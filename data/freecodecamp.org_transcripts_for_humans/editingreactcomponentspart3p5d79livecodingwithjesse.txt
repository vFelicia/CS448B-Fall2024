With timestamps:

00:02 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:04 - with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're
00:07 - gonna be working with react again and
00:10 - lately I've been working through all the
00:12 - issues in the github repo the links in
00:15 - the description if you want to check out
00:16 - that repo and I think we're just gonna
00:19 - continue on with that today
00:23 - so last week we did and the we check out
00:31 - the the latest on the repos here I think
00:36 - we worked on that jobs component yeah
00:44 - yeah I think we did that so I don't know
00:47 - that we got to add entirely finished so
00:54 - maybe we'll finish that up and then
00:58 - we'll move on to something else
01:00 - so I think that was issue one number 107
01:11 - yes we'll start out with that let me
01:14 - switch up my screen over here and I'm
01:18 - gonna check the live chat quickly before
01:21 - we get started we got a few questions
01:24 - right off the bat guru says q please
01:27 - explain the header customize for
01:30 - different devices there's a sidebar a
01:33 - drawer and links in the app bar or
01:35 - welcoming to other devices app are links
01:38 - move to sidebar also explain multiple
01:42 - menus in sidebar oh yeah so the the
01:53 - header is just CSS so it's just media
01:58 - queries so it just detects the width of
02:02 - the screen and when the width of the
02:03 - screen is small it hides part of the
02:09 - part of the markup there
02:13 - when it's larger it shows it okay so
02:16 - those are just media queries and then
02:19 - the sidebar menu which let me get a
02:21 - browser window over here so we can see
02:26 - it so we got a localhost I think I have
02:36 - it running
02:37 - I had it running did that break
02:41 - something
02:56 - it works so that side drawer it just has
03:06 - collapsible so there's a collapsible
03:09 - component that comes with material UI so
03:12 - we've just nested those collapsible
03:14 - elements within within the different
03:18 - menus here so certain of these options
03:24 - are collapsible right so that allows us
03:29 - to go pretty deep with the navigation
03:31 - without being overwhelming you know at
03:34 - first because most of it is hidden and I
03:39 - think we've done streams on on how we
03:42 - built that so if you want to like really
03:44 - detailed like how we coded all that you
03:48 - know check back on some of the streams
03:50 - when we were you know doing the side
03:53 - drawer subtypes oh sorry about the yarn
03:59 - I think sometimes we would title the
04:02 - stream to a bar or things like that all
04:11 - right let me I see that there's a little
04:13 - bit more in the chat but I want to go
04:14 - ahead and get started and then after our
04:16 - first Pomodoro session I'm gonna come
04:18 - back and answer some things in the chat
04:19 - so hello to everyone who's please in
04:21 - here now but let's let's get started on
04:24 - this so I have a Pomodoro timer on one
04:27 - of my other screens and I'm going to
04:29 - start that a 25-minute session and after
04:34 - that 25 minutes we'll do a little
04:36 - question in the answer and and we'll go
04:40 - from there
04:43 - Bogdan said he looked shattered me I
04:47 - don't know why I feel really tired and I
04:54 - my eyes like look really tired oh no I
05:01 - should Jin had more caffeine before we
05:03 - started okay so we're gonna start with
05:08 - that jobs component
05:10 - so let me close out some of these tabs
05:13 - and we don't need right now here we go
05:17 - we're gonna do this job list because
05:19 - that's what the last thing that we did
05:20 - work on and see if we have yeah let's go
05:35 - let's see what we have on the screen
05:37 - first
05:37 - I think that was HR and then yeah yeah
05:42 - okay now I remember this
05:43 - there's several URLs now that we have
05:45 - set up that will take us to the same
05:47 - page and what we what we were planning
05:52 - on doing was adding some filtering but
05:59 - you know what I think I don't know why I
06:02 - didn't realize this last week but but
06:04 - realistically you know we rarely have
06:07 - more than 10 job listings at one time I
06:10 - don't think that that justifies spending
06:14 - as much time as we would need to spend
06:16 - on all this filtering and building the
06:19 - UI for the filters because if there's
06:24 - only let's say ten or less jobs that's
06:27 - not really a lot to scroll through so I
06:30 - say we put that on hold and that could
06:33 - be one of the things that can be done at
06:36 - some point after launch and what we need
06:41 - to do right now then is just work on
06:45 - basically two things one we need to
06:48 - include a little bit more info so if
06:52 - we're not going to have a the property
06:56 - have this be sortable we should at least
06:58 - let people know if possible like what
07:01 - department this is in although I don't
07:05 - know that we have all the data for the
07:07 - different staff departments we do for
07:09 - faculty departments but then we should
07:12 - let them know whether or not it's a
07:13 - faculty or staff job and then also we
07:19 - need to have some way of taking
07:24 - something off the list so you know a lot
07:28 - of these jobs they're not open anymore
07:29 - so we don't want to list them so I think
07:33 - it's probably worthwhile to have a
07:36 - keeper listing at least for a while you
07:40 - know in our database but we don't want
07:45 - to have it be visible so that might
07:47 - simply be you know going into WordPress
07:50 - and switching that over to a draft
07:52 - instead of a published post you know
07:56 - maybe that'll be the easiest way to do
07:58 - it but what to think about that but
08:01 - first things first let's just clean this
08:02 - up and let's make this look you know as
08:04 - good as we can make it look without
08:09 - spending too much time on it
08:21 - so in the component itself I think
08:25 - everything is is okay for the for this
08:29 - job list AAS component yeah so at this
08:36 - point well we can make it a choice here
08:40 - do we want to make another component for
08:43 - these individual job listings or not I
08:45 - believe we had talked about modifying
08:47 - our faculty was it our faculty list yeah
08:55 - you know what we ended up we did make a
08:58 - job list I thought we made a jobless
08:59 - component alright so since we made a
09:08 - jobless component I don't know I'm sorry
09:13 - for some reason I was thinking we had a
09:15 - component but maybe we don't you know
09:24 - for now let's build it out here we'll
09:26 - see how big it is if it seems like it's
09:29 - way too big and we should move it to
09:30 - another component we'll do that but
09:32 - let's not optimize prematurely okay so I
09:38 - am gonna leave this up though and
09:39 - actually this might be too small for you
09:41 - oh I'm sorry I'll make it a little
09:43 - bigger here I'm gonna leave this up just
09:46 - so that we remember what our structure
09:48 - is to get data and let's see what else
09:54 - we can get out of here so right now all
09:58 - we're doing is just displaying the job
10:01 - title but we should display let's see so
10:11 - we have faculty departments or staff
10:13 - department
10:18 - let's go into our WordPress installation
10:21 - and add in some data for this because we
10:31 - need some data to be there for us to see
10:34 - how it looks and right now we don't
10:35 - really have any so it's fine where those
10:42 - jobs are and I'm just gonna open up the
10:50 - first couple of these just so we can get
10:54 - some data
11:04 - okay they did show up all right so
11:06 - accounting clerk this is a staff job and
11:14 - since we don't have a large staff
11:16 - departments filled out here I'm not
11:18 - gonna worry about that right now this is
11:23 - operation support clerk it's also staff
11:26 - job let's see what this one is faculty
11:33 - secretary even though that's a faculty
11:39 - secretary that still falls under staff
11:41 - so faculty would just be strictly
11:44 - professors online enrollment counselor
11:56 - that's a staff job and then that's also
11:59 - admissions so we can actually we can
12:01 - click that one okay so it looks like
12:03 - we're gonna have mostly staff jobs
12:05 - except this one was faculty and we
12:07 - already set that up so at least we have
12:12 - those those all set up now and let me
12:14 - close out of most of those all right now
12:18 - we'll have a little bit of data to work
12:19 - with and we can go through now and grab
12:25 - the data that we need but what we also
12:28 - need to do is make sure that we check
12:31 - first because we could definitely get
12:32 - errors here because sometimes if there's
12:36 - no data this is just gonna be completely
12:39 - empty so we can't just try to find
12:42 - what's there because we'll get an error
12:45 - if you let's say there are no staff
12:51 - depart there's no staff Department
12:53 - selected or something like that so let's
12:57 - go through
13:03 - we're gonna have to do everything within
13:05 - this component here and I think that
13:10 - what I'd like to do is maybe make a few
13:13 - constants to make this look a little bit
13:16 - a little bit cleaner we could we could
13:22 - put our checks you know inside our
13:26 - component but it's gonna make our markup
13:28 - look messy so let's do let's do it like
13:30 - this so what we're gonna do is put our
13:33 - curly brackets here and so normally we
13:38 - can it's just an arrow function just
13:40 - Auto returns anything so if it was all
13:42 - in the same line you wouldn't even have
13:43 - to put anything you could just return
13:44 - what was there or you can put
13:46 - parentheses which is usually as
13:50 - recommended if you do multi-line things
13:52 - just so you more like readability I'm
13:56 - not even sure it's 100% necessary but if
14:00 - we want to start putting in variables
14:02 - and things first we need to put these
14:05 - brackets in there and then we also need
14:07 - to return so we we need a return
14:13 - statement now out of this whereas before
14:16 - you know we didn't need that return
14:18 - safely so let's copy this inside here so
14:25 - we're still gonna return the same thing
14:27 - for now we're just gonna make a few
14:29 - variables and we add it in an extra
14:31 - paren so we're gonna take one out so
14:35 - we're even down there but then now what
14:37 - we can do here is as we're looping
14:41 - through all of the objects in this jobs
14:48 - data array now we can pull out pieces
14:52 - okay so we're gonna do const we'll call
14:59 - this const this
15:07 - yet we'll call this category and then
15:13 - we'll do another one we'll call this
15:16 - department launch department okay so for
15:23 - a category what we need to make sure of
15:26 - is like what at what point do we need to
15:32 - stop and check to make sure something's
15:34 - there so if you're not sure what I'm
15:35 - talking about right now it'll make sense
15:37 - once we actually get this going so for
15:42 - now we can go and use this tool that
15:45 - we've been using pretty frequently which
15:48 - I have been calling what do I call it
15:55 - I've been calling this graphic UL but I
15:59 - watched the YouTube video recently where
16:01 - someone called it graphical which now
16:04 - makes a lot of sense so let me know in
16:06 - the chat I'll learn in the comments do
16:08 - you pronounce this graphical or graph e
16:11 - qo obviously the term graphical makes a
16:15 - lot more sense cuz that's like a real
16:17 - word so so now I feel a bit silly but
16:25 - it's always hard to know how to
16:26 - pronounce things when you just see the
16:29 - spelling and you never you never hear it
16:31 - okay so this is not updated data this is
16:37 - from the last search that I did but this
16:39 - will be better for illustrating the
16:41 - point since we have so much data missing
16:44 - so we go in here and our first like if
16:48 - we were to be looping over this right we
16:51 - go data jobs edges okay so this is the
16:54 - array we're looping through here this
16:55 - edges array and then the first object in
16:58 - the edges array is this object here so
17:02 - let's zoom in so we just are dealing
17:04 - with this one object first so we go to
17:07 - this one object we go to node and then
17:12 - within that that node we can see
17:20 - we have job categories edges and then
17:24 - edges in this case is another array of
17:28 - objects so if we wanted to select this
17:32 - we would say edges zero and that would
17:36 - give us this one and then we could go
17:38 - dot node dot slug right and that that
17:42 - would work but if we went down here and
17:47 - we did staff departments dot edges dot
17:52 - dot edges 0 dot node right there is no
17:56 - node right we're gonna get an error so
17:58 - we can't just say ok like let's let's
18:02 - get these in a straightforward way so
18:04 - what we need to do is have some sort of
18:06 - check to say like ok we can see edges do
18:11 - we want to check and say if edges dot
18:14 - length is greater than 0 then do we go
18:19 - forward you know maybe that's what we
18:22 - want to do ok so let's try that check
18:24 - first because it looks like based on the
18:27 - structure as long as edges has a length
18:32 - of greater than 0 that means there's
18:34 - something in here and so we should be
18:38 - able to get the data then so that's the
18:41 - first check we're gonna go with so
18:47 - here's what we're gonna do we so since
18:52 - we're already in let me show you so from
18:55 - our perspective this has already been
18:57 - done
18:58 - right now we're strictly in here right
19:02 - so when we look in here that first array
19:07 - is called job I'm sorry that first
19:11 - object is called job so we need to go
19:14 - job node job categories and then check
19:19 - the length of edges right so john node
19:29 - edges
19:31 - dot length is greater than zero so if
19:40 - the length of that of edges is greater
19:43 - than zero we're gonna do a little
19:45 - ternary here so it's like like a little
19:47 - if statement so if it's greater than
19:49 - zero then let's let's go ahead and get
19:52 - that value so let's go job node edges 0
20:01 - dot node dot one was a slug got slug
20:09 - okay now if it's not we want to return
20:17 - [Music]
20:21 - will should return I don't know
20:27 - false
20:29 - let's return false we're gonna do
20:38 - something similar for Department and you
20:44 - know maybe we should do we should split
20:47 - it up and say like faculty and staff
20:55 - Department right I week we could
21:03 - probably do it so that we could check
21:05 - for for either one right in the same
21:08 - constant but I don't I don't really want
21:15 - to I think that would look kind of
21:16 - complex and I don't mind adding one more
21:20 - constant in here so I'm just gonna take
21:24 - this and copy it and we're gonna do the
21:32 - same thing
21:36 - let's see whoops I forgot job categories
21:41 - didn't I yeah it's a job node let's go
21:51 - jog all right that was lowercase there
22:02 - we go all right so I'm assuming somebody
22:06 - caught that in the chat so sorry I
22:08 - didn't look down at the chat but okay
22:14 - oops and I only did it for that lower
22:16 - one did not do this all right great
22:27 - since job categories we want to do the
22:29 - same thing down here for faculty
22:32 - departments okay faculty departments and
22:45 - then down here we'll just copy and paste
22:49 - that and change faculty to staff okay I
23:02 - don't know why I'm trying to work with
23:04 - this tiny space we really don't need any
23:06 - of this other stuff right now okay so
23:09 - now we have constants for category
23:14 - faculty Department and staff Department
23:16 - if these are present they will these
23:20 - will end up being strings if not they'll
23:24 - just return false so since we have that
23:28 - now we can go down here and display our
23:37 - our information so the first thing we
23:39 - want to display and maybe we'll do it
23:42 - let's do it like this will style it in
23:46 - the minutes this is not gonna look great
23:48 - for now
23:49 - so let's just do a span and we're gonna
23:52 - use dangerously set enter HTML inside
23:55 - this band and we're gonna say category
24:06 - and I guess
24:16 - yet I'm kind of interested to see
24:18 - because I know some of these we don't
24:20 - even have a category for I'm interested
24:21 - to see what this will do if it returns
24:23 - false if it freaks out then throws an
24:28 - error then we'll we'll need to put a
24:30 - check here to make sure category is
24:33 - actually a string and not false
24:36 - otherwise I'm hoping that if we try to
24:41 - put false in here it just won't render
24:47 - okay so we'll test it with this first
24:53 - I'm not even sure what a span will
24:55 - display as hey there we go okay so
25:03 - evidently it actually displays false aha
25:08 - so we definitely need to change that so
25:13 - let's see I wonder if we can put the oh
25:20 - you know we can just do it like this so
25:23 - let's say category and
25:34 - all right so what this will do is just
25:36 - say if category so that means if
25:41 - category exist if it's not false then so
25:45 - it's just going to do the rest of it
25:46 - right so it's sometimes called I think
25:50 - like a short circuit I don't know they
25:54 - call it a short circuit operator but
25:56 - anyway it's just a little shorthand way
25:59 - instead of doing everything for a
26:02 - ternary you just do that so let's make
26:04 - sure What's it telling me I think it's
26:08 - just spacing so I think this is fine
26:10 - it'll work load there we go okay cool
26:23 - so it worked so now this is only
26:27 - rendering if we happen to have the
26:31 - category present which I wonder why we
26:37 - don't have staff present I thought we
26:40 - did put stuff in yeah and I updated it
26:48 - interesting
26:55 - there we go okay so those updates we
26:58 - made are they're wonderful so you know
27:03 - we can add in a few a few things here
27:07 - like see if we can do this inside is
27:14 - that a function I think it is I mean I
27:17 - know you can do it I just I can't
27:19 - remember if you can do that in
27:22 - JavaScript yep you can okay and we could
27:27 - have done we could have done this in CSS
27:34 - anyway I didn't explain what I just
27:37 - meant I I mean I know you can do it in
27:39 - JavaScript but I didn't know if that was
27:40 - the syntax that they clicked so um all
27:48 - right cool so we're gonna do a similar
27:53 - thing for down here and here's what
28:05 - we're gonna do though we're gonna say
28:11 - this is gonna be a bit more tricky so
28:13 - I'm sure there's gonna be more than one
28:14 - way to go about doing this but here's
28:17 - what I'm thinking we'll try first
28:20 - so if faculty department or staff
28:31 - department
28:38 - back department or stats department and
28:47 - you can't Nestor Nerys can you
28:57 - I don't know if you can nest on it yeah
29:03 - alright let's take it back take it back
29:05 - a bit here's what we're gonna do
29:08 - alright so if faculty department then
29:10 - we're gonna say faculty if there's a
29:19 - faculty department and then we are going
29:21 - to display it and then if there is a
29:28 - staff department we're gonna display it
29:34 - all right so this is one of those times
29:36 - where it's like first step is make it
29:38 - work right cuz there's probably a way to
29:42 - do this without the repetition that we
29:46 - have here all right so let's see oh yeah
30:01 - there we go
30:02 - okay so we see it's saying nursing and
30:07 - admissions so this is where you have the
30:09 - department but let's see how do we want
30:14 - to do this
30:22 - I don't I don't like that I don't like
30:24 - having the top and the bottom so here's
30:26 - what I want to do instead let's make it
30:29 - so that
30:58 - all right so let's see if we have this
31:00 - then
31:12 - all right let's do this
31:19 - what I want to put in is just a let's do
31:32 - this for now this is going to look weird
31:36 - [Music]
31:39 - gonna do that we're gonna have a nested
31:47 - span
31:56 - alright let's see how this loose
32:08 - okay so we have that there but I
32:10 - definitely want I want a space to put
32:15 - the space
32:27 - see if this will work this is this code
32:34 - is starting to look not so great
32:39 - all right cool it works
32:42 - I don't have used caught what I just did
32:44 - I wanted there to be a space in here so
32:47 - I just put in right we dropped into our
32:50 - curly brackets here which drops us into
32:52 - JavaScript but then I just wanted to
32:55 - return what a space right so that that
33:00 - works now what I want to do is take
33:05 - these and render these up here yeah
33:23 - let's render them up here first and see
33:24 - what we get basically what I what I want
33:29 - is them to be right after this faculty
33:33 - thing here yep all right that works cool
33:38 - so really basic not sure this is what I
33:42 - want to go with you know for for sure
33:48 - but that basically tells us this is a
33:51 - faculty position in the nursing
33:53 - department right cool does that make
34:02 - sense then I think this is cleaner than
34:06 - having it at the top and the bottom okay
34:10 - and then obviously to clean this up a
34:12 - little bit more wood I'd like to do
34:14 - first let me check on the Sam out oh no
34:17 - my timer went off I didn't even know it
34:18 - all right let me go back to the chat
34:21 - right now and answer some questions and
34:23 - before I get too far ahead oh yeah I
34:27 - went way over on my son oh whoa aha code
34:35 - normal sis I'm learning angular is
34:37 - angular fine or should i reconsider
34:38 - reacts
34:40 - it really depends on what you want to do
34:42 - if you want to get a job somewhere and
34:44 - you know they use angular stick with
34:46 - angular I I don't know I mean it it
34:53 - really depends on your your situation
34:55 - your preferences you you do see you see
35:02 - job listings for both and react
35:04 - definitely has more momentum right now
35:08 - but there's still a lot of places that
35:10 - use angular and build things with
35:12 - angular I mean it's back to by by Google
35:15 - so it's it's not like it's going
35:18 - anywhere anytime soon hey Anna and asked
35:28 - how I'm doing not too bad
35:30 - actually I coded in my living room that
35:35 - the rest of my family was gone so I
35:38 - coded in my living room for a while this
35:39 - morning's inside the Sun comes in
35:41 - through the window so I was just kind of
35:43 - like relaxing had the windows open
35:44 - listened to the birds so that was kind
35:46 - of kind of cool
35:47 - through bit through off my schedule is I
35:49 - didn't get my normal workout in in the
35:51 - morning so I'm gonna have to do that
35:52 - after after I stream but otherwise not
35:58 - doing too bad how are you doing in
36:05 - shelter Rovin says do you have to be
36:10 - good in mathematics to study / work in
36:13 - computer science field no not
36:16 - necessarily it depends on what you want
36:19 - to do there are definitely some areas of
36:21 - computer science that require more
36:24 - aptitude and skill with mathematics but
36:28 - if you let's say you wanted to be a
36:30 - front-end developer then I I don't
36:36 - really use any upper level math you know
36:39 - ever how so
36:42 - and yeah that's that's another one are
36:46 - those questions that it really just
36:47 - depends on what you're interested in
36:57 - code normal says I have to work with
36:58 - single page applications with a lot of
37:00 - forms let's say CRM good is react for
37:08 - that type of web app yeah it can be I
37:12 - mean you can definitely handle forms and
37:13 - react we've done forms before it's not
37:17 - it's different than how you'd normally
37:18 - do a form but it's not difficult there
37:29 - I'm really sorry about this name Aero
37:33 - Lua ir e higher so I'm sorry I can't
37:39 - pronounce that let me know how to
37:40 - pronounce it let's pronounce it right
37:43 - but ir e o l UW a says is this visual
37:47 - studio it's visual studio code so oops
37:52 - wrong way yeah so this is the visual
37:54 - studio code or people call it BS code so
37:58 - which is definitely different than
38:00 - visual studio both made by Microsoft
38:04 - though Michael creo says I'm a little
38:08 - upset that y'all work on a graph QL
38:10 - query without me sorry I'll make sure we
38:14 - save all the graph QL queries for you
38:17 - mad justices here says good morning good
38:20 - morning how's it going
38:40 - okay so michael says it's definitely
38:43 - graphical okay I will do my best to
38:46 - remember that and pronounce it correctly
38:59 - hey JavaScript this here says hey what's
39:02 - up having talked to well nothing just
39:04 - working lots of work
39:06 - I got this project that I'm working all
39:09 - day on and then if you know when I try
39:12 - to get time in the evenings I'm working
39:13 - on this this balanced IO app which is
39:20 - really really cool projects so I'm happy
39:22 - to be able to work on it but it's taken
39:26 - a lot
39:35 - Michael krios talking about inline
39:38 - fragments for graph QL okay yeah I
39:44 - haven't I haven't tried in inline
39:49 - fragments I will have to check that out
39:51 - as well
40:03 - Oh mad - you said to go see it thanks
40:05 - for watching
40:18 - whoa Nicky says fallout 76 will be set
40:22 - in West Virginia no way
40:25 - um if y'all don't know I am from West
40:28 - Virginia I don't live in West Virginia
40:30 - right now but I live close to it but I
40:32 - was born and raised in West Virginia so
40:35 - I'm excited I'm definitely gonna check
40:37 - out the trailer to that later today okay
40:43 - let me answer a few more questions since
40:45 - I went over on my Pomodoro session I'll
40:49 - go over a bit on the question and answer
40:51 - session here before we finish this
40:53 - component up
40:57 - hey hard shits here how's it goin hard
40:59 - [ __ ]
41:24 - javascript is Jesse you can press f5 to
41:27 - refresh they don't always have to move
41:29 - the pointers and stop the browser yeah I
41:32 - just it's just to have it I mean I know
41:34 - that you can use the keyboard shortcut
41:36 - but yeah I'll just need to force myself
41:41 - if I force myself to use it for a while
41:43 - then I'll remember it
41:44 - I'm I've been so used to having the auto
41:48 - refresh work that I never I never need
41:51 - to manually refresh but when I'm doing
41:54 - these streams the OBS uses so many
41:59 - resources resources on my computer that
42:01 - the auto refresh just takes too long I'm
42:04 - not patient enough for it so I just keep
42:06 - like spamming the refresh button so
42:09 - anyway thanks to JavaScript it a horse
42:16 - should ask the pom-pom broke so harsh it
42:18 - made the Pomodoro timer that I'm using
42:20 - right now you know the alarm definitely
42:22 - works I just my headphones that are
42:24 - plugged into my phone right now and I'm
42:28 - listening Spotify to save some of the
42:31 - processing power on my computer for the
42:34 - stream so I have my computer volume
42:38 - turned all the way down and didn't hear
42:41 - the timer but yeah the timer I always
42:44 - hear the timer from from Paul Paul
42:52 - alright I'm gonna go back I got through
42:55 - most of the questions I'm gonna go back
42:57 - now we're gonna do one more problem into
42:59 - our session and finish up some stuff
43:01 - with this component so let's see okay so
43:13 - we've got these listings now we are
43:18 - listing whether it's faculty or staff
43:21 - and if there is a department selected we
43:25 - also list that if not it just doesn't
43:28 - display anything there but this doesn't
43:31 - look great so and it also doesn't have a
43:36 - length
43:37 - we want to have lengths to a page that
43:42 - has some info so that's what we need to
43:51 - add and we need to add in the link let's
43:53 - do the link first cuz that's that's a
43:54 - necessary functional thing and then
43:57 - depending on how much time we have then
43:59 - we can look at you know maybe switching
44:02 - up you know how these how these look
44:04 - your styling a bit okay so for our
44:10 - length we can use where's our slopes I
44:16 - know we're grabbing this look somewhere
44:18 - and we're already using it yep
44:19 - so we're already using for our key this
44:22 - job node slug right and let's see we
44:27 - need to check to see what what the
44:32 - current website is using do we really
44:37 - need to know we don't yeah I don't think
44:43 - we do right cuz job listings expire so
44:45 - frequently we don't have really have to
44:47 - follow the old pattern but let's see
44:49 - what they use if it's reasonable then
44:52 - we'll use the same URL structure
44:54 - if not we'll switch it up so let's go to
44:57 - Franciscan dot edu slash HR and I guess
45:07 - I could have gone into faculty openings
45:09 - or something but this will be okay all
45:15 - right so let's go into faculty openings
45:19 - I do want to make sure I get a count
45:25 - here so there's only two here let's go
45:28 - to staff opening I said earlier that we
45:31 - never have more than like ten job
45:32 - openings at once so now I want to make
45:34 - sure that was true
45:43 - yep I think we have nine total actually
45:47 - and this is interesting the clinical
45:49 - nursing clinical instructor is actually
45:52 - listed under staff openings that's crazy
45:56 - okay let's go read more it looks like
46:01 - it's just HR VP development all right
46:06 - let's make sure that's really the
46:08 - structure cuz that seems to me like that
46:10 - could get a little okay alright so they
46:21 - don't really have a clear pattern here
46:24 - so what I'm seeing is for these
46:28 - positions that are kind of like lower
46:30 - down in the organization
46:33 - it's the URL is HR slash staff opening
46:37 - slash and then the name of the position
46:40 - and usually with like a date tagged on
46:44 - at the end of it
46:45 - but for these upper-level positions like
46:47 - vice-president it's actually HR slash in
46:51 - this case VP development so a vice
46:53 - president of development so they're not
46:57 - included under staff in the URL
47:01 - structure and then for faculty openings
47:05 - I'm assuming that it's gonna be slash
47:08 - faculty yes it's gonna say slash faculty
47:14 - opening / oh okay yeah all right
47:20 - interesting
47:27 - yeah I'm not gonna keep those let's
47:31 - switch it up and here's what we'll do
47:35 - so let's look at our server for a minute
47:40 - to see what we're doing with with these
47:43 - types of things so let's find okay so we
47:47 - already having an HR here we can go HR
47:52 - and then faculty opening staff openings
47:55 - and what else did we have careers yeah
48:02 - so let's go let's have it be HR careers
48:06 - so HR slash careers slash whatever the
48:14 - job title is or whatever the slug is for
48:18 - that particular job
48:27 - yeah that seems more straightforward we
48:30 - don't have to maintain this this
48:33 - structure of multiple pages and things
48:36 - for the different categories and we'll
48:40 - keep it like that for everything and
48:41 - since we're just saying careers from
48:46 - from what I see from the old structure
48:48 - is that somebody must have taken issue
48:50 - with people higher up being counted to
48:53 - staff or with faculty being counted as
48:55 - staff or staff yeah it's amazing like
49:00 - how much terminology like upsets people
49:05 - and makes people like people get really
49:08 - into this terminology I don't know if
49:11 - it's everywhere but at a university is
49:12 - for sure like well this person is a
49:15 - doctor and this personally as their
49:16 - masters so you can't call them this or
49:18 - that like it's wild so anyway we're
49:22 - gonna get rid of all that and we're just
49:24 - gonna say careers and leave it at that
49:34 - okay so let's make our route now what
49:40 - we'll need to do is say so far page with
49:48 - careers I just set up a route with three
49:52 - things on it recently how did I do that
49:58 - let me scroll through for a second and
50:00 - see which one I set up I think I put it
50:02 - up here up at the top okay
50:19 - [Music]
50:22 - that's not thought it was departments I
50:24 - guess not
50:37 - it wasn't for that I can't remember what
50:44 - it's for I noticed her [ __ ] said
50:46 - something about this object being really
50:49 - long yeah it's getting really long and
50:51 - that's what I mean I've been afraid of
50:52 - that for a while now I hope out how long
50:56 - this is this is getting alright so since
51:09 - I can't find where I did this I'm just
51:13 - gonna try to make this work right now
51:18 - which I just lost my spot here
51:21 - HR alright so we're gonna say HR if we
51:35 - go to careers jobless so let's go with
51:40 - the type all right so what we need to
51:44 - pass along is so if we go to careers
51:52 - it's going to render jobless as the page
51:58 - don't want that right so we want to say
52:13 - this is gonna be tough how am I gonna
52:15 - handle this
52:30 - I should hold on this thing hard she
52:32 - says I will rewrite that surveyed aijs
52:34 - file using SQLite or sequel Lite DB in a
52:41 - PR if I a time sequel I tis a file DB
52:45 - there will only be a DB sequel a file on
52:48 - the root of your project
52:56 - all right that's interesting I haven't
52:59 - noticed any issues with this being too
53:02 - slow and other the only issue I've had
53:06 - is just it just takes a while to scroll
53:09 - so I usually just use a search right so
53:13 - I just find where I'm at but if it would
53:17 - increase the speed I'm open to other
53:20 - other solutions but anyway so here's
53:25 - what I want to do for the page so I do
53:29 - have it set up
53:50 - I just need to direct these to the
53:53 - single job page which did we already
53:57 - create that let's see where's our pages
54:06 - here
54:16 - now we didn't even create it yet huh
54:22 - yeah we need to do that but for now I
54:25 - guess I'll just call it job job Jas
54:30 - so what I can do is thirdly this will
54:39 - work but it's not gonna be ideal is
54:41 - gonna get a job so basically any time we
54:48 - see that there are three yeah anytime
54:53 - there are three parameters in that URL
54:56 - it's gonna automatically go to thirdly
54:59 - which is okay unless we have some other
55:05 - places like some other instances in the
55:15 - HR pages that have three then it's gonna
55:19 - mess things up so I may have to rewrite
55:22 - some stuff in the router or something to
55:25 - deal with this or I'll just have to look
55:28 - at my router a little bit more and see
55:29 - if I've already dealt with it and just
55:31 - can't remember
55:34 - and then here under type we're gonna say
55:47 - actually we don't need to worry about
55:49 - type do we no we don't
56:00 - we don't necessarily have to worry about
56:03 - type since we have a custom query for
56:09 - that particular part okay let's just
56:19 - leave it for now we'll leave it that
56:22 - leave this off we definitely will need
56:25 - the ID though so so we already have that
56:32 - default in there looks so the ID is
56:36 - basically what's gonna tell graph QL
56:39 - what piece of content to get so thirdly
56:45 - he's gonna be
56:56 - if I need to do it like that careers
57:01 - what if I can just go with careers I
57:11 - don't I don't I think about it this
57:17 - should be fine this should just pick up
57:22 - it should pick these up automatically
57:25 - and send it to this component all right
57:28 - that should work okay I spent a lot more
57:34 - time on that than I anticipated but now
57:41 - we can go back to our job list and we
57:44 - can say that we are gonna add a link in
57:48 - here there we go so let's make this a
58:04 - link I'm gonna have to look up how I do
58:08 - links cuz I haven't made one for a while
58:11 - next link all right there we go
58:18 - it's a link prefetch there we go
58:30 - so link prefetch a true profile link so
58:36 - that's not what we need right now what
58:39 - we wanted to get is /hr slash we're
58:50 - gonna use a template literal here so
58:53 - we're gonna say /hr slash careers slash
59:00 - and then we're gonna come in with
59:03 - variable which will end up being for
59:10 - this particular thing the slug so it'll
59:13 - be job no slug
59:24 - and down here we can end our links I
59:35 - don't know what did I do
59:42 - I think I got rid of the h2 accidentally
59:50 - there we go
60:02 - yeah it should be yes you were
60:22 - okay
60:29 - still getting a lot of weird red lines
60:33 - here see if it broke yeah Oh links not
60:38 - defined
60:45 - all right so let's pull in link so we're
60:56 - using link instead of an a tag so that
61:00 - we can have some client-side routing
61:07 - happening so there-there won't need to
61:09 - be a page refresh
61:23 - cool
61:29 - okay so it did when we clicked it it did
61:34 - take us somewhere else but of course
61:35 - that page doesn't exist because we
61:37 - didn't set that up yet so that is
61:42 - working
61:42 - I will definitely want to do Styles link
61:56 - is gonna be
62:13 - we're gonna do cursor:pointer for length
62:16 - all right and so that way it'll look
62:19 - like it's clickable and is it styles is
62:34 - it classes class name class is created
62:40 - okay
62:52 - okay
62:56 - let's make sure that that words
63:07 - I remembered the this time to use to use
63:17 - my refresh shortcut oops I accidentally
63:24 - clicked it all right I need to put this
63:40 - maybe I need to put it on the h2
63:52 - there we go okay all right so now it
64:00 - looks like it's clickable much better
64:05 - okay so in terms of functionality this
64:10 - does what it needs to do now it has a
64:12 - list it gives us basic information and
64:14 - it's clickable in terms of style it's
64:24 - not great so that'll be the next step
64:28 - which probably won't do on this stream
64:30 - so my Pomodoro session is just about
64:34 - over about three minutes and then I'll
64:36 - go back and do some more question
64:37 - answers Wow and I've got a lot of
64:41 - messages from work let me check really
64:42 - quick all right so those some of the
64:47 - work messages are just about where we're
64:49 - gonna go for launch
64:52 - all right so I think I'm good I have
64:58 - some work emails I'm I'm actually really
65:02 - amazed by how many icons are across
65:03 - itself my phone right now okay cool
65:12 - nothing nothing urgent so
65:23 - let me I'm gonna commit this now before
65:32 - I forget whoops
65:41 - and add it all your on CM so we're
65:53 - adding a new feature and what we're
65:56 - adding is category links to just okay
66:18 - that works and there are no breaking
66:22 - changes but it does affect an open issue
66:25 - we're gonna say yes and what do we say
66:28 - that was issue 107 I believe this issue
66:32 - 107 I can double check
66:34 - yeah 107 so we're gonna say this is
66:40 - regarding number 107
66:59 - hopefully this passes everything it
67:06 - always makes me nervous when it takes a
67:08 - while yeah alright what did I do
67:11 - each female entities must be escaped or
67:16 - my 108
67:26 - and one night scene this does not make
67:37 - very much sense
67:43 - I messed up something here sits freakin
67:47 - out
67:47 - indentation come on
68:01 - oh I see
68:22 - why would you tell me we're trying to do
68:33 - it like this I don't think it likes that
68:36 - I have these brackets out there
69:04 - it's upset
69:08 - [Music]
69:09 - alright let's share this
69:18 - if I can get it to work right now I'll
69:21 - just answer some questions and then I'll
69:22 - do it afterwards
70:02 - all right let's grow up and yeah it
70:09 - worked I got that saving just in time
70:12 - all right awesome I'm gonna do questions
70:19 - now
70:44 - Wow y'all been talking a lot in the chat
70:48 - I keep scrolling up trying to find where
70:50 - I left off I think I found it the vibe
71:00 - house says I correct me if that's the
71:04 - wrong pronunciation but they say how can
71:06 - I learn to develop progressive web apps
71:10 - with react if I am new to react Jas I
71:15 - would use something like create react
71:18 - app to start out with because it's
71:21 - pretty much ready to go to be a
71:23 - progressive web app right off the bat
71:25 - that would be the easiest way to get
71:27 - started with it so just follow their
71:30 - documentation as well and you know make
71:32 - sure you're doing everything you need to
71:34 - for it to be a progressive web app Eric
71:44 - says I'm learning both react both rails
71:46 - and react can you do a tutorial mixing
71:49 - it so I have a full stack application
71:51 - tutorial unfortunately I don't know any
71:54 - rails so I wouldn't be the right person
71:56 - to make that tutorial my wife is
72:00 - actually learning rails and react right
72:02 - now so maybe at some point she can do a
72:04 - tutorial for that but if anybody knows
72:10 - of a tutorial out there or if you build
72:12 - something with rails and react please
72:14 - let us know in the chat another error Oh
72:18 - No oh just a timeout it's just timing
72:21 - out because I have OBS running so it's
72:25 - taking too long so I'll just run it
72:27 - after the stream is over
72:44 - flexy says are you good at drawing and
72:46 - painting do you think I can be a
72:47 - front-end developer without being the
72:49 - greatest painter AHA yeah yeah for sure
72:54 - I'm I don't consider myself good at
72:57 - drawing or painting at all so that
73:00 - doesn't really matter there are some
73:02 - front-end developers that that are more
73:04 - creative in that area and they can do
73:06 - some design work but to be a front-end
73:09 - developer you don't have to have any
73:11 - artistic ability now that you know at
73:14 - least in the traditional sense of
73:15 - painting and drawing sculpting things
73:19 - like that if you wanted to be a designer
73:24 - it could be a lot more helpful though
73:27 - but I don't know that it would be
73:29 - necessary
73:44 - Rolle hate says what's the deadline for
73:46 - this project the deadline is kind of
73:48 - fluid right now we had some self-imposed
73:50 - deadlines that we push back for like
73:54 - various reasons so there's not a set
73:59 - deadline right now I would like to
74:01 - launch it before the end of the month
74:03 - I'm just not sure it kind of depends I
74:08 - have some some other people that are
74:10 - gonna help me work on the data that's
74:12 - the date has really been the thing
74:14 - that's taking up almost all of my time
74:16 - the only time I work on react stuff
74:19 - anymore is for the streams and the whole
74:21 - rest of the time I'm I'm just pulling in
74:24 - data and building out those routes so I
74:28 - just work with the the node router that
74:31 - we have and with WordPress data and
74:35 - that's it and I'm hoping to get some
74:38 - help with the data side of things and if
74:42 - that's the case then I can start to move
74:43 - really fast with finishing up the the
74:46 - you know react stuff and the styling and
74:50 - I think it could work but it just all
74:52 - depends on how much it works out you
74:54 - know if the people that are helping are
74:56 - you are able to go through it fast they
75:00 - don't have a lot of questions then that
75:02 - would be great if it ends up that you
75:06 - know they're not really like confident
75:07 - in their skills and I have to take a lot
75:09 - of time that to help them through it
75:11 - I don't know maybe not this month so
75:15 - definitely sometime within this month or
75:19 - next month though I think it's very
75:21 - reasonable and and I would be very
75:25 - surprised if it goes longer than within
75:29 - another month
75:39 - oh man Michael creo says no offense
75:44 - Jesse how could you tell the difference
75:45 - between before and after fallout in West
75:48 - Virginia yeah I mean they're all right
75:54 - West Virginia is a very poor state I'll
75:57 - give you that but it's also a very
75:59 - beautiful state it has a huge percentage
76:03 - of the state is covered in forests nice
76:09 - there's a lot of natural beauty in the
76:12 - state you know some of the cities are a
76:15 - bit rundown not you know not that much
76:18 - in terms of industry happening but you
76:23 - know it just depends on where you're at
76:24 - you know there's some place in West
76:26 - Virginia that are pretty rough and the
76:27 - poverty is like really really high
76:31 - poverty rates so yeah but some places
76:38 - look pretty bad
76:58 - Christian asked about which shortcut are
77:00 - you using forgetting cursor where the
77:02 - other word was highlighted command B so
77:06 - you talking about multiple cursors so I
77:09 - can go like like that for me it's
77:13 - command D that's what it wasn't Adam and
77:16 - I brought over all the Adam keyboard
77:19 - shortcuts when I switch to vs code so I
77:22 - don't know if it is command E and if
77:25 - you're on Windows I think it would be
77:28 - ctrl D I don't know if it's like that by
77:32 - default in Visual Studio code and it may
77:34 - be different in other editors when I
77:42 - don't like a song I keep pressing my
77:44 - keyboard to skip ahead and forgetting
77:46 - that I'm listening to these songs on my
77:48 - phone
77:50 - I'm glad you can't see me defend
78:00 - so Michael says if they based it here in
78:03 - Mississippi I'd ask the same question
78:41 - hi Michael creo says hey a VP position
78:44 - sign me up yeah go go Eddie you try to
78:50 - apply I imagine it's gonna be pretty
78:53 - tough for that spot
79:03 - Harshit says is it necessary for the
79:05 - site to have 100% URL backward
79:07 - compatibility not 100% so in most places
79:12 - yes but there are some areas where we
79:15 - can change it so in areas where content
79:17 - expires so for instance in events that
79:23 - right now on the site they don't keep
79:24 - events around they expire and then you
79:26 - can't get to the URLs anymore so we
79:28 - don't have to worry about those we also
79:30 - don't have to worry about it in job
79:32 - listings because they expire as well so
79:35 - those two areas I'm not worried about
79:37 - and then in the news I'm not gonna worry
79:45 - about it because they're just too many
79:46 - news posts and the URLs don't match up
79:54 - with the slugs like as they got pulled
79:56 - in from one database to the other so at
79:59 - some point if we have you know maybe a
80:02 - student worker who needs some extra work
80:04 - to do they could go through and try to
80:06 - make the slugs match up with what the
80:08 - old URLs were but it's not a priority
80:10 - for me those pages are rarely visited
80:24 - glad to ask what editor I use Visual
80:27 - Studio code
80:50 - Harshad s asking shredder run Apache
80:53 - bench on this and see the request for a
80:56 - second yeah I don't have a patchy bench
80:58 - installed right now I have been worried
81:01 - about the speed of requests having to go
81:05 - through all this so I did have an idea
81:08 - to split this up into multiple objects
81:12 - so that a request would never have to
81:16 - search through the whole thing so I mean
81:21 - that's still possible to do but if like
81:23 - you know if you have an even better idea
81:25 - than that I'm you know I'm definitely
81:26 - willing to go for that
81:31 - how cool Aniki says so some of the
81:34 - locations in West Virginia that the
81:35 - video game are going to be a set in is
81:38 - Camden Park The Greenbrier
81:40 - New River Gorge Bridge and West Virginia
81:42 - University wow that's cool I I used to
81:48 - live in the city that West Virginia
81:50 - University is located in sits Morgantown
81:52 - West Virginia so I live there for two
81:54 - years and I've been to that too
81:56 - Morgantown many many times for American
82:02 - football games
82:13 - Michael said I think you kids are
82:15 - crawling around in the ductwork yeah my
82:18 - oldest my so my my two sons have they
82:21 - share a room and then my daughter share
82:23 - a room although Cordelia always ends up
82:26 - sleeping in in my room so she's not
82:30 - really in there but anyway this my son's
82:33 - room is right above me so if you hear a
82:36 - lot of noise it's probably them like
82:37 - jumping around and playing jeff says
82:44 - practicing their ninja skills
82:45 - probably
83:00 - Anoop Singh says can we make and make
83:04 - OLX like app with react yes I'm not sure
83:07 - what kind of app that is so if you get
83:10 - explain it to me a little bit more I'd
83:11 - be happy to try to answer let's see our
83:19 - ketose TV says it didn't know where to
83:23 - ask this got my first real project I
83:25 - learned react recently and want to use
83:28 - it but don't know Redux gravity well
83:31 - should I take the risk of simply using
83:33 - expression jQuery now you shouldn't need
83:36 - to use jQuery if you were thinking about
83:39 - using jQuery to fetch data just use
83:45 - fetch so don't use Ajax use fetch
83:48 - instead so just check out the fetch API
83:50 - if you have to fetch on the server you
83:54 - can get you can get packages to help
83:57 - fetch work on server-side and
84:00 - client-side you can definitely use
84:02 - Express though Express is used
84:06 - frequently with react so yeah but
84:11 - anything that you're gonna want to try
84:13 - to do with jQuery you can already do
84:14 - just with react so with the exception I
84:20 - would say of like asynchronous calls
84:24 - you're gonna want to use fetch
84:35 - oh oh I see sorry I misunderstood so it
84:39 - wasn't he wasn't talking about using
84:42 - [Music]
84:45 - jQuery with react it was using jQuery
84:48 - instead of react yeah I mean that's a
84:53 - tough thing it just depends on how
84:54 - confident you are in your react skills
84:56 - if if the project has if you have a
85:00 - decent amount of time to finish the
85:01 - project I would say try to go with react
85:03 - and learn what you need to if it's a
85:05 - very short timeline and you just need to
85:07 - get it done then go with what you're
85:10 - good at right now so that I mean that'll
85:15 - be a call you'll have to make because
85:17 - you you know you know your own skills
85:19 - and your own timeline so yeah but I mean
85:24 - I I understand sometimes you just have
85:25 - to get stuff done so it's totally fine
85:28 - you know if you got a we got a you
85:31 - jQuery instead and then just try to keep
85:34 - getting better at you react until you
85:35 - get to the point where you know you're
85:38 - you're faster with that then you are
85:40 - with the jQuery that's exactly how I
85:42 - went about learning react as well I had
85:45 - kind of a mix between jQuery and reacts
85:49 - until I could take that step and just do
85:51 - you know straight react development
86:05 - Andre says do you use Gatsby in projects
86:09 - and do you like it I tried some stuff
86:12 - with Gatsby I did like Gatsby but I'm I
86:15 - haven't used it a lot not that there's
86:18 - anything wrong with Gatsby it's just
86:20 - this past project well I considered
86:23 - using Gatsby I ended up going with next
86:26 - I was more familiar with next anyway and
86:30 - then this project has been going on for
86:32 - a really long time I just haven't had an
86:34 - opportunity to try out Gatsby again but
86:38 - from what I did use of it it was it was
86:40 - pretty nice michael says do you really
86:47 - need users to know it's a staff or
86:48 - faculty job probably not but I I think
86:55 - like people at the university probably
86:59 - faculty members will I had imagined
87:04 - there would be some faculty members that
87:06 - might be a bit upset that they no longer
87:07 - have their own page for faculty listings
87:10 - and so being able to have them quickly
87:16 - tell like what's faculty in what staff
87:18 - position is probably better so but I I
87:24 - don't think it's necessary for the from
87:27 - a user's perspective but I'm just trying
87:30 - to avoid or have like an alternative
87:34 - solution there that I think will
87:37 - probably be acceptable or at least will
87:39 - sound reasonable so if anybody alright
87:43 - I'm gonna give you some insight into the
87:46 - psychology of me trying to get people on
87:49 - board and supporting my project so I
87:52 - always assume there gonna be some people
87:54 - that are gonna be opposed to something
87:56 - that I'm doing like no matter what
87:58 - they're not gonna like it
88:00 - even if I explain it and I'm not worried
88:03 - about those people but it making
88:06 - consensus around a lot of the other
88:08 - people who their minds are a little bit
88:10 - more open to the ideas so if the person
88:14 - that let's say doesn't want it to change
88:17 - would strongly
88:18 - object to not having a separate faculty
88:21 - page I could say something like you know
88:24 - this is gonna make things a lot more
88:25 - simple for people to find jobs if
88:28 - somebody were to accidentally go to the
88:30 - staff page they might not even realize
88:32 - that there are faculty positions and
88:35 - since we're listing very clearly which
88:37 - ones our staff and which ones are
88:38 - faculty we no longer need the two pages
88:40 - and it'll still be clear to the user
88:43 - which one it is
88:44 - possibly even more clear than it was
88:46 - before that logic may or may not
88:50 - convince the one person or it's a few
88:52 - people that are really one at the old
88:54 - way but all the rest of the people that
88:57 - would be listening to that logic would
88:59 - probably think yeah that makes sense
89:03 - and they'd be on board and that's really
89:05 - what matters because there's not really
89:08 - one or two people together that could be
89:11 - rail you know whole project or you know
89:13 - unless they were like let's say the
89:14 - president of the university or something
89:16 - right
89:17 - as long as majority the other people can
89:21 - see the reasonableness of what I'm
89:24 - trying to do that's enough to to keep
89:29 - going with the project so that's usually
89:32 - how I go into thinking about presenting
89:35 - things and meetings and things like that
89:38 - I just I try to think and identify like
89:41 - who's gonna have these objections and
89:44 - it's it's not how do I convince them
89:46 - it's how do I convince everybody else
89:49 - that my way is more reasonable and
89:52 - usually more user friendly cost
89:55 - effective and you know things like that
89:59 - so I find that that works well otherwise
90:06 - if you try to keep pushing the issue
90:09 - with that one person you run the risk of
90:11 - seeming like obsessed with one issue
90:14 - right or and so that you end up looking
90:19 - worse
90:22 - to everybody else right I don't know if
90:25 - that makes sense to you all but
90:28 - sometimes you just need but you don't
90:31 - need everybody on your side
90:32 - you just need most of the people on your
90:34 - side or the right people on your side in
90:36 - an organization so that that's what I
90:40 - usually try to do and I just always
90:42 - assume that there that I'm not always
90:44 - gonna get everybody on my side so it's
90:46 - just a matter of like managing the few
90:49 - people that won't be and so anyway
90:52 - that's my that strategy has worked for
90:57 - pretty much every project there there
90:59 - may be only been one or two times where
91:00 - I really had to implement something that
91:02 - I didn't think was a good idea but you
91:08 - know and we're talking over the course
91:09 - of almost three years now so I you know
91:11 - it's worked out fairly well
91:22 - Aniki says also isn't faculty
91:25 - technically staff I don't eat it
91:27 - at a university it's it's a weird
91:31 - situation where like faculty are in a
91:37 - class all their own in terms of like
91:40 - their compensation their hours like how
91:43 - they're treated is different than the
91:48 - rest of the people that work in the
91:49 - university you know they can get like
91:51 - tenure which is basically like a
91:52 - guarantee that you won't get fired
91:54 - unless you do something illegal nobody
91:59 - on staff ever gets that right and
92:02 - they're even weird things like if you're
92:04 - a part-time faculty member that makes
92:06 - you an adjunct adjuncts don't have
92:09 - access to a lot of things but if you're
92:12 - a part-time staff member you get a lot
92:14 - more benefits and then then a part-time
92:18 - faculty member would but if you're a
92:20 - full-time faculty member you you get
92:23 - more benefits than a full-time staff
92:25 - member would in terms of when you think
92:27 - about things like tenure and being able
92:31 - to take sabbaticals and things like that
92:33 - so it's definitely a huge difference
92:36 - between faculty and staff what's
92:40 - expected of them and how they're
92:42 - compensated at least in the United
92:46 - States it's like that I don't know if
92:48 - it's like that in other countries
93:10 - so he's saying extra Andre saying
93:13 - there's an extra slash in length all
93:16 - right let me check that up was that the
93:18 - problem the whole time no that's not it
93:23 - oh yeah job list they must have gotten
93:30 - taken care of then the extra slash
94:05 - John says I setup hey John thanks for
94:08 - joining us and John says I setup vs code
94:11 - editor to use the es lint RC to run
94:15 - prettier on each file save it's amazing
94:18 - behind says thanks Nikki yeah for sure
94:21 - it's so awesome if you're not using
94:23 - prettier check it out
94:27 - think about using it like try it it's it
94:31 - auto formats your code for you it's so
94:36 - much nicer to not have to worry about
94:38 - the format of your code as you're coding
94:41 - it's just like you have this freedom to
94:43 - just just get the code out there and
94:45 - then you know like it's gonna be alright
94:50 - everything's gonna be formatted the way
94:52 - you want it no matter how messy you put
94:54 - it in it's really cool
95:25 - Carlos is here hey Carlos how's it going
95:43 - Oh her she is asking about feedback on
95:46 - components for a JavaScript AF UI
95:49 - let me pull that up on the screen really
95:51 - quick here so I'm gonna paste this in
96:05 - the chat as well so y'all can check it
96:08 - out
96:10 - so harsh has been working on this
96:13 - these UI components here so you know
96:22 - check them out it's got some really nice
96:24 - ones here like so anyway you know check
96:29 - out the link check them out give some
96:31 - feedback if you can I think it's I don't
96:38 - know why it's not working
96:39 - some of it just might be my my machine
96:44 - being slow because we're running OBS
96:48 - yeah but you can see a lot of cool
96:51 - components UI components yeah so let him
96:56 - know what you think if you if you get a
96:58 - chance
97:11 - Bharath says could you suggest any web
97:14 - resources or books to understand the
97:15 - best react.js file component structure
97:17 - oh I don't really know myself I've
97:21 - always just kind of stuck with the
97:22 - structure that I've seen like in the
97:26 - tutorials for whatever I'm using so in
97:29 - this case it's next j/s I don't know I
97:34 - guess I haven't even thought about file
97:36 - structure for a while you know I just I
97:38 - just do what I've been doing you know
97:41 - that's interesting question yeah I
97:44 - really don't know anything off the top
97:46 - of my head if anybody else knows of
97:47 - anything that can help please put it in
97:50 - the live chat our ketose says thank you
97:58 - for the answer I was recently working on
98:00 - stuff using react and didn't really know
98:02 - how to pass data from my express server
98:04 - to the front end kind of how it works
98:06 - with ejs or handlebars okay so you know
98:11 - what try out next Jas because they have
98:16 - a like a function that allows you to
98:20 - pass things a little bit more easily
98:22 - from front end and to do server-side
98:26 - rendering or from the back in the front
98:27 - end do server-side rendering so try it
98:30 - out it might work for your use case its
98:34 - react but it just adds a little bit of
98:37 - stuff on to react so yeah I'm not sure
98:41 - but it might be worth to try to just
98:44 - check out the documentation and see if
98:46 - it would if it would be a fit for you
98:50 - are ketose also says might be a very new
98:53 - question but is is that where Redux our
98:56 - graph geo comes in which one do I need
98:58 - to learn first yeah no it's not a new
99:01 - question I don't think it is but so
99:06 - basically graph QL think of graph QL
99:10 - just like you would think of a REST API
99:12 - okay you're gonna use graph QL is just a
99:17 - way to query a database
99:23 - right so it's just like making an API
99:26 - call you're just using a little bit
99:28 - different format than you would for a
99:30 - normal REST API once you get that data
99:33 - and you could if you want to use Redux
99:36 - to store that data and to make sure it
99:39 - gets to the right components you don't
99:42 - have to use Redux though but if you had
99:47 - a large project it could potentially be
99:50 - beneficial to manage all your state and
99:53 - all your data with Redux hopefully that
99:58 - makes sense let me know if if it doesn't
100:02 - if you need some more explanation see uh
100:13 - John says are you just gonna take that
100:16 - server JS file and shrink it to a dozen
100:18 - lines of code it will call backend API
100:20 - I don't doubt Archie could do it our
100:23 - students work is always so impressive
100:26 - but I know our shoot is very busy right
100:29 - now with school and with side projects
100:31 - and things so school needs to come first
100:35 - I have Michael says I'm just hoping when
100:43 - harsh eight codes the next Facebook
100:45 - before he's eighteen that he remembers
100:47 - us
100:47 - if harsh it's eighteen and he's not a
100:49 - millionaire in charge of his own company
100:52 - by then then I'm gonna start my own
100:54 - company and hire hard [ __ ] because he's
101:00 - he is definitely an impressive coder
101:19 - our ketose is asking about context react
101:23 - context API I haven't used it myself yet
101:29 - but it kept that could potentially be
101:32 - used instead of Redux and might be a
101:34 - little bit more simple to use yet Redux
101:38 - is a bit tricky to learn at first so I
101:42 - will say that if you can do it if you
101:45 - can do what you need to in react without
101:47 - Redux I think that's usually a good
101:49 - thing bringing in Redux can definitely
101:52 - help make a complex thing more simple
101:55 - but if you're just dealing with simple
101:57 - stuff it can end up making a little bit
101:59 - more complex than you you need it to be
102:29 - see
102:55 - michael creo says you might want to stop
102:57 - talking about your job now i don't know
103:00 - was that when i was talking about my
103:02 - meetings and stuff
103:26 - okay Carlos says we were talking earlier
103:29 - about using rails with react Carlos says
103:33 - I would create an API and then use react
103:36 - to fetch the data all right that makes a
103:38 - lot of sense yeah and then I mean you
103:40 - could build things out just like we're
103:42 - doing use either graph QL or fetch to
103:46 - get data depending on how you built your
103:49 - back-end yeah that's a good idea
104:17 - Kyle says how do you link graph QL with
104:20 - my sequel well in this particular case
104:25 - we've done it through a wordpress plugin
104:29 - I don't know how you would do it
104:32 - by default you know you'd have to build
104:34 - I don't think you'd have to build your
104:36 - own thing from scratch I'm sure there's
104:38 - probably some sort of setup that's out
104:41 - there are ready to do it I'm just not
104:43 - aware of it but we wanted to use
104:45 - WordPress for content management because
104:47 - it would be user friendly for those
104:51 - people who are going to be managing the
104:52 - content so we use the WP graph QL
104:56 - plug-in to be able to call that my
105:01 - sequel database where all that wordpress
105:03 - data is stored and send that to our
105:08 - react project our ketosis thanks a lot
105:18 - Jesse first time on the live stream
105:19 - we'll definitely come back again
105:21 - awesome awesome I'm glad you liked it I
105:23 - glad glad it was useful two years so
105:26 - yeah I'll definitely be looking out for
105:28 - you in future live streams
105:32 - Harshit says I will be 18 on December of
105:35 - 2019 all right so I got to start my plan
105:40 - my plan to start my own company then in
105:43 - hire hire you Harshit will have to have
105:47 - to have everything ready by December of
105:49 - 2019
106:03 - Shubham says what's the best way to
106:06 - learn Redux I learned Redux from the
106:12 - react Udacity nano degree Udacity react
106:17 - nano degree
106:18 - yeah so that's what I learned it I'm not
106:26 - really sure if you wanted a free
106:28 - resource so that's a paid program if you
106:32 - wanted a free resource maybe check out I
106:38 - [Music]
106:40 - don't really know does anybody know the
106:42 - best free resource for learning Redux
106:45 - there's got to be something good out
106:47 - there I mean I was thinking probably
106:49 - west boss has stuff but I'm not sure if
106:51 - it's free stuff or paid I don't know
107:32 - see Heath says so what are we building
107:36 - here now we just finished up with some
107:39 - coding for the day right now I'm doing
107:40 - some question and answer but we are
107:42 - building a react site with that gets
107:47 - data with graph QL yes so that's what we
107:53 - were working with today we do have it
107:56 - connected to my sequel database with via
107:59 - WordPress and the WP graph QL plug-in
108:03 - but we were just doing some you know
108:06 - there's some basic component editing
108:09 - doing a little bit of work with a custom
108:12 - node router
108:29 - qasas Thank You Jessie you're welcome no
108:32 - problem Christian says Jessie wanna
108:40 - wanna partner up
108:45 - okay harsh it says there is a free
108:48 - restore resource so West boss does have
108:51 - a free Redux course so I haven't done
108:53 - any of his courses but I've heard good
108:55 - things about them so you may want to
108:57 - check them out
108:58 - Harshit says it's at learn redux calm Oh
109:05 - Carlos just thought about free code
109:07 - can't Redux lessons I didn't realize
109:09 - that they had Redux on the new
109:10 - curriculum okay awesome that's good to
109:13 - know
109:13 - I'm actually check that out okay Nikki
109:20 - says Dan Abramov has a Redux course on
109:23 - egghead and it's also good cool our Tito
109:28 - says the thing I was working on was a
109:30 - simple contact form after sending an
109:32 - email or not from Express back and I
109:34 - wanted to pass a message to my component
109:37 - and changes state according to show
109:39 - message okay cool yeah we're we're doing
109:42 - some of that in some of the the previous
109:43 - projects that we've done on the stream
109:45 - so it's definitely possible with react
109:47 - it's it's not it's not that difficult so
109:54 - yeah you can definitely use react to
109:56 - that
110:06 - krishna says how do i get into the new
110:08 - courses and free code camp
110:10 - I think everybody's automatically in now
110:12 - I think they switched it all over
110:15 - correct me if I'm wrong but I thought
110:18 - that's what it was and I think it's
110:20 - learned free code camp torgue and gets
110:23 - where they're at now okay
110:28 - I've gotten through all the chat stuff
110:31 - so I'm gonna finish up now been a
110:34 - decently long stream thank you all so
110:37 - much for all your help and I'll most
110:42 - likely be streaming again tomorrow yeah
110:47 - we'll probably be doing similar stuff
110:49 - react component stuff so I guess until
110:58 - tomorrow
110:59 - have a wonderful day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're gonna be working with react again and lately I've been working through all the issues in the github repo the links in the description if you want to check out that repo and I think we're just gonna continue on with that today so last week we did and the we check out the the latest on the repos here I think we worked on that jobs component yeah yeah I think we did that so I don't know that we got to add entirely finished so maybe we'll finish that up and then we'll move on to something else so I think that was issue one number 107 yes we'll start out with that let me switch up my screen over here and I'm gonna check the live chat quickly before we get started we got a few questions right off the bat guru says q please explain the header customize for different devices there's a sidebar a drawer and links in the app bar or welcoming to other devices app are links move to sidebar also explain multiple menus in sidebar oh yeah so the the header is just CSS so it's just media queries so it just detects the width of the screen and when the width of the screen is small it hides part of the part of the markup there when it's larger it shows it okay so those are just media queries and then the sidebar menu which let me get a browser window over here so we can see it so we got a localhost I think I have it running I had it running did that break something it works so that side drawer it just has collapsible so there's a collapsible component that comes with material UI so we've just nested those collapsible elements within within the different menus here so certain of these options are collapsible right so that allows us to go pretty deep with the navigation without being overwhelming you know at first because most of it is hidden and I think we've done streams on on how we built that so if you want to like really detailed like how we coded all that you know check back on some of the streams when we were you know doing the side drawer subtypes oh sorry about the yarn I think sometimes we would title the stream to a bar or things like that all right let me I see that there's a little bit more in the chat but I want to go ahead and get started and then after our first Pomodoro session I'm gonna come back and answer some things in the chat so hello to everyone who's please in here now but let's let's get started on this so I have a Pomodoro timer on one of my other screens and I'm going to start that a 25minute session and after that 25 minutes we'll do a little question in the answer and and we'll go from there Bogdan said he looked shattered me I don't know why I feel really tired and I my eyes like look really tired oh no I should Jin had more caffeine before we started okay so we're gonna start with that jobs component so let me close out some of these tabs and we don't need right now here we go we're gonna do this job list because that's what the last thing that we did work on and see if we have yeah let's go let's see what we have on the screen first I think that was HR and then yeah yeah okay now I remember this there's several URLs now that we have set up that will take us to the same page and what we what we were planning on doing was adding some filtering but you know what I think I don't know why I didn't realize this last week but but realistically you know we rarely have more than 10 job listings at one time I don't think that that justifies spending as much time as we would need to spend on all this filtering and building the UI for the filters because if there's only let's say ten or less jobs that's not really a lot to scroll through so I say we put that on hold and that could be one of the things that can be done at some point after launch and what we need to do right now then is just work on basically two things one we need to include a little bit more info so if we're not going to have a the property have this be sortable we should at least let people know if possible like what department this is in although I don't know that we have all the data for the different staff departments we do for faculty departments but then we should let them know whether or not it's a faculty or staff job and then also we need to have some way of taking something off the list so you know a lot of these jobs they're not open anymore so we don't want to list them so I think it's probably worthwhile to have a keeper listing at least for a while you know in our database but we don't want to have it be visible so that might simply be you know going into WordPress and switching that over to a draft instead of a published post you know maybe that'll be the easiest way to do it but what to think about that but first things first let's just clean this up and let's make this look you know as good as we can make it look without spending too much time on it so in the component itself I think everything is is okay for the for this job list AAS component yeah so at this point well we can make it a choice here do we want to make another component for these individual job listings or not I believe we had talked about modifying our faculty was it our faculty list yeah you know what we ended up we did make a job list I thought we made a jobless component alright so since we made a jobless component I don't know I'm sorry for some reason I was thinking we had a component but maybe we don't you know for now let's build it out here we'll see how big it is if it seems like it's way too big and we should move it to another component we'll do that but let's not optimize prematurely okay so I am gonna leave this up though and actually this might be too small for you oh I'm sorry I'll make it a little bigger here I'm gonna leave this up just so that we remember what our structure is to get data and let's see what else we can get out of here so right now all we're doing is just displaying the job title but we should display let's see so we have faculty departments or staff department let's go into our WordPress installation and add in some data for this because we need some data to be there for us to see how it looks and right now we don't really have any so it's fine where those jobs are and I'm just gonna open up the first couple of these just so we can get some data okay they did show up all right so accounting clerk this is a staff job and since we don't have a large staff departments filled out here I'm not gonna worry about that right now this is operation support clerk it's also staff job let's see what this one is faculty secretary even though that's a faculty secretary that still falls under staff so faculty would just be strictly professors online enrollment counselor that's a staff job and then that's also admissions so we can actually we can click that one okay so it looks like we're gonna have mostly staff jobs except this one was faculty and we already set that up so at least we have those those all set up now and let me close out of most of those all right now we'll have a little bit of data to work with and we can go through now and grab the data that we need but what we also need to do is make sure that we check first because we could definitely get errors here because sometimes if there's no data this is just gonna be completely empty so we can't just try to find what's there because we'll get an error if you let's say there are no staff depart there's no staff Department selected or something like that so let's go through we're gonna have to do everything within this component here and I think that what I'd like to do is maybe make a few constants to make this look a little bit a little bit cleaner we could we could put our checks you know inside our component but it's gonna make our markup look messy so let's do let's do it like this so what we're gonna do is put our curly brackets here and so normally we can it's just an arrow function just Auto returns anything so if it was all in the same line you wouldn't even have to put anything you could just return what was there or you can put parentheses which is usually as recommended if you do multiline things just so you more like readability I'm not even sure it's 100% necessary but if we want to start putting in variables and things first we need to put these brackets in there and then we also need to return so we we need a return statement now out of this whereas before you know we didn't need that return safely so let's copy this inside here so we're still gonna return the same thing for now we're just gonna make a few variables and we add it in an extra paren so we're gonna take one out so we're even down there but then now what we can do here is as we're looping through all of the objects in this jobs data array now we can pull out pieces okay so we're gonna do const we'll call this const this yet we'll call this category and then we'll do another one we'll call this department launch department okay so for a category what we need to make sure of is like what at what point do we need to stop and check to make sure something's there so if you're not sure what I'm talking about right now it'll make sense once we actually get this going so for now we can go and use this tool that we've been using pretty frequently which I have been calling what do I call it I've been calling this graphic UL but I watched the YouTube video recently where someone called it graphical which now makes a lot of sense so let me know in the chat I'll learn in the comments do you pronounce this graphical or graph e qo obviously the term graphical makes a lot more sense cuz that's like a real word so so now I feel a bit silly but it's always hard to know how to pronounce things when you just see the spelling and you never you never hear it okay so this is not updated data this is from the last search that I did but this will be better for illustrating the point since we have so much data missing so we go in here and our first like if we were to be looping over this right we go data jobs edges okay so this is the array we're looping through here this edges array and then the first object in the edges array is this object here so let's zoom in so we just are dealing with this one object first so we go to this one object we go to node and then within that that node we can see we have job categories edges and then edges in this case is another array of objects so if we wanted to select this we would say edges zero and that would give us this one and then we could go dot node dot slug right and that that would work but if we went down here and we did staff departments dot edges dot dot edges 0 dot node right there is no node right we're gonna get an error so we can't just say ok like let's let's get these in a straightforward way so what we need to do is have some sort of check to say like ok we can see edges do we want to check and say if edges dot length is greater than 0 then do we go forward you know maybe that's what we want to do ok so let's try that check first because it looks like based on the structure as long as edges has a length of greater than 0 that means there's something in here and so we should be able to get the data then so that's the first check we're gonna go with so here's what we're gonna do we so since we're already in let me show you so from our perspective this has already been done right now we're strictly in here right so when we look in here that first array is called job I'm sorry that first object is called job so we need to go job node job categories and then check the length of edges right so john node edges dot length is greater than zero so if the length of that of edges is greater than zero we're gonna do a little ternary here so it's like like a little if statement so if it's greater than zero then let's let's go ahead and get that value so let's go job node edges 0 dot node dot one was a slug got slug okay now if it's not we want to return will should return I don't know false let's return false we're gonna do something similar for Department and you know maybe we should do we should split it up and say like faculty and staff Department right I week we could probably do it so that we could check for for either one right in the same constant but I don't I don't really want to I think that would look kind of complex and I don't mind adding one more constant in here so I'm just gonna take this and copy it and we're gonna do the same thing let's see whoops I forgot job categories didn't I yeah it's a job node let's go jog all right that was lowercase there we go all right so I'm assuming somebody caught that in the chat so sorry I didn't look down at the chat but okay oops and I only did it for that lower one did not do this all right great since job categories we want to do the same thing down here for faculty departments okay faculty departments and then down here we'll just copy and paste that and change faculty to staff okay I don't know why I'm trying to work with this tiny space we really don't need any of this other stuff right now okay so now we have constants for category faculty Department and staff Department if these are present they will these will end up being strings if not they'll just return false so since we have that now we can go down here and display our our information so the first thing we want to display and maybe we'll do it let's do it like this will style it in the minutes this is not gonna look great for now so let's just do a span and we're gonna use dangerously set enter HTML inside this band and we're gonna say category and I guess yet I'm kind of interested to see because I know some of these we don't even have a category for I'm interested to see what this will do if it returns false if it freaks out then throws an error then we'll we'll need to put a check here to make sure category is actually a string and not false otherwise I'm hoping that if we try to put false in here it just won't render okay so we'll test it with this first I'm not even sure what a span will display as hey there we go okay so evidently it actually displays false aha so we definitely need to change that so let's see I wonder if we can put the oh you know we can just do it like this so let's say category and all right so what this will do is just say if category so that means if category exist if it's not false then so it's just going to do the rest of it right so it's sometimes called I think like a short circuit I don't know they call it a short circuit operator but anyway it's just a little shorthand way instead of doing everything for a ternary you just do that so let's make sure What's it telling me I think it's just spacing so I think this is fine it'll work load there we go okay cool so it worked so now this is only rendering if we happen to have the category present which I wonder why we don't have staff present I thought we did put stuff in yeah and I updated it interesting there we go okay so those updates we made are they're wonderful so you know we can add in a few a few things here like see if we can do this inside is that a function I think it is I mean I know you can do it I just I can't remember if you can do that in JavaScript yep you can okay and we could have done we could have done this in CSS anyway I didn't explain what I just meant I I mean I know you can do it in JavaScript but I didn't know if that was the syntax that they clicked so um all right cool so we're gonna do a similar thing for down here and here's what we're gonna do though we're gonna say this is gonna be a bit more tricky so I'm sure there's gonna be more than one way to go about doing this but here's what I'm thinking we'll try first so if faculty department or staff department back department or stats department and you can't Nestor Nerys can you I don't know if you can nest on it yeah alright let's take it back take it back a bit here's what we're gonna do alright so if faculty department then we're gonna say faculty if there's a faculty department and then we are going to display it and then if there is a staff department we're gonna display it all right so this is one of those times where it's like first step is make it work right cuz there's probably a way to do this without the repetition that we have here all right so let's see oh yeah there we go okay so we see it's saying nursing and admissions so this is where you have the department but let's see how do we want to do this I don't I don't like that I don't like having the top and the bottom so here's what I want to do instead let's make it so that all right so let's see if we have this then all right let's do this what I want to put in is just a let's do this for now this is going to look weird gonna do that we're gonna have a nested span alright let's see how this loose okay so we have that there but I definitely want I want a space to put the space see if this will work this is this code is starting to look not so great all right cool it works I don't have used caught what I just did I wanted there to be a space in here so I just put in right we dropped into our curly brackets here which drops us into JavaScript but then I just wanted to return what a space right so that that works now what I want to do is take these and render these up here yeah let's render them up here first and see what we get basically what I what I want is them to be right after this faculty thing here yep all right that works cool so really basic not sure this is what I want to go with you know for for sure but that basically tells us this is a faculty position in the nursing department right cool does that make sense then I think this is cleaner than having it at the top and the bottom okay and then obviously to clean this up a little bit more wood I'd like to do first let me check on the Sam out oh no my timer went off I didn't even know it all right let me go back to the chat right now and answer some questions and before I get too far ahead oh yeah I went way over on my son oh whoa aha code normal sis I'm learning angular is angular fine or should i reconsider reacts it really depends on what you want to do if you want to get a job somewhere and you know they use angular stick with angular I I don't know I mean it it really depends on your your situation your preferences you you do see you see job listings for both and react definitely has more momentum right now but there's still a lot of places that use angular and build things with angular I mean it's back to by by Google so it's it's not like it's going anywhere anytime soon hey Anna and asked how I'm doing not too bad actually I coded in my living room that the rest of my family was gone so I coded in my living room for a while this morning's inside the Sun comes in through the window so I was just kind of like relaxing had the windows open listened to the birds so that was kind of kind of cool through bit through off my schedule is I didn't get my normal workout in in the morning so I'm gonna have to do that after after I stream but otherwise not doing too bad how are you doing in shelter Rovin says do you have to be good in mathematics to study / work in computer science field no not necessarily it depends on what you want to do there are definitely some areas of computer science that require more aptitude and skill with mathematics but if you let's say you wanted to be a frontend developer then I I don't really use any upper level math you know ever how so and yeah that's that's another one are those questions that it really just depends on what you're interested in code normal says I have to work with single page applications with a lot of forms let's say CRM good is react for that type of web app yeah it can be I mean you can definitely handle forms and react we've done forms before it's not it's different than how you'd normally do a form but it's not difficult there I'm really sorry about this name Aero Lua ir e higher so I'm sorry I can't pronounce that let me know how to pronounce it let's pronounce it right but ir e o l UW a says is this visual studio it's visual studio code so oops wrong way yeah so this is the visual studio code or people call it BS code so which is definitely different than visual studio both made by Microsoft though Michael creo says I'm a little upset that y'all work on a graph QL query without me sorry I'll make sure we save all the graph QL queries for you mad justices here says good morning good morning how's it going okay so michael says it's definitely graphical okay I will do my best to remember that and pronounce it correctly hey JavaScript this here says hey what's up having talked to well nothing just working lots of work I got this project that I'm working all day on and then if you know when I try to get time in the evenings I'm working on this this balanced IO app which is really really cool projects so I'm happy to be able to work on it but it's taken a lot Michael krios talking about inline fragments for graph QL okay yeah I haven't I haven't tried in inline fragments I will have to check that out as well Oh mad you said to go see it thanks for watching whoa Nicky says fallout 76 will be set in West Virginia no way um if y'all don't know I am from West Virginia I don't live in West Virginia right now but I live close to it but I was born and raised in West Virginia so I'm excited I'm definitely gonna check out the trailer to that later today okay let me answer a few more questions since I went over on my Pomodoro session I'll go over a bit on the question and answer session here before we finish this component up hey hard shits here how's it goin hard [ __ ] javascript is Jesse you can press f5 to refresh they don't always have to move the pointers and stop the browser yeah I just it's just to have it I mean I know that you can use the keyboard shortcut but yeah I'll just need to force myself if I force myself to use it for a while then I'll remember it I'm I've been so used to having the auto refresh work that I never I never need to manually refresh but when I'm doing these streams the OBS uses so many resources resources on my computer that the auto refresh just takes too long I'm not patient enough for it so I just keep like spamming the refresh button so anyway thanks to JavaScript it a horse should ask the pompom broke so harsh it made the Pomodoro timer that I'm using right now you know the alarm definitely works I just my headphones that are plugged into my phone right now and I'm listening Spotify to save some of the processing power on my computer for the stream so I have my computer volume turned all the way down and didn't hear the timer but yeah the timer I always hear the timer from from Paul Paul alright I'm gonna go back I got through most of the questions I'm gonna go back now we're gonna do one more problem into our session and finish up some stuff with this component so let's see okay so we've got these listings now we are listing whether it's faculty or staff and if there is a department selected we also list that if not it just doesn't display anything there but this doesn't look great so and it also doesn't have a length we want to have lengths to a page that has some info so that's what we need to add and we need to add in the link let's do the link first cuz that's that's a necessary functional thing and then depending on how much time we have then we can look at you know maybe switching up you know how these how these look your styling a bit okay so for our length we can use where's our slopes I know we're grabbing this look somewhere and we're already using it yep so we're already using for our key this job node slug right and let's see we need to check to see what what the current website is using do we really need to know we don't yeah I don't think we do right cuz job listings expire so frequently we don't have really have to follow the old pattern but let's see what they use if it's reasonable then we'll use the same URL structure if not we'll switch it up so let's go to Franciscan dot edu slash HR and I guess I could have gone into faculty openings or something but this will be okay all right so let's go into faculty openings I do want to make sure I get a count here so there's only two here let's go to staff opening I said earlier that we never have more than like ten job openings at once so now I want to make sure that was true yep I think we have nine total actually and this is interesting the clinical nursing clinical instructor is actually listed under staff openings that's crazy okay let's go read more it looks like it's just HR VP development all right let's make sure that's really the structure cuz that seems to me like that could get a little okay alright so they don't really have a clear pattern here so what I'm seeing is for these positions that are kind of like lower down in the organization it's the URL is HR slash staff opening slash and then the name of the position and usually with like a date tagged on at the end of it but for these upperlevel positions like vicepresident it's actually HR slash in this case VP development so a vice president of development so they're not included under staff in the URL structure and then for faculty openings I'm assuming that it's gonna be slash faculty yes it's gonna say slash faculty opening / oh okay yeah all right interesting yeah I'm not gonna keep those let's switch it up and here's what we'll do so let's look at our server for a minute to see what we're doing with with these types of things so let's find okay so we already having an HR here we can go HR and then faculty opening staff openings and what else did we have careers yeah so let's go let's have it be HR careers so HR slash careers slash whatever the job title is or whatever the slug is for that particular job yeah that seems more straightforward we don't have to maintain this this structure of multiple pages and things for the different categories and we'll keep it like that for everything and since we're just saying careers from from what I see from the old structure is that somebody must have taken issue with people higher up being counted to staff or with faculty being counted as staff or staff yeah it's amazing like how much terminology like upsets people and makes people like people get really into this terminology I don't know if it's everywhere but at a university is for sure like well this person is a doctor and this personally as their masters so you can't call them this or that like it's wild so anyway we're gonna get rid of all that and we're just gonna say careers and leave it at that okay so let's make our route now what we'll need to do is say so far page with careers I just set up a route with three things on it recently how did I do that let me scroll through for a second and see which one I set up I think I put it up here up at the top okay that's not thought it was departments I guess not it wasn't for that I can't remember what it's for I noticed her [ __ ] said something about this object being really long yeah it's getting really long and that's what I mean I've been afraid of that for a while now I hope out how long this is this is getting alright so since I can't find where I did this I'm just gonna try to make this work right now which I just lost my spot here HR alright so we're gonna say HR if we go to careers jobless so let's go with the type all right so what we need to pass along is so if we go to careers it's going to render jobless as the page don't want that right so we want to say this is gonna be tough how am I gonna handle this I should hold on this thing hard she says I will rewrite that surveyed aijs file using SQLite or sequel Lite DB in a PR if I a time sequel I tis a file DB there will only be a DB sequel a file on the root of your project all right that's interesting I haven't noticed any issues with this being too slow and other the only issue I've had is just it just takes a while to scroll so I usually just use a search right so I just find where I'm at but if it would increase the speed I'm open to other other solutions but anyway so here's what I want to do for the page so I do have it set up I just need to direct these to the single job page which did we already create that let's see where's our pages here now we didn't even create it yet huh yeah we need to do that but for now I guess I'll just call it job job Jas so what I can do is thirdly this will work but it's not gonna be ideal is gonna get a job so basically any time we see that there are three yeah anytime there are three parameters in that URL it's gonna automatically go to thirdly which is okay unless we have some other places like some other instances in the HR pages that have three then it's gonna mess things up so I may have to rewrite some stuff in the router or something to deal with this or I'll just have to look at my router a little bit more and see if I've already dealt with it and just can't remember and then here under type we're gonna say actually we don't need to worry about type do we no we don't we don't necessarily have to worry about type since we have a custom query for that particular part okay let's just leave it for now we'll leave it that leave this off we definitely will need the ID though so so we already have that default in there looks so the ID is basically what's gonna tell graph QL what piece of content to get so thirdly he's gonna be if I need to do it like that careers what if I can just go with careers I don't I don't I think about it this should be fine this should just pick up it should pick these up automatically and send it to this component all right that should work okay I spent a lot more time on that than I anticipated but now we can go back to our job list and we can say that we are gonna add a link in here there we go so let's make this a link I'm gonna have to look up how I do links cuz I haven't made one for a while next link all right there we go it's a link prefetch there we go so link prefetch a true profile link so that's not what we need right now what we wanted to get is /hr slash we're gonna use a template literal here so we're gonna say /hr slash careers slash and then we're gonna come in with variable which will end up being for this particular thing the slug so it'll be job no slug and down here we can end our links I don't know what did I do I think I got rid of the h2 accidentally there we go yeah it should be yes you were okay still getting a lot of weird red lines here see if it broke yeah Oh links not defined all right so let's pull in link so we're using link instead of an a tag so that we can have some clientside routing happening so therethere won't need to be a page refresh cool okay so it did when we clicked it it did take us somewhere else but of course that page doesn't exist because we didn't set that up yet so that is working I will definitely want to do Styles link is gonna be we're gonna do cursorpointer for length all right and so that way it'll look like it's clickable and is it styles is it classes class name class is created okay okay let's make sure that that words I remembered the this time to use to use my refresh shortcut oops I accidentally clicked it all right I need to put this maybe I need to put it on the h2 there we go okay all right so now it looks like it's clickable much better okay so in terms of functionality this does what it needs to do now it has a list it gives us basic information and it's clickable in terms of style it's not great so that'll be the next step which probably won't do on this stream so my Pomodoro session is just about over about three minutes and then I'll go back and do some more question answers Wow and I've got a lot of messages from work let me check really quick all right so those some of the work messages are just about where we're gonna go for launch all right so I think I'm good I have some work emails I'm I'm actually really amazed by how many icons are across itself my phone right now okay cool nothing nothing urgent so let me I'm gonna commit this now before I forget whoops and add it all your on CM so we're adding a new feature and what we're adding is category links to just okay that works and there are no breaking changes but it does affect an open issue we're gonna say yes and what do we say that was issue 107 I believe this issue 107 I can double check yeah 107 so we're gonna say this is regarding number 107 hopefully this passes everything it always makes me nervous when it takes a while yeah alright what did I do each female entities must be escaped or my 108 and one night scene this does not make very much sense I messed up something here sits freakin out indentation come on oh I see why would you tell me we're trying to do it like this I don't think it likes that I have these brackets out there it's upset alright let's share this if I can get it to work right now I'll just answer some questions and then I'll do it afterwards all right let's grow up and yeah it worked I got that saving just in time all right awesome I'm gonna do questions now Wow y'all been talking a lot in the chat I keep scrolling up trying to find where I left off I think I found it the vibe house says I correct me if that's the wrong pronunciation but they say how can I learn to develop progressive web apps with react if I am new to react Jas I would use something like create react app to start out with because it's pretty much ready to go to be a progressive web app right off the bat that would be the easiest way to get started with it so just follow their documentation as well and you know make sure you're doing everything you need to for it to be a progressive web app Eric says I'm learning both react both rails and react can you do a tutorial mixing it so I have a full stack application tutorial unfortunately I don't know any rails so I wouldn't be the right person to make that tutorial my wife is actually learning rails and react right now so maybe at some point she can do a tutorial for that but if anybody knows of a tutorial out there or if you build something with rails and react please let us know in the chat another error Oh No oh just a timeout it's just timing out because I have OBS running so it's taking too long so I'll just run it after the stream is over flexy says are you good at drawing and painting do you think I can be a frontend developer without being the greatest painter AHA yeah yeah for sure I'm I don't consider myself good at drawing or painting at all so that doesn't really matter there are some frontend developers that that are more creative in that area and they can do some design work but to be a frontend developer you don't have to have any artistic ability now that you know at least in the traditional sense of painting and drawing sculpting things like that if you wanted to be a designer it could be a lot more helpful though but I don't know that it would be necessary Rolle hate says what's the deadline for this project the deadline is kind of fluid right now we had some selfimposed deadlines that we push back for like various reasons so there's not a set deadline right now I would like to launch it before the end of the month I'm just not sure it kind of depends I have some some other people that are gonna help me work on the data that's the date has really been the thing that's taking up almost all of my time the only time I work on react stuff anymore is for the streams and the whole rest of the time I'm I'm just pulling in data and building out those routes so I just work with the the node router that we have and with WordPress data and that's it and I'm hoping to get some help with the data side of things and if that's the case then I can start to move really fast with finishing up the the you know react stuff and the styling and I think it could work but it just all depends on how much it works out you know if the people that are helping are you are able to go through it fast they don't have a lot of questions then that would be great if it ends up that you know they're not really like confident in their skills and I have to take a lot of time that to help them through it I don't know maybe not this month so definitely sometime within this month or next month though I think it's very reasonable and and I would be very surprised if it goes longer than within another month oh man Michael creo says no offense Jesse how could you tell the difference between before and after fallout in West Virginia yeah I mean they're all right West Virginia is a very poor state I'll give you that but it's also a very beautiful state it has a huge percentage of the state is covered in forests nice there's a lot of natural beauty in the state you know some of the cities are a bit rundown not you know not that much in terms of industry happening but you know it just depends on where you're at you know there's some place in West Virginia that are pretty rough and the poverty is like really really high poverty rates so yeah but some places look pretty bad Christian asked about which shortcut are you using forgetting cursor where the other word was highlighted command B so you talking about multiple cursors so I can go like like that for me it's command D that's what it wasn't Adam and I brought over all the Adam keyboard shortcuts when I switch to vs code so I don't know if it is command E and if you're on Windows I think it would be ctrl D I don't know if it's like that by default in Visual Studio code and it may be different in other editors when I don't like a song I keep pressing my keyboard to skip ahead and forgetting that I'm listening to these songs on my phone I'm glad you can't see me defend so Michael says if they based it here in Mississippi I'd ask the same question hi Michael creo says hey a VP position sign me up yeah go go Eddie you try to apply I imagine it's gonna be pretty tough for that spot Harshit says is it necessary for the site to have 100% URL backward compatibility not 100% so in most places yes but there are some areas where we can change it so in areas where content expires so for instance in events that right now on the site they don't keep events around they expire and then you can't get to the URLs anymore so we don't have to worry about those we also don't have to worry about it in job listings because they expire as well so those two areas I'm not worried about and then in the news I'm not gonna worry about it because they're just too many news posts and the URLs don't match up with the slugs like as they got pulled in from one database to the other so at some point if we have you know maybe a student worker who needs some extra work to do they could go through and try to make the slugs match up with what the old URLs were but it's not a priority for me those pages are rarely visited glad to ask what editor I use Visual Studio code Harshad s asking shredder run Apache bench on this and see the request for a second yeah I don't have a patchy bench installed right now I have been worried about the speed of requests having to go through all this so I did have an idea to split this up into multiple objects so that a request would never have to search through the whole thing so I mean that's still possible to do but if like you know if you have an even better idea than that I'm you know I'm definitely willing to go for that how cool Aniki says so some of the locations in West Virginia that the video game are going to be a set in is Camden Park The Greenbrier New River Gorge Bridge and West Virginia University wow that's cool I I used to live in the city that West Virginia University is located in sits Morgantown West Virginia so I live there for two years and I've been to that too Morgantown many many times for American football games Michael said I think you kids are crawling around in the ductwork yeah my oldest my so my my two sons have they share a room and then my daughter share a room although Cordelia always ends up sleeping in in my room so she's not really in there but anyway this my son's room is right above me so if you hear a lot of noise it's probably them like jumping around and playing jeff says practicing their ninja skills probably Anoop Singh says can we make and make OLX like app with react yes I'm not sure what kind of app that is so if you get explain it to me a little bit more I'd be happy to try to answer let's see our ketose TV says it didn't know where to ask this got my first real project I learned react recently and want to use it but don't know Redux gravity well should I take the risk of simply using expression jQuery now you shouldn't need to use jQuery if you were thinking about using jQuery to fetch data just use fetch so don't use Ajax use fetch instead so just check out the fetch API if you have to fetch on the server you can get you can get packages to help fetch work on serverside and clientside you can definitely use Express though Express is used frequently with react so yeah but anything that you're gonna want to try to do with jQuery you can already do just with react so with the exception I would say of like asynchronous calls you're gonna want to use fetch oh oh I see sorry I misunderstood so it wasn't he wasn't talking about using jQuery with react it was using jQuery instead of react yeah I mean that's a tough thing it just depends on how confident you are in your react skills if if the project has if you have a decent amount of time to finish the project I would say try to go with react and learn what you need to if it's a very short timeline and you just need to get it done then go with what you're good at right now so that I mean that'll be a call you'll have to make because you you know you know your own skills and your own timeline so yeah but I mean I I understand sometimes you just have to get stuff done so it's totally fine you know if you got a we got a you jQuery instead and then just try to keep getting better at you react until you get to the point where you know you're you're faster with that then you are with the jQuery that's exactly how I went about learning react as well I had kind of a mix between jQuery and reacts until I could take that step and just do you know straight react development Andre says do you use Gatsby in projects and do you like it I tried some stuff with Gatsby I did like Gatsby but I'm I haven't used it a lot not that there's anything wrong with Gatsby it's just this past project well I considered using Gatsby I ended up going with next I was more familiar with next anyway and then this project has been going on for a really long time I just haven't had an opportunity to try out Gatsby again but from what I did use of it it was it was pretty nice michael says do you really need users to know it's a staff or faculty job probably not but I I think like people at the university probably faculty members will I had imagined there would be some faculty members that might be a bit upset that they no longer have their own page for faculty listings and so being able to have them quickly tell like what's faculty in what staff position is probably better so but I I don't think it's necessary for the from a user's perspective but I'm just trying to avoid or have like an alternative solution there that I think will probably be acceptable or at least will sound reasonable so if anybody alright I'm gonna give you some insight into the psychology of me trying to get people on board and supporting my project so I always assume there gonna be some people that are gonna be opposed to something that I'm doing like no matter what they're not gonna like it even if I explain it and I'm not worried about those people but it making consensus around a lot of the other people who their minds are a little bit more open to the ideas so if the person that let's say doesn't want it to change would strongly object to not having a separate faculty page I could say something like you know this is gonna make things a lot more simple for people to find jobs if somebody were to accidentally go to the staff page they might not even realize that there are faculty positions and since we're listing very clearly which ones our staff and which ones are faculty we no longer need the two pages and it'll still be clear to the user which one it is possibly even more clear than it was before that logic may or may not convince the one person or it's a few people that are really one at the old way but all the rest of the people that would be listening to that logic would probably think yeah that makes sense and they'd be on board and that's really what matters because there's not really one or two people together that could be rail you know whole project or you know unless they were like let's say the president of the university or something right as long as majority the other people can see the reasonableness of what I'm trying to do that's enough to to keep going with the project so that's usually how I go into thinking about presenting things and meetings and things like that I just I try to think and identify like who's gonna have these objections and it's it's not how do I convince them it's how do I convince everybody else that my way is more reasonable and usually more user friendly cost effective and you know things like that so I find that that works well otherwise if you try to keep pushing the issue with that one person you run the risk of seeming like obsessed with one issue right or and so that you end up looking worse to everybody else right I don't know if that makes sense to you all but sometimes you just need but you don't need everybody on your side you just need most of the people on your side or the right people on your side in an organization so that that's what I usually try to do and I just always assume that there that I'm not always gonna get everybody on my side so it's just a matter of like managing the few people that won't be and so anyway that's my that strategy has worked for pretty much every project there there may be only been one or two times where I really had to implement something that I didn't think was a good idea but you know and we're talking over the course of almost three years now so I you know it's worked out fairly well Aniki says also isn't faculty technically staff I don't eat it at a university it's it's a weird situation where like faculty are in a class all their own in terms of like their compensation their hours like how they're treated is different than the rest of the people that work in the university you know they can get like tenure which is basically like a guarantee that you won't get fired unless you do something illegal nobody on staff ever gets that right and they're even weird things like if you're a parttime faculty member that makes you an adjunct adjuncts don't have access to a lot of things but if you're a parttime staff member you get a lot more benefits and then then a parttime faculty member would but if you're a fulltime faculty member you you get more benefits than a fulltime staff member would in terms of when you think about things like tenure and being able to take sabbaticals and things like that so it's definitely a huge difference between faculty and staff what's expected of them and how they're compensated at least in the United States it's like that I don't know if it's like that in other countries so he's saying extra Andre saying there's an extra slash in length all right let me check that up was that the problem the whole time no that's not it oh yeah job list they must have gotten taken care of then the extra slash John says I setup hey John thanks for joining us and John says I setup vs code editor to use the es lint RC to run prettier on each file save it's amazing behind says thanks Nikki yeah for sure it's so awesome if you're not using prettier check it out think about using it like try it it's it auto formats your code for you it's so much nicer to not have to worry about the format of your code as you're coding it's just like you have this freedom to just just get the code out there and then you know like it's gonna be alright everything's gonna be formatted the way you want it no matter how messy you put it in it's really cool Carlos is here hey Carlos how's it going Oh her she is asking about feedback on components for a JavaScript AF UI let me pull that up on the screen really quick here so I'm gonna paste this in the chat as well so y'all can check it out so harsh has been working on this these UI components here so you know check them out it's got some really nice ones here like so anyway you know check out the link check them out give some feedback if you can I think it's I don't know why it's not working some of it just might be my my machine being slow because we're running OBS yeah but you can see a lot of cool components UI components yeah so let him know what you think if you if you get a chance Bharath says could you suggest any web resources or books to understand the best react.js file component structure oh I don't really know myself I've always just kind of stuck with the structure that I've seen like in the tutorials for whatever I'm using so in this case it's next j/s I don't know I guess I haven't even thought about file structure for a while you know I just I just do what I've been doing you know that's interesting question yeah I really don't know anything off the top of my head if anybody else knows of anything that can help please put it in the live chat our ketose says thank you for the answer I was recently working on stuff using react and didn't really know how to pass data from my express server to the front end kind of how it works with ejs or handlebars okay so you know what try out next Jas because they have a like a function that allows you to pass things a little bit more easily from front end and to do serverside rendering or from the back in the front end do serverside rendering so try it out it might work for your use case its react but it just adds a little bit of stuff on to react so yeah I'm not sure but it might be worth to try to just check out the documentation and see if it would if it would be a fit for you are ketose also says might be a very new question but is is that where Redux our graph geo comes in which one do I need to learn first yeah no it's not a new question I don't think it is but so basically graph QL think of graph QL just like you would think of a REST API okay you're gonna use graph QL is just a way to query a database right so it's just like making an API call you're just using a little bit different format than you would for a normal REST API once you get that data and you could if you want to use Redux to store that data and to make sure it gets to the right components you don't have to use Redux though but if you had a large project it could potentially be beneficial to manage all your state and all your data with Redux hopefully that makes sense let me know if if it doesn't if you need some more explanation see uh John says are you just gonna take that server JS file and shrink it to a dozen lines of code it will call backend API I don't doubt Archie could do it our students work is always so impressive but I know our shoot is very busy right now with school and with side projects and things so school needs to come first I have Michael says I'm just hoping when harsh eight codes the next Facebook before he's eighteen that he remembers us if harsh it's eighteen and he's not a millionaire in charge of his own company by then then I'm gonna start my own company and hire hard [ __ ] because he's he is definitely an impressive coder our ketose is asking about context react context API I haven't used it myself yet but it kept that could potentially be used instead of Redux and might be a little bit more simple to use yet Redux is a bit tricky to learn at first so I will say that if you can do it if you can do what you need to in react without Redux I think that's usually a good thing bringing in Redux can definitely help make a complex thing more simple but if you're just dealing with simple stuff it can end up making a little bit more complex than you you need it to be see michael creo says you might want to stop talking about your job now i don't know was that when i was talking about my meetings and stuff okay Carlos says we were talking earlier about using rails with react Carlos says I would create an API and then use react to fetch the data all right that makes a lot of sense yeah and then I mean you could build things out just like we're doing use either graph QL or fetch to get data depending on how you built your backend yeah that's a good idea Kyle says how do you link graph QL with my sequel well in this particular case we've done it through a wordpress plugin I don't know how you would do it by default you know you'd have to build I don't think you'd have to build your own thing from scratch I'm sure there's probably some sort of setup that's out there are ready to do it I'm just not aware of it but we wanted to use WordPress for content management because it would be user friendly for those people who are going to be managing the content so we use the WP graph QL plugin to be able to call that my sequel database where all that wordpress data is stored and send that to our react project our ketosis thanks a lot Jesse first time on the live stream we'll definitely come back again awesome awesome I'm glad you liked it I glad glad it was useful two years so yeah I'll definitely be looking out for you in future live streams Harshit says I will be 18 on December of 2019 all right so I got to start my plan my plan to start my own company then in hire hire you Harshit will have to have to have everything ready by December of 2019 Shubham says what's the best way to learn Redux I learned Redux from the react Udacity nano degree Udacity react nano degree yeah so that's what I learned it I'm not really sure if you wanted a free resource so that's a paid program if you wanted a free resource maybe check out I don't really know does anybody know the best free resource for learning Redux there's got to be something good out there I mean I was thinking probably west boss has stuff but I'm not sure if it's free stuff or paid I don't know see Heath says so what are we building here now we just finished up with some coding for the day right now I'm doing some question and answer but we are building a react site with that gets data with graph QL yes so that's what we were working with today we do have it connected to my sequel database with via WordPress and the WP graph QL plugin but we were just doing some you know there's some basic component editing doing a little bit of work with a custom node router qasas Thank You Jessie you're welcome no problem Christian says Jessie wanna wanna partner up okay harsh it says there is a free restore resource so West boss does have a free Redux course so I haven't done any of his courses but I've heard good things about them so you may want to check them out Harshit says it's at learn redux calm Oh Carlos just thought about free code can't Redux lessons I didn't realize that they had Redux on the new curriculum okay awesome that's good to know I'm actually check that out okay Nikki says Dan Abramov has a Redux course on egghead and it's also good cool our Tito says the thing I was working on was a simple contact form after sending an email or not from Express back and I wanted to pass a message to my component and changes state according to show message okay cool yeah we're we're doing some of that in some of the the previous projects that we've done on the stream so it's definitely possible with react it's it's not it's not that difficult so yeah you can definitely use react to that krishna says how do i get into the new courses and free code camp I think everybody's automatically in now I think they switched it all over correct me if I'm wrong but I thought that's what it was and I think it's learned free code camp torgue and gets where they're at now okay I've gotten through all the chat stuff so I'm gonna finish up now been a decently long stream thank you all so much for all your help and I'll most likely be streaming again tomorrow yeah we'll probably be doing similar stuff react component stuff so I guess until tomorrow have a wonderful day
