00:05 - hey everybody
00:06 - uh welcome to live coding with jesse i'm
00:09 - jesse
00:10 - and
00:12 - today
00:13 - we're not gonna do what i said we were
00:14 - going to do yesterday
00:16 - which was try out a new javascript cms
00:18 - and i'll explain why in a minute
00:20 - but what we are going to do is
00:23 - pull out some more data from our sql
00:26 - server database
00:27 - and
00:28 - we're going to use
00:31 - our
00:32 - our node.js
00:34 - code that we that harshit wrote
00:37 - and
00:38 - we're going to put it into my sql
00:40 - database using the wordpress api
00:44 - uh we'll pro we'll need to make some
00:46 - custom post types so we'll be working
00:48 - with a wordpress plugin uh we'll bring
00:51 - over that one that we have used on some
00:53 - some other projects that we made
00:55 - and
00:56 - we'll modify that
00:58 - to fit our our first custom post type
01:01 - we'll make will be um
01:04 - faculty
01:06 - so
01:08 - that's what we'll work on the only other
01:10 - thing that i think we'll need to do is
01:12 - we'll have to do something about the way
01:14 - the html is getting pulled in to
01:16 - wordpress so
01:17 - i'm looking up some things on stack
01:19 - overflow that you all had had
01:22 - mentioned
01:24 - last week at some point so we'll try to
01:26 - get that working
01:27 - but
01:29 - we should be able to get a decent amount
01:30 - of work done today
01:33 - i don't have any meetings
01:34 - so we can have a
01:38 - kind of a normal length stream here
01:41 - so for sure i want to try to get into
01:43 - pomodoro sessions of work with questions
01:45 - in between and after
01:47 - and uh depending on how it's going uh
01:50 - maybe we'll go longer uh we'll see
01:52 - and
01:54 - oh i don't have my headphones my music
01:56 - on let's get that going first
01:58 - uh
02:00 - hey everyone seen the live chat blake's
02:03 - mentioning so i did just get a haircut
02:05 - so anyway
02:09 - um
02:11 - yeah so i feel nice and fresh with my
02:13 - hair cut
02:15 - uh if
02:17 - does anyone use spotify that's watching
02:20 - uh so i guess spotify just came out with
02:22 - um
02:25 - well within the last week sometime the
02:27 - your top songs of 2017 playlist
02:30 - uh so
02:32 - i don't know it's pretty fun i
02:33 - definitely wouldn't want to share it
02:35 - with everybody because i'd be
02:36 - embarrassed i'm somewhat embarrassed by
02:38 - some of the songs that it says that i
02:39 - listen to the most
02:41 - but
02:42 - but it is fun going back through and uh
02:45 - projects i was working on when i was
02:48 - listening to certain songs all the time
02:50 - so that's really fun
02:52 - uh just to remember like oh yeah i
02:54 - listened to that all the time when i was
02:56 - working on you know this website
02:59 - so it did bring back memories
03:01 - uh anyway so if you haven't uh looked
03:03 - that up yet uh check out see if you can
03:06 - find your top songs playlist on your
03:08 - spotify account it's it's a lot of fun
03:13 - all right let's
03:16 - uh jordan asks what cms are you porting
03:19 - from the cms is called ektron
03:22 - and
03:24 - i'm not a big fan of it i haven't had a
03:26 - lot of good
03:28 - experiences using ektron uh and it's old
03:31 - and the company that made it got bought
03:33 - out by another company so i don't really
03:35 - think it has much of a future so we need
03:37 - to to be done with it
03:43 - so let
03:45 - i me
03:45 - really need this right now
03:47 - i don't need that
03:49 - let's see where we're going
03:52 - all right i was working on this earlier
03:53 - but i don't think i need it
03:55 - no we don't need that
03:58 - i shouldn't have anything unsafe so i'm
04:00 - gonna not save that
04:03 - um
04:06 - we don't need any of this
04:09 - none of that none of that
04:12 - we need that
04:14 - sorry i just i was not prepared at all i
04:17 - i ran into one of my former students
04:19 - from when i used to teach high school uh
04:21 - when i was getting a haircut and i
04:23 - talked to her for a while afterwards
04:25 - so
04:27 - it set me back a little bit i didn't get
04:29 - as much time to prepare as i normally do
04:34 - um
04:37 - let's see oh
04:41 - you got um question
04:43 - from
04:44 - all right i know how i was supposed to
04:46 - pronounce this
04:48 - on amhel
04:49 - is that how i pronounce it angel
04:52 - let me know i'm trying to pronounce it
04:54 - i'm trying to remember anyway uh asks
04:56 - what's up with the branch on gatsby uh
04:58 - the brainstorm gatsby i haven't worked
05:00 - on but it's i'm leaving it open and i
05:03 - want to try
05:04 - to work on it
05:06 - um
05:07 - i really wanted to try to work on them
05:09 - both a little bit the next branch and
05:10 - the gatsby branch and then test them out
05:12 - and see which one was faster
05:14 - i still would like to do that but
05:16 - realistically i i've got to be conscious
05:18 - of the amount of time we have to
05:20 - complete this project there's still a
05:21 - lot of work to be done and it needs to
05:23 - be done by february
05:25 - so
05:28 - if if we have to
05:31 - i don't know wait and
05:34 - finish that branch like afterwards then
05:36 - that can be pushed so basically it's
05:37 - something that's not necessary for us to
05:39 - do this project can certainly work and
05:41 - we know it can work with next
05:44 - so i think our best bet is to
05:47 - if we need to
05:48 - for time just work on the branch that is
05:50 - using next and work on the gatsby branch
05:54 - later some other time for testing
05:56 - purposes
06:01 - okay
06:07 - blake's asking about question on the fcc
06:10 - slack channel i don't have the slack
06:12 - channel open right now
06:14 - um maybe i can i can take a look at it
06:17 - later on though
06:19 - uh all right so we will need to log into
06:21 - this
06:24 - uh tell me this password got saved
06:35 - why is it not
06:37 - there we go
06:38 - all right
06:40 - okay great
06:46 - so we brought these posts in
06:49 - last time
06:50 - and uh as you can see they came in like
06:55 - actually did it come in
06:57 - right this time
07:07 - that's interesting
07:15 - whoa all right i don't know if any of
07:16 - y'all just caught that
07:19 - so
07:19 - we were having a problem before where um
07:23 - we brought all this data in
07:26 - and these tags weren't there
07:30 - uh so you could see
07:33 - like root list view image detail view
07:36 - image like you know all these custom
07:38 - tags
07:39 - weren't there and we were getting
07:42 - a different view uh so what i just did
07:44 - was
07:45 - if i go to visual and then i go back
07:49 - then you can see all those tags are gone
07:52 - and they're all switched around
07:54 - but if i just go back out to posts and i
07:56 - come back in here
08:04 - you can see the tags are there again
08:08 - so i think we're okay with that the the
08:13 - i'm assuming what would happen is if i
08:15 - switched to visual edited something and
08:18 - then updated it
08:19 - that we would lose these tags
08:24 - so at least this is good news because at
08:26 - first we can still import data without
08:29 - having to fix that problem
08:31 - of the the tags getting uh getting
08:34 - changed
08:37 - but
08:38 - whenever i open this up and let other
08:40 - people come in and start editing i would
08:42 - have to
08:44 - um
08:46 - i'd have to fix that issue
08:48 - so
08:50 - that's actually good because now we
08:52 - don't have to deal with that on today's
08:53 - stream which i kind of i wanted to to
08:55 - fix that before i even started streaming
08:57 - today but i just ran out of time
09:00 - okay cool
09:02 - so
09:03 - at this point then
09:05 - let's let's build a plug-in to make some
09:07 - custom post types
09:10 - and then we'll install that plug-in here
09:13 - on our test wordpress install
09:15 - and then we'll pull over some data
09:22 - yeah okay let's do that
09:24 - so the first thing
09:26 - we'll need to do is grab the plug-in
09:29 - from a previous project
09:32 - i'm trying to think if i have that
09:33 - plug-in available on github
09:37 - i don't think i do
09:44 - um i could probably just grab it from
09:50 - wordpress install we've already worked
09:51 - with
09:52 - um
09:53 - catechetical institute
09:57 - yeah so i'm gonna grab it from
10:00 - catechetics.com
10:30 - okay
10:31 - uh let's find
10:37 - yep this is it this is our project
10:48 - if you see my head bobbing a little bit
10:50 - don't laugh at me i'm listening to some
10:53 - some music that has a really good beat
10:55 - so
10:58 - i just can't help it all right so let me
11:01 - throw this plug in here and let's change
11:04 - this to
11:07 - php
11:09 - so we can get that
11:11 - syntax highlighting wonderful
11:16 - and
11:17 - i definitely need to make this bigger so
11:20 - everyone can see
11:22 - i don't need this right now
11:29 - and
11:31 - oops let me start my timer i'm gonna
11:33 - start this pomodoro timer
11:37 - um
11:54 - harsh is saying try custom posts
11:58 - ui
11:59 - is that a plugin
12:04 - is that a different plugin
12:06 - i was kind of thinking i just use
12:09 - our current plugin
12:11 - that we've already built
12:43 - okay
12:49 - all right so we can just grab
12:53 - basically we can just change
12:55 - [Music]
12:56 - change these
12:58 - for now just the faculty
13:30 - and actually we don't
13:32 - the plural of faculty is faculty
13:38 - i mean we could say faculty member
13:43 - okay
13:45 - so that's all we need for now
13:47 - and then we can get rid of all
13:49 - the rest of this
14:04 - oops i need to keep that it's at the
14:07 - bottom
14:19 - so
14:35 - and
14:36 - why did you do that resource
14:41 - that's weird
14:50 - okay
14:51 - um so it's gonna support obviously a
14:54 - title editor
14:56 - should we have an excerpt
14:59 - yeah i'm gonna have the expert excerpt
15:01 - in there just in case definitely want a
15:03 - thumbnail
15:05 - okay that looks good
15:08 - post slug faculty we definitely want to
15:11 - show in the api showing menu
15:14 - okay
15:15 - that looks good
15:16 - down here with our
15:18 - taxonomies
15:27 - this is
15:29 - do we need this google map api
15:41 - no i don't think we'll need this
15:46 - so let's get rid of this google map
15:50 - api we use this on on
15:53 - that catechetical institute project
16:01 - okay
16:04 - change title of
16:06 - value title for team members
16:13 - all right are we gonna need to do this
16:26 - all right i'm going to
16:27 - comment this out for now
16:30 - because we might need it
16:33 - uh but just not right now
16:35 - so let me explain what this code's doing
16:37 - now that i've kind of cut out the stuff
16:39 - that we don't need
16:40 - and i'm going to comment this for now as
16:42 - well oops did that not
16:47 - yeah i don't think i'm going to do
16:49 - custom taxonomy right now
16:54 - we'll see all right let me explain a
16:56 - little bit and then i'll decide about
16:58 - that so
16:59 - here's what we're doing here we've
17:00 - created a plug-in um a wordpress plugin
17:04 - so we've just given it
17:07 - a name and description you know just
17:09 - some basic stuff here at the top
17:12 - and
17:14 - within this function create new type
17:16 - right we're creating new post types so
17:18 - uh we've created a post type with the
17:20 - name of faculty
17:22 - right and then we've just given it some
17:23 - some options here so
17:26 - um a singular name
17:28 - uh this is the name of for the the add
17:31 - new button so it'll say add new faculty
17:34 - um
17:36 - the edit so basically we're just given
17:37 - the names that all these labels on the
17:39 - post will have
17:41 - right
17:42 - and down here we're registering this
17:45 - type
17:46 - and we're giving it you know some
17:48 - options so
17:50 - we want it to have a title that can be
17:51 - edited and an editor excerpt thumbnail
17:56 - we want it to
17:58 - be shown in the rest api we wanted to
18:00 - show in the menu in the admin panel
18:02 - we've given it a slug of faculty right
18:05 - so
18:08 - it's
18:08 - pretty
18:09 - straightforward you know how this works
18:11 - you definitely need to know what the
18:13 - right you know words are to use
18:16 - uh and then down here you know we're
18:18 - just creating that type so
18:20 - so that's it i mean that's the main
18:21 - point
18:23 - down here though
18:24 - uh
18:25 - you can create custom taxonomies
18:29 - and we may want to do this
18:31 - but first i i just want to make sure
18:33 - that this works and we've done it right
18:36 - and then we'll get to
18:38 - we'll get to these
18:40 - so i'm going to just comment these out
18:41 - for now
18:45 - and then we may come back
18:47 - it might not be a bad idea to make a
18:49 - custom
18:50 - type
18:51 - for the faculty members that says their
18:54 - department oops
18:57 - all right
18:59 - so
19:01 - i'm just going to copy all of this
19:04 - and
19:06 - let's add a new
19:09 - plugin
19:11 - actually maybe i need to
19:14 - see if i can add a new plugin like this
19:17 - yeah i need to upload it first
19:20 - before i can
19:22 - i don't think i can
19:24 - i don't know you appear you're making
19:26 - direct addiction
19:28 - yeah i understand
19:31 - yeah
19:32 - let me make
19:36 - let's save this first
19:42 - um
19:45 - yeah we may as well save it as part of
19:46 - this project
19:56 - so the custom post types.php
20:00 - and then let's go in here
20:15 - all right so we made a zip file for this
20:19 - which is what wordpress wants
20:23 - let's go back to our plugins directory
20:28 - upload this plugin
20:44 - no
20:45 - 158
20:53 - oh man
20:54 - this this little ending
20:58 - piece right there
21:00 - all right let's go
21:07 - uh can we edit this editor
21:23 - all right let's see if this works now
21:30 - i'm 57.
21:32 - i think i commented something out that i
21:34 - should not have
21:36 - all right let's try this one more time
21:51 - so
22:03 - i think that was it
22:08 - no
22:09 - all right
22:10 - um
22:11 - let's see
22:21 - hmm
22:26 - oh no
22:30 - this is a problem
22:32 - okay
22:36 - now i do need that to be closed
22:38 - somewhere i don't think i ever closed it
22:46 - that's close
22:49 - yeah that should be closed
22:58 - hmm
23:02 - i'm gonna check my other version of this
23:04 - plugin
23:08 - yeah i did miss one
23:11 - um
23:14 - here
23:16 - okay
23:19 - oops
23:20 - all right
23:26 - let's edit this
23:28 - one more time this should work
23:40 - yay okay it worked all right so now we
23:42 - have this post type called faculty we
23:44 - can go in and add new faculty
23:47 - right and
23:48 - the info should
23:52 - come in here so
23:54 - this is where where we had imported
23:56 - these posts before that were faculty
23:58 - members now we're going to put it in
23:59 - here
24:00 - so this is all we need for now
24:03 - we're not going to do any custom post
24:04 - types yet
24:06 - just to try to get all this data in here
24:08 - and
24:10 - quickly enough to get the site finished
24:11 - on time
24:13 - if we have time or potentially even
24:15 - after the site launches we can go back
24:17 - in and and make some custom post types
24:21 - it'll clean things up a bit and make it
24:22 - a lot easier to edit later on but for
24:25 - now we're just going to dump everything
24:26 - into this you know kind of wysiwyg
24:29 - editor
24:30 - all right now let me now let me go
24:32 - through
24:37 - we do need
24:44 - hmm
24:48 - we may be able to just put a category in
24:51 - here
24:51 - if i make it so that this supports
24:53 - categories
24:55 - i won't make a custom
24:57 - taxonomy
25:08 - all right let's
25:09 - let's see
25:24 - category
25:25 - how do you spell category what is wrong
25:27 - with me
25:28 - um
25:30 - yeah that's it category
25:34 - there we go
25:36 - all right that should do it
25:41 - the uh process for updating the plugins
25:44 - is not
25:45 - spectacular
25:46 - uh i'm sure there's a better way to set
25:48 - it up but for right now i'm not
25:52 - i shouldn't need to edit this that much
25:57 - okay
25:59 - plugins
26:02 - oops editor
26:20 - all right
26:22 - let's see if we can now put categories
26:24 - in
26:31 - we cannot
26:41 - hmm
26:55 - all right maybe i need to
26:59 - oops
27:02 - all right so it is in there uh so maybe
27:04 - there's
27:06 - that's like
27:09 - i need to look up how how to do that
27:11 - then
27:12 - or make a custom
27:14 - uh taxonomy
27:18 - all right
27:19 - so
27:20 - we also have our um
27:25 - our code that we use to migrate things
27:27 - over
27:29 - so we're gonna use this again we're
27:31 - gonna do it just like we did before
27:37 - let's see
27:41 - yeah just like we did before
27:45 - post data
27:47 - but we are going to need to change
27:50 - some of this so that we're not
27:55 - we don't want this to go to
27:58 - posts we now want it to go to
28:01 - faculty
28:09 - let's see
28:21 - oh you know what i think the um
28:25 - the url was in our
28:28 - config
28:30 - which
28:32 - let me switch off here for a minute
28:35 - so
28:36 - i can't show everyone the config because
28:38 - then you'll see all the passwords and
28:39 - stuff
28:40 - uh so let's
28:48 - let's change this up a bit
29:07 - yeah we'll change this up okay so
29:11 - in our config we were bringing
29:13 - uh like the full url
29:16 - now i do not want to do that anymore
29:21 - we're going to bring
29:26 - let's see
29:44 - all right
29:47 - okay so let me switch back all right so
29:49 - here's what i've changed before uh
29:52 - everything was contained in this wp uri
29:55 - meaning
29:56 - it had the word posts in there so that
29:59 - everything that we were putting through
30:00 - here to be sent to wordpress was was
30:03 - called was being added in as a post
30:08 - we don't want it to be though what we
30:09 - want to see is
30:13 - we don't have the option to make things
30:16 - you know basically whatever whatever we
30:18 - want it to be in this case faculty
30:21 - uh so
30:23 - let's give it
30:24 - i guess we can give it a shot at this
30:26 - point let's see how much time we have
30:28 - six minutes okay
30:31 - and i know i haven't uh checked the live
30:33 - chat in a bit i will as soon as this
30:35 - timer runs out
30:38 - um
30:39 - where are we at
30:46 - i'm just running through to make sure we
30:47 - have everything we need
30:53 - all right we were trying to make the
30:54 - category
30:57 - faculty
30:59 - did we accomplish that last time or not
31:02 - i want to double check
31:05 - see if these posts actually had a
31:07 - category i think we did not i think they
31:10 - ended up
31:11 - not having a category
31:15 - yeah so they came through as
31:16 - uncategorized
31:29 - now before we bring it in we really
31:31 - should
31:33 - get this
31:35 - put in here as as faculty because
31:41 - no not as faculty we want the type of
31:44 - faculty
31:46 - because if we pull too much data in
31:48 - then we'll have to go in and manually
31:49 - add that and i don't i don't really want
31:51 - to do that that's going to take too much
31:53 - time if we figure out how to do this
31:55 - right now then it'll save a lot of time
31:57 - in the long run
31:59 - so
32:02 - let's
32:03 - let's check out
32:07 - what we would have
32:16 - hmm
32:17 - actually i can't check that out now we
32:19 - have no content in the faculty
32:21 - um
32:22 - let's see
32:25 - let's let's put in
32:27 - a
32:31 - create
32:32 - taxonomy
32:35 - you should do it like this
32:37 - now you think
32:45 - yeah i think this is a good way to do it
33:10 - all right so we're gonna make
33:15 - a new taxonomy
33:19 - for
33:20 - the faculty
33:25 - and
33:29 - so you don't want it to be named
33:30 - resource categories
33:35 - um
33:45 - all right
34:31 - okay
34:32 - so
34:33 - we've given these are all the labels
34:35 - that are going to appear in the admin
34:37 - section of wordpress
34:40 - and then here
34:42 - we've
34:43 - we've just added some options
34:46 - uh giving it a slug we want it to show
34:49 - up in the admin menu we want it to show
34:51 - up in
34:51 - uh in our rest api
34:54 - so
34:56 - let's save that
34:58 - copy it over
34:59 - uh into
35:00 - wordpress plugins
35:05 - plugins
35:19 - okay
35:24 - let's see if it worked
35:32 - maybe it's not working
35:34 - because the plug-in is still running
35:38 - oh it's wrong thing
35:44 - let's deactivate that for a second
35:52 - okay less than a minute now i'll go back
35:54 - to the live chat check out what's going
35:56 - on there
36:03 - all right
36:06 - let's go back in here activated see if
36:08 - it's done anything
36:19 - and it has not worked
36:23 - um
36:24 - okay i'm pretty sure i know what i did
36:26 - wrong
36:27 - uh but my time is up
36:30 - uh
36:31 - let's see
36:49 - all right
37:26 - there we go
37:28 - okay so see now we have faculty
37:31 - department
37:32 - uh so
37:36 - philosophy
37:37 - [Music]
37:38 - so we have the faculty department
37:40 - philosophy now so this will work just
37:42 - like categories work
37:44 - on a regular wordpress post but we've
37:46 - now made it custom
37:48 - so all right
37:51 - so that's how you do it uh and this we
37:54 - have enabled the hierarchy which is kind
37:56 - of nice we may or may not use this but
38:00 - uh in case we need to at some point we
38:02 - have it
38:04 - okay great
38:07 - now let's take a five minute break and
38:09 - i'm gonna go back to the live chat looks
38:11 - like there's a lot going on in here so
38:13 - let me
38:14 - scroll up and
38:16 - get through as much as i can
38:37 - okay harsh i see your um
38:40 - you're posting stuff about the custom
38:42 - post type ui thing uh i will check it
38:45 - out
38:55 - um
38:58 - yeah i'll check that out i found
39:03 - i've looked at this one before
39:10 - and to be honest so here's here's the
39:12 - reason why i didn't want to go with a
39:13 - plug-in before
39:14 - one when i can just like copy and paste
39:17 - and do this like quickly
39:19 - it ends up being faster i know it didn't
39:21 - seem that fast before because i had a
39:24 - missing bracket
39:25 - and
39:27 - and i missed that but now that i've
39:28 - gotten through that those are mistakes
39:29 - that i'm not likely to repeat in the
39:32 - near future
39:33 - so it's actually faster for me to just
39:36 - copy and paste these
39:37 - uh whereas if i went with a visual
39:40 - editor i would have to fill out all the
39:42 - fields every time
39:44 - uh so
39:46 - i don't like that also my philosophy
39:48 - when it comes to wordpress plugins are
39:51 - if i can do something efficiently myself
39:55 - then it guarantees that i know for sure
39:58 - what's in that plugin
40:00 - and it's as lean as possible
40:03 - so you know plug in this post type
40:05 - plugin
40:06 - which i'm sure is is very nice and
40:08 - effective it does come with a lot of
40:09 - extra stuff like you know all the stuff
40:12 - that
40:14 - determines what the ui is right and
40:16 - where we were we have no ui uh involved
40:19 - here no admin ui
40:22 - so
40:22 - anyway
40:24 - if doing it this way ends up taking way
40:27 - too long i'll check out that that other
40:29 - plug-in and we are actually going to use
40:31 - a plug-in when we try to make custom
40:32 - fields because
40:35 - the plug-in does save a lot of time
40:39 - but custom post types and taxonomies
40:41 - aren't really that hard to do
40:44 - you know we have the boilerplate right
40:45 - here and we just change the names and
40:49 - that's pretty much it
40:56 - okay
40:58 - you seek
41:00 - thanks explanation
41:14 - okay looks like there is some confusion
41:17 - about what i was writing so this is php
41:20 - and um that's so wordpress is written
41:23 - mostly php
41:25 - so i was making a wordpress plugin
41:28 - that has a category that we can pull our
41:30 - data into so
41:32 - we're not really going to do anything
41:33 - with php for the rest of the
41:35 - rest of the stream
41:37 - this is node
41:38 - so we're going to be mainly working with
41:41 - node and with um sql queries
41:46 - uh for the rest of
41:49 - the stream
41:52 - now i probably won't really show making
41:53 - any more custom post types on a stream
41:55 - uh since i've already demonstrated it
41:58 - once and i know we've done it in
41:59 - previous streams
42:01 - then i think it'll be fine just to for
42:03 - me to do that stuff
42:05 - you know else
42:06 - um
42:08 - different times during the day
42:18 - uh dr dan says the code looks really
42:20 - difficult
42:21 - um
42:22 - yeah honestly if i had to write stuff
42:24 - like that from scratch you know i'm
42:26 - assuming you're talking about the php
42:28 - um then
42:30 - it would be difficult but i mean really
42:32 - when i first made this plug-in
42:35 - all i did was copy what how this was
42:38 - already being done elsewhere
42:40 - i don't remember where i first got this
42:41 - from maybe from the docs i don't know um
42:44 - and then just filled in what i needed
42:47 - right so
42:49 - uh it's not it's not that difficult as
42:51 - long as you you that's why i kind of
42:53 - left this stuff commented out so we have
42:55 - an example that i i don't touch that's
42:57 - not messed up of something that works
43:01 - um if you were talking about this node
43:03 - stuff uh this is somewhat difficult a
43:05 - little bit more advanced heart should
43:07 - actually made this uh so it wasn't me
43:10 - i just modify it you know slightly
43:17 - okay harsh should i see you were saying
43:19 - that i might need to use uh plural in
43:21 - our
43:23 - here instead of category i i could use
43:26 - categories
43:27 - yeah that might have worked i guess it
43:29 - doesn't matter now since we already
43:30 - added that custom
43:32 - the custom i think is
43:34 - the nicer way to go because then it's
43:36 - it's more
43:38 - obvious what is wanted when it's called
43:42 - departments instead of categories
43:45 - uh so
43:47 - it was probably better that i went that
43:48 - way anyway i was just trying to do
43:50 - categories so that it would be a little
43:52 - bit faster
43:58 - uh dr dan asked do we have to use sql
44:00 - prepared statements with node.js is it
44:02 - even possible
44:04 - yeah so
44:07 - let's see
44:08 - oops wrong file um yeah so we're using
44:11 - sqlize which lets us put in just basic
44:15 - sql queries
44:17 - and
44:20 - it basically so that we can use sql
44:23 - queries in node
44:25 - right
44:27 - and these are
44:30 - if the syntax looks weird to you uh we
44:32 - had some issues with the syntax so there
44:35 - are some differences with the syntax
44:37 - between sql server for microsoft and my
44:40 - sql
44:41 - so if if some of these look different
44:43 - it's probably due to that
44:46 - just a difference in syntax
44:50 - all right
44:51 - uh didn't
44:54 - my timer rang but i'm almost to the
44:55 - bottom here the live chat so let me see
44:57 - if i can just get through this last few
44:59 - things here
45:00 - um
45:02 - before we move on let's see
45:06 - street fighter motorcycles says 37
45:08 - watching but only nine likes
45:09 - unacceptable audience members uh
45:12 - yeah i don't
45:15 - i don't think i can even i can't see the
45:16 - likes from the admin panel for the um
45:20 - uh the control room for the live
45:22 - streaming so
45:25 - anyway i'm not really sure what the
45:27 - likes do do their likes play a role in
45:29 - i don't know how you appear like in
45:32 - searches or something i don't i'm not
45:34 - exactly sure i mean it's nice when
45:36 - people like the videos i feel good when
45:37 - it happens but
45:38 - um i'm not sure what role they play in
45:41 - in the overall ranking of videos
45:46 - 13 likes now nice thanks for all the
45:48 - likes
45:52 - dr dan asks if anyone was from america
45:55 - here i know we have a lot of people from
45:56 - america that watch in the stream
45:59 - uh i am from america
46:03 - so people from california colorado
46:05 - georgia texas awesome
46:15 - all right i gotta read this out so this
46:17 - will be probably the last thing that i i
46:19 - read out before we start again
46:21 - with the code
46:25 - um
46:26 - rook said i thought taxonomy was
46:28 - something with dead animals john b says
46:30 - that's taxidermy
46:34 - so
46:37 - that was pretty funny rook i suspect
46:39 - that rook may have known all along
46:43 - it was still pretty funny
46:45 - all right someone from peru welcome
46:50 - well up to 21 likes now awesome
46:54 - someone from poland
46:55 - welcome and portugal
46:57 - all right we have people from all over
46:59 - it i love that uh okay so let's set our
47:03 - timer again do another pomodoro session
47:06 - and this time we're gonna try to
47:11 - bring put our data
47:13 - into the correct post type which is
47:15 - faculty and we're going to try to add
47:17 - this category
47:20 - not a faculty but in this case these are
47:22 - philosophy faculty so we're gonna try to
47:25 - add the word philosophy in here
47:29 - so
47:32 - here's what
47:38 - hmm
47:40 - we're gonna need to see
47:52 - i'm going to need to see how this how
47:54 - this comes in
47:57 - so here actually here's the problem i
48:00 - think
48:11 - all right let's let me um
48:16 - let's do this
48:23 - wp
48:25 - uh what's the
48:27 - camera what the url is
48:30 - vp json
48:34 - me too
48:36 - is that it
48:38 - no restaurant
48:40 - post is it post
48:43 - no
48:44 - um
48:45 - what is it called
48:54 - wpg lwp all right i forgot
48:59 - trying to figure out what the rest route
49:01 - is
49:05 - there we go
49:10 - nothing seriously whoops added extra
49:13 - slash
49:15 - okay
49:16 - um
49:18 - [Music]
49:28 - okay
49:30 - here's the the issue with categories
49:33 - so
49:34 - when you get data from the rest api in
49:36 - the terms of the categories it it's an
49:39 - array but it's an array of the category
49:41 - ids
49:44 - so
49:49 - i'm wondering if we need to
49:52 - create our custom types first
49:55 - get the id
49:56 - and then send the id there uh harshit
50:00 - saying
50:01 - in the live chat check out the api docs
50:03 - for custom post
50:05 - um yeah so let's check that out
50:12 - those types
50:20 - type
50:26 - hmm
50:54 - okay
50:55 - um
50:56 - i really want to see
51:18 - all right so this is that test post that
51:20 - i just made
51:21 - and i want to see
51:23 - okay so faculty department
51:26 - is here
51:29 - and
51:30 - the category
51:32 - philosophy is three
51:36 - all right so let's just grab this this
51:38 - whole thing
51:42 - and put that in here
51:59 - okay so content
52:06 - okay
52:08 - let's try that
52:16 - all right so let's save that
52:19 - and
52:26 - i think that's it and that's all we'll
52:28 - need
52:31 - all right so now this let's run this
52:34 - i still don't know what the
52:38 - shortcut is for
52:42 - the console
52:44 - or the integrated terminal um
52:47 - all right so let's try
52:51 - melissa's
52:53 - migrate yeah
53:01 - uh
53:16 - hmm
53:29 - up someone
53:34 - which i don't like but that's not the
53:37 - end of the world if that's the only
53:39 - thing that's that's being changed
53:44 - there may be other things changing it's
53:46 - hard to read it like this there's a lot
53:48 - of breaks in
53:50 - in the middle let's see if we have those
53:53 - no we don't
53:54 - okay so it is actually adding in a lot
53:56 - of other stuff so we're gonna have to
53:59 - fix that i suppose
54:02 - or at least see how bad it looks
54:07 - if it still looks okay even with these
54:09 - additions then
54:13 - i guess it's fine for now
54:22 - wonderful
54:23 - all right that's great
54:26 - all right let me
54:27 - let me just go back to the live chat
54:29 - briefly to see if i messed anything up
54:31 - that i didn't notice before we try to do
54:33 - more of this
54:38 - well
54:59 - oh no is this
55:02 - is the stream okay now it just occurred
55:04 - to me that
55:06 - maybe it wasn't a good idea to change my
55:09 - network in the middle of a stream
55:12 - so
55:14 - hopefully it's all right uh is
55:18 - oh goodness my the amount of viewers did
55:21 - drop off
55:23 - let me know if you can see the stream
55:28 - the status is saying good in my um
55:34 - control panel
55:38 - but i'm not seeing any activity in the
55:40 - chat
55:45 - so please let me know
55:48 - all right it's okay now great thank you
55:53 - i've been streaming for like seven
55:54 - months and i can't believe like it never
55:56 - occurred to me like hey don't disconnect
55:59 - yourself from the internet while you're
56:00 - streaming uh anyway
56:03 - i had to to change networks because i
56:07 - couldn't access the database otherwise
56:09 - but
56:10 - anyway all right it's fine now sorry
56:12 - about that
56:16 - okay harsh it's saying uh we should use
56:19 - graphql
56:20 - uh
56:24 - our that's that's fine with me
56:27 - i'm
56:29 - i mean since this works i'm not going to
56:31 - um
56:32 - try to switch it up to graphql now but
56:36 - like some point soon if if you think
56:38 - it'll be faster and easier to use
56:41 - graphql to upload this data instead of
56:44 - just a regular rest api then i'm i'm all
56:47 - up for doing that
56:49 - um but let me know like i said we've
56:51 - we've been streaming for about an hour
56:52 - now so i'm not gonna
56:54 - attempt to implement that right now
56:57 - but i'm definitely open to it
57:00 - uh code cvs what's delay on the stream
57:03 - can you read out the time when you read
57:05 - this
57:06 - um
57:07 - [Music]
57:08 - 2
57:10 - 59
57:12 - 2 59 pm eastern time when i'm reading
57:15 - this
57:16 - there's def there's a slight delay
57:18 - i don't know how long the delay is
57:20 - exactly
57:29 - all right uh let's try to bring in let's
57:32 - try to find
57:33 - and then bring in
57:34 - another
57:36 - um
57:37 - department of faculty members
57:41 - so the first thing we need to do is
57:42 - bring over our
57:47 - ours what was this called i always
57:50 - forget what this is called
57:52 - uh
57:53 - sql
57:54 - operations studio for microsoft so this
57:57 - is an electron app from microsoft that
58:00 - is sql operations studio and i think
58:02 - it's pretty cool i like it it looks a
58:04 - lot like visual studio code
58:06 - first things first we need to connect
58:09 - what
58:10 - nice it automatically connected me
58:12 - that's pretty awesome
58:14 - all right and we need to take
58:18 - let's
58:20 - i need a query how do i get the query
58:25 - new connection new server group
58:29 - tables
58:31 - content
58:38 - um
58:52 - i know i had saved
58:56 - queries
58:59 - where did i save that
59:02 - to um
59:04 - [Music]
59:14 - there we go
59:16 - let's try to open that saved query there
59:18 - we go awesome all right let's run that
59:20 - just to make sure it's working no
59:23 - um
59:25 - connect
59:27 - all right cool so that is working
59:30 - uh so let's open up another query then
59:32 - uh and we can just come back in and
59:34 - change the folder id and then this
59:36 - should give us what we need
59:41 - um so what was our select star from
59:49 - content
60:02 - come on
60:06 - all right this is going to take a little
60:07 - bit because i'm accessing everything
60:15 - all right cool so i need to look for
60:19 - something that's obviously
60:23 - let's see
60:29 - a faculty member
60:46 - i'm have to figure out a way to narrow
60:48 - this down a little bit more
60:52 - this is a lot of data
60:57 - all right let me just scroll down
61:01 - area
61:03 - anderson monica
61:08 - for id 146. all right let's check 146.
61:15 - let's run that
61:19 - all right cool so i think this is fine
61:21 - arts department
61:24 - why does nick will have two
61:26 - i don't know let's see which one is the
61:28 - right one
61:29 - um
61:33 - all right this one looks like there's
61:34 - nothing in it i'm i'm not going to try
61:36 - to pull this out right now we'll just
61:38 - delete it since it's only one we'll just
61:39 - delete it from wordpress
61:42 - um but these are fine arts department
61:48 - oh interesting that this shows up in
61:50 - here as well we'll delete that too
61:54 - we definitely don't need that
61:58 - interesting
62:00 - okay
62:05 - all right 146 is what we're bringing in
62:09 - where
62:10 - there we go so now all we have to do is
62:12 - we'll switch it to
62:14 - 146
62:16 - and then let's make this
62:18 - well in wordpress let's make
62:22 - a
62:23 - new
62:25 - add a new faculty department
62:28 - let's go in here we could add them
62:30 - directly
62:32 - so let's name this
62:34 - fine
62:36 - arts
62:39 - and
62:45 - should automatically give us a slug yep
62:47 - fine arts and
62:48 - where is our
62:53 - it's not saying the id
62:57 - i need the id
63:04 - whoa
63:05 - and it's
63:08 - there we go
63:09 - uh let's see if i can make it show the
63:11 - id no
63:14 - uh okay let's
63:17 - uh faculty
63:19 - department let's see if i can
63:22 - get it here
63:30 - there we go
63:31 - so i guess i'll have to just check in
63:33 - the rest api when i add one which is
63:35 - okay
63:36 - uh so it's going to be id4
63:39 - so let's go in here now and change it to
63:41 - id
63:42 - for so
63:44 - when i run
63:47 - when i run this again
63:49 - after making these changes it should
63:51 - pull in all of our fine arts
63:54 - faculty members
63:56 - into our faculty custom post type
63:59 - with the faculty department of fine arts
64:02 - so let's try it out
64:13 - and there we go
64:15 - so now we have fine arts faculty as well
64:18 - and let's get rid of this duplicate
64:21 - which should have nothing let's double
64:22 - check yep it has nothing in there so
64:24 - let's get rid of that duplicate and then
64:26 - let's get rid of that carousel that
64:28 - we're not going to use
64:30 - and we can apply our bulk actions move
64:34 - to trash apply
64:36 - great
64:40 - all right
64:41 - not bad so
64:43 - once we got everything set up all we had
64:45 - to do was run
64:47 - run the commands make a few edits and
64:50 - we've already got all these
64:53 - uh in the system here so you could see
64:55 - how you know after really
64:58 - probably just a a few days work at most
65:02 - we could have you know all of the
65:04 - content really after another hour or two
65:06 - we could probably have all the
65:07 - professors
65:08 - and i'm saying hour or two because you
65:11 - know assuming something messes up
65:15 - but this is going to be much much faster
65:17 - than the alternative which was
65:21 - having
65:23 - um
65:24 - student workers go through and copy and
65:27 - paste content from the website
65:30 - to wordpress
65:32 - that would have taken
65:34 - a really really long time
65:36 - all right cool so about five minutes
65:41 - uh let me go
65:44 - i'll tell you what
65:45 - uh let me go to the live chat
65:48 - i um
65:49 - basically because we went through this
65:50 - process twice already everything
65:53 - beyond this at least for this post type
65:56 - is just going to be the same thing over
65:57 - and over again
65:58 - so there's no need for me to keep doing
66:00 - the same thing right you can always
66:03 - you know rewind a youtube video and
66:05 - watch it again so i don't think there's
66:07 - that much value in doing the same thing
66:09 - again on the live stream
66:11 - so
66:12 - i'm gonna go to the live chat now
66:14 - i'm gonna take any um any questions that
66:17 - you have and read out some of the
66:19 - comments and
66:21 - and then that'll be it for today's
66:22 - stream
66:24 - uh tomorrow i'll try to work on
66:26 - something else uh so
66:30 - we'll see uh let me know right now on
66:32 - the live chat and in the comments if
66:34 - you're watching later if you want to see
66:35 - more of this type of thing of making
66:37 - custom post types and taxonomies
66:39 - bringing over data or if you'd like to
66:41 - move on and get back to some of the
66:43 - react stuff where we're going to build
66:44 - out some of these pages you know now
66:47 - that we have some of this data on the
66:48 - professors we can make
66:50 - uh pages for each department with
66:52 - content and we can also make pages for
66:54 - faculty members so at least we can make
66:56 - that
66:57 - that
66:58 - template page set up the routing for it
67:01 - um so we have some data now we can play
67:04 - with so we can move back to the react
67:05 - stuff if we want
67:07 - but i'd like to know what you all want
67:08 - to see because i have to do it anyway
67:11 - it's just a matter of whether i do it on
67:13 - a stream or not
67:15 - so let me know
67:17 - if i don't hear from anybody i probably
67:18 - am just going to go back to the react
67:20 - stuff
67:22 - i could probably find someone who can
67:24 - run this
67:26 - you know i just say hey watch the video
67:28 - and keep running this script and fill
67:29 - that in
67:30 - so
67:32 - i may not even have to do this by hand
67:34 - but i do need to do the react stuff
67:36 - there's there's not really anyone else
67:38 - that
67:39 - i
67:40 - would be able to just say hey do this
67:42 - because it's not really a repetitive
67:43 - task it's more of um there's going to be
67:46 - some creativity involved
67:48 - alright so let me check
67:50 - in the chat
67:51 - let me scroll up a bit
67:56 - okay so um
67:57 - let's see we have someone from
68:00 - uh as azerbaijan
68:02 - uh welcome
68:05 - also and and they liked as well thank
68:07 - you for the like uh so street fighter
68:10 - says i'm not sure how likes work but
68:12 - it's better to have them than not to
68:14 - have them it's free content that is
68:16 - extremely useful liking is the least we
68:18 - can do i appreciate that thank you for
68:20 - saying that so i mean i did say earlier
68:23 - i'm not sure what the likes are for in
68:24 - terms of you know youtube and what they
68:26 - use it for but
68:27 - um
68:29 - it is nice when i get a lot of likes
68:31 - that does make me feel
68:32 - uh like i'm doing something worthwhile
68:34 - so
68:36 - i do appreciate it
68:40 - uh let's see code cv asks what are you
68:43 - building here um we were building
68:47 - well there's a lot to this project but
68:48 - in this particular stream we were
68:50 - building a wordpress plugin to set up
68:52 - some a custom post type and a custom
68:54 - taxonomy and then we were pulling data
68:57 - from
68:58 - a
68:59 - another database a sql server database
69:02 - and we were pulling it into our
69:04 - wordpress database which is my sequel
69:07 - and
69:10 - so that's what we work on today the
69:12 - bigger picture is that this data is then
69:14 - going to be fed into uh react app
69:18 - and uh eventually there'll be a lot more
69:21 - pieces to it
69:23 - so i do explain some of it in an earlier
69:25 - stream if you want kind of a more
69:26 - in-depth uh explanation
69:29 - so i think maybe like
69:31 - the the beginning like the first video i
69:33 - did for project five
69:35 - uh has a bit a better explanation
69:41 - yeah and again sorry about
69:43 - me messing up the the stream when i
69:45 - switched networks uh just didn't wasn't
69:48 - thinking
69:49 - and i am sorry because the viewer count
69:50 - dropped dramatically so i i think i've
69:53 - lost about at least half of the people
69:55 - that were watching
69:56 - uh so
69:57 - sorry about that uh
69:59 - some of you maybe rejoined after that so
70:02 - really really sorry
70:04 - if anybody that got cut off earlier is
70:06 - watching the recording later on i
70:08 - apologize for that
70:17 - here
70:38 - oh okay uh john boyce said the url said
70:42 - the tag id let me check that out
70:56 - oh cool it does say in the url so the
70:57 - tag id is four all right so i don't have
71:00 - to call the rest api to figure out the
71:02 - tag id that's useful i still wish they
71:04 - would put it somewhere in here but uh i
71:06 - since i can see it in the url then
71:08 - that's uh that's fine too
71:13 - uh thanks john for um for pointing that
71:15 - out that's very useful
71:28 - yeah um harshit yeah your migration
71:31 - scripts are awesome that was that was
71:33 - really good i think i mentioned before
71:35 - like
71:36 - i made like just
71:37 - really really minor adjustments like
71:41 - um
71:43 - obviously like just changing a few
71:44 - things like
71:46 - adding in uh you know custom post type
71:49 - capabilities here i think i
71:53 - i did something like right around here i
71:54 - don't even remember what it was for sure
71:56 - right now but other than that
71:59 - like this is
72:01 - perfect
72:03 - um
72:04 - yeah really good i i really appreciate
72:06 - that
72:12 - hey john hanson's here
72:14 - says hey y'all late
72:16 - uh sorry uh you weren't here earlier
72:19 - just just finishing things up
72:25 - oh cool uh harshit says he's gonna make
72:27 - a pr uh which is a pull request with the
72:30 - graphql setup
72:31 - awesome uh that that'll be really cool
72:34 - yeah
72:35 - i'm interested to see that
72:38 - so i assume i'll have to use the wp
72:41 - graphql plugin with that
72:43 - which is not a problem i i figured we'd
72:45 - we'd install it at some point anyway
72:53 - okay so rook
72:55 - um
72:56 - votes for
72:57 - react for the next stream
73:01 - cool john hanson just react all right
73:03 - code cvs is that database open to the
73:06 - public
73:06 - unfortunately it's not
73:09 - so i only have limited access to this
73:12 - database
73:13 - so i only have
73:15 - read access
73:16 - to a copy of the real database
73:19 - uh and i only have access to it when i'm
73:21 - on campus
73:23 - at this computer
73:25 - on
73:26 - one specific network that i
73:29 - can access from this computer so it's
73:32 - very limited
73:33 - uh i wonder
73:39 - all right my for my database people here
73:42 - is there a way that i could easily make
73:44 - a copy of this database
73:47 - and then have it more widely available
73:51 - assuming that i'm not going to open up
73:53 - info that shouldn't be
73:55 - opened up which i'd have to check to see
73:58 - um maybe like potentially remove
74:03 - some tables or something like that but
74:07 - um
74:10 - maybe that would be better
74:13 - i mean it'd be nice if like let's say i
74:15 - had to work from home one day i could
74:16 - still access this and work on it
74:19 - um
74:24 - yeah anyway so i mean we we're not gonna
74:26 - do it right now we don't need to do
74:27 - right now but if anybody's watching now
74:29 - or later on you watch the recording and
74:31 - you can think of a
74:34 - quick way
74:37 - to
74:40 - duplicate this database
74:43 - i mean it might make things easier
74:50 - yeah i mean i guess i could put it on
74:54 - i don't know where i'd put it
74:56 - i'd have to check into like where where
74:58 - i could host a um
75:01 - a sql server database
75:06 - especially a large sql server database
75:11 - might be a little bit more complicated
75:12 - than i i thought but i think it's worth
75:15 - looking into
75:17 - just
75:19 - you know so it's accessible to more
75:20 - people
75:27 - oh nice
75:30 - okay harsha says maybe hosted and then
75:32 - azure so that's what i was thinking of i
75:35 - do have an account with uh with azure
75:37 - already so
75:38 - um
75:40 - yeah maybe i'll look into that
75:43 - and
75:44 - it looks like car should also found
75:46 - something on stack overflow that i'm
75:47 - checking out right now
76:03 - all right yeah let's check this out
76:19 - interesting
76:23 - all right so there wasn't
76:33 - back up
76:45 - so could i make a backup
76:49 - and then just
76:51 - use that back up somewhere else
77:06 - okay cool
77:08 - um
77:09 - all right maybe i'll look into that i
77:12 - said there's not absolutely a need for
77:14 - that right now it would just be nice to
77:15 - have the option of
77:17 - being able to access this
77:20 - somewhere else
77:27 - all right cool
77:29 - back up too
77:31 - all right that's cool i'm going to leave
77:33 - this up on my screen so i
77:35 - i have it i can remember where i got to
77:37 - this i mean it's not that hard but
77:40 - rather not have to
77:42 - think about it again how i did it all
77:44 - right cool um
77:49 - okay so
77:50 - i've got to the bottom of the live chat
77:52 - here i
77:55 - if i missed your question
77:56 - i'm sorry you can throw it in the live
77:58 - chat right now really quickly if if i
78:00 - see it before i end the stream then i'll
78:02 - i'll answer it
78:04 - otherwise i'm going to wrap things up
78:06 - here
78:07 - so
78:08 - thank you so much for watching thanks
78:10 - for all your help uh definitely
78:12 - accomplish what we uh
78:14 - wanted to accomplish today
78:16 - and
78:18 - it works uh things work like like we
78:21 - thought they would
78:24 - so i should be back tomorrow
78:28 - i think what stays tomorrow
78:31 - yeah tomorrow's good i should be back uh
78:35 - thursday i don't think i'm gonna be able
78:36 - to stream on thursday
78:38 - uh so there's um
78:40 - i have a meeting in the morning and in
78:41 - the afternoon we have a christmas party
78:44 - uh for my my department so
78:48 - not sure if i'll if i'll have time to
78:50 - stream if i can get a short stream in
78:52 - maybe i'll try
78:53 - uh but i guess plan on me not streaming
78:55 - that day
78:57 - i think friday is good though to to uh
78:59 - to stream
79:02 - um
79:03 - okay we did get another question
79:07 - i got two more comments so let me let me
79:08 - read these out so uh
79:11 - bo
79:12 - bogendra
79:13 - uh let me know if i mispronounce that
79:15 - name i'd i'd like to say it correctly uh
79:18 - if i can
79:19 - um but but gender says hi i just knew
79:22 - about it from one of my friends what
79:23 - topics are included in here and what
79:25 - time uh
79:28 - can we on
79:29 - on this live stream thanks so the live
79:31 - stream is usually around 2 pm eastern
79:33 - time monday through friday sometimes
79:36 - i'll go a little earlier a little later
79:38 - but that's you know generally around the
79:40 - time if you subscribe to this channel
79:42 - the free code cam channel you'll get a
79:43 - notification
79:44 - assuming you have your notifications on
79:47 - but you'll get a notification of when i
79:49 - go live i also um
79:51 - tell everyone on
79:54 - twitter before i'm gonna stream
79:57 - uh so
79:58 - my twitter a link to my twitter's in the
80:00 - description of this video so if you'd
80:02 - like to follow me on twitter you'll get
80:04 - an update there as well
80:08 - and the topics are
80:11 - mostly javascript stuff like front-end
80:13 - development we do a lot with react we do
80:16 - some back-end stuff and obviously some
80:18 - database stuff as well a little bit of
80:20 - php uh because we use wordpress for some
80:23 - things
80:25 - we use material design
80:27 - uh a lot
80:30 - i think that covers most of what we do
80:33 - uh so
80:34 - i'm always open to trying new things if
80:36 - there's something you'd really like to
80:37 - see me do i can't guarantee that i'll do
80:39 - it because these are i work on projects
80:42 - that i have to work on for my job so i
80:44 - don't have complete freedom as to what
80:45 - we do but um
80:47 - if i can work in something new
80:49 - you know i definitely try to
80:52 - um anyway thanks for watching
80:55 - uh codetv says you should put more
80:57 - detail about what you're working on in
80:58 - the description yeah and there's a lot
81:01 - more i'd like to do with um
81:03 - the descriptions and the titles that
81:06 - basically the the problem i have with
81:08 - the descriptions are that i write them
81:09 - before i put the stream on and i don't
81:12 - always know what's going to happen
81:13 - during the stream
81:14 - so sometimes the titles and descriptions
81:16 - are are completely different from what
81:19 - we end up doing because whatever i plan
81:21 - to do just doesn't work and we have to
81:22 - switch things up
81:24 - and often i don't go back usually and
81:27 - edit a description unless i see you know
81:30 - like a typo or something
81:32 - uh so
81:35 - i i definitely agree with you
81:38 - it's just it's like it's a time issue
81:40 - for me really uh to go back in and do i
81:43 - know it doesn't seem like a lot but
81:46 - you know at this point i have over 100
81:48 - videos so
81:50 - going back through and trying to make
81:52 - better descriptions uh is going to be
81:54 - pretty difficult and i can't really make
81:57 - great descriptions beforehand as i said
81:59 - because it frequently changes
82:02 - uh so i'd always always be me trying to
82:04 - go back in afterwards
82:08 - i'll think about it and i'll i'll try to
82:10 - do better with the descriptions though
82:11 - so
82:12 - um
82:13 - i think that's good uh it's a good idea
82:16 - and uh i'll see what i can do i can't
82:19 - promise anything but i'll see what i can
82:21 - do
82:23 - oh okay uh harsh it's asking if i
82:25 - checked out the project i have i've been
82:27 - looking at the project
82:29 - um so
82:32 - i um
82:35 - i will give you some feedback i guess
82:37 - har let me know you don't have to
82:39 - let me know in the live chat now you can
82:40 - send me something later uh let me know
82:43 - if there's anything specifically that
82:44 - you would like feedback on
82:47 - um or just like feedback in general as
82:49 - to you know what i see
82:51 - i want to be as helpful as i can to you
82:53 - so if there's if there's some area you
82:55 - really would like feedback on
82:57 - let me know
82:59 - then i can direct you know my attention
83:01 - to that particular area
83:03 - otherwise if you want general feedback
83:05 - that's that's okay too
83:07 - uh i just want to help you out as much
83:09 - as i can
83:12 - okay so i'm that i'm done um
83:15 - with
83:17 - the chat now i am through everything uh
83:19 - for real this time
83:21 - uh so
83:23 - uh again thanks everyone for watching
83:26 - and uh for helping me out here in the
83:28 - live chat i will be back most likely
83:31 - tomorrow
83:33 - and uh in until then have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody uh welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're not gonna do what i said we were going to do yesterday which was try out a new javascript cms and i'll explain why in a minute but what we are going to do is pull out some more data from our sql server database and we're going to use our our node.js code that we that harshit wrote and we're going to put it into my sql database using the wordpress api uh we'll pro we'll need to make some custom post types so we'll be working with a wordpress plugin uh we'll bring over that one that we have used on some some other projects that we made and we'll modify that to fit our our first custom post type we'll make will be um faculty so that's what we'll work on the only other thing that i think we'll need to do is we'll have to do something about the way the html is getting pulled in to wordpress so i'm looking up some things on stack overflow that you all had had mentioned last week at some point so we'll try to get that working but we should be able to get a decent amount of work done today i don't have any meetings so we can have a kind of a normal length stream here so for sure i want to try to get into pomodoro sessions of work with questions in between and after and uh depending on how it's going uh maybe we'll go longer uh we'll see and oh i don't have my headphones my music on let's get that going first uh hey everyone seen the live chat blake's mentioning so i did just get a haircut so anyway um yeah so i feel nice and fresh with my hair cut uh if does anyone use spotify that's watching uh so i guess spotify just came out with um well within the last week sometime the your top songs of 2017 playlist uh so i don't know it's pretty fun i definitely wouldn't want to share it with everybody because i'd be embarrassed i'm somewhat embarrassed by some of the songs that it says that i listen to the most but but it is fun going back through and uh projects i was working on when i was listening to certain songs all the time so that's really fun uh just to remember like oh yeah i listened to that all the time when i was working on you know this website so it did bring back memories uh anyway so if you haven't uh looked that up yet uh check out see if you can find your top songs playlist on your spotify account it's it's a lot of fun all right let's uh jordan asks what cms are you porting from the cms is called ektron and i'm not a big fan of it i haven't had a lot of good experiences using ektron uh and it's old and the company that made it got bought out by another company so i don't really think it has much of a future so we need to to be done with it so let i me really need this right now i don't need that let's see where we're going all right i was working on this earlier but i don't think i need it no we don't need that i shouldn't have anything unsafe so i'm gonna not save that um we don't need any of this none of that none of that we need that sorry i just i was not prepared at all i i ran into one of my former students from when i used to teach high school uh when i was getting a haircut and i talked to her for a while afterwards so it set me back a little bit i didn't get as much time to prepare as i normally do um let's see oh you got um question from all right i know how i was supposed to pronounce this on amhel is that how i pronounce it angel let me know i'm trying to pronounce it i'm trying to remember anyway uh asks what's up with the branch on gatsby uh the brainstorm gatsby i haven't worked on but it's i'm leaving it open and i want to try to work on it um i really wanted to try to work on them both a little bit the next branch and the gatsby branch and then test them out and see which one was faster i still would like to do that but realistically i i've got to be conscious of the amount of time we have to complete this project there's still a lot of work to be done and it needs to be done by february so if if we have to i don't know wait and finish that branch like afterwards then that can be pushed so basically it's something that's not necessary for us to do this project can certainly work and we know it can work with next so i think our best bet is to if we need to for time just work on the branch that is using next and work on the gatsby branch later some other time for testing purposes okay blake's asking about question on the fcc slack channel i don't have the slack channel open right now um maybe i can i can take a look at it later on though uh all right so we will need to log into this uh tell me this password got saved why is it not there we go all right okay great so we brought these posts in last time and uh as you can see they came in like actually did it come in right this time that's interesting whoa all right i don't know if any of y'all just caught that so we were having a problem before where um we brought all this data in and these tags weren't there uh so you could see like root list view image detail view image like you know all these custom tags weren't there and we were getting a different view uh so what i just did was if i go to visual and then i go back then you can see all those tags are gone and they're all switched around but if i just go back out to posts and i come back in here you can see the tags are there again so i think we're okay with that the the i'm assuming what would happen is if i switched to visual edited something and then updated it that we would lose these tags so at least this is good news because at first we can still import data without having to fix that problem of the the tags getting uh getting changed but whenever i open this up and let other people come in and start editing i would have to um i'd have to fix that issue so that's actually good because now we don't have to deal with that on today's stream which i kind of i wanted to to fix that before i even started streaming today but i just ran out of time okay cool so at this point then let's let's build a plugin to make some custom post types and then we'll install that plugin here on our test wordpress install and then we'll pull over some data yeah okay let's do that so the first thing we'll need to do is grab the plugin from a previous project i'm trying to think if i have that plugin available on github i don't think i do um i could probably just grab it from wordpress install we've already worked with um catechetical institute yeah so i'm gonna grab it from catechetics.com okay uh let's find yep this is it this is our project if you see my head bobbing a little bit don't laugh at me i'm listening to some some music that has a really good beat so i just can't help it all right so let me throw this plug in here and let's change this to php so we can get that syntax highlighting wonderful and i definitely need to make this bigger so everyone can see i don't need this right now and oops let me start my timer i'm gonna start this pomodoro timer um harsh is saying try custom posts ui is that a plugin is that a different plugin i was kind of thinking i just use our current plugin that we've already built okay all right so we can just grab basically we can just change change these for now just the faculty and actually we don't the plural of faculty is faculty i mean we could say faculty member okay so that's all we need for now and then we can get rid of all the rest of this oops i need to keep that it's at the bottom so and why did you do that resource that's weird okay um so it's gonna support obviously a title editor should we have an excerpt yeah i'm gonna have the expert excerpt in there just in case definitely want a thumbnail okay that looks good post slug faculty we definitely want to show in the api showing menu okay that looks good down here with our taxonomies this is do we need this google map api no i don't think we'll need this so let's get rid of this google map api we use this on on that catechetical institute project okay change title of value title for team members all right are we gonna need to do this all right i'm going to comment this out for now because we might need it uh but just not right now so let me explain what this code's doing now that i've kind of cut out the stuff that we don't need and i'm going to comment this for now as well oops did that not yeah i don't think i'm going to do custom taxonomy right now we'll see all right let me explain a little bit and then i'll decide about that so here's what we're doing here we've created a plugin um a wordpress plugin so we've just given it a name and description you know just some basic stuff here at the top and within this function create new type right we're creating new post types so uh we've created a post type with the name of faculty right and then we've just given it some some options here so um a singular name uh this is the name of for the the add new button so it'll say add new faculty um the edit so basically we're just given the names that all these labels on the post will have right and down here we're registering this type and we're giving it you know some options so we want it to have a title that can be edited and an editor excerpt thumbnail we want it to be shown in the rest api we wanted to show in the menu in the admin panel we've given it a slug of faculty right so it's pretty straightforward you know how this works you definitely need to know what the right you know words are to use uh and then down here you know we're just creating that type so so that's it i mean that's the main point down here though uh you can create custom taxonomies and we may want to do this but first i i just want to make sure that this works and we've done it right and then we'll get to we'll get to these so i'm going to just comment these out for now and then we may come back it might not be a bad idea to make a custom type for the faculty members that says their department oops all right so i'm just going to copy all of this and let's add a new plugin actually maybe i need to see if i can add a new plugin like this yeah i need to upload it first before i can i don't think i can i don't know you appear you're making direct addiction yeah i understand yeah let me make let's save this first um yeah we may as well save it as part of this project so the custom post types.php and then let's go in here all right so we made a zip file for this which is what wordpress wants let's go back to our plugins directory upload this plugin no 158 oh man this this little ending piece right there all right let's go uh can we edit this editor all right let's see if this works now i'm 57. i think i commented something out that i should not have all right let's try this one more time so i think that was it no all right um let's see hmm oh no this is a problem okay now i do need that to be closed somewhere i don't think i ever closed it that's close yeah that should be closed hmm i'm gonna check my other version of this plugin yeah i did miss one um here okay oops all right let's edit this one more time this should work yay okay it worked all right so now we have this post type called faculty we can go in and add new faculty right and the info should come in here so this is where where we had imported these posts before that were faculty members now we're going to put it in here so this is all we need for now we're not going to do any custom post types yet just to try to get all this data in here and quickly enough to get the site finished on time if we have time or potentially even after the site launches we can go back in and and make some custom post types it'll clean things up a bit and make it a lot easier to edit later on but for now we're just going to dump everything into this you know kind of wysiwyg editor all right now let me now let me go through we do need hmm we may be able to just put a category in here if i make it so that this supports categories i won't make a custom taxonomy all right let's let's see category how do you spell category what is wrong with me um yeah that's it category there we go all right that should do it the uh process for updating the plugins is not spectacular uh i'm sure there's a better way to set it up but for right now i'm not i shouldn't need to edit this that much okay plugins oops editor all right let's see if we can now put categories in we cannot hmm all right maybe i need to oops all right so it is in there uh so maybe there's that's like i need to look up how how to do that then or make a custom uh taxonomy all right so we also have our um our code that we use to migrate things over so we're gonna use this again we're gonna do it just like we did before let's see yeah just like we did before post data but we are going to need to change some of this so that we're not we don't want this to go to posts we now want it to go to faculty let's see oh you know what i think the um the url was in our config which let me switch off here for a minute so i can't show everyone the config because then you'll see all the passwords and stuff uh so let's let's change this up a bit yeah we'll change this up okay so in our config we were bringing uh like the full url now i do not want to do that anymore we're going to bring let's see all right okay so let me switch back all right so here's what i've changed before uh everything was contained in this wp uri meaning it had the word posts in there so that everything that we were putting through here to be sent to wordpress was was called was being added in as a post we don't want it to be though what we want to see is we don't have the option to make things you know basically whatever whatever we want it to be in this case faculty uh so let's give it i guess we can give it a shot at this point let's see how much time we have six minutes okay and i know i haven't uh checked the live chat in a bit i will as soon as this timer runs out um where are we at i'm just running through to make sure we have everything we need all right we were trying to make the category faculty did we accomplish that last time or not i want to double check see if these posts actually had a category i think we did not i think they ended up not having a category yeah so they came through as uncategorized now before we bring it in we really should get this put in here as as faculty because no not as faculty we want the type of faculty because if we pull too much data in then we'll have to go in and manually add that and i don't i don't really want to do that that's going to take too much time if we figure out how to do this right now then it'll save a lot of time in the long run so let's let's check out what we would have hmm actually i can't check that out now we have no content in the faculty um let's see let's let's put in a create taxonomy you should do it like this now you think yeah i think this is a good way to do it all right so we're gonna make a new taxonomy for the faculty and so you don't want it to be named resource categories um all right okay so we've given these are all the labels that are going to appear in the admin section of wordpress and then here we've we've just added some options uh giving it a slug we want it to show up in the admin menu we want it to show up in uh in our rest api so let's save that copy it over uh into wordpress plugins plugins okay let's see if it worked maybe it's not working because the plugin is still running oh it's wrong thing let's deactivate that for a second okay less than a minute now i'll go back to the live chat check out what's going on there all right let's go back in here activated see if it's done anything and it has not worked um okay i'm pretty sure i know what i did wrong uh but my time is up uh let's see all right there we go okay so see now we have faculty department uh so philosophy so we have the faculty department philosophy now so this will work just like categories work on a regular wordpress post but we've now made it custom so all right so that's how you do it uh and this we have enabled the hierarchy which is kind of nice we may or may not use this but uh in case we need to at some point we have it okay great now let's take a five minute break and i'm gonna go back to the live chat looks like there's a lot going on in here so let me scroll up and get through as much as i can okay harsh i see your um you're posting stuff about the custom post type ui thing uh i will check it out um yeah i'll check that out i found i've looked at this one before and to be honest so here's here's the reason why i didn't want to go with a plugin before one when i can just like copy and paste and do this like quickly it ends up being faster i know it didn't seem that fast before because i had a missing bracket and and i missed that but now that i've gotten through that those are mistakes that i'm not likely to repeat in the near future so it's actually faster for me to just copy and paste these uh whereas if i went with a visual editor i would have to fill out all the fields every time uh so i don't like that also my philosophy when it comes to wordpress plugins are if i can do something efficiently myself then it guarantees that i know for sure what's in that plugin and it's as lean as possible so you know plug in this post type plugin which i'm sure is is very nice and effective it does come with a lot of extra stuff like you know all the stuff that determines what the ui is right and where we were we have no ui uh involved here no admin ui so anyway if doing it this way ends up taking way too long i'll check out that that other plugin and we are actually going to use a plugin when we try to make custom fields because the plugin does save a lot of time but custom post types and taxonomies aren't really that hard to do you know we have the boilerplate right here and we just change the names and that's pretty much it okay you seek thanks explanation okay looks like there is some confusion about what i was writing so this is php and um that's so wordpress is written mostly php so i was making a wordpress plugin that has a category that we can pull our data into so we're not really going to do anything with php for the rest of the rest of the stream this is node so we're going to be mainly working with node and with um sql queries uh for the rest of the stream now i probably won't really show making any more custom post types on a stream uh since i've already demonstrated it once and i know we've done it in previous streams then i think it'll be fine just to for me to do that stuff you know else um different times during the day uh dr dan says the code looks really difficult um yeah honestly if i had to write stuff like that from scratch you know i'm assuming you're talking about the php um then it would be difficult but i mean really when i first made this plugin all i did was copy what how this was already being done elsewhere i don't remember where i first got this from maybe from the docs i don't know um and then just filled in what i needed right so uh it's not it's not that difficult as long as you you that's why i kind of left this stuff commented out so we have an example that i i don't touch that's not messed up of something that works um if you were talking about this node stuff uh this is somewhat difficult a little bit more advanced heart should actually made this uh so it wasn't me i just modify it you know slightly okay harsh should i see you were saying that i might need to use uh plural in our here instead of category i i could use categories yeah that might have worked i guess it doesn't matter now since we already added that custom the custom i think is the nicer way to go because then it's it's more obvious what is wanted when it's called departments instead of categories uh so it was probably better that i went that way anyway i was just trying to do categories so that it would be a little bit faster uh dr dan asked do we have to use sql prepared statements with node.js is it even possible yeah so let's see oops wrong file um yeah so we're using sqlize which lets us put in just basic sql queries and it basically so that we can use sql queries in node right and these are if the syntax looks weird to you uh we had some issues with the syntax so there are some differences with the syntax between sql server for microsoft and my sql so if if some of these look different it's probably due to that just a difference in syntax all right uh didn't my timer rang but i'm almost to the bottom here the live chat so let me see if i can just get through this last few things here um before we move on let's see street fighter motorcycles says 37 watching but only nine likes unacceptable audience members uh yeah i don't i don't think i can even i can't see the likes from the admin panel for the um uh the control room for the live streaming so anyway i'm not really sure what the likes do do their likes play a role in i don't know how you appear like in searches or something i don't i'm not exactly sure i mean it's nice when people like the videos i feel good when it happens but um i'm not sure what role they play in in the overall ranking of videos 13 likes now nice thanks for all the likes dr dan asks if anyone was from america here i know we have a lot of people from america that watch in the stream uh i am from america so people from california colorado georgia texas awesome all right i gotta read this out so this will be probably the last thing that i i read out before we start again with the code um rook said i thought taxonomy was something with dead animals john b says that's taxidermy so that was pretty funny rook i suspect that rook may have known all along it was still pretty funny all right someone from peru welcome well up to 21 likes now awesome someone from poland welcome and portugal all right we have people from all over it i love that uh okay so let's set our timer again do another pomodoro session and this time we're gonna try to bring put our data into the correct post type which is faculty and we're going to try to add this category not a faculty but in this case these are philosophy faculty so we're gonna try to add the word philosophy in here so here's what hmm we're gonna need to see i'm going to need to see how this how this comes in so here actually here's the problem i think all right let's let me um let's do this wp uh what's the camera what the url is vp json me too is that it no restaurant post is it post no um what is it called wpg lwp all right i forgot trying to figure out what the rest route is there we go nothing seriously whoops added extra slash okay um okay here's the the issue with categories so when you get data from the rest api in the terms of the categories it it's an array but it's an array of the category ids so i'm wondering if we need to create our custom types first get the id and then send the id there uh harshit saying in the live chat check out the api docs for custom post um yeah so let's check that out those types type hmm okay um i really want to see all right so this is that test post that i just made and i want to see okay so faculty department is here and the category philosophy is three all right so let's just grab this this whole thing and put that in here okay so content okay let's try that all right so let's save that and i think that's it and that's all we'll need all right so now this let's run this i still don't know what the shortcut is for the console or the integrated terminal um all right so let's try melissa's migrate yeah uh hmm up someone which i don't like but that's not the end of the world if that's the only thing that's that's being changed there may be other things changing it's hard to read it like this there's a lot of breaks in in the middle let's see if we have those no we don't okay so it is actually adding in a lot of other stuff so we're gonna have to fix that i suppose or at least see how bad it looks if it still looks okay even with these additions then i guess it's fine for now wonderful all right that's great all right let me let me just go back to the live chat briefly to see if i messed anything up that i didn't notice before we try to do more of this well oh no is this is the stream okay now it just occurred to me that maybe it wasn't a good idea to change my network in the middle of a stream so hopefully it's all right uh is oh goodness my the amount of viewers did drop off let me know if you can see the stream the status is saying good in my um control panel but i'm not seeing any activity in the chat so please let me know all right it's okay now great thank you i've been streaming for like seven months and i can't believe like it never occurred to me like hey don't disconnect yourself from the internet while you're streaming uh anyway i had to to change networks because i couldn't access the database otherwise but anyway all right it's fine now sorry about that okay harsh it's saying uh we should use graphql uh our that's that's fine with me i'm i mean since this works i'm not going to um try to switch it up to graphql now but like some point soon if if you think it'll be faster and easier to use graphql to upload this data instead of just a regular rest api then i'm i'm all up for doing that um but let me know like i said we've we've been streaming for about an hour now so i'm not gonna attempt to implement that right now but i'm definitely open to it uh code cvs what's delay on the stream can you read out the time when you read this um 2 59 2 59 pm eastern time when i'm reading this there's def there's a slight delay i don't know how long the delay is exactly all right uh let's try to bring in let's try to find and then bring in another um department of faculty members so the first thing we need to do is bring over our ours what was this called i always forget what this is called uh sql operations studio for microsoft so this is an electron app from microsoft that is sql operations studio and i think it's pretty cool i like it it looks a lot like visual studio code first things first we need to connect what nice it automatically connected me that's pretty awesome all right and we need to take let's i need a query how do i get the query new connection new server group tables content um i know i had saved queries where did i save that to um there we go let's try to open that saved query there we go awesome all right let's run that just to make sure it's working no um connect all right cool so that is working uh so let's open up another query then uh and we can just come back in and change the folder id and then this should give us what we need um so what was our select star from content come on all right this is going to take a little bit because i'm accessing everything all right cool so i need to look for something that's obviously let's see a faculty member i'm have to figure out a way to narrow this down a little bit more this is a lot of data all right let me just scroll down area anderson monica for id 146. all right let's check 146. let's run that all right cool so i think this is fine arts department why does nick will have two i don't know let's see which one is the right one um all right this one looks like there's nothing in it i'm i'm not going to try to pull this out right now we'll just delete it since it's only one we'll just delete it from wordpress um but these are fine arts department oh interesting that this shows up in here as well we'll delete that too we definitely don't need that interesting okay all right 146 is what we're bringing in where there we go so now all we have to do is we'll switch it to 146 and then let's make this well in wordpress let's make a new add a new faculty department let's go in here we could add them directly so let's name this fine arts and should automatically give us a slug yep fine arts and where is our it's not saying the id i need the id whoa and it's there we go uh let's see if i can make it show the id no uh okay let's uh faculty department let's see if i can get it here there we go so i guess i'll have to just check in the rest api when i add one which is okay uh so it's going to be id4 so let's go in here now and change it to id for so when i run when i run this again after making these changes it should pull in all of our fine arts faculty members into our faculty custom post type with the faculty department of fine arts so let's try it out and there we go so now we have fine arts faculty as well and let's get rid of this duplicate which should have nothing let's double check yep it has nothing in there so let's get rid of that duplicate and then let's get rid of that carousel that we're not going to use and we can apply our bulk actions move to trash apply great all right not bad so once we got everything set up all we had to do was run run the commands make a few edits and we've already got all these uh in the system here so you could see how you know after really probably just a a few days work at most we could have you know all of the content really after another hour or two we could probably have all the professors and i'm saying hour or two because you know assuming something messes up but this is going to be much much faster than the alternative which was having um student workers go through and copy and paste content from the website to wordpress that would have taken a really really long time all right cool so about five minutes uh let me go i'll tell you what uh let me go to the live chat i um basically because we went through this process twice already everything beyond this at least for this post type is just going to be the same thing over and over again so there's no need for me to keep doing the same thing right you can always you know rewind a youtube video and watch it again so i don't think there's that much value in doing the same thing again on the live stream so i'm gonna go to the live chat now i'm gonna take any um any questions that you have and read out some of the comments and and then that'll be it for today's stream uh tomorrow i'll try to work on something else uh so we'll see uh let me know right now on the live chat and in the comments if you're watching later if you want to see more of this type of thing of making custom post types and taxonomies bringing over data or if you'd like to move on and get back to some of the react stuff where we're going to build out some of these pages you know now that we have some of this data on the professors we can make uh pages for each department with content and we can also make pages for faculty members so at least we can make that that template page set up the routing for it um so we have some data now we can play with so we can move back to the react stuff if we want but i'd like to know what you all want to see because i have to do it anyway it's just a matter of whether i do it on a stream or not so let me know if i don't hear from anybody i probably am just going to go back to the react stuff i could probably find someone who can run this you know i just say hey watch the video and keep running this script and fill that in so i may not even have to do this by hand but i do need to do the react stuff there's there's not really anyone else that i would be able to just say hey do this because it's not really a repetitive task it's more of um there's going to be some creativity involved alright so let me check in the chat let me scroll up a bit okay so um let's see we have someone from uh as azerbaijan uh welcome also and and they liked as well thank you for the like uh so street fighter says i'm not sure how likes work but it's better to have them than not to have them it's free content that is extremely useful liking is the least we can do i appreciate that thank you for saying that so i mean i did say earlier i'm not sure what the likes are for in terms of you know youtube and what they use it for but um it is nice when i get a lot of likes that does make me feel uh like i'm doing something worthwhile so i do appreciate it uh let's see code cv asks what are you building here um we were building well there's a lot to this project but in this particular stream we were building a wordpress plugin to set up some a custom post type and a custom taxonomy and then we were pulling data from a another database a sql server database and we were pulling it into our wordpress database which is my sequel and so that's what we work on today the bigger picture is that this data is then going to be fed into uh react app and uh eventually there'll be a lot more pieces to it so i do explain some of it in an earlier stream if you want kind of a more indepth uh explanation so i think maybe like the the beginning like the first video i did for project five uh has a bit a better explanation yeah and again sorry about me messing up the the stream when i switched networks uh just didn't wasn't thinking and i am sorry because the viewer count dropped dramatically so i i think i've lost about at least half of the people that were watching uh so sorry about that uh some of you maybe rejoined after that so really really sorry if anybody that got cut off earlier is watching the recording later on i apologize for that here oh okay uh john boyce said the url said the tag id let me check that out oh cool it does say in the url so the tag id is four all right so i don't have to call the rest api to figure out the tag id that's useful i still wish they would put it somewhere in here but uh i since i can see it in the url then that's uh that's fine too uh thanks john for um for pointing that out that's very useful yeah um harshit yeah your migration scripts are awesome that was that was really good i think i mentioned before like i made like just really really minor adjustments like um obviously like just changing a few things like adding in uh you know custom post type capabilities here i think i i did something like right around here i don't even remember what it was for sure right now but other than that like this is perfect um yeah really good i i really appreciate that hey john hanson's here says hey y'all late uh sorry uh you weren't here earlier just just finishing things up oh cool uh harshit says he's gonna make a pr uh which is a pull request with the graphql setup awesome uh that that'll be really cool yeah i'm interested to see that so i assume i'll have to use the wp graphql plugin with that which is not a problem i i figured we'd we'd install it at some point anyway okay so rook um votes for react for the next stream cool john hanson just react all right code cvs is that database open to the public unfortunately it's not so i only have limited access to this database so i only have read access to a copy of the real database uh and i only have access to it when i'm on campus at this computer on one specific network that i can access from this computer so it's very limited uh i wonder all right my for my database people here is there a way that i could easily make a copy of this database and then have it more widely available assuming that i'm not going to open up info that shouldn't be opened up which i'd have to check to see um maybe like potentially remove some tables or something like that but um maybe that would be better i mean it'd be nice if like let's say i had to work from home one day i could still access this and work on it um yeah anyway so i mean we we're not gonna do it right now we don't need to do right now but if anybody's watching now or later on you watch the recording and you can think of a quick way to duplicate this database i mean it might make things easier yeah i mean i guess i could put it on i don't know where i'd put it i'd have to check into like where where i could host a um a sql server database especially a large sql server database might be a little bit more complicated than i i thought but i think it's worth looking into just you know so it's accessible to more people oh nice okay harsha says maybe hosted and then azure so that's what i was thinking of i do have an account with uh with azure already so um yeah maybe i'll look into that and it looks like car should also found something on stack overflow that i'm checking out right now all right yeah let's check this out interesting all right so there wasn't back up so could i make a backup and then just use that back up somewhere else okay cool um all right maybe i'll look into that i said there's not absolutely a need for that right now it would just be nice to have the option of being able to access this somewhere else all right cool back up too all right that's cool i'm going to leave this up on my screen so i i have it i can remember where i got to this i mean it's not that hard but rather not have to think about it again how i did it all right cool um okay so i've got to the bottom of the live chat here i if i missed your question i'm sorry you can throw it in the live chat right now really quickly if if i see it before i end the stream then i'll i'll answer it otherwise i'm going to wrap things up here so thank you so much for watching thanks for all your help uh definitely accomplish what we uh wanted to accomplish today and it works uh things work like like we thought they would so i should be back tomorrow i think what stays tomorrow yeah tomorrow's good i should be back uh thursday i don't think i'm gonna be able to stream on thursday uh so there's um i have a meeting in the morning and in the afternoon we have a christmas party uh for my my department so not sure if i'll if i'll have time to stream if i can get a short stream in maybe i'll try uh but i guess plan on me not streaming that day i think friday is good though to to uh to stream um okay we did get another question i got two more comments so let me let me read these out so uh bo bogendra uh let me know if i mispronounce that name i'd i'd like to say it correctly uh if i can um but but gender says hi i just knew about it from one of my friends what topics are included in here and what time uh can we on on this live stream thanks so the live stream is usually around 2 pm eastern time monday through friday sometimes i'll go a little earlier a little later but that's you know generally around the time if you subscribe to this channel the free code cam channel you'll get a notification assuming you have your notifications on but you'll get a notification of when i go live i also um tell everyone on twitter before i'm gonna stream uh so my twitter a link to my twitter's in the description of this video so if you'd like to follow me on twitter you'll get an update there as well and the topics are mostly javascript stuff like frontend development we do a lot with react we do some backend stuff and obviously some database stuff as well a little bit of php uh because we use wordpress for some things we use material design uh a lot i think that covers most of what we do uh so i'm always open to trying new things if there's something you'd really like to see me do i can't guarantee that i'll do it because these are i work on projects that i have to work on for my job so i don't have complete freedom as to what we do but um if i can work in something new you know i definitely try to um anyway thanks for watching uh codetv says you should put more detail about what you're working on in the description yeah and there's a lot more i'd like to do with um the descriptions and the titles that basically the the problem i have with the descriptions are that i write them before i put the stream on and i don't always know what's going to happen during the stream so sometimes the titles and descriptions are are completely different from what we end up doing because whatever i plan to do just doesn't work and we have to switch things up and often i don't go back usually and edit a description unless i see you know like a typo or something uh so i i definitely agree with you it's just it's like it's a time issue for me really uh to go back in and do i know it doesn't seem like a lot but you know at this point i have over 100 videos so going back through and trying to make better descriptions uh is going to be pretty difficult and i can't really make great descriptions beforehand as i said because it frequently changes uh so i'd always always be me trying to go back in afterwards i'll think about it and i'll i'll try to do better with the descriptions though so um i think that's good uh it's a good idea and uh i'll see what i can do i can't promise anything but i'll see what i can do oh okay uh harsh it's asking if i checked out the project i have i've been looking at the project um so i um i will give you some feedback i guess har let me know you don't have to let me know in the live chat now you can send me something later uh let me know if there's anything specifically that you would like feedback on um or just like feedback in general as to you know what i see i want to be as helpful as i can to you so if there's if there's some area you really would like feedback on let me know then i can direct you know my attention to that particular area otherwise if you want general feedback that's that's okay too uh i just want to help you out as much as i can okay so i'm that i'm done um with the chat now i am through everything uh for real this time uh so uh again thanks everyone for watching and uh for helping me out here in the live chat i will be back most likely tomorrow and uh in until then have a great day
