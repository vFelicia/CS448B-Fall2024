00:00 - good morning my name is colleen this is
00:02 - a day in the life of a freelance
00:04 - software engineer my day starts at about
00:06 - 6 30 when my kids wake me up i am here
00:10 - with them having some breakfast do you
00:11 - want to say hi hi
00:14 - do you want to say hi
00:20 - i will check back in with you when my
00:21 - work day starts so my work day starts at
00:23 - 8 a.m when my babysitter arrives i have
00:26 - three kids one in full day school one in
00:28 - half day nursery school and one that is
00:30 - still home
00:31 - so juggling all of that can be a little
00:34 - bit challenging when i first started out
00:36 - i was not making enough money to hire a
00:37 - babysitter
00:39 - and so i was hustling to get work done
00:41 - late into the night early in the morning
00:43 - and during nap time having the freedom
00:45 - to have her here has really made a
00:47 - difference
00:48 - now that i have a good clientele and i'm
00:50 - making money she has been a tremendous
00:52 - help i am not one of those people that
00:55 - can work with my kids running around i
00:57 - like quiet i like intense focus with
00:59 - what i do so that has really added to my
01:02 - productivity
01:04 - i have three kids in a three bedroom
01:05 - house so
01:07 - my office is in my master bedroom
01:11 - i have a new macbook pro here that i
01:14 - work and a 27 inch monitor
01:18 - it's kind of hard to appreciate how big
01:20 - that is on this video but it's amazing i
01:23 - love it i thought about going to
01:25 - co-working space so i could meet more
01:26 - people
01:28 - but i love my monitor and i think i
01:30 - would miss it too much
01:32 - um one of the things about freelancing
01:34 - is there's a lot more overhead than you
01:35 - would think
01:37 - you think hey i'm going to build 40
01:39 - hours a week at 100 an hour i'm gonna be
01:41 - rich
01:42 - but the reality is
01:44 - you're not going to build 40 hours in a
01:45 - week unless you're working 60. at least
01:47 - that's been my experience so far there's
01:50 - a lot of overhead especially as you're
01:51 - ramping up i've been doing this for
01:52 - about a year so although i have a pretty
01:55 - good backlog right now
01:57 - i probably keep about a three month
01:59 - backlog of work so i'm always looking
02:01 - for new clients
02:03 - and i'm always managing those clients
02:06 - that's the other thing because i have so
02:08 - many clients
02:10 - managing them actually takes a little
02:12 - bit of my time so this morning i'm going
02:14 - to start with checking my email
02:16 - and i have a new client who has sent me
02:18 - a contract so i have to read the
02:19 - contract and sign the contract and that
02:22 - client has also sent me their github
02:23 - repo so i have to look at the code and
02:26 - see what kind of issues i need to fix
02:28 - i've noticed
02:30 - or one of the things about being a
02:31 - freelancer is you switch
02:33 - code bases quite often and there's
02:36 - always a ramp up time when you're
02:38 - learning a new code base trying to
02:39 - identify the issues that you have been
02:41 - hired to solve one of the really cool
02:43 - things about this is i see a lot of
02:45 - different styles i see a lot of
02:47 - different gems
02:48 - used for different things
02:50 - but one of the kind of frustrating
02:52 - things is it can slow you down a little
02:53 - bit because you do need that ramp up
02:55 - period for a new
02:56 - code base
02:58 - so i'll start my day looking at that
03:00 - contract checking my email getting that
03:02 - signed
03:03 - then i'm going to have to go
03:06 - into
03:07 - my time tracking tool i use harvest
03:10 - there's a lot of good ones out there but
03:11 - i've been using harvest i've been happy
03:13 - with it it provides time tracking and
03:15 - invoicing and i will have to add this
03:17 - new client and i will have to start
03:19 - billing hours
03:20 - the thing you have to be very very
03:22 - specific on when you are a freelancer is
03:25 - your hours so you have to be very
03:26 - diligent in building the correct hours
03:28 - to the correct client and so i think
03:31 - having a time tracking tool it works way
03:33 - better than trying to use excel in a
03:34 - timer or something like that
03:45 - so i signed the contract i told you i
03:47 - was going to look at and i just cloned
03:49 - the new repo i'm going to be working on
03:52 - while that was cloning i hopped on to
03:54 - slack to check in with
03:56 - my slack teams one of the organizations
03:59 - i work for is a contract basis so i get
04:01 - a little bit of work from them every
04:03 - week and we use slack to communicate i
04:06 - try not to keep slack on all day because
04:08 - it can be distracting
04:10 - so i clone the repo and i am having
04:13 - problems i can't even open the code yet
04:15 - that's always really frustrating a lot
04:17 - of times you'll see that sometimes they
04:19 - all use different versions um of ruby
04:21 - and rails i use arbemv arbenv to manage
04:25 - my version so it's actually not a
04:27 - problem but i just it does you know it
04:30 - is a little thing you got to go you got
04:31 - to figure out what they're using why
04:32 - isn't my gem file working that kind of
04:34 - stuff so that's what i'm doing right now
04:36 - um like i said i check in on slack and
04:39 - everything is good there are no updates
04:41 - for me with one company i contract with
04:43 - i get paid when my pull request is
04:45 - merged so i like to hop onto github to
04:48 - see if there are any comments on my pull
04:49 - request and see what status
04:52 - that is in and then i sometimes use the
04:55 - pomodoro technique to focus depending on
04:57 - what i'm doing which is 25 minutes of
04:59 - intense focus five minute break
05:02 - so i think i'm not going to start that
05:04 - until i can get uh the repo working
05:07 - properly and once i get that and i'm
05:08 - really diving into the code i'll start
05:10 - my pomodoro pomodoro pomodoro what do
05:13 - you say has
05:15 - pomodoro pomodoro timer it's about 12
05:17 - o'clock i spent the morning getting set
05:20 - up with the new code base that i'm gonna
05:22 - be start i'm going to start working on
05:24 - this week and also taking on some other
05:27 - issues for one of my contract clients if
05:29 - you're wondering why i'm laying on the
05:30 - floor it's because i use the pomodoro
05:32 - technique which is 25 minutes on five
05:35 - minutes off so for those 25 minutes i
05:37 - turn off my email i turn off my slack
05:39 - and i try to focus for my five minutes
05:41 - off i do some yoga
05:43 - and i do 10 push-ups um and then if i
05:46 - have time left over i do some laundry so
05:49 - i'm gonna get back to work and i will
05:51 - check in with you around lunchtime
06:01 - good afternoon it's about one o'clock so
06:03 - it's lunch time
06:05 - one of the things about having my
06:06 - toddler in my house while i'm trying to
06:08 - work is i have to stay out of sight
06:11 - while she is down here so i sneak down
06:13 - here
06:14 - during nap time and get my lunch
06:18 - i don't know about you but one of the
06:21 - problems i always had working from home
06:23 - is i wouldn't make lunch and then i'd
06:25 - get hungry and then i was too lazy to
06:28 - make lunch so i would just eat
06:30 - chips and salsa but i've started making
06:33 - these mason jar salads doesn't that look
06:35 - delicious
06:36 - and i eat them because they are super
06:38 - convenient so i just dump this in a bowl
06:40 - and i can eat it all right i don't
06:43 - really break for lunch because
06:46 - time is money and as long as i'm paying
06:48 - my babysitter i want to be working so
06:50 - i'll probably i'll grab my beautiful
06:52 - salad
06:52 - dump it in a bowl and i will take it
06:54 - back to my little cave slash office
07:02 - it's about three o'clock and my
07:03 - babysitter just left and i got my little
07:05 - one here up from her nap
07:07 - next we are going to pick up my eldest
07:12 - son from school and then hopefully we'll
07:14 - have some fun outside and get to enjoy
07:17 - the day a little bit
07:18 - um and
07:20 - uh probably
07:22 - check back in later
07:24 - one of the biggest benefits of being a
07:26 - freelancer is having flexibility over my
07:28 - own schedule so as i mentioned i worked
07:30 - eight to three today it's about 4 30 and
07:33 - i brought my kids to the beautiful
07:35 - norfolk botanical gardens
07:37 - and they are playing on the world's
07:40 - biggest
07:41 - sand pile can i tell them something
07:44 - hi
07:45 - my name is declan
07:47 - i'm digging for a treasure that has
07:49 - candy inside
07:52 - i'm back at my desk it's 7 30 at night
07:56 - i just put the kids to bed
07:58 - and um there's a lot of work i have to
08:00 - get done i'm traveling the second half
08:02 - of this week for a conference which is
08:03 - awesome but being a freelancer i build
08:06 - hourly so if i'm not working i'm not
08:08 - getting paid that means i have to put in
08:10 - some hours in the evenings
08:12 - to make up for the time i'm gonna lose
08:14 - also it's not as consistent as i used to
08:17 - think i thought being a freelancer meant
08:19 - i could just take time off whenever i
08:21 - wanted
08:22 - but the reality is you have a lot of
08:23 - clients that you work with continuously
08:25 - and it's important to meet their
08:27 - deadlines and make sure you don't let
08:29 - them down in order to keep their
08:30 - business
08:31 - so i will probably work here till
08:34 - i don't know 9 30 or so and then i'll go
08:36 - to bed
08:37 - thanks for watching bye

Cleaned transcript:

good morning my name is colleen this is a day in the life of a freelance software engineer my day starts at about 6 30 when my kids wake me up i am here with them having some breakfast do you want to say hi hi do you want to say hi i will check back in with you when my work day starts so my work day starts at 8 a.m when my babysitter arrives i have three kids one in full day school one in half day nursery school and one that is still home so juggling all of that can be a little bit challenging when i first started out i was not making enough money to hire a babysitter and so i was hustling to get work done late into the night early in the morning and during nap time having the freedom to have her here has really made a difference now that i have a good clientele and i'm making money she has been a tremendous help i am not one of those people that can work with my kids running around i like quiet i like intense focus with what i do so that has really added to my productivity i have three kids in a three bedroom house so my office is in my master bedroom i have a new macbook pro here that i work and a 27 inch monitor it's kind of hard to appreciate how big that is on this video

there's a lot more overhead than you would think you think hey i'm going to build 40 hours a week at 100 an hour i'm gonna be rich but the reality is you're not going to build 40 hours in a week
