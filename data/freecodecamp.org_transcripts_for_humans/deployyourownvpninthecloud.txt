00:00 - thank you everyone for coming my name is
00:01 - robert axelsson
00:03 - besides from organizing this meetup i'm
00:05 - also going to give a talk uh to you
00:07 - today
00:08 - on the topic on the topic of deploying a
00:10 - vpn
00:12 - a vpn is a virtual private network that
00:14 - enables it for you to
00:16 - connect
00:18 - to that server or that network from your
00:21 - connection when you are connected to the
00:23 - internet
00:24 - and it gives room for you to encrypt
00:26 - your data
00:27 - and also to
00:29 - bypass as a proxy if your server vpn
00:31 - network is in
00:33 - the us it will appear
00:35 - most probably for the person that you
00:38 - are
00:39 - accessing the website at for example
00:41 - cnn.com or whatever that you are coming
00:43 - from the u.s and not from austria
00:45 - but let's get into the details and why
00:47 - i'm
00:48 - mentioning this today
00:50 - uh what i'm going to cover in specifics
00:53 - is
00:54 - outline which is a tool that enables you
00:56 - to set up your own virtual private
00:58 - network
01:00 - we'll get to the specifics soon
01:03 - my name is robert axelson as i mentioned
01:05 - you can find me uh
01:07 - at rob axelson on most of the things i
01:10 - didn't realize i put this in here but i
01:12 - am actually on all the things at on all
01:14 - the things as well i haven't started
01:16 - using it actively but i have it
01:17 - everywhere and it's an elias for now i
01:20 - might do something fun with it but it
01:21 - was just available i'm at i'm i'm on all
01:24 - the things at on all the things
01:27 - i'm a software developer a meetup
01:29 - organizer and a community enthusiast i
01:32 - like creating and starting and
01:35 - organizing meetups
01:37 - i now run three monthly meetups as you
01:39 - know as i mentioned before
01:42 - yeah if you want to learn more about
01:44 - mine and also co-organizers danielle
01:46 - deutsch's
01:48 - journey from
01:49 - learning to
01:51 - program to code to getting our first
01:53 - developer job which we did recently over
01:55 - the last couple couple of years both me
01:57 - and him you can
01:59 - look online
02:00 - at my website you'll find links to
02:03 - recordings of that talk we did
02:06 - okay enough about me um slides for this
02:09 - talk are already available online
02:12 - in our repo
02:13 - so have a look there also for the ones
02:15 - looking at the recordings just head on
02:17 - over there and you can look at the
02:19 - slides together no need to take notes
02:22 - what inspired this talk for me was
02:24 - recently i think within the last week
02:26 - there was a
02:28 - episode at youtube at hack5 which
02:31 - by the way is a great youtube channel a
02:33 - big shout out to them if you're
02:35 - interested in
02:37 - security or penetration testing or
02:40 - hacking be it white hat gray hat or
02:42 - black hat
02:44 - have a look at that channel they've been
02:45 - around forever and there's some really
02:47 - great stuff there down to beginner
02:50 - intros on what to do in the command line
02:52 - to using kali linux and all kinds of
02:55 - stuff
02:55 - so i really really really recommend to
02:58 - have a look if you have any interest in
02:59 - that
03:00 - topic
03:02 - okay
03:04 - so before we get into the tool that
03:05 - we're going to use let's get a little
03:06 - bit of a little bit serious and let's
03:09 - talk about a guy named john
03:12 - so
03:14 - john
03:15 - a 27 year old journalist
03:17 - ever since he was a young teen he
03:19 - learned
03:20 - about the widespread corruption in this
03:22 - country after experiencing it firsthand
03:24 - himself
03:25 - he has been driven to stop it
03:29 - john from an early age again he
03:30 - volunteered to help with the school
03:33 - paper and he learned that he had a
03:34 - talent for writing
03:37 - it was only natural to him that he
03:38 - applied to study journalism in the
03:40 - capital in the university in the capital
03:42 - of his country and he was ecstatic when
03:44 - he got accepted like this is awesome
03:49 - so john again
03:50 - after having studied for a couple of
03:52 - years he graduated with flying colors
03:55 - he easily got a job at the top newspaper
03:58 - in his country
03:59 - and john
04:00 - he was on a path he was really destined
04:02 - to be to get a great career career but
04:05 - he wanted something more
04:10 - he's this is
04:11 - there should have been a
04:13 - dash here because it looks like he has a
04:14 - disease so sorry for that but his this
04:17 - is with a dash
04:19 - regarding corruption has never really
04:21 - faded since his teens
04:23 - but his country
04:24 - had only a resemblance of a free press
04:27 - and writing about corruption was at best
04:30 - frowned upon
04:31 - still he felt repelled to speak up
04:38 - then out of the blues john was suddenly
04:40 - contacted by an anonymous source
04:44 - that had him introduced to john
04:46 - via common friend
04:50 - and led to believe that he could help
04:51 - disclose a scandal that involved highly
04:54 - powerful men
04:55 - and their corruption
04:57 - in their country
04:59 - so john agreed to meet
05:02 - a secret location was agreed upon and
05:04 - they met
05:05 - and john was both shocked and repulsed
05:08 - by the scandal his source revealed
05:10 - but he knew he get had to get a story
05:13 - publish
05:16 - the end
05:17 - shortly after the meeting john
05:18 - mysteriously went missing and john's
05:20 - story was never
05:22 - published even though this is a
05:25 - fictional story
05:27 - clearly written by me today
05:29 - mixing past and present tense
05:32 - and not a work of great
05:36 - uh oh we'll get to that afterwards not a
05:38 - work of great um
05:42 - writing talent
05:44 - it tells the story that i think
05:47 - the people behind italian wants to tell
05:49 - and help mitigate
05:53 - to confuse you i'll jump back in my
05:55 - slides
05:58 - because i think i'm missing oh there it
06:00 - is awesome
06:02 - so outline was released now in march of
06:05 - this year
06:06 - by jigsaw which is
06:08 - alphabet's cyber security division
06:13 - supposedly by techcrunch stating it's
06:16 - their cybersecurity division looked a
06:19 - little bit into it it looks more like
06:20 - they're an incubator under alphabet
06:22 - alphabet owns google if you didn't know
06:24 - so this is google-backed
06:26 - um
06:28 - that has to do with geopolitical issues
06:31 - and how to help the world or people
06:35 - better protect in those spaces
06:38 - so not strictly cyber security but it
06:40 - definitely definitely falls under that
06:42 - domain
06:44 - yes
06:44 - that's jigsaw
06:47 - i wanted this talk to be a bit um
06:50 - again back to the title uh deploy to be
06:53 - a bit interactive
06:55 - i want to state this because i'll get
06:56 - back to it later this talk is this uh
07:00 - youtube video um is 17 17 minutes long
07:04 - and we'll cover some stuff that i won't
07:05 - cover today what we'll cover now
07:07 - together is uh going to the website
07:09 - downloading the tool
07:12 - and then
07:13 - um installing it and setting up our own
07:16 - vpn and hopefully the demo guards are
07:18 - with us and the internet is stable
07:21 - and we'll see if we can get this done
07:25 - so let's do this
07:27 - are two links we need there one is the
07:29 - website to download it the other one is
07:31 - my
07:33 - referral link to the place we can use as
07:38 - for hosting a vps for hosting this
07:40 - keep in mind if you use this link you
07:42 - will get ten dollars credit i will get
07:45 - some credit on my part if you prefer not
07:47 - to do it it'll be apparent later on in
07:49 - the talk where you can go to do it
07:51 - without involving me i want that to be
07:53 - perfectly clear because i'm not
07:55 - doing this
07:56 - yeah
07:58 - for those reasons
08:00 - and just a super quick shout out we my
08:04 - company are looking for both front-end
08:06 - and back-end developers if you are
08:08 - interested here are the details contact
08:11 - me email or check on the website
08:15 - yeah
08:16 - i'm a front-end developer in my team we
08:19 - use vue.js
08:20 - javascript mainly
08:23 - have a look if you're interested cool
08:26 - so let's do this
08:30 - it's as simple as using the link
08:31 - goingtogetoutline.org
08:33 - they are framing this for journalists
08:35 - but keep in mind you could use this
08:37 - yourself you would have to pay for the
08:39 - hosting we'll get into that
08:41 - as a monthly cost
08:43 - but when you have set it up you can by
08:46 - click of a few buttons send a link to
08:48 - your friend or contact wherever you want
08:51 - to connect with
08:53 - via a vpn encrypted
08:57 - securely and privately as you can get
08:59 - there's always potential loopholes and
09:01 - with humans involved and attack vectors
09:04 - like i want i cannot stand on stage and
09:06 - say you will be hundred percent secure
09:09 - uh but as secure as we can get in this
09:11 - day and age
09:13 - and then you can invite them and they'll
09:15 - be connected via your vpn and you can
09:17 - safely communicate with them
09:20 - one thing to add about um
09:23 - what we're going to do or no the the
09:25 - reason for for using such a tool is not
09:27 - just for journalists if you are
09:30 - connected
09:32 - let's say in
09:33 - starbucks which is notoriously one of
09:36 - the examples for you shouldn't check
09:38 - your online banking if you're at
09:39 - starbucks or any open wi-fi network
09:41 - because anyone that just puts up a
09:43 - computer and knows something they can
09:45 - sniff the data and they'll figure all
09:46 - this stuff out
09:49 - this is as safe as you can get
09:51 - by still being connected in the public
09:54 - open wi-fi
09:56 - first before you share anything
09:59 - private or sensitive
10:01 - you connect via the vpn and then you
10:04 - proceed to communicate what you want it
10:06 - to be
10:08 - hidden or you log into your online bank
10:10 - or you log into facebook or whatever you
10:12 - don't want anyone else to possibly be
10:14 - able to snoop right so that's also a use
10:16 - case besides the journalism stuff so
10:21 - we just scroll down and we go to get
10:23 - outline managers there's by the way also
10:26 - um mobile clients
10:28 - um hack five mentioned that it's not
10:30 - covered on all the devices for me it
10:32 - seems like so but there might be some
10:36 - some caveats there
10:38 - but for our demonstration now
10:41 - we'll just go and get
10:43 - for linux
10:45 - you can also download so you can
10:47 - initially set this up via wizard on
10:49 - windows or mac os and we'll see why that
10:52 - is the case it's downloading down here
10:54 - now and over half of the way true so
10:57 - we'll just wait for that
10:58 - in the meantime i'll get up a terminal
11:04 - and we'll soon get going
11:06 - so
11:07 - for those of you who aren't
11:09 - so tactical or
11:11 - you don't even have to be technical to
11:13 - not understand what's going on right now
11:15 - but i'm on linux and what i do now might
11:17 - seem esoteric the only thing i'm doing
11:18 - is opening the file so at windows you
11:22 - would just double click the exe file and
11:23 - it would would happen by itself a little
11:25 - bit more complicated here but it's just
11:28 - a couple of lines of code or
11:30 - command line
11:31 - commands
11:33 - so i just have to give it
11:37 - i won't go into details the one that
11:39 - knows what this is knows it
11:44 - so
11:45 - now i'll just
11:47 - execute it
11:50 - apparently not
11:58 - okay
12:08 - uh-huh
12:11 - what
12:32 - plus x thank you
12:36 - shout out to however spotted the error
12:39 - we got it now
12:40 - there we go
12:42 - so
12:44 - here we go let's see uh maybe i'll break
12:47 - it now
12:49 - yeah we cannot maximize it so it's is
12:51 - the biggest we get
12:52 - i'll go a step back because i see it
12:54 - knows i already started this earlier
12:56 - today so i'll sign out
12:58 - this is what it would look like for you
13:00 - when you just open this up the first
13:01 - time it does expect you to have an
13:03 - account that digital ocean digitalocean
13:06 - is a
13:07 - vps a virtual private server provider
13:11 - they compete in the space against amazon
13:14 - and google cloud and so on
13:16 - they more are in the business of giving
13:18 - you a dedicated virtual server
13:20 - at them with a certain amount of power
13:23 - and then you pay per month and you do
13:25 - whatever you want with them
13:27 - with it
13:29 - you can start as low as five dollars a
13:30 - month and that's what this is based on
13:34 - so you have to pay five dollars to try
13:35 - this out first you do create an account
13:38 - you can do that via here or you can use
13:40 - the link i mentioned
13:41 - robert e go.do and you get
13:44 - 10 credit
13:47 - to start this out right now i just have
13:49 - to sign in
13:54 - awesome
13:56 - i don't think you have to agree to any
13:58 - gdpr
14:01 - compliance and sign on the papers to see
14:04 - my email but um
14:06 - since we had a talk before
14:09 - let me just get
14:11 - my mobile ready so i can do the second
14:15 - two factor authentication here
14:17 - and i have to change the password this
14:20 - this doesn't work
14:22 - but we should be covered
14:26 - so you see you see my second email
14:28 - awesome
14:34 - maybe you can hear from the way i'm
14:36 - typing what my password is
14:39 - awesome
14:41 - awesome so
14:43 - i just gonna get my one of my account
14:47 - passwords awesome
14:49 - so
14:51 - so you create your account and you just
14:52 - sign in
14:55 - now it might prompt me for something
14:57 - awesome so give me one second
15:11 - okay
15:12 - so here's the magic and this is where i
15:14 - found this really great for um our
15:16 - meetup today
15:18 - um that
15:20 - with digitalocean you can
15:22 - choose a country that the server is in
15:24 - that's also on topic today you can
15:26 - choose it to be in the eu for example
15:28 - and also we're very close to frankfort
15:30 - so that's awesome
15:32 - then i'm pressing the button
15:35 - and i'm telling it to set it up for me
15:38 - it is doing that and this might take two
15:40 - minutes it says while we're doing that
15:42 - um
15:43 - once this is done what we will see will
15:45 - be inside my digitalocean account
15:48 - and then we will see that it actually
15:49 - has created a new
15:51 - server
15:53 - and if you are interested if you do this
15:56 - it's an entry port to be able to log
15:58 - into your own server and get a little
16:00 - bit of feel of what linux is and system
16:03 - administration
16:04 - because it starts with these small
16:06 - experiments it did for me i was like
16:08 - what is this vps can i host besides
16:10 - using hostgator or
16:12 - one and one or one of these
16:14 - hosting providers
16:17 - how much knowledge would it need to do
16:20 - it on my own and before i learned to
16:22 - program the free code camp i took a
16:24 - course at linux academy and learned to
16:26 - host via the lamp stack linux linux
16:29 - apache mysql and php
16:33 - using these kind of tools online and if
16:36 - i didn't want to use the vps anymore
16:38 - after a day i could just destroy it and
16:40 - only pay for that one or two days but
16:42 - it's a great way for learning these kind
16:44 - of things
16:45 - and now we see that there is already
16:48 - so this kept going on in the background
16:50 - i'm just going to refresh for the sake
16:51 - of clarity
16:54 - what this did in the background was that
16:55 - this is my normal server and i'm giving
16:57 - you the ip address this is awesome so i
16:59 - should probably change that ah it's fine
17:01 - it's fine
17:02 - if you know my domain name you can find
17:04 - this ip address publicly available
17:08 - this is the one the server that i
17:10 - created this is its unique ip address so
17:13 - if you try to attack this ip address as
17:15 - a hacker or whatever
17:16 - what you are just directing at is the
17:20 - vpn
17:23 - server that we just set up by clicking a
17:26 - button
17:27 - so it can be done magically easy like
17:29 - this now the thing i won't go into
17:31 - detail upon
17:32 - now is how you would share this because
17:35 - the video that i mentioned earlier that
17:36 - i have a link to goes into better detail
17:39 - of explaining this and for me to demo
17:41 - this on this desktop i would need also
17:43 - to have a shared screen of a phone or
17:46 - another desktop to show the interaction
17:48 - what's going on right so that does that
17:50 - much better we can do that at a key part
17:55 - i'm not connected okay get connected
17:58 - connect this device
18:07 - okay
18:08 - it gives us some stuff to install
18:12 - so i won't do that now with you because
18:14 - that's too um
18:18 - it doesn't give you anything the only
18:19 - thing we see after this is done is that
18:21 - i can click a key to share with someone
18:23 - else
18:24 - but we have done uh the the hard part
18:27 - already believe me
18:28 - so
18:29 - we're almost done we're almost true uh
18:31 - but keep in mind that you can use
18:33 - something like
18:34 - digital lotion to do these kind of
18:36 - things on your own either for a vpn
18:40 - and you can be ready in a second or you
18:43 - can do it for different services if you
18:46 - want to host wordpress on your own
18:48 - if you're interested in
18:50 - trying out linux
18:52 - if you want to do something like you've
18:54 - heard about this ghost alternative to
18:58 - wordpress or you want to set up instead
19:00 - of github you want to set up git lab for
19:02 - yourself or your team
19:04 - if you want to play around with my
19:05 - sequel there's a lot of stuff that are
19:07 - already
19:08 - um there for you with a click of a
19:11 - button mean stack for example is mongodb
19:14 - nginx
19:16 - angular
19:18 - and node.js so on topic for free
19:20 - codecamp it's uh javascript based and if
19:23 - i click here now so i've chosen that one
19:25 - i can say i want the minimum one
19:28 - i want to have it in frankfurt
19:31 - and i want to have ipv6 and
19:36 - i want to add my ssh
19:39 - oh it's a public key it's fine
19:41 - and
19:42 - i can give it a name and create and it
19:44 - goes through the same process again and
19:46 - when i'm done with this i get an ip
19:48 - address i can ssh into it that means
19:50 - that i can connect to it from my laptop
19:52 - and i can be in an environment where i
19:54 - can do
19:55 - stuff from the command line to
19:58 - put stuff on my server to host stuff
20:01 - create an app and already have it
20:03 - available in ip so i don't have to just
20:05 - have localhost on my computer so there's
20:07 - tons of possibilities but that starts by
20:11 - being curious about
20:13 - what virtual private services what linux
20:15 - is and how you can do these things on
20:17 - your own and believe me when i say
20:18 - anyone can learn it
20:20 - i could
20:21 - i got it working and little lotion to
20:24 - top it off also has a great
20:27 - um
20:29 - i can't
20:30 - find a
20:31 - link to it but they have a great
20:34 - article base or
20:37 - they have a lot of how to's on how to do
20:38 - these things step by step really step by
20:41 - step anyone can do this
20:44 - and you can also use these tutorials and
20:46 - i really recommend it even if you are
20:48 - not curious about the digital ocean at

Cleaned transcript:

thank you everyone for coming my name is robert axelsson besides from organizing this meetup i'm also going to give a talk uh to you today on the topic on the topic of deploying a vpn a vpn is a virtual private network that enables it for you to connect to that server or that network from your connection when you are connected to the internet and it gives room for you to encrypt your data and also to bypass as a proxy if your server vpn network is in the us it will appear most probably for the person that you are accessing the website at for example cnn.com or whatever that you are coming from the u.s and not from austria but let's get into the details and why i'm mentioning this today uh what i'm going to cover in specifics is outline which is a tool that enables you to set up your own virtual private network we'll get to the specifics soon my name is robert axelson as i mentioned you can find me uh at rob axelson on most of the things i didn't realize i put this in here but i am actually on all the things at on all the things as well i haven't started using it actively but i have it everywhere and it's an elias for now i might do something fun with it but it was just available i'm at i'm i'm on all the things at on all the things i'm a software developer a meetup organizer and a community enthusiast i like creating and starting and organizing meetups i now run three monthly meetups as you know as i mentioned before yeah if you want to learn more about mine and also coorganizers danielle deutsch's journey from learning to program to code to getting our first developer job which we did recently over the last couple couple of years both me and him you can look online at my website you'll find links to recordings of that talk we did okay enough about me um slides for this talk are already available online in our repo so have a look there also for the ones looking at the recordings just head on over there and you can look at the slides together no need to take notes what inspired this talk for me was recently i think within the last week there was a episode at youtube at hack5 which by the way is a great youtube channel a big shout out to them if you're interested in security or penetration testing or hacking be it white hat gray hat or black hat have a look at that channel they've been around forever and there's some really great stuff there down to beginner intros on what to do in the command line to using kali linux and all kinds of stuff so i really really really recommend to have a look if you have any interest in that topic okay so before we get into the tool that we're going to use let's get a little bit of a little bit serious and let's talk about a guy named john so john a 27 year old journalist ever since he was a young teen he learned about the widespread corruption in this country after experiencing it firsthand himself he has been driven to stop it john from an early age again he volunteered to help with the school paper and he learned that he had a talent for writing it was only natural to him that he applied to study journalism in the capital in the university in the capital of his country and he was ecstatic when he got accepted like this is awesome so john again after having studied for a couple of years he graduated with flying colors he easily got a job at the top newspaper in his country and john he was on a path he was really destined to be to get a great career career but he wanted something more he's this is there should have been a dash here because it looks like he has a disease so sorry for that but his this is with a dash regarding corruption has never really faded since his teens but his country had only a resemblance of a free press and writing about corruption was at best frowned upon still he felt repelled to speak up then out of the blues john was suddenly contacted by an anonymous source that had him introduced to john via common friend and led to believe that he could help disclose a scandal that involved highly powerful men and their corruption in their country so john agreed to meet a secret location was agreed upon and they met and john was both shocked and repulsed by the scandal his source revealed but he knew he get had to get a story publish the end shortly after the meeting john mysteriously went missing and john's story was never published even though this is a fictional story clearly written by me today mixing past and present tense and not a work of great uh oh we'll get to that afterwards not a work of great um writing talent it tells the story that i think the people behind italian wants to tell and help mitigate to confuse you i'll jump back in my slides because i think i'm missing oh there it is awesome so outline was released now in march of this year by jigsaw which is alphabet's cyber security division supposedly by techcrunch stating it's their cybersecurity division looked a little bit into it it looks more like they're an incubator under alphabet alphabet owns google if you didn't know so this is googlebacked um that has to do with geopolitical issues and how to help the world or people better protect in those spaces so not strictly cyber security but it definitely definitely falls under that domain yes that's jigsaw i wanted this talk to be a bit um again back to the title uh deploy to be a bit interactive i want to state this because i'll get back to it later this talk is this uh youtube video um is 17 17 minutes long and we'll cover some stuff that i won't cover today what we'll cover now together is uh going to the website downloading the tool and then um installing it and setting up our own vpn and hopefully the demo guards are with us and the internet is stable and we'll see if we can get this done so let's do this are two links we need there one is the website to download it the other one is my referral link to the place we can use as for hosting a vps for hosting this keep in mind if you use this link you will get ten dollars credit i will get some credit on my part if you prefer not to do it it'll be apparent later on in the talk where you can go to do it without involving me i want that to be perfectly clear because i'm not doing this yeah for those reasons and just a super quick shout out we my company are looking for both frontend and backend developers if you are interested here are the details contact me email or check on the website yeah i'm a frontend developer in my team we use vue.js javascript mainly have a look if you're interested cool so let's do this it's as simple as using the link goingtogetoutline.org they are framing this for journalists but keep in mind you could use this yourself you would have to pay for the hosting we'll get into that as a monthly cost but when you have set it up you can by click of a few buttons send a link to your friend or contact wherever you want to connect with via a vpn encrypted securely and privately as you can get there's always potential loopholes and with humans involved and attack vectors like i want i cannot stand on stage and say you will be hundred percent secure uh but as secure as we can get in this day and age and then you can invite them and they'll be connected via your vpn and you can safely communicate with them one thing to add about um what we're going to do or no the the reason for for using such a tool is not just for journalists if you are connected let's say in starbucks which is notoriously one of the examples for you shouldn't check your online banking if you're at starbucks or any open wifi network because anyone that just puts up a computer and knows something they can sniff the data and they'll figure all this stuff out this is as safe as you can get by still being connected in the public open wifi first before you share anything private or sensitive you connect via the vpn and then you proceed to communicate what you want it to be hidden or you log into your online bank or you log into facebook or whatever you don't want anyone else to possibly be able to snoop right so that's also a use case besides the journalism stuff so we just scroll down and we go to get outline managers there's by the way also um mobile clients um hack five mentioned that it's not covered on all the devices for me it seems like so but there might be some some caveats there but for our demonstration now we'll just go and get for linux you can also download so you can initially set this up via wizard on windows or mac os and we'll see why that is the case it's downloading down here now and over half of the way true so we'll just wait for that in the meantime i'll get up a terminal and we'll soon get going so for those of you who aren't so tactical or you don't even have to be technical to not understand what's going on right now but i'm on linux and what i do now might seem esoteric the only thing i'm doing is opening the file so at windows you would just double click the exe file and it would would happen by itself a little bit more complicated here but it's just a couple of lines of code or command line commands so i just have to give it i won't go into details the one that knows what this is knows it so now i'll just execute it apparently not okay uhhuh what plus x thank you shout out to however spotted the error we got it now there we go so here we go let's see uh maybe i'll break it now yeah we cannot maximize it so it's is the biggest we get i'll go a step back because i see it knows i already started this earlier today so i'll sign out this is what it would look like for you when you just open this up the first time it does expect you to have an account that digital ocean digitalocean is a vps a virtual private server provider they compete in the space against amazon and google cloud and so on they more are in the business of giving you a dedicated virtual server at them with a certain amount of power and then you pay per month and you do whatever you want with them with it you can start as low as five dollars a month and that's what this is based on so you have to pay five dollars to try this out first you do create an account you can do that via here or you can use the link i mentioned robert e go.do and you get 10 credit to start this out right now i just have to sign in awesome i don't think you have to agree to any gdpr compliance and sign on the papers to see my email but um since we had a talk before let me just get my mobile ready so i can do the second two factor authentication here and i have to change the password this this doesn't work but we should be covered so you see you see my second email awesome maybe you can hear from the way i'm typing what my password is awesome awesome so i just gonna get my one of my account passwords awesome so so you create your account and you just sign in now it might prompt me for something awesome so give me one second okay so here's the magic and this is where i found this really great for um our meetup today um that with digitalocean you can choose a country that the server is in that's also on topic today you can choose it to be in the eu for example and also we're very close to frankfort so that's awesome then i'm pressing the button and i'm telling it to set it up for me it is doing that and this might take two minutes it says while we're doing that um once this is done what we will see will be inside my digitalocean account and then we will see that it actually has created a new server and if you are interested if you do this it's an entry port to be able to log into your own server and get a little bit of feel of what linux is and system administration because it starts with these small experiments it did for me i was like what is this vps can i host besides using hostgator or one and one or one of these hosting providers how much knowledge would it need to do it on my own and before i learned to program the free code camp i took a course at linux academy and learned to host via the lamp stack linux linux apache mysql and php using these kind of tools online and if i didn't want to use the vps anymore after a day i could just destroy it and only pay for that one or two days but it's a great way for learning these kind of things and now we see that there is already so this kept going on in the background i'm just going to refresh for the sake of clarity what this did in the background was that this is my normal server and i'm giving you the ip address this is awesome so i should probably change that ah it's fine it's fine if you know my domain name you can find this ip address publicly available this is the one the server that i created this is its unique ip address so if you try to attack this ip address as a hacker or whatever what you are just directing at is the vpn server that we just set up by clicking a button so it can be done magically easy like this now the thing i won't go into detail upon now is how you would share this because the video that i mentioned earlier that i have a link to goes into better detail of explaining this and for me to demo this on this desktop i would need also to have a shared screen of a phone or another desktop to show the interaction what's going on right so that does that much better we can do that at a key part i'm not connected okay get connected connect this device okay it gives us some stuff to install so i won't do that now with you because that's too um it doesn't give you anything the only thing we see after this is done is that i can click a key to share with someone else but we have done uh the the hard part already believe me so we're almost done we're almost true uh but keep in mind that you can use something like digital lotion to do these kind of things on your own either for a vpn and you can be ready in a second or you can do it for different services if you want to host wordpress on your own if you're interested in trying out linux if you want to do something like you've heard about this ghost alternative to wordpress or you want to set up instead of github you want to set up git lab for yourself or your team if you want to play around with my sequel there's a lot of stuff that are already um there for you with a click of a button mean stack for example is mongodb nginx angular and node.js so on topic for free codecamp it's uh javascript based and if i click here now so i've chosen that one i can say i want the minimum one i want to have it in frankfurt and i want to have ipv6 and i want to add my ssh oh it's a public key it's fine and i can give it a name and create and it goes through the same process again and when i'm done with this i get an ip address i can ssh into it that means that i can connect to it from my laptop and i can be in an environment where i can do stuff from the command line to put stuff on my server to host stuff create an app and already have it available in ip so i don't have to just have localhost on my computer so there's tons of possibilities but that starts by being curious about what virtual private services what linux is and how you can do these things on your own and believe me when i say anyone can learn it i could i got it working and little lotion to top it off also has a great um i can't find a link to it but they have a great article base or they have a lot of how to's on how to do these things step by step really step by step anyone can do this and you can also use these tutorials and i really recommend it even if you are not curious about the digital ocean at all if you're using something else or would you like to use another provider they have a great reputation for having really topnotch articles and i go to them often just if there's something i'm curious about myself and oh how do i do this i often first go to digitalocean so enough about them but i really mean it when i say have a look there if you're curious and to end the talk here are the links not here they are and thank you
