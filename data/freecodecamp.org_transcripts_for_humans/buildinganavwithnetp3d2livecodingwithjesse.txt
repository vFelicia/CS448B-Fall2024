With timestamps:

00:07 - hey everybody its Jesse and in this
00:12 - stream you all can watch me would do my
00:18 - day-to-day work I'm just a front-end
00:21 - developer to university and this is not
00:24 - scripted at all and so I'll make
00:27 - mistakes and try to work through them
00:29 - and hopefully we can help each other and
00:32 - and learn together so today we're gonna
00:36 - continue with what we were doing
00:38 - yesterday and that is trying to turn
00:43 - this header into something that looks
00:48 - like this so today I think we'll we'll
00:54 - just work on this header portion we'll
00:55 - save the side nav for another day
00:57 - because I don't think we'll get through
00:59 - it all in one stream the main site that
01:05 - the main goal is to make this site run
01:08 - more quickly so we'll load it up here
01:17 - not bad that was a little bit faster
01:20 - than usual the internet connection is
01:22 - good here and this site is hosted on
01:25 - campus so shouldn't be too much of a
01:28 - round trip but you can see the current
01:31 - site this is gonna change significantly
01:33 - we went over a lot of the changes in
01:36 - yesterday stream so if you missed that
01:38 - you could check that out probably and
01:41 - it'll be in the first half of that
01:42 - stream so this is a copy of that page
01:46 - with most of the stuff removed so I
01:51 - haven't done that much since yesterday
01:55 - let me show you what I did do
01:58 - so yesterday one of the last things we
02:00 - did was make a test version of this main
02:04 - nav component and we had it connected to
02:10 - the main nav
02:13 - dot cs5 whoops and I just noticed I put
02:17 - two dots in there so let's let's rename
02:23 - that now before before it messes
02:27 - something up sorry about that my phone's
02:38 - ringing I don't recognize the number so
02:40 - I'm just gonna let it go okay so now
02:46 - that has the correct name and what we've
02:48 - done is we've brought imported this in
02:53 - here as maintenance so the reason I did
02:57 - that is because I was looking through
02:59 - this a little bit and there were some
03:01 - areas where I thought we may want to
03:03 - change the mark up like for instance you
03:05 - know we do have some you know some HTML
03:10 - you know that we may want to change so I
03:15 - figured you know I may as well make a
03:17 - test page you know first if if you
03:22 - weren't watching yesterday an important
03:26 - thing to know about this project is that
03:29 - this file structure that you just saw a
03:32 - second ago here these are the live files
03:35 - for the site so there is no test site
03:38 - there's there is something that they
03:42 - call a test site but it shares all the
03:44 - same files so I'm not really sure what
03:47 - what about it is a test site I think
03:52 - maybe it has a different database but so
03:57 - that's why we have to make copies test
04:01 - copies of all these files before we make
04:03 - anything go alive all right so let me
04:10 - check out the live chat just say hello
04:14 - to everyone before we get started
04:16 - hey everybody
04:21 - alright so the way I divide up things in
04:27 - this stream is with a Pomodoro timer so
04:30 - I'm gonna start this and we're gonna do
04:31 - 25 minutes of coding and then I'll do
04:36 - five minutes of answering questions in
04:38 - the live chat and I'll check back in
04:41 - periodically during the coding into live
04:44 - chat especially if I need some help or
04:48 - you know if I if I get to a point where
04:51 - I think someone might have something to
04:53 - say then I'll check back over there but
04:57 - otherwise if you ask a question during
04:59 - that 25-minute period just hang in there
05:01 - and I'll do my best to get to it during
05:03 - the five minutes after we do probably
05:06 - about two Pomodoro sessions then I'll
05:10 - take the end of the stream and answer
05:11 - any questions that are left over that I
05:13 - didn't get to so if you could stick
05:16 - around to the end your question will be
05:19 - answered eventually and if you can't
05:22 - stick around to the end go ahead and ask
05:23 - it anyway and then you can catch the
05:25 - recording later on it's also not a bad
05:29 - idea just ask a question whenever I am
05:32 - coding and there are a lot of people in
05:34 - the live chat that are so knowledgeable
05:36 - more knowledgeable than me and on a lot
05:39 - of things and they can help you out as
05:42 - well okay so let's get started I think I
05:48 - saw some new some new names I haven't
05:51 - seen before in the live chat so if
05:52 - you're new welcome thank you so much for
05:55 - for joining joining in the live chat and
05:59 - for watching alright let's get started
06:03 - well one thing that we're definitely
06:05 - going to have to do is change the
06:07 - structure of this of this navbar I mean
06:13 - this is the HTML was significantly
06:17 - different so that's what we'll work on
06:20 - first I'm also using materialize the
06:25 - materialized CSS framework to do this so
06:30 - we're gonna bring that in I'm so I'm
06:33 - hesitant to bring in another framework
06:38 - on a site that's already really slow but
06:42 - we're already loading jQuery so we're
06:47 - not adding anything by using a framework
06:49 - that's going to need jQuery as well and
06:52 - we can't get rid of it there's just too
06:54 - much on the site already that's using it
06:56 - so since we already have jQuery I think
07:01 - it'll be all right
07:02 - what we'll probably end up doing is
07:04 - after we get everything looking how we
07:07 - want we can go through the materialized
07:10 - JavaScript and CSS and remove anything
07:13 - that we're not using and get those file
07:15 - sizes down you know as small as we can
07:19 - but I think the benefit of being able to
07:22 - use a lot of the things that are built
07:23 - in to to materialize is is do not
07:28 - outweigh our you know any you know
07:34 - slight increase I think you know in load
07:37 - times you know it'll be it'll be minimal
07:43 - okay this is also officially project
07:47 - three now in the video so in the titles
07:50 - of the videos I'll I'll put in
07:52 - parentheses at the end of each title
07:56 - it'll be p3 for project three and then
07:59 - I'll put D this is day two so it's D two
08:02 - that way it'll be a little bit easier to
08:04 - keep up I'll probably make a playlist
08:07 - once I get a few more videos I'll make a
08:09 - playlist specifically for this project
08:13 - this project we may have to work on a
08:17 - little bit and then do some other stuff
08:20 - and then maybe come back to it you know
08:21 - this is a really large site it's going
08:23 - to be an ongoing project I'm gonna move
08:26 - this over to my other screen and I'm
08:31 - also gonna move this over because dev
08:35 - tools is probably going to be more
08:37 - useful at this point and also my
08:41 - my editors so at first
08:45 - let me grab let me get Adam also I
08:49 - finally figured out four on project two
08:51 - I figured out how to position that I
08:55 - that checkbox icon so if anybody's
08:57 - interested in how I did that just ask it
09:00 - in the live chat and I'll get to it
09:02 - during one of the question
09:03 - question-and-answer sessions so it
09:07 - actually it took me three times as long
09:09 - as I estimated that it would take it was
09:12 - quite frustrating but I finally got it
09:15 - to the point where it it works and it
09:18 - looks the way I wanted to look okay so
09:21 - here's the Trello board for this project
09:23 - a lot of stuff going on here I'm not
09:30 - sure if I even have one for the header
09:31 - right now I'm not gonna worry about this
09:34 - now the reason I scrolled over was to
09:36 - get to this so this is the the project
09:42 - that you just saw the the goal header
09:46 - right how we want it to look so I want
09:50 - to grab the mark-up for that that nav
09:54 - from here bring it over and then we'll
09:59 - go from there and trying to plug in the
10:02 - data from the content management system
10:05 - and the the CMS that we're using is
10:07 - called Ektron it's it's pretty old so
10:15 - we'll see how it works we're just gonna
10:18 - have to learn it as we you know how
10:20 - things are put together as we go along
10:24 - alright
10:28 - that's the side now we're not gonna mess
10:30 - with the side nav right now okay
10:33 - so I think this should be it if we just
10:37 - grab this nav element and we can double
10:40 - check mmm
10:45 - actually we're gonna need we need this
10:46 - div as well we need to grab the entire
10:50 - header let's bring over the entire
10:53 - header we're gonna need to do it at some
10:55 - point anyway so you may as well do it
10:58 - now like I said we're not really gonna
11:01 - work on the side nav for now mm-hmm
11:05 - that's interesting I think I can safely
11:09 - take that out everything's working it's
11:12 - been commented out for a while
11:22 - okay
11:35 - I was just thinking we could potentially
11:38 - split this up into two different
11:40 - components but I I think it'll be easier
11:45 - to start out with just to put it all in
11:46 - the main nav component and then if we we
11:50 - feel like it's too much at some point we
11:52 - can always split it out at that point
11:57 - okay so now that we have that we
11:59 - shouldn't really need to come back to
12:01 - this except maybe to grab maybe some
12:08 - some of the materialized code I want to
12:10 - see where I'm loading this if I'm using
12:12 - a CDN or not okay so I am importing the
12:20 - JavaScript from a CDN but I want to get
12:25 - the latest version so we can just go on
12:27 - materialized and figure out where the
12:30 - latest versions are okay so let's go I'm
12:37 - gonna leave this in for now and we're
12:39 - just gonna have to edit this to make it
12:40 - work with with our search bugs all right
12:47 - I think
12:53 - hmm
13:04 - alright all of this is commented out I'm
13:09 - gonna get rid of this because we can
13:11 - always refer to it in the version the
13:15 - non-test version of this in case there's
13:18 - something that something in here that
13:20 - would be useful to us but for now I'm
13:23 - just gonna get rid of all of this yeah
13:30 - we're just gonna get rid of the nav I
13:35 - guess we can't I want to keep some of
13:37 - this down here so this this template so
13:44 - everything inside this repeater I do
13:47 - want to keep for now just to reference
13:49 - it but all of this can go let me know if
13:58 - the font size is big enough area okay so
14:04 - that's everything and I should be able
14:08 - to paste the the indentation on this is
14:13 - not great let's bring it back a bit
14:26 - so I'm using Visual Studio code for this
14:29 - which I don't normally use so it's
14:33 - that's a little bit of a different feel
14:35 - to it so I'm still kind of getting used
14:39 - to that all right let's see all right so
14:49 - let's paste this in now and so we do
14:56 - have some of the header and the nav so
14:59 - we can get rid of we can get rid of this
15:04 - nav and I guess this ul
15:18 - I guess Oh worry about indentation later
15:25 - I'm gonna take that out it's comment it
15:27 - out so probably don't need it and that's
15:36 - where it's it was closed we'll take that
15:39 - out as well and here's our huge side nav
15:44 - okay this is what I wanted so now we got
15:48 - down to here
15:50 - [Music]
15:54 - let's take take these two out since we
15:58 - deleted deleted them up there these are
16:00 - just closing text what will be deleted
16:02 - and let's grab you know what let's
16:11 - remove this and we'll just pull up the
16:17 - other version of this the live version
16:20 - and then we can put it over here and and
16:25 - just look look on refer to it on that
16:30 - side so let me bring this
16:38 - okay
16:47 - alright let me scroll down good so this
16:52 - is what we we want to bring in this
16:57 - repeater and then there's a template for
17:02 - our for our links in here so we kind of
17:05 - just want to break this down try to
17:07 - figure out what's going on and what data
17:11 - is being imported hopefully the names
17:13 - are gonna be descriptive enough that
17:17 - we'll be able to tell what's you know
17:18 - what's going on we may have to just kind
17:20 - of look around a bit and refer to the
17:23 - site and and figure it out but we should
17:27 - have all the data that we need you know
17:29 - just from these from this template
17:34 - basically to populate our new nav so the
17:40 - the social media I think I mentioned
17:42 - this yesterday all the social media
17:44 - links we're just going to keep them as
17:46 - is and we'll just hard code the URLs I
17:53 - think right now there's yeah I don't
17:55 - even have URLs in there right now so we
17:58 - will hard code those in there and I'm
18:01 - okay with that let's see what we really
18:09 - want we really need to worry about
18:13 - pulling in dynamically or these links
18:18 - the donate button can be hard coded and
18:25 - probably these ones these ones can be
18:29 - are coded this about academics
18:31 - admissions faith life those are not
18:34 - likely to change it's more these she's
18:39 - interior links actually these aren't
18:44 - likely to change it may be a lot easier
18:49 - than I thought to put in the new header
18:51 - will be the tricky part as the side now
18:53 - so we may actually get get to the side
18:56 - enough we'll see we'll see how tough it
18:58 - is to get this header working
19:00 - you know we still still haven't even
19:03 - tested it we do need to hook up this
19:09 - search input so we need to see how it's
19:16 - working here and try to pull in all the
19:25 - same values and see if it can work here
19:28 - as well so actually bringing in this
19:36 - text box search
19:47 - I'm checking the I'm just shade a live
19:49 - chat briefly okay I think this is
19:59 - probably we're gonna have to find this
20:04 - because I want to make sure
20:15 - that's interesting I must have I must
20:23 - have opened up the site in dev tools and
20:28 - pulled in the names from into there
20:32 - which was okay and would normally work
20:36 - but I'd rather pull it in here since we
20:40 - can get these values kind of more
20:41 - directly so let's try to find this
20:46 - textbox let's see let me get out of mode
20:56 - so I can get it to here so what was that
21:02 - called again
21:03 - it was the text text box let's see if we
21:10 - can find it
21:25 - okay this is some of the search stuff
21:32 - but not not the text box
21:45 - okay I was hoping it was in there but I
21:48 - don't think it is so let's see where
21:50 - else
21:58 - hmm
22:11 - I want to check out what gets what the
22:15 - output of this is if it's just simply an
22:19 - input then we don't really need to know
22:22 - anything else so and that'll be fine
22:26 - is we'll just put in these these values
22:27 - so let's look at the site in dev tools
22:37 - then alright so this is the inputs let
22:45 - me make sure whoops
22:47 - alright so it is this day of his header
22:50 - search so within that div yes all we
22:53 - have is just the input great alright
22:56 - then we don't really need to find out
22:58 - where this textbox is coming from let's
23:00 - just plug in these values that we need
23:04 - so probably the easiest thing will be to
23:08 - just copy this whole thing and paste it
23:13 - in there and we'll make sure we add the
23:16 - right class names for our styles to work
23:20 - so we want the placeholder I guess it
23:27 - can be can be searched with the dots
23:29 - that's fine name search type search
23:34 - class okay that looks good I actually
23:43 - don't really have any any other class
23:47 - name so this will be perfect okay great
23:53 - and that should be it the search should
23:57 - work now you can see there's nothing
24:00 - else you know being pulled in here this
24:02 - is just plain HTML the same way with
24:05 - this this icon here so all this should
24:12 - be fine
24:15 - great now while we're doing this we
24:21 - should probably put it in the side nav
24:23 - as well since I'm I have a search input
24:27 - in the side nav so let me double check
24:30 - to see if I have anything different
24:32 - going on I don't think so
24:34 - so let's put that in there as well all
24:39 - right now that's ready and those should
24:43 - work we could actually I wonder what
24:50 - this looks like now that we've been kind
24:52 - of messing around with it
24:53 - put it up pull with put this on another
24:55 - screen okay we're definitely getting
24:59 - some errors here let me pull this over
25:01 - to show you the areas that we're getting
25:03 - I do want to double check and make sure
25:05 - that none of those errors are are
25:07 - bleeding over into the main site okay
25:11 - good it still loads the site's really
25:15 - buggy so sometimes I'll change something
25:18 - that seems like it should be fine and
25:21 - not affect anything I mean just
25:22 - extremely simple things will be changed
25:25 - and large portions of the site will just
25:29 - go down and display something like this
25:30 - so I want to be really careful about you
25:37 - know double-checking this is our main
25:39 - website it you know it gets a lot of
25:41 - traffic you know in the millions of
25:44 - visits there going on a yearly basis you
25:50 - know millions so it's by far the most
25:54 - visited of all the sites that that I
25:57 - work on here for the University so you
26:02 - know realistically if that if I
26:04 - accidentally took the site down
26:05 - potentially we could lose money from
26:07 - donors and from potential students so
26:11 - it's worth the caution all right so
26:16 - let's see an error occurred it's already
26:21 - used by another control
26:24 - oh okay maybe we are gonna have a
26:34 - problem since we have things with the
26:40 - same ID yeah it could be a problem what
26:45 - ID did we have before let me check this
27:08 - yes folks
27:18 - we're gonna have to think think about
27:20 - what we want to do then for the search
27:25 - actually let's let's check this out
27:27 - right now I think there is a like a
27:31 - mobile search so I'm interested to see
27:33 - what what happens there
27:36 - so let's shrink this down and click
27:39 - search and let's see if it's the same
27:42 - input or what's going on there
27:49 - is there an ID I'm not seeing an idea at
27:52 - all okay so it's mobile search box
27:58 - mobile search placeholder search
28:13 - I tell you what I'm gonna do what I
28:15 - think might be the simplest thing just
28:19 - to test this out would be just to change
28:22 - the ID and yeah we'll just change the ID
28:29 - and see what happens and see if we can
28:32 - get it to work we should be able to
28:35 - check
28:48 - yeah if what we could possibly do is
28:53 - just have to two functions here and this
29:00 - is in I believe c-sharp I don't have
29:05 - very much experience at all the C sharp
29:07 - so if I'm messing up any terminology I
29:08 - apologize and please let me know what
29:13 - [Music]
29:16 - with the the right way to talk about
29:18 - this stuff is all right so let me search
29:26 - clear
29:49 - okay I'm just checking to see if these
29:52 - exist somewhere else in in the same file
30:02 - I'm just not sure how how these link up
30:19 - where did this come from that's just
30:22 - okay so that's just hanging out at the
30:24 - end here
30:28 - interesting
31:02 - hmm yeah I'm not exactly sure how rights
31:08 - to the on click that's firing off this
31:10 - function its button search click the on
31:15 - click handler is down here on this
31:18 - button with the class button search but
31:27 - this is what's actually visible to the
31:29 - user so I'm just trying to figure out
31:32 - how these are linked up interesting
31:46 - let me
31:49 - I want to check to see if there's okay
32:03 - okay here this is that button and we can
32:08 - see it's not
32:17 - there's there's nothing it's um
32:20 - it's not visible
32:37 - hmm
32:49 - you know what I bet the answer's up here
32:52 - I had forgotten that there was some code
32:55 - up at the top some JavaScript so we'll
32:59 - see okay so they're grabbing the
33:01 - textbook search so this key press 13 I
33:06 - think is enter so if they're gonna hit
33:08 - enter then it's going to okay then it's
33:15 - gonna just click using jQuery it's going
33:18 - to click the button search alright
33:19 - interesting so they have a hidden submit
33:22 - button and they're just using jQuery to
33:25 - make that button get clicked that works
33:29 - I definitely I don't think I would do it
33:35 - that way but I'm not upset about it
33:40 - because I understand what's going on so
33:46 - so that's good where's
33:53 - actually this is interesting too they
33:55 - have this commented out where's this
34:01 - function
34:10 - it looks like they changed it okay my
34:15 - timer went off so I'm gonna do my five
34:20 - minutes of a question answer in just a
34:22 - second but I just wanted to see if you
34:24 - all see this it's really interesting let
34:26 - me switch this to JavaScript for a
34:31 - minute we get some highlighting here we
34:33 - go and that'll be a lot easier actually
34:35 - this is not bad let's see how that's I
34:41 - might just leave it as JavaScript
34:44 - highlighting because that looks pretty
34:45 - good so if you check this out so our
34:50 - button search click it's at one point it
34:54 - seems like maybe this was the way they
34:56 - had set it up and then they changed
34:59 - their minds which which makes sense like
35:02 - I said this is not the way I would have
35:03 - done it but they changed their minds and
35:05 - they grabbed the value and then run this
35:08 - function to do the search and it's
35:14 - actually changing the URL of the page
35:18 - and then just adding the search value as
35:24 - a query string right at the end of the
35:27 - URL so that's how they decided to do the
35:32 - search so really we can get rid of we
35:36 - can get rid of all this stuff that's not
35:41 - in use
35:42 - and just kind of make this smaller clean
35:46 - it up we can also get rid of that button
35:51 - and now that we know how this works it
35:54 - really doesn't matter much what we're
35:57 - going to do with that mobile search
36:00 - because the search essentially is just
36:06 - it seems like it's all taken care of
36:08 - here I want to double check all right
36:12 - when we come back from the five minute
36:14 - break for questions the first thing I
36:18 - want to do is well I want to remove this
36:21 - button
36:22 - our test file but then also in our CS
36:25 - file I really I want to look at this and
36:29 - try to figure out what's going on and if
36:31 - this is even being called at all because
36:37 - I think the answer is no I think that
36:40 - this is not even in use so that we could
36:42 - also remove this and yeah we could
36:49 - remove this or potentially we could get
36:53 - rid of a lot of this jQuery and then
36:56 - make use of this I'm not sure what the
36:58 - best one is but let me know anybody
37:00 - especially that knows more about you
37:02 - know kind of dotnet stuff than I do
37:04 - which is probably anybody that knows
37:07 - anything about death let me know what do
37:10 - you think the best way to do this would
37:12 - be it may not matter what is it better
37:14 - to use jQuery to change the location and
37:18 - we could refactor this and not use
37:21 - jQuery if we really wanted to but I
37:25 - think we're gonna we're gonna need it
37:27 - for other places on the site so I don't
37:29 - think it would be useful to get rid of
37:31 - it or is it better to do it like this
37:37 - yeah look let me know what you think so
37:40 - let me start boobs I'm gonna start my
37:44 - five-minute timer I'm gonna do
37:46 - whoops sorry my camera first I just just
37:49 - now saw that yeah so if you remember if
37:56 - you're watching yesterday you know my
37:57 - camera kept freezing and I had to just
37:59 - restart it this is just the built-in
38:02 - camera on my iMac monitor so um I don't
38:07 - know what to do about it we'll see if it
38:10 - keeps doing this and it's a problem all
38:12 - I might just get another camera alright
38:17 - so I'm just going up to the top of the
38:19 - live chat I'm gonna run through and just
38:20 - try to find the questions and get as
38:23 - many as I can in Abdullah Abdullah not
38:32 - exactly sure how you pronounce the end
38:34 - of that so sorry
38:34 - that says what's the best laptop for
38:36 - coding yeah it depends on what operating
38:39 - system you like to use which is so smoke
38:42 - one says also mentions that depends on
38:45 - your operating system I really like a my
38:50 - macbook pro I think it's great to work
38:55 - on it starts up it's fast it has good
38:58 - battery life I've been less than
39:01 - impressed with a lot of the Windows
39:03 - laptops that I've had before but I don't
39:05 - think it's a fair comparison because
39:08 - I've never bought a Windows laptop that
39:11 - would that was as expensive as a macbook
39:14 - pro so if I were to buy a Windows laptop
39:18 - that was that expensive maybe it would
39:20 - be as good or better I'm not sure i've
39:22 - never used Linux on a laptop so I don't
39:25 - know but my next laptop purchase you
39:27 - know for my own personal use is probably
39:29 - going to be Linux I'd really like to try
39:32 - it out but I do have a MacBook I think
39:36 - it's like a 15-inch MacBook Pro and it
39:39 - was the last model that still had the
39:41 - the HDMI connection and that's been
39:45 - really useful for me because so many
39:48 - things hook up through HDMI so I really
39:50 - like that I don't remember what year
39:52 - that is maybe 2015 or something like
39:57 - that so the newer models have that that
40:01 - touch bar thing which that's pretty cool
40:03 - too
40:04 - but I think everything's done through
40:06 - USB see connectors so for right now it's
40:12 - somewhat of a problem because you know a
40:15 - lot of your older things don't don't use
40:17 - the USB see so you need a lot of
40:19 - adapters then anyway that's my as my
40:25 - thoughts on it not really technical but
40:29 - those are just some of my observations
40:38 - no Bo says Jessie can you give us the
40:40 - code that you have local on localhost
40:43 - yeah
40:43 - so let's see I figure you're probably
40:47 - talking about was that I've lost that
40:55 - that here you know anyway I'm pretty
41:01 - sure you were talking about that example
41:03 - site that we were that I was showing and
41:09 - I do have that code available so let me
41:12 - find the repo for you so I remember what
41:19 - the name of it is
41:35 - okay so here's the repository so I
41:44 - haven't done this is just the initial I
41:46 - just wanted to put this on github so you
41:48 - all have it so here it is I am I
41:52 - definitely wanna update materialized
41:57 - because this is using an older version
41:59 - so I want to update that that'll
42:02 - probably one of the first things I do to
42:04 - change this and then we're also going to
42:07 - be developing a lot of the UI elements
42:10 - here because we can make use of my local
42:13 - development environment will develop it
42:15 - here and then transfer it over into the
42:20 - test versions the test files that we
42:22 - have for the actual site and plug in the
42:27 - values that we need you know into the
42:29 - templates so we'll basically convert
42:31 - these into templates that will work on
42:34 - the site but it's going to be a lot
42:36 - faster to get them to look how we want
42:38 - them to look here locally and then move
42:43 - them over so that'll kind of be the the
42:45 - workflow we'll just switch over and try
42:49 - to go you know one component at a time
42:52 - but I will put this in the live chat and
43:00 - actually I just saw Umberto has a bunch
43:04 - of comments so I'm assuming I did
43:06 - something wrong usually when I see a lot
43:08 - of comments like that it means I did did
43:10 - something wrong so let me see all the
43:13 - web forms suggestions
43:32 - okay so let me let me read a little bit
43:35 - of what Umberto said because it's
43:37 - definitely it it's useful and it
43:40 - pertains to you know a lot so if you
43:43 - don't know from being in the live chat
43:45 - Umberto he knows about c-sharp and he's
43:50 - actually doing his own YouTube videos so
43:53 - about that which I may be watching those
43:56 - I want to watch them anyway but now I
44:00 - may really want to be watching them so
44:02 - that I can can know how about having to
44:05 - work on this project
44:09 - alright so let me read out what he said
44:11 - so he said basically said you might
44:15 - really want to create a separate folder
44:17 - with its own web config and remove the
44:20 - custom errors from the main web config
44:22 - when you add an SP control and give it
44:26 - an ID that ID is available as an object
44:28 - in the code behind ASP uses a feature
44:31 - where you can make a handler by using
44:34 - the ID underscore handle events
44:37 - signature and the code behind so awesome
44:40 - so that definitely explains a lot of
44:42 - what I was trying to guess at so sorry
44:45 - about that I should have looked over and
44:48 - saw that that would have saved me a lot
44:50 - of time so yes that's a basically what's
44:58 - what's going on here then is we can let
45:04 - me read this I get it right to explain
45:05 - this you all give it a 90 days
45:11 - it's an object alright so yeah so we can
45:20 - have the ID which was okay so we have
45:28 - button search right click so on button
45:32 - search click then it's gonna it's gonna
45:34 - run this right so and you can get the
45:39 - event so that's what's going on here
45:42 - that's how they they were connected up
45:47 - oops there we go sorry that's it okay
45:51 - yeah now I remember
45:52 - so we did end up figuring that out at
45:54 - some point because we have this on click
45:56 - of button search click right but we can
46:00 - also get right so this was the ID I'm
46:10 - not gonna scroll but I'm pretty sure
46:11 - that was the ID so Umberto was saying
46:14 - that the the ID is available as an
46:17 - object in the code behind so that's what
46:19 - we can get this txb search dot text so I
46:25 - wasn't sure how that exactly that was
46:28 - available but that's evidently yet
46:30 - that's normal for ASP so I just paid you
46:36 - okay cool that makes more sense now
46:40 - thank you Umberto let me
46:49 - right down where I left off at in the
46:52 - live chat so I can go back to it
46:58 - actually we just had a I had another
47:06 - someone had another question about the
47:08 - the link for sorry I'm trying to type
47:17 - and talk at the same time there was one
47:22 - other question about the link to the
47:24 - very first video where I talked about
47:27 - this which was I actually had done
47:28 - months ago on my channel so I'm gonna
47:33 - put that link in the live chat right now
47:34 - and I'll have to remember to put that
47:37 - into the description of the video or
47:40 - something but that link that I just
47:42 - posted in a live chat that will take you
47:44 - to the video on on my own channel where
47:46 - I introduce this website and I talked I
47:49 - kind of go through it in a lot more
47:52 - detail than I did yesterday and
47:54 - explaining what's wrong with it and what
47:57 - needs to be done alright so now let's
48:01 - get started with our other session so
48:04 - this will be our last session of coding
48:06 - and I'm bare so I'm I'm not gonna make
48:12 - the umberto recommended making a
48:14 - separate folder with its own web config
48:16 - I'm not going to do that right now
48:18 - because I think that'll be involved and
48:21 - I'll make a lot of mistakes and I don't
48:23 - so I don't have time for that so it will
48:25 - either be maybe for tomorrow stream or
48:28 - I'll try to do it before the before
48:30 - tomorrow stream
48:37 - okay so what we're gonna do so I I think
48:43 - we can so I think we can get rid of this
48:47 - oh okay we were going to we were going
48:50 - to see if we wanted to use this and I
48:56 - what I think now let me see if anyone
48:59 - else had any opinions on that
49:12 - okay so I don't think anyone had any
49:16 - opinions one way or the other but I'm
49:18 - thinking I'm Way more familiar with
49:22 - JavaScript and jQuery than I am with
49:25 - c-sharp so I'm gonna take this out and
49:28 - I'm gonna continue to use the the jQuery
49:40 - I'm just gonna I'm double checking here
49:43 - just to make sure yeah I don't think
49:51 - this is let me know especially Umberto I
49:54 - don't think that this is doing anything
49:57 - here other than basically it was doing
50:00 - the same thing that this jQuery was
50:02 - doing it was just changing the URL so
50:06 - I'll remove that we we have the the
50:08 - other copy of it so if I end up removing
50:11 - something and it really messes things up
50:13 - it will be fine
50:16 - just trying to see if we had that I
50:18 - should have done this now I already
50:21 - checked beforehand whether any you know
50:24 - the name of that anything in there was
50:27 - was elsewhere so I think we're good and
50:30 - now that I already removed this now I
50:34 - can remove this as well great I love
50:39 - when I get to remove lots of code I
50:41 - guess that wasn't a lot of code but
50:44 - still it feels good all right now what
50:47 - we need to do is give this a different
50:52 - ID so
51:00 - Seiden have so we're just gonna add side
51:03 - and have onto the end of that and then
51:07 - up here we're gonna make sure that we
51:16 - actually we're already looking at the
51:18 - text boxers
51:26 - - time suits
51:37 - all right I think this will work right
51:39 - so we were getting an error because we
51:43 - had two text box components with the
51:49 - same ID so we changed the ID but the
51:52 - jQuery was actually trying to get the
51:54 - class and it looks like everything's
51:57 - still going to work properly even if
51:59 - they have the same class which is great
52:01 - at first I thought if they were using
52:04 - IDs I would have to duplicate this which
52:08 - which wouldn't be great also we're not
52:10 - gonna we're not going to have a mobile
52:12 - search box so we can remove this and
52:17 - image search I think this is yeah this
52:26 - is a click on the icon which we don't
52:29 - have that icon anymore but let's make
52:31 - sure let me scroll down to our to our
52:38 - text box here and search icon so we're
52:46 - using the class search icon for to make
52:51 - sure we're doing it for both no actually
52:55 - we're not let's add the class
53:04 - actually I'm not sure we may have styles
53:07 - attached to that so I don't want to just
53:10 - add the search class search input well
53:23 - we're not using
53:29 - I guess we do have a search icon up here
53:31 - Oh what is this for
53:46 - I got a double check and see what I did
53:48 - with this with this navbar and I can't
53:57 - it's not this I'll just bring it up like
54:02 - three thousand and is it one yeah that's
54:08 - it all right let me see what I was
54:12 - telling here oh okay that's why I
54:14 - couldn't figure out why I had to SVG's
54:17 - it's the the clothes so I have I have
54:23 - the wrong SVG class Image Search okay
54:34 - great so I've already given this the
54:36 - right class of this image search so
54:40 - let's just make sure we use the same oh
54:46 - we are using the same class all right so
54:47 - we're already good so I had already
54:49 - taken care of that and I'd done this
54:51 - months ago so that's why I did not
54:54 - remember at all so that should still
54:55 - work so if you see we're already looking
54:57 - for that that class and then we have a
55:00 - click handler on that class to do the
55:02 - search based on that value so if enter
55:07 - is pressed so this this e which equals
55:11 - 13 that that bothers me that it's only 2
55:14 - equals I'm gonna I'm gonna fix that so
55:20 - anyway this this will work to do a
55:23 - search so enter will work a click on the
55:26 - search icon will also work and then
55:29 - search button we're not gonna have a
55:34 - separate search button so we can remove
55:38 - that as well we'll keep this here this
55:43 - check and we'll also keep this and so
55:47 - this should all work that we managed to
55:49 - remove a good bit of it and it should
55:51 - still work so let's test it out
55:56 - still getting oh I got a refresh I'm so
55:59 - used to the the auto refresh when I'm
56:03 - working locally that I keep forgetting
56:05 - let's see repeater outer Davis and once
56:16 - again I do want to keep refreshing this
56:20 - just to make sure okay great
56:22 - okay so let's see what line we're on
56:25 - Main Ave test like 33 okay so let's
56:36 - check line 30 whoops yeah
56:39 - I'm 33
56:53 - okay maybe I just my my first thought on
57:01 - this error is that since the IDS of
57:04 - things are passed automatically here is
57:07 - that something that I deleted the ID was
57:11 - being passed in and used somewhere in
57:12 - here and now that's why I'm getting the
57:14 - error so I guess I'll go through quickly
57:20 - and check this out
57:24 - scroll
57:47 - see
58:01 - I don't think I've seen anything let me
58:03 - check the live chat see if you all have
58:08 - seen anything
58:13 - okay so Umberto's saying taxonomy data
58:18 - looks like a custom class and taxonomy
58:20 - manager okay all right so you're using
58:31 - taxonomy data
58:46 - it's okay repeater outer side we did see
58:50 - this right repeater potatoes let's see
58:56 - all the places where this is just just
58:59 - to see if this maybe has something to do
59:01 - with anything
59:24 - okay
59:42 - alright here's here's what I'm gonna do
59:46 - I'm gonna check some of the things the
59:50 - classes of some of the things that I
59:52 - deleted and I'm sorry the IDS just to be
59:58 - sure
60:05 - alright no results and we didn't remove
60:15 - that hmm what did remove I don't know
60:23 - that we really removed anything to
60:28 - remove now we kept that it's double
60:33 - check
60:47 - where is it
61:01 - did I get rid of this repeater
61:03 - completely I thought I left it in and
61:09 - maybe I didn't
61:19 - okay I think that I think that's the
61:23 - reason so it's looking for for this and
61:28 - it doesn't it's not finding it so let's
61:32 - grab
61:39 - let's grab this and we'll just put it in
61:42 - here somewhere
61:50 - so we're probably gonna end up using
61:52 - this in the side nav but for now I'm
61:55 - just gonna throw it in here so that we
61:59 - quit getting the air I just want to test
62:04 - the check pucks or the the search box
62:07 - just to make sure it actually does work
62:09 - so let's see all right let me have
62:59 - okay all right so Umberto's says no
63:02 - space is that a bit yeah
63:05 - no space after the : okay I don't know
63:09 - how a space got in there that's crazy
63:13 - look at that
63:15 - how did that happen so there was no
63:18 - space in there and then when I pasted it
63:21 - there was a space really weird okay
63:25 - let's
63:34 - what the heck Oh more spaces let's make
63:40 - sure
63:54 - okay
63:56 - let's see
64:07 - all right cool I can't see the search
64:10 - bar is that okay that makes sense cuz I
64:19 - didn't bring in let's say let's see what
64:23 - the would actually get pulled in
64:34 - the heck is all that okay all right
64:50 - okay
65:13 - okay thinking maybe it's yeah there we
65:16 - go yeah
65:38 - mmm
65:51 - now where's when
65:58 - let me see what mark up I even have in
66:01 - here okay with the header
66:05 - let's go to our main file and see I mean
66:16 - the master let's see where we're pulling
66:20 - that in it Wow what should I see let's
66:32 - see the dead does
66:37 - actually I don't really like how that
66:39 - looks let's let's do it as try HTML
66:46 - that's better okay so my main content so
66:53 - our nav here we go okay our main nav
66:59 - should be in between the utility nav and
67:02 - the utility nav mobile all right
67:06 - actually we don't even want that mobile
67:08 - nav anymore
67:09 - we're just gonna have one nav so let's
67:11 - get rid of that let's get rid of that
67:17 - and I'm not sure what that utility nav
67:22 - is I'll leave it in for now but I think
67:24 - we'll probably be able to get rid of
67:25 - that as well I don't want this see
67:29 - there's a lot of this markup here menu
67:32 - buttons yeah we don't need this mobile
67:35 - search box text box oh yeah we don't
67:39 - need a lot of this yes if any
67:51 - yeah let me get rid of a lot of this
67:55 - since we don't need it
68:02 - you don't need that and yeah we don't
68:09 - need this and we actually we don't even
68:15 - need the header class yeah I think this
68:21 - is probably gonna cause errors but I
68:24 - don't need any of this stuff and then
68:28 - you container I'm getting rid of this -
68:33 - all right section gone go book on
68:37 - section yeah get rid of all of that
68:44 - there we go
68:48 - get rid of that and get rid of some of
68:55 - these spaces okay all right so you've
69:00 - got basically what we've done is there
69:04 - was a lot of markup here that is
69:07 - actually taken care of inside of this
69:09 - main nav component now so yeah main nav
69:14 - oh you know what we actually changed the
69:18 - name so that's probably a big reason why
69:21 - why this didn't work that would make
69:25 - sense so I think initially it was main
69:27 - that one and then I changed it to test
69:28 - and I never changed it in here
69:30 - so I may have made enough test tag name
69:36 - a nav okay I left it as made enough and
69:38 - for some reason it's saying may not one
69:43 - so let's put the right name in here if I
69:46 - can find it
69:54 - there you go
69:59 - well actually it doesn't matter now that
70:01 - this is the this is what matters
70:10 - okay
70:11 - so may have and I want to remove the
70:14 - things that we took out of here so that
70:15 - utility now is gone and utility that
70:22 - mobile is gone some of this other stuff
70:29 - is gonna go as well but we'll wait till
70:31 - we get to that point
70:32 - alright let's save that and see what
70:34 - kind of errors we're gonna get all right
70:39 - constant blows out to full okay
70:51 - all right so we're gonna need to get rid
70:52 - of some stuff here in our main test
70:55 - master CS file so let's check that out
70:58 - now
71:05 - all right so where we at line 40 so in
71:09 - line 40 we can get rid of this top
71:12 - header because we totally remove that
71:16 - okay and let's see yeah I'm not worried
71:28 - about that a lot of these these sections
71:31 - are so that they you can control what's
71:34 - in the header through the CMS but I
71:37 - don't need their the parts of the header
71:42 - that need to be controlled will be
71:44 - controlled but that's mainly just gonna
71:45 - be the links and that's only gonna be in
71:48 - the side nav so it's better just to take
71:52 - it out and let's see if anything else
72:01 - everything else seems like it's dealing
72:04 - with a footer
72:20 - okay all right let's try that I'm really
72:28 - surprised that how how easy it is to
72:30 - catch on to what's what's happening so
72:34 - like I said I've pretty much never used
72:38 - c-sharp before or anything dotnet other
72:42 - than me kind of messing around with it a
72:44 - few months ago but it's well you know
72:50 - they say the programming concepts the
72:52 - concepts remain the same it's just
72:54 - syntax that's that's different
72:56 - alright so I still don't see the search
73:00 - bar but I would like to check out what's
73:05 - going on over here page outer wrapper
73:13 - actually not sure why we're still
73:15 - getting that
73:23 - yeah I don't think we should be getting
73:24 - that bad menu
73:38 - okay so here is our
73:45 - interesting
74:00 - okay so basically we are getting the
74:05 - correct output on the on the screen it's
74:09 - just seems like there's some styles that
74:13 - are either conflicting or just not
74:16 - working because we didn't pull in any of
74:17 - the wow it's just oh it's probably just
74:24 - something simple that I could find in
74:27 - dev tools okay this is the on mobile
74:36 - stuff
74:47 - okay yeah we don't obviously since we
74:52 - don't have the media queries that are
74:54 - supposed to govern this probably what's
74:58 - happening is so the the desktop menu
75:06 - must be hidden somewhere I just can't
75:08 - find I can't find where it's being
75:17 - hidden I guess it would just be there we
75:27 - go show on large
75:34 - now actually now that I think about it
75:37 - none of the classes will work so I'm not
75:45 - sure I'm not worried about it it's
75:47 - showing up here that's just a matter of
75:49 - bringing in the right styles but you can
75:53 - see we are actually getting what we want
75:56 - the main thing that I'm worried about
75:57 - here is checking to see that we we can
76:02 - get that search that search bar so we're
76:10 - let's
76:23 - see where it should be
76:35 - okay so if I search input
76:43 - okay if you look for search input great
76:47 - all right so we do have an input here
76:50 - and it looks like I mean it looks good
76:56 - this looks like it has what it should
76:58 - let's see if we can bring this out
77:07 - somehow
77:16 - to play blog fixed I would say find it
77:33 - no no it's still down there
77:46 - yes
78:03 - okay all right so for whatever reason I
78:06 - can't see anything so let's go over my
78:10 - timer turned off so I'm gonna do well I
78:21 - guess that's it so we're just going to
78:22 - do two Pomodoro sessions today and I
78:27 - have an appointment in a little while
78:29 - and it's gonna take me probably a half
78:33 - hour or so to drive there so I got to
78:35 - make sure whoops my my camera's off
78:37 - again sorry about that
78:40 - so anyway I gotta make sure I'm not late
78:42 - for that that's why I extreme dab it
78:44 - earlier than normal today okay I'm gonna
78:49 - scroll back up to where I was before and
78:51 - answer as many questions as I can I
78:53 - should be able to get to them all it
78:55 - doesn't look like there's too many if
78:57 - you if you can't stick around for the
78:59 - question answer session thank you so
79:02 - much for watching I'll probably be back
79:03 - tomorrow
79:04 - around 2:00 did it freeze again already
79:10 - never unfroze I forgot to put in my
79:12 - password I keep running I keep running
79:18 - this command
79:19 - it's a pseudo kill-all VDC assistant
79:24 - every time it freezes and that makes it
79:28 - unfreeze temporarily so anyway let me
79:34 - yeah let me get to the questions if you
79:36 - have a question go ahead and put it in a
79:37 - live chat now and I should be able to
79:40 - get to it here in a few minutes okay
79:51 - okay no beer says I can't install Visual
79:54 - Studio code editor I'm using Windows 8.1
79:57 - I tried several times to install it but
80:01 - it comes up with an error help me please
80:04 - man I'm not sure I don't I don't have
80:07 - any machines that are running a Windows
80:09 - 8.1 so I've never had anything running
80:11 - it so I'm really kind of at a loss for
80:13 - how how to do things on there but
80:17 - hopefully there's somebody else here in
80:19 - the live chat that has some experience
80:21 - with it all right
80:28 - see
80:33 - okay Alberto says the bad thing about
80:35 - asp.net is that it uses a lot of post
80:38 - backs of page refreshes at least reforms
80:41 - yes I've noticed that every time I do
80:44 - have to do anything with dotnet the
80:48 - whole thing's in a form so I don't know
80:50 - if you notice this but I mean check this
80:52 - out
80:54 - or that so the whole thing is in a form
81:01 - right so let's look at that that's all
81:05 - of our content basically in this form
81:08 - it's just weird what why is it all in a
81:12 - form and then it messes it up so trying
81:17 - to do things within this form like forms
81:20 - within a form it I've always had trouble
81:24 - with this so yeah and the page refreshes
81:30 - are terrible so I much prefer you know
81:35 - sending form data with fetch or with
81:38 - Ajax you know xhr and not having a
81:43 - refresh anyway I'm sure maybe if I knew
81:49 - more about it I it wouldn't be such a
81:51 - big deal and that is probably some way
81:55 - to work with it
82:09 - Harshit says where is this site hosted
82:12 - okay it's it is hosted here on campus in
82:16 - the in a different building that I'm at
82:18 - but probably I don't know less than two
82:23 - hundred yards from me is the server that
82:26 - that hosts this website so it's actually
82:28 - hosted on servers here but hopefully
82:31 - that will change when we redo the site
82:33 - so when we rebuild it will probably
82:36 - rebuild it with react and I don't know
82:40 - what we use for content management
82:42 - maybe WordPress maybe if we can find
82:46 - something else I'd kind of prefer to
82:48 - have something you know nodejs based
82:51 - just to keep the whole stack JavaScript
82:57 - I'm like somewhat thinking about just
83:00 - making my own really lightweight CMS I
83:03 - think that would be cool but we'll see
83:06 - so anyway at that point it'll be hosted
83:10 - elsewhere so maybe I don't know maybe
83:13 - digitalocean AWS I'm really not decided
83:17 - yet as to where it'll be hosted but
83:19 - it'll be something like that
83:33 - okay I'm buried so I see now that you
83:35 - asked if I deleted the repeater yeah
83:37 - that's it and that was in fact the
83:39 - problem so sometimes I just I don't look
83:43 - over fast enough to the live chat but I
83:45 - you're pointing out what I'm what I'm
83:50 - missing even though I don't always get
83:53 - to it right away
83:53 - oh wow I'm there's embarrassing even
83:58 - gave me the line then the number is line
84:00 - 152 thank you so much again I'm sorry
84:03 - that I didn't see it
84:15 - Nicholas asked is the react to the react
84:19 - project to complete its almost complete
84:24 - I worked on just some some little stuff
84:28 - some positioning like UI positioning at
84:31 - UI elements and things the only the only
84:35 - major thing left to do is handle the
84:39 - kind of clean up the email templates a
84:41 - little bit so that an email gets sent to
84:44 - the user who submits a form and it also
84:47 - gets sent to our project manager and
84:49 - making sure that those emails look
84:52 - alright that's about it also you know
84:58 - possibly just some some testing in
84:59 - different devices and things like that
85:02 - but there's really not anything
85:04 - significant that I could do a stream
85:07 - about that I think would be really
85:09 - interesting so that's why I switched
85:10 - over to this so I'll be doing handling
85:13 - those last few things you know kind of
85:16 - earlier in the day and then I'll be
85:19 - doing this for the stream and I still
85:23 - need to get some feedback from people in
85:25 - my department about project two to see
85:28 - what they think
85:29 - see if there's any changes needed it's
85:31 - possible if something comes up that I
85:33 - think would be good to do the stream
85:36 - about then I might go back and you know
85:39 - we'll switch it up and go back to
85:41 - project two and then you know kind of go
85:43 - back and forth and then it'll be you
85:47 - know in the title of the videos it'll
85:49 - it'll say what project it is but
85:51 - basically you know at this point I
85:53 - consider it for the most part done you
85:56 - know I think it could be in in less than
86:01 - a day I think it could be in shape to
86:07 - where you'd be completely ready ready to
86:09 - go
86:24 - all right so Berto says so this ASP
86:28 - control takes a data source the results
86:30 - from a query for example as data set
86:34 - okay and generates the HTML markup for
86:39 - displaying it okay he says you could
86:45 - learn all of the attributes to set for
86:47 - it but usually people resort to using
86:49 - the designer and Visual Studio okay yet
86:53 - so I read there was a manual and Ektron
86:57 - manual that came with this content
86:59 - management system and I looked through
87:00 - it and a lot of the stuff was saying
87:03 - like use the designer in visual studio
87:05 - well I don't I don't have visual studio
87:08 - I've never used it before and I'm I'm
87:11 - just like looking at this like can I
87:13 - just edit the code so I don't know but
87:17 - to me I feel more comfortable just
87:21 - looking at the code instead of trying to
87:23 - learn a different you know editor kind
87:27 - of more like a visual editor hopefully I
87:31 - can do everything that I need to do
87:33 - without having to do that so it's my
87:37 - understanding that vision that Visual
87:41 - Studio for Mac is not the same as Visual
87:44 - Studio for Windows so it wouldn't be it
87:52 - wouldn't be a simple thing for me to get
87:53 - that I'd have to either run Windows like
87:58 - as a second operating system on my Mac
88:01 - or get a better Windows I ever really
88:04 - old Windows laptop for testing and I
88:06 - don't want to run anything on that
88:07 - because it's too slow but it's so far
88:12 - I've been able to do everything in the
88:13 - code that I wanted to do
88:29 - world boss says is dotnet better than
88:33 - JavaScript so far just from my
88:40 - experience I prefer JavaScript but I
88:43 - have very limited experience with dotnet
88:45 - so I guess just take that a
88:49 - consideration when when you hear my
88:53 - opinion on that that I'm probably not
88:56 - the best person to ask I did I haven't I
89:03 - haven't had a fun time whenever I've had
89:06 - to work with dotnet the few times that
89:08 - I've had to work with it
89:10 - I enjoy JavaScript a lot better probably
89:13 - because I know it a lot better Nicholas
89:19 - says okay project three day twos yep
89:23 - that's it so yeah the the p.3d to
89:26 - project three day two so I just decided
89:29 - to shorten it like that because
89:30 - otherwise it adds way too much length to
89:32 - the titles so hopefully it's not too
89:35 - confusing
89:43 - okay let's see so we have somebody new
89:50 - saying hi say nice to meet you but it's
89:53 - in some other characters so I don't
90:03 - really know how to say that so I'm gonna
90:04 - try to translate that
90:12 - alright so sorry if this is wrong if
90:16 - this is not really your name I use
90:18 - Google Translate to try to figure this
90:20 - out so is it Clark John Peel so
90:24 - hopefully that's your name once again
90:26 - really sorry for messing it up but so
90:27 - Park Joe until says hi nice to meet you
90:30 - says I'm so I think they say they're new
90:33 - here so but welcome thank you so much so
90:37 - much for joining us and for saying hi
90:41 - and the latch at
90:51 - okay John John Hanson was saying I
90:53 - should have should add height so when we
90:56 - were trying to find this so I'm not
90:57 - gonna go back and mess with it now but
90:59 - all I'm afterwards I'll try to get this
91:01 - to display so we can see what's going on
91:03 - there
91:14 - okay so Umberto is talking about me
91:18 - posting this stuff on a repo so that he
91:21 - can port it over to MVC so I'm I'm
91:32 - interested in that but I'm just
91:33 - wondering like is that I don't know
91:37 - enough about this to even though what's
91:38 - what's entailed in this but would that
91:42 - work within the system I mean would it
91:44 - be would it work within the Ektron
91:48 - system or would this be something
91:50 - entirely different that would replace it
91:52 - so I'm not sure but I will I'll try to
91:55 - get you the I'll try to make a repo that
92:00 - I can have public the only thing I'm
92:02 - worried about is there's a config file
92:04 - that has like usernames and passwords
92:08 - for the database so I want to make sure
92:11 - that there's no more config files with
92:13 - information like that you know hiding
92:16 - somewhere so I just need to figure it
92:20 - out for sure and then get everything
92:23 - together and then I'll make a Omega repo
92:27 - so I don't know how soon I'll be able to
92:29 - do that but I'll try to get it done you
92:32 - know maybe in the next week or two
92:53 - okay
92:59 - okay Raphael says to work with asp.net
93:02 - webforms you need Windows Plus Visual
93:06 - Studio okay so there probably is some
93:11 - stuff that I can't do or I won't be able
93:14 - to do then alright so hopefully for what
93:19 - I need to do I'll be alright but I don't
93:24 - know I guess that that's kind of good
93:26 - rationale for me maybe getting a new
93:28 - computer here at work so that would be
93:30 - kind of cool I mean I'm still gonna
93:33 - mainly develop on my Mac because I'm
93:34 - used to that I like it but it might not
93:36 - be a bad idea to have a good Windows
93:39 - machine as well we'll see if I ask they
93:44 - probably just tell me to have the new
93:46 - web developer and the IT department
93:49 - handle everything because they're
93:53 - getting the new the new web developer
93:55 - gets a new Windows PC and the Mac
94:06 - okay
94:15 - all right I've gotten to the bottom of
94:18 - the live chat so I'm gonna wrap this up
94:20 - I I wanted to say something now I'm
94:27 - forgetting oh oh I want to say this
94:31 - especially if anybody's watching
94:32 - actually our viewers have kind of
94:34 - dropped off at the end there which is
94:35 - kind of normal but I know there are some
94:38 - people that watch the show that are also
94:39 - in the react nanodegree program so
94:43 - here's a little bit of of information
94:47 - that was helpful to me you all maybe
94:50 - already know this maybe I just didn't
94:53 - read properly but I was really worried
94:56 - that my my second project the Redux
94:59 - project was due Friday so I've been
95:03 - working on it a lot lately trying to get
95:06 - it ready to turn in on Friday thinking
95:08 - that you know it's due I'm gonna like
95:11 - I'm I'm not gonna be able to finish the
95:14 - course if I don't do it well I stayed up
95:17 - last night until 4 o'clock in the
95:19 - morning working on it so from 10 from 10
95:24 - p.m. to 4 a.m. I'm working on it and
95:26 - then I'm going through the list of
95:28 - requirements and I'm thinking you know
95:30 - what there's there's still I'm not gonna
95:33 - finish this tonight there's too much
95:35 - left so I said I'm gonna look up if I
95:38 - can get an extension so I go read the
95:41 - course handbook and it turns out that
95:44 - the deadlines to submit the projects are
95:47 - actually just suggested deadlines to
95:50 - keep you on track the real deadline is
95:53 - the complete end of a nano degree
95:55 - program which I think for for my start
95:59 - time the end for me is at the beginning
96:00 - of November so really I have till the
96:04 - beginning of November to turn this thing
96:05 - in and I stayed up almost all night I
96:09 - only got three hours of sleep
96:11 - pretty much for no reason it was okay I
96:15 - mean it was really nice to get like six
96:16 - enter uninterrupted hours to just work
96:19 - on it and I feel way more comfortable
96:21 - with Redux now that I have
96:24 - and I did almost completely finish the
96:27 - project so the UI is just completely a
96:30 - mess it looks like something out of the
96:32 - 90s webpage
96:34 - I might actually leave it like that
96:35 - because I think it cool it's cool when
96:37 - it reminds me of the first websites I
96:38 - ever built but anyway I say that because
96:43 - I looked in the slack channel for the
96:45 - nanodegree and there were other people
96:46 - that had similar questions and weren't
96:48 - sure about it so I I gave them the link
96:51 - to the the place where I found that
96:53 - information so I'm just I'm thinking
96:55 - it's possible that there might be
96:56 - somebody watching this that that might
97:00 - might not know like I did so don't freak
97:04 - out you don't have to turn things in you
97:07 - know on the on the due date
97:09 - it's just suggested so but I do really
97:11 - want to get the project finished soon
97:13 - and move on because the next project is
97:14 - going to be react native and I've never
97:16 - done anything with react native but I'm
97:18 - really excited about it
97:19 - I just I don't know I think that's
97:21 - really cool it'll be awesome
97:23 - for me to have something on my phone an
97:25 - app that I made I don't know that just
97:28 - seems really exciting to me
97:31 - websites are cool too but like I've been
97:33 - doing websites for a long time so that's
97:35 - just it's lost some of the excitement
97:41 - like just the the wow factor of doing it
97:44 - the novelty has worn off but anyway so
97:48 - I'm sorry to go on about that I just
97:51 - wanted to try to be helpful okay Ally
97:58 - asked what is the react nanodegree okay
98:03 - so it's um okay alice has found it okay
98:09 - yeah it's says founded it's pretty
98:13 - expensive yes it's it's it was expensive
98:18 - it was sometimes they have deals and you
98:21 - can get it for cheaper but when I got it
98:23 - there wasn't any like deal or anything
98:25 - there was no discount
98:26 - so it was $500 which when I think about
98:30 - it now I'm like why did I spend $500 on
98:34 - that I wish I had $500 now
98:38 - but at the time I had recently completed
98:40 - a project and I just got a big check
98:42 - from a client so I was spending like I
98:44 - was rich and so it didn't bother me and
98:51 - but I think it's it's been really useful
98:55 - so far so I think it will end up being
98:58 - worth it I'll probably be a while before
99:02 - I do another nanodegree because it is a
99:04 - lot of work and money but this was been
99:08 - really useful so far I think I'm gonna
99:11 - do maybe a review like video after I'm
99:14 - all done with it and just kind of go
99:16 - over like what I thought and what I
99:17 - learned and maybe that'll help other
99:20 - people decide whether or not they
99:22 - actually want to pay you know the $500
99:24 - to do it as well okay I just see Ali
99:29 - said would you say it was worth it yet
99:32 - so far like I said it would be nice to
99:36 - have have five hundred dollars right now
99:38 - but that I paid for that but so far it's
99:41 - been worth it and I'm I'm not even
99:44 - through the the core so I've
99:46 - learned a lot and I've been able to use
99:48 - what I've learned in my projects for
99:50 - work and it's helped me a lot for those
99:53 - projects so like I learned about react
99:56 - router in the nanodegree program and I
100:02 - immediately started using react router
100:04 - on my projects so that was that was very
100:08 - useful and I think I'll probably end up
100:11 - using Redux and one of my upcoming react
100:13 - projects so that'll be useful as well
100:16 - and I'm not really sure what kind of app
100:21 - I'll build but I'm sure I'll figure
100:22 - something out to try to use react native
100:25 - I don't want to lose what I'm learning
100:26 - so I really want to try to implement the
100:28 - stuff that I'm learning in real projects
100:31 - and just keep using it otherwise if I
100:34 - wait a couple months I'll probably
100:35 - forget a lot of what I've learned and
100:37 - and then it would be more of a waste and
100:39 - it wouldn't be the fault of the people
100:41 - who made an Anna
100:42 - would be my own fault yes races you can
100:48 - learn all those things from a book as
100:49 - well and faster yeah yeah you can
100:52 - there's definitely a difference the one
100:55 - difference that I've noticed from the
100:56 - nanodegree program that you don't get in
100:59 - a book is the code reviews so there's
101:04 - live help so I can just ask questions
101:08 - and have people look at my code just
101:11 - live and help me with parts of it and
101:13 - then when my project is you know at a
101:15 - complete point where I think it's
101:17 - finished I turn it in and then people
101:19 - review my code and offer suggestions
101:21 - like line by line suggestions for how I
101:24 - could improve it and that's where I
101:27 - think the benefit is because you're
101:29 - right the actual information I mean you
101:32 - can get that wherever you can just read
101:34 - the docs and I actually did I ended up
101:36 - reading through a lot of the redux
101:38 - documentation and then I really
101:40 - understood it a lot better I mean the
101:43 - course was nice too but you get I got a
101:46 - lot out of the docs as well so yeah and
101:51 - I guess actually I don't ever really use
101:53 - books so when I you can't get it from
101:57 - books but I just get it from websites
101:59 - like what why buy a book when you have
102:03 - more up-to-date information online for
102:06 - free you know not to say like I'm sure
102:10 - there are really good books out there as
102:12 - well I just prefer reading it or
102:15 - watching a video but anyway also like
102:22 - the motivation of having deadlines is
102:25 - nice of having these projects and like
102:28 - clear goals is really nice you know if
102:32 - you're really self-motivated you don't
102:34 - really you don't need that but I'm
102:36 - really busy between my full-time job and
102:38 - my
102:39 - clients on the side and my four kids and
102:41 - my wife I need some like goals and some
102:45 - pressure to force myself to learn things
102:48 - you know on my own time and outside of
102:51 - work so that's good for me
102:54 - in terms of making sure that I do it
102:56 - because I I don't want to I don't want
102:59 - to not finish a class that I paid $500
103:01 - for so there's definitely pressure to
103:04 - make it worthwhile but I wouldn't have
103:05 - if it was just me I would probably just
103:10 - put it off and you know so there's
103:13 - definitely benefits to doing it but it
103:16 - definitely depends on your learning
103:17 - style and your own motivation the one
103:22 - thing too about so Shave mentioned you
103:24 - can go faster the one thing too is I
103:27 - mean this react nanodegree it's not like
103:29 - a normal like a typical classroom
103:30 - setting so you do go at your own pace so
103:33 - in terms of speed you're totally in
103:36 - control of how fast you go through the
103:38 - lessons and how fast you build the
103:40 - projects but in a traditional classroom
103:44 - I do agree that it's it's definitely way
103:48 - slower than you could do if you're
103:49 - learning on your on your own for most
103:52 - people well Ali said books are also out
104:00 - of date as soon as they are published I
104:02 - would think that the course gets updated
104:03 - the course actually has been updated a
104:06 - lot since I started which is surprising
104:09 - so so that's cool I mean that's it's
104:13 - actually it's good and bad for me cuz
104:15 - I'm in like the very first class that
104:17 - started so the first day it came out I
104:19 - started so we're I'm going through and
104:22 - as people find bugs they get fixed but
104:25 - I'm already passed those lessons so
104:27 - sometimes I see where they'll say they
104:30 - fixed all this stuff and I'm like whoa I
104:32 - already I already figured it out you
104:34 - know there's some things that were just
104:36 - a little buggy at first and you just had
104:38 - to kind of work around it so but they
104:42 - they progressively keep getting better
104:43 - as more people go through the course so
104:45 - that's really cool
104:50 - okay oh sure a says what about like
104:55 - stackoverflow ready yeah i like to learn
104:57 - from stackoverflow I don't really go on
104:59 - reddit often and then you know there's
105:04 - other good online resources so there's a
105:05 - lot of great YouTube channels and then
105:08 - right obviously free code camp is great
105:10 - and there's um just looking at code
105:17 - reading the documentation for the things
105:19 - that I'm using is is really helpful
105:22 - looking at other people's code on github
105:24 - and there are some good like online
105:29 - books like the the you don't know Jas
105:32 - series is great and it's all available
105:34 - for free on github so I think there's
105:38 - there's a lot of there's a lot of great
105:40 - free resources out there but for me at
105:45 - least at this point in my life with
105:48 - everything I have going on this is
105:50 - probably the fastest way that I was
105:53 - going to learn more about react and
105:55 - redux and react native it worked for me
105:59 - in the past when I had let's say more
106:02 - time and less money that wouldn't have
106:06 - been the right choice for me but for
106:09 - right now I mean I'm not saying I have a
106:10 - lot of money but at the time I happened
106:14 - to be able to spare that money so and
106:16 - still be able to pay my bills so alright
106:22 - so let me okay I have another there's
106:27 - another question sure I asked hey are
106:30 - you interested in Android programming
106:32 - I've been into that lately but I've also
106:34 - been interested in react native I'm not
106:36 - interested in directly programming
106:38 - Android so I'm very interested in react
106:40 - native but I'm not I'm not interested in
106:42 - learning how to do you know for instance
106:45 - like to do Java or Kotlin for Android or
106:48 - Swift for iOS I think iOS is still Swift
106:51 - I'm not as interested in that I'd rather
106:54 - I only have so much time to learn
106:56 - just focus on JavaScript and try to get
106:59 - as good as I can with that then to know
107:01 - like a little bit about a lot of
107:03 - different languages that makes sense for
107:06 - me in my career right now
107:08 - I'm not opposed to switching I'm not
107:10 - against other languages it just so
107:12 - happens that I've already come so far
107:14 - with JavaScript that it I think it would
107:19 - just be better for me at this point just
107:20 - to keep going with it
107:26 - smilers asked that you have ite
107:29 - education not formal so I mean I took I
107:34 - took a programming class a C++
107:37 - programming class in college but other
107:40 - than that I don't have any formal
107:42 - education and this has all been kind of
107:45 - self-taught through almost exclusively
107:49 - free online resources with the exception
107:52 - of this nano degree program and maybe
107:53 - like one course I bought from udemy that
107:56 - was I think it was on sale for like 10
107:58 - bucks so other than that though it's
108:01 - it's been all free resources and just
108:03 - kind of learning as I picked up clients
108:05 - and learning what I need to do to
108:07 - complete their projects okay
108:13 - Oh James sorry I missed your question
108:15 - earlier I saw it then I forgot about it
108:16 - so James asks about tablets for coding
108:20 - so saying can i code with a tablet if so
108:23 - what would you suggest you guys see like
108:27 - for instance the surface pro 3 I don't
108:29 - have experience with that so I don't
108:32 - know that I could be that helpful for
108:33 - you I know there there are some tablets
108:36 - that come with a keyboard
108:37 - I would think ideally like you would
108:39 - want that right or I just can't imagine
108:42 - trying to to do a lot of programming on
108:46 - a tablet without a dedicated keyboard
108:49 - maybe even a mouse so if I were looking
108:53 - for a tablet that I could code on
108:55 - probably the biggest things for me would
108:57 - be like is it powerful enough obviously
109:01 - you're gonna probably want to use some
109:02 - sort of like cloud development
109:06 - that'll run in the browser so but you
109:11 - just I would just kind of want to make
109:13 - sure that it's powerful enough to run
109:14 - that and not be too slow and then that
109:16 - it's I could easily hook up a keyboard
109:19 - and mouse but other than that I don't
109:23 - have any like hands-on experience you
109:26 - know with using a tablet of to code okay
109:37 - I think I've gotten through all the
109:39 - questions now okay all right so I've
109:48 - been through other questions now and
109:50 - that's good because I'm gonna have to
109:51 - leave soon
109:52 - for my my den I have a dentist
109:54 - appointment today so I have to leave
109:57 - soon to go see my dentist and all right
110:01 - so awesome so this will end up being a
110:03 - longer video than I anticipated but we
110:06 - did some good work we got some we got a
110:08 - lot done it may not seem like that much
110:11 - to look at it actually looks worse than
110:12 - when we started but behind the scenes we
110:15 - worked through a lot of errors got a lot
110:17 - done I'm really excited about this I
110:18 - feel like I'm I'm finally starting to
110:21 - wrap my head around what's going on here
110:23 - and this is good I think we'll be able
110:26 - to do a lot to make this homepage you
110:29 - know a lot faster and just a much better
110:32 - UI and so I'm excited I'm really excited
110:37 - about this this would be cool at least
110:39 - for me a lot of people will notice this
110:42 - change this would be a big change so
110:43 - that'll be fun to see what would people
110:46 - around here at the university think
110:47 - about it
110:48 - so probably be back tomorrow around 2:00
110:52 - p.m. Eastern time I'll let you know for
110:55 - sure what time on Twitter so you can
110:58 - follow me on Twitter if you like or if
111:00 - you subscribe to this channel you should
111:02 - get an alert at some point when I
111:04 - scheduled the livestream so you know
111:07 - either one of those two so you know one
111:11 - of those two avenues will
111:12 - we'll get you the time of the stream and
111:17 - yeah thank you so much for watching
111:19 - thank you for helping out in the live
111:21 - chat a lot a lot of good advice and good
111:24 - help and especially thanks to Umberto
111:27 - offered a lot of help and was very
111:29 - patient with me really not knowing what
111:31 - I was doing so I appreciate that that
111:34 - was awesome that you were very patient
111:38 - and kind about telling me when I when I
111:41 - was doing something wrong so again thank
111:46 - you and have a great day I'll see
111:49 - everyone tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jesse and in this stream you all can watch me would do my daytoday work I'm just a frontend developer to university and this is not scripted at all and so I'll make mistakes and try to work through them and hopefully we can help each other and and learn together so today we're gonna continue with what we were doing yesterday and that is trying to turn this header into something that looks like this so today I think we'll we'll just work on this header portion we'll save the side nav for another day because I don't think we'll get through it all in one stream the main site that the main goal is to make this site run more quickly so we'll load it up here not bad that was a little bit faster than usual the internet connection is good here and this site is hosted on campus so shouldn't be too much of a round trip but you can see the current site this is gonna change significantly we went over a lot of the changes in yesterday stream so if you missed that you could check that out probably and it'll be in the first half of that stream so this is a copy of that page with most of the stuff removed so I haven't done that much since yesterday let me show you what I did do so yesterday one of the last things we did was make a test version of this main nav component and we had it connected to the main nav dot cs5 whoops and I just noticed I put two dots in there so let's let's rename that now before before it messes something up sorry about that my phone's ringing I don't recognize the number so I'm just gonna let it go okay so now that has the correct name and what we've done is we've brought imported this in here as maintenance so the reason I did that is because I was looking through this a little bit and there were some areas where I thought we may want to change the mark up like for instance you know we do have some you know some HTML you know that we may want to change so I figured you know I may as well make a test page you know first if if you weren't watching yesterday an important thing to know about this project is that this file structure that you just saw a second ago here these are the live files for the site so there is no test site there's there is something that they call a test site but it shares all the same files so I'm not really sure what what about it is a test site I think maybe it has a different database but so that's why we have to make copies test copies of all these files before we make anything go alive all right so let me check out the live chat just say hello to everyone before we get started hey everybody alright so the way I divide up things in this stream is with a Pomodoro timer so I'm gonna start this and we're gonna do 25 minutes of coding and then I'll do five minutes of answering questions in the live chat and I'll check back in periodically during the coding into live chat especially if I need some help or you know if I if I get to a point where I think someone might have something to say then I'll check back over there but otherwise if you ask a question during that 25minute period just hang in there and I'll do my best to get to it during the five minutes after we do probably about two Pomodoro sessions then I'll take the end of the stream and answer any questions that are left over that I didn't get to so if you could stick around to the end your question will be answered eventually and if you can't stick around to the end go ahead and ask it anyway and then you can catch the recording later on it's also not a bad idea just ask a question whenever I am coding and there are a lot of people in the live chat that are so knowledgeable more knowledgeable than me and on a lot of things and they can help you out as well okay so let's get started I think I saw some new some new names I haven't seen before in the live chat so if you're new welcome thank you so much for for joining joining in the live chat and for watching alright let's get started well one thing that we're definitely going to have to do is change the structure of this of this navbar I mean this is the HTML was significantly different so that's what we'll work on first I'm also using materialize the materialized CSS framework to do this so we're gonna bring that in I'm so I'm hesitant to bring in another framework on a site that's already really slow but we're already loading jQuery so we're not adding anything by using a framework that's going to need jQuery as well and we can't get rid of it there's just too much on the site already that's using it so since we already have jQuery I think it'll be all right what we'll probably end up doing is after we get everything looking how we want we can go through the materialized JavaScript and CSS and remove anything that we're not using and get those file sizes down you know as small as we can but I think the benefit of being able to use a lot of the things that are built in to to materialize is is do not outweigh our you know any you know slight increase I think you know in load times you know it'll be it'll be minimal okay this is also officially project three now in the video so in the titles of the videos I'll I'll put in parentheses at the end of each title it'll be p3 for project three and then I'll put D this is day two so it's D two that way it'll be a little bit easier to keep up I'll probably make a playlist once I get a few more videos I'll make a playlist specifically for this project this project we may have to work on a little bit and then do some other stuff and then maybe come back to it you know this is a really large site it's going to be an ongoing project I'm gonna move this over to my other screen and I'm also gonna move this over because dev tools is probably going to be more useful at this point and also my my editors so at first let me grab let me get Adam also I finally figured out four on project two I figured out how to position that I that checkbox icon so if anybody's interested in how I did that just ask it in the live chat and I'll get to it during one of the question questionandanswer sessions so it actually it took me three times as long as I estimated that it would take it was quite frustrating but I finally got it to the point where it it works and it looks the way I wanted to look okay so here's the Trello board for this project a lot of stuff going on here I'm not sure if I even have one for the header right now I'm not gonna worry about this now the reason I scrolled over was to get to this so this is the the project that you just saw the the goal header right how we want it to look so I want to grab the markup for that that nav from here bring it over and then we'll go from there and trying to plug in the data from the content management system and the the CMS that we're using is called Ektron it's it's pretty old so we'll see how it works we're just gonna have to learn it as we you know how things are put together as we go along alright that's the side now we're not gonna mess with the side nav right now okay so I think this should be it if we just grab this nav element and we can double check mmm actually we're gonna need we need this div as well we need to grab the entire header let's bring over the entire header we're gonna need to do it at some point anyway so you may as well do it now like I said we're not really gonna work on the side nav for now mmhmm that's interesting I think I can safely take that out everything's working it's been commented out for a while okay I was just thinking we could potentially split this up into two different components but I I think it'll be easier to start out with just to put it all in the main nav component and then if we we feel like it's too much at some point we can always split it out at that point okay so now that we have that we shouldn't really need to come back to this except maybe to grab maybe some some of the materialized code I want to see where I'm loading this if I'm using a CDN or not okay so I am importing the JavaScript from a CDN but I want to get the latest version so we can just go on materialized and figure out where the latest versions are okay so let's go I'm gonna leave this in for now and we're just gonna have to edit this to make it work with with our search bugs all right I think hmm alright all of this is commented out I'm gonna get rid of this because we can always refer to it in the version the nontest version of this in case there's something that something in here that would be useful to us but for now I'm just gonna get rid of all of this yeah we're just gonna get rid of the nav I guess we can't I want to keep some of this down here so this this template so everything inside this repeater I do want to keep for now just to reference it but all of this can go let me know if the font size is big enough area okay so that's everything and I should be able to paste the the indentation on this is not great let's bring it back a bit so I'm using Visual Studio code for this which I don't normally use so it's that's a little bit of a different feel to it so I'm still kind of getting used to that all right let's see all right so let's paste this in now and so we do have some of the header and the nav so we can get rid of we can get rid of this nav and I guess this ul I guess Oh worry about indentation later I'm gonna take that out it's comment it out so probably don't need it and that's where it's it was closed we'll take that out as well and here's our huge side nav okay this is what I wanted so now we got down to here let's take take these two out since we deleted deleted them up there these are just closing text what will be deleted and let's grab you know what let's remove this and we'll just pull up the other version of this the live version and then we can put it over here and and just look look on refer to it on that side so let me bring this okay alright let me scroll down good so this is what we we want to bring in this repeater and then there's a template for our for our links in here so we kind of just want to break this down try to figure out what's going on and what data is being imported hopefully the names are gonna be descriptive enough that we'll be able to tell what's you know what's going on we may have to just kind of look around a bit and refer to the site and and figure it out but we should have all the data that we need you know just from these from this template basically to populate our new nav so the the social media I think I mentioned this yesterday all the social media links we're just going to keep them as is and we'll just hard code the URLs I think right now there's yeah I don't even have URLs in there right now so we will hard code those in there and I'm okay with that let's see what we really want we really need to worry about pulling in dynamically or these links the donate button can be hard coded and probably these ones these ones can be are coded this about academics admissions faith life those are not likely to change it's more these she's interior links actually these aren't likely to change it may be a lot easier than I thought to put in the new header will be the tricky part as the side now so we may actually get get to the side enough we'll see we'll see how tough it is to get this header working you know we still still haven't even tested it we do need to hook up this search input so we need to see how it's working here and try to pull in all the same values and see if it can work here as well so actually bringing in this text box search I'm checking the I'm just shade a live chat briefly okay I think this is probably we're gonna have to find this because I want to make sure that's interesting I must have I must have opened up the site in dev tools and pulled in the names from into there which was okay and would normally work but I'd rather pull it in here since we can get these values kind of more directly so let's try to find this textbox let's see let me get out of mode so I can get it to here so what was that called again it was the text text box let's see if we can find it okay this is some of the search stuff but not not the text box okay I was hoping it was in there but I don't think it is so let's see where else hmm I want to check out what gets what the output of this is if it's just simply an input then we don't really need to know anything else so and that'll be fine is we'll just put in these these values so let's look at the site in dev tools then alright so this is the inputs let me make sure whoops alright so it is this day of his header search so within that div yes all we have is just the input great alright then we don't really need to find out where this textbox is coming from let's just plug in these values that we need so probably the easiest thing will be to just copy this whole thing and paste it in there and we'll make sure we add the right class names for our styles to work so we want the placeholder I guess it can be can be searched with the dots that's fine name search type search class okay that looks good I actually don't really have any any other class name so this will be perfect okay great and that should be it the search should work now you can see there's nothing else you know being pulled in here this is just plain HTML the same way with this this icon here so all this should be fine great now while we're doing this we should probably put it in the side nav as well since I'm I have a search input in the side nav so let me double check to see if I have anything different going on I don't think so so let's put that in there as well all right now that's ready and those should work we could actually I wonder what this looks like now that we've been kind of messing around with it put it up pull with put this on another screen okay we're definitely getting some errors here let me pull this over to show you the areas that we're getting I do want to double check and make sure that none of those errors are are bleeding over into the main site okay good it still loads the site's really buggy so sometimes I'll change something that seems like it should be fine and not affect anything I mean just extremely simple things will be changed and large portions of the site will just go down and display something like this so I want to be really careful about you know doublechecking this is our main website it you know it gets a lot of traffic you know in the millions of visits there going on a yearly basis you know millions so it's by far the most visited of all the sites that that I work on here for the University so you know realistically if that if I accidentally took the site down potentially we could lose money from donors and from potential students so it's worth the caution all right so let's see an error occurred it's already used by another control oh okay maybe we are gonna have a problem since we have things with the same ID yeah it could be a problem what ID did we have before let me check this yes folks we're gonna have to think think about what we want to do then for the search actually let's let's check this out right now I think there is a like a mobile search so I'm interested to see what what happens there so let's shrink this down and click search and let's see if it's the same input or what's going on there is there an ID I'm not seeing an idea at all okay so it's mobile search box mobile search placeholder search I tell you what I'm gonna do what I think might be the simplest thing just to test this out would be just to change the ID and yeah we'll just change the ID and see what happens and see if we can get it to work we should be able to check yeah if what we could possibly do is just have to two functions here and this is in I believe csharp I don't have very much experience at all the C sharp so if I'm messing up any terminology I apologize and please let me know what with the the right way to talk about this stuff is all right so let me search clear okay I'm just checking to see if these exist somewhere else in in the same file I'm just not sure how how these link up where did this come from that's just okay so that's just hanging out at the end here interesting hmm yeah I'm not exactly sure how rights to the on click that's firing off this function its button search click the on click handler is down here on this button with the class button search but this is what's actually visible to the user so I'm just trying to figure out how these are linked up interesting let me I want to check to see if there's okay okay here this is that button and we can see it's not there's there's nothing it's um it's not visible hmm you know what I bet the answer's up here I had forgotten that there was some code up at the top some JavaScript so we'll see okay so they're grabbing the textbook search so this key press 13 I think is enter so if they're gonna hit enter then it's going to okay then it's gonna just click using jQuery it's going to click the button search alright interesting so they have a hidden submit button and they're just using jQuery to make that button get clicked that works I definitely I don't think I would do it that way but I'm not upset about it because I understand what's going on so so that's good where's actually this is interesting too they have this commented out where's this function it looks like they changed it okay my timer went off so I'm gonna do my five minutes of a question answer in just a second but I just wanted to see if you all see this it's really interesting let me switch this to JavaScript for a minute we get some highlighting here we go and that'll be a lot easier actually this is not bad let's see how that's I might just leave it as JavaScript highlighting because that looks pretty good so if you check this out so our button search click it's at one point it seems like maybe this was the way they had set it up and then they changed their minds which which makes sense like I said this is not the way I would have done it but they changed their minds and they grabbed the value and then run this function to do the search and it's actually changing the URL of the page and then just adding the search value as a query string right at the end of the URL so that's how they decided to do the search so really we can get rid of we can get rid of all this stuff that's not in use and just kind of make this smaller clean it up we can also get rid of that button and now that we know how this works it really doesn't matter much what we're going to do with that mobile search because the search essentially is just it seems like it's all taken care of here I want to double check all right when we come back from the five minute break for questions the first thing I want to do is well I want to remove this button our test file but then also in our CS file I really I want to look at this and try to figure out what's going on and if this is even being called at all because I think the answer is no I think that this is not even in use so that we could also remove this and yeah we could remove this or potentially we could get rid of a lot of this jQuery and then make use of this I'm not sure what the best one is but let me know anybody especially that knows more about you know kind of dotnet stuff than I do which is probably anybody that knows anything about death let me know what do you think the best way to do this would be it may not matter what is it better to use jQuery to change the location and we could refactor this and not use jQuery if we really wanted to but I think we're gonna we're gonna need it for other places on the site so I don't think it would be useful to get rid of it or is it better to do it like this yeah look let me know what you think so let me start boobs I'm gonna start my fiveminute timer I'm gonna do whoops sorry my camera first I just just now saw that yeah so if you remember if you're watching yesterday you know my camera kept freezing and I had to just restart it this is just the builtin camera on my iMac monitor so um I don't know what to do about it we'll see if it keeps doing this and it's a problem all I might just get another camera alright so I'm just going up to the top of the live chat I'm gonna run through and just try to find the questions and get as many as I can in Abdullah Abdullah not exactly sure how you pronounce the end of that so sorry that says what's the best laptop for coding yeah it depends on what operating system you like to use which is so smoke one says also mentions that depends on your operating system I really like a my macbook pro I think it's great to work on it starts up it's fast it has good battery life I've been less than impressed with a lot of the Windows laptops that I've had before but I don't think it's a fair comparison because I've never bought a Windows laptop that would that was as expensive as a macbook pro so if I were to buy a Windows laptop that was that expensive maybe it would be as good or better I'm not sure i've never used Linux on a laptop so I don't know but my next laptop purchase you know for my own personal use is probably going to be Linux I'd really like to try it out but I do have a MacBook I think it's like a 15inch MacBook Pro and it was the last model that still had the the HDMI connection and that's been really useful for me because so many things hook up through HDMI so I really like that I don't remember what year that is maybe 2015 or something like that so the newer models have that that touch bar thing which that's pretty cool too but I think everything's done through USB see connectors so for right now it's somewhat of a problem because you know a lot of your older things don't don't use the USB see so you need a lot of adapters then anyway that's my as my thoughts on it not really technical but those are just some of my observations no Bo says Jessie can you give us the code that you have local on localhost yeah so let's see I figure you're probably talking about was that I've lost that that here you know anyway I'm pretty sure you were talking about that example site that we were that I was showing and I do have that code available so let me find the repo for you so I remember what the name of it is okay so here's the repository so I haven't done this is just the initial I just wanted to put this on github so you all have it so here it is I am I definitely wanna update materialized because this is using an older version so I want to update that that'll probably one of the first things I do to change this and then we're also going to be developing a lot of the UI elements here because we can make use of my local development environment will develop it here and then transfer it over into the test versions the test files that we have for the actual site and plug in the values that we need you know into the templates so we'll basically convert these into templates that will work on the site but it's going to be a lot faster to get them to look how we want them to look here locally and then move them over so that'll kind of be the the workflow we'll just switch over and try to go you know one component at a time but I will put this in the live chat and actually I just saw Umberto has a bunch of comments so I'm assuming I did something wrong usually when I see a lot of comments like that it means I did did something wrong so let me see all the web forms suggestions okay so let me let me read a little bit of what Umberto said because it's definitely it it's useful and it pertains to you know a lot so if you don't know from being in the live chat Umberto he knows about csharp and he's actually doing his own YouTube videos so about that which I may be watching those I want to watch them anyway but now I may really want to be watching them so that I can can know how about having to work on this project alright so let me read out what he said so he said basically said you might really want to create a separate folder with its own web config and remove the custom errors from the main web config when you add an SP control and give it an ID that ID is available as an object in the code behind ASP uses a feature where you can make a handler by using the ID underscore handle events signature and the code behind so awesome so that definitely explains a lot of what I was trying to guess at so sorry about that I should have looked over and saw that that would have saved me a lot of time so yes that's a basically what's what's going on here then is we can let me read this I get it right to explain this you all give it a 90 days it's an object alright so yeah so we can have the ID which was okay so we have button search right click so on button search click then it's gonna it's gonna run this right so and you can get the event so that's what's going on here that's how they they were connected up oops there we go sorry that's it okay yeah now I remember so we did end up figuring that out at some point because we have this on click of button search click right but we can also get right so this was the ID I'm not gonna scroll but I'm pretty sure that was the ID so Umberto was saying that the the ID is available as an object in the code behind so that's what we can get this txb search dot text so I wasn't sure how that exactly that was available but that's evidently yet that's normal for ASP so I just paid you okay cool that makes more sense now thank you Umberto let me right down where I left off at in the live chat so I can go back to it actually we just had a I had another someone had another question about the the link for sorry I'm trying to type and talk at the same time there was one other question about the link to the very first video where I talked about this which was I actually had done months ago on my channel so I'm gonna put that link in the live chat right now and I'll have to remember to put that into the description of the video or something but that link that I just posted in a live chat that will take you to the video on on my own channel where I introduce this website and I talked I kind of go through it in a lot more detail than I did yesterday and explaining what's wrong with it and what needs to be done alright so now let's get started with our other session so this will be our last session of coding and I'm bare so I'm I'm not gonna make the umberto recommended making a separate folder with its own web config I'm not going to do that right now because I think that'll be involved and I'll make a lot of mistakes and I don't so I don't have time for that so it will either be maybe for tomorrow stream or I'll try to do it before the before tomorrow stream okay so what we're gonna do so I I think we can so I think we can get rid of this oh okay we were going to we were going to see if we wanted to use this and I what I think now let me see if anyone else had any opinions on that okay so I don't think anyone had any opinions one way or the other but I'm thinking I'm Way more familiar with JavaScript and jQuery than I am with csharp so I'm gonna take this out and I'm gonna continue to use the the jQuery I'm just gonna I'm double checking here just to make sure yeah I don't think this is let me know especially Umberto I don't think that this is doing anything here other than basically it was doing the same thing that this jQuery was doing it was just changing the URL so I'll remove that we we have the the other copy of it so if I end up removing something and it really messes things up it will be fine just trying to see if we had that I should have done this now I already checked beforehand whether any you know the name of that anything in there was was elsewhere so I think we're good and now that I already removed this now I can remove this as well great I love when I get to remove lots of code I guess that wasn't a lot of code but still it feels good all right now what we need to do is give this a different ID so Seiden have so we're just gonna add side and have onto the end of that and then up here we're gonna make sure that we actually we're already looking at the text boxers time suits all right I think this will work right so we were getting an error because we had two text box components with the same ID so we changed the ID but the jQuery was actually trying to get the class and it looks like everything's still going to work properly even if they have the same class which is great at first I thought if they were using IDs I would have to duplicate this which which wouldn't be great also we're not gonna we're not going to have a mobile search box so we can remove this and image search I think this is yeah this is a click on the icon which we don't have that icon anymore but let's make sure let me scroll down to our to our text box here and search icon so we're using the class search icon for to make sure we're doing it for both no actually we're not let's add the class actually I'm not sure we may have styles attached to that so I don't want to just add the search class search input well we're not using I guess we do have a search icon up here Oh what is this for I got a double check and see what I did with this with this navbar and I can't it's not this I'll just bring it up like three thousand and is it one yeah that's it all right let me see what I was telling here oh okay that's why I couldn't figure out why I had to SVG's it's the the clothes so I have I have the wrong SVG class Image Search okay great so I've already given this the right class of this image search so let's just make sure we use the same oh we are using the same class all right so we're already good so I had already taken care of that and I'd done this months ago so that's why I did not remember at all so that should still work so if you see we're already looking for that that class and then we have a click handler on that class to do the search based on that value so if enter is pressed so this this e which equals 13 that that bothers me that it's only 2 equals I'm gonna I'm gonna fix that so anyway this this will work to do a search so enter will work a click on the search icon will also work and then search button we're not gonna have a separate search button so we can remove that as well we'll keep this here this check and we'll also keep this and so this should all work that we managed to remove a good bit of it and it should still work so let's test it out still getting oh I got a refresh I'm so used to the the auto refresh when I'm working locally that I keep forgetting let's see repeater outer Davis and once again I do want to keep refreshing this just to make sure okay great okay so let's see what line we're on Main Ave test like 33 okay so let's check line 30 whoops yeah I'm 33 okay maybe I just my my first thought on this error is that since the IDS of things are passed automatically here is that something that I deleted the ID was being passed in and used somewhere in here and now that's why I'm getting the error so I guess I'll go through quickly and check this out scroll see I don't think I've seen anything let me check the live chat see if you all have seen anything okay so Umberto's saying taxonomy data looks like a custom class and taxonomy manager okay all right so you're using taxonomy data it's okay repeater outer side we did see this right repeater potatoes let's see all the places where this is just just to see if this maybe has something to do with anything okay alright here's here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna check some of the things the classes of some of the things that I deleted and I'm sorry the IDS just to be sure alright no results and we didn't remove that hmm what did remove I don't know that we really removed anything to remove now we kept that it's double check where is it did I get rid of this repeater completely I thought I left it in and maybe I didn't okay I think that I think that's the reason so it's looking for for this and it doesn't it's not finding it so let's grab let's grab this and we'll just put it in here somewhere so we're probably gonna end up using this in the side nav but for now I'm just gonna throw it in here so that we quit getting the air I just want to test the check pucks or the the search box just to make sure it actually does work so let's see all right let me have okay all right so Umberto's says no space is that a bit yeah no space after the okay I don't know how a space got in there that's crazy look at that how did that happen so there was no space in there and then when I pasted it there was a space really weird okay let's what the heck Oh more spaces let's make sure okay let's see all right cool I can't see the search bar is that okay that makes sense cuz I didn't bring in let's say let's see what the would actually get pulled in the heck is all that okay all right okay okay thinking maybe it's yeah there we go yeah mmm now where's when let me see what mark up I even have in here okay with the header let's go to our main file and see I mean the master let's see where we're pulling that in it Wow what should I see let's see the dead does actually I don't really like how that looks let's let's do it as try HTML that's better okay so my main content so our nav here we go okay our main nav should be in between the utility nav and the utility nav mobile all right actually we don't even want that mobile nav anymore we're just gonna have one nav so let's get rid of that let's get rid of that and I'm not sure what that utility nav is I'll leave it in for now but I think we'll probably be able to get rid of that as well I don't want this see there's a lot of this markup here menu buttons yeah we don't need this mobile search box text box oh yeah we don't need a lot of this yes if any yeah let me get rid of a lot of this since we don't need it you don't need that and yeah we don't need this and we actually we don't even need the header class yeah I think this is probably gonna cause errors but I don't need any of this stuff and then you container I'm getting rid of this all right section gone go book on section yeah get rid of all of that there we go get rid of that and get rid of some of these spaces okay all right so you've got basically what we've done is there was a lot of markup here that is actually taken care of inside of this main nav component now so yeah main nav oh you know what we actually changed the name so that's probably a big reason why why this didn't work that would make sense so I think initially it was main that one and then I changed it to test and I never changed it in here so I may have made enough test tag name a nav okay I left it as made enough and for some reason it's saying may not one so let's put the right name in here if I can find it there you go well actually it doesn't matter now that this is the this is what matters okay so may have and I want to remove the things that we took out of here so that utility now is gone and utility that mobile is gone some of this other stuff is gonna go as well but we'll wait till we get to that point alright let's save that and see what kind of errors we're gonna get all right constant blows out to full okay all right so we're gonna need to get rid of some stuff here in our main test master CS file so let's check that out now all right so where we at line 40 so in line 40 we can get rid of this top header because we totally remove that okay and let's see yeah I'm not worried about that a lot of these these sections are so that they you can control what's in the header through the CMS but I don't need their the parts of the header that need to be controlled will be controlled but that's mainly just gonna be the links and that's only gonna be in the side nav so it's better just to take it out and let's see if anything else everything else seems like it's dealing with a footer okay all right let's try that I'm really surprised that how how easy it is to catch on to what's what's happening so like I said I've pretty much never used csharp before or anything dotnet other than me kind of messing around with it a few months ago but it's well you know they say the programming concepts the concepts remain the same it's just syntax that's that's different alright so I still don't see the search bar but I would like to check out what's going on over here page outer wrapper actually not sure why we're still getting that yeah I don't think we should be getting that bad menu okay so here is our interesting okay so basically we are getting the correct output on the on the screen it's just seems like there's some styles that are either conflicting or just not working because we didn't pull in any of the wow it's just oh it's probably just something simple that I could find in dev tools okay this is the on mobile stuff okay yeah we don't obviously since we don't have the media queries that are supposed to govern this probably what's happening is so the the desktop menu must be hidden somewhere I just can't find I can't find where it's being hidden I guess it would just be there we go show on large now actually now that I think about it none of the classes will work so I'm not sure I'm not worried about it it's showing up here that's just a matter of bringing in the right styles but you can see we are actually getting what we want the main thing that I'm worried about here is checking to see that we we can get that search that search bar so we're let's see where it should be okay so if I search input okay if you look for search input great all right so we do have an input here and it looks like I mean it looks good this looks like it has what it should let's see if we can bring this out somehow to play blog fixed I would say find it no no it's still down there yes okay all right so for whatever reason I can't see anything so let's go over my timer turned off so I'm gonna do well I guess that's it so we're just going to do two Pomodoro sessions today and I have an appointment in a little while and it's gonna take me probably a half hour or so to drive there so I got to make sure whoops my my camera's off again sorry about that so anyway I gotta make sure I'm not late for that that's why I extreme dab it earlier than normal today okay I'm gonna scroll back up to where I was before and answer as many questions as I can I should be able to get to them all it doesn't look like there's too many if you if you can't stick around for the question answer session thank you so much for watching I'll probably be back tomorrow around 200 did it freeze again already never unfroze I forgot to put in my password I keep running I keep running this command it's a pseudo killall VDC assistant every time it freezes and that makes it unfreeze temporarily so anyway let me yeah let me get to the questions if you have a question go ahead and put it in a live chat now and I should be able to get to it here in a few minutes okay okay no beer says I can't install Visual Studio code editor I'm using Windows 8.1 I tried several times to install it but it comes up with an error help me please man I'm not sure I don't I don't have any machines that are running a Windows 8.1 so I've never had anything running it so I'm really kind of at a loss for how how to do things on there but hopefully there's somebody else here in the live chat that has some experience with it all right see okay Alberto says the bad thing about asp.net is that it uses a lot of post backs of page refreshes at least reforms yes I've noticed that every time I do have to do anything with dotnet the whole thing's in a form so I don't know if you notice this but I mean check this out or that so the whole thing is in a form right so let's look at that that's all of our content basically in this form it's just weird what why is it all in a form and then it messes it up so trying to do things within this form like forms within a form it I've always had trouble with this so yeah and the page refreshes are terrible so I much prefer you know sending form data with fetch or with Ajax you know xhr and not having a refresh anyway I'm sure maybe if I knew more about it I it wouldn't be such a big deal and that is probably some way to work with it Harshit says where is this site hosted okay it's it is hosted here on campus in the in a different building that I'm at but probably I don't know less than two hundred yards from me is the server that that hosts this website so it's actually hosted on servers here but hopefully that will change when we redo the site so when we rebuild it will probably rebuild it with react and I don't know what we use for content management maybe WordPress maybe if we can find something else I'd kind of prefer to have something you know nodejs based just to keep the whole stack JavaScript I'm like somewhat thinking about just making my own really lightweight CMS I think that would be cool but we'll see so anyway at that point it'll be hosted elsewhere so maybe I don't know maybe digitalocean AWS I'm really not decided yet as to where it'll be hosted but it'll be something like that okay I'm buried so I see now that you asked if I deleted the repeater yeah that's it and that was in fact the problem so sometimes I just I don't look over fast enough to the live chat but I you're pointing out what I'm what I'm missing even though I don't always get to it right away oh wow I'm there's embarrassing even gave me the line then the number is line 152 thank you so much again I'm sorry that I didn't see it Nicholas asked is the react to the react project to complete its almost complete I worked on just some some little stuff some positioning like UI positioning at UI elements and things the only the only major thing left to do is handle the kind of clean up the email templates a little bit so that an email gets sent to the user who submits a form and it also gets sent to our project manager and making sure that those emails look alright that's about it also you know possibly just some some testing in different devices and things like that but there's really not anything significant that I could do a stream about that I think would be really interesting so that's why I switched over to this so I'll be doing handling those last few things you know kind of earlier in the day and then I'll be doing this for the stream and I still need to get some feedback from people in my department about project two to see what they think see if there's any changes needed it's possible if something comes up that I think would be good to do the stream about then I might go back and you know we'll switch it up and go back to project two and then you know kind of go back and forth and then it'll be you know in the title of the videos it'll it'll say what project it is but basically you know at this point I consider it for the most part done you know I think it could be in in less than a day I think it could be in shape to where you'd be completely ready ready to go all right so Berto says so this ASP control takes a data source the results from a query for example as data set okay and generates the HTML markup for displaying it okay he says you could learn all of the attributes to set for it but usually people resort to using the designer and Visual Studio okay yet so I read there was a manual and Ektron manual that came with this content management system and I looked through it and a lot of the stuff was saying like use the designer in visual studio well I don't I don't have visual studio I've never used it before and I'm I'm just like looking at this like can I just edit the code so I don't know but to me I feel more comfortable just looking at the code instead of trying to learn a different you know editor kind of more like a visual editor hopefully I can do everything that I need to do without having to do that so it's my understanding that vision that Visual Studio for Mac is not the same as Visual Studio for Windows so it wouldn't be it wouldn't be a simple thing for me to get that I'd have to either run Windows like as a second operating system on my Mac or get a better Windows I ever really old Windows laptop for testing and I don't want to run anything on that because it's too slow but it's so far I've been able to do everything in the code that I wanted to do world boss says is dotnet better than JavaScript so far just from my experience I prefer JavaScript but I have very limited experience with dotnet so I guess just take that a consideration when when you hear my opinion on that that I'm probably not the best person to ask I did I haven't I haven't had a fun time whenever I've had to work with dotnet the few times that I've had to work with it I enjoy JavaScript a lot better probably because I know it a lot better Nicholas says okay project three day twos yep that's it so yeah the the p.3d to project three day two so I just decided to shorten it like that because otherwise it adds way too much length to the titles so hopefully it's not too confusing okay let's see so we have somebody new saying hi say nice to meet you but it's in some other characters so I don't really know how to say that so I'm gonna try to translate that alright so sorry if this is wrong if this is not really your name I use Google Translate to try to figure this out so is it Clark John Peel so hopefully that's your name once again really sorry for messing it up but so Park Joe until says hi nice to meet you says I'm so I think they say they're new here so but welcome thank you so much so much for joining us and for saying hi and the latch at okay John John Hanson was saying I should have should add height so when we were trying to find this so I'm not gonna go back and mess with it now but all I'm afterwards I'll try to get this to display so we can see what's going on there okay so Umberto is talking about me posting this stuff on a repo so that he can port it over to MVC so I'm I'm interested in that but I'm just wondering like is that I don't know enough about this to even though what's what's entailed in this but would that work within the system I mean would it be would it work within the Ektron system or would this be something entirely different that would replace it so I'm not sure but I will I'll try to get you the I'll try to make a repo that I can have public the only thing I'm worried about is there's a config file that has like usernames and passwords for the database so I want to make sure that there's no more config files with information like that you know hiding somewhere so I just need to figure it out for sure and then get everything together and then I'll make a Omega repo so I don't know how soon I'll be able to do that but I'll try to get it done you know maybe in the next week or two okay okay Raphael says to work with asp.net webforms you need Windows Plus Visual Studio okay so there probably is some stuff that I can't do or I won't be able to do then alright so hopefully for what I need to do I'll be alright but I don't know I guess that that's kind of good rationale for me maybe getting a new computer here at work so that would be kind of cool I mean I'm still gonna mainly develop on my Mac because I'm used to that I like it but it might not be a bad idea to have a good Windows machine as well we'll see if I ask they probably just tell me to have the new web developer and the IT department handle everything because they're getting the new the new web developer gets a new Windows PC and the Mac okay all right I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat so I'm gonna wrap this up I I wanted to say something now I'm forgetting oh oh I want to say this especially if anybody's watching actually our viewers have kind of dropped off at the end there which is kind of normal but I know there are some people that watch the show that are also in the react nanodegree program so here's a little bit of of information that was helpful to me you all maybe already know this maybe I just didn't read properly but I was really worried that my my second project the Redux project was due Friday so I've been working on it a lot lately trying to get it ready to turn in on Friday thinking that you know it's due I'm gonna like I'm I'm not gonna be able to finish the course if I don't do it well I stayed up last night until 4 o'clock in the morning working on it so from 10 from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. I'm working on it and then I'm going through the list of requirements and I'm thinking you know what there's there's still I'm not gonna finish this tonight there's too much left so I said I'm gonna look up if I can get an extension so I go read the course handbook and it turns out that the deadlines to submit the projects are actually just suggested deadlines to keep you on track the real deadline is the complete end of a nano degree program which I think for for my start time the end for me is at the beginning of November so really I have till the beginning of November to turn this thing in and I stayed up almost all night I only got three hours of sleep pretty much for no reason it was okay I mean it was really nice to get like six enter uninterrupted hours to just work on it and I feel way more comfortable with Redux now that I have and I did almost completely finish the project so the UI is just completely a mess it looks like something out of the 90s webpage I might actually leave it like that because I think it cool it's cool when it reminds me of the first websites I ever built but anyway I say that because I looked in the slack channel for the nanodegree and there were other people that had similar questions and weren't sure about it so I I gave them the link to the the place where I found that information so I'm just I'm thinking it's possible that there might be somebody watching this that that might might not know like I did so don't freak out you don't have to turn things in you know on the on the due date it's just suggested so but I do really want to get the project finished soon and move on because the next project is going to be react native and I've never done anything with react native but I'm really excited about it I just I don't know I think that's really cool it'll be awesome for me to have something on my phone an app that I made I don't know that just seems really exciting to me websites are cool too but like I've been doing websites for a long time so that's just it's lost some of the excitement like just the the wow factor of doing it the novelty has worn off but anyway so I'm sorry to go on about that I just wanted to try to be helpful okay Ally asked what is the react nanodegree okay so it's um okay alice has found it okay yeah it's says founded it's pretty expensive yes it's it's it was expensive it was sometimes they have deals and you can get it for cheaper but when I got it there wasn't any like deal or anything there was no discount so it was $500 which when I think about it now I'm like why did I spend $500 on that I wish I had $500 now but at the time I had recently completed a project and I just got a big check from a client so I was spending like I was rich and so it didn't bother me and but I think it's it's been really useful so far so I think it will end up being worth it I'll probably be a while before I do another nanodegree because it is a lot of work and money but this was been really useful so far I think I'm gonna do maybe a review like video after I'm all done with it and just kind of go over like what I thought and what I learned and maybe that'll help other people decide whether or not they actually want to pay you know the $500 to do it as well okay I just see Ali said would you say it was worth it yet so far like I said it would be nice to have have five hundred dollars right now but that I paid for that but so far it's been worth it and I'm I'm not even through the the core so I've learned a lot and I've been able to use what I've learned in my projects for work and it's helped me a lot for those projects so like I learned about react router in the nanodegree program and I immediately started using react router on my projects so that was that was very useful and I think I'll probably end up using Redux and one of my upcoming react projects so that'll be useful as well and I'm not really sure what kind of app I'll build but I'm sure I'll figure something out to try to use react native I don't want to lose what I'm learning so I really want to try to implement the stuff that I'm learning in real projects and just keep using it otherwise if I wait a couple months I'll probably forget a lot of what I've learned and and then it would be more of a waste and it wouldn't be the fault of the people who made an Anna would be my own fault yes races you can learn all those things from a book as well and faster yeah yeah you can there's definitely a difference the one difference that I've noticed from the nanodegree program that you don't get in a book is the code reviews so there's live help so I can just ask questions and have people look at my code just live and help me with parts of it and then when my project is you know at a complete point where I think it's finished I turn it in and then people review my code and offer suggestions like line by line suggestions for how I could improve it and that's where I think the benefit is because you're right the actual information I mean you can get that wherever you can just read the docs and I actually did I ended up reading through a lot of the redux documentation and then I really understood it a lot better I mean the course was nice too but you get I got a lot out of the docs as well so yeah and I guess actually I don't ever really use books so when I you can't get it from books but I just get it from websites like what why buy a book when you have more uptodate information online for free you know not to say like I'm sure there are really good books out there as well I just prefer reading it or watching a video but anyway also like the motivation of having deadlines is nice of having these projects and like clear goals is really nice you know if you're really selfmotivated you don't really you don't need that but I'm really busy between my fulltime job and my clients on the side and my four kids and my wife I need some like goals and some pressure to force myself to learn things you know on my own time and outside of work so that's good for me in terms of making sure that I do it because I I don't want to I don't want to not finish a class that I paid $500 for so there's definitely pressure to make it worthwhile but I wouldn't have if it was just me I would probably just put it off and you know so there's definitely benefits to doing it but it definitely depends on your learning style and your own motivation the one thing too about so Shave mentioned you can go faster the one thing too is I mean this react nanodegree it's not like a normal like a typical classroom setting so you do go at your own pace so in terms of speed you're totally in control of how fast you go through the lessons and how fast you build the projects but in a traditional classroom I do agree that it's it's definitely way slower than you could do if you're learning on your on your own for most people well Ali said books are also out of date as soon as they are published I would think that the course gets updated the course actually has been updated a lot since I started which is surprising so so that's cool I mean that's it's actually it's good and bad for me cuz I'm in like the very first class that started so the first day it came out I started so we're I'm going through and as people find bugs they get fixed but I'm already passed those lessons so sometimes I see where they'll say they fixed all this stuff and I'm like whoa I already I already figured it out you know there's some things that were just a little buggy at first and you just had to kind of work around it so but they they progressively keep getting better as more people go through the course so that's really cool okay oh sure a says what about like stackoverflow ready yeah i like to learn from stackoverflow I don't really go on reddit often and then you know there's other good online resources so there's a lot of great YouTube channels and then right obviously free code camp is great and there's um just looking at code reading the documentation for the things that I'm using is is really helpful looking at other people's code on github and there are some good like online books like the the you don't know Jas series is great and it's all available for free on github so I think there's there's a lot of there's a lot of great free resources out there but for me at least at this point in my life with everything I have going on this is probably the fastest way that I was going to learn more about react and redux and react native it worked for me in the past when I had let's say more time and less money that wouldn't have been the right choice for me but for right now I mean I'm not saying I have a lot of money but at the time I happened to be able to spare that money so and still be able to pay my bills so alright so let me okay I have another there's another question sure I asked hey are you interested in Android programming I've been into that lately but I've also been interested in react native I'm not interested in directly programming Android so I'm very interested in react native but I'm not I'm not interested in learning how to do you know for instance like to do Java or Kotlin for Android or Swift for iOS I think iOS is still Swift I'm not as interested in that I'd rather I only have so much time to learn just focus on JavaScript and try to get as good as I can with that then to know like a little bit about a lot of different languages that makes sense for me in my career right now I'm not opposed to switching I'm not against other languages it just so happens that I've already come so far with JavaScript that it I think it would just be better for me at this point just to keep going with it smilers asked that you have ite education not formal so I mean I took I took a programming class a C++ programming class in college but other than that I don't have any formal education and this has all been kind of selftaught through almost exclusively free online resources with the exception of this nano degree program and maybe like one course I bought from udemy that was I think it was on sale for like 10 bucks so other than that though it's it's been all free resources and just kind of learning as I picked up clients and learning what I need to do to complete their projects okay Oh James sorry I missed your question earlier I saw it then I forgot about it so James asks about tablets for coding so saying can i code with a tablet if so what would you suggest you guys see like for instance the surface pro 3 I don't have experience with that so I don't know that I could be that helpful for you I know there there are some tablets that come with a keyboard I would think ideally like you would want that right or I just can't imagine trying to to do a lot of programming on a tablet without a dedicated keyboard maybe even a mouse so if I were looking for a tablet that I could code on probably the biggest things for me would be like is it powerful enough obviously you're gonna probably want to use some sort of like cloud development that'll run in the browser so but you just I would just kind of want to make sure that it's powerful enough to run that and not be too slow and then that it's I could easily hook up a keyboard and mouse but other than that I don't have any like handson experience you know with using a tablet of to code okay I think I've gotten through all the questions now okay all right so I've been through other questions now and that's good because I'm gonna have to leave soon for my my den I have a dentist appointment today so I have to leave soon to go see my dentist and all right so awesome so this will end up being a longer video than I anticipated but we did some good work we got some we got a lot done it may not seem like that much to look at it actually looks worse than when we started but behind the scenes we worked through a lot of errors got a lot done I'm really excited about this I feel like I'm I'm finally starting to wrap my head around what's going on here and this is good I think we'll be able to do a lot to make this homepage you know a lot faster and just a much better UI and so I'm excited I'm really excited about this this would be cool at least for me a lot of people will notice this change this would be a big change so that'll be fun to see what would people around here at the university think about it so probably be back tomorrow around 200 p.m. Eastern time I'll let you know for sure what time on Twitter so you can follow me on Twitter if you like or if you subscribe to this channel you should get an alert at some point when I scheduled the livestream so you know either one of those two so you know one of those two avenues will we'll get you the time of the stream and yeah thank you so much for watching thank you for helping out in the live chat a lot a lot of good advice and good help and especially thanks to Umberto offered a lot of help and was very patient with me really not knowing what I was doing so I appreciate that that was awesome that you were very patient and kind about telling me when I when I was doing something wrong so again thank you and have a great day I'll see everyone tomorrow
