00:12 - hey everybody welcome to live-streaming
00:15 - with Jessie today we're going to get
00:17 - into some Redux which we set up
00:20 - yesterday so if you want to see how how
00:24 - you do the initial setup to incorporate
00:27 - Redux into your react project check out
00:30 - yesterday stream today we're gonna
00:34 - figure out how we want to structure our
00:36 - store so from what I understand you
00:41 - should think about how you're going to
00:43 - structure your store before you really
00:44 - start building out everything for your
00:47 - app so we're going to put some thought
00:50 - into that at first the last time I did a
00:54 - Redux project I didn't completely figure
00:59 - out what I wanted to do with the store
01:00 - and it ended up causing me to have to re
01:03 - redo a bunch of stuff
01:06 - probably like two or three times I
01:09 - changed my mind on on how I wanted to do
01:12 - that so I definitely caused more work in
01:15 - the long run so I don't want to repeat
01:17 - of that let's see I I think we'll do at
01:28 - least two Pomodoro sessions of coding
01:30 - today in between those we'll do a
01:32 - five-minute session of question and
01:34 - answer and then of course at the end
01:35 - they'll answer all the rest of the
01:36 - questions so if you're new to the stream
01:39 - that's kind of the order that that we go
01:43 - in and I know there's there's some stuff
01:46 - going on today so I know Google's has
01:48 - live stream stuff going on so not sure
01:54 - how many people will want to watch this
01:55 - stream when we have other stuff going on
01:59 - there's a conference to going on that I
02:01 - I see people on Instagram or posting a
02:04 - lot of stuff from the conference but
02:07 - it's like the women it's a women in tech
02:09 - conference I can't remember what the
02:12 - official name of it was but it looks
02:15 - like a pretty big conference so not sure
02:17 - if they're live-streaming but if so it's
02:21 - possible okay so the Google stream just
02:23 - ended
02:24 - all right cool so we won't
02:25 - competing with the google stream now for
02:30 - those of you who watch the google stream
02:32 - so this is going to be a somewhat
02:34 - unrelated question here but I watched a
02:38 - little bit of the stream you know the
02:41 - stuff look cool I didn't get to see
02:42 - everything for some reason the stream
02:44 - just kept freezing for me
02:45 - and so I missed a lot but I have a pixel
02:51 - XL and it looks like I might be able to
02:55 - get like $400 to trade in my pixel XL
02:58 - and if I get a pixel 2xl it would cost a
03:02 - little over $500 assuming that I got the
03:06 - 400 if I do the payment plan it might be
03:10 - like somewhere around 20 25 US dollars
03:14 - per month which is it's doable so what
03:22 - do you think is it worth it now to
03:24 - upgrade from the pixel XL to the pixel
03:27 - to excel or should I just wait till next
03:31 - year and keep this pixel for two years
03:34 - before I trade it in so I was going to
03:37 - just wait till next year but then I saw
03:40 - how much I could get for the trade-in
03:41 - and thought wow that's that's nice so
03:46 - anyway I'm a little bit undecided right
03:50 - now about it and it did sweeten the deal
03:52 - a little bit that you get a free Google
03:56 - home many I think that's what they're
03:58 - calling it
04:00 - if you do get the the pixel - so a
04:05 - little added bonus but anyway I'm
04:07 - undecided so so let me know ok so Cronus
04:14 - says wait till Black Friday Rowland says
04:17 - wait for next year William says just buy
04:20 - it outright interesting so you think if
04:22 - I buy it outright and then just try to
04:23 - sell my my pixel my current pixel phone
04:27 - I could get more money for it assuming
04:30 - that's what that's why I would just buy
04:33 - it outright I didn't think about that
04:36 - but I'll have to see how much they go
04:38 - for
04:41 - okay so let's get all right so Rowan
04:47 - thinks it's not really that big of an
04:49 - upgrade yet yeah I really didn't didn't
05:00 - think that there was that much that was
05:03 - better with the phone yeah I don't know
05:09 - I'll have to look into it more and see
05:11 - if it's if it's better all right so
05:14 - let's get started
05:17 - yesterday I forgot to go over some of
05:20 - the pool requests that we received so at
05:25 - the end after we do the coding but at
05:28 - the beginning that question and answer
05:29 - session I'm gonna try to remember to go
05:32 - over those let's see let's bring over
05:39 - let's bring over our Pomodoro
05:42 - and we have our yeah this is the right I
05:46 - have quite a few terminals open but this
05:52 - is yeah this is the right one okay great
06:01 - let's see
06:11 - not sure what I changed I got rid of
06:23 - okay so I never committed that sorry
06:29 - sorry that I didn't commit that stuff
06:35 - let's see what did we do all right let
06:41 - me start this first thing I'm gonna do
06:43 - is commit some of this stuff to github
06:46 - so you all can can check it out the link
06:48 - to the github repository is in the
06:50 - description for this video now so you'll
06:53 - be able to see everything that working
06:56 - on github also let's get Angra running
07:00 - and let's see I have it yeah so I have
07:07 - things going on on a terminal on another
07:14 - window let me see what's three thousand
07:19 - and one okay
07:34 - all right so I'm going to paste into the
07:37 - live chat the the link
07:48 - so that link should work I will
07:52 - double-check as well to make sure it's
07:53 - working okay great so it is working yeah
07:58 - it looks like I could see a lot of
08:00 - activity there so if you're not familiar
08:04 - with this this will allow you to see in
08:09 - real time what's going on when we make
08:10 - changes on your own computer and that
08:15 - way you know you can open up dev tools
08:17 - you can check things out this you won't
08:21 - have I'm I'm not a hundred percent sure
08:29 - about this but potentially let me try
08:32 - this out you might even be able to use
08:35 - the Redux Chrome extension and see if it
08:41 - works
08:43 - stay yeah okay so this actually works so
08:46 - whenever we're creating our store you'll
08:49 - be able to have access to this as well
08:52 - so assuming that you that you get this
08:55 - for Chrome and I don't remember what
09:01 - it's called what did we call it in our
09:06 - at redux dev tools extension all right
09:12 - so I tried redoubts dev tools extension
09:14 - and see if that's the name if it's not
09:17 - let me know I could look up what the
09:20 - name of it was officially so you can get
09:22 - that but that will be really helpful to
09:25 - understand what's going on with with
09:28 - redux okay
09:36 - so let me bring over I'm gonna run on
09:42 - local 3,000 won okay so right now we
09:52 - have the most basic of apps here but we
09:59 - have a couple of routes in here we don't
10:01 - have them length but if we typed it into
10:03 - our address bar we could go to the other
10:07 - routes let me commit and what did we do
10:15 - the we added routes that's about what we
10:20 - did okay so that code is now on github
10:29 - now let's this thing about what we want
10:34 - to do for our for a store so we'll need
10:44 - to think about two things so one what
10:47 - are we going to actually display to the
10:49 - user you know what are we gonna do with
10:51 - the data and then also what's the day
10:54 - that looking like as it's coming in so
10:57 - we're using WordPress as our content
11:01 - management system and we're getting data
11:02 - from the WordPress API so we can check
11:05 - out how that data looks and let me find
11:13 - let me bring up just some sample
11:17 - WordPress API data hmm I know I have a
11:24 - test
11:27 - I'm pretty sure have a test WordPress
11:29 - installation somewhere just for this so
11:31 - let me do a quick check
11:55 - oops I typed in the wrong address here
11:59 - we go
12:04 - I'm gonna pull it I'm doing this on my
12:06 - other screen but I'll pull it over just
12:08 - in a minute when I get the right thing
12:18 - okay awesome
12:23 - let me bring this over okay so here I
12:30 - actually just pulled this off of my own
12:33 - website which if you go there know that
12:36 - I have not updated this for quite a
12:38 - while so the actual design is five years
12:43 - old maybe at least five years old the
12:47 - content has been updated maybe maybe
12:51 - like two and a half years ago and
12:53 - nothing has happened since then so so be
12:57 - kind if you comment on it but I do have
13:02 - some some posts on there so this is what
13:06 - the date is going to look like we can
13:08 - change how this data comes in so if we
13:12 - don't need every bit of this data we can
13:14 - filter that out so this is just an
13:18 - example of the basic data you'd get from
13:21 - the WordPress API if you didn't have
13:24 - anything else running but just the API
13:27 - so no extra plugins no custom post types
13:30 - so we're gonna get an array of objects
13:34 - everything is going to have certainly
13:37 - unique ID the dates those will probably
13:39 - be important to us
13:42 - the only other fields that we really
13:45 - care about would be probably the status
13:51 - right we don't want to pull in drafts
13:54 - the slug we don't we're not worried
14:00 - about the link we want to know the type
14:01 - if we end up having custom post types we
14:04 - definitely want to know what type it is
14:07 - certainly the title and the content not
14:13 - really worried about the excerpt maybe
14:18 - we'll want that but I don't usually use
14:22 - it
14:26 - see we don't need the author we won't
14:30 - need something with the featured media
14:31 - but what I'll probably do is use a
14:33 - plug-in so that we can get some better
14:35 - data our categories and tags we will
14:42 - need information on these but again I'll
14:45 - probably use a plug-in so we get better
14:47 - data right now we just get the number 43
14:51 - all right so that means the category
14:54 - with the ID 43 which isn't that helpful
14:56 - I want to know what's the name of the
14:58 - category what's the slug so we'll be
15:01 - doing something different for that and
15:05 - that's about it so a lot of this stuff
15:08 - we won't even worry about but one thing
15:10 - I would like to do once we get this data
15:13 - in is when it's in the store I don't
15:16 - want it just like this what I want it is
15:19 - in the format of and the meeting I'll
15:22 - make this smaller do I really only have
15:24 - two posts I guess so
15:28 - so what I want is to pull the ID so the
15:34 - I assuming the ID numbers are all unique
15:36 - which I'm pretty sure that that is the
15:38 - case we can either use the ID or the
15:42 - slug but for now let's just say we're
15:44 - gonna use the ID so we'll have our array
15:47 - and then we're gonna have key value
15:53 - pairs where the ID becomes the key and
15:56 - then the value is this object okay so
16:02 - what that will allow us to do then is to
16:06 - we'll have our posts in the store and
16:11 - when when we want to pull in more posts
16:16 - and merge those new posts in it will
16:20 - check based on the ID and it will only
16:24 - update it would only add those posts
16:28 - that have a different ID or potentially
16:32 - update the posts that have the same ID
16:36 - and then we can keep the other stuff in
16:39 - the
16:40 - or we'll be able to reference those by
16:43 - ID if we need to so that's the that's
16:47 - basically the structure of the store
16:49 - what I what I wanted to be structured
16:53 - like we're probably going to run into
16:56 - some other things like maybe we'll want
16:58 - to add some data into here that isn't
17:00 - that we can't get from WordPress so if
17:07 - that happens you know we'll deal with
17:10 - that when we get to it but first step is
17:13 - just to bring this data in and then
17:15 - change it to the format that we want so
17:20 - for now I'm just going to use this data
17:23 - from my own website and eventually we'll
17:27 - probably want to bring in some data a
17:31 - you know that's closer to what we're
17:34 - actually going to use but this will work
17:37 - for now so let's get this set up to
17:47 - actually pull in some of the data we'll
17:51 - need to
18:02 - but you can make our API calls so let's
18:04 - pull in let's make another folder so
18:11 - another directory we're going to do this
18:14 - in our source and we're gonna call this
18:19 - leads and then we're gonna we're gonna
18:28 - make a file in there it's gonna be let's
18:32 - call this actually let me double check
18:38 - I want I'd like to use the same naming
18:41 - conventions that I've been using for my
18:44 - previous read up project Redux project
18:47 - just to make it consistent so I'm gonna
18:51 - bring this up on my other screen and
18:54 - github and if you want to check it out
18:56 - that's the Udacity react and the
19:00 - readable project on my github profile
19:05 - which I'll just post the link into the
19:08 - live chat so this will be an example of
19:14 - the entire redux app that's already
19:17 - finished and working so our app that
19:22 - we're building won't look exactly like
19:23 - this but it will share some elements
19:28 - okay so let's go with those
19:44 - okay so now that we have this all
19:50 - everything that we're going to need to
19:52 - get data from WordPress we're going to
19:54 - put in here so that'll keep it separate
19:59 - and it won't clutter up our other our
20:05 - other files so let's go with there's
20:17 - some words press I'm gonna exports let's
20:22 - call this stretch pose
20:30 - and we're gonna use fetch so if you're
20:37 - not familiar with the fetch API this is
20:41 - a way to make basically what you would
20:45 - use Ajax for or some people use Axios
20:52 - there's some other libraries I guess
20:53 - that can do the same thing but fetch is
20:59 - it's it's newer I mean it's been around
21:01 - for a while but it's newer and I I like
21:04 - using it I think it's very simple so
21:08 - check it out if you if you haven't used
21:11 - it yet you're definitely gonna see an
21:12 - example of using it here and we've used
21:15 - it for I think all of the projects that
21:19 - we've needed to make an API call for
21:21 - that we've worked on on this stream
21:24 - we've used fetch for that so let's let's
21:29 - get our URL and what I put that
21:48 - I cannot find where I put the data I
21:54 - losing my mind here I hope I didn't
21:59 - there we go
22:00 - here's alright so here is our data and
22:05 - so we're just gonna grab that is that's
22:08 - where we need to make the call - so
22:11 - we're gonna fetch that and we shouldn't
22:14 - need I don't think we need any headers
22:18 - with this we'll try it without it if we
22:22 - end up needing some I'll go back and
22:24 - check out some of the code from a
22:26 - previous project and just see how we did
22:28 - it from on that project we should be
22:31 - able to just go from here and then we're
22:41 - gonna have our data and let's go
22:51 - all right such a sum and that's it I
23:00 - think that's all we need for right now
23:02 - we may grab some some different things
23:05 - here so this is probably not all we're
23:10 - gonna do but this will work for now so
23:15 - let's save that and then let's connect
23:20 - this so we're going to connect this into
23:24 - our actions so let's find some actions
23:30 - as our reducers oh here I already had
23:35 - the actions up so here's our actions so
23:41 - what we'll do is we're gonna make C
23:47 - we're gonna have to import what we had
23:50 - just done here import
24:07 - - from
24:14 - eatos
24:19 - okay so now we've imported this and then
24:24 - right now we only have one export but
24:27 - when you put this here that is just
24:30 - going to bring in all the exports so
24:32 - correct me if I'm wrong on that but
24:35 - that's why we're just bringing it in I'm
24:37 - anticipating possibly having more here
24:39 - so I'm just going to do it like this
24:41 - right off the bat okay so now I'm gonna
24:49 - bring in let's make sure
25:15 - let's go with
25:21 - okay so we're bringing in the dispatch
25:24 - because we're in it after we make the
25:27 - API call we're gonna dispatch this
25:30 - action so it'll be kind of a two-step
25:33 - process so from our component we're
25:36 - gonna dispatch this action that's why
25:39 - we're exporting this then it's gonna
25:43 - make the API call get the data and then
25:45 - pass that data as posts into this action
25:50 - when it dispatches that action okay and
25:52 - then from here it's gonna go to the
25:54 - reducers so that's what we're gonna do
25:57 - so let's go what we call this post API
26:07 - until and then we're gonna go fetch
26:13 - posts right so from the post API util
26:17 - we're calling fetch post and then we
26:23 - don't need to pass anything right so
26:25 - everything it needs is right here and
26:28 - then let me go then then we want our
26:34 - posts here and let's just
26:51 - we're gonna dispatch get posts and we do
26:58 - need to pass it our posts it's so
27:03 - probably not formatted in the best way
27:07 - but we'll get our Auto formatting and I
27:10 - did not set up the plug-in and Adam to
27:13 - do the formatting for me yet but when we
27:16 - commit we'll get our formatting okay I
27:21 - think that's everything I need let's
27:24 - save it just see if we get any errors
27:29 - yep we did okay import and body of
27:34 - module reorder to the top okay so what
27:38 - did I do I need to import at the top
27:40 - okay
27:49 - all right if that's our only error then
27:52 - I'm fine with that okay great so now
27:56 - that we have that done we actually need
27:59 - to call this from from inside of a
28:02 - component so let's go to our home our
28:07 - home page and if you remember we took
28:11 - out part of this here so we're gonna
28:18 - need to put that back in so let me grab
28:22 - it so I have it in another repository
28:25 - I'm just going to copy and paste it from
28:27 - there
28:38 - okay so actually I'll type this out cuz
28:41 - it'll be easier for me to explain it I
28:44 - think if I if I type it it might be I
28:46 - don't know I think it'd be easier to
28:48 - comprehend if we go step by step instead
28:50 - of me pasting a bunch of stuff in there
28:52 - all at once so we're gonna go map
28:58 - dispatch to props and then we can let's
29:10 - use this here
29:16 - all right so now we'll have dispatch
29:18 - available in our props and then also I'm
29:21 - gonna say fetch data and we're going to
29:33 - let's see do we need to pass now we
29:35 - don't eat we're not gonna pass anything
29:36 - right now we're in a dispatch fetch post
29:50 - and that's where we're gonna make that
29:54 - that call now we need to import fetch
29:56 - posts so let's bring that in oh actually
30:03 - and I I did not I just commented that
30:08 - out alright so now we can bring in fetch
30:14 - posts from actions right so in our
30:17 - actions we're exporting fetch posts and
30:27 - on
30:45 - let's see mounts uh this Frost
30:53 - fetch fetch data okay so let's make sure
31:00 - fetch data if it's David dispatch fetch
31:04 - props fetch pose okay alright let's see
31:10 - if this works
31:11 - make sure I save these two and we'll
31:14 - give it a shot alright what do we have
31:15 - here this processed data is another
31:17 - function what did I get wrong
31:53 - oh okay I never brought in map dis
31:56 - bastard props here so I didn't need to
31:59 - bring this in as well
32:00 - map dispatched across there we go let's
32:08 - see alright great so now you don't have
32:11 - the error let's check our store there we
32:18 - go
32:19 - cool so you can see under receive posts
32:22 - we now have our data and this data can
32:32 - be available to any component and so all
32:35 - we have to do is since this is in the
32:37 - stores you know just pull in our data we
32:41 - can Mack state two props and and have
32:44 - that available so we can even see so
32:48 - within our component state yeah why is
32:56 - react not turning on hmm so for some
33:02 - reason area for some reason it wasn't
33:06 - working when I was clicking on the
33:08 - drop-down but let's go in here um if we
33:14 - check out or so we have our dispatch a
33:17 - fetch data where we got
33:26 - as a tier where some states
33:32 - I'm a machine
33:48 - actually this is odd I should be able to
33:50 - see the state around I should be able to
33:56 - see it in props what am I missing here
34:34 - okay maybe
34:40 - it's
34:47 - did I forget did I forget to start my
34:51 - timer or did it go off and I didn't hear
34:53 - it okay so I'm definitely gonna take I'm
34:58 - gonna take my short break now new
35:00 - question answer so sorry about that
35:01 - obviously it's been longer than 25
35:04 - minutes so alright so I'm gonna take a
35:07 - break from that for just a second and if
35:10 - it's not clear what I'm worried about is
35:13 - I I expected to see something different
35:19 - for props so maybe I'm just mistaken but
35:24 - we'll check that out in a few minutes so
35:28 - I'm going way up to the top of the live
35:29 - chat I'm just gonna work my way down
35:30 - look for questions or any comments that
35:34 - you know pertaining to this part of the
35:37 - project and then later on I'll go over
35:40 - all the rest of it when we're done with
35:42 - the coding portion
35:53 - Skaar no asks are you going to write
35:55 - tests I would like to write some tests
36:00 - I'm not great with writing tests so I'm
36:06 - gonna have to think about how I'd want
36:07 - to write those what I'm gonna use and
36:12 - then learn how to do it so so I'd like
36:15 - to but I haven't made any decisions
36:18 - regarding that yet Cronus says when we
36:27 - use C++ for this project for this
36:32 - project which is project for I'm not
36:35 - going to be using C++ I for project 3
36:41 - which will be going back to occasionally
36:43 - we are using c-sharp
36:47 - but I don't have any projects where I'm
36:49 - currently using C++
37:01 - let's see alright so Marco says hi Jesse
37:06 - first time here
37:08 - finally I catch you streaming greetings
37:10 - from Brazil hey how's it going I noticed
37:13 - you had a comment on the last video
37:15 - saying that you never get to catch the
37:17 - live stream so really glad that you
37:19 - could be involved in the live stream
37:22 - today so feel free to ask any questions
37:26 - or you know throw your opinion in in
37:29 - there in the live chat si all right so
37:38 - I'm not gonna read this person's name so
37:41 - they don't get in any legal trouble but
37:43 - someone keeps asking how to hack a
37:45 - facebook account without a phishing page
37:47 - I am NOT going to answer that question
37:50 - so normally I answer any questions but
37:54 - that that question seems like the type
37:58 - of question that will not lead to
37:59 - anything good so so sorry about that but
38:05 - we're not going to talk about hacking
38:07 - Facebook pages on this stream
38:17 - so if you do want to stick around to the
38:21 - person that's talking about hacking
38:22 - Facebook pages if you do want to stick
38:24 - around watch the stream ask some other
38:26 - questions not related to hacking that's
38:29 - awesome
38:30 - if if you keep asking the hacking
38:32 - question over and over again then I
38:37 - don't want to maybe I'll block I don't
38:41 - know it depends if there's a huge wall
38:42 - of questions then maybe it would be too
38:46 - much but it looks like as I'm scrolling
38:48 - down there's not a lot of questions
38:53 - we'll see okay nice or asked is your
38:59 - asp.net core project three for beginners
39:03 - I see a lot of complication in that
39:05 - project some of that project is
39:09 - definitely could be for beginners it's
39:12 - just you know kind of basic just
39:14 - building a layout HTML CSS the parts of
39:22 - the project where we're actually going
39:23 - through some of the c-sharp and trying
39:26 - to build out the templates could be a
39:27 - little bit more complicated it just
39:29 - depends on your background I guess but I
39:32 - have I have a different approach to that
39:35 - project that so the next time we do a
39:37 - stream for project three I'll introduce
39:40 - kind of my new approach that will allow
39:42 - it to be a little bit more interactive
39:43 - and allow me to accept full requests and
39:46 - things so so maybe that'll make it a
39:51 - little bit more beginner friendly
39:52 - hopefully it will all right
40:03 - so jonbi loves the minimal design so far
40:08 - home this is the home page yeah I just
40:11 - want to be user-friendly and as
40:13 - straightforward as possible so I didn't
40:14 - want there to be any confusion that
40:16 - that's the home page all right
40:31 - david says where are you from Jessie I
40:33 - guess South actually so right now I'm in
40:37 - Steubenville Ohio but I grew up in West
40:40 - Virginia but probably not the type of
40:43 - West Virginia that you think of when you
40:45 - think of stereotypical West Virginia so
40:47 - I grew up in the most northern part of
40:50 - West Virginia which is actually about 20
40:54 - minutes away from Pittsburgh it's right
40:56 - there on the same latitude of Pittsburgh
41:00 - so anyway so that's where I'm Betsy I'm
41:05 - from actually the city where I'm from
41:08 - according to Jeopardy at Alex Trebek is
41:11 - the only city in the United States that
41:13 - borders two different states so the part
41:17 - of the city that I lived in the end of
41:19 - my street was Pennsylvania and then the
41:22 - other side of the city borders the Ohio
41:24 - River and of course the state of Ohio so
41:27 - anyway I could at one point I could walk
41:31 - in my backyard and and go into
41:33 - Pennsylvania right through my backyard
41:36 - so I always thought that was kind of
41:37 - cool I used to stand on that spot and
41:39 - say like I'm in between states anyway
41:42 - but that's around froth
41:54 - let me see my huh my time I went off I
41:59 - for some reason it's not beeping it used
42:02 - to beep in my I could hear in my
42:04 - headphones so I'm just gonna have to
42:06 - make sure I keep checking this because
42:08 - I'm not getting that that beeping sound
42:10 - I'm gonna refresh just see if it helps
42:15 - okay let's see I'm gonna come back
42:23 - I did notice Williams says nice about
42:29 - page photo I don't remember what photo
42:31 - that is I'm gonna check it on my other
42:33 - screen and quickly cuz now I wonder what
42:40 - picture I have on there oh man that's
42:46 - what I had my hair longer I need to
42:50 - change that so I'm not gonna show that
42:56 - on the stream you're welcome to look it
42:57 - up if you want but uh huh
43:00 - I need I need to do something else with
43:04 - that site okay so back to coding to
43:15 - restart our timer and
43:24 - alright let me think
43:30 - what is
43:43 - Cephas
43:47 - okay that makes sense
43:57 - Steve
44:03 - see this was that my problem
44:18 - hmm
44:26 - there we go okay now we have it so now
44:30 - you can see in the props for home
44:33 - we have posts and that's because we
44:38 - brought in here this part of the state
44:41 - right receive post as posts okay so the
44:49 - problem there was just that I had the
44:51 - wrong the wrong word there okay great so
44:58 - we're bringing this data in now at this
45:01 - point we could display it you know on
45:03 - the page but I want to change the
45:07 - structure of it so there's really no
45:09 - point in doing anything to display it
45:11 - right now because that that wouldn't
45:13 - worry I just I just check the live chat
45:20 - and it looks like a few of you have have
45:23 - checked out that photo so
45:43 - let's see
45:48 - okay
45:49 - so let's in our reducers we're so
45:55 - reducers here we go all right so we're
46:00 - gonna handle restructuring things in our
46:05 - reducers so if if you're checking out
46:15 - the other github repo that I'm getting a
46:17 - lot of these examples from you can check
46:20 - out the reducers now and that's where
46:22 - I'm going to get some some of the basic
46:28 - meal code from to do this
46:44 - okay so right now you can see we have
46:49 - our posts and it's just it's just in an
46:51 - array right so we have 0 and 1 and then
46:55 - our objects as I said earlier instead of
46:58 - the 0 & 1 what I really want is to have
47:04 - the basically change this into an object
47:09 - with key value pairs okay so here's what
47:13 - I'm gonna do to make that happen
47:15 - so within our reducers I'm gonna make a
47:19 - little helper function now I'm not sure
47:23 - if this is the best place to put this if
47:25 - it might be better to make this a
47:28 - separate component but for now I'm gonna
47:31 - put it in here and we can you know later
47:34 - on think about whether or not we want to
47:36 - put it in a different component okay so
47:40 - I'm just gonna call this function make
47:45 - object because that's basically what
47:49 - it's gonna do it's gonna take it and
47:51 - it's its form as an array all right
47:53 - we're going to turn it into an object
47:54 - and we're gonna bring in our items so
48:00 - for now it's gonna be post but
48:01 - potentially we could do this with
48:02 - anything so just kind of generically
48:04 - we'll call it items and we're gonna make
48:11 - a new object and we're just gonna set
48:17 - that to be an empty object for now and
48:20 - then I'm just going to do a really
48:21 - simple for loop there might be a better
48:23 - way to do it that probably is but for
48:27 - loops easy to understand it's easy for
48:30 - me and probably easy for a lot of the
48:33 - people watching I know before I got
48:37 - better with some of the newer Java
48:39 - scripts a lot of the tutorials that I
48:44 - read that used the newer stuff were very
48:46 - confusing because of just the newer
48:48 - syntax the concepts I think would have
48:50 - been a lot easier to get if it weren't
48:52 - for the newer syntax so ideal usually
48:55 - the newer syntax for a lot of things
48:57 - but in this case hopefully it makes it a
49:01 - little bit more user friendly okay
49:04 - so basic loop we're going to grab our
49:08 - items we want items dot length I could
49:10 - remember items is coming in as an array
49:16 - yeah and we're just gonna go through the
49:19 - items okay so we did use let's so if
49:23 - you're not familiar with that we're
49:25 - using let in constant set of variables
49:27 - so instead of you know var right we're
49:31 - using constant this is a constant and
49:34 - then let now I'm not gonna go into
49:38 - everything about these but basically you
49:41 - make a constant and you try to mutate
49:45 - that constant later on you're going to
49:47 - get an error for the most part with let
49:52 - you can change what let is obviously but
49:57 - its scoped that it's block scoped right
50:01 - so I could use let here and then I could
50:05 - use let in another for loop right I
50:08 - could use or I'm sorry I could use let I
50:11 - equals whatever in a lot of different
50:14 - places since it's block scoped it would
50:16 - be fine I don't have to come up with
50:18 - different variables for iterators I mean
50:26 - that's not the main reason why you would
50:27 - use let but in this case I think it's
50:31 - just kind of an easy way to kind of show
50:35 - the block scoping alright so within this
50:37 - for loop we're gonna do I'm gonna make
50:42 - some more constants
50:47 - if you're not sure about Wendy use cost
50:49 - and when do you slet generally of from
50:54 - my experience and from what I've been
50:56 - told from others you should pretty much
50:57 - use cost by default and then you only
51:01 - use let if you really need to use let
51:06 - let's see okay so we have our items so
51:15 - we're gonna grab the ID equals
51:28 - I don't I D whoa it's not what I wanted
51:33 - I'd be alright so we're not finished yet
51:40 - but just so far to show so we're
51:42 - iterating over these so we're getting
51:44 - our items so for this particular you
51:48 - know for each particular run through
51:49 - this loop our item is just going to be
51:53 - that that item or the at that position
51:57 - in the array they were going to grab our
52:00 - ID I'll do want to double check in the
52:03 - data structure
52:04 - I think it's ID but let's double check
52:06 - so that doesn't cause problems yeah
52:09 - ID okay so we're gonna grab the ID which
52:12 - for our first one will be 772 then what
52:17 - we want to do is get our new object and
52:23 - we're gonna go item ID equals item right
52:31 - so here's what we're doing so I don't
52:34 - want to confuse anyone so we made this
52:36 - constant right and I just said that you
52:40 - can't mutate a constant but in this case
52:42 - if we're adding things to an object
52:44 - that's a constant right that's that will
52:46 - work but I couldn't say new object
52:48 - equals a string called
52:51 - called what it called string right and
52:53 - then down here say a new object equals
52:56 - five okay that did we get an error on
52:59 - that alright so then our new object
53:04 - needs to be returned so what this will
53:10 - do is take well I'll show you let me
53:14 - show you the data and then it'll be
53:15 - obvious what it does so let's save that
53:18 - and let's call this from inside our
53:22 - receive posts so instead of merging the
53:29 - state with just action dot posts which
53:34 - is just the data we're getting in from
53:35 - the API we're gonna change that data a
53:38 - little bit by merging it
53:43 - what we get returned from make objects
53:50 - so let's say that now now let's check
53:58 - out our store there we go so you see the
54:02 - difference now so now we have our object
54:07 - right this is no longer an array this is
54:10 - an object with key value pairs and our
54:13 - keys are the IDS and then the value is
54:21 - all the rest of the the data for that
54:24 - item okay and then so now that you've
54:31 - seen it you can tell right that's that's
54:35 - just what we've done right we broke it
54:37 - down that that array and instead we've
54:40 - made in an object with the ID right as
54:45 - the key and then everything else as the
54:49 - value okay now here's here's the thing
54:54 - this is going to be actually I guess
54:57 - some stuff coming alive chat so let's
54:59 - see a shorter version
55:11 - okay cool so kevin is typing out in the
55:17 - live chat a shorter version so let's go
55:19 - ahead and refactor this right now for
55:21 - the shorter version so hopefully you
55:26 - kind of understood what was going on
55:27 - here it may or may not be easier to
55:30 - understand it once we refactor so let's
55:32 - do that now okay so in our for loop
55:42 - we're going to use a for loop okay so
55:46 - it's going to be for item
55:55 - okay so our four of loop is we're just
56:00 - making whatever we can this could be
56:02 - whatever we want to call it okay but
56:03 - we're calling it item of and then we're
56:07 - pulling in our items array here so for
56:10 - item of items so within here item is
56:15 - gonna basically be that the same thing
56:16 - as it was before but that's a little bit
56:19 - of a shorter way to write that that for
56:21 - loop and I would say honestly if you
56:26 - were just starting out I think this
56:28 - makes more sense in terms of explaining
56:30 - what's happening then then the other way
56:33 - we did the for loop with the iterator
56:40 - all right and we're gonna shorten this
56:43 - up by saying new object item ID let's
56:47 - see
56:55 - so we can get rid of this right because
56:57 - now we've taken care of it up here and
57:01 - then we can also get rid of this because
57:04 - we've moved it down to here so a lot
57:10 - shorter so let's save that and then it
57:21 - works
57:21 - yeah all right cool
57:32 - cool okay thank you Kevin
57:36 - definitely definitely shorter and more
57:41 - concise is usually almost always better
57:46 - alright great so now that we have that
57:50 - let's um let me check how much time we
57:53 - have okay ten minutes okay not bad let's
57:58 - actually get some of this onto the page
58:00 - so as much as this design now is is
58:04 - amazing in minimal I think it might be
58:08 - more helpful to the users if we
58:10 - displayed a bit more information I don't
58:14 - know about you but I don't know how many
58:16 - times I would come back to this page you
58:19 - know I just probably could remember that
58:23 - this is the home page so we're gonna put
58:24 - some more info on there now let's go to
58:28 - our home page and we're going to make a
58:36 - more proper return so we're going to eat
58:44 - we're gonna use the old-school way of
58:46 - returning not this newfangled react 16
58:49 - way so oh wow did Sebastian typed up an
58:56 - even shorter way of doing this all right
59:03 - let me copy and paste this alright let's
59:11 - check out Sebastian's
59:12 - even shorter way and I will I'm gonna
59:16 - paste this in right above at first just
59:18 - so we can compare okay
59:24 - so here we go so we have cost make
59:28 - object and we're using an arrow function
59:30 - so we're passing in items and then we
59:34 - have our new object we're mapping over
59:40 - our items
59:45 - and then we're making our key value
59:50 - pairs and returning the new objects so
59:53 - let me see is that really is that really
59:56 - shorter let's uh let's break this down a
60:01 - bit just to compare if this would really
60:06 - be that much shorter so how would I
60:09 - normally do this new objects
60:27 - yeah I guess that's how I would break
60:31 - this up
60:45 - okay
60:51 - all right so once I space this out it
60:55 - actually ends up being the same amount
60:57 - of lines all right so let's see I'm
61:13 - gonna move on from this because I mean I
61:17 - like this this is cool but we're gonna
61:19 - run out of time and not be able to
61:20 - display any data so yeah so map would
61:30 - normally be able to auto return these so
61:33 - do we even need well I guess right we
61:44 - don't want to we don't want to just
61:50 - return this each time
62:00 - I mean as as the Kim the entire thing
62:12 - all right I'll let you all discuss it
62:15 - discuss this in more depth for now
62:19 - let's comment one of them out so that we
62:22 - can work on this all right five minutes
62:28 - six minutes almost okay so let's let's
62:35 - bring in
62:43 - okay so we're already getting we know
62:45 - we're already getting the data in here
62:47 - it's getting passed in as props post and
62:56 - let's
63:02 - hmm
63:05 - all right so first thing we're gonna do
63:07 - is let's make a div just to be a
63:10 - container and then within there we're
63:14 - going to map let's give this propos'd
63:20 - and so we're gonna check if if this
63:26 - props posts is is there then we're gonna
63:31 - do is go objects okay so I'm gonna this
63:42 - is gonna seem weird but we're gonna
63:44 - change this back into an array because I
63:50 - want to be able to use map and filter
63:53 - and sort on this so we're gonna change
63:57 - this back and then we're gonna filter
64:13 - actually do we need to filter right now
64:16 - now I mean at some point we will be
64:18 - filtering these but right now I don't
64:22 - think we need to worry about that so
64:23 - let's go Matt hose
64:35 - most and within here for now let's just
64:41 - do an h1 and we'll give it a key of post
64:46 - dot dot ID and then we're gonna put in
64:55 - the post dot title rendered okay so that
65:03 - rendered isn't anything special that's
65:05 - just the way the data is organized in
65:06 - WordPress
65:10 - let's try that out it should work
65:15 - No what'd I do wrong let's check it out
65:25 - hmm
65:44 - nothing I already yes
66:43 - oops posts that's the problem
66:50 - yeah that's it all right so you can see
66:51 - that the only problem was I
66:53 - I forgot the s on the end so first it
66:55 - was checking if this props post exists
66:58 - and that doesn't exist right so there we
67:03 - go okay cool so now we can see we're
67:10 - able to use map and we could also use
67:13 - filter and sort which i think is a lot
67:16 - easier to work with which is the whole
67:17 - reason for this for changing this so
67:20 - that we can work with it here now we
67:25 - have our titles and actually I wonder
67:44 - I wonder if I could just display
67:47 - I can't cattle I there's got to be some
67:53 - way to turn this into the string isn't
67:55 - it like stringify something I see sorry
68:03 - I didn't check out the live chat you all
68:05 - saw ahead of time what what the problem
68:11 - was let's see
68:36 - so I could do
68:44 - let's see if that'll give us something
68:49 - all right cool
68:51 - okay so this looks really ugly but just
68:55 - to show you we're just trying to show
68:58 - you what what comes out here and in
69:04 - terms of what's getting passed so I
69:09 - still have thought about it I always get
69:11 - nice formatting because I have this
69:13 - plugin with JSON so now this is pretty
69:16 - much unreadable but anyway let's get
69:19 - back to something we're readable okay
69:23 - I'm pretty sure I've used up my time for
69:26 - that Pomodoro session
69:40 - I've lost my where my head
69:51 - I'm getting something from
69:58 - what did I do okay
70:02 - I didn't go back far enough there we go
70:09 - all right and there yeah so my timer is
70:13 - up so I'm gonna go to the live chat and
70:22 - let's see I'm gonna scroll back up to
70:29 - where I left off and if if you can't
70:37 - stick around for the question answer
70:38 - session I totally understand but if you
70:43 - can if you have some time I'd love it if
70:46 - you could help answer some questions or
70:49 - ask some questions of your own but
70:53 - otherwise thanks for watching and I'll
70:55 - be back again tomorrow probably around 2
70:59 - p.m. Eastern Time
71:01 - so let's go or I'll be left alright so
71:07 - I'm just going to go down through the
71:08 - list and answer hopefully have time to
71:11 - answer all the questions I know
71:14 - yesterday I had to cut it off you know
71:17 - pretty quickly when I got to the bottom
71:19 - of the questions but today I haven't
71:20 - gotten any messages from my boss so I
71:22 - should be okay let's see
71:33 - it's about Paige all right there's some
71:37 - some more comments on my about page
71:39 - photo ok so John BS he Jumby says I
71:51 - haven't worked with redux myself before
71:53 - what is the slug supposed to be the slug
71:56 - isn't a Redux thing okay and it's like
71:58 - William already answered so it's a
72:00 - wordpress thing yeah so the in WordPress
72:10 - normally I well there's several
72:13 - different ways you can have the URLs
72:14 - display but the best I think the best
72:17 - way to do it is have the slug be part of
72:20 - the URL
72:21 - so whatever the slug is for that post
72:25 - ends up being what's after the slash and
72:28 - your URL and it's it's also unique
72:34 - identifier for for the posts and pages
72:37 - have their own slugs - I've had some
72:45 - requests to speak Hindi unfortunately I
72:47 - cannot speak Hindi so apologize for that
72:52 - although if someone would like to
72:54 - translate these streams into Hindi and
72:58 - have them available as captions that
73:01 - would be awesome
73:02 - that would probably be a lot of work but
73:05 - it would be a good way to contribute to
73:07 - free code camp so if you're interested
73:12 - that's that's definitely an area where
73:14 - where we need more volunteers
73:16 - not just for Hindi but for any any
73:19 - language
73:32 - all right
73:37 - okay John Hanson asks if fetch is
73:39 - supported on all current browsers I
73:44 - think actually I haven't even checked I
73:50 - always use a polyfill so I can't answer
73:54 - that that question because it doesn't
73:57 - really matter to me because I use the
73:59 - polyfill so that's what my
74:06 - recommendation anyway if you're going to
74:07 - use fetch use a polyfill with it and and
74:10 - then you have to worry about it but I do
74:14 - think browsers are I'm pretty sure
74:21 - chrome can handle fetch but I guess it's
74:26 - worth checking it might be good to know
74:40 - and here we go if you're not familiar
74:44 - with can I use calm definitely a good
74:48 - site to memorize that URL it's really
74:52 - easy can I use calm and then you just
74:55 - type in whatever thing you're trying to
74:57 - use whether it be in JavaScript or CSS
74:59 - and you'll immediately get this chart so
75:04 - we can see if you want to use fetch
75:08 - obviously ie11 doesn't support it
75:10 - because it doesn't support anything edge
75:13 - Firefox Chrome Safari Opera iOS Safari
75:19 - even while Android Chrome for Android so
75:22 - basically it will work except for Opera
75:25 - Mini and Internet Explorer 11 and it has
75:29 - been supported even in previous versions
75:31 - of Safari and Chrome and Firefox so
75:35 - awesome so evidently chrome is or fetch
75:39 - is pretty usable right now it certainly
75:42 - depends on what you need to support them
75:50 - let's see
76:04 - William a little while back said we'd
76:07 - love to continue watching but it's
76:08 - meeting time so probably not watching
76:11 - right now but good luck with the meeting
76:14 - and thanks for watching and contributing
76:17 - in the live chat Kevin I'm so sorry so I
76:22 - just read a few comments after the
76:25 - original question about fetch Kevin said
76:27 - for compatibility questions Google can I
76:30 - use and then the feature name so anyway
76:35 - so sorry Kevin that I just tried to tell
76:40 - everybody about this when you already
76:41 - had so Kevin was on top of things that
76:47 - Marco says Axios or fetch which is best
76:50 - for big JSON files I I'd never used
76:57 - Axios so I don't know but Roland says go
77:01 - with Axios if you want backwards
77:03 - compatibility otherwise fetch is good
77:06 - jonbi says you might want to chain
77:08 - another dot then method to catch any
77:10 - errors in the event that the fetch
77:12 - request fails to retrieve the data okay
77:15 - yeah that's that's a good idea
77:16 - Jumby so what wolf to add that and I'm
77:19 - not gonna go back right now but yeah
77:21 - definitely normally you wouldn't want to
77:24 - like if for something that's in
77:26 - production you do want to catch errors
77:28 - so he's talking about here when we did
77:33 - our fats we would want to add in another
77:34 - then and then catch errors like that and
77:39 - possibly you know do something with the
77:42 - error right when you display a message
77:43 - or whatever however you want to handle
77:47 - that
77:55 - there's actually there's I've seen some
78:01 - interesting ways to handle errors when
78:04 - fetching data with with Redux so maybe
78:09 - for the next stream I'm gonna look up
78:12 - some of that and we can implement
78:13 - something something like that Marco says
78:26 - I'm developing my portfolio right now I
78:28 - was using pre-act and that's frustrating
78:30 - so I decided to use react instead react
78:34 - is a good choice for something like
78:36 - Israel is react a good choice or
78:38 - something like a small portfolio Relan
78:44 - says that react is probably overkill for
78:48 - small websites it doesn't mean you can't
78:51 - do it if you're comfortable react go for
78:52 - it so yeah yeah it depends on what
79:04 - you're doing in your portfolio site hmm
79:08 - so I I look tired yeah it depends on I
79:13 - guess on what you're doing I mean a
79:15 - portfolio site could be really simple
79:17 - one page thing or it I mean some
79:20 - people's portfolios are amazing you know
79:22 - they're like a work of art and they
79:24 - you're displaying their skills right so
79:27 - I wouldn't say right off the bat Reax
79:29 - overkill for a portfolio because it
79:31 - entirely depends on what you're trying
79:33 - to do with your portfolio if you want to
79:37 - market yourself as a react developer why
79:40 - not do your portfolio and react then
79:42 - your portfolio itself is going to be
79:43 - evidence of your skills at reacts even
79:46 - if it's overkill right so or if you want
79:53 - to learn react if you're trying to get
79:54 - better with react then yeah make your
79:56 - portfolio with react it will it be
79:58 - overkill probably but it'll get you
80:00 - practice with something that's kind of
80:03 - simple just to get you used to using
80:05 - your
80:05 - so if the question is simply is it
80:08 - overkill the answer is probably yes but
80:10 - if the question is should I use it then
80:16 - yeah I mean I would say there's nothing
80:19 - wrong with with using it if you want to
80:21 - if that's what you want to do if that's
80:23 - what you want to learn
80:34 - let's see okay so Kevin says is an
80:38 - alternative next j/s is an easy way to
80:40 - set up a site with react yeah definitely
80:44 - I definitely recommend that so one good
80:49 - thing about next is you don't have to
80:53 - worry about routing so if you're just
80:55 - doing a very simple site you didn't need
80:58 - any custom stuff going on and in the
81:01 - backend then you just have as a code
81:06 - your views folder I think maybe it's the
81:10 - pages folder so anyway there's a folder
81:12 - that you use a next and any components
81:14 - you put in that folder automatically
81:16 - it'll route to those so it takes care of
81:21 - routing for you
81:22 - it takes care of server-side rendering
81:25 - for you so it handles a lot of things
81:27 - you know like right now we're using
81:31 - react router and we're handing in our
81:34 - routing now it's not hard but that's
81:36 - just one extra thing that you have to
81:38 - learn so if you're just starting out and
81:40 - it's something simple next is probably
81:43 - the way to go because it handles so many
81:46 - things for you it's much easier to learn
81:50 - I think with next create react app is
81:55 - also pretty easy to learn but it doesn't
81:59 - do quite as much for you as next does
82:09 - okay Blake says in response to the same
82:15 - question here just go with plain
82:17 - bootstrap in HTML you're just building a
82:19 - portfolio by doing so you'll save a lot
82:21 - of time for another bigger project with
82:22 - react okay that's that's another
82:25 - viewpoint I hadn't even thought of yes
82:29 - so if if you just want to move on to
82:31 - make something really cool with react
82:33 - then maybe you just throw together that
82:35 - portfolio with the basic tools write
82:38 - HTML bootstrap or something like
82:42 - bootstrap yeah and then do something
82:45 - else with react so I get kind of does
82:50 - depend on how much time you want to put
82:51 - into this as well Rowen says I support
82:59 - going with vanilla JavaScript and add
83:02 - libraries to the project if you need
83:04 - them view if you really want to play
83:06 - with a framework okay also when we use
83:10 - the term vanilla JavaScript I know most
83:12 - of you probably know what that means but
83:13 - I saw I don't remember if it's a comment
83:16 - on a video or something but I saw
83:17 - somewhere where someone didn't know what
83:19 - vanilla JavaScript meant so just in case
83:21 - I want to explain that so vanilla
83:24 - JavaScript just means regular plain
83:26 - JavaScript with no other frameworks or
83:29 - libraries added in so it's as then like
83:33 - vanilla is usually seen as like the
83:36 - plain I mean even though technically
83:37 - Benelli is a flavor right it's plain so
83:40 - like vanilla ice cream is plain alright
83:43 - it's it's not chocolate or you know like
83:47 - rocky road ice cream yourself you know
83:48 - it's just the plain so that's what I
83:50 - mean by vanilla JavaScript let's see
83:56 - Leon says how how do you get posts in
83:58 - your component you didn't pass it to the
84:01 - store through the reducer or did I miss
84:03 - something okay let me let me see so
84:14 - let me just walk through some of these
84:17 - steps just an answer to this question
84:21 - just to show what what happened so so
84:27 - let's start out with at home so in our
84:31 - component here in our home component
84:33 - when the component mounts were fetching
84:36 - the data all right so we're dispatching
84:38 - this action to fetch posts let's go to
84:43 - our actions now so oops it's our reduces
84:49 - our actions are over here so fetch posts
84:55 - makes the API call here this API call
85:00 - returns our data all right and then all
85:05 - right we're returning you know data to
85:08 - JSON ultimately so that gets out here so
85:14 - that's what goes in here to this then as
85:15 - posts so this that is getting passed on
85:19 - its dispatching get posts so now that
85:23 - data the post data goes here from here
85:29 - this is where I serve reducers okay our
85:35 - reducers take over and then in so we're
85:40 - bringing in get posts from actions
85:53 - so when get posts is past then it's also
85:58 - passing in all that post data right from
86:01 - here and we're passing that through of
86:09 - course our make object function and
86:11 - returning our new object with our key
86:14 - value pairs that gets merged with
86:17 - whatever was in the state so this is
86:21 - what ends up going into the store and
86:23 - now we go back to the home component and
86:26 - now whatever was in the store as receive
86:30 - posts now becomes posts in our props for
86:35 - this component so that's basically the
86:40 - flow is there other stuff going on
86:42 - behind the scenes yeah definitely but we
86:44 - don't have to worry about that because
86:45 - Redux takes care of that for us
86:47 - so hopefully that was somewhat
86:52 - intelligible I don't know that I'm the
86:55 - best person to explain that but
87:00 - hopefully that helped let's see uh gto
87:09 - says will man stop being rude to people
87:11 - let them be was I being rude I don't see
87:16 - anybody in the comments that was being
87:17 - rude so maybe I was being rude let me
87:19 - know if I was I'm sorry uh let's see
87:30 - yes een says how much javascript should
87:34 - I know to learn any JavaScript framework
87:37 - Oh
87:39 - I honestly if we want to take framework
87:46 - loosely and just include like any
87:49 - framework like thing or library which I
87:53 - don't want to get into beta for
87:54 - framework versus library now but let's
87:55 - just say you could use jQuery without
88:00 - knowing very much at all about
88:01 - JavaScript it's really easy if you
88:06 - wanted to get something into something a
88:08 - little bit more advanced like react or
88:10 - angular I would say you'd have to have
88:13 - more knowledge about JavaScript but I
88:17 - don't think that you should wait to
88:19 - become a JavaScript expert before you
88:22 - move into a framework because they can
88:26 - handle so many things for you that
88:30 - there's really not there's value I guess
88:34 - in knowing how to do it but it's it's
88:36 - almost like a waste of effort to try to
88:39 - redo things in vanilla JavaScript that
88:42 - are already being done really well and
88:44 - have been tested thoroughly by you know
88:48 - in frameworks so I think at some point
88:51 - you learn the basics of JavaScript and
88:53 - then move into a framework and then
88:55 - continue to build up your knowledge of
88:58 - JavaScript as you do you do things right
89:00 - so I I was looking back at our project
89:03 - one and some of the code for that
89:06 - earlier I was making some updates to it
89:08 - and just looking at that already and
89:13 - that's only been you know a few months
89:16 - ago already my knowledge of JavaScript
89:18 - has increased so much but I've been
89:21 - building everything in react so yes I've
89:25 - been using reacts but my JavaScript has
89:29 - gotten better as a result so you know
89:32 - you can do both you can build up your
89:35 - skills in JavaScript while you're using
89:38 - framework
89:39 - a library so I'd say like if you get to
89:44 - the point where you understand enough
89:45 - JavaScript to be able to understand how
89:46 - to use the framework then go for it just
89:50 - remember that frameworks come and go so
89:53 - don't stop improving your JavaScript
89:55 - because that's what will get you through
89:56 - you know the shifting of frameworks and
90:00 - you'll be able to keep up with things
90:02 - better i josh says Ohi all right
90:11 - maybe josh is from ohio as well yeah so
90:18 - although I live in Ohio now I am still a
90:21 - mountaineer at heart so from west west
90:24 - virginians the the one like big college
90:33 - football team in the state of West
90:34 - Virginia's mascot is a mountaineer so
90:36 - that's why I say I'm a mountaineer at
90:39 - hearts okay
90:52 - Rohan says that is a nice photo the the
90:55 - photo of my on my website Blake says
91:00 - lovely photo Sebastian says yep great
91:02 - photo Kevin likes it too thanks
91:07 - everybody thanks I don't know I think I
91:10 - look kind of silly with my hair long but
91:12 - oh well
91:17 - jonbi said I think your phone is ringing
91:19 - my phone was ringing but I think it was
91:20 - a spam caller so if anyone ever tries to
91:23 - call me leave a message because I never
91:25 - answered my phone unless I know who it
91:27 - is because I just get so many spam
91:31 - callers so like it's just it's a waste
91:33 - of time to keep answering their phone
91:46 - that's John be said for the home page to
91:49 - make it a giant heart image because home
91:51 - is where the heart is that's a good idea
91:55 - maybe we'll throw that in okay he had
92:03 - some discussion over the best way to do
92:04 - that make object function that we had in
92:09 - our in our reducers so I'm gonna skip
92:13 - over that although that was a good
92:15 - discussion but let's see I think it
92:20 - would be hard to understand if I just
92:22 - try to read out all the code that's
92:23 - being posted for that
92:41 - see
92:47 - so what a lot of discussions still about
92:52 - that so I'm scrolling down I'm looking
92:53 - for another question
93:05 - okay so Matt set for the API call you
93:08 - can use async/await instead of then okay
93:15 - cool
93:15 - so yeah Matt if you're still watching
93:20 - look into a sink away okay so I see your
93:23 - further comments on that all right I'll
93:25 - have to look into that
93:26 - so in general is is async await a better
93:30 - way to do this then then then so if
93:33 - anybody has any opinion on that let me
93:35 - know I'll definitely check that out I'd
93:38 - like to do it the most efficient way I
93:41 - can
93:48 - Marko's asks if i'm using material UI or
93:52 - something like that i will be using the
93:55 - tear UI for this project so I haven't
93:58 - decided yet whether I'm going to use the
93:59 - newer version of material UI or the
94:01 - older version we'll see if you remember
94:05 - for our last project at the beginning
94:07 - they just came out with material UI and
94:10 - we tried to use it on like the first day
94:11 - it came out or at least the first week
94:13 - and had some trouble with it and
94:16 - switched back to the old version so I
94:19 - don't know well that's yet to be decided
94:21 - but we're definitely going to use
94:22 - material UI in some form
94:37 - let's see
94:49 - okay so jumpy says if I use
94:51 - json.stringify
94:52 - and then I would have done post common
94:54 - okoma - it would indent the JSON values
94:57 - by two spaces and it would be more
94:59 - readable cool I didn't know that awesome
95:03 - I mean I don't usually have to use json
95:05 - stringify to display stuff but that's
95:09 - that's really good to know for what I do
95:15 - so deep says how do i code the minimax
95:19 - algorithm for tic-tac-toe I mean I
95:22 - understand the concept of having trouble
95:24 - coding any tips
95:26 - I haven't actually worked on that one
95:28 - myself so I can't help you out i watch
95:33 - the video on it if you're not familiar
95:35 - with that so Bo did a video on making a
95:37 - tic-tac-toe game in JavaScript so it
95:41 - sits here on the free code camp so I I
95:46 - haven't tried to get myself so I don't
95:48 - know that I can answer that maybe if
95:49 - anyone else in the live chat now has has
95:52 - worked on that you know maybe maybe you
95:56 - could add something here in the chat
96:01 - should come with us is this playlist a
96:04 - little more advanced than playlist - let
96:08 - me think what was play this - what
96:10 - projects was that the Resource Center
96:15 - yeah hmm
96:21 - yeah this is going to be a little more
96:23 - advanced only because we're using redux
96:26 - so it's going to see more advanced but I
96:29 - think it's gonna help it's going to help
96:31 - us a lot more with with handling our
96:34 - data so if you remember in project one
96:39 - we were making similar API calls to
96:41 - WordPress so it's going to be a nice
96:45 - comparison to see basically to make a
96:48 - similar app using in the first case in
96:53 - project one not not using Redux we use
96:59 - next to bootstrap the project and then
97:05 - instead in this project we're still
97:07 - going to be making the same API calls
97:08 - doing a lot of the same things with the
97:10 - data but we're going to use Redux and
97:12 - then we've also used create react app or
97:14 - use react router so it's going to be
97:17 - doing this
97:18 - it's very similar things both using
97:22 - react but in two different ways of using
97:26 - react so I think it'll be cool it'll be
97:30 - a nice comparison
97:45 - piloff says just want to say thank you
97:47 - so much if you drop by India and New
97:49 - Delhi let me know I will be more than
97:51 - happy to treat you for all the effort oh
97:53 - that's awesome thank you so much
97:56 - cool so I don't have any plans to go to
97:59 - India right now but you never know maybe
98:02 - I'll see if there's any conferences
98:04 - JavaScript conferences in India and
98:06 - maybe all apply to speak there I've
98:10 - actually never been outside of my own
98:12 - country so that would be it would be
98:14 - cool India would most definitely be the
98:17 - farthest away I've ever been see oh also
98:23 - I did want to mention it I think I
98:25 - mentioned this last week at some point
98:27 - but I will be in Nashville Tennessee
98:31 - here in the United States at the end of
98:35 - November I think it's November 27th and
98:37 - 28th so if any of you are in that area
98:42 - let me know if you if you'd like to meet
98:46 - up you know somewhere and that that
98:49 - would be cool I'm gonna go to the
98:51 - November conference that's going to be
98:53 - in in Nashville so if you can make it to
98:57 - the conference that would be cool as
98:58 - well but I'll only be there for maybe
99:00 - like two or three days so we won't have
99:02 - a lot of time but it but it would be
99:05 - cool if anybody's interested let me know
99:13 - birdperson says hello hi campers how you
99:16 - doing Jesse not bad not bad so it was
99:23 - somewhat productive today so that's
99:25 - always good
99:33 - nice are says what CSS framework are you
99:36 - going to use let's try Bulma I was
99:38 - actually going to use material UI so I
99:40 - know I just said that and I know you'd
99:43 - asked the question before I mentioned
99:45 - that so I've never used one before I've
99:48 - heard it's been recommended before in
99:50 - the live chat so actually I don't know
99:54 - let me know is is boom ah does it play
99:59 - nice with reacts I'm gonna look this up
100:05 - right now
100:17 - okay all right so it looks like it's
100:20 - it's like bootstrap interesting okay so
100:29 - yeah actually Bouma looks really cool
100:31 - but I for this project I'm gonna go with
100:34 - materiai especially because we're gonna
100:36 - want to keep the same user interface as
100:41 - basically what we're gonna replace so we
100:45 - already have a bulletin site that is in
100:51 - use right now and it's going to be
100:53 - replaced with what we build right now
100:54 - but I'd like to keep a similar UI and
100:56 - it's already using material design style
100:58 - so it'd be much easier to recreate that
101:01 - if we go with material UI but I'll keep
101:04 - bulla in mind for a future project
101:07 - especially maybe for a side project for
101:09 - projects for the university that I work
101:13 - for which these are the projects that I
101:16 - always stream I'd like to keep things a
101:18 - little bit more consistent to make it
101:20 - easier for not just for me but for other
101:23 - people who might have to come in and
101:25 - work on these projects like if we hired
101:27 - new people on or if some happens to me
101:28 - and they replace me I think would be
101:32 - easier to have more consistency with
101:34 - things but I'm open to trying out new
101:38 - things when I can see
102:19 - all right so so back sebastien basically
102:22 - just explained what I just said so he
102:24 - said all the websites for the university
102:27 - that he works for fall is material
102:28 - design guidelines see how that's Therese
102:30 - but if any then Sebastian added at least
102:33 - the new ones the old websites are a mess
102:38 - I'm not gonna argue with the old
102:41 - websites are there was no consistency at
102:45 - all in the design and I don't know I'm
102:50 - not gonna say anything else but that's
102:53 - the nicest way I could say it is that
102:55 - there there wasn't consistency let's see
103:08 - okay david says for catching errors in
103:11 - the fetch it would be better to use dot
103:13 - catch instead of dot then okay cool I
103:19 - have to check that out
103:47 - okay so Kevin says that it using
103:50 - async/await is generally better to use
103:53 - with fetch so okay okay so Marco says
104:03 - there is a project that reacted boom ah
104:06 - you I so okay so we could try that for a
104:09 - react project so like I said for this
104:11 - one we need to go with material design
104:12 - but you know potentially for other
104:16 - projects we could switch it up and try
104:18 - that out so thanks for letting me know
104:20 - about that Marco and also Nasir I think
104:25 - it was yet nice our mentioned that as
104:29 - well earlier in the stream okay cool so
104:37 - Kevin has put some code in there for the
104:39 - to use async async await with our fetch
104:46 - so thanks for that Kevin let's try that
104:49 - after the stream depending on what time
104:51 - it is yeah I might I'll probably have
104:53 - time see alright and Matt says don't
105:02 - forget the catch okay cool I've gotten
105:05 - to the bottom of the live chat so gonna
105:10 - end things now if anybody has any other
105:14 - questions outside of the live chat in
105:17 - the livestream time we have a slack
105:22 - Channel and I don't remember
105:25 - I think the slack Channel we have we
105:28 - have a link to that in the description
105:28 - otherwise let me know send me a message
105:31 - or something and I can send you the link
105:32 - so we have a slack channel you can send
105:35 - me messages on Twitter or any other
105:37 - social media platform and of course you
105:39 - can put comments to the videos you can
105:43 - you can certainly put issues and all the
105:45 - github repo submit pull requests if you
105:47 - would like and use any of the repos you
105:49 - want take take any of the code and use
105:51 - it on your own projects so
105:57 - does this lack Oh Marcus says the slack
106:00 - doesn't work the link for slack doesn't
106:02 - work okay I'll have to look into that
106:04 - thanks for letting me know
106:05 - I'll check into the slack to see what
106:08 - what the problem is
106:11 - okay cool I'll have to get a better
106:13 - lengthen so yeah I didn't know so I'll
106:19 - work on that
106:20 - I'll do that right now before I forget
106:22 - so as soon as I end the stream I'll
106:23 - check out what's going on with that link
106:25 - and try to get an actual working link in
106:27 - there for the slack channel all right so
106:32 - thanks everybody for watching and have a
106:35 - lot of activity in the live chat which
106:37 - is awesome it's always it's always great
106:40 - when everybody's helping each other out
106:41 - and let's see I will be back tomorrow
106:52 - I'm just checking my calendar quickly
106:55 - cuz I don't I don't think I've checked
106:56 - my calendar at all yet today and yeah I
106:58 - think I'm free tomorrow afternoon
107:01 - so probably 2 p.m. eastern time tomorrow
107:03 - we'll be back I'm thinking we'll
107:06 - probably work on this project again
107:08 - unless something else comes up that I
107:10 - really need to work on or I think will
107:11 - be interesting we'll be right back on
107:13 - this doing some more stuff with with
107:17 - redux and maybe we'll bring in some UI
107:21 - components from a tier or UI as well all
107:25 - right so I'll see you all tomorrow until
107:28 - then have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to livestreaming with Jessie today we're going to get into some Redux which we set up yesterday so if you want to see how how you do the initial setup to incorporate Redux into your react project check out yesterday stream today we're gonna figure out how we want to structure our store so from what I understand you should think about how you're going to structure your store before you really start building out everything for your app so we're going to put some thought into that at first the last time I did a Redux project I didn't completely figure out what I wanted to do with the store and it ended up causing me to have to re redo a bunch of stuff probably like two or three times I changed my mind on on how I wanted to do that so I definitely caused more work in the long run so I don't want to repeat of that let's see I I think we'll do at least two Pomodoro sessions of coding today in between those we'll do a fiveminute session of question and answer and then of course at the end they'll answer all the rest of the questions so if you're new to the stream that's kind of the order that that we go in and I know there's there's some stuff going on today so I know Google's has live stream stuff going on so not sure how many people will want to watch this stream when we have other stuff going on there's a conference to going on that I I see people on Instagram or posting a lot of stuff from the conference but it's like the women it's a women in tech conference I can't remember what the official name of it was but it looks like a pretty big conference so not sure if they're livestreaming but if so it's possible okay so the Google stream just ended all right cool so we won't competing with the google stream now for those of you who watch the google stream so this is going to be a somewhat unrelated question here but I watched a little bit of the stream you know the stuff look cool I didn't get to see everything for some reason the stream just kept freezing for me and so I missed a lot but I have a pixel XL and it looks like I might be able to get like $400 to trade in my pixel XL and if I get a pixel 2xl it would cost a little over $500 assuming that I got the 400 if I do the payment plan it might be like somewhere around 20 25 US dollars per month which is it's doable so what do you think is it worth it now to upgrade from the pixel XL to the pixel to excel or should I just wait till next year and keep this pixel for two years before I trade it in so I was going to just wait till next year but then I saw how much I could get for the tradein and thought wow that's that's nice so anyway I'm a little bit undecided right now about it and it did sweeten the deal a little bit that you get a free Google home many I think that's what they're calling it if you do get the the pixel so a little added bonus but anyway I'm undecided so so let me know ok so Cronus says wait till Black Friday Rowland says wait for next year William says just buy it outright interesting so you think if I buy it outright and then just try to sell my my pixel my current pixel phone I could get more money for it assuming that's what that's why I would just buy it outright I didn't think about that but I'll have to see how much they go for okay so let's get all right so Rowan thinks it's not really that big of an upgrade yet yeah I really didn't didn't think that there was that much that was better with the phone yeah I don't know I'll have to look into it more and see if it's if it's better all right so let's get started yesterday I forgot to go over some of the pool requests that we received so at the end after we do the coding but at the beginning that question and answer session I'm gonna try to remember to go over those let's see let's bring over let's bring over our Pomodoro and we have our yeah this is the right I have quite a few terminals open but this is yeah this is the right one okay great let's see not sure what I changed I got rid of okay so I never committed that sorry sorry that I didn't commit that stuff let's see what did we do all right let me start this first thing I'm gonna do is commit some of this stuff to github so you all can can check it out the link to the github repository is in the description for this video now so you'll be able to see everything that working on github also let's get Angra running and let's see I have it yeah so I have things going on on a terminal on another window let me see what's three thousand and one okay all right so I'm going to paste into the live chat the the link so that link should work I will doublecheck as well to make sure it's working okay great so it is working yeah it looks like I could see a lot of activity there so if you're not familiar with this this will allow you to see in real time what's going on when we make changes on your own computer and that way you know you can open up dev tools you can check things out this you won't have I'm I'm not a hundred percent sure about this but potentially let me try this out you might even be able to use the Redux Chrome extension and see if it works stay yeah okay so this actually works so whenever we're creating our store you'll be able to have access to this as well so assuming that you that you get this for Chrome and I don't remember what it's called what did we call it in our at redux dev tools extension all right so I tried redoubts dev tools extension and see if that's the name if it's not let me know I could look up what the name of it was officially so you can get that but that will be really helpful to understand what's going on with with redux okay so let me bring over I'm gonna run on local 3,000 won okay so right now we have the most basic of apps here but we have a couple of routes in here we don't have them length but if we typed it into our address bar we could go to the other routes let me commit and what did we do the we added routes that's about what we did okay so that code is now on github now let's this thing about what we want to do for our for a store so we'll need to think about two things so one what are we going to actually display to the user you know what are we gonna do with the data and then also what's the day that looking like as it's coming in so we're using WordPress as our content management system and we're getting data from the WordPress API so we can check out how that data looks and let me find let me bring up just some sample WordPress API data hmm I know I have a test I'm pretty sure have a test WordPress installation somewhere just for this so let me do a quick check oops I typed in the wrong address here we go I'm gonna pull it I'm doing this on my other screen but I'll pull it over just in a minute when I get the right thing okay awesome let me bring this over okay so here I actually just pulled this off of my own website which if you go there know that I have not updated this for quite a while so the actual design is five years old maybe at least five years old the content has been updated maybe maybe like two and a half years ago and nothing has happened since then so so be kind if you comment on it but I do have some some posts on there so this is what the date is going to look like we can change how this data comes in so if we don't need every bit of this data we can filter that out so this is just an example of the basic data you'd get from the WordPress API if you didn't have anything else running but just the API so no extra plugins no custom post types so we're gonna get an array of objects everything is going to have certainly unique ID the dates those will probably be important to us the only other fields that we really care about would be probably the status right we don't want to pull in drafts the slug we don't we're not worried about the link we want to know the type if we end up having custom post types we definitely want to know what type it is certainly the title and the content not really worried about the excerpt maybe we'll want that but I don't usually use it see we don't need the author we won't need something with the featured media but what I'll probably do is use a plugin so that we can get some better data our categories and tags we will need information on these but again I'll probably use a plugin so we get better data right now we just get the number 43 all right so that means the category with the ID 43 which isn't that helpful I want to know what's the name of the category what's the slug so we'll be doing something different for that and that's about it so a lot of this stuff we won't even worry about but one thing I would like to do once we get this data in is when it's in the store I don't want it just like this what I want it is in the format of and the meeting I'll make this smaller do I really only have two posts I guess so so what I want is to pull the ID so the I assuming the ID numbers are all unique which I'm pretty sure that that is the case we can either use the ID or the slug but for now let's just say we're gonna use the ID so we'll have our array and then we're gonna have key value pairs where the ID becomes the key and then the value is this object okay so what that will allow us to do then is to we'll have our posts in the store and when when we want to pull in more posts and merge those new posts in it will check based on the ID and it will only update it would only add those posts that have a different ID or potentially update the posts that have the same ID and then we can keep the other stuff in the or we'll be able to reference those by ID if we need to so that's the that's basically the structure of the store what I what I wanted to be structured like we're probably going to run into some other things like maybe we'll want to add some data into here that isn't that we can't get from WordPress so if that happens you know we'll deal with that when we get to it but first step is just to bring this data in and then change it to the format that we want so for now I'm just going to use this data from my own website and eventually we'll probably want to bring in some data a you know that's closer to what we're actually going to use but this will work for now so let's get this set up to actually pull in some of the data we'll need to but you can make our API calls so let's pull in let's make another folder so another directory we're going to do this in our source and we're gonna call this leads and then we're gonna we're gonna make a file in there it's gonna be let's call this actually let me double check I want I'd like to use the same naming conventions that I've been using for my previous read up project Redux project just to make it consistent so I'm gonna bring this up on my other screen and github and if you want to check it out that's the Udacity react and the readable project on my github profile which I'll just post the link into the live chat so this will be an example of the entire redux app that's already finished and working so our app that we're building won't look exactly like this but it will share some elements okay so let's go with those okay so now that we have this all everything that we're going to need to get data from WordPress we're going to put in here so that'll keep it separate and it won't clutter up our other our other files so let's go with there's some words press I'm gonna exports let's call this stretch pose and we're gonna use fetch so if you're not familiar with the fetch API this is a way to make basically what you would use Ajax for or some people use Axios there's some other libraries I guess that can do the same thing but fetch is it's it's newer I mean it's been around for a while but it's newer and I I like using it I think it's very simple so check it out if you if you haven't used it yet you're definitely gonna see an example of using it here and we've used it for I think all of the projects that we've needed to make an API call for that we've worked on on this stream we've used fetch for that so let's let's get our URL and what I put that I cannot find where I put the data I losing my mind here I hope I didn't there we go here's alright so here is our data and so we're just gonna grab that is that's where we need to make the call so we're gonna fetch that and we shouldn't need I don't think we need any headers with this we'll try it without it if we end up needing some I'll go back and check out some of the code from a previous project and just see how we did it from on that project we should be able to just go from here and then we're gonna have our data and let's go all right such a sum and that's it I think that's all we need for right now we may grab some some different things here so this is probably not all we're gonna do but this will work for now so let's save that and then let's connect this so we're going to connect this into our actions so let's find some actions as our reducers oh here I already had the actions up so here's our actions so what we'll do is we're gonna make C we're gonna have to import what we had just done here import from eatos okay so now we've imported this and then right now we only have one export but when you put this here that is just going to bring in all the exports so correct me if I'm wrong on that but that's why we're just bringing it in I'm anticipating possibly having more here so I'm just going to do it like this right off the bat okay so now I'm gonna bring in let's make sure let's go with okay so we're bringing in the dispatch because we're in it after we make the API call we're gonna dispatch this action so it'll be kind of a twostep process so from our component we're gonna dispatch this action that's why we're exporting this then it's gonna make the API call get the data and then pass that data as posts into this action when it dispatches that action okay and then from here it's gonna go to the reducers so that's what we're gonna do so let's go what we call this post API until and then we're gonna go fetch posts right so from the post API util we're calling fetch post and then we don't need to pass anything right so everything it needs is right here and then let me go then then we want our posts here and let's just we're gonna dispatch get posts and we do need to pass it our posts it's so probably not formatted in the best way but we'll get our Auto formatting and I did not set up the plugin and Adam to do the formatting for me yet but when we commit we'll get our formatting okay I think that's everything I need let's save it just see if we get any errors yep we did okay import and body of module reorder to the top okay so what did I do I need to import at the top okay all right if that's our only error then I'm fine with that okay great so now that we have that done we actually need to call this from from inside of a component so let's go to our home our home page and if you remember we took out part of this here so we're gonna need to put that back in so let me grab it so I have it in another repository I'm just going to copy and paste it from there okay so actually I'll type this out cuz it'll be easier for me to explain it I think if I if I type it it might be I don't know I think it'd be easier to comprehend if we go step by step instead of me pasting a bunch of stuff in there all at once so we're gonna go map dispatch to props and then we can let's use this here all right so now we'll have dispatch available in our props and then also I'm gonna say fetch data and we're going to let's see do we need to pass now we don't eat we're not gonna pass anything right now we're in a dispatch fetch post and that's where we're gonna make that that call now we need to import fetch posts so let's bring that in oh actually and I I did not I just commented that out alright so now we can bring in fetch posts from actions right so in our actions we're exporting fetch posts and on let's see mounts uh this Frost fetch fetch data okay so let's make sure fetch data if it's David dispatch fetch props fetch pose okay alright let's see if this works make sure I save these two and we'll give it a shot alright what do we have here this processed data is another function what did I get wrong oh okay I never brought in map dis bastard props here so I didn't need to bring this in as well map dispatched across there we go let's see alright great so now you don't have the error let's check our store there we go cool so you can see under receive posts we now have our data and this data can be available to any component and so all we have to do is since this is in the stores you know just pull in our data we can Mack state two props and and have that available so we can even see so within our component state yeah why is react not turning on hmm so for some reason area for some reason it wasn't working when I was clicking on the dropdown but let's go in here um if we check out or so we have our dispatch a fetch data where we got as a tier where some states I'm a machine actually this is odd I should be able to see the state around I should be able to see it in props what am I missing here okay maybe it's did I forget did I forget to start my timer or did it go off and I didn't hear it okay so I'm definitely gonna take I'm gonna take my short break now new question answer so sorry about that obviously it's been longer than 25 minutes so alright so I'm gonna take a break from that for just a second and if it's not clear what I'm worried about is I I expected to see something different for props so maybe I'm just mistaken but we'll check that out in a few minutes so I'm going way up to the top of the live chat I'm just gonna work my way down look for questions or any comments that you know pertaining to this part of the project and then later on I'll go over all the rest of it when we're done with the coding portion Skaar no asks are you going to write tests I would like to write some tests I'm not great with writing tests so I'm gonna have to think about how I'd want to write those what I'm gonna use and then learn how to do it so so I'd like to but I haven't made any decisions regarding that yet Cronus says when we use C++ for this project for this project which is project for I'm not going to be using C++ I for project 3 which will be going back to occasionally we are using csharp but I don't have any projects where I'm currently using C++ let's see alright so Marco says hi Jesse first time here finally I catch you streaming greetings from Brazil hey how's it going I noticed you had a comment on the last video saying that you never get to catch the live stream so really glad that you could be involved in the live stream today so feel free to ask any questions or you know throw your opinion in in there in the live chat si all right so I'm not gonna read this person's name so they don't get in any legal trouble but someone keeps asking how to hack a facebook account without a phishing page I am NOT going to answer that question so normally I answer any questions but that that question seems like the type of question that will not lead to anything good so so sorry about that but we're not going to talk about hacking Facebook pages on this stream so if you do want to stick around to the person that's talking about hacking Facebook pages if you do want to stick around watch the stream ask some other questions not related to hacking that's awesome if if you keep asking the hacking question over and over again then I don't want to maybe I'll block I don't know it depends if there's a huge wall of questions then maybe it would be too much but it looks like as I'm scrolling down there's not a lot of questions we'll see okay nice or asked is your asp.net core project three for beginners I see a lot of complication in that project some of that project is definitely could be for beginners it's just you know kind of basic just building a layout HTML CSS the parts of the project where we're actually going through some of the csharp and trying to build out the templates could be a little bit more complicated it just depends on your background I guess but I have I have a different approach to that project that so the next time we do a stream for project three I'll introduce kind of my new approach that will allow it to be a little bit more interactive and allow me to accept full requests and things so so maybe that'll make it a little bit more beginner friendly hopefully it will all right so jonbi loves the minimal design so far home this is the home page yeah I just want to be userfriendly and as straightforward as possible so I didn't want there to be any confusion that that's the home page all right david says where are you from Jessie I guess South actually so right now I'm in Steubenville Ohio but I grew up in West Virginia but probably not the type of West Virginia that you think of when you think of stereotypical West Virginia so I grew up in the most northern part of West Virginia which is actually about 20 minutes away from Pittsburgh it's right there on the same latitude of Pittsburgh so anyway so that's where I'm Betsy I'm from actually the city where I'm from according to Jeopardy at Alex Trebek is the only city in the United States that borders two different states so the part of the city that I lived in the end of my street was Pennsylvania and then the other side of the city borders the Ohio River and of course the state of Ohio so anyway I could at one point I could walk in my backyard and and go into Pennsylvania right through my backyard so I always thought that was kind of cool I used to stand on that spot and say like I'm in between states anyway but that's around froth let me see my huh my time I went off I for some reason it's not beeping it used to beep in my I could hear in my headphones so I'm just gonna have to make sure I keep checking this because I'm not getting that that beeping sound I'm gonna refresh just see if it helps okay let's see I'm gonna come back I did notice Williams says nice about page photo I don't remember what photo that is I'm gonna check it on my other screen and quickly cuz now I wonder what picture I have on there oh man that's what I had my hair longer I need to change that so I'm not gonna show that on the stream you're welcome to look it up if you want but uh huh I need I need to do something else with that site okay so back to coding to restart our timer and alright let me think what is Cephas okay that makes sense Steve see this was that my problem hmm there we go okay now we have it so now you can see in the props for home we have posts and that's because we brought in here this part of the state right receive post as posts okay so the problem there was just that I had the wrong the wrong word there okay great so we're bringing this data in now at this point we could display it you know on the page but I want to change the structure of it so there's really no point in doing anything to display it right now because that that wouldn't worry I just I just check the live chat and it looks like a few of you have have checked out that photo so let's see okay so let's in our reducers we're so reducers here we go all right so we're gonna handle restructuring things in our reducers so if if you're checking out the other github repo that I'm getting a lot of these examples from you can check out the reducers now and that's where I'm going to get some some of the basic meal code from to do this okay so right now you can see we have our posts and it's just it's just in an array right so we have 0 and 1 and then our objects as I said earlier instead of the 0 & 1 what I really want is to have the basically change this into an object with key value pairs okay so here's what I'm gonna do to make that happen so within our reducers I'm gonna make a little helper function now I'm not sure if this is the best place to put this if it might be better to make this a separate component but for now I'm gonna put it in here and we can you know later on think about whether or not we want to put it in a different component okay so I'm just gonna call this function make object because that's basically what it's gonna do it's gonna take it and it's its form as an array all right we're going to turn it into an object and we're gonna bring in our items so for now it's gonna be post but potentially we could do this with anything so just kind of generically we'll call it items and we're gonna make a new object and we're just gonna set that to be an empty object for now and then I'm just going to do a really simple for loop there might be a better way to do it that probably is but for loops easy to understand it's easy for me and probably easy for a lot of the people watching I know before I got better with some of the newer Java scripts a lot of the tutorials that I read that used the newer stuff were very confusing because of just the newer syntax the concepts I think would have been a lot easier to get if it weren't for the newer syntax so ideal usually the newer syntax for a lot of things but in this case hopefully it makes it a little bit more user friendly okay so basic loop we're going to grab our items we want items dot length I could remember items is coming in as an array yeah and we're just gonna go through the items okay so we did use let's so if you're not familiar with that we're using let in constant set of variables so instead of you know var right we're using constant this is a constant and then let now I'm not gonna go into everything about these but basically you make a constant and you try to mutate that constant later on you're going to get an error for the most part with let you can change what let is obviously but its scoped that it's block scoped right so I could use let here and then I could use let in another for loop right I could use or I'm sorry I could use let I equals whatever in a lot of different places since it's block scoped it would be fine I don't have to come up with different variables for iterators I mean that's not the main reason why you would use let but in this case I think it's just kind of an easy way to kind of show the block scoping alright so within this for loop we're gonna do I'm gonna make some more constants if you're not sure about Wendy use cost and when do you slet generally of from my experience and from what I've been told from others you should pretty much use cost by default and then you only use let if you really need to use let let's see okay so we have our items so we're gonna grab the ID equals I don't I D whoa it's not what I wanted I'd be alright so we're not finished yet but just so far to show so we're iterating over these so we're getting our items so for this particular you know for each particular run through this loop our item is just going to be that that item or the at that position in the array they were going to grab our ID I'll do want to double check in the data structure I think it's ID but let's double check so that doesn't cause problems yeah ID okay so we're gonna grab the ID which for our first one will be 772 then what we want to do is get our new object and we're gonna go item ID equals item right so here's what we're doing so I don't want to confuse anyone so we made this constant right and I just said that you can't mutate a constant but in this case if we're adding things to an object that's a constant right that's that will work but I couldn't say new object equals a string called called what it called string right and then down here say a new object equals five okay that did we get an error on that alright so then our new object needs to be returned so what this will do is take well I'll show you let me show you the data and then it'll be obvious what it does so let's save that and let's call this from inside our receive posts so instead of merging the state with just action dot posts which is just the data we're getting in from the API we're gonna change that data a little bit by merging it what we get returned from make objects so let's say that now now let's check out our store there we go so you see the difference now so now we have our object right this is no longer an array this is an object with key value pairs and our keys are the IDS and then the value is all the rest of the the data for that item okay and then so now that you've seen it you can tell right that's that's just what we've done right we broke it down that that array and instead we've made in an object with the ID right as the key and then everything else as the value okay now here's here's the thing this is going to be actually I guess some stuff coming alive chat so let's see a shorter version okay cool so kevin is typing out in the live chat a shorter version so let's go ahead and refactor this right now for the shorter version so hopefully you kind of understood what was going on here it may or may not be easier to understand it once we refactor so let's do that now okay so in our for loop we're going to use a for loop okay so it's going to be for item okay so our four of loop is we're just making whatever we can this could be whatever we want to call it okay but we're calling it item of and then we're pulling in our items array here so for item of items so within here item is gonna basically be that the same thing as it was before but that's a little bit of a shorter way to write that that for loop and I would say honestly if you were just starting out I think this makes more sense in terms of explaining what's happening then then the other way we did the for loop with the iterator all right and we're gonna shorten this up by saying new object item ID let's see so we can get rid of this right because now we've taken care of it up here and then we can also get rid of this because we've moved it down to here so a lot shorter so let's save that and then it works yeah all right cool cool okay thank you Kevin definitely definitely shorter and more concise is usually almost always better alright great so now that we have that let's um let me check how much time we have okay ten minutes okay not bad let's actually get some of this onto the page so as much as this design now is is amazing in minimal I think it might be more helpful to the users if we displayed a bit more information I don't know about you but I don't know how many times I would come back to this page you know I just probably could remember that this is the home page so we're gonna put some more info on there now let's go to our home page and we're going to make a more proper return so we're going to eat we're gonna use the oldschool way of returning not this newfangled react 16 way so oh wow did Sebastian typed up an even shorter way of doing this all right let me copy and paste this alright let's check out Sebastian's even shorter way and I will I'm gonna paste this in right above at first just so we can compare okay so here we go so we have cost make object and we're using an arrow function so we're passing in items and then we have our new object we're mapping over our items and then we're making our key value pairs and returning the new objects so let me see is that really is that really shorter let's uh let's break this down a bit just to compare if this would really be that much shorter so how would I normally do this new objects yeah I guess that's how I would break this up okay all right so once I space this out it actually ends up being the same amount of lines all right so let's see I'm gonna move on from this because I mean I like this this is cool but we're gonna run out of time and not be able to display any data so yeah so map would normally be able to auto return these so do we even need well I guess right we don't want to we don't want to just return this each time I mean as as the Kim the entire thing all right I'll let you all discuss it discuss this in more depth for now let's comment one of them out so that we can work on this all right five minutes six minutes almost okay so let's let's bring in okay so we're already getting we know we're already getting the data in here it's getting passed in as props post and let's hmm all right so first thing we're gonna do is let's make a div just to be a container and then within there we're going to map let's give this propos'd and so we're gonna check if if this props posts is is there then we're gonna do is go objects okay so I'm gonna this is gonna seem weird but we're gonna change this back into an array because I want to be able to use map and filter and sort on this so we're gonna change this back and then we're gonna filter actually do we need to filter right now now I mean at some point we will be filtering these but right now I don't think we need to worry about that so let's go Matt hose most and within here for now let's just do an h1 and we'll give it a key of post dot dot ID and then we're gonna put in the post dot title rendered okay so that rendered isn't anything special that's just the way the data is organized in WordPress let's try that out it should work No what'd I do wrong let's check it out hmm nothing I already yes oops posts that's the problem yeah that's it all right so you can see that the only problem was I I forgot the s on the end so first it was checking if this props post exists and that doesn't exist right so there we go okay cool so now we can see we're able to use map and we could also use filter and sort which i think is a lot easier to work with which is the whole reason for this for changing this so that we can work with it here now we have our titles and actually I wonder I wonder if I could just display I can't cattle I there's got to be some way to turn this into the string isn't it like stringify something I see sorry I didn't check out the live chat you all saw ahead of time what what the problem was let's see so I could do let's see if that'll give us something all right cool okay so this looks really ugly but just to show you we're just trying to show you what what comes out here and in terms of what's getting passed so I still have thought about it I always get nice formatting because I have this plugin with JSON so now this is pretty much unreadable but anyway let's get back to something we're readable okay I'm pretty sure I've used up my time for that Pomodoro session I've lost my where my head I'm getting something from what did I do okay I didn't go back far enough there we go all right and there yeah so my timer is up so I'm gonna go to the live chat and let's see I'm gonna scroll back up to where I left off and if if you can't stick around for the question answer session I totally understand but if you can if you have some time I'd love it if you could help answer some questions or ask some questions of your own but otherwise thanks for watching and I'll be back again tomorrow probably around 2 p.m. Eastern Time so let's go or I'll be left alright so I'm just going to go down through the list and answer hopefully have time to answer all the questions I know yesterday I had to cut it off you know pretty quickly when I got to the bottom of the questions but today I haven't gotten any messages from my boss so I should be okay let's see it's about Paige all right there's some some more comments on my about page photo ok so John BS he Jumby says I haven't worked with redux myself before what is the slug supposed to be the slug isn't a Redux thing okay and it's like William already answered so it's a wordpress thing yeah so the in WordPress normally I well there's several different ways you can have the URLs display but the best I think the best way to do it is have the slug be part of the URL so whatever the slug is for that post ends up being what's after the slash and your URL and it's it's also unique identifier for for the posts and pages have their own slugs I've had some requests to speak Hindi unfortunately I cannot speak Hindi so apologize for that although if someone would like to translate these streams into Hindi and have them available as captions that would be awesome that would probably be a lot of work but it would be a good way to contribute to free code camp so if you're interested that's that's definitely an area where where we need more volunteers not just for Hindi but for any any language all right okay John Hanson asks if fetch is supported on all current browsers I think actually I haven't even checked I always use a polyfill so I can't answer that that question because it doesn't really matter to me because I use the polyfill so that's what my recommendation anyway if you're going to use fetch use a polyfill with it and and then you have to worry about it but I do think browsers are I'm pretty sure chrome can handle fetch but I guess it's worth checking it might be good to know and here we go if you're not familiar with can I use calm definitely a good site to memorize that URL it's really easy can I use calm and then you just type in whatever thing you're trying to use whether it be in JavaScript or CSS and you'll immediately get this chart so we can see if you want to use fetch obviously ie11 doesn't support it because it doesn't support anything edge Firefox Chrome Safari Opera iOS Safari even while Android Chrome for Android so basically it will work except for Opera Mini and Internet Explorer 11 and it has been supported even in previous versions of Safari and Chrome and Firefox so awesome so evidently chrome is or fetch is pretty usable right now it certainly depends on what you need to support them let's see William a little while back said we'd love to continue watching but it's meeting time so probably not watching right now but good luck with the meeting and thanks for watching and contributing in the live chat Kevin I'm so sorry so I just read a few comments after the original question about fetch Kevin said for compatibility questions Google can I use and then the feature name so anyway so sorry Kevin that I just tried to tell everybody about this when you already had so Kevin was on top of things that Marco says Axios or fetch which is best for big JSON files I I'd never used Axios so I don't know but Roland says go with Axios if you want backwards compatibility otherwise fetch is good jonbi says you might want to chain another dot then method to catch any errors in the event that the fetch request fails to retrieve the data okay yeah that's that's a good idea Jumby so what wolf to add that and I'm not gonna go back right now but yeah definitely normally you wouldn't want to like if for something that's in production you do want to catch errors so he's talking about here when we did our fats we would want to add in another then and then catch errors like that and possibly you know do something with the error right when you display a message or whatever however you want to handle that there's actually there's I've seen some interesting ways to handle errors when fetching data with with Redux so maybe for the next stream I'm gonna look up some of that and we can implement something something like that Marco says I'm developing my portfolio right now I was using preact and that's frustrating so I decided to use react instead react is a good choice for something like Israel is react a good choice or something like a small portfolio Relan says that react is probably overkill for small websites it doesn't mean you can't do it if you're comfortable react go for it so yeah yeah it depends on what you're doing in your portfolio site hmm so I I look tired yeah it depends on I guess on what you're doing I mean a portfolio site could be really simple one page thing or it I mean some people's portfolios are amazing you know they're like a work of art and they you're displaying their skills right so I wouldn't say right off the bat Reax overkill for a portfolio because it entirely depends on what you're trying to do with your portfolio if you want to market yourself as a react developer why not do your portfolio and react then your portfolio itself is going to be evidence of your skills at reacts even if it's overkill right so or if you want to learn react if you're trying to get better with react then yeah make your portfolio with react it will it be overkill probably but it'll get you practice with something that's kind of simple just to get you used to using your so if the question is simply is it overkill the answer is probably yes but if the question is should I use it then yeah I mean I would say there's nothing wrong with with using it if you want to if that's what you want to do if that's what you want to learn let's see okay so Kevin says is an alternative next j/s is an easy way to set up a site with react yeah definitely I definitely recommend that so one good thing about next is you don't have to worry about routing so if you're just doing a very simple site you didn't need any custom stuff going on and in the backend then you just have as a code your views folder I think maybe it's the pages folder so anyway there's a folder that you use a next and any components you put in that folder automatically it'll route to those so it takes care of routing for you it takes care of serverside rendering for you so it handles a lot of things you know like right now we're using react router and we're handing in our routing now it's not hard but that's just one extra thing that you have to learn so if you're just starting out and it's something simple next is probably the way to go because it handles so many things for you it's much easier to learn I think with next create react app is also pretty easy to learn but it doesn't do quite as much for you as next does okay Blake says in response to the same question here just go with plain bootstrap in HTML you're just building a portfolio by doing so you'll save a lot of time for another bigger project with react okay that's that's another viewpoint I hadn't even thought of yes so if if you just want to move on to make something really cool with react then maybe you just throw together that portfolio with the basic tools write HTML bootstrap or something like bootstrap yeah and then do something else with react so I get kind of does depend on how much time you want to put into this as well Rowen says I support going with vanilla JavaScript and add libraries to the project if you need them view if you really want to play with a framework okay also when we use the term vanilla JavaScript I know most of you probably know what that means but I saw I don't remember if it's a comment on a video or something but I saw somewhere where someone didn't know what vanilla JavaScript meant so just in case I want to explain that so vanilla JavaScript just means regular plain JavaScript with no other frameworks or libraries added in so it's as then like vanilla is usually seen as like the plain I mean even though technically Benelli is a flavor right it's plain so like vanilla ice cream is plain alright it's it's not chocolate or you know like rocky road ice cream yourself you know it's just the plain so that's what I mean by vanilla JavaScript let's see Leon says how how do you get posts in your component you didn't pass it to the store through the reducer or did I miss something okay let me let me see so let me just walk through some of these steps just an answer to this question just to show what what happened so so let's start out with at home so in our component here in our home component when the component mounts were fetching the data all right so we're dispatching this action to fetch posts let's go to our actions now so oops it's our reduces our actions are over here so fetch posts makes the API call here this API call returns our data all right and then all right we're returning you know data to JSON ultimately so that gets out here so that's what goes in here to this then as posts so this that is getting passed on its dispatching get posts so now that data the post data goes here from here this is where I serve reducers okay our reducers take over and then in so we're bringing in get posts from actions so when get posts is past then it's also passing in all that post data right from here and we're passing that through of course our make object function and returning our new object with our key value pairs that gets merged with whatever was in the state so this is what ends up going into the store and now we go back to the home component and now whatever was in the store as receive posts now becomes posts in our props for this component so that's basically the flow is there other stuff going on behind the scenes yeah definitely but we don't have to worry about that because Redux takes care of that for us so hopefully that was somewhat intelligible I don't know that I'm the best person to explain that but hopefully that helped let's see uh gto says will man stop being rude to people let them be was I being rude I don't see anybody in the comments that was being rude so maybe I was being rude let me know if I was I'm sorry uh let's see yes een says how much javascript should I know to learn any JavaScript framework Oh I honestly if we want to take framework loosely and just include like any framework like thing or library which I don't want to get into beta for framework versus library now but let's just say you could use jQuery without knowing very much at all about JavaScript it's really easy if you wanted to get something into something a little bit more advanced like react or angular I would say you'd have to have more knowledge about JavaScript but I don't think that you should wait to become a JavaScript expert before you move into a framework because they can handle so many things for you that there's really not there's value I guess in knowing how to do it but it's it's almost like a waste of effort to try to redo things in vanilla JavaScript that are already being done really well and have been tested thoroughly by you know in frameworks so I think at some point you learn the basics of JavaScript and then move into a framework and then continue to build up your knowledge of JavaScript as you do you do things right so I I was looking back at our project one and some of the code for that earlier I was making some updates to it and just looking at that already and that's only been you know a few months ago already my knowledge of JavaScript has increased so much but I've been building everything in react so yes I've been using reacts but my JavaScript has gotten better as a result so you know you can do both you can build up your skills in JavaScript while you're using framework a library so I'd say like if you get to the point where you understand enough JavaScript to be able to understand how to use the framework then go for it just remember that frameworks come and go so don't stop improving your JavaScript because that's what will get you through you know the shifting of frameworks and you'll be able to keep up with things better i josh says Ohi all right maybe josh is from ohio as well yeah so although I live in Ohio now I am still a mountaineer at heart so from west west virginians the the one like big college football team in the state of West Virginia's mascot is a mountaineer so that's why I say I'm a mountaineer at hearts okay Rohan says that is a nice photo the the photo of my on my website Blake says lovely photo Sebastian says yep great photo Kevin likes it too thanks everybody thanks I don't know I think I look kind of silly with my hair long but oh well jonbi said I think your phone is ringing my phone was ringing but I think it was a spam caller so if anyone ever tries to call me leave a message because I never answered my phone unless I know who it is because I just get so many spam callers so like it's just it's a waste of time to keep answering their phone that's John be said for the home page to make it a giant heart image because home is where the heart is that's a good idea maybe we'll throw that in okay he had some discussion over the best way to do that make object function that we had in our in our reducers so I'm gonna skip over that although that was a good discussion but let's see I think it would be hard to understand if I just try to read out all the code that's being posted for that see so what a lot of discussions still about that so I'm scrolling down I'm looking for another question okay so Matt set for the API call you can use async/await instead of then okay cool so yeah Matt if you're still watching look into a sink away okay so I see your further comments on that all right I'll have to look into that so in general is is async await a better way to do this then then then so if anybody has any opinion on that let me know I'll definitely check that out I'd like to do it the most efficient way I can Marko's asks if i'm using material UI or something like that i will be using the tear UI for this project so I haven't decided yet whether I'm going to use the newer version of material UI or the older version we'll see if you remember for our last project at the beginning they just came out with material UI and we tried to use it on like the first day it came out or at least the first week and had some trouble with it and switched back to the old version so I don't know well that's yet to be decided but we're definitely going to use material UI in some form let's see okay so jumpy says if I use json.stringify and then I would have done post common okoma it would indent the JSON values by two spaces and it would be more readable cool I didn't know that awesome I mean I don't usually have to use json stringify to display stuff but that's that's really good to know for what I do so deep says how do i code the minimax algorithm for tictactoe I mean I understand the concept of having trouble coding any tips I haven't actually worked on that one myself so I can't help you out i watch the video on it if you're not familiar with that so Bo did a video on making a tictactoe game in JavaScript so it sits here on the free code camp so I I haven't tried to get myself so I don't know that I can answer that maybe if anyone else in the live chat now has has worked on that you know maybe maybe you could add something here in the chat should come with us is this playlist a little more advanced than playlist let me think what was play this what projects was that the Resource Center yeah hmm yeah this is going to be a little more advanced only because we're using redux so it's going to see more advanced but I think it's gonna help it's going to help us a lot more with with handling our data so if you remember in project one we were making similar API calls to WordPress so it's going to be a nice comparison to see basically to make a similar app using in the first case in project one not not using Redux we use next to bootstrap the project and then instead in this project we're still going to be making the same API calls doing a lot of the same things with the data but we're going to use Redux and then we've also used create react app or use react router so it's going to be doing this it's very similar things both using react but in two different ways of using react so I think it'll be cool it'll be a nice comparison piloff says just want to say thank you so much if you drop by India and New Delhi let me know I will be more than happy to treat you for all the effort oh that's awesome thank you so much cool so I don't have any plans to go to India right now but you never know maybe I'll see if there's any conferences JavaScript conferences in India and maybe all apply to speak there I've actually never been outside of my own country so that would be it would be cool India would most definitely be the farthest away I've ever been see oh also I did want to mention it I think I mentioned this last week at some point but I will be in Nashville Tennessee here in the United States at the end of November I think it's November 27th and 28th so if any of you are in that area let me know if you if you'd like to meet up you know somewhere and that that would be cool I'm gonna go to the November conference that's going to be in in Nashville so if you can make it to the conference that would be cool as well but I'll only be there for maybe like two or three days so we won't have a lot of time but it but it would be cool if anybody's interested let me know birdperson says hello hi campers how you doing Jesse not bad not bad so it was somewhat productive today so that's always good nice are says what CSS framework are you going to use let's try Bulma I was actually going to use material UI so I know I just said that and I know you'd asked the question before I mentioned that so I've never used one before I've heard it's been recommended before in the live chat so actually I don't know let me know is is boom ah does it play nice with reacts I'm gonna look this up right now okay all right so it looks like it's it's like bootstrap interesting okay so yeah actually Bouma looks really cool but I for this project I'm gonna go with materiai especially because we're gonna want to keep the same user interface as basically what we're gonna replace so we already have a bulletin site that is in use right now and it's going to be replaced with what we build right now but I'd like to keep a similar UI and it's already using material design style so it'd be much easier to recreate that if we go with material UI but I'll keep bulla in mind for a future project especially maybe for a side project for projects for the university that I work for which these are the projects that I always stream I'd like to keep things a little bit more consistent to make it easier for not just for me but for other people who might have to come in and work on these projects like if we hired new people on or if some happens to me and they replace me I think would be easier to have more consistency with things but I'm open to trying out new things when I can see all right so so back sebastien basically just explained what I just said so he said all the websites for the university that he works for fall is material design guidelines see how that's Therese but if any then Sebastian added at least the new ones the old websites are a mess I'm not gonna argue with the old websites are there was no consistency at all in the design and I don't know I'm not gonna say anything else but that's the nicest way I could say it is that there there wasn't consistency let's see okay david says for catching errors in the fetch it would be better to use dot catch instead of dot then okay cool I have to check that out okay so Kevin says that it using async/await is generally better to use with fetch so okay okay so Marco says there is a project that reacted boom ah you I so okay so we could try that for a react project so like I said for this one we need to go with material design but you know potentially for other projects we could switch it up and try that out so thanks for letting me know about that Marco and also Nasir I think it was yet nice our mentioned that as well earlier in the stream okay cool so Kevin has put some code in there for the to use async async await with our fetch so thanks for that Kevin let's try that after the stream depending on what time it is yeah I might I'll probably have time see alright and Matt says don't forget the catch okay cool I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat so gonna end things now if anybody has any other questions outside of the live chat in the livestream time we have a slack Channel and I don't remember I think the slack Channel we have we have a link to that in the description otherwise let me know send me a message or something and I can send you the link so we have a slack channel you can send me messages on Twitter or any other social media platform and of course you can put comments to the videos you can you can certainly put issues and all the github repo submit pull requests if you would like and use any of the repos you want take take any of the code and use it on your own projects so does this lack Oh Marcus says the slack doesn't work the link for slack doesn't work okay I'll have to look into that thanks for letting me know I'll check into the slack to see what what the problem is okay cool I'll have to get a better lengthen so yeah I didn't know so I'll work on that I'll do that right now before I forget so as soon as I end the stream I'll check out what's going on with that link and try to get an actual working link in there for the slack channel all right so thanks everybody for watching and have a lot of activity in the live chat which is awesome it's always it's always great when everybody's helping each other out and let's see I will be back tomorrow I'm just checking my calendar quickly cuz I don't I don't think I've checked my calendar at all yet today and yeah I think I'm free tomorrow afternoon so probably 2 p.m. eastern time tomorrow we'll be back I'm thinking we'll probably work on this project again unless something
