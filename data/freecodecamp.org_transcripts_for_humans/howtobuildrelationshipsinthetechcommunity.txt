00:00 - i'm basically going to speak about
00:01 - relationship building in the iit
00:03 - community so the first thing i'll say is
00:06 - a lot of us can be really shy or
00:09 - introverts here in the community i took
00:11 - the myers-briggs test in college and i
00:14 - came back
00:15 - about as introvert as you can possibly
00:19 - come back and i have lots and lots of
00:21 - friends in the tecla homa community my
00:23 - husband who's actually at my desk right
00:25 - now at star space 46 he's actually
00:27 - really shy he also has relationships in
00:30 - the i.t community so you can be shy you
00:32 - can be an introvert you can still build
00:34 - lots of relationships and part of the
00:36 - thing about building relationships in
00:38 - the tecla home and community it's about
00:40 - building real genuine relationships
00:42 - sometimes you go to events that aren't
00:44 - for it and it's about networking it's
00:47 - kind of awkward and you don't know who
00:48 - to talk to
00:49 - it's a lot of really great people here
00:52 - in the community that you can build
00:53 - relationships with so real quick why
00:55 - would you want to build relationships
00:57 - one it can be really fun you can also
01:00 - learn your skills faster and then it
01:01 - might also help you find a job later so
01:03 - just for fun we've got a lot of people
01:05 - here for example that are trying to
01:06 - learn web development they either want
01:09 - to become a developer or you're already
01:10 - a developer you've kind of got something
01:12 - already built in but you might find
01:14 - someone that also likes stargate or star
01:16 - trek discovery or some kind of other
01:18 - interest that you have
01:19 - another thing it can help you learn your
01:21 - skills faster so for example jesse
01:23 - harland teclahoma foundation president
01:26 - he's really amazing with javascript we
01:28 - first met actually at a sql event
01:31 - actually we started chatting and he
01:33 - actually helped me out with some
01:35 - javascript with jquery when jquery was
01:37 - really popular so you can also like
01:40 - learn your skills faster
01:42 - and then also it can help you in your
01:43 - job search so
01:45 - you're looking for a new job or you're
01:46 - looking for that first job you can start
01:48 - asking people hey you know i'm looking
01:50 - for a job
01:51 - what are some of the really awesome
01:52 - companies to work for in oklahoma city
01:55 - or tulsa or wherever you're looking or
01:57 - if it's someone that knows you pretty
01:58 - well hey what places do you think would
02:00 - be a great fit for me we're going to
02:02 - hear a presentation later talking about
02:04 - the right company for you there are so
02:05 - many different size companies there are
02:06 - different cultures and different size
02:08 - companies that are right fits for people
02:10 - so that's a conversation that you can
02:12 - get going now one thing i would say with
02:14 - respect to resumes i would typically let
02:17 - someone offer to take your resume and
02:19 - pass it around it can be kind of an
02:21 - awkward conversation if someone is like
02:24 - hey kristen um i know you work at such
02:26 - and such company and could you pass my
02:28 - resume along i've actually had that
02:30 - happen like at a sunday school before
02:32 - was someone that i had never met before
02:34 - and they were wanting me to pass their
02:35 - resume along and the first impression i
02:37 - got from them is they might not be a
02:39 - right culture fit for the company i was
02:40 - at so it was kind of an awkward
02:42 - conversation you also may have someone
02:45 - hey they work at company a you want to
02:46 - work at company a they may be thinking
02:49 - company is horrible they want to leave
02:51 - company a and they may not want to pass
02:53 - your resume along because
02:55 - they don't think you're a good fit there
02:57 - because they don't like the company so
02:59 - that's one thing i would say with
03:00 - resumes is you you potentially will have
03:02 - people offer to pass your resume along
03:04 - but i would say that's kind of the one
03:05 - thing let someone volunteer to do that
03:07 - for you
03:08 - now on the note for job search my last
03:10 - three corporate jobs that i have had all
03:12 - came through people i knew
03:13 - one of them was people i knew from a
03:15 - previous employer they loved where they
03:17 - were at they were trying to recruit me
03:18 - when i was looking to to leave where i
03:20 - was at gave them a call when they had an
03:22 - opening they gave me a call
03:25 - like the position was pretty much mine
03:26 - to lose at that point
03:28 - the second case was a case where it was
03:30 - actually a recruiter from a staffing
03:31 - firm that you'll see that will sponsor
03:33 - some events in this case she went on to
03:36 - work to devon energy i was interested in
03:38 - working at devon energy gave her a call
03:40 - and she pretty much took my resume went
03:42 - past the first screen immediately to the
03:44 - hiring manager and then my most recent
03:46 - corporate job that i was at because now
03:48 - i have my own consultancy was someone
03:50 - i'd known in the community for more than
03:52 - 10 years like before it was even the
03:53 - tecla home and committee he took my
03:55 - resume and passed it along so the people
03:58 - that you know can be great resources for
04:00 - helping find a job even though that's
04:02 - not why we're really building the
04:04 - relationships long term you can have
04:06 - those conversations
04:08 - so how can you build relationships if
04:10 - you're new one of the things that
04:12 - meetups is that i oftentimes try to do
04:14 - is sit next to people that i've never
04:16 - met before so i sat next to marcus in
04:18 - the back had a great conversation with
04:19 - him hadn't met him before that was
04:21 - really great i could have sat next to
04:23 - kimberly who i've known for several
04:24 - years but i wouldn't have met anyone
04:26 - else new and kimberly and i can talk on
04:28 - slack whenever we want to so that's one
04:30 - of the things i try to do at conferences
04:32 - which can be a little bit bigger
04:35 - also sitting people next to you that you
04:36 - don't know can be really beneficial now
04:39 - one thing for people that are new or not
04:41 - new that's kind of starting to take hold
04:43 - at conferences is people are coming up
04:46 - with the idea of basically forming a use
04:48 - so if you've got like
04:50 - kimberly and i and carson i believe like
04:52 - if we were having a conversation and we
04:54 - wanted like other people to join our
04:56 - conversation we would like i guess in
04:58 - our case form a triangle but kind of
05:00 - like a you that would show hey we've got
05:02 - space in our group so you can come up
05:04 - and join that conversation if two more
05:07 - people joined that conversation then
05:08 - we'd form a u make sure we don't have a
05:10 - circle so that new people can come up so
05:12 - i'd say if here at a conference
05:14 - definitely look for people that are in
05:16 - that you format and if you're someone
05:17 - that's not new to conferences and you
05:19 - want people to come up and join your
05:20 - group i'd highly recommend forming that
05:23 - use you can have more people come up and
05:24 - talk to you so that's basically my talk
05:27 - on building relationships
