00:00 - I want to begin this video by reviewing
00:02 - our definitions of the union and
00:04 - intersection after that I'll be
00:06 - introducing two algebraic laws for sets
00:09 - so the definition of a union b equals
00:13 - set containing elements X such that X is
00:15 - an element of a or X is an element of B
00:19 - also a intersection B is defined as the
00:21 - set containing elements X such that X is
00:24 - an element of a and X is an element of B
00:27 - so when I in introduce the inm poent law
00:31 - it should be clear that a union a equals
00:33 - a because a union a is defined as the
00:37 - set containing elements X such that X is
00:39 - an element of a or X is an element of a
00:44 - which should yield or you should see why
00:47 - that equals the set a also a
00:49 - intersection a equals the set containing
00:52 - elements X such that X is an element of
00:54 - a and X is an element of a which it
00:58 - should also be clear why that is the set
01:01 - a um next we have our identity laws so
01:05 - identity laws are U laws where we have a
01:09 - given set and we're performing an
01:11 - operation on that set with a given
01:13 - element uh these elements are the
01:15 - identity elements so for this case we
01:18 - have the null set and the universal set
01:20 - are our identity elements so a union
01:22 - null set equals a and by definition that
01:25 - means that a union null set equals the
01:28 - set containing elements X such that X is
01:31 - an element of a or X is an element of
01:34 - the null set but since we know that the
01:36 - null set is empty we can't possibly have
01:38 - any elements in there um so it's really
01:42 - saying that a union the null set is
01:45 - equal to the set containing elements X
01:47 - such that X is an element of a or more
01:51 - simply uh it equals a
