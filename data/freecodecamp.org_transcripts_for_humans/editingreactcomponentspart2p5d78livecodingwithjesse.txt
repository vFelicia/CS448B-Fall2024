00:07 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with jesse i'm jesse
00:10 - and today we're going to keep working on
00:12 - these react components
00:15 - so
00:16 - i've just been like grinding through
00:18 - stuff uh yesterday
00:21 - and today
00:23 - um
00:24 - i was uh
00:26 - i have a side project now that i'm
00:28 - working on um it's like a blockchain
00:31 - wallet
00:33 - uh so
00:35 - i was up last night late working on that
00:38 - too uh which we're doing that in react
00:40 - native
00:41 - so that's kind of cool
00:44 - um but i'm just trying to like balance
00:47 - uh
00:48 - being able to work and trying to stay in
00:50 - that flow state and
00:53 - like going too far and getting burnt out
00:56 - so right now
00:57 - definitely not burn out just a little
00:59 - bit tired
01:01 - probably after i do the stream i might
01:03 - get something you can do a workout and
01:05 - then i should be good to go
01:07 - and i'll go work on my side projects
01:10 - uh but maybe i'll let you know a little
01:13 - bit more about that project later on
01:16 - and um
01:17 - maybe i'll do some something on my own
01:19 - channel
01:20 - uh but for now we're gonna work with
01:25 - let's see i just noticed something
01:28 - yeah i just noticed an issue with the
01:31 - faculty
01:32 - uh list item component
01:35 - so
01:36 - that's what we'll start with i'll show
01:38 - you what the issue is
01:40 - uh first in the ui
01:42 - uh and then we'll go to the component
01:44 - and uh we'll fix that and
01:48 - we may actually create an entirely new
01:50 - component a new page today
01:53 - as well but let's fix this first
01:57 - so i think if i don't fix it now i'll
01:58 - probably forget about it
02:03 - all right let me get
02:05 - let me get my screen ready
02:21 - i'll get my screen ready and then also
02:23 - i'm gonna set my pomodoro timer
02:34 - uh
02:45 - okay i got everything the screen ready
02:47 - for you all
02:50 - so let me switch it over
02:52 - okay
02:54 - and
02:55 - i can't remember it wasn't this green
02:58 - which one was it
03:01 - let me check here
03:04 - okay i think it was
03:06 - psychology and social work
03:23 - let's see
03:24 - i think it was this page
03:27 - nope
03:28 - maybe
03:30 - so uh i've been working on
03:33 - all these faculty list pages and making
03:35 - sure that in the router
03:37 - uh we have them in properly and like
03:40 - halfway through the list of the faculty
03:42 - list pages
03:44 - it um
03:47 - the the url switched up so sometimes
03:50 - it's just like the program slash faculty
03:53 - so it'd be like english slash faculty
03:56 - but sometimes it changes so it's it
03:58 - would be department slash english
04:01 - faculty so for some programs it uses
04:04 - that and for some programs it uses the
04:07 - other one
04:09 - and
04:10 - there's no like
04:12 - it it's not like there's two urls and
04:14 - they both get the same place it has to
04:16 - be one or the other
04:19 - so i had to uh finish out
04:22 - the routing function to be able to
04:23 - handle things with three parameters
04:26 - which we never really finished that
04:27 - because we hadn't we didn't need it yet
04:30 - so i had to do that make some
04:32 - adjustments in the routing function so
04:34 - check out the last couple commits if
04:36 - you're interested in that
04:37 - but when i was doing that i noticed
04:40 - this
04:42 - so
04:43 - um
04:44 - her last name is o'brien
04:47 - right with a little
04:49 - um
04:51 - what is it uh apostrophe yeah
04:54 - i can't even think uh a little
04:56 - apostrophe right so
05:00 - and
05:00 - i know we fixed this issue before does
05:03 - anybody watching know how to fix this or
05:05 - remember how we did it before i feel
05:07 - like i'm in class but
05:09 - i just
05:10 - i just want to see
05:12 - if anybody else
05:14 - how how you all would fix this
05:22 - i'll give y'all a second and i'll answer
05:24 - a question while i'm while i'm waiting
05:26 - uh cooldeep asks uh can you give a rough
05:29 - idea for how you built your timer i want
05:31 - to make it to
05:32 - um actually i did not build that timer
05:35 - uh so um
05:37 - the timer that i'm using
05:39 - it was built by harshit
05:42 - who's in this channel quite a bit so if
05:45 - he
05:46 - if he's able to make it today
05:49 - um then
05:50 - we can we can ask him when he comes into
05:52 - the channel i think his break's over and
05:54 - he's back to school though so i'm not i
05:57 - don't think he'll be able to make it
05:58 - very often now
06:00 - uh but i mean this is early enough in
06:02 - the day that he he might not be sleeping
06:04 - yet so
06:06 - um cool deep ass how can i contact him
06:10 - um
06:12 - i think what the best way would be uh i
06:14 - guess he's on twitter
06:17 - um
06:20 - yeah send me a uh a direct message on
06:22 - twitter my links in the profile
06:25 - are in the description of the video
06:28 - the link to my twitter profile is in the
06:29 - description of this video send me a dm
06:32 - and then i'll connect you with harshit
06:35 - i don't want to like put out harshit's
06:37 - twitter info on the stream in case he
06:39 - doesn't want me to
06:41 - okay
06:42 - so
06:43 - the way we're going to fix this is
06:47 - we're going to use
06:50 - dangerously set inner html
06:52 - right
06:53 - um
06:55 - it's okay to do that because we have
06:57 - control of the content
06:59 - don't definitely do not want to do that
07:01 - if you're allowing users to enter in
07:03 - their own content and then have a
07:05 - display
07:06 - uh because bad things could happen
07:13 - let's see
07:14 - john also says um
07:16 - maybe you could find them with a regular
07:18 - expression wrap them in a span
07:23 - sorry
07:25 - yeah i should say it's not like there's
07:27 - one way to deal with this but we're just
07:29 - gonna do the way that uh we've usually
07:32 - dealt with this and we have the
07:35 - the option to do it this way like i said
07:37 - because we have control of our data
07:40 - this is not an option
07:42 - in all cases though
07:47 - all right
07:49 - so
07:50 - oh that's way too small let me make that
07:52 - bigger
07:58 - okay let me know if that's big enough
08:00 - if i need to go bigger
08:03 - and
08:04 - i don't need that sidebar to be that big
08:08 - and there's not even anything on this
08:09 - page so
08:11 - all right cool
08:12 - so here's our faculty
08:15 - list and uh so we're not actually going
08:17 - well just to show you on our faculty
08:19 - list page
08:21 - we're taking in that data that we're
08:23 - getting from
08:24 - wordpress one of the pieces of data that
08:27 - we're getting is the title and that's
08:29 - the that's the little bit that has that
08:32 - that name with the uh
08:34 - apostrophe in it
08:37 - so
08:38 - we're grabbing that data and we're
08:40 - passing it as a prop
08:42 - called profile name to our faculty list
08:45 - item component so now let's go into the
08:47 - faculty list item component and let's
08:50 - find where we're using that
08:52 - um profile name
08:55 - prop
08:57 - all right so we've done that our
08:59 - destructuring up here so we can just say
09:01 - profile name we don't have to use this
09:03 - props all the time which is convenient
09:06 - and
09:07 - let's find profile name
09:10 - there it is okay so you can see
09:13 - we're just putting profile name in here
09:16 - we're not setting dangerously setting
09:18 - the inner html
09:20 - so we're going to do that to do that i'm
09:22 - going to copy and paste
09:27 - where we're doing it here
09:30 - uh with with our title
09:34 - and it's kind of odd that i didn't think
09:36 - to do this before since we're already
09:38 - doing it in
09:40 - looks like
09:42 - oh just one other place
09:44 - um
09:45 - but what we can do here then is put in
09:53 - our profile name
09:55 - i don't think we'll need to add the zero
09:57 - i'm not sure why we have that in
09:59 - title i don't remember what happened
10:01 - there that
10:03 - uh that made us have to do that and then
10:05 - we can get rid of this closing tag
10:07 - and just add our slash in here
10:15 - let's save it and
10:17 - see if it works see what happens
10:25 - hey there we go
10:26 - so now it's switched up and we can see
10:29 - this is displayed properly
10:31 - along you know everything else was
10:33 - already looking good
10:35 - but now
10:37 - that's displayed properly so don't have
10:39 - to worry about something like that
10:41 - happening again
10:46 - so that's awesome that's uh one quick
10:48 - win right off the bat so i'm gonna
10:51 - commit that
10:52 - if you uh if you weren't with me
10:54 - yesterday uh i had i had vowed yesterday
10:57 - that i was gonna try to stick to my own
10:59 - advice of committing often
11:02 - so
11:03 - i'm going to try to keep it up let's do
11:06 - git status
11:08 - yep that's what changed and so we can do
11:10 - a git add
11:11 - let's run our yarn cm
11:17 - and
11:19 - we'll fix
11:22 - and
11:23 - um
11:24 - let's see
11:29 - faculty names with
11:39 - not displayed properly
11:43 - and i don't think i ever made an issue
11:44 - about that because i i just saw it
11:47 - not too long ago
11:49 - so
11:50 - that should be good we'll make sure it
11:52 - passes the test
11:54 - and then we can push it
11:58 - and uh lately i've been going through
12:02 - a lot of the uh open issues
12:05 - and just trying to uh close some of them
12:08 - because we were starting to get a lot of
12:10 - issues that were open
12:12 - so the next one i noticed that shouldn't
12:15 - be too difficult
12:17 - to do is uh creating a template page
12:21 - for jobs
12:23 - so this is issue 107.
12:26 - if you want to check out the get
12:28 - repo for this
12:29 - the links in the description
12:42 - okay
12:43 - um so let me just explain what i want to
12:46 - do here
12:47 - and uh if you want to follow along you
12:49 - can read it as well in the issue but
12:52 - uh so right now on the site we have job
12:55 - listings and they're split up into two
12:57 - categories faculty and staff
13:00 - uh so
13:04 - we're basically we're the routes for
13:06 - these pages are going to be slash hr
13:10 - slash faculty openings and slash hr
13:13 - staff openings so both routes are going
13:15 - to go to the same
13:17 - component to be rendered but then within
13:20 - that component
13:23 - we are going to
13:24 - grab the data
13:27 - um
13:29 - and filter it so
13:30 - we probably won't filter we'll probably
13:32 - do is use we're going to create a new
13:36 - graphql query
13:38 - and we're only going to grab the posts
13:42 - the job listing post for that particular
13:46 - um
13:48 - category
13:49 - we'll pull them in we'll list them all
13:53 - in a similar way that we we just saw
13:55 - with those faculty profiles
13:57 - and then we'll need to make
14:00 - um going to double check on the current
14:03 - site but i believe each one of them will
14:05 - have to have its own page as well
14:08 - so will be just like the faculty
14:10 - profiles where you'll be able to click
14:11 - to learn more
14:12 - and then it will open up its own page
14:15 - [Music]
14:17 - i'll have to see what the url should be
14:19 - for those as well but the first thing
14:21 - we need to do is
14:23 - create the new component and create
14:28 - um
14:29 - i can't talk today create a new
14:31 - component and create the graphql query
14:34 - that's it
14:40 - okay
14:41 - uh yep and it looks like everything
14:43 - passed
14:45 - wonderful
14:46 - this would be get push
14:48 - that is now
14:49 - available
14:52 - on github
14:54 - all right so let's check out our
15:00 - pages folder
15:02 - and let's see
15:03 - make sure i didn't already make
15:05 - something for this
15:12 - nope
15:13 - all right and since we already have the
15:15 - faculty list page up and uh it's gonna
15:17 - be similar to our jobs page let's just
15:20 - copy and paste our faculty list page
15:23 - and then uh we'll modify it and turn it
15:25 - into our jobs page
15:28 - so we're going to select everything copy
15:31 - it
15:31 - and uh let's make a new
15:36 - a new file
15:37 - called
15:41 - jobs
15:44 - dot
15:47 - um
15:48 - no it'll be
15:49 - let's make it job list
15:51 - i could make it plural jobs and then
15:53 - also have a template for job like just
15:56 - job but uh i think it's way more clear
16:00 - if you add the list at the end uh it's a
16:03 - lot easier to just
16:06 - mistake the two when there's only one
16:07 - character difference so we're going to
16:09 - say job list.js
16:17 - and then depending on how much time we
16:19 - have maybe we'll make
16:21 - the single job page
16:23 - as well
16:26 - okay so
16:27 - we need to
16:29 - change the name here
16:31 - so faculty list
16:34 - and faculty list
16:37 - faculty list
16:40 - um
16:42 - i was hoping i could just uh select all
16:44 - these but i can't right now so let's
16:46 - just call this
16:49 - jobless just a job list component
16:52 - and
16:56 - job
16:57 - list oops i don't need that list okay
17:01 - so we change the name
17:03 - and this is now job list
17:07 - we do have to remember to make a route
17:09 - for this in the router we'll never be
17:10 - able to get to it
17:22 - okay
17:25 - uh
17:26 - we're gonna name
17:28 - we're gonna rename our query as well
17:33 - so actually you may be able to grab all
17:34 - the query stuff at once
17:44 - job list query
17:46 - and we need to grab this from
17:51 - job list
17:54 - so
17:55 - on our other panel here
17:57 - let's work on our query
18:01 - and we can
18:02 - again we'll be able to copy that query
18:05 - that we're already using and just adjust
18:07 - it
18:08 - so in our queries
18:10 - we'll take that faculty list query
18:16 - we're going to copy that
18:18 - and
18:19 - make a new file we're going to call this
18:21 - job list
18:23 - dot js
18:27 - just paste it in there
18:30 - and
18:36 - job list was that
18:40 - i can't remember if that's capitalized
18:41 - or not yep it is faculty list
18:45 - so we'll capitalize that for job list
18:47 - and then
18:50 - let's change it here as well
18:52 - job list
18:54 - and instead of faculty departments
18:57 - i believe we can just
18:59 - say job
19:02 - i may have to double check to make sure
19:04 - um
19:05 - what i named that particular uh post
19:08 - type
19:19 - yeah let's see and then it's not going
19:21 - to be faculty
19:27 - yeah let me let me go back a second
19:30 - so i'm not looking at departments we're
19:31 - looking at
19:33 - yeah i need to check let's go to our
19:35 - wordpress uh installation and check what
19:38 - we name these because i created this
19:40 - post type
19:42 - a long time ago
19:50 - i believe i created the right taxonomy
19:52 - as well
19:53 - if i didn't then i need to make it
19:55 - because that's going to be important
19:57 - okay jobs
20:00 - oh
20:02 - it i don't think i have any taxonomy set
20:04 - setup
20:06 - so
20:08 - we may be doing some php for a minute
20:21 - nope there's nothing okay
20:24 - all right let's do that quickly
20:27 - uh hopefully
20:32 - hopefully i have this repo
20:34 - downloaded already
20:38 - um
20:39 - on my other screen i'm gonna get this
20:41 - opened up
21:03 - okay i think i do have it
21:12 - great pool
21:17 - okay
21:19 - all right so i'm gonna open this up
21:22 - and pull it over
21:26 - so we can check this out
21:32 - all right so here is our
21:37 - our plugin our franciscan custom post
21:39 - types.php file here
21:42 - uh so here's a wordpress plugin and
21:46 - we have jobs we may as well look up what
21:48 - we named jobs
21:51 - uh so it looks like
21:53 - it's just its job okay so that's that's
21:56 - pretty simple
21:58 - uh to remember but now we need to go
22:00 - down here to
22:03 - our taxonomies
22:05 - and let's check this out
22:17 - okay
22:19 - um
22:22 - yeah so we definitely need to add that
22:24 - taxonomy
22:27 - so let's grab
22:35 - let's grab this staff department's
22:38 - code
22:44 - we're going to copy and paste that
22:47 - to create a new
22:52 - [Music]
22:54 - jobs instead of staff department we'll
22:56 - call this uh we're gonna create a new
22:58 - taxonomy
22:59 - uh job
23:02 - job category
23:09 - you know what now i remember why i
23:10 - didn't make this before
23:12 - uh i was gonna use the advanced custom
23:14 - fields plug-in
23:16 - to just make a um
23:18 - like a radio a field with it's a radio
23:21 - um button that you can either pick
23:24 - staff or faculty
23:27 - instead of an entirely new taxonomy
23:34 - but
23:34 - at this point that's going to take
23:36 - longer
23:38 - so i'm just going to do it like this
23:43 - hi gemma hi
23:45 - do you want to say hi to people on
23:46 - youtube
23:55 - [Music]
24:02 - to the ice cream shop but mama said no
24:06 - all right well maybe a different time
24:08 - well she might she might like this
24:11 - okay because i really want to go because
24:13 - we haven't been here in a really long
24:14 - time
24:16 - okay you wanna do you wanna watch me
24:19 - code
24:20 - okay you gotta be quiet though because
24:22 - we're gonna try to do something now all
24:23 - right okay okay
24:27 - all right so let's take
24:29 - all these instances where it says staff
24:32 - department and let's change it to
24:35 - job
24:37 - category
24:39 - and we'll do the same thing here
24:54 - uh you know what
25:04 - yeah i guess it's okay
25:05 - it's a word
25:08 - you know i will need to to start using
25:10 - that advanced custom fields plug-in at
25:12 - some point so um
25:16 - we might maybe we'll do that on a stream
25:18 - let me know if you're interested in how
25:19 - we set that up and use it i do need to
25:21 - double check and make sure that it will
25:23 - work with graphql though
25:28 - jump
25:30 - um
25:42 - category
25:55 - all right so we're going to job
25:56 - categories and then down here
25:58 - we'll do the same thing oops
26:02 - well we'll camel case then
26:05 - uh for that wp graphql plug-in things
26:08 - need to be camel case
26:26 - all right
26:27 - um
26:29 - oh they're talking to you
26:31 - um
26:34 - uh this is my daughter her name's gemma
26:36 - and they say you're cute
26:38 - cute gemma
26:46 - that microphone is not hooked up to the
26:47 - computer
26:48 - okay
26:50 - he was checking it out okay
26:53 - all right
26:55 - actually we're gonna do
26:57 - i'm gonna save this
26:59 - and
27:00 - oops
27:02 - this needs to be a new
27:18 - okay i had a drink right there but
27:21 - luckily it was in a like a travel mug
27:23 - instead of just the glass
27:25 - it would have been all over the place
27:27 - okay so my timer is up so i'm going to
27:29 - stop here
27:31 - before we check out to see if it'll work
27:33 - so it'll be suspenseful while i answer
27:35 - questions for five minutes uh so we're
27:37 - gonna do a short break i'm gonna scroll
27:39 - all the way up to the top and try to
27:40 - answer as many questions as i can in uh
27:43 - in five minutes
27:45 - and then we'll go back to this what are
27:47 - the questions
27:49 - well let me let me see the question okay
27:55 - um
27:57 - i see a lot of you just saying saying hi
28:00 - so hey everyone uh
28:02 - dash dash moo
28:04 - says um sorry if i mispronounced that
28:06 - let me know how i should pronounce it
28:08 - but anyway they say tell us more about
28:10 - that blockchain wallet side project
28:12 - um
28:13 - okay yeah i'll briefly talk about that
28:16 - it's um
28:18 - so there is a
28:20 - website called uh git coin
28:24 - so it's um
28:26 - g i t c o i n uh i can't remember if
28:31 - it's
28:32 - maybe it's dot io i'm not sure
28:34 - but anyway the idea behind it is that
28:37 - you take
28:39 - open github issues
28:42 - for uh projects and then you set a
28:44 - bounty on them and it's a certain amount
28:47 - of cryptocurrency so if you complete
28:51 - if you solve that issue
28:53 - then you get that that bounty right in
28:56 - cryptocurrency so um i get emails
28:59 - occasionally from that website that'll
29:02 - just update me on some things i might be
29:05 - interested in working on and i saw one
29:07 - and um it was using react
29:10 - and it had a decent bounty on it so i
29:12 - thought hey i'll try this out but by the
29:14 - time i
29:15 - um submitted a request to work on it
29:17 - someone else had already requested it so
29:19 - they they got it first but then i got to
29:22 - talking to the person that maintains
29:24 - that repo and they were saying that
29:26 - they're also working on you know a
29:28 - different project that's porting this
29:31 - web app to a react native uh app
29:35 - and um they asked if i had experience
29:37 - with react native and i said yeah and i
29:39 - sent him some of my repos and so now
29:42 - i'm working on that
29:45 - so
29:47 - at this point i'm just kind of working
29:49 - on ui stuff so i have some sketch files
29:51 - about how it's supposed to look
29:52 - and i'm trying to get that all sorted
29:55 - um
29:57 - you know as soon as i can
29:59 - i think it's a really really useful web
30:01 - app and i really want to use the the app
30:04 - itself lastly i can put in my info and
30:08 - saw it and it's
30:09 - it's really cool
30:11 - it gives you all your
30:14 - basically you give it your metamask
30:16 - wallet address and it it lists out all
30:19 - your coins and then the value of your
30:22 - coins and you know whatever currency you
30:24 - select
30:31 - um
30:33 - priyanka says can you please tell me how
30:35 - to get a job if someone is new to coding
30:38 - um if you're new to coding um the best
30:41 - thing to do is like keep learning keep
30:43 - working on projects
30:45 - um and
30:48 - you may
30:50 - i mean it depends a lot on where you're
30:52 - at
30:53 - and and what your skill level is but
30:57 - if you find
30:58 - if there's like an agency or something
31:01 - where you work or you know a company
31:02 - that's doing websites
31:05 - or whatever you want to work on
31:07 - uh you could ask them submit your
31:08 - resumes even if you're not hiring and
31:10 - just say like hey i'll work as a
31:12 - contract worker hourly basis or
31:14 - something
31:15 - that could open up the door for you to
31:18 - work on projects that you wouldn't
31:19 - normally be able to get on your own and
31:22 - clients that you would never be able to
31:23 - have access to on your own since you
31:25 - you're just trying to build up your
31:26 - reputation
31:27 - so that's one way to do it another way
31:30 - is just to reach out to clients on your
31:31 - own
31:32 - um
31:33 - you know
31:34 - small businesses in your area that might
31:36 - need
31:37 - you know work done
31:38 - you can try websites that list work
31:41 - um
31:42 - if you want
31:44 - i i've never had great luck with those
31:47 - there's a lot of competition you usually
31:48 - don't get paid that much
31:50 - uh but if you don't have any other way
31:52 - to build your portfolio that's a way to
31:54 - do it i've even heard of people picking
31:56 - a business that has let's say like a
31:58 - terrible website and redoing their
32:00 - website for free and then going to the
32:02 - business and showing them what they've
32:04 - done and saying that would you be
32:05 - interested in
32:06 - you know in having this website
32:09 - uh so
32:11 - you know those are just a few ways i'm
32:13 - sure there's a lot more that i'm
32:15 - forgetting but
32:17 - you know basically your focus at this
32:19 - point should be just building up your
32:21 - portfolio preferably with with projects
32:24 - for real clients
32:26 - but in the meantime if you don't have
32:28 - paying work try your best to keep
32:31 - learning keep doing projects that at
32:33 - least you can put in your github profile
32:36 - and in your portfolio
32:45 - um dash
32:46 - mook says
32:48 - uh how does react.js work for search
32:51 - engine optimization
32:53 - um we are using server side rendering
32:56 - for this
32:57 - and you need to do that if you want to
33:00 - use react and you want to use data that
33:02 - you're pulling in from an api
33:06 - you need to render it on the server side
33:08 - for search engines to see it
33:12 - you can do that a variety of ways the
33:15 - easiest way that i've found is just to
33:16 - use
33:17 - uh next js because it comes
33:20 - automatically with server side rendering
33:22 - so that's what we we're using right now
33:28 - okay and my timer is up so i'm gonna
33:30 - have to come back and finish answering
33:32 - the questions uh after the next pomodoro
33:34 - session so let's see uh if we can get
33:37 - this component up and running hey gemma
33:40 - i can't see my screen okay
33:43 - are you looking at that one now yeah i'm
33:45 - gonna look at that one now we're gonna
33:47 - go back and do some more code
33:49 - okay
33:50 - uh let's see
33:53 - okay here's what else i'd like to do i
33:55 - think it might not be a bad idea to add
33:57 - some more categories to the jobs uh this
34:00 - could um
34:02 - it could help users sort better right so
34:05 - let's add
34:06 - uh
34:08 - in addition to adding this to
34:10 - uh staff the staff members
34:13 - uh we're gonna add it to jobs oop job
34:18 - and
34:21 - what is this staff
34:23 - department and there should be a faculty
34:29 - should be a faculty department as well
34:40 - there we go
34:41 - so faculty department you can see is
34:43 - already used on a variety of post types
34:46 - and
34:49 - we're gonna add in
34:52 - job to this as well
34:55 - all right so now i'm just gonna copy and
34:57 - paste this into wordpress there are
34:59 - better ways to get your code into
35:00 - wordpress but this would be the fastest
35:02 - way right now since i don't have other
35:04 - ways set up
35:06 - and uh jimmy try not to uh wiggle the
35:09 - chair i'm i'm gonna get motion sick and
35:11 - so is everybody watching
35:16 - okay okay so we're gonna go down here to
35:18 - plugins
35:20 - into our editor
35:28 - and
35:29 - let's
35:30 - we're going to go to that franciscan
35:32 - franciscan custom post type plugin
35:36 - and now we can just copy and paste that
35:42 - oops i accidentally hit save like it was
35:45 - in my editor it's not
35:47 - we're gonna update that and we should be
35:49 - able to see the changes immediately
35:55 - if we did it right maybe i didn't do it
35:57 - right let me give it a refresh
36:01 - and now let's see
36:03 - oh yeah jobs yep here we go so now
36:08 - we have faculty department staff
36:09 - department oh and the category is called
36:11 - job we don't really want that i messed
36:13 - that up
36:14 - um
36:16 - let's change that really quick
36:20 - because that's going to be confusing
36:24 - so job
36:28 - yeah we need to say job category up here
36:35 - i know how to spell job
36:38 - it's easy
36:46 - [Music]
36:48 - okay
36:53 - all right so save that
36:55 - copy it and
36:58 - we still have this up on the screen
37:00 - which is good we'll update that
37:03 - and that should work now
37:06 - we'll give it a refresh
37:12 - and
37:14 - there we go now it says job category so
37:16 - [Music]
37:18 - that's wonderful so now if we go into
37:20 - jobs we should have there we go we have
37:24 - all these options
37:26 - uh and if we were to go into this
37:29 - this job clinical nursing instructor we
37:31 - can see that we can select these things
37:33 - here
37:34 - and we can add a new job category so we
37:38 - could say
37:40 - faculty
37:42 - as one category
37:46 - and staff
37:48 - as the other
37:50 - so now faculty and staff are there all
37:53 - right now clinical nursing instructor
37:55 - would be a faculty position so we're
37:58 - going to uncheck staff
38:00 - okay and then we can say
38:03 - it within our faculty department we can
38:06 - check nursing department
38:08 - update that
38:15 - and now if we go back to check all our
38:17 - jobs
38:20 - so now we can see
38:22 - our department
38:24 - and our
38:30 - category oh no did i mess up category
38:34 - ah i misspelled category no
38:37 - all right
38:38 - well i think i spelled it right in the
38:40 - slug
38:41 - so um that's good because it won't mess
38:44 - up too much uh c-a-t yeah i spelled it
38:48 - right in the slug so that that's really
38:49 - what matters more like for the database
38:52 - uh data
38:55 - so let's change it here i definitely
38:57 - really like
38:59 - am just writing the first letter oh okay
39:03 - are you coding in your notebook
39:05 - it's actually mom
39:09 - so gemma's over here
39:11 - writing the code that we're writing
39:13 - she's writing it in a notebook
39:17 - she's coding along with us
39:26 - okay
39:27 - third time's a charm here right let's uh
39:30 - paste this in
39:31 - and
39:34 - now we'll have the uh the right spelling
39:37 - thanks for uh for letting me know about
39:39 - that
39:54 - uh glass down too hard it broke
39:58 - it was like one of those wine glasses
40:00 - that go up
40:03 - in the middle
40:04 - yeah yeah that's too bad
40:09 - and not baby shouldn't use those glasses
40:11 - huh
40:15 - okay
40:17 - well i used to use one but then but then
40:19 - it broke
40:20 - could you like either like pushed it off
40:24 - or something yeah there we go all right
40:27 - so that works now
40:29 - and
40:31 - now we can
40:33 - commit this change and push it up to
40:35 - github
40:38 - so let's see uh get add
40:42 - and
40:43 - connect
40:45 - and
40:46 - uh we're gonna say
40:49 - a new feature i'm gonna say add
40:52 - job
40:54 - category
41:00 - taxonomy
41:03 - and
41:04 - apply
41:09 - taxonomies to job post type
41:25 - all right great and so now um this this
41:28 - plugin is tracked on
41:30 - on github so you can check that out
41:34 - if you if you want to
41:37 - and now
41:44 - now we'll be able
41:45 - to do this so
41:48 - um
41:51 - be able to do what here's what we'll
41:53 - need
41:56 - what we need
41:58 - to make
42:00 - headphones all right so let me think how
42:03 - we're going to do this
42:04 - uh i guess the big
42:09 - yeah the first thing that we want to
42:12 - uh filter by i guess is
42:17 - actually let's let's think about this
42:22 - so right now let's go to the site right
42:25 - now i'm trying to think of a uh if we
42:27 - could create a better user experience
42:29 - than what we have right now
42:33 - all right so let's go through the steps
42:36 - that a user would take if they wanted to
42:38 - find a job listing
42:40 - to work at franciscan university i'm
42:42 - gonna do it like this so it's like kind
42:44 - of like
42:46 - if we're gonna do this now anyway you
42:48 - know we may as well give this some
42:50 - thought we don't have to copy the actual
42:52 - user experience you know as it currently
42:55 - is
42:57 - [Music]
43:03 - okay so we've come to the site and
43:08 - uh probably about
43:11 - about an employment and human resources
43:14 - okay
43:18 - so now that i'm here
43:22 - i either click see open faculty
43:24 - positions or see open staff positions
43:27 - let's open both of them
43:30 - because i believe these pages are
43:33 - pretty much the same
43:44 - let's see yeah so faculty openings these
43:48 - are all the same links
43:56 - okay this is pretty much it
43:59 - yeah i mean this is pretty much the same
44:01 - the only difference that i could see
44:04 - i mean there's a different image in the
44:06 - background so no big deal because we're
44:08 - not bringing images over right now
44:09 - anyway so here's my my idea what if
44:13 - in the router
44:15 - we made it so that both of those routes
44:18 - would go to
44:20 - the same page
44:24 - and
44:24 - [Music]
44:28 - from there then you could
44:30 - have filters
44:33 - like we did with the search page
44:36 - like we've done with with other
44:39 - projects
44:41 - and one of the filters would be do you
44:43 - want faculty openings or staff openings
44:50 - i i really think that's better because i
44:52 - mean to be honest with you it's entirely
44:55 - possible that someone might just want to
44:56 - work here and they may be looking for
44:59 - any opening
45:00 - faculty or staff
45:02 - perhaps they they do have a higher
45:04 - degree and they're qualified to do a
45:06 - variety of things
45:08 - they come in here
45:10 - you know if they've clicked on one let's
45:12 - say they didn't do like we did and open
45:14 - up new windows for both which probably
45:16 - would be the best way to go about this
45:18 - how it's currently set up but let's say
45:20 - they didn't
45:21 - and then they'd have to go to a
45:22 - different page
45:24 - to look at the different openings right
45:26 - there's actually
45:28 - not like no way
45:30 - to sort these at all
45:32 - so you could see like
45:35 - there's not that many jobs right now
45:39 - but it still would be nice to sort them
45:42 - occasionally we do have a lot of
45:43 - openings
45:45 - um
45:46 - so you know if if we had
45:50 - what is that like 10 openings somewhere
45:51 - around there no just guessing um
45:55 - 10 openings plus another couple openings
45:57 - and faculty like that's that is enough
46:00 - openings that
46:01 - you know maybe you might want to sort it
46:03 - right um
46:06 - in my mind i'm just thinking like
46:08 - when i've gone
46:10 - before to sites to try to find a job
46:14 - it is it's a little bit annoying to have
46:16 - to scroll through a lot of
46:18 - things that i'm
46:19 - i'm not even interested in or qualified
46:21 - for to try to find you know the one
46:23 - thing especially if i've heard from
46:25 - someone like hey they're hiring you know
46:27 - somebody here and i go to check it out
46:28 - and i gotta scroll through all this
46:29 - stuff
46:30 - it's a lot nicer if i could just search
46:33 - or click a category and go right to it
46:35 - so if we're trying to attract candidates
46:39 - uh i'd rather get as many applications
46:41 - as possible here
46:44 - and the best way to do that is to make
46:45 - it easier
46:47 - so
46:49 - anyway
46:52 - let me know what you think am i
46:53 - overthinking this
46:55 - or not
46:59 - either way uh
47:02 - i don't know we've already categor made
47:04 - the categories we've made the taxonomies
47:06 - in wordpress so you know we may as well
47:09 - utilize them
47:14 - at the very least there'll be one less
47:15 - link that we have to include in the menu
47:19 - so we'll just say
47:20 - um
47:21 - you know employment opportunities or
47:24 - something like that as the link
47:28 - and i think that would uh
47:32 - that would be better
47:36 - hey jim yeah don't mess with the chords
47:39 - you unplug all this stuff
47:41 - [Music]
47:49 - all right so let's do that then
47:52 - so what we'll do here then is uh we're
47:55 - going to grab
47:57 - this is going to be simplified now
47:59 - because we're not going to do any
48:00 - filtering within our query we're going
48:02 - to leave that all up to the component
48:05 - so at we're just gonna grab everything
48:12 - so let's go
48:13 - let's clean this up a bit
48:16 - and uh
48:18 - let's get rid of
48:23 - this part
48:25 - we won't need this anymore
48:28 - and
48:29 - let's see we do need to slug we need the
48:30 - name
48:34 - i don't know if we'll
48:38 - what do we have now
48:40 - you know what they have these images but
48:42 - i don't i don't think these
48:46 - it's just the same image over and over
48:47 - occasionally we throw in a different one
48:50 - so i'm not i don't think images are
48:52 - necessary right now
48:54 - uh
48:56 - let's see what the big page looks like i
48:58 - wonder where they're pulling this from
48:59 - if this
49:00 - is a separate thing
49:05 - okay
49:18 - okay for now i'm not going to show any
49:20 - of this stuff
49:25 - uh we'll just leave it with the title
49:29 - and then we'll see what we have we'll
49:30 - see if we want to add some more in
49:37 - so basically we just need the name in
49:39 - the slug
49:46 - and
49:50 - we don't want faculty departments and we
49:52 - don't need where
49:55 - right because we just need
50:01 - jobs
50:04 - and
50:06 - we don't need this part
50:14 - actually that's it
50:18 - let's test out
50:24 - our let's test out our query first so
50:28 - we're going to go in here and use
50:33 - our little tool here
50:38 - so our
50:39 - graph graphy ql i don't know how you're
50:41 - supposed to pronounce that but there's
50:42 - an i in there so i'm gonna say graph eql
50:45 - and um
50:46 - let's see
50:49 - if this query works
51:04 - oh there you go getting saved again
51:08 - nope all right what did we do wrong
51:11 - name okay so evidently name is not an
51:14 - option
51:20 - okay so we can get the jobs
51:27 - which is definitely cool
51:29 - uh so we get the jobs and
51:42 - we can't use name
51:44 - let's see what we can use
51:54 - yep we can use title
51:58 - great
52:00 - all right cool is that all the jobs that
52:02 - we have i thought we had more
52:04 - where's that at
52:15 - whoa
52:20 - yeah we definitely have a lot more
52:41 - hmm
52:53 - okay
53:03 - i wonder if we have uh some type of
53:12 - like limit
53:17 - is 10 the default
53:31 - i'm gonna have to check the
53:32 - documentation for um that wp graphql
53:35 - plug-in and see what
53:37 - what the defaults are for the number of
53:39 - posts it returns
53:51 - yeah
53:53 - okay but for now at least we can get
53:54 - some data back so
53:58 - we don't
54:01 - yeah we actually don't need all this
54:02 - right now
54:05 - we could
54:06 - take this down a little bit more
54:11 - here we go jobless
54:34 - okay
54:41 - slug
54:42 - let's
54:50 - faculty list item
54:52 - do we have
55:03 - i wonder if we could use the faculty
55:05 - list item
55:27 - yeah we're not doing any checks right
55:28 - now to make sure
55:30 - any of this content is coming in
55:52 - okay
56:04 - all right i'm thinking about
56:06 - making this a little bit more reusable
56:22 - uh you know what we do have some really
56:24 - specific things going on though
56:37 - all right i i hate making another
56:39 - component that's like
56:41 - so specific but
56:45 - actually you know what let's
56:48 - let's wait let's test it first so what
56:50 - we can do then is um
56:56 - instead of this
57:01 - let's just say
57:03 - what do we have
57:17 - okay this data so let's say um
57:23 - job
57:28 - let's call this
57:32 - job data
57:40 - jobs data and then in here we'll switch
57:44 - this up
57:49 - good job and we're actually going to get
57:51 - rid of most of this
57:55 - and
57:57 - we don't
57:59 - we don't need it to be like that see
58:01 - because our data is going to come back
58:02 - like this so it'll be data jobs edges
58:07 - and that's what we'll need
58:09 - so
58:10 - it'll just be
58:23 - data jobs
58:24 - edges
58:29 - okay
58:30 - so that's our jobs data
58:33 - that's what we're going to map over so
58:35 - each one is going to be a job
58:38 - we have our slug that'll work
58:40 - and then here
58:41 - we're going to do our
58:43 - let's see job node title we're just
58:45 - going to put this inside of an h1
58:50 - let's do an h2 because that'll be big
58:52 - so
58:53 - let's add job node title
59:03 - and up here we're not using this so
59:06 - let's get rid of this
59:11 - and let's save
59:13 - both of these
59:15 - see if this works hopefully i didn't
59:17 - mess this up too much that it's broken
59:19 - now
59:22 - but we can go to
59:29 - let's let's see if the routes there i
59:31 - doubt the route is there
59:33 - um
59:34 - about
59:36 - hr
59:37 - [Music]
59:45 - faculty opening
59:49 - nope so that route's not there let's add
59:51 - the route in our server
59:55 - um
60:00 - actually let's
60:12 - i wonder if we have an hr
60:15 - spot already anyway
60:28 - i think that was it
60:31 - hr
60:32 - okay so we have our hr page um
60:37 - let's
60:38 - change this up so this is the default
60:42 - it just defaults to page
60:44 - but then we also want
60:46 - when we get
60:49 - faculty openings
61:05 - we want it to render from our new jobs
61:16 - list
61:18 - so we called it
61:20 - no we called it job list
61:25 - okay so we wanted to render to that
61:29 - and then
61:35 - with our type whoops
61:38 - our type should be okay because we're
61:40 - not actually using the type at all
61:43 - um and then for our id
61:48 - we need an id
61:54 - i don't think we'll need an id
61:57 - not yet at least
61:59 - okay
62:00 - so save that
62:03 - see at least if we can get it to
62:07 - to render
62:15 - hmm
62:20 - oh there we go it was the server is
62:21 - restarting
62:55 - all right so that's not working what do
62:57 - we do
62:59 - let's see what our error is
63:02 - which
63:04 - y'all can't see that here we go
63:20 - oh a graphql syntax error okay
63:23 - all right so i messed that up
63:29 - let's see
63:37 - let's see what this query is
63:41 - nah
64:05 - just trying to find a similar query to
64:07 - what we need
64:29 - i don't write queries
64:31 - often enough
64:33 - um
64:35 - to be good at them
64:37 - it seems like i'm always
64:46 - all right unexpected name jobs
64:52 - this would it did work for us here right
64:54 - yeah
64:59 - wait and see what we get
65:13 - oh
65:14 - it worked great
65:18 - i just see nikki just said extra set of
65:20 - braces needed yep that was it
65:24 - nice
65:26 - all right cool so what we have when we
65:28 - go here to faculty openings is a list
65:33 - of openings
65:35 - awesome
65:41 - really cool
65:52 - awesome so that works so
65:56 - i believe my timer went off again or at
65:58 - least it's close to it
66:00 - yeah it timer went off again so
66:03 - basically from here
66:05 - what i will do
66:07 - is
66:08 - i'll put a little title up here so we
66:10 - know what page we're on
66:12 - uh and then i'll add in some
66:18 - i don't know where i'll put them maybe
66:19 - on this side
66:21 - uh basically i'll add in something
66:23 - some options so that users can filter
66:30 - i'll figure out how to have more than 10
66:32 - at once
66:37 - excuse me and then i'll add in routes
66:40 - so we're going to have a route for staff
66:42 - opening that'll go to the same place and
66:44 - then we'll just have a route for job
66:46 - openings
66:47 - and that's what we'll link to
66:50 - but just in case somebody had bookmarked
66:51 - this
66:52 - it'll still take them to the right place
66:55 - they just may need to click the button
66:57 - and then eventually
66:59 - you know as people get used to the new
67:01 - link
67:02 - you know we won't really get visits to
67:04 - the old links anymore
67:06 - um
67:08 - okay
67:12 - all right cool so i'll probably keep
67:15 - working on this a little bit so i can
67:17 - get it to a point where maybe um
67:21 - i can just make a commit
67:24 - i mean really at this point it does work
67:26 - so i got i mean i could commit this
67:28 - it's not like it's i'm committing it in
67:30 - a broken state
67:32 - um
67:33 - but i want to get back to your questions
67:35 - now and i'm gonna try to answer all your
67:37 - questions and uh then
67:40 - we're gonna wrap things up
68:18 - oh nikki said
68:20 - it still has no idea what a taxonomy is
68:23 - um
68:26 - let me
68:29 - all right so a taxonomy is just a
68:32 - category or a tag in um in wordpress
68:36 - so it's it's just a way to organize
68:39 - posts
68:49 - all right
68:50 - um
68:51 - dickie allen says i'm currently going
68:54 - through the free code camp curriculum
68:56 - uh and applied css still
68:59 - and i have gotten pretty far in a python
69:02 - udemy course i'm starting to understand
69:05 - object-oriented programming in python is
69:08 - there a good place to really find out
69:10 - what you should focus on like what
69:12 - skills give results in particular fields
69:15 - i'm not sure what i really want to do i
69:18 - like javascript though
69:20 - um
69:22 - i said like is there a site that covers
69:24 - specific languages and what you get out
69:26 - of them
69:27 - huh interesting
69:29 - uh i'm not
69:31 - i'm not sure that there's a site that
69:33 - does that
69:34 - just in general if you want to be in web
69:37 - development
69:39 - javascript's definitely the way to go
69:41 - you're not stuck with web development
69:43 - you can develop apps with react native
69:45 - and javascript there are ways to do
69:48 - machine learning with javascript there
69:50 - are even ways to do vr and ar stuff with
69:53 - javascript uh but
69:56 - in terms of like machine learning python
69:59 - seems to be the most popular
70:02 - if you wanted to do native apps
70:09 - i don't know how much java is still used
70:11 - but that's what you used to use
70:14 - and then with ios
70:21 - stuff you know maybe you might want to
70:22 - learn you know c-sharp and.net framework
70:25 - stuff
70:27 - so
70:28 - yeah so i don't know a site that lists
70:30 - all of that
70:32 - if anybody knows of anything like that
70:34 - it would actually be pretty useful
70:36 - uh so please let us know
70:43 - uh
70:44 - i hope hopefully says
70:47 - may you explain the registered taxonomy
70:49 - object the booleans and other values etc
70:51 - where are those i used to find all right
70:53 - let's check it out
70:56 - so register
70:59 - taxonomy so
71:01 - a lot of this is just extending what's
71:03 - already in wordpress core
71:05 - so
71:07 - you know we're not really like you know
71:09 - building up our own programming stuff
71:11 - here we are just telling wordpress
71:14 - you know hey um
71:16 - wordpress you already have this function
71:18 - called register taxonomy like here's
71:22 - here's all the arguments that that
71:24 - function takes to create a new taxonomy
71:28 - so you could see like
71:30 - i don't know if it's different
71:31 - terminology for python but like
71:34 - for javascript land like all right this
71:36 - is your function and all your arguments
71:39 - are within these
71:40 - um
71:43 - uh
71:45 - parentheses
71:47 - uh so first off you know we're saying
71:50 - the name
71:52 - uh
71:53 - job categories and then we have an array
71:55 - the second parameter here
71:58 - uh is
71:59 - okay what is this gonna apply to
72:01 - and so we give it an array of the slugs
72:05 - for each post type that we wanted to
72:07 - apply to and then the third parameter is
72:10 - an array of all these attributes
72:15 - that we would like it to have
72:17 - so
72:19 - you know all these attributes are
72:21 - options there even more than this but
72:23 - these are all options that we can set
72:27 - for our particular taxonomy that we
72:29 - wanted to have so
72:31 - you know for instance we want it to be
72:33 - available in the rest api we want it to
72:36 - be available through graphql
72:40 - so
72:42 - hopefully that explains a bit
72:44 - i don't know enough about wordpress core
72:47 - to like really go through more of it uh
72:50 - this top part here
72:52 - uh
72:52 - this is the labels array so like that
72:56 - gets inserted here
72:58 - so this one is just
73:00 - i mean you can see how it would be a
73:02 - mess to put it right in here so
73:03 - obviously like we we make this variable
73:05 - for that so the labels these all have to
73:08 - do with how
73:10 - you will display this in the ui uh the
73:13 - wordpress admin ui
73:16 - so these are just the names
73:18 - that we give to
73:20 - you know those different spots so that's
73:22 - why like
73:25 - um you know even though i had spelled
73:26 - category correctly down here and
73:28 - actually said job category when we
73:30 - looked in the ui it only spelled job and
73:32 - then when i tried to fix it it spelled
73:34 - job category but category was spelled
73:36 - wrong
73:37 - uh
73:38 - because you know this is just the
73:40 - display stuff
73:47 - all right let me know if if i didn't
73:49 - answer your question properly or if i if
73:51 - i misunderstood it
73:56 - um
73:57 - dickie also asked is there a good
74:00 - reference for what to charge clients
74:02 - uh if a figure would be good to charge
74:04 - less or to do stuff free at first but
74:06 - you don't want to kill the job market
74:09 - um yeah yeah uh so
74:13 - yeah in general like
74:15 - you
74:17 - you want to get experience right but you
74:19 - don't
74:21 - don't want to sell yourself short so
74:22 - yeah there when you first start out
74:24 - there are probably going to be times
74:26 - when you'll do work
74:27 - for less than you really want to do it
74:30 - but
74:31 - what what you're doing is
74:34 - you know basically
74:36 - you could consider yourself in a paid
74:38 - internship at that point because you're
74:40 - still learning
74:41 - and
74:43 - anything you get from a client
74:45 - is going to be better than just doing
74:47 - side projects on your own and not
74:49 - getting paid anything
74:51 - so you find a client that you you know
74:53 - maybe something that you think will be
74:54 - good for your portfolio
74:56 - and you know try to get what you can
75:00 - but at that point it's it's not
75:02 - necessarily about the money because
75:04 - you're trying to build yourself up to
75:06 - where you could actually make the money
75:09 - so
75:11 - if you need money
75:13 - you know right away
75:16 - you know then you may need to do some
75:17 - other jobs that are non-coding related
75:19 - to get the money i mean i i did
75:21 - uh when i was starting out um but you
75:24 - want to transition into hopefully like
75:27 - building so each new client you get
75:29 - you'll be able to charge a little bit
75:30 - more hopefully get into bigger projects
75:32 - you know more steady work
75:34 - uh but you you got to build somewhere so
75:36 - you got to start up building your
75:38 - portfolio so that you can justify your
75:41 - price to the client so that you can
75:43 - prove to the client that you're going to
75:44 - bring value to them based on your past
75:47 - projects so you can point to this and
75:49 - say you know i did this website for this
75:51 - small business it was similar to yours
75:53 - their profits increased by this much you
75:56 - know after
75:57 - my the website launched something like
75:59 - that right if you can should prove that
76:02 - then it'll be worth so much so even if
76:05 - you didn't get paid that much to do it
76:06 - the first time
76:07 - after that you can quantify your value
76:10 - the value of your work
76:13 - to clients um and then what you're going
76:16 - to get paid is not going to be based on
76:18 - you know
76:20 - what somebody thinks you're worth it's
76:22 - going to be based on the value that your
76:24 - work will bring to them
76:26 - as in
76:28 - you know if you do this project for them
76:30 - they will make an extra i don't know
76:33 - five thousand dollars a month
76:35 - right then your work is worth
76:39 - close to five thousand dollars a month
76:41 - right because they're going to come out
76:42 - on top from that investment
76:51 - hopefully that makes sense i mean
76:52 - there's a lot of different
76:54 - uh ways to approach pricing
76:57 - that's just kind of one of the ways
77:01 - but like i said when you're just
77:03 - starting out the idea should be
77:05 - figure out what you like to do
77:07 - and build up a good portfolio
77:10 - and and then it's going to be a heck of
77:12 - a lot easier to get those higher paying
77:15 - clients
77:20 - and make sure you're really professional
77:22 - like make a good name for yourself
77:25 - especially locally if word gets out that
77:27 - you're not reliable you'll have a much
77:29 - harder time getting work
77:31 - um
77:33 - you know it's if you're trying to get
77:35 - remote work from different places
77:37 - you know maybe it won't get out but you
77:39 - know with the internet like you don't
77:41 - want to ruin your reputation right away
77:43 - just because you think oh well this this
77:45 - guy's not you know this client's not
77:47 - paying me that much anyway
77:49 - um
77:50 - no he's you know be professional no
77:52 - matter what you're making
77:54 - uh because you never know what kind of
77:55 - referrals you could get or what kind of
77:57 - damage it could do if you get bad
77:59 - reviews
78:13 - uh chad says do you have videos for
78:15 - creating custom themes for wordpress um
78:18 - actually no i um
78:23 - i've never done a custom wordpress theme
78:26 - video
78:27 - so usually i don't make wordpress themes
78:30 - i just use their rest api or
78:33 - graphql with wordpress to pull out the
78:35 - data
78:36 - and
78:37 - i just
78:38 - sometimes i just delete the themes i
78:39 - don't use them at all
78:44 - but i mean some of these things like
78:45 - being able to make new post types and um
78:48 - taxonomies
78:50 - you know they could definitely
78:52 - uh help you if you're building a theme
78:58 - world says you should be vice president
79:00 - of dev
79:03 - you know what they should make that
79:04 - position and give it to me that would be
79:06 - awesome
79:12 - alpha says how cool is visual studio
79:14 - codes integrated terminal and debug
79:15 - console huh oh yeah for sure i love it
79:19 - i love it so convenient especially when
79:21 - i'm trying to stream it's all there
79:22 - right on one screen i don't have to flip
79:24 - around between screens
79:28 - hey harshit made it
79:30 - um harsha says i'm busy these days tons
79:32 - of schoolwork that's why i'm inactive
79:34 - yeah i figured i figured you had school
79:36 - i remember you telling me so yeah don't
79:38 - worry about it school comes first for
79:40 - sure
79:42 - um
79:43 - francis says
79:45 - asks uh cavs or warriors
79:49 - um
79:52 - i don't know i don't
79:55 - i don't really have a basketball team so
79:57 - like growing up there's no basketball
79:59 - team close to me
80:01 - uh
80:02 - i i usually side with like all
80:04 - pittsburgh teams because i grew up close
80:06 - to pittsburgh but they don't have a
80:07 - basketball team so it was never a big
80:10 - thing for me
80:11 - uh i guess if i had to pick i would say
80:14 - cavs because
80:16 - that
80:17 - they're like as close as i have to a
80:19 - hometown
80:20 - uh nba team
80:38 - all right stacy says hello hey uh hey
80:40 - stacy how's it going
80:50 - world says how do you avoid getting
80:51 - tired of coding i can only code like 30
80:53 - minutes a day
80:54 - hmm um
80:58 - i don't know i guess
81:01 - i mean two probably two things like one
81:03 - i do enjoy coding no there's three three
81:06 - three reasons why i can code for a long
81:08 - time one i enjoy coding number two
81:11 - i have
81:12 - years of experience of coding for long
81:15 - periods of time so i've built up my mind
81:19 - to be able to handle that right
81:21 - um
81:23 - because i i think it's like your body
81:25 - right you couldn't just go out and run
81:27 - for hours and hours if you haven't run
81:30 - that much before right
81:32 - it's the same way with coding like you
81:33 - couldn't just sit down and code for
81:34 - hours and hours your brain would
81:37 - be really tired right so
81:39 - and the third reason is uh money right i
81:42 - have to pay the bills so
81:44 - if i'm gonna get paid to code all day
81:46 - like i'm gonna code all day
81:48 - because
81:49 - if i don't like my family is not gonna
81:52 - have anywhere to live or they're not
81:54 - gonna have anything to eat uh my kids
81:56 - won't be able to
81:57 - um
81:59 - you know have any any toys or games or
82:02 - anything like that uh so
82:06 - that's also if all else fails the fact
82:10 - that i have to do it for my job
82:12 - will you know keep me coding
82:34 - okay nikki was saying that page also
82:36 - needs that dangerously set html does it
82:39 - you know bring it in
82:40 - it does yeah
82:43 - yeah i'll have to do that i mean it for
82:45 - for right now i just wanted to make sure
82:47 - that that query worked
82:49 - um but yeah you're right it when i start
82:52 - styling that for real it's it's going to
82:54 - be um
82:57 - uh
83:00 - dangerously dangerously set in her html
83:03 - to avoid this kind of stuff
83:09 - let's see
83:14 - okay is it
83:21 - all right so i guess at some point you
83:23 - couldn't hear me sorry about that it's
83:25 - possible maybe i covered up the mic i
83:30 - hopefully it's all right now
83:46 - um gabriel says how can i learn
83:48 - javascript uh there's a lot of different
83:51 - resources you can use to learn
83:52 - javascript i recommend checking out free
83:54 - code camp
83:56 - so freecodecamp.org
83:58 - will steer you in the right direction
84:01 - you can also it depends on how you like
84:03 - to learn
84:04 - uh if you like to read books to learn uh
84:07 - check out the book series called you
84:09 - don't know js
84:10 - and if you also um eloquent javascript
84:14 - is a good one
84:16 - and then if you like youtube videos uh
84:18 - the free code camp youtube channel has
84:20 - some good tutorial videos as well
84:30 - all right uh question is uh please could
84:33 - you clarify how to jump from html to sas
84:36 - in visual studio code
84:38 - uh csspeak only works with css
84:42 - um scss less
84:46 - in sublime plug-in go to css definition
84:49 - it allows me to jump to sas thanks in
84:50 - advance
84:52 - um i have no idea how to do that uh with
84:55 - with sas so i don't use that feature in
84:58 - visual studio code
84:59 - so if anybody else uses that please let
85:01 - us know in the in the chat
85:04 - but uh yeah unfortunately i can't help
85:06 - you with that because i've i don't use
85:07 - it
85:29 - uh
85:30 - yamamoto says house how's the health
85:32 - insurance in the developer world
85:34 - um
85:36 - i don't know my health insurance is
85:37 - pretty good and
85:39 - i would do work for university so it's a
85:41 - little different it's not like a tech
85:42 - company or anything
85:47 - most of the job
85:50 - descriptions for
85:52 - developer jobs here in the united states
85:54 - that i've seen do include health
85:55 - insurance
85:58 - so i'm not sure about
86:00 - you know what it's like in other
86:01 - countries but at least in the united
86:03 - states you know you should probably
86:05 - expect to get health insurance from a
86:07 - developer job
86:09 - and it
86:10 - it seems rare that insurance isn't
86:13 - offered
86:18 - uh matt dutcher says i think that the
86:20 - you don't know js has an entire series
86:22 - on github for free
86:24 - uh yeah yeah for sure it's it's for free
86:27 - so both of those books that i mentioned
86:28 - you can get online for free
86:35 - um hopefully says usually in a well-made
86:37 - site how much of it is custom-made and
86:39 - how much depends on frameworks and apis
86:42 - um it just depends
86:44 - it depends um and custom-made is not
86:47 - always better
86:48 - uh you know there's
86:50 - frameworks are
86:52 - are very helpful and uh they are been
86:55 - tested in a lot of situations so
86:58 - uh they can definitely be less buggy
87:00 - than something custom-made they have
87:01 - more kids here so let me
87:05 - let me switch it up
87:07 - there we go
87:08 - there's uh raphael and gemma
87:13 - you wanna say hi
87:22 - all right
87:23 - so yeah i mean i would um
87:26 - i mean it entirely depends like
87:28 - if you see a well-made site
87:31 - maybe it's custom maybe it's all
87:33 - frameworks uh
87:36 - it's just the quality of the site is not
87:38 - dependent on
87:40 - how much is custom and how much this
87:41 - frameworks and in my opinion
87:51 - john hanson says uh free code can't put
87:54 - up your how live coding changed my life
87:56 - youtube video on their channel oh cool
87:59 - cool uh i thought they might put that up
88:01 - i didn't know they did though that's
88:03 - awesome
88:18 - mad duchess says well cuties yeah and
88:21 - you have a happy father yeah
88:24 - yeah i love being a father
88:28 - um all right and i've gotten to the the
88:30 - end of the chat uh so
88:33 - thank you all so much for hanging out
88:35 - with me uh while i do my work and
88:38 - catching my mistakes
88:40 - uh which is super helpful
88:43 - and
88:44 - it's the end of the week so
88:46 - um i don't think i'll be doing any
88:48 - streaming over the weekend uh you never
88:50 - know if i do it maybe just might be
88:53 - something real low-key in my own channel
88:55 - which you can find a link to my channel
88:57 - in the description also i promise i
88:59 - wouldn't mention this very often i
89:00 - haven't talked about it all week
89:02 - for a week at least i did start a
89:05 - patreon page
89:07 - so
89:08 - uh you can find the link from my youtube
89:10 - channel
89:11 - uh in the description to some of my
89:14 - newer videos and things so
89:16 - uh if you're interested in maybe
89:19 - supporting me only if you have a little
89:21 - extra despair
89:23 - but if you do please check out my
89:24 - patreon channel and i'm i'm not going to
89:27 - spam you with requests i'll mention it
89:30 - occasionally
89:32 - but
89:33 - it would really help me out to be able
89:34 - to do things like
89:36 - get better equipment for streaming or
89:39 - potentially dedicate more of my time to
89:41 - creating content for you all
89:44 - so
89:46 - um yeah so any little bit helps i really
89:49 - appreciate it and if you have any
89:52 - um
89:54 - any suggestions for things that you'd
89:56 - like to see on my patreon like reward
89:59 - levels and things like that let me know
90:00 - because i'm definitely new at it and i'm
90:02 - not sure what you all want i'm just kind
90:04 - of guessing at this point so let me know
90:07 - um all right cool so
90:10 - i'll see you all
90:12 - again uh on monday and until then have a
90:15 - wonderful weekend

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to keep working on these react components so i've just been like grinding through stuff uh yesterday and today um i was uh i have a side project now that i'm working on um it's like a blockchain wallet uh so i was up last night late working on that too uh which we're doing that in react native so that's kind of cool um but i'm just trying to like balance uh being able to work and trying to stay in that flow state and like going too far and getting burnt out so right now definitely not burn out just a little bit tired probably after i do the stream i might get something you can do a workout and then i should be good to go and i'll go work on my side projects uh but maybe i'll let you know a little bit more about that project later on and um maybe i'll do some something on my own channel uh but for now we're gonna work with let's see i just noticed something yeah i just noticed an issue with the faculty uh list item component so that's what we'll start with i'll show you what the issue is uh first in the ui uh and then we'll go to the component and uh we'll fix that and we may actually create an entirely new component a new page today as well but let's fix this first so i think if i don't fix it now i'll probably forget about it all right let me get let me get my screen ready i'll get my screen ready and then also i'm gonna set my pomodoro timer uh okay i got everything the screen ready for you all so let me switch it over okay and i can't remember it wasn't this green which one was it let me check here okay i think it was psychology and social work let's see i think it was this page nope maybe so uh i've been working on all these faculty list pages and making sure that in the router uh we have them in properly and like halfway through the list of the faculty list pages it um the the url switched up so sometimes it's just like the program slash faculty so it'd be like english slash faculty but sometimes it changes so it's it would be department slash english faculty so for some programs it uses that and for some programs it uses the other one and there's no like it it's not like there's two urls and they both get the same place it has to be one or the other so i had to uh finish out the routing function to be able to handle things with three parameters which we never really finished that because we hadn't we didn't need it yet so i had to do that make some adjustments in the routing function so check out the last couple commits if you're interested in that but when i was doing that i noticed this so um her last name is o'brien right with a little um what is it uh apostrophe yeah i can't even think uh a little apostrophe right so and i know we fixed this issue before does anybody watching know how to fix this or remember how we did it before i feel like i'm in class but i just i just want to see if anybody else how how you all would fix this i'll give y'all a second and i'll answer a question while i'm while i'm waiting uh cooldeep asks uh can you give a rough idea for how you built your timer i want to make it to um actually i did not build that timer uh so um the timer that i'm using it was built by harshit who's in this channel quite a bit so if he if he's able to make it today um then we can we can ask him when he comes into the channel i think his break's over and he's back to school though so i'm not i don't think he'll be able to make it very often now uh but i mean this is early enough in the day that he he might not be sleeping yet so um cool deep ass how can i contact him um i think what the best way would be uh i guess he's on twitter um yeah send me a uh a direct message on twitter my links in the profile are in the description of the video the link to my twitter profile is in the description of this video send me a dm and then i'll connect you with harshit i don't want to like put out harshit's twitter info on the stream in case he doesn't want me to okay so the way we're going to fix this is we're going to use dangerously set inner html right um it's okay to do that because we have control of the content don't definitely do not want to do that if you're allowing users to enter in their own content and then have a display uh because bad things could happen let's see john also says um maybe you could find them with a regular expression wrap them in a span sorry yeah i should say it's not like there's one way to deal with this but we're just gonna do the way that uh we've usually dealt with this and we have the the option to do it this way like i said because we have control of our data this is not an option in all cases though all right so oh that's way too small let me make that bigger okay let me know if that's big enough if i need to go bigger and i don't need that sidebar to be that big and there's not even anything on this page so all right cool so here's our faculty list and uh so we're not actually going well just to show you on our faculty list page we're taking in that data that we're getting from wordpress one of the pieces of data that we're getting is the title and that's the that's the little bit that has that that name with the uh apostrophe in it so we're grabbing that data and we're passing it as a prop called profile name to our faculty list item component so now let's go into the faculty list item component and let's find where we're using that um profile name prop all right so we've done that our destructuring up here so we can just say profile name we don't have to use this props all the time which is convenient and let's find profile name there it is okay so you can see we're just putting profile name in here we're not setting dangerously setting the inner html so we're going to do that to do that i'm going to copy and paste where we're doing it here uh with with our title and it's kind of odd that i didn't think to do this before since we're already doing it in looks like oh just one other place um but what we can do here then is put in our profile name i don't think we'll need to add the zero i'm not sure why we have that in title i don't remember what happened there that uh that made us have to do that and then we can get rid of this closing tag and just add our slash in here let's save it and see if it works see what happens hey there we go so now it's switched up and we can see this is displayed properly along you know everything else was already looking good but now that's displayed properly so don't have to worry about something like that happening again so that's awesome that's uh one quick win right off the bat so i'm gonna commit that if you uh if you weren't with me yesterday uh i had i had vowed yesterday that i was gonna try to stick to my own advice of committing often so i'm going to try to keep it up let's do git status yep that's what changed and so we can do a git add let's run our yarn cm and we'll fix and um let's see faculty names with not displayed properly and i don't think i ever made an issue about that because i i just saw it not too long ago so that should be good we'll make sure it passes the test and then we can push it and uh lately i've been going through a lot of the uh open issues and just trying to uh close some of them because we were starting to get a lot of issues that were open so the next one i noticed that shouldn't be too difficult to do is uh creating a template page for jobs so this is issue 107. if you want to check out the get repo for this the links in the description okay um so let me just explain what i want to do here and uh if you want to follow along you can read it as well in the issue but uh so right now on the site we have job listings and they're split up into two categories faculty and staff uh so we're basically we're the routes for these pages are going to be slash hr slash faculty openings and slash hr staff openings so both routes are going to go to the same component to be rendered but then within that component we are going to grab the data um and filter it so we probably won't filter we'll probably do is use we're going to create a new graphql query and we're only going to grab the posts the job listing post for that particular um category we'll pull them in we'll list them all in a similar way that we we just saw with those faculty profiles and then we'll need to make um going to double check on the current site but i believe each one of them will have to have its own page as well so will be just like the faculty profiles where you'll be able to click to learn more and then it will open up its own page i'll have to see what the url should be for those as well but the first thing we need to do is create the new component and create um i can't talk today create a new component and create the graphql query that's it okay uh yep and it looks like everything passed wonderful this would be get push that is now available on github all right so let's check out our pages folder and let's see make sure i didn't already make something for this nope all right and since we already have the faculty list page up and uh it's gonna be similar to our jobs page let's just copy and paste our faculty list page and then uh we'll modify it and turn it into our jobs page so we're going to select everything copy it and uh let's make a new a new file called jobs dot um no it'll be let's make it job list i could make it plural jobs and then also have a template for job like just job but uh i think it's way more clear if you add the list at the end uh it's a lot easier to just mistake the two when there's only one character difference so we're going to say job list.js and then depending on how much time we have maybe we'll make the single job page as well okay so we need to change the name here so faculty list and faculty list faculty list um i was hoping i could just uh select all these but i can't right now so let's just call this jobless just a job list component and job list oops i don't need that list okay so we change the name and this is now job list we do have to remember to make a route for this in the router we'll never be able to get to it okay uh we're gonna name we're gonna rename our query as well so actually you may be able to grab all the query stuff at once job list query and we need to grab this from job list so on our other panel here let's work on our query and we can again we'll be able to copy that query that we're already using and just adjust it so in our queries we'll take that faculty list query we're going to copy that and make a new file we're going to call this job list dot js just paste it in there and job list was that i can't remember if that's capitalized or not yep it is faculty list so we'll capitalize that for job list and then let's change it here as well job list and instead of faculty departments i believe we can just say job i may have to double check to make sure um what i named that particular uh post type yeah let's see and then it's not going to be faculty yeah let me let me go back a second so i'm not looking at departments we're looking at yeah i need to check let's go to our wordpress uh installation and check what we name these because i created this post type a long time ago i believe i created the right taxonomy as well if i didn't then i need to make it because that's going to be important okay jobs oh it i don't think i have any taxonomy set setup so we may be doing some php for a minute nope there's nothing okay all right let's do that quickly uh hopefully hopefully i have this repo downloaded already um on my other screen i'm gonna get this opened up okay i think i do have it great pool okay all right so i'm gonna open this up and pull it over so we can check this out all right so here is our our plugin our franciscan custom post types.php file here uh so here's a wordpress plugin and we have jobs we may as well look up what we named jobs uh so it looks like it's just its job okay so that's that's pretty simple uh to remember but now we need to go down here to our taxonomies and let's check this out okay um yeah so we definitely need to add that taxonomy so let's grab let's grab this staff department's code we're going to copy and paste that to create a new jobs instead of staff department we'll call this uh we're gonna create a new taxonomy uh job job category you know what now i remember why i didn't make this before uh i was gonna use the advanced custom fields plugin to just make a um like a radio a field with it's a radio um button that you can either pick staff or faculty instead of an entirely new taxonomy but at this point that's going to take longer so i'm just going to do it like this hi gemma hi do you want to say hi to people on youtube to the ice cream shop but mama said no all right well maybe a different time well she might she might like this okay because i really want to go because we haven't been here in a really long time okay you wanna do you wanna watch me code okay you gotta be quiet though because we're gonna try to do something now all right okay okay all right so let's take all these instances where it says staff department and let's change it to job category and we'll do the same thing here uh you know what yeah i guess it's okay it's a word you know i will need to to start using that advanced custom fields plugin at some point so um we might maybe we'll do that on a stream let me know if you're interested in how we set that up and use it i do need to double check and make sure that it will work with graphql though jump um category all right so we're going to job categories and then down here we'll do the same thing oops well we'll camel case then uh for that wp graphql plugin things need to be camel case all right um oh they're talking to you um uh this is my daughter her name's gemma and they say you're cute cute gemma that microphone is not hooked up to the computer okay he was checking it out okay all right actually we're gonna do i'm gonna save this and oops this needs to be a new okay i had a drink right there but luckily it was in a like a travel mug instead of just the glass it would have been all over the place okay so my timer is up so i'm going to stop here before we check out to see if it'll work so it'll be suspenseful while i answer questions for five minutes uh so we're gonna do a short break i'm gonna scroll all the way up to the top and try to answer as many questions as i can in uh in five minutes and then we'll go back to this what are the questions well let me let me see the question okay um i see a lot of you just saying saying hi so hey everyone uh dash dash moo says um sorry if i mispronounced that let me know how i should pronounce it but anyway they say tell us more about that blockchain wallet side project um okay yeah i'll briefly talk about that it's um so there is a website called uh git coin so it's um g i t c o i n uh i can't remember if it's maybe it's dot io i'm not sure but anyway the idea behind it is that you take open github issues for uh projects and then you set a bounty on them and it's a certain amount of cryptocurrency so if you complete if you solve that issue then you get that that bounty right in cryptocurrency so um i get emails occasionally from that website that'll just update me on some things i might be interested in working on and i saw one and um it was using react and it had a decent bounty on it so i thought hey i'll try this out but by the time i um submitted a request to work on it someone else had already requested it so they they got it first but then i got to talking to the person that maintains that repo and they were saying that they're also working on you know a different project that's porting this web app to a react native uh app and um they asked if i had experience with react native and i said yeah and i sent him some of my repos and so now i'm working on that so at this point i'm just kind of working on ui stuff so i have some sketch files about how it's supposed to look and i'm trying to get that all sorted um you know as soon as i can i think it's a really really useful web app and i really want to use the the app itself lastly i can put in my info and saw it and it's it's really cool it gives you all your basically you give it your metamask wallet address and it it lists out all your coins and then the value of your coins and you know whatever currency you select um priyanka says can you please tell me how to get a job if someone is new to coding um if you're new to coding um the best thing to do is like keep learning keep working on projects um and you may i mean it depends a lot on where you're at and and what your skill level is but if you find if there's like an agency or something where you work or you know a company that's doing websites or whatever you want to work on uh you could ask them submit your resumes even if you're not hiring and just say like hey i'll work as a contract worker hourly basis or something that could open up the door for you to work on projects that you wouldn't normally be able to get on your own and clients that you would never be able to have access to on your own since you you're just trying to build up your reputation so that's one way to do it another way is just to reach out to clients on your own um you know small businesses in your area that might need you know work done you can try websites that list work um if you want i i've never had great luck with those there's a lot of competition you usually don't get paid that much uh but if you don't have any other way to build your portfolio that's a way to do it i've even heard of people picking a business that has let's say like a terrible website and redoing their website for free and then going to the business and showing them what they've done and saying that would you be interested in you know in having this website uh so you know those are just a few ways i'm sure there's a lot more that i'm forgetting but you know basically your focus at this point should be just building up your portfolio preferably with with projects for real clients but in the meantime if you don't have paying work try your best to keep learning keep doing projects that at least you can put in your github profile and in your portfolio um dash mook says uh how does react.js work for search engine optimization um we are using server side rendering for this and you need to do that if you want to use react and you want to use data that you're pulling in from an api you need to render it on the server side for search engines to see it you can do that a variety of ways the easiest way that i've found is just to use uh next js because it comes automatically with server side rendering so that's what we we're using right now okay and my timer is up so i'm gonna have to come back and finish answering the questions uh after the next pomodoro session so let's see uh if we can get this component up and running hey gemma i can't see my screen okay are you looking at that one now yeah i'm gonna look at that one now we're gonna go back and do some more code okay uh let's see okay here's what else i'd like to do i think it might not be a bad idea to add some more categories to the jobs uh this could um it could help users sort better right so let's add uh in addition to adding this to uh staff the staff members uh we're gonna add it to jobs oop job and what is this staff department and there should be a faculty should be a faculty department as well there we go so faculty department you can see is already used on a variety of post types and we're gonna add in job to this as well all right so now i'm just gonna copy and paste this into wordpress there are better ways to get your code into wordpress but this would be the fastest way right now since i don't have other ways set up and uh jimmy try not to uh wiggle the chair i'm i'm gonna get motion sick and so is everybody watching okay okay so we're gonna go down here to plugins into our editor and let's we're going to go to that franciscan franciscan custom post type plugin and now we can just copy and paste that oops i accidentally hit save like it was in my editor it's not we're gonna update that and we should be able to see the changes immediately if we did it right maybe i didn't do it right let me give it a refresh and now let's see oh yeah jobs yep here we go so now we have faculty department staff department oh and the category is called job we don't really want that i messed that up um let's change that really quick because that's going to be confusing so job yeah we need to say job category up here i know how to spell job it's easy okay all right so save that copy it and we still have this up on the screen which is good we'll update that and that should work now we'll give it a refresh and there we go now it says job category so that's wonderful so now if we go into jobs we should have there we go we have all these options uh and if we were to go into this this job clinical nursing instructor we can see that we can select these things here and we can add a new job category so we could say faculty as one category and staff as the other so now faculty and staff are there all right now clinical nursing instructor would be a faculty position so we're going to uncheck staff okay and then we can say it within our faculty department we can check nursing department update that and now if we go back to check all our jobs so now we can see our department and our category oh no did i mess up category ah i misspelled category no all right well i think i spelled it right in the slug so um that's good because it won't mess up too much uh cat yeah i spelled it right in the slug so that that's really what matters more like for the database uh data so let's change it here i definitely really like am just writing the first letter oh okay are you coding in your notebook it's actually mom so gemma's over here writing the code that we're writing she's writing it in a notebook she's coding along with us okay third time's a charm here right let's uh paste this in and now we'll have the uh the right spelling thanks for uh for letting me know about that uh glass down too hard it broke it was like one of those wine glasses that go up in the middle yeah yeah that's too bad and not baby shouldn't use those glasses huh okay well i used to use one but then but then it broke could you like either like pushed it off or something yeah there we go all right so that works now and now we can commit this change and push it up to github so let's see uh get add and connect and uh we're gonna say a new feature i'm gonna say add job category taxonomy and apply taxonomies to job post type all right great and so now um this this plugin is tracked on on github so you can check that out if you if you want to and now now we'll be able to do this so um be able to do what here's what we'll need what we need to make headphones all right so let me think how we're going to do this uh i guess the big yeah the first thing that we want to uh filter by i guess is actually let's let's think about this so right now let's go to the site right now i'm trying to think of a uh if we could create a better user experience than what we have right now all right so let's go through the steps that a user would take if they wanted to find a job listing to work at franciscan university i'm gonna do it like this so it's like kind of like if we're gonna do this now anyway you know we may as well give this some thought we don't have to copy the actual user experience you know as it currently is okay so we've come to the site and uh probably about about an employment and human resources okay so now that i'm here i either click see open faculty positions or see open staff positions let's open both of them because i believe these pages are pretty much the same let's see yeah so faculty openings these are all the same links okay this is pretty much it yeah i mean this is pretty much the same the only difference that i could see i mean there's a different image in the background so no big deal because we're not bringing images over right now anyway so here's my my idea what if in the router we made it so that both of those routes would go to the same page and from there then you could have filters like we did with the search page like we've done with with other projects and one of the filters would be do you want faculty openings or staff openings i i really think that's better because i mean to be honest with you it's entirely possible that someone might just want to work here and they may be looking for any opening faculty or staff perhaps they they do have a higher degree and they're qualified to do a variety of things they come in here you know if they've clicked on one let's say they didn't do like we did and open up new windows for both which probably would be the best way to go about this how it's currently set up but let's say they didn't and then they'd have to go to a different page to look at the different openings right there's actually not like no way to sort these at all so you could see like there's not that many jobs right now but it still would be nice to sort them occasionally we do have a lot of openings um so you know if if we had what is that like 10 openings somewhere around there no just guessing um 10 openings plus another couple openings and faculty like that's that is enough openings that you know maybe you might want to sort it right um in my mind i'm just thinking like when i've gone before to sites to try to find a job it is it's a little bit annoying to have to scroll through a lot of things that i'm i'm not even interested in or qualified for to try to find you know the one thing especially if i've heard from someone like hey they're hiring you know somebody here and i go to check it out and i gotta scroll through all this stuff it's a lot nicer if i could just search or click a category and go right to it so if we're trying to attract candidates uh i'd rather get as many applications as possible here and the best way to do that is to make it easier so anyway let me know what you think am i overthinking this or not either way uh i don't know we've already categor made the categories we've made the taxonomies in wordpress so you know we may as well utilize them at the very least there'll be one less link that we have to include in the menu so we'll just say um you know employment opportunities or something like that as the link and i think that would uh that would be better hey jim yeah don't mess with the chords you unplug all this stuff all right so let's do that then so what we'll do here then is uh we're going to grab this is going to be simplified now because we're not going to do any filtering within our query we're going to leave that all up to the component so at we're just gonna grab everything so let's go let's clean this up a bit and uh let's get rid of this part we won't need this anymore and let's see we do need to slug we need the name i don't know if we'll what do we have now you know what they have these images but i don't i don't think these it's just the same image over and over occasionally we throw in a different one so i'm not i don't think images are necessary right now uh let's see what the big page looks like i wonder where they're pulling this from if this is a separate thing okay okay for now i'm not going to show any of this stuff uh we'll just leave it with the title and then we'll see what we have we'll see if we want to add some more in so basically we just need the name in the slug and we don't want faculty departments and we don't need where right because we just need jobs and we don't need this part actually that's it let's test out our let's test out our query first so we're going to go in here and use our little tool here so our graph graphy ql i don't know how you're supposed to pronounce that but there's an i in there so i'm gonna say graph eql and um let's see if this query works oh there you go getting saved again nope all right what did we do wrong name okay so evidently name is not an option okay so we can get the jobs which is definitely cool uh so we get the jobs and we can't use name let's see what we can use yep we can use title great all right cool is that all the jobs that we have i thought we had more where's that at whoa yeah we definitely have a lot more hmm okay i wonder if we have uh some type of like limit is 10 the default i'm gonna have to check the documentation for um that wp graphql plugin and see what what the defaults are for the number of posts it returns yeah okay but for now at least we can get some data back so we don't yeah we actually don't need all this right now we could take this down a little bit more here we go jobless okay slug let's faculty list item do we have i wonder if we could use the faculty list item yeah we're not doing any checks right now to make sure any of this content is coming in okay all right i'm thinking about making this a little bit more reusable uh you know what we do have some really specific things going on though all right i i hate making another component that's like so specific but actually you know what let's let's wait let's test it first so what we can do then is um instead of this let's just say what do we have okay this data so let's say um job let's call this job data jobs data and then in here we'll switch this up good job and we're actually going to get rid of most of this and we don't we don't need it to be like that see because our data is going to come back like this so it'll be data jobs edges and that's what we'll need so it'll just be data jobs edges okay so that's our jobs data that's what we're going to map over so each one is going to be a job we have our slug that'll work and then here we're going to do our let's see job node title we're just going to put this inside of an h1 let's do an h2 because that'll be big so let's add job node title and up here we're not using this so let's get rid of this and let's save both of these see if this works hopefully i didn't mess this up too much that it's broken now but we can go to let's let's see if the routes there i doubt the route is there um about hr faculty opening nope so that route's not there let's add the route in our server um actually let's i wonder if we have an hr spot already anyway i think that was it hr okay so we have our hr page um let's change this up so this is the default it just defaults to page but then we also want when we get faculty openings we want it to render from our new jobs list so we called it no we called it job list okay so we wanted to render to that and then with our type whoops our type should be okay because we're not actually using the type at all um and then for our id we need an id i don't think we'll need an id not yet at least okay so save that see at least if we can get it to to render hmm oh there we go it was the server is restarting all right so that's not working what do we do let's see what our error is which y'all can't see that here we go oh a graphql syntax error okay all right so i messed that up let's see let's see what this query is nah just trying to find a similar query to what we need i don't write queries often enough um to be good at them it seems like i'm always all right unexpected name jobs this would it did work for us here right yeah wait and see what we get oh it worked great i just see nikki just said extra set of braces needed yep that was it nice all right cool so what we have when we go here to faculty openings is a list of openings awesome really cool awesome so that works so i believe my timer went off again or at least it's close to it yeah it timer went off again so basically from here what i will do is i'll put a little title up here so we know what page we're on uh and then i'll add in some i don't know where i'll put them maybe on this side uh basically i'll add in something some options so that users can filter i'll figure out how to have more than 10 at once excuse me and then i'll add in routes so we're going to have a route for staff opening that'll go to the same place and then we'll just have a route for job openings and that's what we'll link to but just in case somebody had bookmarked this it'll still take them to the right place they just may need to click the button and then eventually you know as people get used to the new link you know we won't really get visits to the old links anymore um okay all right cool so i'll probably keep working on this a little bit so i can get it to a point where maybe um i can just make a commit i mean really at this point it does work so i got i mean i could commit this it's not like it's i'm committing it in a broken state um but i want to get back to your questions now and i'm gonna try to answer all your questions and uh then we're gonna wrap things up oh nikki said it still has no idea what a taxonomy is um let me all right so a taxonomy is just a category or a tag in um in wordpress so it's it's just a way to organize posts all right um dickie allen says i'm currently going through the free code camp curriculum uh and applied css still and i have gotten pretty far in a python udemy course i'm starting to understand objectoriented programming in python is there a good place to really find out what you should focus on like what skills give results in particular fields i'm not sure what i really want to do i like javascript though um i said like is there a site that covers specific languages and what you get out of them huh interesting uh i'm not i'm not sure that there's a site that does that just in general if you want to be in web development javascript's definitely the way to go you're not stuck with web development you can develop apps with react native and javascript there are ways to do machine learning with javascript there are even ways to do vr and ar stuff with javascript uh but in terms of like machine learning python seems to be the most popular if you wanted to do native apps i don't know how much java is still used but that's what you used to use and then with ios stuff you know maybe you might want to learn you know csharp and.net framework stuff so yeah so i don't know a site that lists all of that if anybody knows of anything like that it would actually be pretty useful uh so please let us know uh i hope hopefully says may you explain the registered taxonomy object the booleans and other values etc where are those i used to find all right let's check it out so register taxonomy so a lot of this is just extending what's already in wordpress core so you know we're not really like you know building up our own programming stuff here we are just telling wordpress you know hey um wordpress you already have this function called register taxonomy like here's here's all the arguments that that function takes to create a new taxonomy so you could see like i don't know if it's different terminology for python but like for javascript land like all right this is your function and all your arguments are within these um uh parentheses uh so first off you know we're saying the name uh job categories and then we have an array the second parameter here uh is okay what is this gonna apply to and so we give it an array of the slugs for each post type that we wanted to apply to and then the third parameter is an array of all these attributes that we would like it to have so you know all these attributes are options there even more than this but these are all options that we can set for our particular taxonomy that we wanted to have so you know for instance we want it to be available in the rest api we want it to be available through graphql so hopefully that explains a bit i don't know enough about wordpress core to like really go through more of it uh this top part here uh this is the labels array so like that gets inserted here so this one is just i mean you can see how it would be a mess to put it right in here so obviously like we we make this variable for that so the labels these all have to do with how you will display this in the ui uh the wordpress admin ui so these are just the names that we give to you know those different spots so that's why like um you know even though i had spelled category correctly down here and actually said job category when we looked in the ui it only spelled job and then when i tried to fix it it spelled job category but category was spelled wrong uh because you know this is just the display stuff all right let me know if if i didn't answer your question properly or if i if i misunderstood it um dickie also asked is there a good reference for what to charge clients uh if a figure would be good to charge less or to do stuff free at first but you don't want to kill the job market um yeah yeah uh so yeah in general like you you want to get experience right but you don't don't want to sell yourself short so yeah there when you first start out there are probably going to be times when you'll do work for less than you really want to do it but what what you're doing is you know basically you could consider yourself in a paid internship at that point because you're still learning and anything you get from a client is going to be better than just doing side projects on your own and not getting paid anything so you find a client that you you know maybe something that you think will be good for your portfolio and you know try to get what you can but at that point it's it's not necessarily about the money because you're trying to build yourself up to where you could actually make the money so if you need money you know right away you know then you may need to do some other jobs that are noncoding related to get the money i mean i i did uh when i was starting out um but you want to transition into hopefully like building so each new client you get you'll be able to charge a little bit more hopefully get into bigger projects you know more steady work uh but you you got to build somewhere so you got to start up building your portfolio so that you can justify your price to the client so that you can prove to the client that you're going to bring value to them based on your past projects so you can point to this and say you know i did this website for this small business it was similar to yours their profits increased by this much you know after my the website launched something like that right if you can should prove that then it'll be worth so much so even if you didn't get paid that much to do it the first time after that you can quantify your value the value of your work to clients um and then what you're going to get paid is not going to be based on you know what somebody thinks you're worth it's going to be based on the value that your work will bring to them as in you know if you do this project for them they will make an extra i don't know five thousand dollars a month right then your work is worth close to five thousand dollars a month right because they're going to come out on top from that investment hopefully that makes sense i mean there's a lot of different uh ways to approach pricing that's just kind of one of the ways but like i said when you're just starting out the idea should be figure out what you like to do and build up a good portfolio and and then it's going to be a heck of a lot easier to get those higher paying clients and make sure you're really professional like make a good name for yourself especially locally if word gets out that you're not reliable you'll have a much harder time getting work um you know it's if you're trying to get remote work from different places you know maybe it won't get out but you know with the internet like you don't want to ruin your reputation right away just because you think oh well this this guy's not you know this client's not paying me that much anyway um no he's you know be professional no matter what you're making uh because you never know what kind of referrals you could get or what kind of damage it could do if you get bad reviews uh chad says do you have videos for creating custom themes for wordpress um actually no i um i've never done a custom wordpress theme video so usually i don't make wordpress themes i just use their rest api or graphql with wordpress to pull out the data and i just sometimes i just delete the themes i don't use them at all but i mean some of these things like being able to make new post types and um taxonomies you know they could definitely uh help you if you're building a theme world says you should be vice president of dev you know what they should make that position and give it to me that would be awesome alpha says how cool is visual studio codes integrated terminal and debug console huh oh yeah for sure i love it i love it so convenient especially when i'm trying to stream it's all there right on one screen i don't have to flip around between screens hey harshit made it um harsha says i'm busy these days tons of schoolwork that's why i'm inactive yeah i figured i figured you had school i remember you telling me so yeah don't worry about it school comes first for sure um francis says asks uh cavs or warriors um i don't know i don't i don't really have a basketball team so like growing up there's no basketball team close to me uh i i usually side with like all pittsburgh teams because i grew up close to pittsburgh but they don't have a basketball team so it was never a big thing for me uh i guess if i had to pick i would say cavs because that they're like as close as i have to a hometown uh nba team all right stacy says hello hey uh hey stacy how's it going world says how do you avoid getting tired of coding i can only code like 30 minutes a day hmm um i don't know i guess i mean two probably two things like one i do enjoy coding no there's three three three reasons why i can code for a long time one i enjoy coding number two i have years of experience of coding for long periods of time so i've built up my mind to be able to handle that right um because i i think it's like your body right you couldn't just go out and run for hours and hours if you haven't run that much before right it's the same way with coding like you couldn't just sit down and code for hours and hours your brain would be really tired right so and the third reason is uh money right i have to pay the bills so if i'm gonna get paid to code all day like i'm gonna code all day because if i don't like my family is not gonna have anywhere to live or they're not gonna have anything to eat uh my kids won't be able to um you know have any any toys or games or anything like that uh so that's also if all else fails the fact that i have to do it for my job will you know keep me coding okay nikki was saying that page also needs that dangerously set html does it you know bring it in it does yeah yeah i'll have to do that i mean it for for right now i just wanted to make sure that that query worked um but yeah you're right it when i start styling that for real it's it's going to be um uh dangerously dangerously set in her html to avoid this kind of stuff let's see okay is it all right so i guess at some point you couldn't hear me sorry about that it's possible maybe i covered up the mic i hopefully it's all right now um gabriel says how can i learn javascript uh there's a lot of different resources you can use to learn javascript i recommend checking out free code camp so freecodecamp.org will steer you in the right direction you can also it depends on how you like to learn uh if you like to read books to learn uh check out the book series called you don't know js and if you also um eloquent javascript is a good one and then if you like youtube videos uh the free code camp youtube channel has some good tutorial videos as well all right uh question is uh please could you clarify how to jump from html to sas in visual studio code uh csspeak only works with css um scss less in sublime plugin go to css definition it allows me to jump to sas thanks in advance um i have no idea how to do that uh with with sas so i don't use that feature in visual studio code so if anybody else uses that please let us know in the in the chat but uh yeah unfortunately i can't help you with that because i've i don't use it uh yamamoto says house how's the health insurance in the developer world um i don't know my health insurance is pretty good and i would do work for university so it's a little different it's not like a tech company or anything most of the job descriptions for developer jobs here in the united states that i've seen do include health insurance so i'm not sure about you know what it's like in other countries but at least in the united states you know you should probably expect to get health insurance from a developer job and it it seems rare that insurance isn't offered uh matt dutcher says i think that the you don't know js has an entire series on github for free uh yeah yeah for sure it's it's for free so both of those books that i mentioned you can get online for free um hopefully says usually in a wellmade site how much of it is custommade and how much depends on frameworks and apis um it just depends it depends um and custommade is not always better uh you know there's frameworks are are very helpful and uh they are been tested in a lot of situations so uh they can definitely be less buggy than something custommade they have more kids here so let me let me switch it up there we go there's uh raphael and gemma you wanna say hi all right so yeah i mean i would um i mean it entirely depends like if you see a wellmade site maybe it's custom maybe it's all frameworks uh it's just the quality of the site is not dependent on how much is custom and how much this frameworks and in my opinion john hanson says uh free code can't put up your how live coding changed my life youtube video on their channel oh cool cool uh i thought they might put that up i didn't know they did though that's awesome mad duchess says well cuties yeah and you have a happy father yeah yeah i love being a father um all right and i've gotten to the the end of the chat uh so thank you all so much for hanging out with me uh while i do my work and catching my mistakes uh which is super helpful and it's the end of the week so um i don't think i'll be doing any streaming over the weekend uh you never know if i do it maybe just might be something real lowkey in my own channel which you can find a link to my channel in the description also i promise i wouldn't mention this very often i haven't talked about it all week for a week at least i did start a patreon page so uh you can find the link from my youtube channel uh in the description to some of my newer videos and things so uh if you're interested in maybe supporting me only if you have a little extra despair but if you do please check out my patreon channel and i'm i'm not going to spam you with requests i'll mention it occasionally but it would really help me out to be able to do things like get better equipment for streaming or potentially dedicate more of my time to creating content for you all so um yeah so any little bit helps i really appreciate it and if you have any um any suggestions for things that you'd like to see on my patreon like reward levels and things like that let me know because i'm definitely new at it and i'm not sure what you all want i'm just kind of guessing at this point so let me know um all right cool so i'll see you all again uh on monday and until then have a wonderful weekend
