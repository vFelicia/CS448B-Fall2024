00:00 - hey everyone what's up welcome back to
00:02 - day five of css3 in 30 days today we're
00:05 - going to be building something super
00:07 - simple
00:08 - and super easy but it's really really
00:10 - meaningful and can really kind of take
00:12 - your websites or your applications to
00:15 - the next level when it comes to user
00:17 - experience now let me show you what i
00:18 - mean jump over here into my browser
00:20 - we're going to do something called
00:22 - useful broken images now whether it's a
00:24 - typo in the image tag source or the
00:26 - image tag itself was misplaced or
00:28 - removed on the server
00:31 - images break all the time on the web
00:33 - the problem is the browser's default way
00:35 - to display a broken image is typically
00:38 - pretty darn ugly you know where you have
00:40 - that little like screen shot it shows
00:42 - like a little image thumbnail with like
00:43 - a crack through the middle or a rip and
00:45 - it just it's a broken image icon and it
00:47 - doesn't look very good sometimes it's
00:49 - just
00:50 - the browser's default way of displaying
00:52 - that kind of looks bad you can fix that
00:55 - however and actually use it as an
00:57 - opportunity to enhance the user's
00:59 - experience on your web pages with css
01:02 - now that's your challenge this lesson so
01:04 - you kind of take you know
01:06 - when websites throw you lemons you
01:08 - create lemonade right so we're going to
01:10 - be creating useful broken images let me
01:11 - show you
01:12 - this is a standard broken image
01:14 - it cannot find this image on purpose i
01:16 - coded it improperly so it's finding an
01:18 - image that is not located on the server
01:20 - anywhere
01:21 - this is what it looks like looks
01:23 - terrible
01:24 - it makes you look bad but if you scroll
01:26 - down here check this out
01:29 - flying eagle not found with a nice
01:31 - little icon a camera with an x and then
01:33 - a nice dotted line around it it's just
01:35 - it looks nicer
01:37 - now the image isn't there so that sucks
01:39 - but it's pulling in information and
01:41 - notifying the user of what happened
01:44 - this is a much more fluid and positive
01:47 - user experience let's find out how to
01:49 - code that right now shall we over here
01:52 - in our code editor i have my number five
01:54 - useful broken images
01:56 - course files go ahead and download that
01:58 - it's in this module you can click to
01:59 - download it it'll give you a dropbox
02:01 - link something really simple so you can
02:03 - download the useful broken images and
02:05 - index is the markup it's very simple all
02:08 - it is is an image tag with no with uh no
02:11 - image there so
02:12 - there's no image on the server called
02:13 - broken image i did that on purpose and
02:15 - then an alt attribute that's important
02:17 - because we're going to be using that in
02:18 - css
02:20 - that's all it is sandbox is where we're
02:21 - going to be coding up our uh styles and
02:24 - final is the final result so let's go
02:26 - ahead and do that code our styles right
02:28 - here first thing we're going to be doing
02:30 - is selecting a class just called image
02:33 - now i could have just selected the image
02:34 - tag but i just wanted to do it this way
02:36 - and we're going to say position relative
02:39 - the display will be inline block the
02:41 - font size let's do something like 0.7
02:44 - rim
02:45 - text align
02:46 - center
02:48 - text transform
02:50 - uppercase and save
02:53 - now if we head over to our browser
02:54 - you're going to see here
02:55 - uh that it's changed the
02:58 - the default style of the broken image
03:00 - now i want to make that font size a
03:01 - little bit bigger so i'm actually just
03:02 - going to say one rim and that should
03:05 - make it the default size i like that
03:06 - okay and now what we're going to do this
03:08 - is easy we're almost done image the
03:11 - after sudo element
03:14 - we're going to say display inherit so
03:16 - we're going to inherit the inline block
03:18 - style we're going to position
03:20 - absolute
03:22 - top 0
03:23 - left 0
03:25 - we're going to do width 100 percent
03:27 - min width it's going to be a minimum of
03:30 - 200 pixels padding will be 10 20 10
03:34 - and 45 to account for the icon that
03:36 - we're going to put in the left side
03:38 - we're going to go border oh we need a
03:40 - semicolon up here that's why
03:42 - border
03:43 - dashed dash to one pixel triple eight
03:46 - and then we're gonna say background
03:49 - color
03:50 - is gonna be
03:52 - f zero f zero f zero
03:54 - and then the background
03:56 - image we're gonna pull that url called
03:59 - no image
04:00 - dot png right here in our useful broken
04:02 - images folder directory background size
04:05 - for that image is going to be 10
04:08 - background repeat no repeat background
04:11 - position
04:12 - we're going to put it at 15 pixels in
04:14 - the x 10 pixels on the y z index 1
04:18 - and the content this is going to be cool
04:19 - so i'm going to save that actually save
04:21 - so far and see what we have now you can
04:25 - see there's nothing there
04:26 - we did all these styles but nothing
04:27 - showed up
04:29 - that's because we didn't do the content
04:31 - property yet so you always have to do
04:32 - content on an after or before pseudo
04:34 - element
04:35 - back here in the code editor simple we
04:37 - could do something like content to empty
04:39 - string
04:40 - now if we head back you'll see that
04:42 - something is appearing but it's this
04:44 - obviously doesn't look very good so
04:45 - we're going to fix that by adding text
04:47 - within that element
04:49 - and we're going to we're going to adjust
04:51 - that so so here in content
04:53 - we're going to do the double string and
04:56 - then
04:57 - right after that we're going to say
04:58 - attribute so it's the attribute value
05:01 - for the content property
05:02 - and we're going to say alt so what's
05:04 - that doing it's looking for the html
05:06 - attribute alt
05:08 - the value of it so here the alt flying
05:11 - eagle
05:12 - so it's looking for that attribute alt
05:14 - so it's going to grab that value and put
05:16 - it as the content and then after that
05:18 - another string to close one double
05:20 - string to close that previous one
05:24 - and then
05:25 - not found and then close the string one
05:27 - more time so how does this work so we
05:29 - have an open
05:30 - uh double string
05:32 - which closes over here
05:34 - but we also have another set of strings
05:36 - in here that wrap around the attribute
05:39 - alt so it's just something that we kind
05:40 - of have to do
05:42 - it's like concatenating the text so
05:45 - attribute alt so the alt text
05:48 - not found save that
05:50 - go over here to our browser check it out
05:52 - flying eagle not found we got that icon
05:54 - from our useful broken images directory
05:57 - nice and now if we had a different image
05:59 - let's go to our index and i'm just going
06:00 - to add another image here and say broken
06:03 - image 2
06:04 - and change the alt text to like let's
06:07 - just say paddle board and then i'm going
06:09 - to put uh a break tag save that check it
06:12 - out in the browser so paddle board not
06:14 - found now they're stacking on top of
06:15 - each other the reason why that's
06:16 - happening is because these are the after
06:18 - pseudo elements the actual image itself
06:22 - so if i inspect this
06:24 - the image itself is is this large and
06:27 - then the after pseudo element is that
06:29 - size so the image they're actually
06:32 - stacking on top of each other perfectly
06:33 - but it's the after pseudo-element that's
06:35 - conflicting so we just give the image
06:36 - some space around it so here i'm just
06:39 - going to say margin images will have
06:41 - like a margin of 0
06:44 - 0 40 pixels and then that should solve
06:47 - the problem there we go so over here we
06:49 - got some space nice looks great so that
06:53 - is day five useful broken images that's
06:56 - all we had to do is really simple but
06:57 - very powerful because hey it's nice to
06:59 - have a nicer
07:01 - user experience and we can do that with
07:03 - our broken images you didn't maybe you
07:05 - didn't know that you could do that and
07:06 - it's a pretty cool trick that's useful
07:07 - in your web development in your your
07:09 - portfolio your website apps applications
07:12 - client sites so hopefully you enjoyed
07:14 - the useful broken images lesson hang
07:16 - tight for tomorrow we're going to do day
07:18 - six and we've got some more fun stuff to
07:20 - code up in css i'll catch you there bye
07:22 - now

can see there's nothing there we did all these styles but nothing showed up that's because we didn't do the content property yet so you always have to do content on an after or before pseudo element
