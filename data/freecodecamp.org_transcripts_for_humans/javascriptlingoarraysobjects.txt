00:00 - in this video we're going to talk about
00:02 - arrays and about objects quick
00:04 - disclaimer objects in javascript are not
00:07 - exactly the same thing as objects in
00:09 - some other languages object-oriented
00:11 - languages
00:12 - so if you're familiar with another
00:14 - language and you're thinking wait that's
00:16 - really not an object
00:17 - i know we're talking exclusively about
00:19 - objects in javascript in this video
00:22 - what makes an array an array are these
00:24 - square brackets here here we declared a
00:26 - variable array with square brackets
00:28 - that's what i want you to remember for a
00:29 - raise inside of an array you can put
00:31 - anything you can put a string you can
00:33 - put a boolean you can put a number you
00:35 - can even put another array and have a
00:37 - nested array you can do that as many
00:39 - times as you want that's totally okay
00:41 - as far as objects there's a little bit
00:43 - of different notation notice the curly
00:45 - brackets here
00:47 - in all of these strings here we have key
00:50 - values
00:51 - and
00:52 - the property values
00:54 - you might see this referred to as json
00:57 - json that stands for javascript object
00:59 - notation a lot of times if you'll be
01:01 - making an api call something you'll
01:03 - learn about later the information you
01:05 - get returned will be in this format and
01:07 - javascript object notation
01:11 - technically you can even have an array
01:14 - of objects
01:15 - what i want to remember from this video
01:17 - is arrays
01:18 - square brackets it's just a set of data
01:20 - and objects
01:22 - curly brackets more strings in objects
01:24 - you have keys and properties
