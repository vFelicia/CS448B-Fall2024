00:09 - hi my name is luke siciliano i'm a web
00:11 - developer and i'm also self-employed
00:13 - i've decided to do this video for free
00:15 - code camp on the topic of how you can
00:17 - make money as a freelance developer or
00:19 - as someone who has just started up their
00:20 - own independent development business
00:22 - i feel that this is an important topic
00:24 - to talk about because a lot of people
00:27 - learn to code and then strike out on
00:29 - their own and quickly realize that
00:31 - running a business is a whole lot
00:33 - different than learning the code or
00:35 - working at dev job somewhere so the goal
00:38 - of this video is really to provide some
00:41 - tips and some framework for those who
00:43 - have decided to strike out on their own
00:44 - to hopefully make the whole venture a a
00:47 - little bit more enjoyable and be and
00:49 - most importantly a little bit more if
00:50 - not a lot more profitable
00:52 - so in this video we're really going to
00:54 - talk about a few different things
00:57 - number one is we're going to lay out
00:59 - some basic rules for making money as an
01:01 - independent developer and you may think
01:04 - well making money is easy i do work for
01:06 - people and i make money well some
01:09 - developers make a lot more money than
01:10 - others and the things we're going to
01:12 - focus on in that segment will touch on
01:14 - why and how you can actually increase
01:16 - your profits and make more money as a
01:18 - developer the second thing we're going
01:20 - to talk about is planning your new
01:22 - business and what i mean by this is
01:25 - the fact that you don't want to just run
01:26 - out and you know hang up your sign and
01:28 - say woohoo i'm in business now you
01:30 - really need to have a plan in place that
01:32 - deals with things such as what type of
01:34 - customers are you going to serve what
01:36 - types of services are you going to offer
01:39 - and you know what kind of company are
01:40 - you going to form and so on so forth if
01:43 - you have all those things nailed it from
01:45 - the get-go then you wind up making a lot
01:47 - more money and having a lot less stress
01:48 - on the back end so that's the second
01:50 - thing we'll be talking about
01:52 - the third thing we'll be talking about
01:54 - is actually getting started and at that
01:56 - point you've made your plan you've
01:58 - decided who you're going to serve what
01:59 - services you're going to offer and all
02:01 - that good stuff but now you've actually
02:02 - got to form the business you've got to
02:04 - get your infrastructure in place and all
02:06 - those things and that's what we'll be
02:07 - dealing with in that part of the video
02:10 - and in the fourth segment of this video
02:12 - we'll talk about managing your business
02:14 - on a day-to-day basis from both an
02:16 - administrative standpoint as well as a
02:19 - development standpoint and you're gonna
02:21 - find that doing both are equally
02:23 - important and if you manage yourself on
02:25 - a day-to-day basis correctly you can
02:28 - really make a lot more money
02:30 - so before we dive into it let's talk
02:32 - about who this video is for
02:34 - if you're someone who has already
02:36 - decided i'm going to
02:38 - go the freelance route i'm going to
02:40 - start an independent development shop or
02:42 - you've already done that you know in
02:44 - other words you're already on your own
02:45 - somewhere then this video is for you if
02:48 - you are debating
02:50 - whether or not you want to be a
02:51 - freelance developer whether or not you
02:53 - want to start your own dev shop or just
02:55 - kind of debating whether you want to get
02:56 - a job for somebody
02:58 - and that's a topic i've already
02:59 - discussed in a prior video and we're
03:01 - going to link to that in the description
03:03 - below with a time stamp so i would
03:05 - suggest watching that portion of that
03:07 - video before deciding whether or not
03:10 - you know this video is appropriate for
03:12 - you so
03:14 - with all that said let's get to it and
03:16 - good luck
03:27 - okay so the first thing we're going to
03:28 - talk about is the three basic rules to
03:30 - making money as a freelance developer
03:33 - and you've gotta nail all three of these
03:34 - things otherwise you're really gonna
03:36 - find yourself feeling like you're always
03:37 - stuck in second gear if not first gear
03:40 - and you're gonna feel like you just
03:41 - can't get ahead in your business and you
03:42 - may very well quit right because what
03:45 - happens when you feel like you're not
03:46 - getting ahead you certainly don't want
03:47 - to continue with something so
03:49 - understanding the three rules to making
03:50 - money as a freelancer is key before we
03:52 - get into
03:53 - anything else so what are the three
03:55 - rules number one is understanding that
03:58 - the amount of money you're going to make
04:00 - is in direct proportion to the amount of
04:02 - value you provide to other people so in
04:04 - other words you other person provide
04:06 - value okay that's rule number one
04:09 - rule number two
04:11 - is understanding the need to focus on
04:14 - your highest paying activities which may
04:16 - sound like duh but you would be
04:18 - surprised at how many people struggle in
04:20 - that area and rule number three is the
04:23 - need to understand that you have a
04:25 - full-time job and put in the time as
04:27 - soon as you strike out on your own again
04:29 - may sound common sense but you would be
04:31 - surprised so let's go ahead and take a
04:33 - look at each of these three rules all
04:35 - right
04:36 - and again you have to do all three
04:39 - number one
04:40 - the amount of money you're going to make
04:42 - is in direct proportion to the amount of
04:44 - value you provide to other people
04:47 - what do i mean by this
04:48 - and first thing you got to do is put
04:50 - yourself in the shoes of a customer all
04:52 - right the customer doesn't care about
04:54 - your experience the customer doesn't
04:56 - care about you know what languages you
04:59 - know they don't care about how much time
05:00 - you're going to put into something
05:02 - all that matters to them is the amount
05:05 - of value their business receives from
05:07 - the product you provide to them right
05:10 - let's say for example you're building an
05:12 - app for
05:13 - let's say a little restaurant
05:15 - and uh you know the restaurant owner
05:17 - says hey i want an app where people can
05:19 - order food online i want an app where
05:22 - people can make reservations online uh
05:24 - see my menu things of this nature
05:26 - somebody comes along and offers to build
05:30 - this app in a content management system
05:32 - like
05:33 - wordpress or joomla or something like
05:36 - that and they tell the restaurant
05:37 - whether they'll do it for three thousand
05:39 - bucks
05:40 - you come along and you tell the
05:42 - restaurant owner that you'll build them
05:44 - something from scratch you'll write your
05:45 - own html you'll write your own css
05:47 - you'll write your own javascript
05:49 - and you're gonna charge them five
05:51 - thousand dollars
05:52 - well
05:53 - here if your five thousand dollar app is
05:55 - right here and someone else's three
05:57 - thousand dollar cms bait pace app is
06:00 - right here
06:01 - and you provide
06:02 - no more functionality and no more value
06:05 - to the client in other words you don't
06:06 - make the client's business any better
06:08 - with your app than this person does with
06:10 - their app
06:11 - then
06:12 - all that all you've done is propose
06:14 - something that's more expensive right
06:17 - if you're not providing additional value
06:19 - to your customer they're not gonna pay
06:21 - more money
06:22 - okay why would i pay five thousand for
06:24 - something i can get the exact same
06:25 - functionality for three thousand
06:28 - um
06:29 - so what you've got to understand is the
06:31 - more you improve the customers situation
06:34 - the more money that customer is going to
06:37 - be willing to pay you okay so in other
06:40 - words it's not about what you think is
06:41 - important it's about what the customer
06:43 - sees as value so instead of saying
06:47 - mine's better because i'm not using a
06:49 - cms and i'm writing it i'm writing all
06:51 - the code myself again that doesn't make
06:53 - the customer's situation any better
06:54 - right
06:55 - but i hear from developers all the time
06:57 - and i've had many conversations with
06:59 - freelance developers who really do think
07:01 - that simply by
07:03 - coding things from scratch instead of
07:05 - using you know different tools that
07:07 - they're somehow providing a better
07:09 - product like well these are people who
07:11 - don't understand it's about providing
07:12 - value to the customer so if you're going
07:14 - to write something from scratch for the
07:16 - customer what you need to do is explain
07:19 - how your app provides value that the
07:21 - other one doesn't so for example hey
07:24 - that person's building you an app in a
07:26 - content management system here are some
07:28 - of the limitations in the content
07:30 - management system it may limit you in
07:33 - terms of how you want to grow your
07:34 - business
07:35 - with the app i'm going to write for you
07:37 - however you won't have those limitations
07:40 - and then you explain to them about how
07:42 - your app provides additional value that
07:43 - the other one does in other words value
07:45 - meaning your app allows their business
07:47 - to grow more than the other app does
07:49 - okay so
07:50 - taking the approach of understanding
07:53 - that you've got to explain value to your
07:54 - customers
07:56 - is how you're going to make more money
07:58 - always put yourself in your customers
08:00 - perspective and ask yourself what is it
08:01 - the customer is looking for what does
08:03 - the customer see as valuable the more
08:06 - you provide that value to the customer
08:08 - the more the customer is going to be
08:09 - willing to pay you okay that's rule
08:11 - number one provide value to the customer
08:14 - rule number two
08:15 - is the fact that you need to focus on
08:17 - your highest paying activities
08:20 - way too often i mean way too often
08:23 - people get themselves in this trap of
08:25 - focusing on work that has the highest
08:28 - total price tag
08:30 - but doesn't necessarily pay the most per
08:32 - unit of input
08:34 - let's use a simple example let's say
08:36 - i'm going to write a dinky little app
08:37 - for somebody pretty simple um it's only
08:40 - gonna take me maybe five hours uh i'm
08:42 - gonna charge them twenty five hundred
08:44 - bucks for it let's say
08:46 - that's five hundred dollars an hour
08:47 - right
08:48 - now let's say but it's also only twenty
08:50 - five hundred dollars
08:52 - now let's say the opportunity to write
08:54 - another app comes along
08:56 - and on that app i'm going to charge
08:59 - 50 000
09:01 - but i have to put in a lot and i mean a
09:04 - lot more time for obvious reasons on
09:07 - that big app
09:09 - well the first app you know let's say i
09:11 - made
09:12 - 2505 hours
09:14 - okay it's 500 an hour
09:16 - second app let's say when i sat sit down
09:18 - and look at it later i realized i only
09:20 - made 350 an hour on it
09:22 - a lot of people will get in the trap of
09:24 - saying
09:25 - well you know i made more money over
09:27 - here because i made 25 000 as opposed to
09:29 - 2500
09:31 - but what they're not recognizing is
09:34 - that you only have so much time in the
09:35 - day you only have so many resources to
09:37 - go around and you need to put those
09:39 - resources into the higher value
09:41 - activities so
09:43 - one was just enough the higher dollar
09:45 - amount in that scenario was just a
09:46 - chance to work more basically so what
09:49 - you want to do is look at the kinds of
09:51 - services you're providing
09:53 - and let's say you're providing three
09:54 - different services four different
09:56 - services to customers
09:57 - whatever service you're providing pick
09:59 - the one that pays the most
10:01 - per hour of input per resource that you
10:04 - put into it and do more of that so
10:08 - using my scenario from a minute ago
10:10 - the 2500 app that you can get done in
10:12 - five hours go out and find as many
10:14 - customers as you can to churn those apps
10:16 - out forget that larger work just try to
10:18 - turn those other things out in mass
10:20 - because again you make more per unit of
10:22 - input
10:23 - on those
10:24 - think of it in these terms
10:26 - if you have a choice of going to a job
10:28 - that pays you ten dollars an hour and
10:29 - you can work all the hours you want you
10:31 - have a choice of going to another job
10:33 - that pays you 15 an hour and you can
10:35 - work all the hours you want
10:36 - i would hope you would go to the 15 an
10:38 - hour job all the time and never show up
10:40 - at the 10 hour job again right
10:42 - i mean that's only common sense so
10:45 - you've got to take this same approach
10:46 - into your freelance business whatever's
10:48 - paying you the most focus on that and do
10:51 - as much of that as you humanly can we're
10:53 - going to talk a little bit more about
10:55 - this in a little bit later section in
10:57 - this course but for right now understand
10:59 - that the second rule of making money is
11:02 - focusing on the
11:04 - activities that pay you the most per
11:06 - unit of input your highest value
11:08 - activities okay so rule number one
11:11 - provide value to the customer
11:13 - rule number two
11:14 - is focused on the activities that are of
11:16 - the highest value to your freelancing
11:18 - business
11:20 - rule number three
11:21 - is you've got to put in the time again
11:23 - that may sound simple but you would be
11:26 - really surprised
11:28 - once you decide to go out on your own
11:31 - you have a full-time job you need to
11:32 - work full-time at your business this may
11:34 - sound like a sound like a shock but you
11:36 - don't get paid for not going to work
11:38 - okay
11:40 - so
11:41 - let's say
11:43 - you've got two customers
11:44 - um you're just starting out
11:47 - and
11:48 - right now those two customers keep you
11:50 - busy for say 15 hours a week
11:53 - a lot of developers are going to do that
11:55 - 15 hours of coding work and you know
11:57 - customer service every week and then
11:59 - after that just kind of sit around
12:00 - twiddle their thumbs
12:02 - you know wait for more work to come in
12:04 - the door
12:05 - but again what they don't understand is
12:07 - like i said once you strike out on your
12:09 - own you have a full-time job so let's
12:12 - just say you call a full-time job 40
12:14 - hours a week
12:15 - well if your customers are only taking
12:17 - up 15 hours a week that means you have
12:19 - 25 more hours that you need to be out
12:20 - trying to hustle up more business so
12:23 - 15 hours working for customers 25 hours
12:25 - trying to hustle up more business equals
12:27 - your 40 hours and think how many more
12:29 - customers you'll have
12:30 - if you put in that time in other words
12:34 - there is something you can be doing on
12:36 - you know to fill up your hours and make
12:38 - it a full-time job treat your business
12:41 - like a full-time job you're not going to
12:42 - make any money unless you work at it and
12:45 - as silly as that may sound again you
12:48 - would be surprised i i've talked to
12:49 - small business owner after small
12:51 - business owner after small business
12:52 - owner who doesn't work 40 hours a week a
12:55 - lot of times they don't work 30 hours a
12:56 - week
12:57 - and they're wondering why they're not
12:58 - making any money well you don't make
13:00 - money for not working okay so rule
13:03 - number one
13:04 - focus on providing value to your
13:06 - customer understand that your customer
13:09 - only cares about the value they receive
13:11 - and focus on providing as much value to
13:13 - them as humanly possible
13:15 - rule number two is identify the
13:17 - activities in your business which pay
13:19 - you the most per unit of input your
13:21 - highest value activities to yourself and
13:23 - focus on those
13:24 - rule number three is put in the time
13:27 - if you follow those three things
13:29 - you really are going to be ahead of a
13:32 - very large percentage of other freelance
13:34 - developers out there and i mean a very
13:36 - large percentage of them you are ahead
13:38 - of the game
13:39 - from the get-go just by understanding
13:42 - those three things okay and because
13:44 - you're going to understand those three
13:45 - things that's why you're going to do
13:46 - well
13:47 - working for yourself
13:49 - so now that we've talked about the three
13:51 - basic rules of making money let's talk
13:53 - about the planning stage of your new
13:54 - business
14:06 - okay let's go ahead and talk about the
14:07 - planning stage of your new company and
14:10 - what i mean by the planning stage is the
14:13 - fact that these are uh tasks and plans
14:16 - you should have in place before you even
14:18 - start taking customers if you do already
14:20 - have customers which is common freelance
14:23 - businesses then before you go out and
14:25 - try to bring in a whole lot
14:27 - more business you should really be
14:28 - knocking out the things we're about to
14:30 - talk about
14:31 - the reason why i say it's common for
14:33 - people to already have customers before
14:34 - they've planned out their business is a
14:36 - lot of times people start freelancing as
14:38 - a result of getting a random phone call
14:40 - and someone asking to complete a project
14:43 - and then bam next thing you know you're
14:45 - a freelancer
14:46 - so wherever you're at in your business
14:48 - whether you've already got your first
14:49 - customer or two or whether you're
14:51 - decided to strike out on your own and
14:54 - have not done so yet the following tasks
14:57 - that we're about to talk about are
14:58 - things that you need to get planned and
15:00 - in order before you start trying to take
15:03 - customers at any kind of scale okay um
15:06 - so we're really going to talk about four
15:08 - total things
15:09 - excuse me
15:10 - when it comes to planning your business
15:13 - number one is funding your operations um
15:16 - you may be thinking well what funding
15:19 - we'll talk about that in a minute number
15:21 - two is deciding what niche you're going
15:24 - to serve in other words you're not just
15:26 - going to provide random services to as
15:28 - many people as possible you want to
15:29 - actually pick a niche that you're going
15:31 - to serve and stay within that lane
15:33 - number three is figuring out what
15:35 - services you're going to offer within
15:38 - that niche and number four
15:41 - is going ahead and getting your company
15:43 - formed once you've got all those things
15:45 - figured out so
15:47 - let's go ahead and look at each of these
15:49 - things in turn
15:59 - okay so the first thing we need to talk
16:01 - about is how you're going to find your
16:02 - new business
16:03 - and
16:04 - right now when you hear that you might
16:06 - be thinking
16:07 - what funding is involved as a freelancer
16:09 - all i need to write code is my laptop
16:11 - and i already have that
16:13 - you will quickly be surprised at how
16:14 - fast expenses do start to add up for
16:17 - even someone who's self-employed you're
16:19 - going to have different service costs
16:23 - those service costs can include paying
16:24 - an accountant at the end of the year
16:26 - they can include paying for liability
16:29 - insurance for your business
16:30 - they can include the cost of a payroll
16:33 - company because you're going to want to
16:34 - form what's called nest corp which we'll
16:36 - talk about a little later um also if
16:39 - you're going to uh
16:41 - rent server space you're going to that's
16:44 - the service you're going to pay for in
16:45 - other words expenses will add up a lot
16:48 - faster
16:49 - than you may think
16:51 - and the one thing i cannot stress enough
16:54 - is that you want to be profitable from
16:57 - day one in your business and
17:00 - profitable every essentially every month
17:03 - after day one
17:04 - and month one
17:06 - it's really common in the technology
17:09 - industry for people to think it's okay
17:11 - to lose money for the sake of growth
17:14 - that is not okay it is not okay i know
17:16 - there are some big companies that have
17:18 - operated that way but trust me that is
17:20 - the exception it is not the rule
17:22 - contrary to what you see in the media
17:25 - what i would strongly suggest is for
17:27 - that you read a book called profit first
17:29 - we're going to link to it in the
17:31 - description below it talks a lot about
17:33 - why it is not okay
17:35 - for you to ever be losing money so in
17:38 - other words you want to be profitable
17:39 - from day one
17:40 - and you want to
17:44 - never be unprofitable okay
17:46 - so
17:47 - since you need to be profitable from day
17:49 - one the first manner of business is
17:52 - figuring out how to fund your operations
17:55 - do not go into debt to start your
17:57 - business okay
17:58 - mark cuban is on record as saying that
18:01 - only idiots would uh take out a loan or
18:04 - worse yet use a credit card to start a
18:06 - business
18:07 - if you take out a loan trust me the bank
18:10 - doesn't care if you are making money or
18:12 - not you've got to make those payments if
18:14 - you borrow money from relatives
18:16 - if you want you know not paying your
18:18 - relatives back might be a good way to
18:20 - destroy your relationship with them and
18:22 - if you start using credit cards next
18:24 - thing you know you're paying extremely
18:25 - high interest rates so do not go into
18:28 - debt
18:29 - it's essentially digging yourself into a
18:31 - hole that can be
18:32 - very difficult to get out of
18:35 - if you're someone that's just starting
18:36 - out and you've already got your first
18:38 - customer
18:40 - then whatever they're paying you
18:42 - essentially needs to sit in your
18:44 - business bank account and not go into
18:45 - your pocket it needs to sit in your
18:47 - business bank account and serve as a
18:50 - source of funding for when you get your
18:52 - next client if
18:54 - you don't have your first client yet and
18:56 - you're striking out on your own then as
18:59 - we talked about in our last section you
19:00 - need to be working 40 hours a week at
19:02 - your new business but you also need to
19:04 - be making some other money on decide to
19:06 - support yourself so whether that's for
19:08 - some kind of side hustle whether it's
19:09 - driving for uber or whatever
19:12 - you need to be
19:14 - self-funding in this in other words your
19:16 - business needs to fund itself and if
19:18 - you're just starting out
19:20 - then you need to fund your new business
19:22 - from whatever your other form of
19:24 - employment or
19:25 - income is in other words
19:27 - be uh self-funding and profitable from
19:30 - day one do not take out debt do not take
19:33 - out loans this is something
19:35 - i cannot stress enough
19:37 - so
19:38 - best ways to
19:40 - fund your new business
19:42 - there are quite a few like i said if you
19:44 - have a full-time job and you've decided
19:47 - to go the freelance route
19:50 - then guess what you now have two
19:52 - full-time jobs stay at your current job
19:55 - while working full-time at your
19:57 - freelance gig until you're in a spot
19:59 - where you can quit the full-time job
20:01 - which if you're hustling up at the
20:03 - freelance gig and working full time at
20:05 - it you will be able to quit your
20:06 - full-time job pretty quickly okay
20:09 - so
20:10 - your current source of your current
20:11 - employment
20:13 - can be a form of funding uh if you've
20:16 - got your first client again what they
20:18 - pay you should just sit in the operating
20:19 - account there's funding for your
20:20 - business don't take it out and spend it
20:23 - leave it in there to fund the business
20:26 - if you don't have a job currently and
20:29 - you
20:30 - are striking out on your own as a
20:31 - freelancer and you don't have any
20:33 - clients then again what you need to be
20:35 - doing is driving for uber or finding
20:37 - other ways to make money and live off of
20:39 - that
20:40 - and live off of that and leave some in
20:42 - the um you know in your reserve so you
20:44 - can also fund your business going
20:46 - forward but fund your business with cash
20:48 - that you have in cash that you earn do
20:50 - not fund it with debt that is something
20:52 - i cannot stress enough
20:54 - one of the best ways
20:56 - to make sure your freelance business
20:58 - fails is to start taking on debt okay
21:01 - and just think of it like this it's
21:02 - pretty hard to go broke if you don't
21:04 - know anybody any money right
21:06 - when you think of people who go broke
21:08 - it's usually because of that
21:10 - avoid debt in your new business i can't
21:12 - stress this enough this is something i'm
21:14 - not going to go on and on about instead
21:16 - again read profit first it's linked to
21:18 - in the description below
21:20 - okay so since we've talked about the
21:23 - biggest rule of funding your business
21:25 - avoid debt and fund it from
21:27 - other sources let's go ahead and talk
21:28 - about picking a niche for your new
21:30 - business
21:41 - okay so let's talk about choosing a
21:42 - niche for your new freelance business
21:45 - and what do i mean by niche by niche i
21:47 - mean you need to select a
21:50 - relatively narrow group of customers
21:52 - you're going to serve
21:53 - and or a relatively narrow group of
21:56 - services you're going to provide you do
21:58 - not want to take the approach of saying
22:01 - i need work i will take whatever is
22:02 - available and whatever comes in my door
22:05 - picking a niche is this strategy for
22:07 - making more money taking whatever comes
22:09 - in the door is a strategy for making
22:11 - less money
22:12 - so let's look at two things number one
22:14 - let's figure out why it is you need a
22:16 - niche in the first place and number two
22:18 - let's go about how you pick that niche
22:19 - okay
22:20 - so number one why do you need a niche in
22:23 - the first place well as i just said a
22:25 - second ago it leads to you having a less
22:27 - scalable business let's use a really
22:29 - simple example suppose
22:31 - i own a restaurant and i come to you and
22:33 - i say hey i want you to build me an app
22:35 - that for my restaurant that does a b and
22:37 - c
22:38 - okay to get that app working you may
22:40 - have to incorporate some third-party
22:42 - applications into it which means you
22:44 - have to go out and research those
22:45 - third-party applications you have to
22:48 - figure out what you need to do to
22:49 - incorporate them in the app when you
22:50 - build it and so on so forth
22:53 - you also might not know anything about
22:54 - the restaurant industry and as a result
22:56 - of that you need to take the time to
22:58 - learn a lot about the industry in
22:59 - general so you can learn about my
23:01 - business and build me a quality app
23:03 - and you charge me
23:06 - five thousand dollars for my app
23:08 - now later when the second restaurant
23:10 - comes along and wants a similar app
23:13 - you're already familiar with those
23:14 - third-party applications you already
23:16 - know a little bit about the restaurant
23:17 - industry that is all learning that you
23:19 - do not have to do a second time in order
23:22 - to charge the same amount of money the
23:24 - second time when you're building that
23:25 - second application so in other words by
23:28 - staying within the niche under this
23:30 - example restaurants you make more money
23:33 - unless you make uh more money by
23:36 - providing the same service in less time
23:38 - right to the second customer that's what
23:40 - happens when you choose a niche you're
23:42 - not in a state where you're constantly
23:45 - learning new languages learning new
23:46 - applications learning new industries and
23:49 - so on so forth the value of experience
23:51 - allows you to scale up your business and
23:52 - make more money by charging the same
23:54 - rate for your services but getting
23:56 - things done in less time okay
23:58 - what happens when you don't pick a niche
24:00 - well then you're constantly learning new
24:02 - languages you're constantly dealing with
24:03 - different kinds of businesses
24:05 - you're less likely to be able to reuse
24:07 - old code bases that you've written and
24:09 - so on so forth so picking a niche allows
24:12 - you to build a scalable business i
24:14 - cannot stress that enough
24:16 - now
24:17 - it is really really easy
24:19 - when you're first starting out to say
24:21 - i'm gonna take whatever comes in the
24:23 - door
24:24 - right
24:24 - um because after all you're just
24:26 - starting out you need clients but let's
24:28 - look at what that leads to
24:30 - you take whatever comes in the door as i
24:32 - said a minute ago you have to maybe
24:33 - learn a new language you have to learn
24:35 - some new frameworks you have to learn
24:37 - new applications you have to learn about
24:40 - a new industry
24:41 - and as a result you make some money but
24:43 - you don't make
24:44 - as much as you could the second time
24:46 - around right
24:47 - and now when your second client comes in
24:49 - the door the problem is because you're
24:50 - just taking anything and not sticking in
24:52 - a niche
24:53 - your second client is in an industry or
24:55 - field that has nothing to do with the
24:56 - first one so again you gotta learn some
24:57 - new applications and learn some new
24:59 - frameworks so on so forth you're
25:01 - constantly in a state of
25:04 - working
25:05 - more hours for less money and as a
25:07 - result of that you never get ahead and
25:09 - because you never get ahead you find
25:11 - yourself saying i need work so i'm going
25:12 - to take whatever comes in the door and
25:14 - it just becomes a vicious cycle that you
25:15 - literally never get out of so
25:17 - while it may be tempting to say i'm
25:20 - going to come whatever or i'm going to
25:21 - take whatever comes in the door i should
25:23 - say
25:24 - because i need money right now you have
25:26 - to recognize that that is a trap and it
25:28 - becomes very difficult to get out of
25:30 - taking work simply because it's
25:32 - available when it's outside of a niche
25:34 - you want to serve is like stepping over
25:36 - a dollar to pick up a dime it is not a
25:38 - good idea to step over a dollar and pick
25:40 - up a dime so when you get those work
25:42 - opportunities early on
25:44 - that are outside of the niche you're
25:45 - trying to serve
25:47 - it's hard but it's important to say no
25:48 - and trust me i completely understand it
25:50 - is hard to say no to revenue it is hard
25:52 - to say no to a potential customer but if
25:54 - it's outside that niche you want to
25:55 - serve whether that niche is working with
25:58 - a particular class a customer or
26:00 - providing a particular type of service
26:02 - or a combination of both it's important
26:04 - to say no when something falls outside
26:06 - your niche i just cannot stress that
26:07 - enough picking a niche means a more
26:10 - scalable business
26:11 - so how do you go about picking that
26:13 - niche right um that's a that's an
26:15 - important question
26:17 - uh that's really a broad topic and which
26:20 - could probably be
26:22 - i would say the subject of a second
26:24 - extremely long video
26:26 - the general rules i'll give you for
26:28 - picking a niche are
26:30 - pick something that you either are
26:31 - either one of two things one interested
26:33 - in it or
26:35 - two uh passionate slash you get excited
26:38 - about it um
26:39 - you know or you're good at it i guess
26:41 - would be a third thing so why do i say
26:43 - to pick something that you are
26:45 - excited about passionate about something
26:48 - your excuse me something you're really
26:50 - good at or something you have a
26:51 - particular skill set at
26:53 - number one is the fact that those are
26:55 - going to be things that you're likely to
26:57 - stick out the grind through right
27:00 - think of it like this if you're trying
27:02 - to do something that you're not good at
27:03 - and you're not excited about start and
27:06 - you're in those hard days of starting a
27:08 - business where the chances you're going
27:10 - to stick with this thing that you're not
27:11 - any good at and not excited about when
27:13 - you're already facing the struggles of
27:15 - starting a business the chances of you
27:16 - sticking with that aren't very good
27:17 - right
27:18 - so by picking something that you're
27:19 - either good at or excited about the
27:22 - chances are you're going to stick it out
27:23 - you know through the grind a lot more
27:26 - number two is the fact that if you're
27:28 - picking something that you're already
27:29 - good at and passionate about you're
27:31 - gonna find that that gives you the
27:33 - ability to provide more value than your
27:34 - competitors in that area so you're going
27:37 - to have a competitive advantage in large
27:39 - part because you are willing to put in
27:40 - that time so willingness to stick it out
27:43 - competitive advantage are the two big
27:44 - reasons why when choosing a niche you
27:47 - need to pick something that you're good
27:48 - at something that you're passionate
27:49 - about
27:50 - something that just kind of gets you
27:51 - excited um so on so forth the things i
27:54 - mentioned
27:56 - one interesting question i would say i
27:58 - get a lot is
27:59 - well
28:00 - how do i pick a niche and then i say
28:03 - what i just said i say well what are you
28:05 - excited about what do you like to do
28:06 - what are you good at
28:08 - and people didn't look at me a little
28:10 - bit confused and just to be frank
28:13 - the question of what do you like to do
28:14 - shouldn't be a hard question i mean what
28:16 - is it you like to do right
28:18 - um
28:20 - you know find things you are interested
28:22 - in personally
28:23 - and then try to make those your business
28:25 - and then that's something you're going
28:26 - to be more likely to stick with
28:28 - over time don't over complicate the idea
28:30 - of finding something that interests you
28:33 - and then just kind of rolling with it i
28:34 - cannot stress that enough so number one
28:38 - pick a niche number two
28:40 - is when you're picking that niche find
28:42 - something you're interested in something
28:44 - you're excited about
28:45 - um you know so on something you enjoy so
28:48 - on and so forth okay so now that that's
28:51 - out of the way let's get on to the next
28:52 - part of our video
29:03 - okay now that you've decided what niche
29:05 - you're going to serve it's important to
29:06 - figure out what services you're going to
29:08 - offer to that niche and then how you're
29:09 - going to charge for those services so
29:12 - let's look at each of those and we're
29:14 - really going to break this part of the
29:15 - discussion down into three sections the
29:17 - first section is going to be what
29:19 - services to offer the second section is
29:21 - going to be how to charge for those
29:23 - services and then the third part is
29:26 - going to be the need to make sure you're
29:27 - adding recurring revenue okay
29:29 - so let's look at each of these in turn
29:31 - number one what services should you be
29:34 - offering your potential customers that
29:36 - are within the niche you've picked out
29:37 - for yourself
29:39 - well what services to offer really comes
29:42 - down to three things and the first of
29:44 - these three things is how much are you
29:47 - interested in the work
29:48 - the second of these three things is to
29:51 - what extent is it scalable the third of
29:53 - these three things is to what extent can
29:56 - you outsource some of the work those
29:58 - three things decide what services you
30:00 - should be offering your niche let's look
30:02 - at each of those
30:04 - the reason why your level of interest is
30:06 - important when you're deciding what
30:07 - services you're going to offer is simple
30:09 - if you're performing work that you find
30:11 - boring that you find dull that you don't
30:13 - care about whatsoever the chances of you
30:15 - wanting to stick with it long term and
30:17 - build a business are slim to none to
30:20 - if there was a way to say negative it
30:22 - would probably be negative
30:24 - think of it like this if you have a nine
30:25 - to five job you certainly don't want to
30:27 - go to something that's completely boring
30:28 - every day right well
30:30 - trying to do that in the grind of your
30:32 - own business is even harder so when
30:34 - deciding what services to offer it needs
30:36 - to be something that interests you
30:37 - number one
30:39 - even if something interests you though
30:41 - to have a viable business it needs to be
30:42 - something you can scale out in other
30:44 - words something you can do at scale and
30:47 - the scalability of your idea really has
30:50 - two components to it
30:52 - number one is the fact of is or is the
30:55 - question of is there enough of a
30:56 - customer base out there you may
30:59 - perform a task for somebody and really
31:01 - enjoy the work and then find out it's
31:02 - just something that doesn't come up that
31:04 - much if there's not enough of a market
31:06 - out there that's not something you're
31:07 - going to be able to do at scale
31:09 - but the other aspect of scalability is
31:12 - the extent to which you can
31:15 - do the work without having to completely
31:16 - do everything over each time so in other
31:19 - words if you want to build a particular
31:21 - type of app for somebody
31:23 - and you realize it's a code base you can
31:25 - reuse and build similar apps for a large
31:28 - number of other people that's scalable
31:31 - because you're reusing that code base
31:32 - for similar customers over and over and
31:35 - over again so in other words you make
31:37 - more money off the second customer then
31:39 - you make off the first customer you make
31:41 - more money off the 10th customer than
31:42 - you make off the second one because
31:44 - you're refining this process every time
31:46 - because you're charging the same amount
31:47 - of money for the app each time right
31:49 - so scalability which again is size of
31:52 - the market and your ability to not have
31:55 - to replicate or to not have to
31:58 - start work over every time
32:00 - those are really how you look at the
32:02 - scalability aspect of this okay
32:05 - and number three in there again when
32:07 - deciding what services to offer is to
32:09 - what extent can you outsource some of
32:11 - this work
32:13 - even if you work 24 7 365 there are only
32:16 - so many hours in the day which means you
32:18 - can only take on so many customers if
32:20 - you want to make money as a freelancer
32:23 - and eventually
32:25 - scale up into a larger business you're
32:27 - going to have to get some of the work
32:29 - off of your plate so you can continue
32:30 - focusing on high value activities
32:33 - so
32:34 - when you're putting together a service
32:36 - that you're going to offer you need to
32:37 - say how much of this work can be
32:39 - performed by
32:41 - people
32:42 - that maybe have like entry-level coding
32:44 - skills
32:45 - how much of it can you outsource for you
32:47 - know like a decent price to other
32:48 - developers and so on so forth if for
32:51 - some reason you look at your service
32:53 - offering and realize it just cannot be
32:54 - outsourced
32:56 - in any way or that there aren't even
32:58 - components of it that can be outsourced
33:00 - that's probably not a good service
33:01 - offering to get into
33:03 - if you have something you're interested
33:05 - in if you have something you can scale
33:08 - and you have something where at least a
33:09 - good chunk of the work can be outsourced
33:11 - at a later time now you have something
33:13 - that a you can make a lot of money off
33:15 - of and b eventually scale into a larger
33:18 - business and that's why you're going to
33:20 - do that three-part analysis in deciding
33:23 - what services to offer within your
33:24 - nation again not to sound too repetitive
33:26 - but that three-part analysis is
33:29 - your level of interest the extent to
33:31 - which you can scale it out
33:33 - and the extent to which you can
33:34 - outsource some of this work
33:37 - so that's how you decide what you're
33:39 - going to offer once you've decided what
33:40 - you're going to offer it's important to
33:42 - look at how you're going to charge for
33:43 - it and i cannot stress enough it's
33:46 - important to charge flat fees or charge
33:49 - a set price for products as opposed to
33:51 - charging say by the hour
33:54 - charging by the hour would be
33:57 - you know telling someone you'll build
33:58 - them an app and you'll charge them x
34:00 - number of dollars per hour and at the
34:02 - end of the day you know you give them a
34:03 - bill
34:05 - and again the problem with this is the
34:07 - fact that there are only so many hours
34:09 - in a day you're trading time for money
34:11 - which is always a losing proposition by
34:13 - charging flat fees
34:15 - you get to take advantage of the work
34:17 - you have already done so for example if
34:20 - you build an app
34:22 - that serves a particular type of
34:23 - business you charge the business three
34:25 - thousand dollars for that app
34:27 - and then
34:28 - later on a second similar business comes
34:30 - along and wants a similar app
34:32 - you've already done a good amount of the
34:34 - work okay so
34:36 - you can reuse a lot of that code base
34:38 - and then charge three thousand dollars
34:39 - for an app the second time
34:41 - and the customer the second customer
34:44 - should say is still getting full value
34:45 - even though you're charging them three
34:47 - thousand dollars because they're getting
34:49 - the value of your expertise you became
34:51 - an expert in this area the first time
34:53 - you built the app they're getting the
34:54 - fact that you would have already worked
34:56 - any bugs out of the app because you
34:59 - probably debugged it as part of dealing
35:01 - with the first customer and so on so
35:03 - forth so by charging flat fees you what
35:06 - you make more per unit of your own input
35:08 - and you actually give better value to
35:10 - the customer so it's good for both sides
35:12 - you make more profits the customer gets
35:15 - a better experience
35:17 - and then the last thing i'll say when it
35:18 - comes to
35:20 - choosing what to offer
35:21 - pricing that offer is third thing would
35:24 - be the need to add recurring revenue and
35:27 - this is revenue where you don't
35:29 - necessarily have to make a brand new
35:31 - sale every month in order to bring in
35:34 - some
35:35 - income into your business
35:37 - and one of our businesses for example
35:39 - we have virtual private servers and then
35:42 - we
35:42 - offer the clients the option to have us
35:45 - host their app on our servers which we
35:47 - do and then so we essentially resell
35:49 - server space and then the clients pay a
35:52 - flat fee for that every month so
35:54 - on top of the fact that we just have
35:56 - money coming in every month for new
35:58 - sales to new customers there's a certain
36:00 - aspect that we can just count on coming
36:02 - in every month
36:04 - you know again for that recurring
36:05 - reselling revenue having recurring
36:07 - revenue really helps to kind of take out
36:09 - some of the highs and lows of working
36:11 - for yourself otherwise you might have
36:13 - months where you make a whole lot and
36:14 - months where you make a little having
36:16 - that recurring revenue really gives you
36:18 - some flexibility to let you kind of go
36:20 - along
36:21 - with your business okay so we've just
36:23 - talked about what services to offer how
36:26 - much to charge and we've talked about
36:28 - the need for recurring revenue so
36:31 - with all of that said let's get on to
36:33 - the next part of our video
36:44 - okay now that we've talked about what
36:46 - services you're going to offer and how
36:48 - you're going to charge for those
36:49 - services we need to talk about actually
36:51 - forming your business and this is going
36:53 - to be the last part of our discussion in
36:55 - the planning stages of starting your own
36:57 - freelance enterprise okay
36:59 - so
37:00 - forming your business really takes on a
37:02 - couple of different things number one is
37:05 - choosing the type of business entity
37:07 - you're going to use for
37:08 - your company and number two is actually
37:12 - getting it formed uh
37:14 - here's the one thing i want to stress
37:15 - before i get into these is
37:18 - this video should not be considered
37:19 - legal advice
37:21 - i'm not holding myself out as someone
37:23 - licensed to give you advice in forming a
37:26 - company on legal consequences and things
37:28 - of that sort those are things that
37:30 - should really be discussed with an
37:32 - attorney
37:33 - i cannot stress that enough that there
37:36 - can be serious consequences to
37:38 - choosing the wrong wrong form i should
37:40 - say for your business so it's always
37:42 - good to
37:44 - discuss these kinds of matters with a
37:45 - business lawyer
37:47 - when it comes to
37:49 - picking a business entity it's not a
37:50 - matter of just running out and starting
37:53 - to service clients once you decide to
37:55 - become a freelancer
37:57 - in most places you're going to need some
37:59 - kind of a business license okay working
38:01 - without that business license can be a
38:03 - crime in some places and usually is
38:06 - but also you want to really start to
38:08 - think about forming a company and in
38:10 - other words instead of just going out
38:12 - and
38:13 - getting a business license and working
38:14 - as a sole proprietor
38:16 - there can be benefits to forming a
38:18 - company such as a corporation or an llc
38:20 - which is a limited liability company
38:22 - um forming an s corp or forming some
38:25 - other kind of corporate entity
38:27 - again the kind of it that excuse me the
38:29 - kind of entity you choose is going to
38:32 - depend on the overall goals of your
38:34 - business and that's why it's best to
38:36 - talk to a lawyer what we do in our
38:38 - company is we've chosen to operate as an
38:41 - llc a limited liability company
38:45 - the benefits of an llc are number one it
38:48 - is an actual separate entity in other
38:50 - words it's considered a separate legal
38:52 - entity from my partners and i so what
38:55 - the llc means is that when our customers
38:59 - sign a contract they don't sign it with
39:01 - us as individuals they sign it with the
39:03 - llc they don't pay us as individuals
39:05 - they pay the llc when
39:08 - business expenses come up they don't get
39:10 - paid by us personally they get paid by
39:13 - the llc the llc has its own bank account
39:15 - and things of that nature um if the if
39:19 - you know we need a contract for services
39:21 - like if we have to rent server space the
39:23 - llc signs the contract with somebody
39:26 - else not you know we don't sign that as
39:28 - individuals
39:30 - the many benefits of having an llc
39:33 - include protections from liability so
39:36 - like let's say for example we were to
39:38 - sign a long-term contract with a vendor
39:41 - let's say we signed uh signed up for
39:43 - server space and had to sign a one year
39:45 - commitment for that
39:47 - and let's say after six months
39:50 - for whatever reason our business fails
39:51 - and we don't want to be in business
39:53 - anymore and the server space vendor
39:55 - decides to
39:57 - try to take us to collections or to even
39:59 - sue us to collect the rest of the money
40:01 - they were owed they could only sue the
40:03 - llc they could not sue us as individuals
40:05 - generally speaking so in other words it
40:07 - protects your individual credit your
40:09 - individual assets and um things of that
40:13 - nature can also protect you
40:15 - under the right circumstances from
40:17 - liability from your clients so you know
40:19 - if a client ever comes along and says
40:20 - hey you know i hired joe developer to do
40:23 - the software work for me and he bungled
40:25 - my app and i'm suing them for damages
40:28 - well if they're contracted with an llc
40:29 - generally speaking they can sue the llc
40:31 - and not the individual so having an llc
40:35 - really does provide you
40:37 - with liability protection which can be
40:39 - really crucial when you're going into
40:40 - business
40:42 - one of the other big benefits of having
40:43 - all
40:44 - an llc which again is what we have
40:47 - is that comes with several tax
40:48 - advantages
40:50 - namely allows you to save on uh what
40:53 - would be self-employment taxes that you
40:55 - would pay if you're just working as a
40:56 - sole proprietor
40:58 - the discussion on how uh
41:01 - having an llc can save you on
41:03 - self-employment taxes it can be quite
41:06 - lengthy and i've actually done a
41:07 - separate video
41:08 - on that previously for free code camp
41:10 - we're going to link to that video in the
41:12 - description below okay so when you're
41:14 - trying to decide what to do i would
41:16 - suggest watching that video but again
41:17 - the first thing i would suggest you do
41:19 - is talk to some kind of business law
41:21 - attorney or corporate counsel on what is
41:23 - the best fit for your particular
41:26 - situation in your particular location to
41:28 - meet your particular goals
41:30 - so
41:31 - the one thing i want to stress in this
41:33 - is
41:34 - don't just run out and start doing work
41:37 - figure out what kind of entity it is you
41:39 - should probably form and get that entity
41:42 - formed before you
41:43 - go out and
41:45 - and get the appropriate licenses before
41:47 - you go out and start trying to
41:50 - hustle up work for your new business
41:52 - so
41:53 - now that we've talked about the need to
41:55 - form some kind of business sanity or to
41:57 - minimum get the appropriate licenses
41:59 - we're all done talking about the
42:01 - planning stage for your new business
42:03 - your new business is officially planned
42:04 - congratulations it is now time to
42:07 - actually get started on doing some work
42:08 - and making some money so let's get to it
42:22 - okay at this point of our video we've
42:24 - just talked about the planning stages of
42:25 - your business in other words you've
42:27 - decided to become a freelance developer
42:29 - and you've done all that initial
42:31 - planning
42:32 - so you can have a business that's going
42:34 - to run well and run properly and be well
42:36 - thought out and you're not just going to
42:37 - go out and try to open up your own shop
42:39 - and haphazardly go about your business
42:41 - in other words because you've planned
42:43 - things out you're set up for success
42:46 - now we need to talk about some things
42:47 - you need to do initially to actually get
42:49 - the doors open to your new enterprise
42:51 - okay
42:52 - and those three those
42:54 - areas that you need to get knocked out
42:57 - first are going to really fall into two
42:59 - categories one is administrative tasks
43:02 - that you need to get set up and ready to
43:04 - go before you start taking customers and
43:06 - the second is marketing items that you
43:09 - need to get set up and ready to roll
43:11 - before you start taking customers
43:13 - and the third thing i would say you need
43:15 - to do on top of those is before you even
43:17 - start taking a customer is decide right
43:19 - now you're going to be a continuous
43:21 - learner and i'll talk about all three of
43:24 - these in a minute and what i mean by
43:26 - each of them but the one thing i want to
43:28 - stress before we get into
43:30 - your checklist and things to do when it
43:32 - comes to starting your own business
43:34 - is the importance of starting off on the
43:36 - right foot okay in other words you need
43:39 - to have
43:40 - all your
43:41 - administrative and clerical and legal
43:43 - requirements met before you start taking
43:46 - customers you need to have a lot of your
43:48 - marketing infrastructure in place before
43:51 - you go out and start taking customers
43:54 - and you also need to be just learning
43:55 - about new things before you start taking
43:57 - customers the reason i say especially
44:00 - when it comes to
44:01 - your administrative and marketing stuff
44:03 - that you need to have these things
44:04 - organized and have all your ducks in a
44:06 - row before you really start trying to
44:08 - run your business is because if you
44:10 - don't get these things organized now
44:12 - then running your business later is
44:14 - going to be
44:16 - much harder just think of it like this
44:18 - um you know you don't get you don't get
44:22 - very well organized uh when you start up
44:25 - shop as a result there were documents
44:28 - you were supposed to file with the irs
44:30 - or the secretary of state that didn't
44:33 - get filed but then you just started
44:34 - taking customers right and then you're
44:37 - right in the middle of a coding project
44:39 - and you get a notice from the secretary
44:41 - of state that some items need to be
44:43 - taken care of immediately otherwise you
44:45 - will no longer be legally allowed to do
44:47 - business
44:49 - this means you would have to stop your
44:50 - coding project in the middle of what
44:51 - you're doing to go deal with an
44:53 - administrative headache that should have
44:54 - been dealt with before as a result
44:58 - your project's probably going to be
44:59 - delayed to the client the client is
45:01 - going to be unhappy you may have to give
45:02 - them a partial discount if not
45:05 - a refund and it's just going to create a
45:07 - whole host of headaches for you okay so
45:10 - in other words by having all your
45:12 - administrative tasks lined up completed
45:16 - those initial tasks just done and
45:18 - organized
45:19 - you help avoid those fires from popping
45:22 - up later that you then have to stop what
45:23 - you're doing and put out and by being
45:25 - organized in the beginning you make more
45:28 - money later and the same is true with
45:29 - your marketing if you've got your
45:30 - marketing infrastructure in place then
45:32 - you don't have to stop what you're doing
45:34 - later in in a mad panic to try to drum
45:36 - up clients okay
45:37 - so
45:39 - the one thing again i just cannot stress
45:41 - enough is
45:42 - get your all your get all your ducks in
45:44 - a row and get organized before you even
45:47 - start taking customers so again let's
45:49 - look at it from an administrative
45:51 - standpoint a marketing standpoint and
45:53 - then things you need to be learning
45:54 - about on an ongoing basis
46:06 - okay when starting your company there
46:07 - are going to be several essentially what
46:09 - i call administrative tasks that you're
46:11 - going to need to get taken care of and
46:13 - out of the way and again as i stress in
46:15 - the introduction of this section you
46:16 - want to get these tasks taken care of
46:18 - now so that they don't become problems
46:20 - later so by getting all these things out
46:23 - of the way you can actually focus on the
46:25 - important thing which is doing dev work
46:27 - okay
46:28 - so there's a few different things you
46:30 - want to get out of the way up front
46:32 - number one is you got to decide if
46:35 - you're going to form a company or work
46:36 - as a sole proprietor i talked at a
46:38 - previous section of this video
46:41 - about why we use an llc in our business
46:44 - talk with an attorney or a lawyer um you
46:46 - know get a consultation with a business
46:48 - law lawyer about whether you should form
46:51 - a corporation whether you should form an
46:52 - llc uh you know uh whether you form some
46:56 - kind of partnership in other words talk
46:57 - to an attorney to see what's best for
47:00 - your particular situation uh we use an
47:02 - llc in our business and i know a lot of
47:04 - times that's what an attorney is going
47:06 - to suggest to you but talk to a lawyer
47:07 - and figure out what actually is the best
47:10 - course for you given your particular
47:11 - needs your particular circumstances the
47:14 - laws and regulations of where you live
47:16 - and so on and so forth
47:18 - so number one is get your company formed
47:20 - but
47:21 - after your company is formed it's
47:24 - important to make sure that you're
47:25 - keeping up with the
47:26 - business requirements of wherever you
47:29 - live so for example in ohio where i live
47:32 - once you form your company and you get
47:33 - your business license you don't need to
47:35 - renew your business license every year
47:37 - but there are other states where you do
47:39 - need to renew your business life license
47:41 - every year in nevada
47:43 - for example along with renewing your
47:45 - business license every year you have to
47:46 - file what's called a list of officers
47:49 - every year so the reason i'm telling you
47:51 - all this is
47:53 - the
47:53 - to stress the importance of the fact
47:55 - that
47:56 - the rules and regulations you have to
47:58 - follow are going to be different
47:59 - depending on where you live so it's
48:02 - really important that you know the
48:04 - regulations and rules of where you live
48:06 - and you keep up with them and again
48:07 - having a lawyer will help you to do
48:09 - these things
48:10 - if you don't keep up
48:12 - with those regulations and you might
48:13 - lose your ability to do business um if
48:16 - you're you know if you're in a place
48:17 - that you have to renew your business
48:19 - license every year and you don't renew
48:21 - it you may actually be committing a
48:22 - crime by engaging in business without
48:25 - having the appropriate licensing so in
48:27 - addition to getting your company formed
48:30 - make sure you're
48:32 - aware of your local regulations and that
48:33 - you're keeping up with them so number
48:35 - one is decide what kind of entity you're
48:37 - going to form and keep up with your
48:40 - local rules and regulations
48:42 - number two is to get a separate address
48:44 - for your business
48:47 - generally speaking i personally consider
48:49 - it a bad idea to use your home address
48:51 - as your business address there's no
48:53 - reason you can't but that means for
48:55 - example putting your home address on
48:57 - your company website that means putting
49:00 - your home address on any contracts you
49:03 - sign with clients that means having
49:04 - business mail
49:06 - come to your house so on so forth
49:09 - for just personal peace of mind reasons
49:11 - it can be a good idea to have a separate
49:14 - address for your business and then also
49:16 - if you're going to be forming a separate
49:18 - entity like an llc there may be other
49:20 - benefits to having a separate address
49:22 - and you'd want to talk about those
49:25 - benefits with an attorney as well
49:27 - in terms of where to have a separate
49:29 - address uh lots of uh
49:32 - excuse me
49:33 - lots of freelance developers will use
49:36 - just a post office box since a lot of
49:38 - freelancers are working out of their
49:39 - house if you're working at a shared
49:41 - space such as a wework or a regis a lot
49:44 - of times you can have that shared office
49:45 - space and receive mail there so if
49:48 - you're considering one of those kinds of
49:49 - spaces ask them what kind of services
49:52 - they offer in terms of you know using uh
49:55 - their addresses your business address
49:56 - receiving mail there and
49:58 - things of that nature so post office box
50:01 - some kind of shared office space
50:04 - there in other words there are low cost
50:06 - options for having a separate mailing
50:08 - address
50:09 - for your business
50:11 - third thing is to get a separate bank
50:13 - account for your company for this you'll
50:15 - need an ein from the irs that's an
50:18 - employer identification number you'll
50:20 - need that ein if you are starting a
50:23 - separate entity such as an llc or
50:25 - corporation or something like that
50:28 - you want to have a separate bank account
50:29 - for your business for a few reasons
50:32 - number one if you're starting a
50:34 - separate entity such as an llc or
50:36 - corporation
50:37 - that entity is a separate you know
50:40 - essentially a separate person from you
50:42 - so your bank account needs to be kept
50:44 - separate from that
50:45 - number two it helps you keep your book
50:47 - straight in terms of
50:49 - uh what's a personal expense and um
50:51 - what's a business expense number three
50:53 - having a separate account for your
50:55 - business allows you to stay a lot more
50:56 - disciplined
50:58 - when it comes to budgeting your business
51:00 - finances
51:01 - one of the biggest reasons though for
51:02 - having a separate bank account is the
51:04 - legal reasons that an attorney will tell
51:06 - you about you protect yourself and your
51:08 - business by
51:10 - having a separate account for your
51:11 - business and that is something to talk
51:14 - about with a lawyer
51:15 - after you've started a bank account and
51:18 - you know you've got your business
51:19 - address and all that stuff there are
51:21 - certain software
51:23 - software services and just professional
51:25 - services you want to sign up for
51:28 - you know for your new business and that
51:29 - brings us to the fourth thing on my list
51:31 - which is software and services that you
51:34 - need to sign up for the first of those
51:36 - is to get some type of a business suite
51:38 - such as g suite from google or office
51:40 - 365 from microsoft
51:43 - these will make it much easier for you
51:44 - to have a branded email
51:46 - so in other words instead of
51:49 - you know
51:50 - instead of your personal email or
51:51 - instead of new developer at gmail.com
51:54 - you know you can actually have an email
51:56 - on your own domain which you don't have
51:57 - to have a business suite like g suite in
51:59 - office 365 to do this obviously but it
52:02 - makes managing your email easier and the
52:03 - big benefit of those
52:05 - types of business suites is they include
52:07 - other services such as
52:09 - uh calendaring uh uh cloud drive storage
52:13 - and a few other things that are specific
52:15 - to business um i'd
52:17 - they're relatively inexpensive and i
52:19 - would strongly suggest signing one of
52:21 - them up we use g suite in our business
52:23 - and it makes our life a whole lot easier
52:26 - you want to sign up for your accounting
52:28 - software that is
52:30 - uh you know how you're going to do your
52:32 - bookkeeping there are a lot of options
52:34 - here there's quickbooks online there's
52:36 - wave apps there's freshbooks we
52:38 - personally use wave in our business i
52:40 - find it to be very easy to use and the
52:42 - price is right because it's free
52:44 - for you know for certain services so
52:47 - again we use wave but that's not what
52:49 - you have to use but definitely you want
52:51 - to sign up for accounting software um
52:54 - you know so you can do your uh
52:56 - you know so you can do your uh
52:57 - bookkeeping i can't stress enough the
52:59 - importance of regular bookkeeping and
53:01 - that's something we'll talk about a
53:03 - little bit later in this video the next
53:06 - thing you want to sign up for is credit
53:07 - card processing uh you know you sign up
53:10 - for square uh get credit card processing
53:12 - through into it wave who we do our
53:14 - accounting through also offers credit
53:16 - card processing
53:17 - your clients are going to pay you with a
53:19 - credit card or debit card the
53:21 - overwhelming majority of the time um and
53:24 - so a you want to have something where
53:25 - you can send them an online online
53:27 - invoice all the services i just
53:28 - mentioned do that you want them to be
53:30 - able to pay it online with credit card
53:31 - or a debit card one of the reasons i say
53:34 - to get this set up now even if you don't
53:36 - have a customer is
53:38 - just think about it for a minute it's a
53:39 - little bit awkward if
53:41 - client number one calls you talks to you
53:43 - on the phone says okay i want you to
53:46 - build my app you tell them it's three
53:47 - thousand dollars and they say great send
53:49 - me an invoice and you don't even have
53:51 - your software set up yet to send them
53:53 - the invoice so in other words get your
53:55 - software set up now and your billing set
53:57 - up now and your credit card processing
53:59 - all set up now
54:01 - and you can send them the invoice right
54:03 - away it doesn't take long to get this
54:05 - stuff signed up so just get it done now
54:07 - there is no reason to be doing it later
54:10 - when you know when you need to send some
54:11 - to the client just get out of the way
54:12 - and sign up right now
54:14 - the next software next service i should
54:17 - say you're going to want to sign up is a
54:18 - payroll service we use the full service
54:21 - payroll
54:23 - offerings from intuit which is the
54:25 - parent company of quickbooks
54:28 - if you are starting an llc an s corp
54:31 - or uh an llc to be taxed as an s corp i
54:34 - should say or a corporation you're going
54:37 - to need to pay yourself as an employee
54:39 - and again the specifics of that or
54:41 - something to talk about with a lawyer
54:43 - but you are going to need to pay
54:45 - yourself as an employee in addition to
54:48 - taking distributions from the business
54:50 - and
54:52 - once you start doing payroll as an
54:54 - employee you'll find there is just a lot
54:56 - of paperwork that's got to be filed with
54:57 - the irs get filed with the state and
55:00 - your local governments and all that fun
55:01 - stuff
55:02 - by having a payroll service to do that
55:04 - for you you save a massive amount of
55:06 - time
55:07 - we pay a fee every month
55:10 - to intuit full service payroll and they
55:12 - take care of all of our paperwork for us
55:14 - i mean 100 of it and it just makes our
55:17 - life so much easier it is so worth the
55:20 - cost and it allows us to stay in
55:22 - compliance in terms of everything we
55:24 - need to be filing
55:25 - in terms of payroll so there are other
55:28 - services you're going to need to sign up
55:30 - for and other software products you're
55:31 - going to need to
55:33 - sign up for but the ones i would stress
55:35 - immediately to make sure you're ready to
55:37 - roll with are again
55:39 - your business suites this is g suite
55:41 - office 365
55:43 - zoho any of those companies that have
55:45 - similar offerings excuse me your
55:48 - accounting software we use wave but
55:50 - again there's offerings such as
55:52 - quickbooks online uh freshbooks and
55:54 - several others sign up for a credit card
55:56 - processor such as with uh stripe
55:59 - wave
56:02 - square
56:03 - uh into a cr into it credit card
56:06 - processing any of those and the fourth
56:08 - one um on that list is to get signed up
56:10 - for a payroll service i just cannot
56:13 - stress all those things
56:14 - enough
56:16 - the next thing you're going to want to
56:17 - do as part of your administrative task
56:20 - getting going this is the fourth thing
56:22 - on our list remember first one was get
56:24 - your company an entity formed and know
56:25 - your licensing requirements second one
56:28 - was get your business address third one
56:30 - was get your bank account set up
56:33 - fourth one i'm i'm sorry so fourth one
56:35 - was your software and services fifth
56:37 - thing you're going to want to do
56:39 - is
56:40 - uh get your contracts ready these are
56:42 - the contracts you're going to send to
56:44 - customers so in other words let's say
56:45 - i'm your customer i call you i say i
56:47 - want you to build an app for me and then
56:49 - uh you give me a quote me three thousand
56:52 - dollars i say great send me over a
56:54 - contract so i can sign it this is a form
56:56 - contract that you will send me
56:59 - or mostly form contract at least that
57:00 - you would send me to
57:03 - for me to sign agreeing that you're
57:05 - going to do the work and what i'm going
57:06 - to pay you and so on so forth
57:09 - there are places you can get these types
57:10 - of contracts such as legalzoom
57:13 - there are problems with
57:14 - just getting forms off the internet
57:16 - though they may not be the right call
57:18 - for your situation it is very much worth
57:21 - the money to pay a small business lawyer
57:23 - to look over some for
57:25 - form contracts for you and give you some
57:27 - feedback and help you make sure you're
57:29 - on the right track in terms of the forms
57:30 - you're sending off to potential clients
57:32 - to sign so
57:34 - you know like i said you can pull a form
57:36 - off of legalzoom
57:38 - my strong advice would be to talk to an
57:39 - attorney though and have them go over
57:41 - any contracts uh that you may be
57:43 - thinking of putting in your document
57:45 - bank to send the clients and then you
57:47 - know once the attorneys reviewed them
57:49 - you know you can start sending them off
57:51 - and because contracts are so important
57:53 - in your business
57:54 - what we're going to do is at the end of
57:55 - this section of our video we're going to
57:57 - have a separate lecture from an attorney
57:59 - named carrie ross carrie is a business
58:01 - law attorney in the dayton ohio area and
58:04 - she's been kind enough to put together
58:05 - some information on things to look out
58:07 - for and to make sure of when you're
58:09 - putting together the contracts
58:12 - the next thing and last thing on my list
58:14 - to sign up for and this is item number
58:16 - seven
58:17 - is insurance for your business
58:20 - uh specifically professional liability
58:22 - insurance
58:23 - what this is some what this does i
58:25 - should say is it allows you to be
58:27 - protected from liability in the event
58:29 - that one of your customers ever sues you
58:31 - so let's say you know a customer hires
58:33 - you to build a website and they say hey
58:37 - you know you did something wrong as a
58:39 - result they don't appear in search
58:40 - engines or
58:42 - um you know they hire you to build an
58:44 - app and
58:46 - they claim you did something wrong and
58:47 - they lost business as a result of it and
58:49 - then they want to sue you
58:52 - having insurance it means that you could
58:54 - just turn the lawsuit over to your
58:56 - insurance
58:58 - even if you don't agree with the lawsuit
58:59 - again your insurance will cover it and
59:01 - your insurance would pay all your legal
59:03 - bills i mean we've never been sued in
59:05 - our business
59:06 - but given a really small cost of
59:08 - carrying insurance it just lets me sleep
59:10 - better at night so i think right now our
59:13 - premiums just went up so right now we're
59:15 - paying call it a hundred dollars a year
59:17 - it's really not very much at all in the
59:20 - grand scheme of things so sign up for
59:22 - professional liability insurance um for
59:25 - your business uh just call geico or you
59:28 - know any similar company and
59:30 - they can get you pointed in the right
59:31 - direction as to who you want to sign up
59:33 - for with that so your administrative
59:36 - tasks again to get out of the way before
59:39 - you even start taking customers are get
59:41 - your company formed and know your
59:44 - legal requirements get a business
59:46 - address get a business bank account get
59:48 - your required or needed software and
59:50 - services signed up get uh your contracts
59:54 - that you're going to be sending clients
59:55 - ironed out preferably reviewed by an
59:58 - attorney and also get an insurance
60:01 - policy signed up and as i mentioned a
60:04 - moment ago let's get to attorney kerry
60:05 - ross for her lecture on contracts in
60:07 - your business
60:24 - hi my name is carrie ross i'm a business
60:27 - attorney and an estate planning attorney
60:29 - with ross legal services in dayton ohio
60:32 - i've been asked to speak with you today
60:34 - about the importance of written
60:36 - contracts in your software development
60:38 - business
60:39 - we're going to talk about a few key
60:41 - points in this segment
60:43 - first the importance generally of
60:46 - well-written contracts throughout all
60:48 - aspects of your business and then
60:49 - specifically in connection with your
60:51 - software development services
60:53 - second we'll talk about typical formats
60:56 - for
60:57 - development service contracts and some
60:59 - key provisions that you may want to
61:00 - include in your form to use with your
61:02 - clients
61:04 - last we'll talk about some resources
61:05 - available to you
61:07 - for purposes of preparing your contract
61:10 - to use with your clients
61:12 - the first thing i'll say is
61:14 - having a well-written contract
61:16 - is very important
61:18 - for all aspects of your business
61:20 - you might be entering into a lease for
61:23 - office space employment agreements
61:25 - hiring your own independent contractors
61:27 - or simply purchasing goods
61:30 - in each case
61:32 - review the contract negotiate it make
61:35 - sure that the final product matches what
61:37 - your intentions are so that the contract
61:39 - cannot be questioned
61:42 - a purpose of a contract is to
61:44 - memorialize your business transaction
61:46 - it's your reference guide throughout an
61:49 - ongoing transaction if there's a
61:51 - question about who's obligated to do
61:53 - what and when
61:55 - it's also your first line of defense in
61:57 - the event of a dispute your contract may
62:00 - even have provisions that say what to do
62:03 - in the event of a dispute do you have to
62:05 - go to arbitration for example or are
62:07 - there notice requirements before you can
62:09 - take any kind of legal action
62:13 - when not reduced to writing
62:15 - a handshake deal or something you've
62:17 - agreed to via email or if it's just
62:21 - poorly written in a written contract
62:24 - you're open to
62:26 - disputes he said she said problems
62:28 - coming up down the road
62:30 - including maybe not getting paid maybe
62:32 - having to sue someone or being sued for
62:35 - breach of contract or maybe additional
62:38 - damages and sometimes it's all of the
62:40 - above
62:41 - a real world example in the software
62:44 - development field
62:45 - would be if you agreed to develop an app
62:48 - for a customer
62:49 - and it has certain functionality
62:51 - delivery dates you comply with all of
62:53 - that
62:54 - at the end of the agreement once you've
62:56 - delivered your app and been paid you're
62:59 - asked to provide ongoing maintenance and
63:01 - rather than memorializing the terms of
63:03 - that specifically in a contract
63:06 - you think that everything's gone well
63:08 - with this customer you agree to provide
63:09 - maintenance
63:11 - two or three years go by
63:13 - and all of a sudden the technology on
63:15 - which your app was based is being phased
63:18 - out it no longer functions
63:20 - and your client is looking to you to say
63:23 - g as part of your maintenance maybe you
63:25 - need to rebuild the entire app and you
63:28 - may say well that wasn't in the scope of
63:30 - the maintenance agreement so where do
63:32 - you look you look at your written
63:33 - contract and if you haven't memorialized
63:35 - the terms of that clearly you could be
63:37 - left in a lurch
63:39 - so at this point let's turn our
63:41 - attention to
63:42 - the typical format for software
63:44 - development contracts and some key
63:46 - provisions you may want to include
63:58 - so as we discussed in the last section
64:00 - your written contract with your customer
64:02 - is going to be the place where you
64:03 - protect your business's interest and in
64:06 - the context of app development or
64:09 - software development you're protecting
64:12 - you your talent is what's delivering the
64:14 - project and the product at the end of
64:16 - the day so that's really what your
64:18 - contract is geared to protect
64:21 - clients will ask you to provide a
64:23 - contract nine times out of ten unless
64:25 - you're working with the microsoft's or
64:28 - amazons or large development houses of
64:30 - the world
64:32 - your clients will not normally have
64:33 - their own development contract form so
64:36 - you want to be prepared when you make
64:38 - that sales pitch in advance so that
64:40 - you're not holding up your sales process
64:42 - or closing your deal
64:44 - because you need to go back to the
64:45 - drawing board and come up with your own
64:46 - contract
64:48 - if a client does present you with their
64:50 - own form it's really important to read
64:53 - this closely understand what you're
64:54 - agreeing to
64:56 - before you finalize it
64:58 - you may not feel like you have that much
65:00 - leverage and you may not
65:02 - but as long as you know what you're
65:03 - signing ahead of time and make sure that
65:05 - it's not going to impact your activities
65:07 - going forward then that's important
65:10 - things to watch out for would be
65:12 - restrictive covenants that prevent you
65:14 - from
65:16 - creating the same or similar
65:18 - software or applications for people in
65:22 - competing industries
65:23 - so non-competes non-solicitations those
65:26 - types of things should really be watch
65:28 - outs
65:30 - the common format that i typically see
65:33 - for services agreements
65:35 - is an independent contractor agreement
65:37 - plus a statement of work that is
65:39 - attached to the back of it you can call
65:41 - it an independent contractor agreement
65:43 - you can call it a services agreement
65:45 - software development agreement that
65:47 - really doesn't matter as much as the
65:48 - fact that you're going to have your
65:50 - general basic terms that stay for the
65:53 - most part the same from customer to
65:55 - customer in your independent contract
65:57 - agreement and this attachment on the
65:58 - back where you can customize the
66:00 - transaction to match what you're
66:02 - actually being asked to perform
66:05 - common provisions that you would see
66:07 - within the independent contractor
66:09 - section clearly you're going to identify
66:11 - the parties the date you're signing the
66:13 - agreement in each of these right off the
66:15 - bat
66:16 - but in the contractor agreement section
66:18 - you'll cover things like termination
66:20 - rights who has the right to end the
66:22 - contract for what reasons and what
66:25 - procedures in place when that happens do
66:28 - you get paid for partially completed
66:30 - work
66:30 - or how does that work
66:33 - things like insurance
66:35 - indemnification obligations where you're
66:38 - risk sharing with the other side in case
66:40 - something goes wrong those would be
66:42 - negotiated in your independent
66:43 - contractor agreement
66:45 - if you're granting any warranties for
66:47 - your work or specifically saying you're
66:50 - not granting warranties for your work
66:52 - that's typically handled in this section
66:54 - as well
66:56 - a word of caution there depending on
66:58 - where you are most state statutes have
67:01 - specific requirements that imply certain
67:04 - warranties unless you disclaim them
67:05 - specifically and if you are going to
67:08 - disclaim them you may have to write that
67:10 - in a certain way in your agreement to
67:12 - make it enforceable so please check in
67:15 - with local council or really do some
67:17 - statutory research if you have that
67:19 - available to you to make sure you're
67:21 - complying with the restrictions
67:23 - you may also handle things such as the
67:25 - venue for any lawsuits that potentially
67:28 - come up
67:28 - governing law that would apply to your
67:30 - contract particularly if you're located
67:33 - in different states than your customer
67:36 - or alternative dispute resolution
67:38 - provisions that may require arbitration
67:40 - or mediation prior to
67:43 - starting a lawsuit
67:45 - now the statement of work
67:47 - is the juicy part this is where you get
67:49 - to customize the work or customize the
67:52 - language to match the work you're
67:54 - performing so you really want to get
67:56 - into the deliverables here in specific
67:59 - detail what are your deliverables and
68:02 - when are you expected to deliver them is
68:04 - this
68:05 - a
68:05 - pretty specific
68:07 - project that's due all at one time is it
68:10 - a phased timeline for delivery
68:13 - what is due when
68:14 - and what are your obligations
68:17 - related to that payment terms you want
68:20 - to make sure that you're specifically
68:22 - saying when you want to get paid and for
68:24 - what if you're delivering parts of the
68:26 - project along a timeline will you get
68:28 - paid as those things get delivered do
68:31 - you get paid on an hourly rate a flat
68:33 - fee rate
68:34 - what are the terms of your payment and
68:36 - when are they due
68:38 - and keep in mind if this is your form
68:40 - start where you want the payment terms
68:42 - to start and let your customer negotiate
68:45 - a change from there if needed
68:48 - you may want to deal with specifically
68:50 - customer responsibilities depending on
68:53 - what you're doing you may need the
68:55 - customer or a customer representative
68:57 - assigned to you
68:58 - to provide you with information or
69:01 - access to systems to make sure their app
69:03 - works what happens if they don't do that
69:06 - and that delay is your timeline are you
69:07 - responsible or are they responsible
69:10 - here is also the place where you deal
69:12 - with ongoing obligations
69:15 - after the ultimate project is delivered
69:17 - will you be maintaining the project are
69:19 - you responsible for updates for the
69:21 - project
69:23 - do you have any kind of other ongoing
69:25 - application or i'm sorry ongoing
69:27 - obligation
69:28 - uh after the delivery is done
69:31 - so these are the kinds of things that
69:32 - you're going to want to really nail down
69:35 - inside of your independent contractor
69:37 - agreement and the attached scope of work
69:51 - so
69:52 - now we've gone over the need for written
69:54 - contracts throughout your business and
69:56 - we've specifically talked about the
69:58 - format you may want to use and some
70:00 - provisions that you might include in
70:02 - your software development agreement to
70:03 - be used with your own clients
70:06 - this may seem pretty overwhelming at
70:08 - this point a lot to think about the good
70:10 - news is there are some resources
70:12 - available to help you as you start to
70:14 - develop your own form the first and most
70:16 - obvious choice is to contact an attorney
70:19 - to help prepare the contract on your
70:21 - behalf you can explain your needs what
70:23 - the contract will be used for and have
70:26 - the attorney prepare that with those
70:27 - views in mind
70:29 - this may not be in your budget i
70:31 - understand that it is possible to
70:33 - negotiate a flat fee with a lot of
70:36 - attorneys which may save you some money
70:38 - over an hourly rate arrangement it may
70:40 - also be possible to negotiate a reduced
70:44 - rate for a start-up business
70:46 - if this is still not within your budget
70:48 - i would encourage you to contact your
70:50 - local chamber of commerce or if you have
70:53 - like we do in dayton

71:14 - numerous internet resources that you can
71:17 - use to start a form
71:20 - such as nolo.com might be a good
71:22 - starting point you can find these forms
71:25 - and i keep stressing starting point
71:27 - because as i mentioned in the previous
71:28 - segment there are specific statutory
71:31 - requirements depending on what kind of
71:34 - services you'll be offering and what you
71:36 - want your contract to cover i would
71:38 - encourage all of you to at least have an
71:40 - attorney read your form remembering that

71:48 - over again with your clients

71:54 - contact me directly good luck
72:05 - okay a big thanks to kerry for talking
72:07 - about the importance of contracts and
72:08 - what to look for in a written contract
72:10 - now let's talk about what you need to be
72:12 - doing to market your new business
72:21 - okay now that you're ready to start up
72:22 - as a freelance developer let's talk
72:24 - about some things you need to get out of
72:26 - the way immediately so that you'll be
72:27 - able to market your business
72:29 - properly and there are other items other
72:32 - than the ones i'm going to talk about
72:34 - which you'll need however these are just
72:35 - the ones i'm stressing in this video
72:38 - some of them may seem obvious but you
72:39 - would be surprised how many people
72:41 - decide to open up their doors without
72:43 - having all these items
72:45 - for lack of a better word ready to go so
72:48 - let's go over a few things to make sure
72:50 - you have you know before you start
72:51 - trying to market yourself to customers
72:53 - number one is you need a website for
72:56 - your new business number two is need a
72:58 - branded email you need a phone number
73:01 - uh you need to have business cards you
73:03 - need to sign up your various review
73:05 - profiles on uh websites such as google
73:08 - my business and
73:10 - yelp and
73:12 - things of that nature
73:13 - you need to flush out your linkedin
73:15 - profile
73:16 - and again these are just some of the
73:18 - must-haves i mean obviously
73:20 - there are other ones so
73:21 - let's go through each of these in turn
73:24 - number one
73:25 - start a start a website for your new
73:27 - development business you would be
73:29 - surprised i have actually seen people
73:31 - who go out and hold themselves out as
73:33 - freelance software developers freelance
73:35 - web developers and they haven't they
73:38 - have not actually put up a website for
73:40 - themselves or if they have just to be
73:42 - frank it looks like garbage so put up
73:45 - something nice um your website is
73:48 - important for multiple reasons number
73:50 - one it's essentially your storefront
73:52 - right
73:53 - think of it like this if you were going
73:55 - to hire somebody to build you a website
73:57 - would you be a little concerned if they
73:58 - didn't have a nice website for
74:00 - themselves of course you would so have a
74:02 - website up for yourself before you start
74:04 - trying to hustle up business
74:06 - and
74:07 - make it nice make it look like you
74:09 - actually know what you're doing make it
74:10 - look like it's something you actually
74:11 - care about
74:13 - if you're looking for inspiration or
74:15 - patterns or even
74:17 - some good foundational templates
74:19 - to use for a website for yourself i
74:21 - would suggest going to the website html5
74:24 - up
74:25 - these are free html5 templates that
74:29 - again are pretty good to use uh you know
74:32 - if you want to just get something up
74:33 - quicker and sooner rather than later
74:35 - again that website is html5 up
74:38 - or at a minimum
74:40 - you know if that's at a minimum i should
74:42 - say
74:43 - or build yourself something really nice
74:45 - from the ground up again this is you
74:48 - showing off yourself as a developer so
74:51 - have a website and make sure it looks
74:53 - nice
74:55 - number two is a branded email for your
74:58 - business
74:59 - um
75:01 - you gotta realize as a freelance
75:02 - developer you're gonna be dealing with a
75:04 - lot of people who can
75:06 - barely use a computer or barely use
75:08 - their newfangled smartphone so
75:11 - you know having a branded email goes a
75:13 - long way towards validating you with
75:15 - people
75:16 - um if you email somebody from
75:19 - you know your name at gmail.com you
75:22 - might as well be emailing them from
75:23 - brand new developer at gmail.com it goes
75:26 - a long way towards legitimizing you
75:29 - having a branded email we talked a
75:31 - little bit in the last section about
75:33 - signing up a business suite such as g
75:35 - suite or office 365 you'll get a branded
75:38 - email as part of that but don't start
75:40 - emailing potential clients and
75:41 - interacting with potential clients from
75:44 - um you know a free email account such as
75:46 - gmail yahoo you know outlook.com or
75:49 - anything like that the third thing to
75:51 - get is a phone number dedicated to your
75:54 - business
75:55 - there are a lot of reasons uh to keep
75:58 - your cell phone and your
76:00 - business line separate
76:02 - do you want your
76:04 - personal number on your website probably
76:06 - not uh
76:08 - there
76:09 - do you want to be able to go out at
76:11 - night and have your phone ring and not
76:13 - be sure if it's a customer or if it's
76:16 - just a friend of yours or a family
76:17 - member calling i'm sure you would like
76:19 - to be able to separate your work in your
76:20 - business lines
76:22 - fortunately having a separate business
76:24 - phone number doesn't require you to go
76:26 - out and pay for a second cell phone you
76:28 - certainly can if you want but you don't
76:29 - have to
76:30 - you can use a free service from google
76:32 - called google voice and that will allow
76:35 - you to essentially have a free
76:37 - voice over internet line
76:39 - that will go to your cell phone so
76:41 - you'll
76:42 - basically have two numbers on your cell
76:44 - phone google voice again is free
76:47 - you know you can talk and text talk text
76:49 - make calls from it receive calls um you
76:52 - know uh my wife has a google voice line
76:54 - uh for her business on her phone and
76:57 - it's free it's easy to use i mean i
76:59 - would suggest for uh your business phone
77:01 - number uh using google voice uh
77:04 - the next thing you're going to want to
77:05 - get is business cards
77:07 - you're going to be dealing especially as
77:09 - a freelance developer you're going to be
77:10 - dealing with or are likely i should say
77:13 - to be dealing with a good number of
77:15 - local businesses
77:16 - and
77:17 - it is important to be able to hand them
77:19 - a business card uh with that being said
77:22 - i personally don't think it's worth it
77:23 - to
77:24 - spend a lot of money on your business
77:26 - cards you can get something that's
77:27 - adequate from vistaprint
77:29 - you know usually 50 bucks for a few
77:31 - hundred cards uh
77:34 - but having a business card that you can
77:35 - hand out is definitely important you
77:37 - will be surprised at how many people say
77:39 - to you oh okay do you have a card and
77:41 - you looks kind of silly if you don't
77:43 - have a business card to hand them so
77:45 - have your business cards with you and
77:47 - you know like ready to roll before you
77:48 - even start trying to hustle up business
77:51 - the next thing you're going to want to
77:53 - do is get your various review profiles
77:55 - lined up these are your profiles on
77:58 - websites such as yelp um the review
78:01 - section of the facebook page for your
78:02 - new business uh the review section on
78:04 - google my business
78:06 - and things like that these are places
78:08 - where
78:09 - uh your customers will leave you good
78:11 - reviews you're going to want to ask them
78:13 - for reviews we'll talk about that a
78:14 - little later but as i said these are
78:16 - places for your customers to leave you
78:18 - good reviews after you've completed work
78:20 - for them
78:22 - it's important that you get these review
78:23 - profiles signed up
78:25 - and they be proactive about getting
78:26 - reviews from customers
78:28 - because
78:29 - there are there are meaningful number of
78:31 - people who will not want to hire you
78:33 - unless they can find
78:34 - good reviews um about your services
78:37 - and the reason i say to get your review
78:39 - profile signed up before you even get
78:41 - your first customer is because then you
78:43 - are ready to ask that customer for a
78:45 - review
78:46 - you don't want to you know finish your
78:48 - first customer's project and then you
78:51 - know and then um
78:53 - not be in a position to ask them for
78:54 - reviews because you haven't even signed
78:56 - up the profiles yet so before you even
78:58 - start going out and trying to hustle up
78:59 - business
79:01 - get your review profiles signed up the
79:03 - primary ones i would focus on are
79:06 - again google my business
79:08 - yelp uh the review section of your
79:11 - facebook page um you know those would
79:13 - probably be the big ones
79:15 - uh the next thing is to
79:17 - completely flush out and uh
79:20 - uh come and uh kind of
79:23 - make your linkedin profile look really
79:25 - nice and complete make it really clear
79:27 - what skills you have uh you know hey you
79:29 - know if you hey i know css i know
79:32 - javascript i know html
79:35 - you know i'm fluent in other languages
79:38 - make sure those are all listed on your
79:40 - linkedin profile make sure your linkedin
79:41 - profile says that you are available for
79:44 - uh freelance work any certifications
79:47 - you've gotten from free code camp make
79:48 - sure your list those are listed on your
79:51 - linkedin profile there are also
79:53 - quick certification tests you can take
79:55 - from linkedin for example uh they have
79:58 - one for css uh only takes a few minutes
80:00 - to do maybe a half hour to do the test
80:03 - and you'll have a
80:05 - note citation on your linkedin page
80:07 - saying that you're
80:08 - you're considered certified in css
80:11 - and if as i said have your profile say
80:13 - that you're available for freelance work
80:15 - and you'll be surprised at how many
80:16 - people just start randomly reaching out
80:19 - to you through linkedin
80:21 - um you know for potential freelance work
80:24 - and also link even if someone's not
80:25 - reaching out to you linkedin is
80:27 - a place where people are going to look
80:29 - to validate you in addition to looking
80:31 - at the
80:32 - review profiles i mentioned a minute ago
80:35 - so those are the initial must-haves in
80:38 - terms of
80:41 - being ready to market your new business
80:43 - again just going through them real fast
80:45 - in order get a website up
80:47 - go to a website such as html5 up if
80:50 - you're looking for inspiration or for
80:53 - a quick template you can grab
80:55 - get a branded email again g suite office
80:58 - 365 zoho those kinds of services uh are
81:01 - going to give you that anyway get a
81:03 - phone number for your business uh
81:04 - dedicated to your business uh i would
81:06 - suggest using google voice that's what
81:08 - my wife uses in her business i've used
81:10 - it in the past it's free so i don't
81:12 - really see any reason starting out to
81:14 - pay for something get business cards
81:16 - again something from vistaprint is
81:18 - typically fine get your review profiles
81:21 - signed up uh
81:24 - you know we're talking about uh yelp the
81:26 - facebook review section google my
81:28 - business and get your linkedin profile
81:30 - completely fleshed out and nicely filled
81:31 - out and you do those things and you're
81:33 - in a good spot to start marketing
81:36 - start i gotta stress marketing your
81:38 - business so
81:40 - with all that said let's talk about why
81:42 - the last stage of getting your business
81:45 - officially started is to begin a process
81:48 - of lifelong learning and then we'll be
81:50 - done with this module
81:58 - okay so the last part of getting your
82:00 - business started is
82:02 - recognizing that you are now going to
82:05 - have to be a lifelong learner if you
82:06 - want to be a successful freelancer
82:09 - and
82:10 - what do i mean by this i mean the fact
82:13 - that
82:14 - successful business people
82:16 - are always trying to learn about new
82:18 - topics uh rel that in some way relate to
82:21 - their business
82:22 - it is a mistake to think that
82:25 - okay i'm
82:27 - you know finishing or i have finished uh
82:29 - the coding education i'm going to do at
82:31 - free code camp and i'm now done and i'm
82:34 - ready to strike out into the world
82:36 - completing free code camp is not the
82:40 - end of uh
82:42 - learning how to code
82:43 - it is the beginning of starting a career
82:46 - as a coder in other words it is just the
82:49 - first step and now you've got to start
82:51 - learning about a whole lot of other
82:52 - topics if you want to be successful as a
82:55 - freelancer because what you will quickly
82:58 - find out and when i say quickly i mean
83:00 - almost immediately find out
83:02 - once you go out on your own is that
83:04 - there is a whole lot of things that
83:06 - going to be go into being a business
83:09 - person
83:10 - uh besides learning how to code so
83:13 - one thing i cannot stress to you enough
83:16 - is um
83:18 - in your spare time just be reading on a
83:19 - regular basis uh you know try to read 30
83:22 - to 45 minutes a day at a at a minimum
83:25 - and i gotta stress the at a minimum and
83:27 - when i say read i don't mean um
83:29 - you know just random articles and
83:30 - magazines or fiction books or whatever
83:33 - uh i would really suggest trying to
83:35 - learn um as much as you can about people
83:38 - who have been very successful in their
83:40 - fields look at what traits made them
83:42 - successful and then try to emulate those
83:44 - traits
83:45 - in your own business and there's also
83:48 - just a lot of other books you can read
83:49 - that
83:50 - help you figure out what it is that
83:53 - successful people do in terms of the
83:55 - habits they keep the thing i can't
83:57 - stress enough is that you would when you
83:59 - read about successful people and people
84:02 - who have
84:03 - achieved a lot what you will see is
84:06 - common patterns common behaviors and
84:08 - common habits between all of them and it
84:11 - is important to remember that
84:13 - those people don't have
84:15 - those habits because they're successful
84:17 - they're successful because they have
84:18 - those habits so if you choose to have
84:21 - those habits in your own business and in
84:23 - your own life you can be
84:25 - successful as well so
84:27 - my my advice is just read early read
84:30 - often um about people who have been
84:33 - successful in their field and it doesn't
84:34 - even have to be a successful software
84:36 - developer like bill gates i mean just
84:37 - people who have been successful in
84:39 - any kind of business
84:41 - a few books i would suggest to get
84:44 - started with if you haven't read these
84:46 - already
84:47 - number one is profit first
84:50 - what this is is a book that talks about
84:55 - essentially
84:56 - accounting in your business but also how
84:58 - to set up a financial budget for your
85:00 - business
85:01 - a lot of businesses go out of go out of
85:04 - business due to poor financial
85:06 - management and now that you're a
85:08 - freelancer you are a business person
85:10 - like it or not and you don't want your
85:12 - business to fail due to poor financial
85:14 - management profit first does a pretty
85:17 - good job of putting together a system
85:19 - that is easy for people to follow um
85:23 - so if you're somebody who already has a
85:25 - lot of discipline and is already really
85:28 - good with managing finances and
85:30 - you're good at keeping personal and
85:32 - business finances separate on top of
85:33 - that
85:34 - this may not be the book for you but
85:36 - that being said i am willing to put a
85:38 - large number of people watching this
85:40 - video would be open to admitting that
85:41 - they've struggled with personal
85:43 - financial management at some point so
85:45 - reading profit first is good in a sense
85:47 - that it will give you an easy to follow
85:49 - system and just follow the system and
85:51 - your business's finances will take care
85:53 - of themselves so profit first is book
85:55 - number one
85:57 - book number two is how to win friends
85:59 - and influence people
86:01 - this is a good one to read because it
86:04 - really goes a long way in terms of
86:06 - giving some tips that can be useful in
86:09 - dealing with potential customers dealing
86:11 - with people after they've become your
86:13 - customers
86:14 - dealing with other vendors and just
86:16 - individuals you're going to have to deal
86:18 - with in the business world on
86:20 - you know just on a daily basis while the
86:23 - book isn't specifically about dealing
86:24 - with people in a business setting it
86:26 - really gives a lot of great information
86:28 - on how to deal with individuals in
86:30 - different situations in a broader
86:31 - context and if you're somebody that
86:35 - feels like how do i endear myself to
86:37 - people how do i sell how do i make
86:38 - people want to hire me this is probably
86:41 - a good book to read so number two is how
86:43 - to win friends and influence people by
86:45 - dale carnegie
86:46 - number three is the millionaire next
86:48 - door
86:49 - this is a book in which
86:52 - many millionaires were studied over a
86:54 - long period of time and it'll really
86:56 - dispel a lot of
86:58 - common misperceptions about individuals
87:01 - who are millionaires how they became
87:03 - millionaires the habits of millionaires
87:05 - and things of that nature it'll also go
87:08 - a long way in showing how millionaires
87:10 - stay millionaires through certain
87:12 - financial habits
87:13 - i personally think this book should be
87:15 - required reading before anyone graduates
87:17 - from high school in the united states
87:20 - so it's one i certainly cannot suggest
87:22 - enough that people should be read
87:25 - reading
87:26 - number four is a small time operator
87:29 - this is a book that deals with small
87:31 - business in general
87:33 - um
87:34 - everything from habits you should be
87:36 - keeping uh in terms of financial
87:38 - management to day-to-day operations to
87:40 - getting your taxes paid on time to you
87:43 - name it for anyone who has never worked
87:45 - for themself and is now going out as a
87:46 - freelance developer small time operator
87:48 - is a must read
87:51 - number four is the
87:53 - i'm sorry number five
87:54 - is the innovators by walter isaacson
87:57 - this is essentially a history of uh
88:02 - computing and computer science and it
88:04 - goes all the way from the creation of
88:06 - the
88:07 - first computer and the concepts of the
88:09 - first computer of ada lovelace all the
88:11 - way up through
88:12 - essentially where we are today and it'll
88:15 - really give you an appreciation of how
88:18 - no one person not even steve jobs not
88:21 - even bill gates not even name an
88:23 - individual
88:25 - no one person had
88:27 - an outsized
88:29 - impact on computing and has really just
88:31 - been kind of a brick by brick building
88:33 - of
88:34 - uh
88:35 - you know of uh computer science from the
88:37 - from its founding and through now and it
88:38 - really just gives you an appreciation
88:41 - of uh what what different individuals
88:43 - has done it's an inspiring book to read
88:46 - and i i just think it's a muslim must
88:48 - read for anyone who's just learned to
88:50 - code and is striking out on their own
88:52 - and the final book i would suggest
88:54 - reading is the everything store which is
88:57 - a story about amazon and the founding of
88:59 - amazon by jeff bezos and how the company
89:02 - grew uh to where it is today the thing
89:04 - you will really take away from this book
89:06 - when you read it is that amazon got
89:09 - where it is today in large part by a
89:11 - never-ending focus on customer service i
89:13 - mean
89:14 - whether it's just you as a freelance
89:16 - developer
89:18 - you know
89:19 - in your basement writing code or whether
89:20 - you're jeff bezos writing amazon running
89:23 - amazon and everything in between
89:26 - customer service has to be your prep
89:27 - number one priority there's can be no
89:30 - other priority that comes before
89:31 - customer service and reading the
89:33 - everything store will really uh help you
89:36 - understand this so like i said these are
89:39 - just a few suggestions um to get started
89:42 - and i would really suggest reading 30 to
89:44 - 45 minutes a day um
89:46 - for those of you watching this video
89:49 - you know if we could line everybody up a
89:50 - year from now for people who have
89:52 - succeeded as a freelancer and people who
89:54 - haven't i guarantee you the people who
89:56 - have succeeded have probably read more
89:59 - consistently than the people who haven't
90:01 - so you know with all of that said let's
90:03 - move on to the next part of our lessons
90:13 - okay we're to the point of our lessons
90:14 - where we're going to talk about how to
90:15 - get clients for your new business after
90:18 - all as a freelance web developer
90:19 - freelance software developer you're not
90:21 - going to be in business very long if you
90:22 - don't have customers right so really
90:24 - we're going to look at a few things
90:26 - number one we're going to look at how to
90:27 - get customers in the short term because
90:30 - you need revenue today and number two
90:32 - we're going to look at how to build your
90:33 - business over the long term how you get
90:35 - customers over the long term is going to
90:37 - be very different than how you
90:39 - immediately get customers today for
90:41 - your short term startup business all
90:43 - right so
90:44 - before we dive into those let's look at
90:46 - number one why is it important to
90:50 - understand the difference between the
90:51 - long term and the short term and then
90:53 - let's quickly talk about how to sell
90:54 - your services to people once you
90:56 - understand the
90:57 - need to focus on the long term
91:00 - you'll see the difference between that
91:01 - and short-term business building and
91:03 - then you'll also see that once you know
91:05 - how to sell yourself to people you can
91:07 - just be far more effective in terms of
91:09 - growing your business so first
91:12 - the need to focus on both the short-term
91:14 - and the long term in your business
91:17 - the need to focus on the short term is
91:19 - obvious right because as i said a moment
91:21 - ago if you don't have customers today
91:22 - you're going to be in business for about
91:23 - 30 seconds so you need to get customers
91:26 - today no one disputes that
91:29 - you may not be taking your dream jobs
91:31 - you may not be getting
91:32 - the work that is your first choice but
91:34 - you need work so
91:36 - again you're gonna
91:38 - go about doing things to get work today
91:42 - that are
91:45 - getting you work through not necessarily
91:47 - the most uh how shall we say sustainable
91:49 - ways okay but again you need work today
91:52 - so that's what you're gonna do
91:54 - over the long term however you're going
91:56 - to build a brand meaning that you're
91:58 - going to build a business where instead
92:00 - of you going out and getting work
92:02 - through non-sustainable means people are
92:04 - just coming to you and you're getting
92:06 - the work without having to put much
92:07 - effort into getting it this is work that
92:09 - will be higher paying this is work more
92:11 - along the lines of what you want to be
92:13 - doing long term and more importantly
92:16 - if you're not putting time and resources
92:17 - into getting that work it becomes much
92:19 - more profitable for you so
92:22 - if you only focus on the short term
92:25 - you can get some business and that's
92:26 - what you're going to have to do in the
92:28 - beginning but if that is your sole focus
92:30 - and you're confident you're just
92:32 - constantly and i do mean constantly
92:34 - in that state of trying to hustle up new
92:37 - work looking for the next job things of
92:39 - that nature and you just never really
92:41 - get your business out of second gear if
92:43 - however you keep your focus on building
92:45 - a long-term brand you grow your profits
92:48 - in your business really fast so that's
92:50 - why it's important to in the short term
92:53 - go out and get some clients do what you
92:54 - have to do to hustle up work but also be
92:56 - building a long-term brand so
92:59 - i cannot stress that enough
93:01 - number two is how to actually sell
93:03 - yourself to customers
93:05 - and eat whether you're trying to sell
93:07 - the people in the short term or whether
93:09 - you're trying to sell the people in the
93:10 - long term i cannot stress enough
93:13 - that you need to view yourself as a
93:15 - problem solver we talked about this in
93:17 - an earlier section of the video when we
93:19 - were talking about the need to provide
93:21 - value to your clients
93:24 - when you are selling yourself to your
93:25 - clients and trying to sell your services
93:27 - to a client what you need to do is come
93:30 - to learn about the client's business and
93:32 - identify the client's problems and
93:34 - explain how your software is or your
93:37 - website or whatever you're building
93:39 - explain how your product is going to
93:41 - solve those problems okay don't come to
93:44 - them and say here's my experience here's
93:46 - what i've done
93:48 - say you have this problem here's how i'm
93:51 - going to solve it people are going to be
93:53 - much much much and i mean much more
93:55 - receptive to that kind of an approach
93:58 - and you'll wind up doing
93:59 - a lot more in sales
94:01 - this is something i talked about at
94:02 - length in a previous video for free code
94:04 - camp and we're going to link to that
94:05 - video in the description below so we
94:07 - don't rehash too much of it here but
94:09 - when selling yourself to customers i
94:11 - cannot stress enough present yourself as
94:13 - a problem solver so in short
94:16 - you need customers in the short term
94:19 - we're going to talk in a moment about
94:20 - how to get those
94:22 - it's important that you keep a focus on
94:24 - building your brand long term and when
94:26 - selling yourself to customers it's
94:28 - really important that you present
94:29 - yourself as a solver of their problems
94:32 - all right so with all that said let's
94:34 - get on to how to build your business
94:35 - over the short term
94:44 - okay let's take a few minutes to talk
94:45 - about some things you're going to do to
94:46 - get clients in the short term as we just
94:48 - said in our intro the need to get
94:50 - clients in the short term for your
94:51 - freelance business is obvious right
94:53 - because after all if you don't get
94:54 - clients immediately you're not going to
94:56 - be working for yourself for very long
94:58 - so in just a moment i'm going to get
95:00 - into five different ways that you can
95:02 - go about getting clients immediately
95:04 - getting customers today and generating
95:06 - some revenue before i get into that
95:08 - though the one thing i want to stress is
95:09 - that the things you're going to do in
95:11 - the short term to get clients are going
95:13 - to be a little more labor intensive and
95:15 - a little more costly than the things
95:16 - you're going to do
95:18 - over the long term to get your business
95:20 - and that's all right again
95:22 - these things like i said while they in
95:24 - the short term while they may be costly
95:25 - while they may be time intensive the
95:27 - bottom line is they're necessary
95:29 - because if you don't have clients today
95:31 - you are not going to do that very well
95:34 - and you're not going to be around for
95:35 - very long so let's look at five things
95:38 - you can do in the short term to get
95:41 - clients for your startup business
95:43 - number one is simply gonna be people you
95:46 - know and i'll talk about this in a
95:48 - minute you're just gonna put put out
95:50 - there to people you know that you're now
95:51 - engaging in this kind of work
95:54 - number two is to be lead websites such
95:57 - as upwork and fiverr we'll talk about
95:59 - those in a minute number three is going
96:01 - to be leveraging your linkedin profile
96:04 - number four and people are surprised
96:06 - when i say this is going to be
96:07 - leveraging websites such as craigslist
96:09 - and number five is gonna be good
96:11 - old-fashioned networking so let's go
96:13 - through each of these in turn
96:15 - number one is as i said just putting
96:18 - your name out there to people you know
96:20 - you would be surprised at how much work
96:22 - you can get by simply making everyone
96:25 - you know aware of the fact that you are
96:27 - now engaging in this type of work i'm
96:30 - not suggesting that you go around the
96:32 - friends and family members and
96:34 - continuously harass them into letting
96:36 - you do build them a website or letting
96:38 - you do something for them what i'm
96:40 - saying though is that you need to simply
96:42 - put out there hey just so you know i'm
96:44 - available to do this type of work let me
96:47 - give you a few examples of what i mean
96:49 - by that in one of our businesses
96:52 - our main service is building websites
96:54 - for
96:56 - very small to medium-sized companies and
96:58 - usually you know kind of like the small
97:00 - mom-and-pop shops type companies
97:02 - so
97:03 - just as an example when we started that
97:06 - business i made i just kind of casually
97:08 - mentioned to one friend of mine hey just
97:10 - so you know we're going to be doing this
97:12 - type of work you know like etc etc
97:15 - if you know anybody that needs that kind
97:16 - of work just let me know and very
97:19 - quickly that friend said to me
97:21 - that her her mother had actually
97:23 - recently started a church and then we
97:24 - wound up building a website for the
97:26 - church i also mentioned to a neighbor
97:29 - that i was doing this type of work and
97:31 - very quickly that led to another
97:33 - referral the same thing and i had
97:35 - similar situations with other people
97:37 - that we knew
97:38 - so when i told people hey we do this
97:41 - kind of work that was going to be the
97:43 - only time i tell them i'm not going to
97:44 - like sit there and tell them over and
97:46 - over i'm not going to like harass them
97:48 - i'm not going to sit there and say just
97:49 - a reminder i do this kind of work just
97:51 - casually make people aware
97:53 - that you're doing this type of work and
97:55 - do it in a way where you don't sound
97:56 - like you're trying to sell them
97:57 - something again hey just letting you
97:59 - know and you will be surprised how
98:01 - quickly referrals can come in that way
98:04 - as i said we started that little side
98:05 - project business i just talked about and
98:07 - very quickly we started getting
98:08 - referrals simply by letting people i
98:10 - know
98:11 - know that we were doing this kind of
98:12 - work so just putting yourself out there
98:15 - like that can go a long way and i can't
98:17 - stress that enough as
98:19 - a place to start
98:20 - the second place to
98:23 - look for
98:24 - getting clients for your business is
98:26 - lead service websites such as upwork and
98:28 - fiverr what
98:30 - up work is it's a website where
98:33 - essentially people looking for services
98:36 - such as web development or software
98:37 - development will go on upwork
98:40 - state what it is they want and what
98:42 - they're willing to pay and then you can
98:43 - go online and bid on the job a lot of
98:46 - times you'll be
98:47 - bidding on work at a dollar amount for
98:50 - which is way less than what you would
98:51 - normally charge for this kind of work
98:53 - but again in the beginning it's
98:55 - work so you know it can generate some
98:57 - revenue for you while you're getting
98:59 - started
99:00 - the thing that i would say is important
99:02 - to do when you're using websites such as
99:06 - upwork from tac
99:08 - things of that nature is to make sure
99:11 - that your profile on the site is fully
99:13 - completed make sure you list all your
99:14 - experience include examples of your work
99:16 - and um things of that nature make sure
99:19 - make sure people review you on those
99:21 - sites after they're happy with your
99:23 - services all those kinds of things will
99:25 - make your bidding process
99:27 - more effective so
99:29 - the upside of these kinds of services is
99:32 - the fact that
99:33 - people go on there looking for the
99:35 - services you're providing so it makes
99:38 - finding a customer a lot easier the
99:40 - downside is again you're working for a
99:42 - reduced rate a lot of the time and
99:44 - you're also paying for the lead so it's
99:47 - not going to be the most profitable
99:48 - thing in the world but in the short term
99:49 - it is work to do and it is money to be
99:52 - made
99:52 - another option as i mentioned a second
99:54 - ago is fiverr fiverr works a little
99:56 - different than a website such as upwork
99:58 - what fiverr is is
100:00 - you essentially go online create a
100:02 - profile people can come to your profile
100:04 - and say what they're willing to pay and
100:06 - then
100:07 - fiverr will take a cut of that so
100:11 - again you're usually going to wind up
100:12 - working for reduced rates on a website
100:15 - such as fiber and on top of that you're
100:17 - paying a percentage to fiber so
100:20 - when you're looking at those kinds of
100:21 - things it's important to consider the
100:22 - reduced profitability weight against the
100:25 - fact that the customers are typically
100:27 - being or essentially i should say being
100:29 - brought to you so again pros and cons on
100:31 - those
100:32 - third thing on our list is leveraging
100:34 - linkedin it's really important to on
100:38 - your linkedin profile
100:39 - make sure that you are stating that you
100:42 - are a freelance developer that you work
100:43 - for yourself put the name of your
100:44 - business on there and make sure you list
100:46 - in your bio and in your bylines that you
100:49 - are available to do this kind of work on
100:51 - a freelance basis
100:52 - make sure you're including all your
100:54 - qualifications uh include examples of
100:56 - your work on your linkedin profile and
100:58 - there is such a shortage right now of
101:00 - software developers and web developers
101:03 - that you will be surprised at how many
101:04 - people will reach out to you and ask if
101:06 - you are available to
101:08 - do work for them so linkedin is a good
101:11 - way uh to get business again just as i
101:14 - said make sure your profile is filled
101:17 - out all the way on there
101:19 - number four and this is one that people
101:22 - kind of raise an eyebrow when i say it
101:24 - is to
101:25 - have a nice ad on your local craigslist
101:28 - section so for example if you live in
101:32 - name of city go on the name of city page
101:34 - for craigslist
101:36 - and you know under certain the services
101:38 - section you can put in that you are
101:41 - available to do web design or whatever
101:42 - kind of work it is you're doing
101:45 - don't just put up a quick craigslist
101:46 - post saying
101:48 - that hey i do this work call me at this
101:50 - number
101:51 - actually take the time write out a nice
101:54 - ad put it on craigslist include a
101:55 - graphic uh
101:57 - the craigslist supports a graphic uh at
101:59 - a width of 450 pixels at a height of 600
102:02 - pixels put a nice graphic on there
102:04 - put
102:05 - as i said a nice ad on there and you
102:08 - will be surprised at the fact that you
102:09 - get some calls through there
102:11 - to this day craigslist remains a
102:14 - highly valuable and highly underutilized
102:17 - resource for getting work
102:19 - now the work you're going to get through
102:20 - craigslist is not going to be the most
102:22 - profitable type of
102:24 - work there is these are typically going
102:26 - to be
102:27 - low dollar websites um you know people
102:30 - want to spend a few bucks for just some
102:32 - basic coding or something like that
102:34 - again it's not you're certainly not
102:36 - going to get rich off it's not going to
102:37 - be all the money in the world but it
102:38 - only costs you five dollars to run the
102:40 - ad and
102:41 - you will get some work out of that
102:44 - the important thing is to post
102:45 - consistently and to stick with it
102:48 - the last thing on our list
102:51 - is good old-fashioned networking and by
102:53 - networking i mean going out and meeting
102:56 - with other business owners to drum up
102:59 - work for yourself
103:01 - what i don't suggest for networking is
103:04 - going door-to-door or going around at
103:06 - different kinds of businesses trying to
103:08 - introduce yourself i also don't suggest
103:11 - going to functions that are mostly
103:13 - attended by other developers
103:16 - that is something i see in a lot of
103:17 - different professions so for example
103:19 - attorneys tend to network with other
103:21 - attorneys
103:22 - uh you know accountants tend to network
103:25 - with other accountants a lot of software
103:27 - developers tend to network with other
103:28 - software developers and to be honest
103:30 - that's just not a very effective way of
103:33 - leveraging networking into getting
103:35 - customers instead what you want to be
103:37 - doing is
103:39 - meeting with people who in turn work
103:41 - with your customers so for example if
103:44 - you are
103:46 - let's say
103:47 - starting up a freelance web design
103:48 - business and
103:50 - what you might want to do is get hooked
103:52 - up with a digital marketer who doesn't
103:54 - actually do web design but maybe manages
103:56 - pay-per-click or something for somebody
103:58 - those type of people are almost always
104:00 - looking for people to build websites on
104:02 - behalf of their clients so that would in
104:03 - turn be
104:05 - a good referral source for you
104:07 - one of the best ways
104:09 - or i should say best resources
104:12 - to
104:13 - find good networking opportunities is a
104:15 - group called bni that's business
104:16 - networking international they're
104:18 - throughout the united states and with
104:20 - lots of local chapters and pretty much
104:22 - everywhere so
104:24 - go on bni's website and find local
104:26 - chapters in your area and join up there
104:29 - is an annual fee for joining bni it is
104:31 - well worth it
104:33 - the idea of bni is
104:36 - has a few aspects to it number one
104:38 - is they only allow
104:41 - one person in a chapter per an area so
104:44 - for example if you join bni as a web
104:46 - designer they're not going to allow
104:48 - another web designer in that chapter so
104:51 - which a lot gives you some exclusivity
104:53 - and
104:54 - for obvious reasons is good for you
104:57 - and then you'll have a chapter with one
104:59 - web designer one auto mechanic one
105:01 - accountant one finance manager one
105:05 - local doctor just name that one real
105:08 - estate agent just name the type of
105:10 - business and he will have one of each in
105:11 - there and then once you attend it and
105:13 - then you'll attend weekly meetings and
105:15 - once you attend these weekly meetings
105:17 - the goal of bni is for
105:19 - everybody in the group to essentially
105:22 - open up their referral books to one
105:24 - another so in other words
105:26 - you are
105:28 - a web designer in the bni group
105:30 - friend of yours needs an auto mechanic
105:32 - you refer them to the auto mechanic in
105:34 - the bni group
105:36 - the auto mechanic nobody knows somebody
105:38 - who
105:39 - needs their house painted so he refers
105:41 - them to the house painter in the bni
105:44 - group it turns out that there's a
105:47 - doctor in the or
105:50 - you know physician in the bni group
105:53 - and
105:54 - it turns out he knows somebody that
105:55 - needs a website he just refers the site
105:59 - he refers them to you so in other words
106:02 - it's not something where
106:03 - person one and person two are directly
106:05 - referring things to each other all the
106:07 - time it's just that everybody in the
106:08 - group is referring things to other
106:10 - people in a group and a lot of that
106:12 - business will have a way of coming back
106:13 - to you
106:14 - so attending a networking group such as
106:16 - bni is a really good start for a way to
106:20 - get business in the short term
106:23 - networking can be very very time
106:25 - consuming so that is why i've got it on
106:28 - our list of things to do to build
106:29 - business in the short term it is a very
106:32 - time consuming so
106:33 - a lot of people like to say well i go
106:36 - out and i network because it's free well
106:38 - it's only free if you value your time at
106:40 - zero okay and your time is worth a whole
106:42 - lot more than zero so in the short term
106:45 - networking functions and networking
106:47 - events and joining networking groups is
106:49 - an okay way to get business but as you
106:51 - build a brand long term those are things
106:53 - that you're going to want to get away
106:54 - from
106:55 - so to sum up we're really talking about
106:58 - five ways
106:59 - to
107:00 - build business and grow your company
107:02 - over the short term
107:04 - number one is people you know as i said
107:07 - just put it out there that you're doing
107:08 - this kind of work you know uh don't
107:10 - harass your friends it's a good way to
107:12 - make sure they're not your friends
107:13 - anymore
107:14 - number two
107:15 - excuse me is using services such as
107:19 - upwork thumbtack and fiverr
107:21 - number three is leveraging linkedin
107:24 - number four is a website such as
107:26 - craigslist and number five is good
107:28 - old-fashioned networking so now that
107:31 - we've gone over all of those let's talk
107:33 - about how it is you're gonna build your
107:35 - brand over the long term which will
107:37 - greatly increase your profits
107:46 - okay let's talk about building your
107:47 - business over the long term now and
107:49 - having a long-term sustainable business
107:52 - is going to look a lot different than
107:54 - the things you're doing to get business
107:56 - in the short term
107:57 - as we talked about in the last section
107:58 - of our video your short-term business
108:00 - activities are really going to focus on
108:02 - using lead websites going to networking
108:04 - events things that are either very
108:06 - expensive things that are very time
108:08 - consuming things that lead to you taking
108:11 - work at reduced rates
108:13 - those are all good ways to make a few
108:15 - bucks today to keep your new business
108:17 - running and to help you make a little
108:19 - extra money while you're focusing on
108:21 - building a long-term brand
108:23 - the reason why building a long-term
108:25 - brand is so important is having an
108:28 - actual brand that you have ownership and
108:30 - control of allows you to number one
108:34 - charge more for your services you'll
108:36 - actually be charging more of what you
108:37 - deserve to be making for the work you're
108:39 - doing
108:40 - number two
108:41 - it also allows you to save time and
108:44 - resources on getting work in other words
108:47 - instead of you putting out money instead
108:49 - of you putting out a lot of time to get
108:51 - work people are going to be coming to
108:53 - you so think of it like this people
108:54 - coming to you and saying let me pay you
108:56 - full price as opposed to you going to
108:58 - people and saying
108:59 - here's uh reduced work i can do so for
109:03 - obvious reasons having a brand is way
109:06 - way way and a whole bunch of ways more
109:09 - profitable than the things you're going
109:11 - to need to do in the short term so while
109:14 - you're engaging in those short term
109:16 - activities
109:17 - that we talked about in the our last
109:20 - section i cannot stress enough that you
109:22 - need to be making time for the long term
109:24 - activities that were
109:26 - about to talk about and if you don't
109:29 - make time for those long-term activities
109:32 - next thing you know you've been
109:33 - freelancing and working for yourself for
109:35 - five years and you are still
109:37 - engaging in those short-term activities
109:39 - and not making very much money
109:41 - that can be a trap that is actually very
109:43 - easy for people to fall into so the best
109:46 - thing you can do is just set aside the
109:48 - time every week to say you know what i
109:50 - don't care how busy i am i'm going to
109:53 - focus on these
109:54 - long-term activities so what are the
109:57 - long-term activities that
110:00 - you're going to engage in to
110:02 - make sure you're building a brand and
110:03 - that you're charging more for your
110:04 - services and that you're not putting
110:06 - time and effort into
110:07 - getting customers number one is simply
110:10 - building a referral base and we'll talk
110:12 - about that in a second number two is
110:14 - going to be leveraging a blog for
110:16 - yourself and number three is going to be
110:18 - leveraging platforms such as youtube if
110:21 - you focus on these three things then
110:23 - next thing you know like i said people
110:24 - are coming to you instead of you going
110:26 - to them and people are paying you more
110:28 - instead of less
110:29 - so let's look at each of these in term
110:32 - again number one is simply getting
110:35 - referrals from people and getting repeat
110:37 - business referrals and repeat business
110:39 - i'm saying that so saying that so many
110:41 - times because it's so important it's so
110:42 - important i'm going to say it again
110:44 - referrals and repeat business
110:46 - here's the important thing to understand
110:48 - about getting referrals from former
110:50 - customers and having other former
110:52 - customers come back to you to do
110:53 - additional work in the future
110:57 - when you look at very successful
110:58 - businesses
111:00 - they don't get a proportionately higher
111:03 - number of phone calls and what i mean by
111:05 - that is let's say you've got developer
111:07 - one and developer two here's developer
111:09 - one here's developer two
111:12 - this developer does
111:15 - five times the revenue every year of
111:17 - this developer let's go with 5x that
111:20 - does not mean that this developer gets
111:23 - five times as many
111:24 - brand new client calls
111:26 - every month as this developer if you
111:29 - want to get to where you are making
111:31 - substantially more than other people you
111:34 - have to do it by
111:36 - getting referrals from former customers
111:38 - and getting repeat business from former
111:40 - customers it is simply too expensive and
111:42 - too time consuming to constantly be
111:45 - getting brand new business that's not
111:47 - stemming from work you have already done
111:49 - it's just not possible to succeed
111:51 - without doing that think of it in these
111:54 - terms
111:55 - a customer comes to you
111:58 - wants a website you build it for three
112:00 - thousand dollars right you do a really
112:02 - good job for that customer
112:04 - three to six months later that customer
112:07 - refers you to somebody
112:09 - you then build that person a website for
112:10 - twenty five hundred dollars
112:12 - three to six months later that second
112:15 - customer the referred one they refer you
112:17 - somebody
112:18 - you build that one
112:20 - website for say three thousand dollars
112:24 - your marketing or whatever you're doing
112:25 - to get clients from the outside world
112:28 - only yielded one phone call it yielded
112:30 - the phone call from the very first
112:31 - customer however by doing good work that
112:34 - one customer turned into three new
112:35 - customers or i'm sorry two new customers
112:37 - and a total of three customers
112:39 - and as a result of that you also have
112:42 - three potential referral sources out
112:44 - there right now all from one phone call
112:46 - right
112:47 - and some of that
112:48 - can also happen with repeat business and
112:51 - so on so forth in other words if you get
112:54 - one phone call you do a great job for
112:55 - the person and over the course of three
112:58 - or four years you know you do three or
112:59 - four different projects for that person
113:01 - one phone call yielded three or four
113:03 - different jobs essentially so
113:06 - that kind of an approach and focusing on
113:08 - referrals and repeat business is the way
113:11 - to grow your business exponentially
113:14 - so how do you make sure you're getting
113:15 - referrals and repeat business
113:18 - well it may sound simple but you'd be
113:19 - surprised the first thing is good
113:21 - old-fashioned customer service
113:23 - call people back
113:24 - return respond to people's emails
113:27 - be honest with them about how long
113:29 - something is going to take
113:31 - do what you're say you're going to do if
113:33 - you tell somebody you're going to have
113:35 - something done by thursday have it done
113:36 - by thursday if you're not going to have
113:38 - it done by thursday make sure you call
113:40 - them thursday and or email them thursday
113:43 - and explain to them that this isn't done
113:45 - i'm sorry here's why it's not done
113:47 - here's when it will be done don't make
113:49 - them chase you around saying hey you
113:51 - said this was going to be done on
113:52 - thursday where is it good old-fashioned
113:54 - customer service and saying
113:57 - that that what you're going to do and
113:59 - doing it
114:00 - are the most sure-fire ways to lead to
114:03 - that repeat business and those referrals
114:06 - that we just talked about i cannot
114:07 - stress this enough
114:09 - you may think duh when i'm saying
114:11 - provide good service to people but you
114:13 - would be surprised at
114:15 - how few people out there actually
114:17 - provide the kind of service that you
114:18 - would probably want to receive yourself
114:20 - so going that extra mile going above and
114:23 - beyond can really go a long way and as
114:27 - simple as that sounds
114:29 - it takes work to you got to remember it
114:30 - takes work to provide good customer
114:32 - service right so do that work and put in
114:34 - the time and you will be shocked at how
114:36 - fast your business grows um
114:38 - and this is true whatever industry
114:40 - you're in whether you're a freelance
114:41 - developer of some sort whether you're a
114:44 - real estate agent whether you are
114:46 - you know
114:47 - an accountant or some other type of
114:49 - professional i just cannot stress enough
114:51 - good service leads to a whole lot more
114:54 - business and that is how you grow your
114:56 - business exponentially through referrals
114:58 - and repeat business so that's number one
115:02 - number two for building your freelance
115:03 - business over the long term is
115:05 - leveraging a blog
115:07 - and by this i mean you need to be
115:09 - blogging regularly attach your blog to
115:11 - your website you need to be blogging
115:13 - regularly on issues important to your
115:15 - customer base
115:16 - one of the big mistakes a lot of people
115:18 - make with a blog is
115:20 - they start writing on things that they
115:22 - think are interesting
115:23 - the focus of your blog needs to be
115:24 - providing useful information to your
115:26 - customer base and this is something i
115:29 - see all the time
115:31 - like for example i have on our blog
115:34 - on our business for our business which
115:36 - deals primarily with software answers
115:38 - for law firms we have provided a lot of
115:40 - information about how law firms can be
115:43 - more efficient in their day-to-day
115:44 - operations we've written a lot of
115:46 - information about
115:49 - how they can leverage different software
115:51 - applications in a law firm and so on so
115:54 - forth
115:54 - attorneys doing google searches on
115:57 - making their practices more efficient
115:58 - then land on those articles and they
116:01 - explore our blog further
116:03 - when they start to look at some of the
116:04 - solutions we provide they realize that
116:06 - they may need our services and they pick
116:07 - up the phone and call us so in other
116:09 - words by providing useful information
116:12 - to our customer base through a blog our
116:15 - customer base lands on our website they
116:17 - then turn and they in turn then call us
116:20 - so leveraging a blog that provides
116:23 - useful information to your customers is
116:26 - one of the best ways to get business and
116:28 - this winds up being incredibly time
116:30 - effective there are blog posts that i
116:32 - wrote three four five even in some
116:34 - instances even six years ago that are
116:37 - still yield still yielding phone calls
116:39 - to our business today so in other words
116:41 - a couple hours to write a blog post five
116:44 - years ago
116:45 - people are still calling us because we
116:46 - own it no one can take it away from us
116:49 - okay that is incredibly time effective
116:51 - in terms of
116:52 - going out and getting a business
116:54 - in addition to a blog another great
116:56 - source to leverage is youtube uh youtube
116:58 - is one of the most popu actually one of
117:00 - the most popular search engines in the
117:01 - world people go on youtube all the time
117:03 - looking for information if you're gonna
117:05 - do a youtube channel to drum up business
117:08 - the thing i cannot stress enough is just
117:11 - like with a blog
117:12 - provide information that is useful to
117:14 - people so again provide information that
117:17 - your potential customers are looking for
117:20 - so for
117:21 - example let's say
117:23 - you want to focus on
117:25 - websites for small businesses
117:28 - which is something we do in one of our
117:30 - businesses i'm just using this as an
117:32 - example i want to build websites for
117:34 - small businesses i start a youtube
117:35 - channel on it
117:36 - a lot of small businesses might be
117:38 - trying to do their own website say with
117:40 - wix or like wordpress or something like
117:43 - that and then they'll get frustrated
117:45 - with it and
117:47 - maybe decide to call a developer
117:49 - so what we can do in our business is do
117:51 - a youtube channel on how to's like
117:53 - here's how to do x in your wix website
117:55 - here's how to do why in your wordpress
117:58 - website and then those
118:01 - small businesses
118:02 - start to use our youtube channel as a
118:04 - resource to meet their needs and over
118:06 - time when they realize that wix and
118:08 - wordpress actually can't meet their meet
118:10 - their needs fully or their needs go
118:11 - beyond wix or wordpress they then turn
118:14 - around and call us because we're the
118:15 - people they've been getting information
118:17 - from
118:17 - this whole time so again providing
118:19 - useful information to people is the best
118:23 - way to
118:24 - leverage a youtube channel so
118:27 - doing these three things i've just
118:28 - talked about
118:30 - really again i can't stress enough
118:31 - allows you to build a brand
118:33 - it results in people coming to you
118:35 - instead of you going out hustling up
118:36 - work and it allows you to charge more
118:38 - for your work
118:40 - so while you're growing your business in
118:42 - the short term and while you're doing
118:43 - the things you need to do to get clients
118:45 - in the short term the things you need to
118:47 - be focusing on
118:49 - is
118:50 - making sure you're building a referral
118:51 - base and a repeat business base and you
118:54 - do that by providing the absolute
118:55 - highest levels of customer service
118:58 - meeting your deadlines and doing the
118:59 - things you say you're going to do
119:01 - you want to leverage a blog
119:03 - again while you're busy in your business
119:04 - you need to make sure you're setting
119:06 - aside time to blog and that you're
119:08 - writing on issues that are answering
119:10 - your clients questions addressing your
119:12 - clients concerns and providing the kind
119:14 - of information your potential clients
119:16 - are looking for you want to apply that
119:18 - same approach to the third thing which
119:20 - is a youtube channel and again providing
119:22 - value and usefulness to people is the
119:24 - best way to make sure that
119:27 - they are
119:28 - excuse me that they are
119:30 - potentially interested in calling you
119:32 - if you do these three things
119:35 - you start to see yourself as i said
119:36 - having a brand
119:38 - that in turn leads to more leads to much
119:40 - more money it also leads to you having
119:41 - much more time because you're not doing
119:43 - things like going to networking events
119:44 - and
119:45 - the other things that you have to do to
119:46 - get business in the short term
119:49 - so with all of that said let's move on
119:51 - to the next part of our video which is
119:54 - how to go about managing your business
119:56 - on a day-to-day basis
120:06 - okay we're on to the part of our video
120:08 - where we're going to talk about managing
120:09 - your business on a day-to-day basis and
120:12 - we're going to break that down into two
120:14 - parts first we're going to talk about
120:17 - managing your administrative tasks on a
120:19 - day-to-day basis and by administrative
120:21 - tasks i mean anything that is not
120:23 - actually related to development
120:26 - things such as filing your businesses
120:28 - taxes doing your bookkeeping filing
120:30 - paperwork with your secretary of state
120:32 - so on so forth so managing those kinds
120:34 - of tasks and the second thing we'll talk
120:36 - about
120:38 - will be managing your substantive work
120:39 - on a day-to-day basis and your
120:41 - substantive work is the actual
120:43 - development work and you want to make
120:44 - sure you're doing that in a way
120:46 - that yields as much profit as possible
120:48 - so we'll talk about administrative and
120:50 - substantive and how to make sure you're
120:52 - managing yourself now before we get into
120:55 - those two things the biggest point i
120:57 - want to stress is that it's time for you
120:59 - to start thinking of yourself as a
121:00 - business person it's really common for
121:03 - me to have conversations with
121:05 - self-employed individuals who will say
121:07 - something like well i'm not a business
121:09 - person i'm a software developer or i'm
121:12 - not a business person i'm a real estate
121:15 - agent or i'm not a business person i'm
121:16 - an attorney or something like that
121:19 - once you start working for yourself if
121:22 - you take the attitude of
121:24 - you know i'm not a business person i'm
121:26 - an ex
121:28 - then you really don't need to worry
121:29 - about being a business person and i say
121:31 - that because you're going to be out of
121:32 - business so fast that the problem of
121:34 - being a business person will take care
121:35 - of itself
121:37 - and when i say that i don't mean it to
121:39 - sound to flip but
121:42 - it really is true and the people who
121:45 - succeed as freelance developers and
121:48 - essentially and eventually i should say
121:50 - grow their freelance business into a
121:52 - real business are the ones who
121:53 - understand that
121:55 - as soon as you strike out on your own
121:56 - whether you have one customer whether
121:58 - you're running microsoft you are now in
122:00 - business for yourself
122:02 - okay so you need to understand that
122:05 - things like working efficiently and
122:06 - dealing with your administrative tasks
122:08 - those aren't optional these are things
122:10 - you're going to have to do and you just
122:12 - don't have a choice in the matter
122:13 - anymore and that is a choice you made
122:15 - once you decided to strike out on your
122:17 - own so understand that you are a
122:19 - business person doing so will one
122:21 - allow you to stay in business and to
122:24 - allow you to make a lot more money so
122:26 - with all that said let's move on to how
122:28 - to manage your administrative affairs on
122:30 - a day-to-day basis
122:39 - okay so we're going to talk about the
122:40 - importance of dealing with your
122:41 - business's administrative affairs on a
122:44 - day-to-day basis and the reason i am
122:47 - talking about this first
122:49 - before i get into talking about how to
122:51 - manage your substantive work is that the
122:55 - administrative work is a crucial topic
122:57 - to
122:58 - address lots and lots and lots and a
123:01 - whole bunch of lots of businesses
123:03 - especially freelance developers get
123:06 - themselves in trouble
123:07 - not because they're bad at development
123:09 - or they service their customers poorly
123:11 - it's because they do a really bad job at
123:13 - their administrative work and then that
123:14 - creates problems down the road for
123:17 - example suppose
123:19 - just as a hypothetical you need to file
123:21 - a document with the secretary of state
123:23 - and you fail to do so and you're right
123:26 - in the middle of a coding project for
123:28 - somebody and because you didn't file
123:30 - that document to secretary of state six
123:32 - months later while you're in the middle
123:33 - of that coding project
123:35 - a notice shows up from the secretary of
123:37 - state saying you've lost your right to
123:39 - legally do business so now you need to
123:41 - put that coding project on hold
123:44 - and take a day or two to deal with uh
123:47 - your administrative snafu
123:49 - as a result of this you miss a deadline
123:51 - to the customer the customer is unhappy
123:54 - uh you know obviously the customer is
123:55 - never going to refer you anybody the
123:57 - customer is never going to uh you know
124:00 - come back to you again for more work and
124:03 - that's just a simple example of how not
124:05 - dealing with administrative tasks can
124:08 - get in the way of you doing your
124:10 - substantive work and i totally
124:13 - understand
124:14 - that it's not fun to do administrative
124:17 - tasks right it's not fun to
124:19 - you know fill out stuff for the
124:20 - secretary of state it's not fun to do
124:22 - your bookkeeping it's not fun to do
124:24 - those kinds of things that's not why you
124:26 - signed up for free code camp that's not
124:28 - why you became a software developer in
124:30 - the first place but unfortunately those
124:32 - things are part of the job and if you
124:34 - don't pay attention to them
124:37 - failing to complete those administrative
124:38 - tasks timely and to handle them
124:40 - correctly
124:41 - will lead to problems with your actual
124:43 - substantive business okay so this is why
124:46 - i'm talking about the administrative
124:48 - tasks first
124:50 - so
124:50 - the first administrative issue i'm going
124:52 - to talk about
124:54 - in the management of your business is
124:56 - the biggest one and that's your
124:58 - day-to-day financial management
125:00 - i could do easily a very long video
125:03 - course on how to manage your freelance
125:06 - business from a financial standpoint
125:09 - and
125:10 - because it would be so long i'm not
125:11 - going to dive into all of it now what
125:13 - i'm going to do is suggest you read a
125:15 - book which i suggested earlier in this
125:17 - course and that book is called profit
125:19 - first what profit first does
125:22 - is it lays out a framework which can
125:25 - manage your businesses finances for you
125:27 - so in other words it puts a framework in
125:28 - place you follow the framework and your
125:32 - business's finances kind of manage
125:34 - themselves at that point
125:36 - and financial management is one of the
125:39 - biggest things where a lot of people get
125:41 - themselves into trouble one of the
125:43 - biggest things you want to avoid is
125:45 - what's called bank balance accounting
125:47 - and lots of small business owners are
125:49 - guilty of this where they go online they
125:51 - look at their bank account they see a
125:53 - balance you know on the screen and they
125:55 - just assume that's that's how much money
125:57 - they have without any thought of you
125:59 - know what they've got to be paying
126:00 - what's coming out of it and
126:02 - so on so forth following the
126:05 - methodology laid out in profit first can
126:08 - a help you avoid bank balance accounting
126:10 - but also just help you make sure that
126:12 - your business is staying on
126:15 - path
126:16 - and in addition to reading profit first
126:20 - just remember that your businesses bank
126:22 - account is not your personal bank
126:24 - account you just can't go rate it
126:25 - whenever you want some money what you
126:27 - want to do is set up a system where
126:30 - you're only allowed to take a certain
126:31 - amount of money out of the business at
126:33 - any given time and a certain amount of
126:35 - money has to stay in the business at a
126:37 - given time and the profit first book
126:39 - really does a good job of laying all
126:41 - that out for you so if you can avoid
126:43 - financial mismanagement you will avoid a
126:46 - lot of the problems that or i should say
126:49 - administrative problems that get
126:51 - freelance developers into trouble and
126:54 - what i would suggest to you as an easy
126:55 - to use method for making sure you
126:59 - are following good financial management
127:00 - habits
127:01 - for your business is to read profit
127:03 - first and follow it again it's not
127:05 - enough to read the book you actually
127:06 - have to follow
127:08 - the methodology it's laying out for you
127:12 - the second big part in addition to
127:15 - following a methodology like the one in
127:17 - profit first to making sure that your
127:19 - finances are managed properly is to do
127:22 - your accounting regularly this is so
127:24 - important i cannot stress it enough do
127:26 - your accounting regularly you should be
127:28 - using bookkeeping software like wave or
127:30 - quickbooks or something of the sort in
127:32 - our business we use wave
127:35 - and i see way way way way way too many
127:38 - small businesses that don't do their
127:41 - books until the end of the year or even
127:43 - worse at the end of the year
127:45 - they essentially just print off all
127:46 - their bank statements and dump it on an
127:48 - accountant and say okay here figure out
127:50 - how much money i made last year well
127:53 - not doing the books in your business on
127:55 - a regular basis
127:57 - means you never actually know
127:59 - if you're making money or not and if you
128:01 - are making money how much you're making
128:02 - and if you're losing money how much
128:04 - you're losing and then it becomes easy
128:06 - for you to think well it seems like i'm
128:07 - doing good
128:09 - well seem can be a very tricky thing and
128:11 - you can get yourself in a lot of trouble
128:13 - by going off of how things seem what you
128:16 - need is objective data in front of you
128:17 - in other words you need a monthly
128:19 - statement showing here's how much money
128:21 - my business took in here's how much went
128:23 - out here's how much i've made here's how
128:25 - much i lost you've got to do your books
128:28 - on a regular basis
128:29 - if you get up and
128:32 - the first thing every day before you
128:34 - start work just do your bookkeeping for
128:36 - the day before in other words download
128:38 - the prior days transactions and
128:40 - reconcile them in your accounting
128:42 - software then you get in the habit of
128:44 - doing that and your books are just done
128:46 - all the time and it doesn't take more
128:47 - than a few minutes a day when you're
128:49 - just starting out if you have very few
128:51 - transactions at a minimum do your books
128:53 - once a week or at worst once a month but
128:56 - do your books on a regular basis i
128:58 - cannot stress this enough that is the
129:00 - only way you're actually going to know
129:02 - how much money you're making or how much
129:03 - money you're losing and what you need to
129:06 - adjust another benefit of doing your
129:08 - books on a regular basis is it also
129:09 - helps you catch expenses you might not
129:11 - realize you've signed up for that you're
129:12 - still paying so
129:14 - do your books regularly so in terms of
129:16 - managing your finances
129:18 - read profit first
129:20 - follow the methods laid out in profit
129:23 - first
129:24 - avoid using your personal bank account
129:26 - or i'm sorry your business's bank
129:28 - account as a piggy bank you can't just
129:30 - rate it whenever you want
129:33 - and the fourth part of managing your
129:35 - finances is doing your books daily
129:37 - so that's keeping your finances in order
129:39 - which again is one of the biggest
129:40 - administrative problems that
129:43 - a lot of freelancers run into
129:45 - and in terms of the second aspect of
129:49 - your administrative problems or
129:51 - administrative tasks i should say that
129:53 - you've got to manage on a day-to-day
129:54 - basis
129:56 - that is just really all the different
129:58 - things that come with being a small
129:59 - business person too having to file your
130:02 - business license every year if you're in
130:03 - a state that requires that two having to
130:06 - file any documentation you need to file
130:09 - with
130:10 - county sales tax boards let's say you'll
130:12 - find that as an entrepreneur there is an
130:16 - endless flow of paperwork that you need
130:18 - to fill out and you need to stay on top
130:20 - of it so the best thing to do is don't
130:24 - take the approach of i'll do this later
130:27 - when a piece of paper comes across your
130:28 - desk and you look at it and you say oh
130:31 - okay i have to file something with the
130:33 - secretary of state just deal with it on
130:36 - the spot don't let these things pile up
130:39 - okay letting these kinds of tasks pile
130:41 - up is another of the big mistakes i see
130:44 - from entrepreneurs and again they might
130:47 - find out they've lost the ability to do
130:48 - business legally because they've let
130:50 - these things pile up if you just deal
130:52 - with them as soon as they come up
130:54 - then they're done you don't have to
130:56 - worry about them they're
130:57 - just taken care of and they probably
130:59 - don't even take that long
131:00 - what takes a long time is when you let
131:02 - these things grow into a stack this high
131:04 - and then you have to stop everything
131:05 - you're doing and spend days if not weeks
131:07 - dealing with all that stuff so deal with
131:09 - your administrative tasks as they come
131:12 - up just treat them as a priority that
131:13 - has to be dealt with
131:15 - because by getting them out of the way
131:17 - you can focus on the substantive work
131:19 - more okay so deal with those things
131:22 - immediately after they arise that is
131:25 - just something it is so important
131:27 - and if you do that you will have an
131:29 - advantage over other freelancers so in
131:32 - short if you want to get a leg up
131:35 - in your new business you got you have to
131:37 - take your administrative test seriously
131:40 - you have to manage your finances
131:41 - appropriately which cut which entails
131:43 - everything we just talked about reading
131:45 - profit first following the methods in it
131:48 - not rating your bank account doing your
131:50 - books on a regular basis and you have to
131:52 - deal with your administrative tasks as
131:54 - soon as they come up and if you need
131:56 - help with them
131:57 - retain a business lawyer to help you
131:59 - okay but if you do those things you
132:02 - prevent your administrative tasks from
132:04 - getting in the way of your actual
132:06 - business and then you make more money
132:08 - so with all that said let's get on to
132:10 - our accounting and financial management
132:12 - course from aaron lear of kpi
132:14 - bookkeeping
132:16 - hey code campers my name is aaron lair
132:18 - i'm the owner of kpi bookkeeping and
132:20 - consulting and i'm excited to go over
132:22 - with you today how to manage your
132:23 - finances as a freelancer i know this
132:26 - isn't everyone's most exciting or
132:28 - favorite topic but it is so important if
132:30 - you can get off on the right step and
132:32 - create good habits you'll be so much
132:34 - more ahead of other freelancers as well
132:36 - as business owners because you will know
132:38 - your income your expenses you'll know
132:40 - how to manage them and you'll know what
132:42 - decisions to make and what changes to
132:45 - make within your freelancing business so
132:48 - i'm going to divide this up into three
132:50 - topics uh this first one's just going to
132:51 - be the real basics 101 second topic
132:54 - we're going to do a brief overview of
132:56 - your chart of accounts or your income
132:58 - and expense buckets and once you get
133:00 - inside your accounting software and then
133:03 - the third topic we're going to cover a
133:04 - profit and loss statement just kind of
133:06 - how to read it and what it looks like
133:08 - all right i hope you find this helpful
133:10 - and best of luck thanks
133:17 - okay so if there are just three things
133:20 - to do if you don't want to watch
133:21 - anything else past this just three
133:23 - things
133:24 - is number one keep your business and
133:27 - personal finances separate number two
133:30 - save at least 25 30 of your gross income
133:33 - and number three have an accounting
133:35 - software and actually use it
133:38 - so let's get back to number one um
133:41 - keeping your business finances separate
133:43 - um from your personal
133:45 - so this one is
133:47 - just if there's one thing you do just at
133:49 - least do this one this is huge it'll
133:51 - save you so much time so much of a
133:53 - headache and money when it comes to
133:55 - getting your taxes done
133:57 - and it's as simple as when you're ready
133:59 - to start freelancing go open your own
134:01 - business bank account checking business
134:04 - checking account and savings account
134:07 - and any
134:08 - business transactions you occur those
134:10 - all need to come out of that business
134:12 - account as well as if you need to get a
134:13 - credit card open a credit card just for
134:16 - your business expenses
134:17 - and then keep all of your personal
134:19 - expenses separate just like the way
134:20 - you've had them running through your own
134:22 - personal accounts
134:24 - this will be huge when it comes to tax
134:26 - time and you'll be able to separate the
134:28 - differences between your freelancing and
134:31 - business activities versus your personal
134:33 - activities
134:35 - number two
134:37 - save 25 to 30 percent of your gross
134:39 - income for taxes
134:41 - i know that sounds like a lot i know it
134:43 - sounds crazy but it's definitely
134:46 - something you need to do
134:48 - and i also think you really need to
134:49 - factor this in when you start to
134:53 - give quotes and create your pricing
134:55 - structures
134:57 - the government wants right off the bat
135:00 - 15.3 percent for self-employment tax now
135:03 - that other 10 to 15 percent is just on
135:06 - the other income you receive
135:09 - so
135:10 - this is why you want to set up that
135:12 - savings account so as you get your
135:13 - business income coming into your
135:15 - business checking account i would say
135:17 - immediately or at least once a week take
135:19 - that income take that percentage of 25
135:22 - to 30 percent and then dump that right
135:24 - into your savings account so you're into
135:27 - your business savings account so that is
135:30 - stored away tucked away for taxes
135:33 - and then when tax time comes there's no
135:35 - big surprises you've got the money
135:38 - you're good to go
135:39 - um so that is huge i think this one
135:42 - surprises a lot of people a lot of
135:43 - freelancers they don't realize how high
135:45 - self-employment taxes and how much taxes
135:48 - will be taken out so do keep that in
135:50 - mind when you go to price when you
135:52 - create pricing structures
135:54 - and then number three have a accounting
135:56 - software and actually use it so i get a
135:59 - lot of clients that have accounting
136:00 - softwares they have things maybe synced
136:02 - up but they're not necessarily using it
136:05 - and i understand you get busy and if you
136:07 - can't use it or you don't know how then
136:09 - then reach out and get some help with it
136:11 - but when you go to select an accounting
136:14 - software
136:15 - i would get three major things one it
136:18 - can connect to your bank accounts and
136:19 - credit cards so these are typically
136:21 - gonna all be your cloud-based accounting
136:23 - um accounting software programs number
136:25 - two you can send your invoices from that
136:28 - platform or software whichever you
136:30 - choose
136:31 - and it has a pay now feature this will
136:33 - save you so much time and hassle as far
136:35 - as tracking your your invoices and then
136:38 - number two is you can pull a profitable
136:40 - loss report at minimum and profit law
136:42 - support ideally you'd like to be able to
136:44 - pull a balance sheet and a cash flow
136:46 - statement but you at least want to be
136:47 - able to pull a profit and loss report
136:50 - okay so let's move on to
136:53 - some accounting softwares
136:55 - um
136:55 - these are just a list of probably my top
136:57 - four
136:59 - the first two wave and freshbooks these
137:02 - are great for if you're just starting
137:03 - out they're
137:04 - very user friendly they've got a great
137:06 - interface on them um
137:09 - they're for the most part pretty
137:10 - intuitive i'm going to go over a little
137:12 - bit of things you need to to keep your
137:14 - eye on on the next video but these are
137:16 - great to just get started
137:19 - that you can invoice from them
137:21 - you can receive payments it'll track you
137:23 - can connect all your bank accounts and
137:26 - credit cards so these are great starters
137:29 - now if you
137:31 - you know let's say you want something
137:32 - you just want to stick with one and you
137:34 - want something that can grow with you
137:36 - those next two would be quickbooks
137:37 - online and xero
137:40 - these are great for more full-on
137:41 - businesses i mean you can still use them
137:44 - as a freelancer
137:45 - um these are more robust there's a lot
137:48 - more kind of going behind the scenes and
137:50 - i would say if you're just starting out
137:52 - they might have a little more too many
137:53 - more bells and whistles than you might
137:55 - need but that doesn't mean you can't use
137:57 - them you can still certainly use them
137:58 - you might want to get some training on
138:00 - those and even if you feel like you need
138:01 - to get training on the other two wave
138:03 - and fresh books i would definitely
138:05 - reach out and look for those
138:08 - but going back to quickbooks and xero
138:10 - these are great but again these will
138:12 - grow with you so you might not need
138:14 - these starting out you can certainly
138:15 - start in them but they're
138:17 - they will grow once you start having
138:19 - employees and you've got a lot more
138:21 - going on within your
138:22 - finances so this is just a brief
138:25 - overview um the next step or the next
138:27 - video we're going to get into is i'm
138:28 - going to kind of get into
138:30 - once you're in your accounting software
138:32 - what you really need to do and what you
138:34 - need to watch out for all right
138:36 - thanks
138:38 - let's move into your accounting software
138:40 - so you know how to get paid faster you
138:42 - know how to manage your receipts
138:44 - let's move into that accounting software
138:46 - and kind of get an idea of what we're
138:48 - looking at and what we're dealing with
138:50 - so just a warning this is a brief
138:53 - overview this is not going i'm not
138:55 - getting into any particular software so
138:59 - i do want to advise you that if you have
139:01 - questions
139:02 - reach out get help or get training from
139:05 - someone or take a course if you feel
139:07 - like you need to kind of get a better
139:09 - grip on this because if you start this
139:11 - out right it'll be much easier for you
139:13 - in the long run okay let's get started
139:16 - so
139:17 - what we're looking at right here is
139:19 - what's called a chart of accounts i'm
139:21 - going to just refer to these as income
139:22 - and expense buckets
139:24 - but these are chart of accounts
139:27 - a lot of these are going to be
139:28 - pre-loaded in your accounting software
139:32 - i will attach a pdf of this into
139:36 - this program but i want you to take a
139:39 - good look at the types so
139:42 - we've got income you can call this
139:45 - income or client
139:47 - sales or services that's going to be a
139:49 - revenue type any kind of expenses such
139:52 - as insurance or office supplies or rent
139:55 - those are all going to be expenses
139:58 - so as i said these will be already
140:01 - most of these a lot of some of them will
140:03 - be loaded in your accounting software
140:05 - you can change the names of them you can
140:08 - add more to them but as you start to do
140:12 - that
140:12 - use this as a guide as to what kind of
140:16 - type what
140:18 - one put a name on it whatever name you
140:20 - want and then you're going to use the
140:21 - type of account it's going to be
140:24 - and you can put it you can put a
140:25 - description in it's not a have to but
140:27 - this is very important because this type
140:29 - is going to tie to all your reports
140:32 - so depending on the type that will tie
140:34 - to your whether it falls on the p l the
140:37 - profit and loss report the balance sheet
140:41 - or the cash flow statement most of the
140:42 - time they're either going to just fall
140:44 - on the profit and loss or the balance
140:45 - sheet
140:47 - um so
140:49 - these are general expenses this is
140:51 - revenue
140:52 - um
140:53 - let's go to this next page okay so right
140:56 - here on owner's contribution or owner's
140:59 - pay
141:01 - this is labeled as equity this type is
141:03 - called equity and the reason for that is
141:05 - because this is not an income event so
141:08 - if you were to add money which would be
141:10 - owner's contribution add money into your
141:12 - business account
141:14 - that would be considered you're adding
141:16 - equity into your account if you were to
141:18 - take money out
141:20 - or to pay for any kind of personal
141:22 - expenses from your business account i
141:24 - don't recommend doing that on a daily
141:26 - basis or on a regular basis but if you
141:29 - made a slip up and you accidentally had
141:32 - an amazon account that got charged to
141:34 - your business account but it was a
141:36 - personal
141:38 - amazon purchase you could take that
141:40 - amount and code it to personal expenses
141:43 - or owner's pay
141:45 - um
141:46 - and those would not be that would not be
141:48 - considered an expense because you're
141:50 - it's the equity out of out of the money
141:53 - out of your business account
141:56 - these others right here some of these
141:58 - are kind of accounts that are working in
142:00 - the background so as you put in an
142:02 - invoice
142:04 - that accounting software is
142:05 - automatically going to code that invoice
142:07 - under the type accounts receivable
142:10 - because you're waiting for that money to
142:11 - come in you're waiting for it to be
142:13 - received to you
142:15 - accounts payable any kind of bills you
142:17 - owe if you go in and put a bill in but
142:19 - you haven't paid it yet and this isn't a
142:22 - necessary way of doing this you can
142:23 - certainly do it that way
142:25 - it definitely helps with your cash flow
142:27 - but if you're just paying your expenses
142:30 - as they come that's fine too but if you
142:32 - do decide to put your bills in
142:34 - and then pay later that would be an
142:36 - accounts payable
142:38 - and that will be labeled as accounts
142:40 - payable and that kind of automatically
142:41 - happens in the background of your
142:43 - accounting system
142:45 - um if you have any loans that's going to
142:47 - be a liability
142:49 - any taxes now taxes can be
142:51 - both a liability or an expense that's
142:54 - something you probably need to talk to
142:55 - your accountant to as far as how you're
142:57 - managing your filing and when you're
142:59 - filing your taxes that makes a big
143:01 - difference any large pieces of equipment
143:04 - are going to be considered assets
143:08 - and then retained earnings so retained
143:10 - earnings is any money that you
143:13 - made from the previous year so let's say
143:14 - at the end of your p l
143:16 - you had a positive of ten thousand
143:18 - dollars
143:19 - on december 31st of 2018 so come january
143:23 - 1st of 2019 that 10 000 is now going to
143:26 - move into retained earnings and now that
143:29 - p l will essentially start at zero
143:34 - so again use this as a guide um i will
143:37 - have a pdf of this and when you get into
143:39 - your
143:40 - your accounting software you're going to
143:42 - want to create these buckets or name
143:45 - them and like i said a lot of them will
143:46 - already be present
143:48 - um
143:50 - but use this as a guide to make sure
143:51 - you've got the right type so then your
143:53 - reports
143:55 - are correct as well
143:56 - okay um i have a weekly checklist a
143:59 - monthly checklist
144:01 - and a quarterly checklist so weekly you
144:03 - want to review your outstanding invoices
144:05 - and make any follow-up calls as needed
144:08 - you want to make sure you're organizing
144:09 - your receipts sort your bank
144:10 - transactions in your within your
144:12 - accounting software that's
144:14 - taking all those
144:17 - income and expenses and sorting them
144:18 - into those buckets we just talked about
144:21 - pay any bills and don't forget to pay
144:23 - yourself
144:24 - you can pay yourself monthly if you want
144:26 - to do it that way weekly if you have a
144:28 - good client flow it's not bad to pay
144:30 - yourself weekly because it kind of just
144:32 - helps you stay on track and helps you
144:33 - know your cash flow a little better
144:36 - monthly you want to reconcile your bank
144:38 - and credit cards this is so important i
144:41 - could create a whole other video on this
144:43 - i'm not going to
144:44 - but i suggest you really look into doing
144:46 - this is reconciling those banking credit
144:48 - card accounts against your bank
144:50 - statements and your credit card
144:51 - statements is like a big double check of
144:53 - what's going on within your accounting
144:55 - programs
144:56 - um review your profit and loss review
144:59 - your income i'm sorry review your
145:01 - expenses and subscriptions
145:04 - sub
145:05 - subscription creep is real i've seen it
145:08 - a lot so make sure you stay on top of
145:10 - those subscriptions and
145:12 - you know what you're using and ditch any
145:14 - of the ones you are not using
145:16 - and then after you review all that get a
145:18 - good idea of your cash flow once you
145:20 - kind of get a good grip of your expenses
145:22 - you'll really start to know what your
145:24 - cash flow situation will be like as well
145:26 - as staying on top of those invoices any
145:29 - overpaid invoices
145:31 - so quarterly you want to make sure you
145:33 - pay your quarterly taxes you want to
145:36 - review those pricing structures
145:39 - and then
145:40 - another one that i have not mentioned
145:42 - that's pretty important is
145:44 - make sure all your clients have a w-9
145:46 - from you so any client that you pay or
145:50 - i'm sorry that you invoice over six
145:51 - hundred dollars they should be
145:53 - requesting a double knight excuse me a
145:56 - w-9 from you
145:58 - um
145:59 - if they do not be prepared they may be
146:01 - requesting it around mid to in january
146:04 - that's when we have to file those w9 so
146:06 - keep that in mind if
146:08 - on my next point if you
146:11 - ask for any help or you get any 1099
146:13 - contractors to help you out you need to
146:15 - ask them for a w-9 and it's just a
146:18 - one-sheet
146:19 - irs document
146:21 - that basically just says you're an
146:23 - independent contractor
146:25 - um you can look it up google w9 and it's
146:27 - one of the first two or three things to
146:29 - pop up in google um
146:31 - you need that as well and you as if you
146:35 - hire any 1099 contractors you need to
146:38 - make sure you file those typically it's
146:40 - the last week of january i'm not going
146:42 - to be a specific date because the dates
146:43 - change every year
146:45 - around the last five days of january
146:48 - those need to be filed they're very easy
146:49 - to file it's 1099 filings is what
146:52 - they're called um
146:54 - so be prepared you're going to get asked
146:56 - that from your clients and if you happen
146:58 - to need to get any help with coding or
147:01 - design work for a client that you're
147:03 - working on you you need to make sure
147:05 - they hand you a w-9 as well
147:08 - all right that should wrap up your
147:10 - checklist let's dive into the p l
147:13 - all right you've made it we're not at
147:15 - our last video
147:16 - um so i'm going to talk about the profit
147:18 - and loss on this one and hopefully this
147:20 - will kind of wrap up everything and help
147:22 - you understand why it's important to do
147:25 - good financials and really pay attention
147:28 - to those income and expense buckets okay
147:30 - so let's get started
147:33 - okay so as you'll see on the left there
147:35 - is a profit and loss example of a profit
147:37 - loss statement
147:38 - i have blocked out the names any dates
147:40 - anything that could possibly reveal
147:41 - whose profit and loss this is
147:45 - so let me just start off with saying why
147:47 - you want to run a profit and loss
147:50 - i think we all want to do what we love
147:53 - doing and i'm assuming you love being
147:55 - coders but i also think we all need to
147:57 - know how much money we're making
147:59 - and a profit and loss is going to tell
148:01 - you that it's going to take your income
148:03 - minus all your expenses and then tell
148:05 - you what is left over
148:07 - and the more you focus on this
148:10 - the more you're going to be able to
148:11 - realize
148:12 - what changes you need to make maybe what
148:14 - kind of pivots you need to make with
148:16 - pricing maybe where you can cut back on
148:18 - expenses where you could actually add
148:20 - more in expenses so
148:23 - a profit loss is very important in terms
148:25 - of giving you a snapshot of where you
148:28 - are and you can pull a profit and loss
148:29 - on a weekly basis on a monthly basis
148:31 - quarterly yearly
148:33 - it'll just tell you exactly how much
148:35 - money you've brought in and how much
148:36 - you've brought out
148:37 - this will help with cash flow i'm not
148:39 - going to tell you this is the best
148:41 - report i'm going to tell you that a cash
148:42 - flow statement is a best report for cash
148:44 - flow but for just getting started this
148:47 - will give you an idea at least on your
148:49 - expenses what you could expect each
148:51 - month or even each week
148:54 - so this is why it's important to have an
148:56 - accounting software that will provide a
148:58 - profit and loss statement for you
149:00 - i also suggest in terms of getting
149:02 - overall health of your business and
149:04 - trying to make business decisions just
149:06 - is pulling a balance sheet and a cash
149:09 - flow statement and if you don't
149:10 - understand those to have someone help
149:12 - you understand those and make uh
149:15 - decisions moving forward
149:17 - anyway that's my soapbox let's get
149:19 - started on the profit and loss so profit
149:21 - loss you're going to have top line is
149:23 - going to be on your income you might
149:25 - have different income
149:27 - types client services client design work
149:30 - client code work however you want to do
149:32 - that but
149:34 - that is going to go back to those
149:36 - revenue buckets so that's why back in
149:38 - the other video when i talked about the
149:39 - buckets that's what's forming this p l
149:42 - in the background okay
149:44 - so you're gonna see revenue
149:46 - slash income and expenses so that's why
149:49 - that's important to make sure those
149:50 - types
149:51 - back on the previous video are correct
149:54 - so all of that information lands on the
149:56 - right report
149:57 - okay so you've got your income
150:00 - cost of goods and i'll get to this in
150:02 - just a minute and then your general
150:03 - business expenses so cost of goods is
150:06 - going to be
150:08 - if you have any kind of product that you
150:10 - have to purchase and then you
150:13 - sell that product to your client that is
150:15 - going to be your cost of goods sold i
150:18 - don't think most of you will incur any
150:20 - of this if you're just doing
150:21 - service-based business you're producing
150:24 - websites and
150:25 - codes and apps and things like that you
150:28 - really shouldn't have any cost of goods
150:30 - but that's just what that is here for
150:32 - um
150:34 - so you'll have top line income cost of
150:36 - goods and now you have a gross profit
150:38 - and then from that gross profit these
150:40 - are going to be your general expenses
150:42 - your rent your phone your internet your
150:45 - insurance anything that you incur on a
150:47 - regular basis or any kind of business
150:49 - doesn't have to be regular basis any
150:50 - kind of business expense
150:52 - and then that at the bottom that will
150:54 - give you your net operating income so
150:55 - this is going to tell you this 8 000
150:59 - and 99.38 is going to tell you how much
151:02 - money you brought in in that given time
151:04 - period whatever given time period you
151:06 - selected
151:08 - okay so
151:10 - profit and loss statement should only
151:12 - have your business related expenses
151:14 - income and expenses
151:15 - um
151:18 - in terms of what it should not have i'm
151:20 - going to jump back to that interest
151:21 - expense in just a minute but i'll go
151:23 - ahead and i'm going to go ahead and jump
151:25 - to the loan payment first so if you have
151:28 - a loan
151:30 - a loan payment is a little interesting
151:31 - in the fact that you have to have you
151:33 - kind of have to split that payment and
151:35 - you put the principal amount to a
151:36 - liability account and the interest
151:39 - amount can be on an expense account and
151:41 - you can see that loan interest amount on
151:43 - the profit and loss but the principal
151:45 - amount
151:47 - is on the balance sheet
151:49 - i know that's a little confusing if you
151:51 - have any loans i would suggest getting
151:53 - help setting that up once you get it set
151:55 - up it's not that hard to manage but
151:56 - that's just something that i see a lot
151:58 - of mistakes made so bottom line is don't
152:00 - put the entire loan amount on the profit
152:02 - and loss statement it is not an expense
152:06 - it's kind of a mix of an expense and a
152:07 - liability i'll leave it at that for now
152:10 - i don't want to get too far in the weeds
152:11 - with that um
152:13 - profit laws should not have your owner's
152:15 - pay so again this goes back to that
152:16 - previous video about how the owners pay
152:19 - is equity anything equity related will
152:21 - be on a balance sheet so if you want to
152:23 - pull up your running owner's payout or
152:26 - running owner's contribution you will
152:28 - find that on your balance sheet as long
152:30 - as it's coded to equity
152:32 - mileage is not on a p l i get that
152:34 - question asked quite a bit
152:36 - you can't really put that on a profit
152:38 - and loss you can track it i would
152:40 - suggest using mile iq but you cannot
152:42 - really put it on them on a profit loss
152:44 - so if you have mileage if you are
152:46 - running from client to client track that
152:49 - mileage and turn that into your tax
152:50 - accountant
152:52 - and then bottom line is any expenses
152:55 - that you do not feel confident in
152:57 - justifying to the irs should not be on
152:59 - your profit and loss
153:01 - period so
153:04 - if you
153:05 - i get a lot of clients that try to want
153:07 - to put
153:08 - their kids soccer club
153:10 - in their business they want to expense
153:12 - that out because they want to call it
153:13 - networking or they want to put their
153:14 - botox so they want to put every amazon
153:16 - charge they've ever had to their profit
153:19 - and loss and label it as office expenses
153:23 - i'm never going to tell clients what to
153:25 - do but i will tell you this is
153:28 - you always
153:29 - want to feel confident and if you were
153:31 - to ever to face an audit which i ever
153:33 - hope you do not have to do but if you
153:34 - ever have to face an audit that you can
153:36 - comfortably and confidently say that it
153:38 - was a business expense here's my receipt
153:41 - and here's my invoice so just keep that
153:43 - in the back your mind
153:45 - if you ever in question on i don't know
153:47 - if it's a businessman's i don't know if
153:49 - it's personal i don't know how to code
153:50 - this just keep that in the back of your
153:51 - mind
153:53 - and then
153:55 - one other item
153:56 - that
153:57 - depending on how you have your books set
153:59 - up is any kind of what they call bad
154:02 - debt so if you have any lingering
154:03 - invoices let's say they're six months
154:06 - old or old or
154:07 - a year or even more that you have not
154:10 - gotten paid on you know you're not going
154:12 - to get payment on i would bring that up
154:14 - to your tax accountant when you go to do
154:16 - taxes that may affect your taxes
154:19 - a little bit for the better it may not
154:21 - it really depends on how you have your
154:22 - book set up so i didn't really want to
154:24 - list that on there because it could be
154:26 - different for everyone's situation in
154:27 - terms of how their accounting
154:30 - is set up that really gets into accrual
154:32 - basis versus cash basis i don't want to
154:34 - get too far into that because
154:36 - everybody's going to be different but
154:37 - just keep that in mind keep track of
154:39 - those
154:41 - and just if you do have any lingering
154:43 - invoices bring that up to your attacks
154:44 - account and just let them know and see
154:46 - if they have any suggestions
154:49 - all right well i really hope this helped
154:51 - you all um
154:52 - please reach out if you have questions
154:55 - get training if you're not sure on what
154:57 - you're doing i know it's a lot but if
154:59 - you just start off on the right foot and
155:02 - you start these good habits
155:04 - it'll make your life so much easier and
155:06 - you will save money in the long run and
155:08 - you'll be that much more ahead of the
155:10 - game because you're going to know where
155:11 - you stand financially what decisions you
155:13 - can make how you can start to price
155:16 - where you can cut back and how you can

155:25 - little bit of research

155:40 - okay a big thanks to aaron now let's
155:42 - talk about how to manage your dev work
155:44 - on a day-to-day basis
155:52 - okay so it's time to start talking about
155:54 - how you're going to manage your
155:55 - substantive work on a day-to-day basis
155:57 - and by substantive work i mean the
155:59 - actual dev work which is the whole
156:01 - reason you started free code camp and
156:03 - got into being a developer in the first
156:05 - place
156:06 - and managing your deb work appropriately
156:09 - daily will allow you to maximize your
156:11 - profits
156:12 - and proper management of your day-to-day
156:14 - activities really focuses on two things
156:16 - first is the fact that you have to put
156:19 - in the time in other words you know you
156:21 - have to put the time into your business
156:22 - you have to go to work
156:24 - you would be surprised at how many
156:26 - entrepreneurs don't even put in a
156:28 - 40-hour work week and the second thing
156:30 - is you have to make sure you're working
156:32 - efficiently
156:34 - and why do i say that both of these are
156:36 - important putting in the time and
156:38 - working efficiently
156:40 - think of it like this
156:41 - suppose
156:42 - you go to work and i go to work and
156:45 - you're 25 more efficient than i am
156:49 - and you work 30 hours a week and i work
156:51 - 40 hours a week
156:52 - well if you're 25 more efficient than me
156:55 - then in 30 hours a week you will
156:57 - accomplish
156:58 - what takes me 37 and a half hours
157:01 - but because i went to work for 40 hours
157:02 - in a week i'm going to accomplish more
157:04 - than you and because i'm going to
157:05 - accomplish more than you i'm going to
157:06 - make more money
157:08 - so
157:09 - with that being said
157:11 - if you and i both go to work for 40
157:13 - hours and you're 25 percent more import
157:16 - or efficient than i am
157:18 - then in 40 hours you will accomplish
157:21 - what takes me 50 hours so this is why if
157:24 - you can work efficiently and put in the
157:26 - time
157:27 - you will make an astronomical amount of
157:30 - profits compared to what you would make
157:32 - otherwise
157:33 - now i think it's important to stress
157:35 - these things because
157:37 - you would be surprised at how many
157:39 - people don't put in 40 hours a week into
157:41 - their business
157:42 - so
157:43 - just as an example if you're going to
157:44 - work and you're not uh you know keeping
157:47 - track of your time which a lot of
157:48 - self-employed people don't it can be
157:49 - easy to feel like oh man i worked a lot
157:51 - today when again at the end of the day
157:53 - you're really not putting in as much
157:54 - time as you thought you did right
157:56 - so
157:57 - making sure you're putting in the time
157:59 - and tracking the time is
158:01 - rule number one so let's start by
158:03 - looking at that and then let's look at
158:05 - what you need to do in terms of making
158:08 - sure you're working efficiently and
158:10 - we'll give some tips for improved
158:11 - efficiency
158:22 - okay so the first part of being
158:23 - successful on a day-to-day basis is
158:25 - putting in the time when it comes to
158:26 - your business and putting in the time
158:28 - means that you've got a certain number
158:30 - of hours that you're going to work and
158:32 - that is just going to be a minimum that
158:33 - you're going to work every week there
158:34 - may be some weeks where you have to work
158:36 - more right because you may have a
158:37 - deadline you have to meet
158:39 - a project may be taking longer than
158:40 - expected and you have to work over to
158:42 - meet that deadline or something of that
158:44 - nature but the crucial part is to pick a
158:46 - number of hours you are going to work
158:48 - every week and make sure you put in
158:50 - those hours so in other words let's say
158:54 - you're
158:55 - you're going to work 40 hours a week at
158:57 - your business you get all your
159:00 - development work done in let's just say
159:02 - 30 hours then that means you've got 10
159:05 - hours left that you need to be devoting
159:06 - to marketing your business you know
159:08 - that's you use that extra 10 hours to
159:09 - write blog posts make youtube videos uh
159:11 - go to networking events
159:13 - things of that nature so
159:15 - again
159:16 - set a number of hours that you're going
159:18 - to work every week and make sure you are
159:20 - putting in those hours and there is
159:22 - always something for you to be doing so
159:25 - there's are what there are ways for you
159:26 - to make sure you meet those hours me
159:29 - personally in my business i'm i put in a
159:31 - minimum of 43.3 hours every week
159:34 - and when i tell people that number
159:36 - sometimes i get weird looks because 43.3
159:39 - is obviously not a round number
159:41 - where i came up with that is the fact
159:43 - that by working an extra 3.3 hours per
159:46 - week
159:47 - i wind up accomplishing in 12 months
159:50 - what would take someone working 40 hours
159:52 - a week
159:53 - 13 months
159:55 - in other words 3.3 hours more a week
159:57 - adds one more working month to my year
160:00 - and i find that combining that with
160:02 - trying to work efficiently really
160:04 - increases the amount i produce over a
160:06 - year over the course of a year i should
160:08 - say and as a result
160:09 - my income goes up so pick a number that
160:12 - you're going to put into your business
160:14 - and make sure you stick with it again if
160:16 - you don't have work to if you don't have
160:18 - development work to do put that extra
160:20 - time
160:21 - into marketing your business
160:24 - now
160:25 - it's really important that you do this
160:27 - in a way so that you avoid burnout let's
160:30 - say you decide you're going to work 45
160:32 - hours
160:33 - in a week
160:35 - you know on average okay and then let's
160:37 - say you have a week where you work 47
160:40 - well that means you can go ahead and
160:42 - take off two hours in another week and
160:44 - still be averaging 45 so in other words
160:47 - when i say i work 43.3 hours a week over
160:50 - the course of a year i make sure i
160:52 - average 43.3 some weeks i might work
160:54 - more some weeks i might work less if
160:56 - deadlines make me work more one week the
160:58 - next week i might take some time off or
161:00 - things of that sort so pick a number and
161:04 - stick with it and
161:06 - make sure that you put the time into
161:08 - something trust me there will always be
161:10 - something you can be doing
161:13 - in your business
161:15 - i cannot begin to tell you how many
161:17 - entrepreneurs i see who
161:19 - don't don't
161:21 - essentially know how much they work in a
161:22 - week like if you were to ask them how
161:24 - many hours do you require that you work
161:26 - in a week
161:27 - they don't have a number which i can
161:29 - understand someone saying they don't
161:30 - know how many hours they work in a week
161:32 - as a required number
161:34 - but then they also don't have for
161:35 - example set times of when they start
161:37 - work in the morning they don't have set
161:39 - times of when they go home they don't
161:42 - have set vacation schedules or
161:44 - requirements or anything like that so
161:46 - think of it like this
161:48 - those entrepreneurs
161:50 - don't get to work at any particular time
161:51 - just they just get to work whenever they
161:53 - feel like it
161:54 - they leave whenever they feel like it
161:57 - at the end of the week they're not
161:58 - making sure they've worked a certain
162:00 - number of hours
162:02 - and they just take vacation time
162:03 - whenever they want
162:04 - and people wonder why so many small
162:06 - businesses fail well one of the reasons
162:08 - why so many small businesses fail is
162:10 - just to be frank people who start up
162:11 - their own business don't put in the time
162:14 - so
162:15 - pick a number of hours
162:16 - stick with it
162:18 - and then make sure you're meeting those
162:20 - requirements and if you do that
162:22 - this may sound really simple
162:24 - but you will be ahead of a lot of your
162:27 - competition because your competition is
162:29 - just not going to put in the time it's
162:31 - just not going to happen
162:33 - put in the time for your business and
162:35 - you increase your chances of success
162:38 - just exponentially i can't stress that
162:40 - enough if you fail there's pretty good
162:42 - chances because you weren't putting in
162:44 - the time so again
162:47 - if you're going to make a full-time if
162:48 - you've decided to make
162:50 - your new development business a
162:52 - full-time job
162:53 - my suggestion is actually put your hour
162:56 - requirement a little bit over 40 hours
162:57 - because 40 hours is considered a normal
162:59 - work week right so
163:01 - challenge yourself a little bit do a
163:03 - little bit more again i get an extra
163:05 - month a year only by doing an extra 3.3
163:07 - hours a week if you say 3.3 hours a week
163:09 - sounds like a lot ask yourself how much
163:11 - time do you spend looking at facebook
163:12 - how much time you spend you know
163:14 - watching television i mean how much time
163:16 - do you spend you know engaging in other
163:18 - you know like idle activities just cut
163:20 - out a few of those things and make sure
163:21 - you're putting the time into
163:23 - growing your business and then if when
163:25 - you combine those hours with
163:27 - high efficiency you'll produce so much
163:29 - that so many people are going to look at
163:30 - you and go how did that person produce
163:32 - all that they just won't understand it
163:34 - and they and you will understand it was
163:36 - a
163:36 - function of the time you put in plus the
163:38 - efficiency so pick a number of hours and
163:42 - stick with it and hold yourself to it
163:44 - show some discipline you know get your
163:46 - work ethic in and put put in that work
163:48 - ethic and you will succeed
163:50 - so
163:51 - with all that being said now let's take
163:53 - a dive into how you can actually make
163:55 - sure that those hours are going to be
163:56 - working are going to be spent doing
163:58 - something efficient
164:10 - okay in our last segment we talked about
164:12 - the need to put in the hours when it
164:13 - comes to your freelance business but now
164:15 - let's talk about how you can be
164:16 - productive when you're putting in those
164:18 - hours
164:19 - it's i'm going to talk about this
164:20 - because it's really important to
164:21 - remember that putting in time
164:24 - it does not necessarily equal getting
164:26 - stuff done
164:28 - um i've seen plenty of situations where
164:30 - someone might actually spend literally
164:32 - 14 15 16 hours a day at work
164:35 - and leave the day leave at the end of
164:37 - the day accomplishing virtually nothing
164:40 - i actually know of entrepreneurs who and
164:42 - i feel bad for them literally work 16
164:45 - hours a day probably six to seven days a
164:48 - week and are just so inefficient in
164:50 - terms of how they go about their day
164:52 - that they accomplish probably what an
164:55 - efficient person would accomplish in a
164:57 - 30 hour work week so if you take putting
165:00 - in the time and combine it with
165:01 - efficiency that's how you become
165:03 - productive and that's how you make more
165:05 - money so the thing i can't stress to you
165:07 - enough again is you got to put in the
165:09 - time but don't think simply because
165:10 - you're putting in the time
165:12 - that you're being productive you have to
165:14 - put in the time but you also have to be
165:16 - efficient in your use of that time in
165:18 - other words you need to produce a lot
165:20 - per hour so think of it like this
165:24 - let's say you put in a lot of time let's
165:26 - say you put in 50 hours a week
165:30 - and now let's say you're
165:32 - twice as productive as
165:34 - somebody else
165:36 - that means in other words that you get
165:38 - twice done in an hour what someone else
165:39 - gets done in an hour which there are
165:41 - people that inefficient so there will be
165:43 - people that you're doubling their
165:44 - productivity
165:46 - if you put in 50 hours you're twice as
165:48 - productive as somebody else
165:50 - they have to go to work for 100 hours to
165:53 - you know accomplish uh you know what you
165:55 - did in 50 and if they're only working a
165:58 - 40 hour work week it takes them two and
166:00 - a half weeks to accomplish what you
166:01 - accomplish in one work week and that's
166:03 - how you make a lot more money you know
166:05 - as a freelancer as a self-employed
166:08 - developer so again
166:12 - just simply going to work
166:13 - does not mean you're getting stuff done
166:15 - you have to be efficient in your use of
166:16 - time
166:17 - so let's look at a few pointers and
166:19 - again these are just a few this is by no
166:21 - means an exhaustive list let's look at a
166:23 - few examples in terms of how you can be
166:25 - more efficient with the use of your time
166:28 - number one is what i call the ohio
166:30 - method ohio stands for only handle at
166:34 - once i'll talk about what this means in
166:35 - a minute
166:36 - number two focus on completing one thing
166:39 - at a time don't always have nine
166:41 - different projects that you're trying to
166:42 - complete simultaneously
166:45 - number three when problems come up deal
166:47 - with them immediately
166:48 - and number four is going to be improved
166:50 - management of communications and by this
166:52 - i mean things like email text messages
166:55 - so on so forth
166:57 - if nothing else
166:59 - if you nail those four areas
167:01 - you will be working so much more
167:03 - efficiently than so many people out
167:05 - there that at the end of the work week
167:06 - people will just wonder how you got so
167:08 - much done and the answer to how you got
167:10 - so much done will be
167:12 - you didn't let time just waste away to
167:14 - and get lost to inefficiency all right
167:16 - so let's look at each of the things i
167:18 - just mentioned in term number one the
167:21 - ohio method ohio this stands for only
167:24 - handle at once
167:25 - and this
167:26 - concept applies to anything whether it's
167:28 - an email whether it's a piece of paper
167:31 - sitting on your desk um you know an
167:34 - issue that comes up or anything
167:36 - don't deal with issues more than once so
167:38 - think of it like this a piece of paper
167:41 - comes in you open it open up the letter
167:43 - it's something from the secretary of
167:44 - state saying you've got to file
167:47 - something to renew your business license
167:49 - well don't just set it over here because
167:52 - as soon as you do that
167:54 - now then when you decide to deal with it
167:56 - later you've got to pick it up and read
167:58 - it again which means you took the time
167:59 - to read it when you first opened it and
168:01 - then you took the time to read it uh
168:04 - when you deal with it the second time so
168:05 - you're reading the thing twice instead
168:07 - of once right
168:08 - so when as soon as you pick up a piece
168:10 - of paper
168:12 - deal with it and under that scenario
168:14 - envelope comes in i open it i read it
168:18 - it's from the secretary of state's
168:19 - office saying hey you've got to renew
168:22 - your business license
168:24 - i'm immediately going to put this down
168:25 - i'm going to go online i'm going to
168:27 - renew my business license it's done i
168:29 - only touched that piece of paper once in
168:31 - other words i only handled it once
168:34 - think of how many times in your life
168:35 - have you opened an email
168:37 - read the email
168:38 - and then said i'll deal with this later
168:41 - right well then when you go to deal with
168:43 - it later you have to read the email
168:44 - again which again you just read the
168:45 - email twice
168:47 - so imagine if you could cut your time
168:49 - spent reading email in half right so
168:52 - only handle it once applies to anything
168:54 - from
168:55 - a piece of administrative paperwork to
168:59 - emails to you name it anything that
169:02 - comes across your desk only handle it
169:04 - one time now this can be something that
169:08 - can be like very
169:10 - for lack of a better word difficult for
169:13 - people to implement because it's really
169:15 - easy for something to come in and you
169:17 - look at it and go i don't have time to
169:18 - deal with this and you said it over here
169:19 - then you don't have time to deal with
169:20 - the next thing you set it over here you
169:22 - don't have time to deal with the next
169:23 - thing then like you set it over here and
169:26 - then you go to work on something and you
169:27 - work all day and like you finish that
169:30 - okay but then later on
169:33 - when you look at these again i don't
169:34 - have time to deal with this so you move
169:35 - it back over here next thing you know
169:36 - you've just moved the same pile of
169:38 - papers back and forth five times and
169:39 - think of all that time you've wasted and
169:41 - you felt busy but all you were doing was
169:43 - moving those papers back and forth which
169:45 - is again a massive massive waste of time
169:48 - so you've got to be disciplined in the
169:50 - sense that you're not going to pick
169:51 - something up unless you're prepared to
169:52 - deal with it and then when you do deal
169:53 - with it or i should say when you do pick
169:55 - it up you do deal with it that's
169:57 - something again it can be easy to go i
169:59 - don't have time for this
170:01 - you don't have time
170:03 - not to do things that way your time is
170:05 - so precious you have to get things
170:07 - handled once and only once okay so
170:09 - follow the ohio method that's rule
170:11 - number one only handle it once
170:14 - rule number two is focus on one thing at
170:17 - a time
170:18 - and by this i'm talking about in your
170:20 - development work you need to have one
170:23 - project finish it move on to the next
170:25 - project finish it move on to the next
170:26 - project finish it so
170:29 - like with us for example like let's say
170:31 - we've got i'm making up a number let's
170:33 - say we've got
170:34 - four clients we're building websites for
170:37 - the you know i don't work on client
170:38 - number one a little bit one day work on
170:40 - client number two a little bit
170:42 - of that day same day work on client
170:44 - three a little bit because all you've
170:45 - ever got that way is a little bit of
170:47 - each thing done
170:49 - and the reason that's bad is
170:52 - it requires a lot of mental energy to
170:53 - switch from one project to the next to
170:55 - the next and so you're constantly like
170:57 - getting an efficiency drain by switching
171:00 - projects like that instead what we do
171:02 - let's say we have four websites we're
171:04 - working on
171:05 - we finish the first one we work on it we
171:07 - finish it done out the door then we work
171:10 - on the second one finish it out the door
171:12 - third one finish it out the door so on
171:14 - so forth and if somebody calls and wants
171:17 - a project we tell them okay you're
171:19 - number five in line and we adjust the
171:21 - delivery date accordingly when they ask
171:23 - when can we have it by we give them an
171:24 - honest delivery date because we say
171:26 - we've got four people
171:27 - ahead of you you know just to give an
171:29 - example
171:30 - so
171:31 - don't jump from project to project and
171:33 - as you get busy you're going to have
171:35 - two three four and more projects under
171:38 - contract that you know you're going to
171:40 - be working on get one done then move on
171:42 - to the next one get it done then move on
171:44 - to the next one get it done and so on
171:47 - and so on and so on and if you've got a
171:49 - bunch of projects already
171:51 - lined up to do and somebody calls you
171:53 - wanting more work be honest with them
171:55 - about a delivery date say i've got this
171:57 - many ahead of you and here here's what
171:58 - comes next all right so one thing at a
172:01 - time and it again
172:04 - saves you all that mental energy of
172:05 - switching from project to project to
172:07 - project which is just a huge you know
172:09 - efficiency drain at the end of the day
172:12 - number three when problems come up
172:14 - deal with them immediately and
172:17 - here's what i mean by this is
172:20 - uh it's really easy for you know some
172:23 - for something to come up and then for
172:25 - you to say okay i'll deal with this a
172:28 - little later well if it's a problem and
172:30 - you put it off until later the problem
172:32 - only gets bigger the problem compounds
172:34 - so now it becomes a bigger issue to deal
172:38 - with
172:39 - and that can become a bigger issue to
172:41 - deal with in terms of money it can
172:42 - become a bigger issue to deal with in
172:44 - terms of time it can become a bigger
172:47 - issue to deal with in terms of you know
172:49 - other things so
172:52 - let me let me give you an example
172:55 - easy example i like to use something
172:57 - comes in from the secretary of state
172:59 - saying you've got to send a piece of
173:01 - paper in to renew your business license
173:04 - and
173:06 - things fall through the cracks and it
173:08 - doesn't get done so now you're late
173:10 - sending in your business license you get
173:12 - a notice from the secretary of state
173:14 - saying
173:15 - um
173:17 - you know
173:18 - you are now
173:19 - going to have to pay an extra 100 for
173:21 - your business license that's a problem a
173:23 - problem has just arisen you now have to
173:25 - get your business license renewed and
173:27 - there's an extra amount um associated
173:29 - with it by dealing with things as soon
173:32 - as you get them then bam they're taken
173:34 - care of right uh you know if you get an
173:36 - unhappy customer get them on the phone
173:38 - right away get it dealt with you're like
173:40 - right away if you see things in your
173:42 - business that seem like they're causing
173:44 - an efficiency eliminate them on the spot
173:46 - don't say oh man we really got to clean
173:48 - up that process no eliminate them right
173:49 - there on the spot don't let them cost
173:51 - you more time as things go on when
173:53 - problems come up get them dealt with and
173:55 - get them dealt with on the spot i cannot
173:58 - stress that enough
174:00 - number four is your management of
174:02 - communications and this is a big one
174:05 - communications are one of the biggest
174:08 - things that can make you feel busy even
174:10 - though you're not actually producing
174:11 - anything all right
174:13 - so
174:14 - let's look at the two ways that you can
174:16 - manage your communications in a way that
174:18 - will greatly and i do mean greatly
174:20 - greatly greatly
174:21 - uh increase your productivity all right
174:24 - and the first thing you can do in
174:25 - managing your communications is avoid
174:27 - real-time communication platforms like
174:29 - slack uh google hangouts and and things
174:32 - of that nature where it's more of a chat
174:35 - than it is um you know like a formal
174:37 - message
174:39 - it's really easy
174:41 - like on a service like slack for example
174:44 - to constantly see messages coming
174:46 - through and then when someone gets a
174:47 - message others are prompted to respond
174:49 - and so on so forth and you wind up
174:51 - having a much higher message volume than
174:54 - you would through a medium such as email
174:57 - and the thing is number one every time
174:58 - you get one of those messages you become
175:00 - highly distracted and it gets hard to
175:02 - get back to what you were doing and you
175:03 - get into a workflow and number two the
175:06 - overwhelming majority of those messages
175:08 - you're getting through a real-time
175:09 - service such as slack aren't actionable
175:11 - anyway they're just noise okay so
175:14 - you're basically filling your day with
175:16 - noise
175:17 - which makes you feel busy but again you
175:19 - don't actually produce anything avoid
175:21 - real-time communications altogether i
175:24 - cannot stress that enough we do not use
175:25 - them in our businesses we don't use
175:26 - slack we don't use google hangouts we
175:28 - don't use
175:29 - any of those things
175:31 - and on the subject of communications
175:34 - manage your email properly so and what i
175:36 - mean by that is
175:39 - go through your email one to two times a
175:41 - day or however often you feel is
175:43 - appropriate but set aside
175:44 - set times that you're going to go
175:46 - through your email
175:47 - and avoid your email during all other
175:50 - times think of it like this
175:53 - you sit down
175:54 - you open your inbox
175:56 - you get a message from a client
175:59 - you respond to it
176:01 - client responds back you respond to it
176:03 - again client responds back you respond
176:05 - again client response back
176:07 - okay that's three or four emails from
176:09 - the client you had to read
176:11 - and that's three or four responses
176:14 - you've had to write
176:15 - now we all know a lot of people use
176:17 - email in a way where as soon as a
176:19 - thought enters their head they gotta
176:20 - fire off an email to somebody about it
176:22 - right
176:23 - if you say i'm only gonna go through my
176:25 - email once a day and that's it so like
176:27 - let's say for example you're gonna go
176:28 - through your email at three in the
176:30 - afternoon from three to four you're
176:31 - gonna clear your email
176:33 - when you get up and or get to work i
176:35 - should say in the morning
176:37 - you've got
176:38 - one one email in your inbox from joe
176:40 - client
176:42 - during the course of the day joe sends
176:43 - you three or four more emails
176:45 - well now at you know three or four in
176:47 - the afternoon when you're gonna go
176:49 - through your email
176:50 - you can read all four or five emails joe
176:52 - sent you at one time and then you can
176:55 - send them a consolidated response to all
176:56 - of them right
176:58 - so in other words you get to type one
176:59 - response
177:00 - as opposed to
177:02 - typing three or four or five
177:04 - individual responses that becomes a huge
177:06 - time saver and the other thing is you
177:09 - actually have less email to read by
177:12 - following that
177:14 - approach because if joe is going to
177:15 - email you three four or five times
177:17 - during the day anyway
177:19 - if you're responding to each of those
177:21 - then he's likely to respond to your
177:23 - responses so you go from getting four or
177:25 - five emails in a day from joe to getting
177:26 - 15 right
177:28 - so you greatly reduce
177:30 - the number of emails
177:32 - you have to read
177:34 - by going through your email
177:36 - once a day or twice a day and but again
177:39 - leaving your inbox closed at all other
177:42 - times or if it's not going to be closed
177:44 - at least not responding so set aside set
177:47 - times that you're going to respond to
177:49 - email and then go through it using the
177:51 - ohio method which we discussed a minute
177:53 - ago so if an email asks you for
177:55 - something don't just respond and say
177:56 - i'll get back to you on that respond
177:58 - with what the email actually asks for
178:00 - and only go through that inbox once a
178:02 - day and you will be surprised at how
178:03 - much less time you spend
178:05 - than your competitors going through
178:07 - email
178:08 - so
178:10 - let's put together everything we just
178:12 - talked about
178:13 - let's say your competitor does not
178:16 - follow the only handle at once method
178:18 - which was number one
178:20 - which means
178:21 - your competitors that work 40 hours a
178:23 - week
178:24 - and they probably spend 10 hours just
178:25 - moving the same stack of paper back and
178:27 - forth like we talked about right so
178:29 - number one they don't follow the ohio
178:30 - method so how much time are they losing
178:32 - there
178:33 - number two your competitors
178:35 - jumping between projects all the time
178:37 - which means they don't produce as much
178:39 - right
178:40 - so let's say they lose
178:42 - you know an hour a day moving the paper
178:44 - back and forth by not using the ohio
178:46 - method let's say they lose 30 minutes of
178:48 - productivity a day
178:50 - by
178:51 - jumping from project to project now
178:53 - they've lost an hour and a half of
178:55 - productivity you know a day
178:57 - let's say they don't deal problems
178:59 - immediately and as a result the problems
179:01 - become more time consuming later let's
179:03 - add 15 minutes or up to an hour and 45
179:05 - minutes a day now let's suppose that due
179:08 - to inefficient communication practices
179:10 - which is what we just talked about with
179:11 - real-time communication services and
179:13 - email let's say
179:15 - they lose another two hours a day
179:17 - in an eight hour day we've just lost
179:19 - probably three to four hours three hours
179:21 - 45 minutes for you so call it three to
179:24 - four hours
179:25 - to essentially
179:26 - inefficiency so
179:28 - if you go to work for eight hours and
179:30 - that person goes to work for eight hours
179:33 - and they're losing let's say four hours
179:34 - of their their data inefficiency and
179:37 - you're not
179:38 - you're gonna produce twice as much as
179:40 - they are in an hour day
179:42 - which means you're going to make twice
179:44 - as much money as they do working the
179:45 - same amount of hours
179:48 - now combine that with the last section
179:49 - of our video where we talked about the
179:51 - need to put in a few extra hours and
179:53 - combine that
179:54 - extra productivity with
179:57 - those extra hours and actually know your
179:58 - income shoots through the roof right
180:01 - so
180:02 - again
180:03 - time but also productivity so focus on
180:07 - the tips we've just talked about
180:09 - in this and you are going to be fine
180:11 - so and you will actually see your income
180:13 - go up substantially
180:15 - well this is going to wrap up our course
180:17 - on how to succeed as a freelance
180:19 - developer i hope you found this helpful

Cleaned transcript:

hi my name is luke siciliano i'm a web developer and i'm also selfemployed i've decided to do this video for free code camp on the topic of how you can make money as a freelance developer or as someone who has just started up their own independent development business i feel that this is an important topic to talk about because a lot of people learn to code and then strike out on their own and quickly realize that running a business is a whole lot different than learning the code or working at dev job somewhere so the goal of this video is really to provide some tips and some framework for those who have decided to strike out on their own to hopefully make the whole venture a a little bit more enjoyable and be and most importantly a little bit more if not a lot more profitable so in this video we're really going to talk about a few different things number one is we're going to lay out some basic rules for making money as an independent developer and you may think well making money is easy i do work for people and i make money well some developers make a lot more money than others and the things we're going to focus on in that segment will touch on why and how you can actually increase your profits and make more money as a developer the second thing we're going to talk about is planning your new business and what i mean by this is the fact that you don't want to just run out and you know hang up your sign and say woohoo i'm in business now you really need to have a plan in place that deals with things such as what type of customers are you going to serve what types of services are you going to offer and you know what kind of company are you going to form and so on so forth if you have all those things nailed it from the getgo then you wind up making a lot more money and having a lot less stress on the back end so that's the second thing we'll be talking about the third thing we'll be talking about is actually getting started and at that point you've made your plan you've decided who you're going to serve what services you're going to offer and all that good stuff but now you've actually got to form the business you've got to get your infrastructure in place and all those things and that's what we'll be dealing with in that part of the video and in the fourth segment of this video we'll talk about managing your business on a daytoday basis from both an administrative standpoint as well as a development standpoint and you're gonna find that doing both are equally important and if you manage yourself on a daytoday basis correctly you can really make a lot more money so before we dive into it let's talk about who this video is for if you're someone who has already decided i'm going to go the freelance route i'm going to start an independent development shop or you've already done that you know in other words you're already on your own somewhere then this video is for you if you are debating whether or not you want to be a freelance developer whether or not you want to start your own dev shop or just kind of debating whether you want to get a job for somebody and that's a topic i've already discussed in a prior video and we're going to link to that in the description below with a time stamp so i would suggest watching that portion of that video before deciding whether or not you know this video is appropriate for you so with all that said let's get to it and good luck okay so the first thing we're going to talk about is the three basic rules to making money as a freelance developer and you've gotta nail all three of these things otherwise you're really gonna find yourself feeling like you're always stuck in second gear if not first gear and you're gonna feel like you just can't get ahead in your business and you may very well quit right because what happens when you feel like you're not getting ahead you certainly don't want to continue with something so understanding the three rules to making money as a freelancer is key before we get into anything else so what are the three rules number one is understanding that the amount of money you're going to make is in direct proportion to the amount of value you provide to other people so in other words you other person provide value okay that's rule number one rule number two is understanding the need to focus on your highest paying activities which may sound like duh but you would be surprised at how many people struggle in that area and rule number three is the need to understand that you have a fulltime job and put in the time as soon as you strike out on your own again may sound common sense but you would be surprised so let's go ahead and take a look at each of these three rules all right and again you have to do all three number one the amount of money you're going to make is in direct proportion to the amount of value you provide to other people what do i mean by this and first thing you got to do is put yourself in the shoes of a customer all right the customer doesn't care about your experience the customer doesn't care about you know what languages you know they don't care about how much time you're going to put into something all that matters to them is the amount of value their business receives from the product you provide to them right let's say for example you're building an app for let's say a little restaurant and uh you know the restaurant owner says hey i want an app where people can order food online i want an app where people can make reservations online uh see my menu things of this nature somebody comes along and offers to build this app in a content management system like wordpress or joomla or something like that and they tell the restaurant whether they'll do it for three thousand bucks you come along and you tell the restaurant owner that you'll build them something from scratch you'll write your own html you'll write your own css you'll write your own javascript and you're gonna charge them five thousand dollars well here if your five thousand dollar app is right here and someone else's three thousand dollar cms bait pace app is right here and you provide no more functionality and no more value to the client in other words you don't make the client's business any better with your app than this person does with their app then all that all you've done is propose something that's more expensive right if you're not providing additional value to your customer they're not gonna pay more money okay why would i pay five thousand for something i can get the exact same functionality for three thousand um so what you've got to understand is the more you improve the customers situation the more money that customer is going to be willing to pay you okay so in other words it's not about what you think is important it's about what the customer sees as value so instead of saying mine's better because i'm not using a cms and i'm writing it i'm writing all the code myself again that doesn't make the customer's situation any better right but i hear from developers all the time and i've had many conversations with freelance developers who really do think that simply by coding things from scratch instead of using you know different tools that they're somehow providing a better product like well these are people who don't understand it's about providing value to the customer so if you're going to write something from scratch for the customer what you need to do is explain how your app provides value that the other one doesn't so for example hey that person's building you an app in a content management system here are some of the limitations in the content management system it may limit you in terms of how you want to grow your business with the app i'm going to write for you however you won't have those limitations and then you explain to them about how your app provides additional value that the other one does in other words value meaning your app allows their business to grow more than the other app does okay so taking the approach of understanding that you've got to explain value to your customers is how you're going to make more money always put yourself in your customers perspective and ask yourself what is it the customer is looking for what does the customer see as valuable the more you provide that value to the customer the more the customer is going to be willing to pay you okay that's rule number one provide value to the customer rule number two is the fact that you need to focus on your highest paying activities way too often i mean way too often people get themselves in this trap of focusing on work that has the highest total price tag but doesn't necessarily pay the most per unit of input let's use a simple example let's say i'm going to write a dinky little app for somebody pretty simple um it's only gonna take me maybe five hours uh i'm gonna charge them twenty five hundred bucks for it let's say that's five hundred dollars an hour right now let's say but it's also only twenty five hundred dollars now let's say the opportunity to write another app comes along and on that app i'm going to charge 50 000 but i have to put in a lot and i mean a lot more time for obvious reasons on that big app well the first app you know let's say i made 2505 hours okay it's 500 an hour second app let's say when i sat sit down and look at it later i realized i only made 350 an hour on it a lot of people will get in the trap of saying well you know i made more money over here because i made 25 000 as opposed to 2500 but what they're not recognizing is that you only have so much time in the day you only have so many resources to go around and you need to put those resources into the higher value activities so one was just enough the higher dollar amount in that scenario was just a chance to work more basically so what you want to do is look at the kinds of services you're providing and let's say you're providing three different services four different services to customers whatever service you're providing pick the one that pays the most per hour of input per resource that you put into it and do more of that so using my scenario from a minute ago the 2500 app that you can get done in five hours go out and find as many customers as you can to churn those apps out forget that larger work just try to turn those other things out in mass because again you make more per unit of input on those think of it in these terms if you have a choice of going to a job that pays you ten dollars an hour and you can work all the hours you want you have a choice of going to another job that pays you 15 an hour and you can work all the hours you want i would hope you would go to the 15 an hour job all the time and never show up at the 10 hour job again right i mean that's only common sense so you've got to take this same approach into your freelance business whatever's paying you the most focus on that and do as much of that as you humanly can we're going to talk a little bit more about this in a little bit later section in this course but for right now understand that the second rule of making money is focusing on the activities that pay you the most per unit of input your highest value activities okay so rule number one provide value to the customer rule number two is focused on the activities that are of the highest value to your freelancing business rule number three is you've got to put in the time again that may sound simple but you would be really surprised once you decide to go out on your own you have a fulltime job you need to work fulltime at your business this may sound like a sound like a shock but you don't get paid for not going to work okay so let's say you've got two customers um you're just starting out and right now those two customers keep you busy for say 15 hours a week a lot of developers are going to do that 15 hours of coding work and you know customer service every week and then after that just kind of sit around twiddle their thumbs you know wait for more work to come in the door but again what they don't understand is like i said once you strike out on your own you have a fulltime job so let's just say you call a fulltime job 40 hours a week well if your customers are only taking up 15 hours a week that means you have 25 more hours that you need to be out trying to hustle up more business so 15 hours working for customers 25 hours trying to hustle up more business equals your 40 hours and think how many more customers you'll have if you put in that time in other words there is something you can be doing on you know to fill up your hours and make it a fulltime job treat your business like a fulltime job you're not going to make any money unless you work at it and as silly as that may sound again you would be surprised i i've talked to small business owner after small business owner after small business owner who doesn't work 40 hours a week a lot of times they don't work 30 hours a week and they're wondering why they're not making any money well you don't make money for not working okay so rule number one focus on providing value to your customer understand that your customer only cares about the value they receive and focus on providing as much value to them as humanly possible rule number two is identify the activities in your business which pay you the most per unit of input your highest value activities to yourself and focus on those rule number three is put in the time if you follow those three things you really are going to be ahead of a very large percentage of other freelance developers out there and i mean a very large percentage of them you are ahead of the game from the getgo just by understanding those three things okay and because you're going to understand those three things that's why you're going to do well working for yourself so now that we've talked about the three basic rules of making money let's talk about the planning stage of your new business okay let's go ahead and talk about the planning stage of your new company and what i mean by the planning stage is the fact that these are uh tasks and plans you should have in place before you even start taking customers if you do already have customers which is common freelance businesses then before you go out and try to bring in a whole lot more business you should really be knocking out the things we're about to talk about the reason why i say it's common for people to already have customers before they've planned out their business is a lot of times people start freelancing as a result of getting a random phone call and someone asking to complete a project and then bam next thing you know you're a freelancer so wherever you're at in your business whether you've already got your first customer or two or whether you're decided to strike out on your own and have not done so yet the following tasks that we're about to talk about are things that you need to get planned and in order before you start trying to take customers at any kind of scale okay um so we're really going to talk about four total things excuse me when it comes to planning your business number one is funding your operations um you may be thinking well what funding we'll talk about that in a minute number two is deciding what niche you're going to serve in other words you're not just going to provide random services to as many people as possible you want to actually pick a niche that you're going to serve and stay within that lane number three is figuring out what services you're going to offer within that niche and number four is going ahead and getting your company formed once you've got all those things figured out so let's go ahead and look at each of these things in turn okay so the first thing we need to talk about is how you're going to find your new business and right now when you hear that you might be thinking what funding is involved as a freelancer all i need to write code is my laptop and i already have that you will quickly be surprised at how fast expenses do start to add up for even someone who's selfemployed you're going to have different service costs those service costs can include paying an accountant at the end of the year they can include paying for liability insurance for your business they can include the cost of a payroll company because you're going to want to form what's called nest corp which we'll talk about a little later um also if you're going to uh rent server space you're going to that's the service you're going to pay for in other words expenses will add up a lot faster than you may think and the one thing i cannot stress enough is that you want to be profitable from day one in your business and profitable every essentially every month after day one and month one it's really common in the technology industry for people to think it's okay to lose money for the sake of growth that is not okay it is not okay i know there are some big companies that have operated that way but trust me that is the exception it is not the rule contrary to what you see in the media what i would strongly suggest is for that you read a book called profit first we're going to link to it in the description below it talks a lot about why it is not okay for you to ever be losing money so in other words you want to be profitable from day one and you want to never be unprofitable okay so since you need to be profitable from day one the first manner of business is figuring out how to fund your operations do not go into debt to start your business okay mark cuban is on record as saying that only idiots would uh take out a loan or worse yet use a credit card to start a business if you take out a loan trust me the bank doesn't care if you are making money or not you've got to make those payments if you borrow money from relatives if you want you know not paying your relatives back might be a good way to destroy your relationship with them and if you start using credit cards next thing you know you're paying extremely high interest rates so do not go into debt it's essentially digging yourself into a hole that can be very difficult to get out of if you're someone that's just starting out and you've already got your first customer then whatever they're paying you essentially needs to sit in your business bank account and not go into your pocket it needs to sit in your business bank account and serve as a source of funding for when you get your next client if you don't have your first client yet and you're striking out on your own then as we talked about in our last section you need to be working 40 hours a week at your new business but you also need to be making some other money on decide to support yourself so whether that's for some kind of side hustle whether it's driving for uber or whatever you need to be selffunding in this in other words your business needs to fund itself and if you're just starting out then you need to fund your new business from whatever your other form of employment or income is in other words be uh selffunding and profitable from day one do not take out debt do not take out loans this is something i cannot stress enough so best ways to fund your new business there are quite a few like i said if you have a fulltime job and you've decided to go the freelance route then guess what you now have two fulltime jobs stay at your current job while working fulltime at your freelance gig until you're in a spot where you can quit the fulltime job which if you're hustling up at the freelance gig and working full time at it you will be able to quit your fulltime job pretty quickly okay so your current source of your current employment can be a form of funding uh if you've got your first client again what they pay you should just sit in the operating account there's funding for your business don't take it out and spend it leave it in there to fund the business if you don't have a job currently and you are striking out on your own as a freelancer and you don't have any clients then again what you need to be doing is driving for uber or finding other ways to make money and live off of that and live off of that and leave some in the um you know in your reserve so you can also fund your business going forward but fund your business with cash that you have in cash that you earn do not fund it with debt that is something i cannot stress enough one of the best ways to make sure your freelance business fails is to start taking on debt okay and just think of it like this it's pretty hard to go broke if you don't know anybody any money right when you think of people who go broke it's usually because of that avoid debt in your new business i can't stress this enough this is something i'm not going to go on and on about instead again read profit first it's linked to in the description below okay so since we've talked about the biggest rule of funding your business avoid debt and fund it from other sources let's go ahead and talk about picking a niche for your new business okay so let's talk about choosing a niche for your new freelance business and what do i mean by niche by niche i mean you need to select a relatively narrow group of customers you're going to serve and or a relatively narrow group of services you're going to provide you do not want to take the approach of saying i need work i will take whatever is available and whatever comes in my door picking a niche is this strategy for making more money taking whatever comes in the door is a strategy for making less money so let's look at two things number one let's figure out why it is you need a niche in the first place and number two let's go about how you pick that niche okay so number one why do you need a niche in the first place well as i just said a second ago it leads to you having a less scalable business let's use a really simple example suppose i own a restaurant and i come to you and i say hey i want you to build me an app that for my restaurant that does a b and c okay to get that app working you may have to incorporate some thirdparty applications into it which means you have to go out and research those thirdparty applications you have to figure out what you need to do to incorporate them in the app when you build it and so on so forth you also might not know anything about the restaurant industry and as a result of that you need to take the time to learn a lot about the industry in general so you can learn about my business and build me a quality app and you charge me five thousand dollars for my app now later when the second restaurant comes along and wants a similar app you're already familiar with those thirdparty applications you already know a little bit about the restaurant industry that is all learning that you do not have to do a second time in order to charge the same amount of money the second time when you're building that second application so in other words by staying within the niche under this example restaurants you make more money unless you make uh more money by providing the same service in less time right to the second customer that's what happens when you choose a niche you're not in a state where you're constantly learning new languages learning new applications learning new industries and so on so forth the value of experience allows you to scale up your business and make more money by charging the same rate for your services but getting things done in less time okay what happens when you don't pick a niche well then you're constantly learning new languages you're constantly dealing with different kinds of businesses you're less likely to be able to reuse old code bases that you've written and so on so forth so picking a niche allows you to build a scalable business i cannot stress that enough now it is really really easy when you're first starting out to say i'm gonna take whatever comes in the door right um because after all you're just starting out you need clients but let's look at what that leads to you take whatever comes in the door as i said a minute ago you have to maybe learn a new language you have to learn some new frameworks you have to learn new applications you have to learn about a new industry and as a result you make some money but you don't make as much as you could the second time around right and now when your second client comes in the door the problem is because you're just taking anything and not sticking in a niche your second client is in an industry or field that has nothing to do with the first one so again you gotta learn some new applications and learn some new frameworks so on so forth you're constantly in a state of working more hours for less money and as a result of that you never get ahead and because you never get ahead you find yourself saying i need work so i'm going to take whatever comes in the door and it just becomes a vicious cycle that you literally never get out of so while it may be tempting to say i'm going to come whatever or i'm going to take whatever comes in the door i should say because i need money right now you have to recognize that that is a trap and it becomes very difficult to get out of taking work simply because it's available when it's outside of a niche you want to serve is like stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime it is not a good idea to step over a dollar and pick up a dime so when you get those work opportunities early on that are outside of the niche you're trying to serve it's hard but it's important to say no and trust me i completely understand it is hard to say no to revenue it is hard to say no to a potential customer but if it's outside that niche you want to serve whether that niche is working with a particular class a customer or providing a particular type of service or a combination of both it's important to say no when something falls outside your niche i just cannot stress that enough picking a niche means a more scalable business so how do you go about picking that niche right um that's a that's an important question uh that's really a broad topic and which could probably be i would say the subject of a second extremely long video the general rules i'll give you for picking a niche are pick something that you either are either one of two things one interested in it or two uh passionate slash you get excited about it um you know or you're good at it i guess would be a third thing so why do i say to pick something that you are excited about passionate about something your excuse me something you're really good at or something you have a particular skill set at number one is the fact that those are going to be things that you're likely to stick out the grind through right think of it like this if you're trying to do something that you're not good at and you're not excited about start and you're in those hard days of starting a business where the chances you're going to stick with this thing that you're not any good at and not excited about when you're already facing the struggles of starting a business the chances of you sticking with that aren't very good right so by picking something that you're either good at or excited about the chances are you're going to stick it out you know through the grind a lot more number two is the fact that if you're picking something that you're already good at and passionate about you're gonna find that that gives you the ability to provide more value than your competitors in that area so you're going to have a competitive advantage in large part because you are willing to put in that time so willingness to stick it out competitive advantage are the two big reasons why when choosing a niche you need to pick something that you're good at something that you're passionate about something that just kind of gets you excited um so on so forth the things i mentioned one interesting question i would say i get a lot is well how do i pick a niche and then i say what i just said i say well what are you excited about what do you like to do what are you good at and people didn't look at me a little bit confused and just to be frank the question of what do you like to do shouldn't be a hard question i mean what is it you like to do right um you know find things you are interested in personally and then try to make those your business and then that's something you're going to be more likely to stick with over time don't over complicate the idea of finding something that interests you and then just kind of rolling with it i cannot stress that enough so number one pick a niche number two is when you're picking that niche find something you're interested in something you're excited about um you know so on something you enjoy so on and so forth okay so now that that's out of the way let's get on to the next part of our video okay now that you've decided what niche you're going to serve it's important to figure out what services you're going to offer to that niche and then how you're going to charge for those services so let's look at each of those and we're really going to break this part of the discussion down into three sections the first section is going to be what services to offer the second section is going to be how to charge for those services and then the third part is going to be the need to make sure you're adding recurring revenue okay so let's look at each of these in turn number one what services should you be offering your potential customers that are within the niche you've picked out for yourself well what services to offer really comes down to three things and the first of these three things is how much are you interested in the work the second of these three things is to what extent is it scalable the third of these three things is to what extent can you outsource some of the work those three things decide what services you should be offering your niche let's look at each of those the reason why your level of interest is important when you're deciding what services you're going to offer is simple if you're performing work that you find boring that you find dull that you don't care about whatsoever the chances of you wanting to stick with it long term and build a business are slim to none to if there was a way to say negative it would probably be negative think of it like this if you have a nine to five job you certainly don't want to go to something that's completely boring every day right well trying to do that in the grind of your own business is even harder so when deciding what services to offer it needs to be something that interests you number one even if something interests you though to have a viable business it needs to be something you can scale out in other words something you can do at scale and the scalability of your idea really has two components to it number one is the fact of is or is the question of is there enough of a customer base out there you may perform a task for somebody and really enjoy the work and then find out it's just something that doesn't come up that much if there's not enough of a market out there that's not something you're going to be able to do at scale but the other aspect of scalability is the extent to which you can do the work without having to completely do everything over each time so in other words if you want to build a particular type of app for somebody and you realize it's a code base you can reuse and build similar apps for a large number of other people that's scalable because you're reusing that code base for similar customers over and over and over again so in other words you make more money off the second customer then you make off the first customer you make more money off the 10th customer than you make off the second one because you're refining this process every time because you're charging the same amount of money for the app each time right so scalability which again is size of the market and your ability to not have to replicate or to not have to start work over every time those are really how you look at the scalability aspect of this okay and number three in there again when deciding what services to offer is to what extent can you outsource some of this work even if you work 24 7 365 there are only so many hours in the day which means you can only take on so many customers if you want to make money as a freelancer and eventually scale up into a larger business you're going to have to get some of the work off of your plate so you can continue focusing on high value activities so when you're putting together a service that you're going to offer you need to say how much of this work can be performed by people that maybe have like entrylevel coding skills how much of it can you outsource for you know like a decent price to other developers and so on so forth if for some reason you look at your service offering and realize it just cannot be outsourced in any way or that there aren't even components of it that can be outsourced that's probably not a good service offering to get into if you have something you're interested in if you have something you can scale and you have something where at least a good chunk of the work can be outsourced at a later time now you have something that a you can make a lot of money off of and b eventually scale into a larger business and that's why you're going to do that threepart analysis in deciding what services to offer within your nation again not to sound too repetitive but that threepart analysis is your level of interest the extent to which you can scale it out and the extent to which you can outsource some of this work so that's how you decide what you're going to offer once you've decided what you're going to offer it's important to look at how you're going to charge for it and i cannot stress enough it's important to charge flat fees or charge a set price for products as opposed to charging say by the hour charging by the hour would be you know telling someone you'll build them an app and you'll charge them x number of dollars per hour and at the end of the day you know you give them a bill and again the problem with this is the fact that there are only so many hours in a day you're trading time for money which is always a losing proposition by charging flat fees you get to take advantage of the work you have already done so for example if you build an app that serves a particular type of business you charge the business three thousand dollars for that app and then later on a second similar business comes along and wants a similar app you've already done a good amount of the work okay so you can reuse a lot of that code base and then charge three thousand dollars for an app the second time and the customer the second customer should say is still getting full value even though you're charging them three thousand dollars because they're getting the value of your expertise you became an expert in this area the first time you built the app they're getting the fact that you would have already worked any bugs out of the app because you probably debugged it as part of dealing with the first customer and so on so forth so by charging flat fees you what you make more per unit of your own input and you actually give better value to the customer so it's good for both sides you make more profits the customer gets a better experience and then the last thing i'll say when it comes to choosing what to offer pricing that offer is third thing would be the need to add recurring revenue and this is revenue where you don't necessarily have to make a brand new sale every month in order to bring in some income into your business and one of our businesses for example we have virtual private servers and then we offer the clients the option to have us host their app on our servers which we do and then so we essentially resell server space and then the clients pay a flat fee for that every month so on top of the fact that we just have money coming in every month for new sales to new customers there's a certain aspect that we can just count on coming in every month you know again for that recurring reselling revenue having recurring revenue really helps to kind of take out some of the highs and lows of working for yourself otherwise you might have months where you make a whole lot and months where you make a little having that recurring revenue really gives you some flexibility to let you kind of go along with your business okay so we've just talked about what services to offer how much to charge and we've talked about the need for recurring revenue so with all of that said let's get on to the next part of our video okay now that we've talked about what services you're going to offer and how you're going to charge for those services we need to talk about actually forming your business and this is going to be the last part of our discussion in the planning stages of starting your own freelance enterprise okay so forming your business really takes on a couple of different things number one is choosing the type of business entity you're going to use for your company and number two is actually getting it formed uh here's the one thing i want to stress before i get into these is this video should not be considered legal advice i'm not holding myself out as someone licensed to give you advice in forming a company on legal consequences and things of that sort those are things that should really be discussed with an attorney i cannot stress that enough that there can be serious consequences to choosing the wrong wrong form i should say for your business so it's always good to discuss these kinds of matters with a business lawyer when it comes to picking a business entity it's not a matter of just running out and starting to service clients once you decide to become a freelancer in most places you're going to need some kind of a business license okay working without that business license can be a crime in some places and usually is but also you want to really start to think about forming a company and in other words instead of just going out and getting a business license and working as a sole proprietor there can be benefits to forming a company such as a corporation or an llc which is a limited liability company um forming an s corp or forming some other kind of corporate entity again the kind of it that excuse me the kind of entity you choose is going to depend on the overall goals of your business and that's why it's best to talk to a lawyer what we do in our company is we've chosen to operate as an llc a limited liability company the benefits of an llc are number one it is an actual separate entity in other words it's considered a separate legal entity from my partners and i so what the llc means is that when our customers sign a contract they don't sign it with us as individuals they sign it with the llc they don't pay us as individuals they pay the llc when business expenses come up they don't get paid by us personally they get paid by the llc the llc has its own bank account and things of that nature um if the if you know we need a contract for services like if we have to rent server space the llc signs the contract with somebody else not you know we don't sign that as individuals the many benefits of having an llc include protections from liability so like let's say for example we were to sign a longterm contract with a vendor let's say we signed uh signed up for server space and had to sign a one year commitment for that and let's say after six months for whatever reason our business fails and we don't want to be in business anymore and the server space vendor decides to try to take us to collections or to even sue us to collect the rest of the money they were owed they could only sue the llc they could not sue us as individuals generally speaking so in other words it protects your individual credit your individual assets and um things of that nature can also protect you under the right circumstances from liability from your clients so you know if a client ever comes along and says hey you know i hired joe developer to do the software work for me and he bungled my app and i'm suing them for damages well if they're contracted with an llc generally speaking they can sue the llc and not the individual so having an llc really does provide you with liability protection which can be really crucial when you're going into business one of the other big benefits of having all an llc which again is what we have is that comes with several tax advantages namely allows you to save on uh what would be selfemployment taxes that you would pay if you're just working as a sole proprietor the discussion on how uh having an llc can save you on selfemployment taxes it can be quite lengthy and i've actually done a separate video on that previously for free code camp we're going to link to that video in the description below okay so when you're trying to decide what to do i would suggest watching that video but again the first thing i would suggest you do is talk to some kind of business law attorney or corporate counsel on what is the best fit for your particular situation in your particular location to meet your particular goals so the one thing i want to stress in this is don't just run out and start doing work figure out what kind of entity it is you should probably form and get that entity formed before you go out and and get the appropriate licenses before you go out and start trying to hustle up work for your new business so now that we've talked about the need to form some kind of business sanity or to minimum get the appropriate licenses we're all done talking about the planning stage for your new business your new business is officially planned congratulations it is now time to actually get started on doing some work and making some money so let's get to it okay at this point of our video we've just talked about the planning stages of your business in other words you've decided to become a freelance developer and you've done all that initial planning so you can have a business that's going to run well and run properly and be well thought out and you're not just going to go out and try to open up your own shop and haphazardly go about your business in other words because you've planned things out you're set up for success now we need to talk about some things you need to do initially to actually get the doors open to your new enterprise okay and those three those areas that you need to get knocked out first are going to really fall into two categories one is administrative tasks that you need to get set up and ready to go before you start taking customers and the second is marketing items that you need to get set up and ready to roll before you start taking customers and the third thing i would say you need to do on top of those is before you even start taking a customer is decide right now you're going to be a continuous learner and i'll talk about all three of these in a minute and what i mean by each of them but the one thing i want to stress before we get into your checklist and things to do when it comes to starting your own business is the importance of starting off on the right foot okay in other words you need to have all your administrative and clerical and legal requirements met before you start taking customers you need to have a lot of your marketing infrastructure in place before you go out and start taking customers and you also need to be just learning about new things before you start taking customers the reason i say especially when it comes to your administrative and marketing stuff that you need to have these things organized and have all your ducks in a row before you really start trying to run your business is because if you don't get these things organized now then running your business later is going to be much harder just think of it like this um you know you don't get you don't get very well organized uh when you start up shop as a result there were documents you were supposed to file with the irs or the secretary of state that didn't get filed but then you just started taking customers right and then you're right in the middle of a coding project and you get a notice from the secretary of state that some items need to be taken care of immediately otherwise you will no longer be legally allowed to do business this means you would have to stop your coding project in the middle of what you're doing to go deal with an administrative headache that should have been dealt with before as a result your project's probably going to be delayed to the client the client is going to be unhappy you may have to give them a partial discount if not a refund and it's just going to create a whole host of headaches for you okay so in other words by having all your administrative tasks lined up completed those initial tasks just done and organized you help avoid those fires from popping up later that you then have to stop what you're doing and put out and by being organized in the beginning you make more money later and the same is true with your marketing if you've got your marketing infrastructure in place then you don't have to stop what you're doing later in in a mad panic to try to drum up clients okay so the one thing again i just cannot stress enough is get your all your get all your ducks in a row and get organized before you even start taking customers so again let's look at it from an administrative standpoint a marketing standpoint and then things you need to be learning about on an ongoing basis okay when starting your company there are going to be several essentially what i call administrative tasks that you're going to need to get taken care of and out of the way and again as i stress in the introduction of this section you want to get these tasks taken care of now so that they don't become problems later so by getting all these things out of the way you can actually focus on the important thing which is doing dev work okay so there's a few different things you want to get out of the way up front number one is you got to decide if you're going to form a company or work as a sole proprietor i talked at a previous section of this video about why we use an llc in our business talk with an attorney or a lawyer um you know get a consultation with a business law lawyer about whether you should form a corporation whether you should form an llc uh you know uh whether you form some kind of partnership in other words talk to an attorney to see what's best for your particular situation uh we use an llc in our business and i know a lot of times that's what an attorney is going to suggest to you but talk to a lawyer and figure out what actually is the best course for you given your particular needs your particular circumstances the laws and regulations of where you live and so on and so forth so number one is get your company formed but after your company is formed it's important to make sure that you're keeping up with the business requirements of wherever you live so for example in ohio where i live once you form your company and you get your business license you don't need to renew your business license every year but there are other states where you do need to renew your business life license every year in nevada for example along with renewing your business license every year you have to file what's called a list of officers every year so the reason i'm telling you all this is the to stress the importance of the fact that the rules and regulations you have to follow are going to be different depending on where you live so it's really important that you know the regulations and rules of where you live and you keep up with them and again having a lawyer will help you to do these things if you don't keep up with those regulations and you might lose your ability to do business um if you're you know if you're in a place that you have to renew your business license every year and you don't renew it you may actually be committing a crime by engaging in business without having the appropriate licensing so in addition to getting your company formed make sure you're aware of your local regulations and that you're keeping up with them so number one is decide what kind of entity you're going to form and keep up with your local rules and regulations number two is to get a separate address for your business generally speaking i personally consider it a bad idea to use your home address as your business address there's no reason you can't but that means for example putting your home address on your company website that means putting your home address on any contracts you sign with clients that means having business mail come to your house so on so forth for just personal peace of mind reasons it can be a good idea to have a separate address for your business and then also if you're going to be forming a separate entity like an llc there may be other benefits to having a separate address and you'd want to talk about those benefits with an attorney as well in terms of where to have a separate address uh lots of uh excuse me lots of freelance developers will use just a post office box since a lot of freelancers are working out of their house if you're working at a shared space such as a wework or a regis a lot of times you can have that shared office space and receive mail there so if you're considering one of those kinds of spaces ask them what kind of services they offer in terms of you know using uh their addresses your business address receiving mail there and things of that nature so post office box some kind of shared office space there in other words there are low cost options for having a separate mailing address for your business third thing is to get a separate bank account for your company for this you'll need an ein from the irs that's an employer identification number you'll need that ein if you are starting a separate entity such as an llc or corporation or something like that you want to have a separate bank account for your business for a few reasons number one if you're starting a separate entity such as an llc or corporation that entity is a separate you know essentially a separate person from you so your bank account needs to be kept separate from that number two it helps you keep your book straight in terms of uh what's a personal expense and um what's a business expense number three having a separate account for your business allows you to stay a lot more disciplined when it comes to budgeting your business finances one of the biggest reasons though for having a separate bank account is the legal reasons that an attorney will tell you about you protect yourself and your business by having a separate account for your business and that is something to talk about with a lawyer after you've started a bank account and you know you've got your business address and all that stuff there are certain software software services and just professional services you want to sign up for you know for your new business and that brings us to the fourth thing on my list which is software and services that you need to sign up for the first of those is to get some type of a business suite such as g suite from google or office 365 from microsoft these will make it much easier for you to have a branded email so in other words instead of you know instead of your personal email or instead of new developer at gmail.com you know you can actually have an email on your own domain which you don't have to have a business suite like g suite in office 365 to do this obviously but it makes managing your email easier and the big benefit of those types of business suites is they include other services such as uh calendaring uh uh cloud drive storage and a few other things that are specific to business um i'd they're relatively inexpensive and i would strongly suggest signing one of them up we use g suite in our business and it makes our life a whole lot easier you want to sign up for your accounting software that is uh you know how you're going to do your bookkeeping there are a lot of options here there's quickbooks online there's wave apps there's freshbooks we personally use wave in our business i find it to be very easy to use and the price is right because it's free for you know for certain services so again we use wave but that's not what you have to use but definitely you want to sign up for accounting software um you know so you can do your uh you know so you can do your uh bookkeeping i can't stress enough the importance of regular bookkeeping and that's something we'll talk about a little bit later in this video the next thing you want to sign up for is credit card processing uh you know you sign up for square uh get credit card processing through into it wave who we do our accounting through also offers credit card processing your clients are going to pay you with a credit card or debit card the overwhelming majority of the time um and so a you want to have something where you can send them an online online invoice all the services i just mentioned do that you want them to be able to pay it online with credit card or a debit card one of the reasons i say to get this set up now even if you don't have a customer is just think about it for a minute it's a little bit awkward if client number one calls you talks to you on the phone says okay i want you to build my app you tell them it's three thousand dollars and they say great send me an invoice and you don't even have your software set up yet to send them the invoice so in other words get your software set up now and your billing set up now and your credit card processing all set up now and you can send them the invoice right away it doesn't take long to get this stuff signed up so just get it done now there is no reason to be doing it later when you know when you need to send some to the client just get out of the way and sign up right now the next software next service i should say you're going to want to sign up is a payroll service we use the full service payroll offerings from intuit which is the parent company of quickbooks if you are starting an llc an s corp or uh an llc to be taxed as an s corp i should say or a corporation you're going to need to pay yourself as an employee and again the specifics of that or something to talk about with a lawyer but you are going to need to pay yourself as an employee in addition to taking distributions from the business and once you start doing payroll as an employee you'll find there is just a lot of paperwork that's got to be filed with the irs get filed with the state and your local governments and all that fun stuff by having a payroll service to do that for you you save a massive amount of time we pay a fee every month to intuit full service payroll and they take care of all of our paperwork for us i mean 100 of it and it just makes our life so much easier it is so worth the cost and it allows us to stay in compliance in terms of everything we need to be filing in terms of payroll so there are other services you're going to need to sign up for and other software products you're going to need to sign up for but the ones i would stress immediately to make sure you're ready to roll with are again your business suites this is g suite office 365 zoho any of those companies that have similar offerings excuse me your accounting software we use wave but again there's offerings such as quickbooks online uh freshbooks and several others sign up for a credit card processor such as with uh stripe wave square uh into a cr into it credit card processing any of those and the fourth one um on that list is to get signed up for a payroll service i just cannot stress all those things enough the next thing you're going to want to do as part of your administrative task getting going this is the fourth thing on our list remember first one was get your company an entity formed and know your licensing requirements second one was get your business address third one was get your bank account set up fourth one i'm i'm sorry so fourth one was your software and services fifth thing you're going to want to do is uh get your contracts ready these are the contracts you're going to send to customers so in other words let's say i'm your customer i call you i say i want you to build an app for me and then uh you give me a quote me three thousand dollars i say great send me over a contract so i can sign it this is a form contract that you will send me or mostly form contract at least that you would send me to for me to sign agreeing that you're going to do the work and what i'm going to pay you and so on so forth there are places you can get these types of contracts such as legalzoom there are problems with just getting forms off the internet though they may not be the right call for your situation it is very much worth the money to pay a small business lawyer to look over some for form contracts for you and give you some feedback and help you make sure you're on the right track in terms of the forms you're sending off to potential clients to sign so you know like i said you can pull a form off of legalzoom my strong advice would be to talk to an attorney though and have them go over any contracts uh that you may be thinking of putting in your document bank to send the clients and then you know once the attorneys reviewed them you know you can start sending them off and because contracts are so important in your business what we're going to do is at the end of this section of our video we're going to have a separate lecture from an attorney named carrie ross carrie is a business law attorney in the dayton ohio area and she's been kind enough to put together some information on things to look out for and to make sure of when you're putting together the contracts the next thing and last thing on my list to sign up for and this is item number seven is insurance for your business uh specifically professional liability insurance what this is some what this does i should say is it allows you to be protected from liability in the event that one of your customers ever sues you so let's say you know a customer hires you to build a website and they say hey you know you did something wrong as a result they don't appear in search engines or um you know they hire you to build an app and they claim you did something wrong and they lost business as a result of it and then they want to sue you having insurance it means that you could just turn the lawsuit over to your insurance even if you don't agree with the lawsuit again your insurance will cover it and your insurance would pay all your legal bills i mean we've never been sued in our business but given a really small cost of carrying insurance it just lets me sleep better at night so i think right now our premiums just went up so right now we're paying call it a hundred dollars a year it's really not very much at all in the grand scheme of things so sign up for professional liability insurance um for your business uh just call geico or you know any similar company and they can get you pointed in the right direction as to who you want to sign up for with that so your administrative tasks again to get out of the way before you even start taking customers are get your company formed and know your legal requirements get a business address get a business bank account get your required or needed software and services signed up get uh your contracts that you're going to be sending clients ironed out preferably reviewed by an attorney and also get an insurance policy signed up and as i mentioned a moment ago let's get to attorney kerry ross for her lecture on contracts in your business hi my name is carrie ross i'm a business attorney and an estate planning attorney with ross legal services in dayton ohio i've been asked to speak with you today about the importance of written contracts in your software development business we're going to talk about a few key points in this segment first the importance generally of wellwritten contracts throughout all aspects of your business and then specifically in connection with your software development services second we'll talk about typical formats for development service contracts and some key provisions that you may want to include in your form to use with your clients last we'll talk about some resources available to you for purposes of preparing your contract to use with your clients the first thing i'll say is having a wellwritten contract is very important for all aspects of your business you might be entering into a lease for office space employment agreements hiring your own independent contractors or simply purchasing goods in each case review the contract negotiate it make sure that the final product matches what your intentions are so that the contract cannot be questioned a purpose of a contract is to memorialize your business transaction it's your reference guide throughout an ongoing transaction if there's a question about who's obligated to do what and when it's also your first line of defense in the event of a dispute your contract may even have provisions that say what to do in the event of a dispute do you have to go to arbitration for example or are there notice requirements before you can take any kind of legal action when not reduced to writing a handshake deal or something you've agreed to via email or if it's just poorly written in a written contract you're open to disputes he said she said problems coming up down the road including maybe not getting paid maybe having to sue someone or being sued for breach of contract or maybe additional damages and sometimes it's all of the above a real world example in the software development field would be if you agreed to develop an app for a customer and it has certain functionality delivery dates you comply with all of that at the end of the agreement once you've delivered your app and been paid you're asked to provide ongoing maintenance and rather than memorializing the terms of that specifically in a contract you think that everything's gone well with this customer you agree to provide maintenance two or three years go by and all of a sudden the technology on which your app was based is being phased out it no longer functions and your client is looking to you to say g as part of your maintenance maybe you need to rebuild the entire app and you may say well that wasn't in the scope of the maintenance agreement so where do you look you look at your written contract and if you haven't memorialized the terms of that clearly you could be left in a lurch so at this point let's turn our attention to the typical format for software development contracts and some key provisions you may want to include so as we discussed in the last section your written contract with your customer is going to be the place where you protect your business's interest and in the context of app development or software development you're protecting you your talent is what's delivering the project and the product at the end of the day so that's really what your contract is geared to protect clients will ask you to provide a contract nine times out of ten unless you're working with the microsoft's or amazons or large development houses of the world your clients will not normally have their own development contract form so you want to be prepared when you make that sales pitch in advance so that you're not holding up your sales process or closing your deal because you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with your own contract if a client does present you with their own form it's really important to read this closely understand what you're agreeing to before you finalize it you may not feel like you have that much leverage and you may not but as long as you know what you're signing ahead of time and make sure that it's not going to impact your activities going forward then that's important things to watch out for would be restrictive covenants that prevent you from creating the same or similar software or applications for people in competing industries so noncompetes nonsolicitations those types of things should really be watch outs the common format that i typically see for services agreements is an independent contractor agreement plus a statement of work that is attached to the back of it you can call it an independent contractor agreement you can call it a services agreement software development agreement that really doesn't matter as much as the fact that you're going to have your general basic terms that stay for the most part the same from customer to customer in your independent contract agreement and this attachment on the back where you can customize the transaction to match what you're actually being asked to perform common provisions that you would see within the independent contractor section clearly you're going to identify the parties the date you're signing the agreement in each of these right off the bat but in the contractor agreement section you'll cover things like termination rights who has the right to end the contract for what reasons and what procedures in place when that happens do you get paid for partially completed work or how does that work things like insurance indemnification obligations where you're risk sharing with the other side in case something goes wrong those would be negotiated in your independent contractor agreement if you're granting any warranties for your work or specifically saying you're not granting warranties for your work that's typically handled in this section as well a word of caution there depending on where you are most state statutes have specific requirements that imply certain warranties unless you disclaim them specifically and if you are going to disclaim them you may have to write that in a certain way in your agreement to make it enforceable so please check in with local council or really do some statutory research if you have that available to you to make sure you're complying with the restrictions you may also handle things such as the venue for any lawsuits that potentially come up governing law that would apply to your contract particularly if you're located in different states than your customer or alternative dispute resolution provisions that may require arbitration or mediation prior to starting a lawsuit now the statement of work is the juicy part this is where you get to customize the work or customize the language to match the work you're performing so you really want to get into the deliverables here in specific detail what are your deliverables and when are you expected to deliver them is this a pretty specific project that's due all at one time is it a phased timeline for delivery what is due when and what are your obligations related to that payment terms you want to make sure that you're specifically saying when you want to get paid and for what if you're delivering parts of the project along a timeline will you get paid as those things get delivered do you get paid on an hourly rate a flat fee rate what are the terms of your payment and when are they due and keep in mind if this is your form start where you want the payment terms to start and let your customer negotiate a change from there if needed you may want to deal with specifically customer responsibilities depending on what you're doing you may need the customer or a customer representative assigned to you to provide you with information or access to systems to make sure their app works what happens if they don't do that and that delay is your timeline are you responsible or are they responsible here is also the place where you deal with ongoing obligations after the ultimate project is delivered will you be maintaining the project are you responsible for updates for the project do you have any kind of other ongoing application or i'm sorry ongoing obligation uh after the delivery is done so these are the kinds of things that you're going to want to really nail down inside of your independent contractor agreement and the attached scope of work so now we've gone over the need for written contracts throughout your business and we've specifically talked about the format you may want to use and some provisions that you might include in your software development agreement to be used with your own clients this may seem pretty overwhelming at this point a lot to think about the good news is there are some resources available to help you as you start to develop your own form the first and most obvious choice is to contact an attorney to help prepare the contract on your behalf you can explain your needs what the contract will be used for and have the attorney prepare that with those views in mind this may not be in your budget i understand that it is possible to negotiate a flat fee with a lot of attorneys which may save you some money over an hourly rate arrangement it may also be possible to negotiate a reduced rate for a startup business if this is still not within your budget i would encourage you to contact your local chamber of commerce or if you have like we do in dayton a small business startup incubator firm you might be able to contact them and receive some free or reduced cost professional services including legal services and others such as accounting banking etc through their programming if that's not available in your area there are numerous internet resources that you can use to start a form such as nolo.com might be a good starting point you can find these forms and i keep stressing starting point because as i mentioned in the previous segment there are specific statutory requirements depending on what kind of services you'll be offering and what you want your contract to cover i would encourage all of you to at least have an attorney read your form remembering that this is an investment in your business that you'll be using hopefully over and over again with your clients if you have any questions about anything we've covered here please feel free to contact me directly good luck okay a big thanks to kerry for talking about the importance of contracts and what to look for in a written contract now let's talk about what you need to be doing to market your new business okay now that you're ready to start up as a freelance developer let's talk about some things you need to get out of the way immediately so that you'll be able to market your business properly and there are other items other than the ones i'm going to talk about which you'll need however these are just the ones i'm stressing in this video some of them may seem obvious but you would be surprised how many people decide to open up their doors without having all these items for lack of a better word ready to go so let's go over a few things to make sure you have you know before you start trying to market yourself to customers number one is you need a website for your new business number two is need a branded email you need a phone number uh you need to have business cards you need to sign up your various review profiles on uh websites such as google my business and yelp and things of that nature you need to flush out your linkedin profile and again these are just some of the musthaves i mean obviously there are other ones so let's go through each of these in turn number one start a start a website for your new development business you would be surprised i have actually seen people who go out and hold themselves out as freelance software developers freelance web developers and they haven't they have not actually put up a website for themselves or if they have just to be frank it looks like garbage so put up something nice um your website is important for multiple reasons number one it's essentially your storefront right think of it like this if you were going to hire somebody to build you a website would you be a little concerned if they didn't have a nice website for themselves of course you would so have a website up for yourself before you start trying to hustle up business and make it nice make it look like you actually know what you're doing make it look like it's something you actually care about if you're looking for inspiration or patterns or even some good foundational templates to use for a website for yourself i would suggest going to the website html5 up these are free html5 templates that again are pretty good to use uh you know if you want to just get something up quicker and sooner rather than later again that website is html5 up or at a minimum you know if that's at a minimum i should say or build yourself something really nice from the ground up again this is you showing off yourself as a developer so have a website and make sure it looks nice number two is a branded email for your business um you gotta realize as a freelance developer you're gonna be dealing with a lot of people who can barely use a computer or barely use their newfangled smartphone so you know having a branded email goes a long way towards validating you with people um if you email somebody from you know your name at gmail.com you might as well be emailing them from brand new developer at gmail.com it goes a long way towards legitimizing you having a branded email we talked a little bit in the last section about signing up a business suite such as g suite or office 365 you'll get a branded email as part of that but don't start emailing potential clients and interacting with potential clients from um you know a free email account such as gmail yahoo you know outlook.com or anything like that the third thing to get is a phone number dedicated to your business there are a lot of reasons uh to keep your cell phone and your business line separate do you want your personal number on your website probably not uh there do you want to be able to go out at night and have your phone ring and not be sure if it's a customer or if it's just a friend of yours or a family member calling i'm sure you would like to be able to separate your work in your business lines fortunately having a separate business phone number doesn't require you to go out and pay for a second cell phone you certainly can if you want but you don't have to you can use a free service from google called google voice and that will allow you to essentially have a free voice over internet line that will go to your cell phone so you'll basically have two numbers on your cell phone google voice again is free you know you can talk and text talk text make calls from it receive calls um you know uh my wife has a google voice line uh for her business on her phone and it's free it's easy to use i mean i would suggest for uh your business phone number uh using google voice uh the next thing you're going to want to get is business cards you're going to be dealing especially as a freelance developer you're going to be dealing with or are likely i should say to be dealing with a good number of local businesses and it is important to be able to hand them a business card uh with that being said i personally don't think it's worth it to spend a lot of money on your business cards you can get something that's adequate from vistaprint you know usually 50 bucks for a few hundred cards uh but having a business card that you can hand out is definitely important you will be surprised at how many people say to you oh okay do you have a card and you looks kind of silly if you don't have a business card to hand them so have your business cards with you and you know like ready to roll before you even start trying to hustle up business the next thing you're going to want to do is get your various review profiles lined up these are your profiles on websites such as yelp um the review section of the facebook page for your new business uh the review section on google my business and things like that these are places where uh your customers will leave you good reviews you're going to want to ask them for reviews we'll talk about that a little later but as i said these are places for your customers to leave you good reviews after you've completed work for them it's important that you get these review profiles signed up and they be proactive about getting reviews from customers because there are there are meaningful number of people who will not want to hire you unless they can find good reviews um about your services and the reason i say to get your review profile signed up before you even get your first customer is because then you are ready to ask that customer for a review you don't want to you know finish your first customer's project and then you know and then um not be in a position to ask them for reviews because you haven't even signed up the profiles yet so before you even start going out and trying to hustle up business get your review profiles signed up the primary ones i would focus on are again google my business yelp uh the review section of your facebook page um you know those would probably be the big ones uh the next thing is to completely flush out and uh uh come and uh kind of make your linkedin profile look really nice and complete make it really clear what skills you have uh you know hey you know if you hey i know css i know javascript i know html you know i'm fluent in other languages make sure those are all listed on your linkedin profile make sure your linkedin profile says that you are available for uh freelance work any certifications you've gotten from free code camp make sure your list those are listed on your linkedin profile there are also quick certification tests you can take from linkedin for example uh they have one for css uh only takes a few minutes to do maybe a half hour to do the test and you'll have a note citation on your linkedin page saying that you're you're considered certified in css and if as i said have your profile say that you're available for freelance work and you'll be surprised at how many people just start randomly reaching out to you through linkedin um you know for potential freelance work and also link even if someone's not reaching out to you linkedin is a place where people are going to look to validate you in addition to looking at the review profiles i mentioned a minute ago so those are the initial musthaves in terms of being ready to market your new business again just going through them real fast in order get a website up go to a website such as html5 up if you're looking for inspiration or for a quick template you can grab get a branded email again g suite office 365 zoho those kinds of services uh are going to give you that anyway get a phone number for your business uh dedicated to your business uh i would suggest using google voice that's what my wife uses in her business i've used it in the past it's free so i don't really see any reason starting out to pay for something get business cards again something from vistaprint is typically fine get your review profiles signed up uh you know we're talking about uh yelp the facebook review section google my business and get your linkedin profile completely fleshed out and nicely filled out and you do those things and you're in a good spot to start marketing start i gotta stress marketing your business so with all that said let's talk about why the last stage of getting your business officially started is to begin a process of lifelong learning and then we'll be done with this module okay so the last part of getting your business started is recognizing that you are now going to have to be a lifelong learner if you want to be a successful freelancer and what do i mean by this i mean the fact that successful business people are always trying to learn about new topics uh rel that in some way relate to their business it is a mistake to think that okay i'm you know finishing or i have finished uh the coding education i'm going to do at free code camp and i'm now done and i'm ready to strike out into the world completing free code camp is not the end of uh learning how to code it is the beginning of starting a career as a coder in other words it is just the first step and now you've got to start learning about a whole lot of other topics if you want to be successful as a freelancer because what you will quickly find out and when i say quickly i mean almost immediately find out once you go out on your own is that there is a whole lot of things that going to be go into being a business person uh besides learning how to code so one thing i cannot stress to you enough is um in your spare time just be reading on a regular basis uh you know try to read 30 to 45 minutes a day at a at a minimum and i gotta stress the at a minimum and when i say read i don't mean um you know just random articles and magazines or fiction books or whatever uh i would really suggest trying to learn um as much as you can about people who have been very successful in their fields look at what traits made them successful and then try to emulate those traits in your own business and there's also just a lot of other books you can read that help you figure out what it is that successful people do in terms of the habits they keep the thing i can't stress enough is that you would when you read about successful people and people who have achieved a lot what you will see is common patterns common behaviors and common habits between all of them and it is important to remember that those people don't have those habits because they're successful they're successful because they have those habits so if you choose to have those habits in your own business and in your own life you can be successful as well so my my advice is just read early read often um about people who have been successful in their field and it doesn't even have to be a successful software developer like bill gates i mean just people who have been successful in any kind of business a few books i would suggest to get started with if you haven't read these already number one is profit first what this is is a book that talks about essentially accounting in your business but also how to set up a financial budget for your business a lot of businesses go out of go out of business due to poor financial management and now that you're a freelancer you are a business person like it or not and you don't want your business to fail due to poor financial management profit first does a pretty good job of putting together a system that is easy for people to follow um so if you're somebody who already has a lot of discipline and is already really good with managing finances and you're good at keeping personal and business finances separate on top of that this may not be the book for you but that being said i am willing to put a large number of people watching this video would be open to admitting that they've struggled with personal financial management at some point so reading profit first is good in a sense that it will give you an easy to follow system and just follow the system and your business's finances will take care of themselves so profit first is book number one book number two is how to win friends and influence people this is a good one to read because it really goes a long way in terms of giving some tips that can be useful in dealing with potential customers dealing with people after they've become your customers dealing with other vendors and just individuals you're going to have to deal with in the business world on you know just on a daily basis while the book isn't specifically about dealing with people in a business setting it really gives a lot of great information on how to deal with individuals in different situations in a broader context and if you're somebody that feels like how do i endear myself to people how do i sell how do i make people want to hire me this is probably a good book to read so number two is how to win friends and influence people by dale carnegie number three is the millionaire next door this is a book in which many millionaires were studied over a long period of time and it'll really dispel a lot of common misperceptions about individuals who are millionaires how they became millionaires the habits of millionaires and things of that nature it'll also go a long way in showing how millionaires stay millionaires through certain financial habits i personally think this book should be required reading before anyone graduates from high school in the united states so it's one i certainly cannot suggest enough that people should be read reading number four is a small time operator this is a book that deals with small business in general um everything from habits you should be keeping uh in terms of financial management to daytoday operations to getting your taxes paid on time to you name it for anyone who has never worked for themself and is now going out as a freelance developer small time operator is a must read number four is the i'm sorry number five is the innovators by walter isaacson this is essentially a history of uh computing and computer science and it goes all the way from the creation of the first computer and the concepts of the first computer of ada lovelace all the way up through essentially where we are today and it'll really give you an appreciation of how no one person not even steve jobs not even bill gates not even name an individual no one person had an outsized impact on computing and has really just been kind of a brick by brick building of uh you know of uh computer science from the from its founding and through now and it really just gives you an appreciation of uh what what different individuals has done it's an inspiring book to read and i i just think it's a muslim must read for anyone who's just learned to code and is striking out on their own and the final book i would suggest reading is the everything store which is a story about amazon and the founding of amazon by jeff bezos and how the company grew uh to where it is today the thing you will really take away from this book when you read it is that amazon got where it is today in large part by a neverending focus on customer service i mean whether it's just you as a freelance developer you know in your basement writing code or whether you're jeff bezos writing amazon running amazon and everything in between customer service has to be your prep number one priority there's can be no other priority that comes before customer service and reading the everything store will really uh help you understand this so like i said these are just a few suggestions um to get started and i would really suggest reading 30 to 45 minutes a day um for those of you watching this video you know if we could line everybody up a year from now for people who have succeeded as a freelancer and people who haven't i guarantee you the people who have succeeded have probably read more consistently than the people who haven't so you know with all of that said let's move on to the next part of our lessons okay we're to the point of our lessons where we're going to talk about how to get clients for your new business after all as a freelance web developer freelance software developer you're not going to be in business very long if you don't have customers right so really we're going to look at a few things number one we're going to look at how to get customers in the short term because you need revenue today and number two we're going to look at how to build your business over the long term how you get customers over the long term is going to be very different than how you immediately get customers today for your short term startup business all right so before we dive into those let's look at number one why is it important to understand the difference between the long term and the short term and then let's quickly talk about how to sell your services to people once you understand the need to focus on the long term you'll see the difference between that and shortterm business building and then you'll also see that once you know how to sell yourself to people you can just be far more effective in terms of growing your business so first the need to focus on both the shortterm and the long term in your business the need to focus on the short term is obvious right because as i said a moment ago if you don't have customers today you're going to be in business for about 30 seconds so you need to get customers today no one disputes that you may not be taking your dream jobs you may not be getting the work that is your first choice but you need work so again you're gonna go about doing things to get work today that are getting you work through not necessarily the most uh how shall we say sustainable ways okay but again you need work today so that's what you're gonna do over the long term however you're going to build a brand meaning that you're going to build a business where instead of you going out and getting work through nonsustainable means people are just coming to you and you're getting the work without having to put much effort into getting it this is work that will be higher paying this is work more along the lines of what you want to be doing long term and more importantly if you're not putting time and resources into getting that work it becomes much more profitable for you so if you only focus on the short term you can get some business and that's what you're going to have to do in the beginning but if that is your sole focus and you're confident you're just constantly and i do mean constantly in that state of trying to hustle up new work looking for the next job things of that nature and you just never really get your business out of second gear if however you keep your focus on building a longterm brand you grow your profits in your business really fast so that's why it's important to in the short term go out and get some clients do what you have to do to hustle up work but also be building a longterm brand so i cannot stress that enough number two is how to actually sell yourself to customers and eat whether you're trying to sell the people in the short term or whether you're trying to sell the people in the long term i cannot stress enough that you need to view yourself as a problem solver we talked about this in an earlier section of the video when we were talking about the need to provide value to your clients when you are selling yourself to your clients and trying to sell your services to a client what you need to do is come to learn about the client's business and identify the client's problems and explain how your software is or your website or whatever you're building explain how your product is going to solve those problems okay don't come to them and say here's my experience here's what i've done say you have this problem here's how i'm going to solve it people are going to be much much much and i mean much more receptive to that kind of an approach and you'll wind up doing a lot more in sales this is something i talked about at length in a previous video for free code camp and we're going to link to that video in the description below so we don't rehash too much of it here but when selling yourself to customers i cannot stress enough present yourself as a problem solver so in short you need customers in the short term we're going to talk in a moment about how to get those it's important that you keep a focus on building your brand long term and when selling yourself to customers it's really important that you present yourself as a solver of their problems all right so with all that said let's get on to how to build your business over the short term okay let's take a few minutes to talk about some things you're going to do to get clients in the short term as we just said in our intro the need to get clients in the short term for your freelance business is obvious right because after all if you don't get clients immediately you're not going to be working for yourself for very long so in just a moment i'm going to get into five different ways that you can go about getting clients immediately getting customers today and generating some revenue before i get into that though the one thing i want to stress is that the things you're going to do in the short term to get clients are going to be a little more labor intensive and a little more costly than the things you're going to do over the long term to get your business and that's all right again these things like i said while they in the short term while they may be costly while they may be time intensive the bottom line is they're necessary because if you don't have clients today you are not going to do that very well and you're not going to be around for very long so let's look at five things you can do in the short term to get clients for your startup business number one is simply gonna be people you know and i'll talk about this in a minute you're just gonna put put out there to people you know that you're now engaging in this kind of work number two is to be lead websites such as upwork and fiverr we'll talk about those in a minute number three is going to be leveraging your linkedin profile number four and people are surprised when i say this is going to be leveraging websites such as craigslist and number five is gonna be good oldfashioned networking so let's go through each of these in turn number one is as i said just putting your name out there to people you know you would be surprised at how much work you can get by simply making everyone you know aware of the fact that you are now engaging in this type of work i'm not suggesting that you go around the friends and family members and continuously harass them into letting you do build them a website or letting you do something for them what i'm saying though is that you need to simply put out there hey just so you know i'm available to do this type of work let me give you a few examples of what i mean by that in one of our businesses our main service is building websites for very small to mediumsized companies and usually you know kind of like the small momandpop shops type companies so just as an example when we started that business i made i just kind of casually mentioned to one friend of mine hey just so you know we're going to be doing this type of work you know like etc etc if you know anybody that needs that kind of work just let me know and very quickly that friend said to me that her her mother had actually recently started a church and then we wound up building a website for the church i also mentioned to a neighbor that i was doing this type of work and very quickly that led to another referral the same thing and i had similar situations with other people that we knew so when i told people hey we do this kind of work that was going to be the only time i tell them i'm not going to like sit there and tell them over and over i'm not going to like harass them i'm not going to sit there and say just a reminder i do this kind of work just casually make people aware that you're doing this type of work and do it in a way where you don't sound like you're trying to sell them something again hey just letting you know and you will be surprised how quickly referrals can come in that way as i said we started that little side project business i just talked about and very quickly we started getting referrals simply by letting people i know know that we were doing this kind of work so just putting yourself out there like that can go a long way and i can't stress that enough as a place to start the second place to look for getting clients for your business is lead service websites such as upwork and fiverr what up work is it's a website where essentially people looking for services such as web development or software development will go on upwork state what it is they want and what they're willing to pay and then you can go online and bid on the job a lot of times you'll be bidding on work at a dollar amount for which is way less than what you would normally charge for this kind of work but again in the beginning it's work so you know it can generate some revenue for you while you're getting started the thing that i would say is important to do when you're using websites such as upwork from tac things of that nature is to make sure that your profile on the site is fully completed make sure you list all your experience include examples of your work and um things of that nature make sure make sure people review you on those sites after they're happy with your services all those kinds of things will make your bidding process more effective so the upside of these kinds of services is the fact that people go on there looking for the services you're providing so it makes finding a customer a lot easier the downside is again you're working for a reduced rate a lot of the time and you're also paying for the lead so it's not going to be the most profitable thing in the world but in the short term it is work to do and it is money to be made another option as i mentioned a second ago is fiverr fiverr works a little different than a website such as upwork what fiverr is is you essentially go online create a profile people can come to your profile and say what they're willing to pay and then fiverr will take a cut of that so again you're usually going to wind up working for reduced rates on a website such as fiber and on top of that you're paying a percentage to fiber so when you're looking at those kinds of things it's important to consider the reduced profitability weight against the fact that the customers are typically being or essentially i should say being brought to you so again pros and cons on those third thing on our list is leveraging linkedin it's really important to on your linkedin profile make sure that you are stating that you are a freelance developer that you work for yourself put the name of your business on there and make sure you list in your bio and in your bylines that you are available to do this kind of work on a freelance basis make sure you're including all your qualifications uh include examples of your work on your linkedin profile and there is such a shortage right now of software developers and web developers that you will be surprised at how many people will reach out to you and ask if you are available to do work for them so linkedin is a good way uh to get business again just as i said make sure your profile is filled out all the way on there number four and this is one that people kind of raise an eyebrow when i say it is to have a nice ad on your local craigslist section so for example if you live in name of city go on the name of city page for craigslist and you know under certain the services section you can put in that you are available to do web design or whatever kind of work it is you're doing don't just put up a quick craigslist post saying that hey i do this work call me at this number actually take the time write out a nice ad put it on craigslist include a graphic uh the craigslist supports a graphic uh at a width of 450 pixels at a height of 600 pixels put a nice graphic on there put as i said a nice ad on there and you will be surprised at the fact that you get some calls through there to this day craigslist remains a highly valuable and highly underutilized resource for getting work now the work you're going to get through craigslist is not going to be the most profitable type of work there is these are typically going to be low dollar websites um you know people want to spend a few bucks for just some basic coding or something like that again it's not you're certainly not going to get rich off it's not going to be all the money in the world but it only costs you five dollars to run the ad and you will get some work out of that the important thing is to post consistently and to stick with it the last thing on our list is good oldfashioned networking and by networking i mean going out and meeting with other business owners to drum up work for yourself what i don't suggest for networking is going doortodoor or going around at different kinds of businesses trying to introduce yourself i also don't suggest going to functions that are mostly attended by other developers that is something i see in a lot of different professions so for example attorneys tend to network with other attorneys uh you know accountants tend to network with other accountants a lot of software developers tend to network with other software developers and to be honest that's just not a very effective way of leveraging networking into getting customers instead what you want to be doing is meeting with people who in turn work with your customers so for example if you are let's say starting up a freelance web design business and what you might want to do is get hooked up with a digital marketer who doesn't actually do web design but maybe manages payperclick or something for somebody those type of people are almost always looking for people to build websites on behalf of their clients so that would in turn be a good referral source for you one of the best ways or i should say best resources to find good networking opportunities is a group called bni that's business networking international they're throughout the united states and with lots of local chapters and pretty much everywhere so go on bni's website and find local chapters in your area and join up there is an annual fee for joining bni it is well worth it the idea of bni is has a few aspects to it number one is they only allow one person in a chapter per an area so for example if you join bni as a web designer they're not going to allow another web designer in that chapter so which a lot gives you some exclusivity and for obvious reasons is good for you and then you'll have a chapter with one web designer one auto mechanic one accountant one finance manager one local doctor just name that one real estate agent just name the type of business and he will have one of each in there and then once you attend it and then you'll attend weekly meetings and once you attend these weekly meetings the goal of bni is for everybody in the group to essentially open up their referral books to one another so in other words you are a web designer in the bni group friend of yours needs an auto mechanic you refer them to the auto mechanic in the bni group the auto mechanic nobody knows somebody who needs their house painted so he refers them to the house painter in the bni group it turns out that there's a doctor in the or you know physician in the bni group and it turns out he knows somebody that needs a website he just refers the site he refers them to you so in other words it's not something where person one and person two are directly referring things to each other all the time it's just that everybody in the group is referring things to other people in a group and a lot of that business will have a way of coming back to you so attending a networking group such as bni is a really good start for a way to get business in the short term networking can be very very time consuming so that is why i've got it on our list of things to do to build business in the short term it is a very time consuming so a lot of people like to say well i go out and i network because it's free well it's only free if you value your time at zero okay and your time is worth a whole lot more than zero so in the short term networking functions and networking events and joining networking groups is an okay way to get business but as you build a brand long term those are things that you're going to want to get away from so to sum up we're really talking about five ways to build business and grow your company over the short term number one is people you know as i said just put it out there that you're doing this kind of work you know uh don't harass your friends it's a good way to make sure they're not your friends anymore number two excuse me is using services such as upwork thumbtack and fiverr number three is leveraging linkedin number four is a website such as craigslist and number five is good oldfashioned networking so now that we've gone over all of those let's talk about how it is you're gonna build your brand over the long term which will greatly increase your profits okay let's talk about building your business over the long term now and having a longterm sustainable business is going to look a lot different than the things you're doing to get business in the short term as we talked about in the last section of our video your shortterm business activities are really going to focus on using lead websites going to networking events things that are either very expensive things that are very time consuming things that lead to you taking work at reduced rates those are all good ways to make a few bucks today to keep your new business running and to help you make a little extra money while you're focusing on building a longterm brand the reason why building a longterm brand is so important is having an actual brand that you have ownership and control of allows you to number one charge more for your services you'll actually be charging more of what you deserve to be making for the work you're doing number two it also allows you to save time and resources on getting work in other words instead of you putting out money instead of you putting out a lot of time to get work people are going to be coming to you so think of it like this people coming to you and saying let me pay you full price as opposed to you going to people and saying here's uh reduced work i can do so for obvious reasons having a brand is way way way and a whole bunch of ways more profitable than the things you're going to need to do in the short term so while you're engaging in those short term activities that we talked about in the our last section i cannot stress enough that you need to be making time for the long term activities that were about to talk about and if you don't make time for those longterm activities next thing you know you've been freelancing and working for yourself for five years and you are still engaging in those shortterm activities and not making very much money that can be a trap that is actually very easy for people to fall into so the best thing you can do is just set aside the time every week to say you know what i don't care how busy i am i'm going to focus on these longterm activities so what are the longterm activities that you're going to engage in to make sure you're building a brand and that you're charging more for your services and that you're not putting time and effort into getting customers number one is simply building a referral base and we'll talk about that in a second number two is going to be leveraging a blog for yourself and number three is going to be leveraging platforms such as youtube if you focus on these three things then next thing you know like i said people are coming to you instead of you going to them and people are paying you more instead of less so let's look at each of these in term again number one is simply getting referrals from people and getting repeat business referrals and repeat business i'm saying that so saying that so many times because it's so important it's so important i'm going to say it again referrals and repeat business here's the important thing to understand about getting referrals from former customers and having other former customers come back to you to do additional work in the future when you look at very successful businesses they don't get a proportionately higher number of phone calls and what i mean by that is let's say you've got developer one and developer two here's developer one here's developer two this developer does five times the revenue every year of this developer let's go with 5x that does not mean that this developer gets five times as many brand new client calls every month as this developer if you want to get to where you are making substantially more than other people you have to do it by getting referrals from former customers and getting repeat business from former customers it is simply too expensive and too time consuming to constantly be getting brand new business that's not stemming from work you have already done it's just not possible to succeed without doing that think of it in these terms a customer comes to you wants a website you build it for three thousand dollars right you do a really good job for that customer three to six months later that customer refers you to somebody you then build that person a website for twenty five hundred dollars three to six months later that second customer the referred one they refer you somebody you build that one website for say three thousand dollars your marketing or whatever you're doing to get clients from the outside world only yielded one phone call it yielded the phone call from the very first customer however by doing good work that one customer turned into three new customers or i'm sorry two new customers and a total of three customers and as a result of that you also have three potential referral sources out there right now all from one phone call right and some of that can also happen with repeat business and so on so forth in other words if you get one phone call you do a great job for the person and over the course of three or four years you know you do three or four different projects for that person one phone call yielded three or four different jobs essentially so that kind of an approach and focusing on referrals and repeat business is the way to grow your business exponentially so how do you make sure you're getting referrals and repeat business well it may sound simple but you'd be surprised the first thing is good oldfashioned customer service call people back return respond to people's emails be honest with them about how long something is going to take do what you're say you're going to do if you tell somebody you're going to have something done by thursday have it done by thursday if you're not going to have it done by thursday make sure you call them thursday and or email them thursday and explain to them that this isn't done i'm sorry here's why it's not done here's when it will be done don't make them chase you around saying hey you said this was going to be done on thursday where is it good oldfashioned customer service and saying that that what you're going to do and doing it are the most surefire ways to lead to that repeat business and those referrals that we just talked about i cannot stress this enough you may think duh when i'm saying provide good service to people but you would be surprised at how few people out there actually provide the kind of service that you would probably want to receive yourself so going that extra mile going above and beyond can really go a long way and as simple as that sounds it takes work to you got to remember it takes work to provide good customer service right so do that work and put in the time and you will be shocked at how fast your business grows um and this is true whatever industry you're in whether you're a freelance developer of some sort whether you're a real estate agent whether you are you know an accountant or some other type of professional i just cannot stress enough good service leads to a whole lot more business and that is how you grow your business exponentially through referrals and repeat business so that's number one number two for building your freelance business over the long term is leveraging a blog and by this i mean you need to be blogging regularly attach your blog to your website you need to be blogging regularly on issues important to your customer base one of the big mistakes a lot of people make with a blog is they start writing on things that they think are interesting the focus of your blog needs to be providing useful information to your customer base and this is something i see all the time like for example i have on our blog on our business for our business which deals primarily with software answers for law firms we have provided a lot of information about how law firms can be more efficient in their daytoday operations we've written a lot of information about how they can leverage different software applications in a law firm and so on so forth attorneys doing google searches on making their practices more efficient then land on those articles and they explore our blog further when they start to look at some of the solutions we provide they realize that they may need our services and they pick up the phone and call us so in other words by providing useful information to our customer base through a blog our customer base lands on our website they then turn and they in turn then call us so leveraging a blog that provides useful information to your customers is one of the best ways to get business and this winds up being incredibly time effective there are blog posts that i wrote three four five even in some instances even six years ago that are still yield still yielding phone calls to our business today so in other words a couple hours to write a blog post five years ago people are still calling us because we own it no one can take it away from us okay that is incredibly time effective in terms of going out and getting a business in addition to a blog another great source to leverage is youtube uh youtube is one of the most popu actually one of the most popular search engines in the world people go on youtube all the time looking for information if you're gonna do a youtube channel to drum up business the thing i cannot stress enough is just like with a blog provide information that is useful to people so again provide information that your potential customers are looking for so for example let's say you want to focus on websites for small businesses which is something we do in one of our businesses i'm just using this as an example i want to build websites for small businesses i start a youtube channel on it a lot of small businesses might be trying to do their own website say with wix or like wordpress or something like that and then they'll get frustrated with it and maybe decide to call a developer so what we can do in our business is do a youtube channel on how to's like here's how to do x in your wix website here's how to do why in your wordpress website and then those small businesses start to use our youtube channel as a resource to meet their needs and over time when they realize that wix and wordpress actually can't meet their meet their needs fully or their needs go beyond wix or wordpress they then turn around and call us because we're the people they've been getting information from this whole time so again providing useful information to people is the best way to leverage a youtube channel so doing these three things i've just talked about really again i can't stress enough allows you to build a brand it results in people coming to you instead of you going out hustling up work and it allows you to charge more for your work so while you're growing your business in the short term and while you're doing the things you need to do to get clients in the short term the things you need to be focusing on is making sure you're building a referral base and a repeat business base and you do that by providing the absolute highest levels of customer service meeting your deadlines and doing the things you say you're going to do you want to leverage a blog again while you're busy in your business you need to make sure you're setting aside time to blog and that you're writing on issues that are answering your clients questions addressing your clients concerns and providing the kind of information your potential clients are looking for you want to apply that same approach to the third thing which is a youtube channel and again providing value and usefulness to people is the best way to make sure that they are excuse me that they are potentially interested in calling you if you do these three things you start to see yourself as i said having a brand that in turn leads to more leads to much more money it also leads to you having much more time because you're not doing things like going to networking events and the other things that you have to do to get business in the short term so with all of that said let's move on to the next part of our video which is how to go about managing your business on a daytoday basis okay we're on to the part of our video where we're going to talk about managing your business on a daytoday basis and we're going to break that down into two parts first we're going to talk about managing your administrative tasks on a daytoday basis and by administrative tasks i mean anything that is not actually related to development things such as filing your businesses taxes doing your bookkeeping filing paperwork with your secretary of state so on so forth so managing those kinds of tasks and the second thing we'll talk about will be managing your substantive work on a daytoday basis and your substantive work is the actual development work and you want to make sure you're doing that in a way that yields as much profit as possible so we'll talk about administrative and substantive and how to make sure you're managing yourself now before we get into those two things the biggest point i want to stress is that it's time for you to start thinking of yourself as a business person it's really common for me to have conversations with selfemployed individuals who will say something like well i'm not a business person i'm a software developer or i'm not a business person i'm a real estate agent or i'm not a business person i'm an attorney or something like that once you start working for yourself if you take the attitude of you know i'm not a business person i'm an ex then you really don't need to worry about being a business person and i say that because you're going to be out of business so fast that the problem of being a business person will take care of itself and when i say that i don't mean it to sound to flip but it really is true and the people who succeed as freelance developers and essentially and eventually i should say grow their freelance business into a real business are the ones who understand that as soon as you strike out on your own whether you have one customer whether you're running microsoft you are now in business for yourself okay so you need to understand that things like working efficiently and dealing with your administrative tasks those aren't optional these are things you're going to have to do and you just don't have a choice in the matter anymore and that is a choice you made once you decided to strike out on your own so understand that you are a business person doing so will one allow you to stay in business and to allow you to make a lot more money so with all that said let's move on to how to manage your administrative affairs on a daytoday basis okay so we're going to talk about the importance of dealing with your business's administrative affairs on a daytoday basis and the reason i am talking about this first before i get into talking about how to manage your substantive work is that the administrative work is a crucial topic to address lots and lots and lots and a whole bunch of lots of businesses especially freelance developers get themselves in trouble not because they're bad at development or they service their customers poorly it's because they do a really bad job at their administrative work and then that creates problems down the road for example suppose just as a hypothetical you need to file a document with the secretary of state and you fail to do so and you're right in the middle of a coding project for somebody and because you didn't file that document to secretary of state six months later while you're in the middle of that coding project a notice shows up from the secretary of state saying you've lost your right to legally do business so now you need to put that coding project on hold and take a day or two to deal with uh your administrative snafu as a result of this you miss a deadline to the customer the customer is unhappy uh you know obviously the customer is never going to refer you anybody the customer is never going to uh you know come back to you again for more work and that's just a simple example of how not dealing with administrative tasks can get in the way of you doing your substantive work and i totally understand that it's not fun to do administrative tasks right it's not fun to you know fill out stuff for the secretary of state it's not fun to do your bookkeeping it's not fun to do those kinds of things that's not why you signed up for free code camp that's not why you became a software developer in the first place but unfortunately those things are part of the job and if you don't pay attention to them failing to complete those administrative tasks timely and to handle them correctly will lead to problems with your actual substantive business okay so this is why i'm talking about the administrative tasks first so the first administrative issue i'm going to talk about in the management of your business is the biggest one and that's your daytoday financial management i could do easily a very long video course on how to manage your freelance business from a financial standpoint and because it would be so long i'm not going to dive into all of it now what i'm going to do is suggest you read a book which i suggested earlier in this course and that book is called profit first what profit first does is it lays out a framework which can manage your businesses finances for you so in other words it puts a framework in place you follow the framework and your business's finances kind of manage themselves at that point and financial management is one of the biggest things where a lot of people get themselves into trouble one of the biggest things you want to avoid is what's called bank balance accounting and lots of small business owners are guilty of this where they go online they look at their bank account they see a balance you know on the screen and they just assume that's that's how much money they have without any thought of you know what they've got to be paying what's coming out of it and so on so forth following the methodology laid out in profit first can a help you avoid bank balance accounting but also just help you make sure that your business is staying on path and in addition to reading profit first just remember that your businesses bank account is not your personal bank account you just can't go rate it whenever you want some money what you want to do is set up a system where you're only allowed to take a certain amount of money out of the business at any given time and a certain amount of money has to stay in the business at a given time and the profit first book really does a good job of laying all that out for you so if you can avoid financial mismanagement you will avoid a lot of the problems that or i should say administrative problems that get freelance developers into trouble and what i would suggest to you as an easy to use method for making sure you are following good financial management habits for your business is to read profit first and follow it again it's not enough to read the book you actually have to follow the methodology it's laying out for you the second big part in addition to following a methodology like the one in profit first to making sure that your finances are managed properly is to do your accounting regularly this is so important i cannot stress it enough do your accounting regularly you should be using bookkeeping software like wave or quickbooks or something of the sort in our business we use wave and i see way way way way way too many small businesses that don't do their books until the end of the year or even worse at the end of the year they essentially just print off all their bank statements and dump it on an accountant and say okay here figure out how much money i made last year well not doing the books in your business on a regular basis means you never actually know if you're making money or not and if you are making money how much you're making and if you're losing money how much you're losing and then it becomes easy for you to think well it seems like i'm doing good well seem can be a very tricky thing and you can get yourself in a lot of trouble by going off of how things seem what you need is objective data in front of you in other words you need a monthly statement showing here's how much money my business took in here's how much went out here's how much i've made here's how much i lost you've got to do your books on a regular basis if you get up and the first thing every day before you start work just do your bookkeeping for the day before in other words download the prior days transactions and reconcile them in your accounting software then you get in the habit of doing that and your books are just done all the time and it doesn't take more than a few minutes a day when you're just starting out if you have very few transactions at a minimum do your books once a week or at worst once a month but do your books on a regular basis i cannot stress this enough that is the only way you're actually going to know how much money you're making or how much money you're losing and what you need to adjust another benefit of doing your books on a regular basis is it also helps you catch expenses you might not realize you've signed up for that you're still paying so do your books regularly so in terms of managing your finances read profit first follow the methods laid out in profit first avoid using your personal bank account or i'm sorry your business's bank account as a piggy bank you can't just rate it whenever you want and the fourth part of managing your finances is doing your books daily so that's keeping your finances in order which again is one of the biggest administrative problems that a lot of freelancers run into and in terms of the second aspect of your administrative problems or administrative tasks i should say that you've got to manage on a daytoday basis that is just really all the different things that come with being a small business person too having to file your business license every year if you're in a state that requires that two having to file any documentation you need to file with county sales tax boards let's say you'll find that as an entrepreneur there is an endless flow of paperwork that you need to fill out and you need to stay on top of it so the best thing to do is don't take the approach of i'll do this later when a piece of paper comes across your desk and you look at it and you say oh okay i have to file something with the secretary of state just deal with it on the spot don't let these things pile up okay letting these kinds of tasks pile up is another of the big mistakes i see from entrepreneurs and again they might find out they've lost the ability to do business legally because they've let these things pile up if you just deal with them as soon as they come up then they're done you don't have to worry about them they're just taken care of and they probably don't even take that long what takes a long time is when you let these things grow into a stack this high and then you have to stop everything you're doing and spend days if not weeks dealing with all that stuff so deal with your administrative tasks as they come up just treat them as a priority that has to be dealt with because by getting them out of the way you can focus on the substantive work more okay so deal with those things immediately after they arise that is just something it is so important and if you do that you will have an advantage over other freelancers so in short if you want to get a leg up in your new business you got you have to take your administrative test seriously you have to manage your finances appropriately which cut which entails everything we just talked about reading profit first following the methods in it not rating your bank account doing your books on a regular basis and you have to deal with your administrative tasks as soon as they come up and if you need help with them retain a business lawyer to help you okay but if you do those things you prevent your administrative tasks from getting in the way of your actual business and then you make more money so with all that said let's get on to our accounting and financial management course from aaron lear

going to divide this up into three topics uh this first one's just going to be the real basics 101 second topic we're going to do a brief overview of your chart of accounts or your income and expense buckets and once you get inside your accounting software and then the third topic we're going to cover a profit and loss statement just kind of how to read it and what it looks like all right i hope you find this helpful and best of luck thanks okay so if there are just three things to do if you don't want to watch anything else past this just three things is number one keep your business and personal finances separate number two save at least 25 30 of your gross income and number three have an accounting software and actually use it so let's get back to number one um keeping your business finances separate um from your personal so this one is just if there's one thing you do just at least do this one this is huge it'll save you so much time so much of a headache and money when it comes to getting your taxes done and it's as simple as when you're ready to start freelancing go open your own business bank account checking business checking account and savings account and any business transactions you occur those all need to come out of that business account as well as if you need to get a credit card open a credit card just for your business expenses and then keep all of your personal expenses separate just like the way you've had them running through your own personal accounts this will be huge when it comes to tax time and you'll be able to separate the differences between your freelancing and business activities versus your personal activities number two save 25 to 30 percent of your gross income for taxes i know that sounds like a lot i know it sounds crazy but it's definitely something you need to do and i also think you really need to factor this in when you start to give quotes and create your pricing structures the government wants right off the bat 15.3 percent for selfemployment tax now that other 10 to 15 percent is just on the other income you receive so this is why you want to set up that savings account so as you get your business income coming into your business checking account i would say immediately or at least once a week take that income take that percentage of 25 to 30 percent and then dump that right into your savings account so you're into your business savings account so that is stored away tucked away for taxes and then when tax time comes there's no big surprises you've got the money you're good to go um so that is huge i think this one surprises a lot of people a lot of freelancers they don't realize how high selfemployment taxes and how much taxes will be taken out so do keep that in mind when you go to price when you create pricing structures and then number three have a accounting software and actually use it so i get a lot of clients that have accounting softwares they have things maybe synced up but they're not necessarily using it and i understand you get busy and if you can't use it or you don't know how then then reach out and get some help with it but when you go to select an accounting software i would get three major things one it can connect to your bank accounts and credit cards so these are typically gonna all be your cloudbased accounting um accounting software programs number two you can send your invoices from that platform or software whichever you choose and it has a pay now feature this will save you so much time and hassle as far as tracking your your invoices and then number two is you can pull a profitable loss report at minimum and profit law support ideally you'd like to be able to pull a balance sheet and a cash flow statement but you at least want to be able to pull a profit and loss report okay so let's move on to some accounting softwares um these are just a list of probably my top four the first two wave and freshbooks these are great for if you're just starting out they're very user friendly they've got a great interface on them um they're for the most part pretty intuitive i'm going to go over a little bit of things you need to to keep your eye on on the next video but these are great to just get started that you can invoice from them you can receive payments it'll track you can connect all your bank accounts and credit cards so these are great starters now if you you know let's say you want something you just want to stick with one and you want something that can grow with you those next two would be quickbooks online and xero these are great for more fullon businesses i mean you can still use them as a freelancer um these are more robust there's a lot more kind of going behind the scenes and i would say if you're just starting out they might have a little more too many more bells and whistles than you might need but that doesn't mean you can't use them you can still certainly use them you might want to get some training on those and even if you feel like you need to get training on the other two wave and fresh books i would definitely reach out and look for those but going back to quickbooks and xero these are great but again these will grow with you so you might not need these starting out you can certainly start in them but they're they will grow once you start having employees and you've got a lot more going on within your finances so this is just a brief overview um the next step or the next video we're going to get into is i'm going to kind of get into once you're in your accounting software what you really need to do and what you need to watch out for all right thanks let's move into your accounting software so you know how to get paid faster you know how to manage your receipts let's move into that accounting software and kind of get an idea of what we're looking at and what we're dealing with so just a warning this is a brief overview this is not going i'm not getting into any particular software so i do want to advise you that if you have questions reach out get help or get training from someone or take a course if you feel like you need to kind of get a better grip on this because if you start this out right it'll be much easier for you in the long run okay let's get started so what we're looking at right here is what's called a chart of accounts i'm going to just refer to these as income and expense buckets but these are chart of accounts a lot of these are going to be preloaded in your accounting software i will attach a pdf of this into this program but i want you to take a good look at the types so we've got income you can call this income or client sales or services that's going to be a revenue type any kind of expenses such as insurance or office supplies or rent those are all going to be expenses so as i said these will be already most of these a lot of some of them will be loaded in your accounting software you can change the names of them you can add more to them but as you start to do that use this as a guide as to what kind of type what one put a name on it whatever name you want and then you're going to use the type of account it's going to be and you can put it you can put a description in it's not a have to but this is very important because this type is going to tie to all your reports so depending on the type that will tie to your whether it falls on the p l the profit and loss report the balance sheet or the cash flow statement most of the time they're either going to just fall on the profit and loss or the balance sheet um so these are general expenses this is revenue um let's go to this next page okay so right here on owner's contribution or owner's pay this is labeled as equity this type is called equity and the reason for that is because this is not an income event so if you were to add money which would be owner's contribution add money into your business account that would be considered you're adding equity into your account if you were to take money out or to pay for any kind of personal expenses from your business account i don't recommend doing that on a daily basis or on a regular basis but if you made a slip up and you accidentally had an amazon account that got charged to your business account but it was a personal amazon purchase you could take that amount and code it to personal expenses or owner's pay um and those would not be that would not be considered an expense because you're it's the equity out of out of the money out of your business account these others right here some of these are kind of accounts that are working in the background so as you put in an invoice that accounting software is automatically going to code that invoice under the type accounts receivable because you're waiting for that money to come in you're waiting for it to be received to you accounts payable any kind of bills you owe if you go in and put a bill in but you haven't paid it yet and this isn't a necessary way of doing this you can certainly do it that way it definitely helps with your cash flow but if you're just paying your expenses as they come that's fine too but if you do decide to put your bills in and then pay later that would be an accounts payable and that will be labeled as accounts payable and that kind of automatically happens in the background of your accounting system um if you have any loans that's going to be a liability any taxes now taxes can be both a liability or an expense that's something you probably need to talk to your accountant to as far as how you're managing your filing and when you're filing your taxes that makes a big difference any large pieces of equipment are going to be considered assets and then retained earnings so retained earnings is any money that you made from the previous year so let's say at the end of your p l you had a positive of ten thousand dollars on december 31st of 2018 so come january 1st of 2019 that 10 000 is now going to move into retained earnings and now that p l will essentially start at zero so again use this as a guide um i will have a pdf of this and when you get into your your accounting software you're going to want to create these buckets or name them and like i said a lot of them will already be present um but use this as a guide to make sure you've got the right type so then your reports are correct as well okay um i have a weekly checklist a monthly checklist and a quarterly checklist so weekly you want to review your outstanding invoices and make any followup calls as needed you want to make sure you're organizing your receipts sort your bank transactions in your within your accounting software that's taking all those income and expenses and sorting them into those buckets we just talked about pay any bills and don't forget to pay yourself you can pay yourself monthly if you want to do it that way weekly if you have a good client flow it's not bad to pay yourself weekly because it kind of just helps you stay on track and helps you know your cash flow a little better monthly you want to reconcile your bank and credit cards this is so important i could create a whole other video on this i'm not going to but i suggest you really look into doing this is reconciling those banking credit card accounts against your bank statements and your credit card statements is like a big double check of what's going on within your accounting programs um review your profit and loss review your income i'm sorry review your expenses and subscriptions sub subscription creep is real i've seen it a lot so make sure you stay on top of those subscriptions and you know what you're using and ditch any of the ones you are not using and then after you review all that get a good idea of your cash flow once you kind of get a good grip of your expenses you'll really start to know what your cash flow situation will be like as well as staying on top of those invoices any overpaid invoices so quarterly you want to make sure you pay your quarterly taxes you want to review those pricing structures and then another one that i have not mentioned that's pretty important is make sure all your clients have a w9 from you so any client that you pay or i'm sorry that you invoice over six hundred dollars they should be requesting a double knight excuse me a w9 from you um if they do not be prepared they may be requesting it around mid to in january that's when we have to file those w9 so keep that in mind if on my next point if you ask for any help or you get any 1099 contractors to help you out you need to ask them for a w9 and it's just a onesheet irs document that basically just says you're an independent contractor um you can look it up google w9 and it's one of the first two or three things to pop up in google um you need that as well and you as if you hire any 1099 contractors you need to make sure you file those typically it's the last week of january i'm not going to be a specific date because the dates change every year around the last five days of january those need to be filed they're very easy to file it's 1099 filings is what they're called um so be prepared you're going to get asked that from your clients and if you happen to need to get any help with coding or design work for a client that you're working on you you need to make sure they hand you a w9 as well all right that should wrap up your checklist let's dive into the p l all right you've made it we're not at our last video um so i'm going to talk about the profit and loss on this one and hopefully this will kind of wrap up everything and help you understand why it's important to do good financials and really pay attention to those income and expense buckets okay so let's get started okay so as you'll see on the left there is a profit and loss example of a profit loss statement i have blocked out the names any dates anything that could possibly reveal whose profit and loss this is so let me just start off with saying why you want to run a profit and loss i think we all want to do what we love doing and i'm assuming you love being coders but i also think we all need to know how much money we're making and a profit and loss is going to tell you that it's going to take your income minus all your expenses and then tell you what is left over and the more you focus on this the more you're going to be able to realize what changes you need to make maybe what kind of pivots you need to make with pricing maybe where you can cut back on expenses where you could actually add more in expenses so a profit loss is very important in terms of giving you a snapshot of where you are and you can pull a profit and loss on a weekly basis on a monthly basis quarterly yearly it'll just tell you exactly how much money you've brought in and how much you've brought out this will help with cash flow i'm not going to tell you this is the best report i'm going to tell you that a cash flow statement is a best report for cash flow but for just getting started this will give you an idea at least on your expenses what you could expect each month or even each week so this is why it's important to have an accounting software that will provide a profit and loss statement for you i also suggest in terms of getting overall health of your business and trying to make business decisions just is pulling a balance sheet and a cash flow statement and if you don't understand those to have someone help you understand those and make uh decisions moving forward anyway that's my soapbox let's get started on the profit and loss so profit loss you're going to have top line is going to be on your income you might have different income types client services client design work client code work however you want to do that but that is going to go back to those revenue buckets so that's why back in the other video when i talked about the buckets that's what's forming this p l in the background okay so you're gonna see revenue slash income and expenses so that's why that's important to make sure those types back on the previous video are correct so all of that information lands on the right report okay so you've got your income cost of goods and i'll get to this in just a minute and then your general business expenses so cost of goods is going to be if you have any kind of product that you have to purchase and then you sell that product to your client that is going to be your cost of goods sold i don't think most of you will incur any of this if you're just doing servicebased business you're producing websites and codes and apps and things like that you really shouldn't have any cost of goods but that's just what that is here for um so you'll have top line income cost of goods and now you have a gross profit and then from that gross profit these are going to be your general expenses your rent your phone your internet your insurance anything that you incur on a regular basis or any kind of business doesn't have to be regular basis any kind of business expense and then that at the bottom that will give you your net operating income so this is going to tell you this 8 000 and 99.38 is going to tell you how much money you brought in in that given time period whatever given time period you selected okay so profit and loss statement should only have your business related expenses income and expenses um in terms of what it should not have i'm going to jump back to that interest expense in just a minute but i'll go ahead and i'm going to go ahead and jump to the loan payment first so if you have a loan a loan payment is a little interesting in the fact that you have to have you kind of have to split that payment and you put the principal amount to a liability account and the interest amount can be on an expense account and you can see that loan interest amount on the profit and loss but the principal amount is on the balance sheet i know that's a little confusing if you have any loans i would suggest getting help setting that up once you get it set up it's not that hard to manage but that's just something that i see a lot of mistakes made so bottom line is don't put the entire loan amount on the profit and loss statement it is not an expense it's kind of a mix of an expense and a liability i'll leave it at that for now i don't want to get too far in the weeds with that um profit laws should not have your owner's pay so again this goes back to that previous video about how the owners pay is equity anything equity related will be on a balance sheet so if you want to pull up your running owner's payout or running owner's contribution you will find that on your balance sheet as long as it's coded to equity mileage is not on a p l i get that question asked quite a bit you can't really put that on a profit and loss you can track it i would suggest using mile iq but you cannot really put it on them on a profit loss so if you have mileage if you are running from client to client track that mileage and turn that into your tax accountant and then bottom line is any expenses that you do not feel confident in justifying to the irs should not be on your profit and loss period so if you i get a lot of clients that try to want to put their kids soccer club in their business they want to expense that out because they want to call it networking or they want to put their botox so they want to put every amazon charge they've ever had to their profit and loss and label it as office expenses i'm never going to tell clients what to do but i will tell you this is you always want to feel confident and if you were to ever to face an audit which i ever hope you do not have to do but if you ever have to face an audit that you can comfortably and confidently say that it was a business expense here's my receipt and here's my invoice so just keep that in the back your mind if you ever in question on i don't know if it's a businessman's i don't know if it's personal i don't know how to code this just keep that in the back of your mind and then one other item that depending on how you have your books set up is any kind of what they call bad debt so if you have any lingering invoices let's say they're six months old or old or a year or even more that you have not gotten paid on you know you're not going to get payment on i would bring that up to your tax accountant when you go to do taxes that may affect your taxes a little bit for the better it may not it really depends on how you have your book set up so i didn't really want to list that on there because it could be different for everyone's situation in terms of how their accounting is set up that really gets into accrual basis versus cash basis i don't want to get too far into that because everybody's going to be different but just keep that in mind keep track of those and just if you do have any lingering invoices bring that up to your attacks account and just let them know and see if they have any suggestions all right well i really hope this helped you all um please reach out if you have questions get training if you're not sure on what you're doing i know it's a lot but if you just start off on the right foot and you start these good habits it'll make your life so much easier and you will save money in the long run and you'll be that much more ahead of the game because you're going to know where you stand financially what decisions you can make how you can start to price where you can cut back and how you can grow so stay in tuned of your finances and don't be afraid to reach out get help do a little bit of research i have more information on my website at kpibookkeeping.com i've got some blogs some videos um so best of luck to you and take care and thanks for watching bye okay a big thanks to aaron now let's talk about how to manage your dev work on a daytoday basis okay so it's time to start talking about how you're going to manage your substantive work on a daytoday basis and by substantive work i mean the actual dev work which is the whole reason you started free code camp and got into being a developer in the first place and managing your deb work appropriately daily will allow you to maximize your profits and proper management of your daytoday activities really focuses on two things first is the fact that you have to put in the time in other words you know you have to put the time into your business you have to go to work you would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs don't even put in a 40hour work week and the second thing is you have to make sure you're working efficiently and why do i say that both of these are important putting in the time and working efficiently think of it like this suppose you go to work and i go to work and you're 25 more efficient than i am and you work 30 hours a week and i work 40 hours a week well if you're 25 more efficient than me then in 30 hours a week you will accomplish what takes me 37 and a half hours but because i went to work for 40 hours in a week i'm going to accomplish more than you and because i'm going to accomplish more than you i'm going to make more money so with that being said if you and i both go to work for 40 hours and you're 25 percent more import or efficient than i am then in 40 hours you will accomplish what takes me 50 hours so this is why if you can work efficiently and put in the time you will make an astronomical amount of profits compared to what you would make otherwise now i think it's important to stress these things because you would be surprised at how many people don't put in 40 hours a week into their business so just as an example if you're going to work and you're not uh you know keeping track of your time which a lot of selfemployed people don't it can be easy to feel like oh man i worked a lot today when again at the end of the day you're really not putting in as much time as you thought you did right so making sure you're putting in the time and tracking the time is rule number one so let's start by looking at that and then let's look at what you need to do in terms of making sure you're working efficiently and we'll give some tips for improved efficiency okay so the first part of being successful on a daytoday basis is putting in the time when it comes to your business and putting in the time means that you've got a certain number of hours that you're going to work and that is just going to be a minimum that you're going to work every week there may be some weeks where you have to work more right because you may have a deadline you have to meet a project may be taking longer than expected and you have to work over to meet that deadline or something of that nature but the crucial part is to pick a number of hours you are going to work every week and make sure you put in those hours so in other words let's say you're you're going to work 40 hours a week at your business you get all your development work done in let's just say 30 hours then that means you've got 10 hours left that you need to be devoting to marketing your business you know that's you use that extra 10 hours to write blog posts make youtube videos uh go to networking events things of that nature so again set a number of hours that you're going to work every week and make sure you are putting in those hours and there is always something for you to be doing so there's are what there are ways for you to make sure you meet those hours me personally in my business i'm i put in a minimum of 43.3 hours every week and when i tell people that number sometimes i get weird looks because 43.3 is obviously not a round number where i came up with that is the fact that by working an extra 3.3 hours per week i wind up accomplishing in 12 months what would take someone working 40 hours a week 13 months in other words 3.3 hours more a week adds one more working month to my year and i find that combining that with trying to work efficiently really increases the amount i produce over a year over the course of a year i should say and as a result my income goes up so pick a number that you're going to put into your business and make sure you stick with it again if you don't have work to if you don't have development work to do put that extra time into marketing your business now it's really important that you do this in a way so that you avoid burnout let's say you decide you're going to work 45 hours in a week you know on average okay and then let's say you have a week where you work 47 well that means you can go ahead and take off two hours in another week and still be averaging 45 so in other words when i say i work 43.3 hours a week over the course of a year i make sure i average 43.3 some weeks i might work more some weeks i might work less if deadlines make me work more one week the next week i might take some time off or things of that sort so pick a number and stick with it and make sure that you put the time into something trust me there will always be something you can be doing in your business i cannot begin to tell you how many entrepreneurs i see who don't don't essentially know how much they work in a week like if you were to ask them how many hours do you require that you work in a week they don't have a number which i can understand someone saying they don't know how many hours they work in a week as a required number but then they also don't have for example set times of when they start work in the morning they don't have set times of when they go home they don't have set vacation schedules or requirements or anything like that so think of it like this those entrepreneurs don't get to work at any particular time just they just get to work whenever they feel like it they leave whenever they feel like it at the end of the week they're not making sure they've worked a certain number of hours and they just take vacation time whenever they want and people wonder why so many small businesses fail well one of the reasons why so many small businesses fail is just to be frank people who start up their own business don't put in the time so pick a number of hours stick with it and then make sure you're meeting those requirements and if you do that this may sound really simple but you will be ahead of a lot of your competition because your competition is just not going to put in the time it's just not going to happen put in the time for your business and you increase your chances of success just exponentially i can't stress that enough if you fail there's pretty good chances because you weren't putting in the time so again if you're going to make a fulltime if you've decided to make your new development business a fulltime job my suggestion is actually put your hour requirement a little bit over 40 hours because 40 hours is considered a normal work week right so challenge yourself a little bit do a little bit more again i get an extra month a year only by doing an extra 3.3 hours a week if you say 3.3 hours a week sounds like a lot ask yourself how much time do you spend looking at facebook how much time you spend you know watching television i mean how much time do you spend you know engaging in other you know like idle activities just cut out a few of those things and make sure you're putting the time into growing your business and then if when you combine those hours with high efficiency you'll produce so much that so many people are going to look at you and go how did that person produce all that they just won't understand it and they and you will understand it was a function of the time you put in plus the efficiency so pick a number of hours and stick with it and hold yourself to it show some discipline you know get your work ethic in and put put in that work ethic and you will succeed so with all that being said now let's take a dive into how you can actually make sure that those hours are going to be working are going to be spent doing something efficient okay in our last segment we talked about the need to put in the hours when it comes to your freelance business but now let's talk about how you can be productive when you're putting in those hours it's i'm going to talk about this because it's really important to remember that putting in time it does not necessarily equal getting stuff done um i've seen plenty of situations where someone might actually spend literally 14 15 16 hours a day at work and leave the day leave at the end of the day accomplishing virtually nothing i actually know of entrepreneurs who and i feel bad for them literally work 16 hours a day probably six to seven days a week and are just so inefficient in terms of how they go about their day that they accomplish probably what an efficient person would accomplish in a 30 hour work week so if you take putting in the time and combine it with efficiency that's how you become productive and that's how you make more money so the thing i can't stress to you enough again is you got to put in the time but don't think simply because you're putting in the time that you're being productive you have to put in the time but you also have to be efficient in your use of that time in other words you need to produce a lot per hour so think of it like this let's say you put in a lot of time let's say you put in 50 hours a week and now let's say you're twice as productive as somebody else that means in other words that you get twice done in an hour what someone else gets done in an hour which there are people that inefficient so there will be people that you're doubling their productivity if you put in 50 hours you're twice as productive as somebody else they have to go to work for 100 hours to you know accomplish uh you know what you did in 50 and if they're only working a 40 hour work week it takes them two and a half weeks to accomplish what you accomplish in one work week and that's how you make a lot more money you know as a freelancer as a selfemployed developer so again just simply going to work does not mean you're getting stuff done you have to be efficient in your use of time so let's look at a few pointers and again these are just a few this is by no means an exhaustive list let's look at a few examples in terms of how you can be more efficient with the use of your time number one is what i call the ohio method ohio stands for only handle at once i'll talk about what this means in a minute number two focus on completing one thing at a time don't always have nine different projects that you're trying to complete simultaneously number three when problems come up deal with them immediately and number four is going to be improved management of communications and by this i mean things like email text messages so on so forth if nothing else if you nail those four areas you will be working so much more efficiently than so many people out there that at the end of the work week people will just wonder how you got so much done and the answer to how you got so much done will be you didn't let time just waste away to and get lost to inefficiency all right so let's look at each of the things i just mentioned in term number one the ohio method ohio this stands for only handle at once and this concept applies to anything whether it's an email whether it's a piece of paper sitting on your desk um you know an issue that comes up or anything don't deal with issues more than once so think of it like this a piece of paper comes in you open it open up the letter it's something from the secretary of state saying you've got to file something to renew your business license well don't just set it over here because as soon as you do that now then when you decide to deal with it later you've got to pick it up and read it again which means you took the time to read it when you first opened it and then you took the time to read it uh when you deal with it the second time so you're reading the thing twice instead of once right so when as soon as you pick up a piece of paper deal with it and under that scenario envelope comes in i open it i read it it's from the secretary of state's office saying hey you've got to renew your business license i'm immediately going to put this down i'm going to go online i'm going to renew my business license it's done i only touched that piece of paper once in other words i only handled it once think of how many times in your life have you opened an email read the email and then said i'll deal with this later right well then when you go to deal with it later you have to read the email again which again you just read the email twice so imagine if you could cut your time spent reading email in half right so only handle it once applies to anything from a piece of administrative paperwork to emails to you name it anything that comes across your desk only handle it one time now this can be something that can be like very for lack of a better word difficult for people to implement because it's really easy for something to come in and you look at it and go i don't have time to deal with this and you said it over here then you don't have time to deal with the next thing you set it over here you don't have time to deal with the next thing then like you set it over here and then you go to work on something and you work all day and like you finish that okay but then later on when you look at these again i don't have time to deal with this so you move it back over here next thing you know you've just moved the same pile of papers back and forth five times and think of all that time you've wasted and you felt busy but all you were doing was moving those papers back and forth which is again a massive massive waste of time so you've got to be disciplined in the sense that you're not going to pick something up unless you're prepared to deal with it and then when you do deal with it or i should say when you do pick it up you do deal with it that's something again it can be easy to go i don't have time for this you don't have time not to do things that way your time is so precious you have to get things handled once and only once okay so follow the ohio method that's rule number one only handle it once rule number two is focus on one thing at a time and by this i'm talking about in your development work you need to have one project finish it move on to the next project finish it move on to the next project finish it so like with us for example like let's say we've got i'm making up a number let's say we've got four clients we're building websites for the you know i don't work on client number one a little bit one day work on client number two a little bit of that day same day work on client three a little bit because all you've ever got that way is a little bit of each thing done and the reason that's bad is it requires a lot of mental energy to switch from one project to the next to the next and so you're constantly like getting an efficiency drain by switching projects like that instead what we do let's say we have four websites we're working on we finish the first one we work on it we finish it done out the door then we work on the second one finish it out the door third one finish it out the door so on so forth and if somebody calls and wants a project we tell them okay you're number five in line and we adjust the delivery date accordingly when they ask when can we have it by we give them an honest delivery date because we say we've got four people ahead of you you know just to give an example so don't jump from project to project and as you get busy you're going to have two three four and more projects under contract that you know you're going to be working on get one done then move on to the next one get it done then move on to the next one get it done and so on and so on and so on and if you've got a bunch of projects already lined up to do and somebody calls you wanting more work be honest with them about a delivery date say i've got this many ahead of you and here here's what comes next all right so one thing at a time and it again saves you all that mental energy of switching from project to project to project which is just a huge you know efficiency drain at the end of the day number three when problems come up deal with them immediately and here's what i mean by this is uh it's really easy for you know some for something to come up and then for you to say okay i'll deal with this a little later well if it's a problem and you put it off until later the problem only gets bigger the problem compounds so now it becomes a bigger issue to deal with and that can become a bigger issue to deal with in terms of money it can become a bigger issue to deal with in terms of time it can become a bigger issue to deal with in terms of you know other things so let me let me give you an example easy example i like to use something comes in from the secretary of state saying you've got to send a piece of paper in to renew your business license and things fall through the cracks and it doesn't get done so now you're late sending in your business license you get a notice from the secretary of state saying um you know you are now going to have to pay an extra 100 for your business license that's a problem a problem has just arisen you now have to get your business license renewed and there's an extra amount um associated with it by dealing with things as soon as you get them then bam they're taken care of right uh you know if you get an unhappy customer get them on the phone right away get it dealt with you're like right away if you see things in your business that seem like they're causing an efficiency eliminate them on the spot don't say oh man we really got to clean up that process no eliminate them right there on the spot don't let them cost you more time as things go on when problems come up get them dealt with and get them dealt with on the spot i cannot stress that enough number four is your management of communications and this is a big one communications are one of the biggest things that can make you feel busy even though you're not actually producing anything all right so let's look at the two ways that you can manage your communications in a way that will greatly and i do mean greatly greatly greatly uh increase your productivity all right and the first thing you can do in managing your communications is avoid realtime communication platforms like slack uh google hangouts and and things of that nature where it's more of a chat than it is um you know like a formal message it's really easy like on a service like slack for example to constantly see messages coming through and then when someone gets a message others are prompted to respond and so on so forth and you wind up having a much higher message volume than you would through a medium such as email and the thing is number one every time you get one of those messages you become highly distracted and it gets hard to get back to what you were doing and you get into a workflow and number two the overwhelming majority of those messages you're getting through a realtime service such as slack aren't actionable anyway they're just noise okay so you're basically filling your day with noise which makes you feel busy but again you don't actually produce anything avoid realtime communications altogether i cannot stress that enough we do not use them in our businesses we don't use slack we don't use google hangouts we don't use any of those things and on the subject of communications manage your email properly so and what i mean by that is go through your email one to two times a day or however often you feel is appropriate but set aside set times that you're going to go through your email and avoid your email during all other times think of it like this you sit down you open your inbox you get a message from a client you respond to it client responds back you respond to it again client responds back you respond again client response back okay that's three or four emails from the client you had to read and that's three or four responses you've had to write now we all know a lot of people use email in a way where as soon as a thought enters their head they gotta fire off an email to somebody about it right if you say i'm only gonna go through my email once a day and that's it so like let's say for example you're gonna go through your email at three in the afternoon from three to four you're gonna clear your email when you get up and or get to work i should say in the morning you've got one one email in your inbox from joe client during the course of the day joe sends you three or four more emails well now at you know three or four in the afternoon when you're gonna go through your email you can read all four or five emails joe sent you at one time and then you can send them a consolidated response to all of them right so in other words you get to type one response as opposed to typing three or four or five individual responses that becomes a huge time saver and the other thing is you actually have less email to read by following that approach because if joe is going to email you three four or five times during the day anyway if you're responding to each of those then he's likely to respond to your responses so you go from getting four or five emails in a day from joe to getting 15 right so you greatly reduce the number of emails you have to read by going through your email once a day or twice a day and but again leaving your inbox closed at all other times or if it's not going to be closed at least not responding so set aside set times that you're going to respond to email and then go through it using the ohio method which we discussed a minute ago so if an email asks you for something don't just respond and say i'll get back to you on that respond with what the email actually asks for and only go through that inbox once a day and you will be surprised at how much less time you spend than your competitors going through email so let's put together everything we just talked about let's say your competitor does not follow the only handle at once method which was number one which means your competitors that work 40 hours a week and they probably spend 10 hours just moving the same stack of paper back and forth like we talked about right so number one they don't follow the ohio method so how much time are they losing there number two your competitors jumping between projects all the time which means they don't produce as much right so let's say they lose you know an hour a day moving the paper back and forth by not using the ohio method let's say they lose 30 minutes of productivity a day by jumping from project to project now they've lost an hour and a half of productivity you know a day let's say they don't deal problems immediately and as a result the problems become more time consuming later let's add 15 minutes or up to an hour and 45 minutes a day now let's suppose that due to inefficient communication practices which is what we just talked about with realtime communication services and email let's say they lose another two hours a day in an eight hour day we've just lost probably three to four hours three hours 45 minutes for you so call it three to four hours to essentially inefficiency so if you go to work for eight hours and that person goes to work for eight hours and they're losing let's say four hours of their their data inefficiency and you're not you're gonna produce twice as much as they are in an hour day which means you're going to make twice as much money as they do working the same amount of hours now combine that with the last section of our video where we talked about the need to put in a few extra hours and combine that extra productivity with those extra hours and actually know your income shoots through the roof right so again time but also productivity so focus on the tips we've just talked about in this and you are going to be fine so and you will actually see your income go up substantially well this is going to wrap up our course on how to succeed as a freelance developer i hope you found this helpful
