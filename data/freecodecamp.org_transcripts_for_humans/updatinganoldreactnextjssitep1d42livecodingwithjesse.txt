With timestamps:

00:06 - hey everybody its Jessie welcome to live
00:10 - coding with Jessie I'm sorry about the
00:13 - delay
00:14 - I thought that was a long delay
00:18 - yeah so like a half-hour ago maybe I
00:22 - decided to download some updates
00:25 - I wanted to restart my computer anyway
00:28 - because if you remember yesterday the
00:30 - camera wasn't working and usually if I
00:32 - restart it works well you know for weeks
00:34 - so unfortunately the updates took longer
00:40 - than I thought
00:42 - so that's why I started late I was
00:45 - trying to get a stream going on my
00:47 - laptop but I couldn't get it working
00:52 - fast enough before the updates finished
00:55 - so now it's everything's working now so
01:03 - again sorry about that lets it's saying
01:10 - that the resolution is not good on this
01:14 - stream so let me know how it's going
01:23 - all right so today we're gonna start
01:27 - sorry I just my computer just literally
01:30 - came back on you know two minutes ago
01:33 - oh trying to get everything everything
01:37 - ready okay
01:44 - so today we're gonna start for really
01:49 - from from the basics so I had some
01:52 - feedback saying that you know a lot of
01:54 - you like the beginner type of stuff so
01:56 - I'm not always gonna be doing beginner
01:59 - level work but what I'll try to do more
02:01 - of is even when I'm doing some of the
02:04 - advanced work I'll try to explain the
02:07 - steps you know a little bit better so
02:12 - that you know someone who is a beginner
02:13 - might be able to understand so today
02:17 - we're gonna go back to project one so I
02:20 - don't know how many of you were we're
02:22 - watching for project one but we're gonna
02:24 - go all the way back there and we will
02:30 - update some of our packages and because
02:36 - we need to make some changes to that so
02:39 - I've already gone back into the repo and
02:41 - I've opened some issues with some of
02:43 - those changes and we'll talk more about
02:46 - some of the changes I think I did a few
02:48 - weeks ago on a stream we may do some of
02:51 - the changes live on a stream we'll see
02:54 - how it goes but I thought this might be
02:57 - cool to do because I'm sure a lot of us
02:59 - have projects that we've done before and
03:03 - now you know six months later a lot of
03:07 - the packages that we use might be out of
03:09 - date well you know how do you go about
03:12 - updating things so that you don't break
03:14 - them so that's what I'm gonna try to do
03:17 - today and I have not done anything with
03:21 - this I haven't practiced at all so we'll
03:24 - see it may not work at all we may break
03:26 - it so we're just gonna kind of try to
03:30 - update things and test and see if things
03:33 - work we're going to be using
03:37 - you'll get so we can certainly revert
03:39 - back if we need to we could even do
03:42 - things on another branch and then merge
03:46 - when we're certain that everything works
03:48 - so let's let's give it a shot so as I
03:52 - said before since I'm trying to do this
03:54 - you know for beginners I'm gonna start
03:57 - you know right off the bat I haven't
04:01 - liked any commands yet let me try to
04:04 - find the right
04:08 - it's this alert okay so let me get
04:11 - switch you over to the screen there we
04:14 - go and oh I also did put that yesterday
04:21 - her should asked about that electron app
04:24 - that we had started up but I had
04:26 - forgotten to make the repo for that repo
04:29 - is now available so that's in that that
04:32 - marcom that fu s Markham organization
04:34 - that all the other projects are in now
04:37 - there's a project for that of electron
04:40 - one Oh Blake asks if I'm in another
04:44 - office no I just left the light on which
04:46 - I don't want the light on so hold on a
04:48 - second
04:56 - there we go
04:59 - when I was trying to do the stream from
05:02 - my MacBook the camera on there was just
05:05 - super dark so I had to turn the light on
05:09 - but I can't stand the glare off the
05:11 - screen when the lights are on all right
05:15 - so let me make this bigger so you all
05:16 - can see so I'm just starting here right
05:19 - from my terminal okay I happen to be
05:21 - using a program called I term - you can
05:23 - find the link for that in the
05:24 - description below this video but you
05:29 - know you don't have to use this you
05:31 - could use a different program you could
05:32 - use you know the built in terminal and
05:34 - like Visual Studio code or you know just
05:38 - the normal terminal that comes with
05:41 - whatever computer you're using so the
05:44 - first thing we're gonna do is we're
05:46 - gonna go into for me I keep all my stuff
05:50 - in a projects folder so I just CD the
05:55 - command a CD and then you type the name
05:57 - of the folder and now I'm gonna check
05:59 - this out and find our here we go see I
06:02 - react is the name of our projects we
06:04 - need to go into that folder so I'm gonna
06:07 - CD again and go see I react once you
06:12 - type in the first few letters you can
06:14 - hit the tab key and it will assuming
06:18 - that there's only one file but it could
06:21 - be based on what you've typed in already
06:23 - it'll just autocomplete the rest not a
06:26 - big deal for short names like that but
06:28 - when you get into some of these longer
06:30 - names like like this one it's very
06:33 - helpful because you know one little you
06:37 - know mistake and the computer has no
06:40 - idea what you're talking about so it it
06:42 - won't try to guess what you meant
06:45 - if you accidentally misspelled a word
06:47 - you know in the middle here alright so
06:51 - first thing that we always want to do
06:54 - when we go into a project that's being
06:56 - tracked you know it has a github
06:57 - repository or any type of git
06:59 - repositories we want to do a git pool
07:03 - this will pull any changes oops since I
07:07 - restarted my computer I have to put
07:08 - passphrase so I'm going to grab that
07:11 - quickly from LastPass and I will do that
07:15 - on my other screen so that you all don't
07:18 - see my my password
07:29 - yeah all right I'm gonna put that in
07:34 - there Oh No
07:40 - so not it this should work let me try to
07:44 - copy it again there we go and then I'm
07:51 - gonna do SSH ad and that way I won't
07:57 - have to put this passcode in again at
08:00 - least until I restart my computer okay
08:06 - so now we we should be able to do let's
08:13 - do it get pull make sure just make sure
08:16 - all right yeah I did run so we're
08:19 - already up to date so we don't have
08:20 - anything in our repository so we were
08:25 - safe to begin working so now I want to
08:29 - open this up I'm gonna open it up in
08:31 - Visual Studio code I've been using that
08:35 - a lot lately we did most of this project
08:37 - using atom but it's fine to switch
08:40 - between our code editors so the shortcut
08:43 - for Visual Studio code if you have it
08:46 - installed and you've installed the
08:47 - command-line interface you just do code
08:54 - and then dot you put the dot there it
08:58 - opens up the whole folder there we are
09:03 - and now I'm gonna make this take up the
09:07 - full screen
09:12 - and let's let's open up our terminal
09:22 - here so our integrated terminal so now
09:28 - we won't have to switch back and forth
09:29 - we can type in our commands right here
09:31 - and first things first let's check out
09:35 - our package JSON this is what we're
09:37 - going to be concerned with for for most
09:39 - of the time so I'm going to get rid of
09:40 - this sidebar and I'll make that a bit
09:46 - bigger I hope that's big enough for
09:48 - everyone to see and I'm gonna move this
09:51 - down just a bit and I could always make
09:55 - it bigger when we need it so let's just
09:57 - let's check some things out here so
09:59 - we're running next to point 4.3 and we
10:02 - can see the latest version is four point
10:05 - two point one so we're way behind
10:11 - same way with react latest version of
10:14 - react is sixteen point two so we have
10:20 - some work to do here
10:24 - let's see what else so I'm just going
10:28 - through this just to refresh my memory
10:31 - on what we're doing for this project so
10:33 - we have Auto formatting going of our
10:36 - code linting set up so it's good
10:46 - it looks like most of what we're using
10:52 - can be updated alright so I just checked
11:02 - the live chat here harsh it says that
11:04 - there are no braking changes so if we
11:06 - run yarn upgrade latest it should work
11:09 - so let's do that first of all let's
11:12 - confirm that it is running locally right
11:15 - I would hate to have it that something
11:20 - right now that's going on be breaking it
11:22 - and somehow think that what we're about
11:24 - to do will break it so let's do let me
11:28 - see what we had to come in for dev ok so
11:31 - I'm gonna run it in this other terminal
11:34 - so we'll go yarn dev and hit enter and
11:40 - we'll see it's going to start we'll be
11:43 - able to check this site out in just a
11:47 - minute there we go we're on localhost
11:51 - 3000 I'm also gonna start up this end
11:55 - rot server we got here believe I need to
12:00 - do this and grog there we go I'm going
12:12 - to paste a link and you should be able
12:17 - here in the live chat you should be able
12:19 - to see the site as we work on it with
12:22 - that link and I forgot to start my timer
12:26 - so I'm gonna do 25 minutes of like
12:29 - coding updating testing and then after
12:32 - that I'm gonna take a five-minute break
12:33 - I'm gonna go back to the live chat
12:34 - answer any questions that you have so if
12:37 - you've asked a question already just
12:39 - hold on till we're done with this twenty
12:42 - five minute period I'll answer your
12:43 - questions if you can't stick around for
12:45 - the answer you could always watch the
12:47 - recording of this video you know
12:49 - sometime later on you know whenever
12:52 - whenever you have time to watch it so it
12:57 - looks like yeah we have people connect
13:00 - that's working and I will pull over a
13:05 - browser window as well onto this screen
13:09 - and I will check it out the localhost
13:12 - 3000 - great it looks like it's working
13:17 - use the home page is working let's click
13:20 - on some things okay awesome
13:24 - so since that's working now let's update
13:27 - so let me check out again what Harshit
13:30 - has suggested to run yarn upgrade latest
13:34 - and was that - - yes it's so down here
13:39 - I'll bring it up a bit so down here in
13:41 - our terminal
13:42 - we're gonna run yarn update upgrade and
13:50 - then we'll do latest I apologize for the
13:58 - yawn I haven't had very much caffeine
14:01 - today I had like a cup of tea and it was
14:09 - a really old tea bag it's been sitting
14:11 - in my desk drawer for like two years so
14:16 - wasn't the greatest cup of tea
14:20 - alright so just to show you how much
14:25 - that does this is this is what it's all
14:28 - you know kind of installed and went
14:32 - through all these packages so we have
14:34 - our base packages that we can see in our
14:36 - package JSON but they all have
14:37 - dependencies of other packages so I mean
14:41 - look at that quite a bit
14:43 - still scrolling yeah so we started way
14:46 - up here and we have all this scroll so
14:52 - saved 829 new dependencies it's just
14:59 - amazing yeah long scroll okay
15:08 - we did get some warnings usually these
15:10 - aren't really a big deal but you know if
15:14 - you what if you're worried about them
15:16 - you could always read them and then you
15:20 - know correct that so in this case these
15:23 - ones all are just saying that we have
15:27 - something in dependencies we have
15:33 - something in dev dependencies already
15:35 - and we were also trying to add it in our
15:38 - regular dependencies so not shouldn't
15:41 - really big be a problem for us and if it
15:45 - is we can switch it up later on
15:47 - all right so we'll do a git status just
15:50 - to make sure what's changed and this is
15:52 - perfect this is what we expected to be
15:54 - changed this package.json and our yard
15:57 - and lock so let's test it out now before
16:04 - we commit anything so I'm gonna go here
16:08 - I think it'd probably be a good idea to
16:11 - restart this server since we made so
16:13 - many changes so we're just gonna exit
16:18 - out so I hit ctrl C to stop that server
16:23 - and then I just went with another yarn
16:25 - dev and let's see we got a look we did
16:31 - gets we have a warning here okay so we
16:41 - have some weird stuff going on well it
16:45 - looks like it's still loaded so let's
16:47 - see what what we've got here
16:48 - for these warnings so each out in an
16:51 - array or iterator suge unique key
16:53 - problem okay so evidently somewhere
16:55 - we've forgotten to put a key fob and
17:04 - Reformation okay so it has given us some
17:08 - file names and line numbers where you
17:10 - can check some of these things out so
17:17 - maybe we can go through some of these
17:19 - and fix them
17:32 - you know what I have this air is it's
17:36 - saying there's no entry and another
17:38 - window I had I had a different project
17:40 - open and I was also running that on
17:43 - local I was 3,000 and it's still open so
17:45 - I'm going to close that right now so we
17:47 - get rid of all that mess all right
17:53 - okay so let's check this out see what we
18:00 - have going on let me let me do a hard
18:02 - refresh so this video shows up - hmm it
18:09 - should have shown up
18:20 - I'm also gonna bring up dev tools to see
18:22 - if we're getting any errors in the
18:24 - console okay we have that key proc
18:30 - warning again the same the prop type
18:34 - warning okay
18:43 - all right so we do have a few things
18:44 - that we need to work through so that's
18:46 - good if we had nothing to that went
18:49 - wrong then it would have been a really
18:52 - short stream okay I am gonna
18:56 - double-check the live chat quickly just
18:59 - to see if I've done anything wrong so
19:02 - far or if you won't notice something in
19:04 - any of the output that I didn't catch
19:20 - oh here's a nice comment this is
19:22 - interesting so John Hanson says I run
19:25 - the NPM outdated it almost every time I
19:28 - do an editing session fingers crossed
19:30 - every time so I you know what I'm gonna
19:34 - have to keep that in mind because it's
19:36 - much easier to do very small incremental
19:38 - updates than to do like I've done here
19:40 - and wait months before we update
19:42 - something so I think that that's a good
19:45 - a good practice I'm gonna have to really
19:48 - try to train myself to make a habit of
19:52 - frequently updating especially when
19:55 - we're in the process of building
19:58 - something because at that time it's I
20:00 - mean that's really the time to change
20:02 - things and work out any bugs so I
20:06 - actually really liked that idea and we
20:14 - did have a question about whether or not
20:15 - this was an actual website it is an
20:17 - actual website you can find a link to it
20:19 - in the description
20:20 - it's kadek etics comm is the live
20:23 - version so we're working on this locally
20:27 - and then you all have the link to be
20:29 - able to see this as well using Angra
20:42 - right
20:58 - okay so it looks like the only thing I'm
21:02 - seeing in relation to what we've just
21:03 - done is Hardison saying that he's not
21:06 - getting an error in dev tools when he's
21:10 - running this through through end rot so
21:13 - that's that's interesting let me let me
21:20 - try to empty the cache as well it should
21:22 - already be anything since I have dev
21:24 - tools open but we'll see I am a little
21:27 - bit worried about why this video is not
21:29 - loading anymore let's let's go through
21:39 - some of these errors and fix these first
21:41 - and if that video is still not loading
21:43 - then we'll dig into it I don't know why
21:46 - this would be messing up the video but
21:48 - you never know it might fix it so we'll
21:53 - just try it
21:54 - Sanjay asks what is and rock and rock is
21:57 - this little command-line tool that I
21:59 - have here it's let me make it bigger as
22:02 - you can see it so I get the name of the
22:08 - person who made this is just slipping my
22:10 - mind but his Twitter handle is izzat
22:12 - inconceivable
22:15 - he very generously has kind of donated
22:20 - unlimited use of this to free code camp
22:24 - for these streams but there's a free
22:26 - version that has more limited use and
22:30 - basically what you can do is run
22:32 - something locally on your machine and
22:34 - then turn on this little command-line
22:37 - tool and it will give you a URL that you
22:42 - can share with other people and they can
22:45 - check out what you're doing locally in
22:47 - real time from anywhere as long as they
22:50 - have an internet connection so for these
22:53 - streams it's very very helpful
22:56 - hey harsh it's getting the errors now so
22:59 - normally not happy to see errors but in
23:02 - this case I'm glad that someone else is
23:04 - seeing the errors as well alright and
23:07 - har should also is seeing the video
23:12 - that's interesting all right I'm not
23:13 - gonna worry about the video now we'll
23:15 - get to it at some point okay so let's
23:21 - let's take these errors one by one so
23:27 - oops I got a better description over
23:30 - here oh no I didn't I didn't see this
23:34 - we're actually getting the good
23:35 - description here so that index dot
23:39 - Chasse and she's 73 let's see if that's
23:44 - if that's legit number so let's go in
23:50 - here to that static yep just you know
24:03 - what
24:07 - it's just where our index chance is oh
24:10 - it's in our pages folder that's where it
24:13 - is it's trying to switch back and forth
24:17 - between different like reacts routing
24:20 - systems you kind of like forget where
24:22 - things are that's what happened in this
24:24 - case I forgot that we have everything in
24:26 - pages when we're using next okay
24:31 - let's double-check that number where do
24:34 - we get 73 so let's check out 73
24:47 - hmm
24:54 - all right so if we add in a keeper up
24:56 - here that should fix it so let's go with
24:58 - key and let's give it the key prop let's
25:11 - go
25:17 - I wonder what I'm bringing in one if
25:20 - we're going to the post ID
25:22 - let's try post ID if I am pulling that
25:26 - data this will work and it'll give it a
25:28 - unique key so let's try it out
25:41 - yeah it worked okay so I am bringing in
25:45 - well I see some some of you in the live
25:48 - chat we're saying I could just use the
25:49 - index you you can you can definitely use
25:52 - the index I to use the post ID as the
25:56 - key because it's assuming that you're
26:00 - getting the data from one WordPress
26:02 - installation you're never going to have
26:03 - the same key so that we'll make sure we
26:06 - get a unique identifier there and in
26:11 - cases where I don't have an ID I've used
26:14 - like a random number before so I think
26:17 - it's like UUID is the package and that
26:20 - will also give you a kind of a nice
26:24 - random number and this is just to make
26:26 - sure that we don't accidentally have the
26:28 - same values for key so basically
26:32 - everything you want to have a different
26:35 - key value all right let's check this one
26:39 - out seventy nav so we're gonna look in
26:44 - the nav component on line 73 so let's
26:49 - check that out
26:50 - where's our nav components components
26:55 - there we go and nav alright 73 one nice
27:05 - thing about next and I'm sure other
27:07 - frameworks have things like this but one
27:10 - nice thing about next is the error
27:12 - messages are pretty descriptive and
27:14 - helpful so it's usually not too bad
27:17 - trying to debug things all right so we
27:21 - have this link here and we have a hmm
27:26 - okay so evidently on link title is not
27:33 - valid to use
27:38 - maybe this is something that's changed
27:40 - in the newer version of next so this
27:46 - this link is something that comes with
27:48 - next and it has to do with the
27:51 - prefetching so maybe title is not
27:58 - available anymore I could just get rid
28:02 - of the title and that would be okay but
28:04 - instead I'd actually like to see if
28:06 - there's an alternative here so let's
28:08 - check out the documentation for next
28:10 - it's been quite a while since I've
28:15 - looked up this link tag stuff so there
28:22 - we go let's see so here it is in prefix
28:28 - you drop out the link
28:33 - hmm so here's our link but
28:45 - if we need we need more info so let's
28:48 - see if there's more in depth ducks
28:50 - that's that are linked to let's check
28:54 - out learn next yes calm I haven't been
28:57 - here for a while either I don't want
29:02 - that I really don't want to do the
29:03 - tutorial I just want to see the content
29:20 - okay hard saying move the title to a tag
29:23 - be a tag all right let's check that out
29:38 - okay cool that makes sense and let's see
29:45 - while we're on this screen this is
29:47 - actually very helpful so learn next J s
29:51 - comm will give you kind of a nice you
29:54 - know guide to get you started if you've
29:57 - never used next before John Hanson asked
30:01 - if next was like react router next has
30:04 - routing built into it so it has some
30:06 - elements that do behave like react
30:08 - router all right so I'm going to close
30:15 - that out and I'll close this out there's
30:18 - also a ton of great information just
30:20 - right here in the git repo for next ok
30:26 - so let me refresh ok it looks like we're
30:36 - using that same that title in another
30:39 - place so let's fix that now since we've
30:42 - just done that we're sticking I have
30:44 - line 15 so let's check out sticky nav
30:48 - line 15 oh okay and it looks like we are
30:55 - using this quite a bit so I'm guessing
30:58 - that this used to be valid at one time
31:00 - with next and then now it's not because
31:03 - obviously we would have seen all these
31:04 - errors before or at least you know the
31:09 - warnings
31:19 - so I'm just going to move all these down
31:21 - here into these a tags so if you're not
31:30 - familiar at all with what next does one
31:32 - of the cool things that it can do is
31:34 - prefetch pages so it can grab the HTML
31:36 - four pages before the user is even
31:39 - navigated to those pages and so that's
31:42 - why we've wrapped our a tags in our link
31:47 - tags so you don't have to prefetch with
31:50 - the link tag if you just put the link
31:52 - tag without this prefetch attribute then
31:55 - it'll still do client-side routing for
31:58 - you right so that means it's just going
32:00 - to work out what's going to be on the
32:03 - next page right there in the client
32:04 - there's no page refresh that happens
32:06 - right it doesn't have to hit the server
32:08 - again but the prefetch is nice and it
32:12 - results in much faster load times so
32:18 - once the user gets that initial load
32:20 - over with you know every click that they
32:23 - go to where they're you know we had that
32:25 - link prefetch tag is going to be nearly
32:27 - instantaneous and we were first testing
32:30 - this site after we launched it the
32:33 - analytics the Google Analytics were
32:36 - showing a load time of 0 seconds for all
32:40 - the interior pages so that was I was
32:46 - pretty excited about that I've never
32:48 - seen zero cents for load son
32:52 - okay okay harsh it did say that that
32:57 - change came in next three because
33:00 - they're not passing the tags to the a
33:04 - tag so they're not passing the props to
33:05 - the a tag so evidently before anything
33:09 - else that you would put on this link tag
33:11 - that wasn't immediately used by the link
33:14 - tag like this prefetch or the href we
33:16 - just automatically get passed down to
33:19 - the a tag inside so I guess that's not
33:21 - happening anymore so that's why it's
33:23 - registering as an invalid tag so good to
33:27 - know thanks hard
33:31 - oh let's see what do we have here
33:35 - okay so wow we're using this title I I
33:40 - think we're gonna be chasing around
33:43 - these these title attributes quite a
33:46 - while so let's kind of this text reveal
33:50 - image card and where was this at 73 wait
33:56 - a second
33:57 - 21 okay all right so let's grab that and
34:07 - put it down here
34:11 - and save
34:19 - okay great
34:34 - okay hey I think we got rid of all those
34:37 - linked attribute errors whoops click the
34:41 - wrong thing there console all right
34:47 - great now we can move on to another air
34:49 - so we have a warning
34:50 - I shouldn't say errors most of these are
34:52 - just warnings if not all of them so I
34:54 - mean obviously the site still working
34:57 - did not expect server HTML to contain a
35:01 - div in div okay
35:19 - let's see if it's telling us what it's
35:22 - telling us here
35:42 - actually I'm gonna stop this and restart
35:45 - it I just want to see the message again
35:46 - that it gives me in the console to see
35:48 - if there's any difference in what we're
35:51 - seeing in our dev tools console versus
35:55 - our terminal okay there's slight slight
35:59 - difference
36:16 - okay so check out team Jas
36:30 - and where was it saying
36:43 - hmm
37:05 - I'm not really sure what the air is here
37:10 - so I'm looking at this one now check the
37:14 - top level render call usually do we're
37:20 - looking at team jazz all right so my
37:23 - timer just went off here so we'll think
37:27 - about this one for a few minutes while
37:30 - we do to some questions so let me take a
37:33 - short 5-minute break and I'm gonna
37:36 - scroll all the way up to the top of the
37:37 - live chat and I go through and try to
37:39 - get through as many questions as I can
38:00 - okay a hardship mentioned early in the
38:03 - stream that this was the react jQuery
38:05 - mix project yeah yeah I I should
38:08 - probably mention that in case some of
38:10 - you are checking out the repo now or the
38:12 - code this was an odd setup where we
38:16 - blended jQuery with react so I'd
38:19 - actually love to switch it over so we're
38:22 - not using any jQuery at some point I
38:24 - think I made an issue for that but
38:26 - that's going to be a really big project
38:29 - it's not entirely necessary right now
38:30 - cuz everything's working but if we ever
38:33 - get some time that might be a nice
38:34 - project to do
38:45 - let's see
39:01 - blake is asking if anyone has written
39:04 - batch scripts i don't really have that
39:08 - much experience with with writing bash
39:11 - script so i can't help you out too much
39:17 - with that
39:30 - okay Josh Modi'in was asking about a
39:34 - project that he's creating but then he
39:37 - had to go so sorry about that
39:40 - if you can if you watch this later on
39:43 - and you know maybe you still have some
39:45 - questions join us for another live
39:47 - stream or comment on this video you know
39:50 - send me a message on Twitter or
39:51 - something I'd be I'd be happy to talk to
39:54 - you about your project
40:04 - Phillips's could anyone recommend some
40:06 - package or way to play notification
40:09 - sounds in react app hmm I I don't know
40:20 - that I've ever heard of a package I've
40:22 - never really needed that so I've never
40:23 - looked at it looked for it so I don't
40:27 - know of any package is anybody else know
40:36 - of anything like that could help out
40:38 - Phillip a package that I would play
40:44 - notification sounds and a react app
41:01 - okay Philip asked does anyone know how
41:04 - to do search engine optimization with
41:07 - react without server-side rendering for
41:11 - example Facebook sharing is still
41:13 - showing react app as a title not sure
41:16 - what to do mm sorry for the on again I
41:23 - need some coffee or something
41:26 - uh-huh okay so to do it without
41:32 - server-side rendering yet I - honestly I
41:37 - think the best way is with the
41:39 - server-side rendering if you can't do
41:41 - that kind of the older way to do things
41:44 - would to be used something like phantom
41:48 - Jes I think it's called
41:49 - which basically like will serve two
41:53 - crawlers like search engine crawlers or
41:57 - things like that a version of your site
41:59 - that is already been pre-rendered and
42:02 - just kind of like stored so at least
42:06 - that's my understanding of what those
42:07 - things do it I've never really used them
42:10 - but I have looked into using them before
42:13 - and I decided that the server-side
42:15 - rendering would be the better way to go
42:19 - all right my time is almost up let's see
42:22 - if I can get one more call it
42:24 - questioning looks asking about is it
42:28 - valid to put eight reps on the a tags
42:31 - inside the link tags saying JSX the its
42:39 - a11y but I really want to pronounce that
42:42 - as a lie can I do that is that a thing
42:45 - anyway it has to do with accessibility
42:48 - for like screen readers and things so
42:51 - anyway what I'm gonna start calling Ally
42:54 - wants href on the a tags I I don't
43:00 - really know
43:04 - I'd say just try it out and see if it
43:08 - works because it may be that it would
43:14 - work all right like that but I'm
43:17 - guessing that there are other people
43:19 - that have thought about that and run
43:21 - into that issue as well so if you try
43:25 - and it doesn't work
43:26 - I'm guessing this probably an issue for
43:29 - that you know or somebody's brought it
43:31 - up at some point
43:34 - okay Hart should also mentioned using
43:37 - puppeteer to serve up versions of your
43:41 - site to to crawlers so that they see you
43:47 - know what they should be saying yeah so
43:52 - I've never used puppets here so I can't
43:55 - personally say anything about it but you
43:58 - might want to check that out as well
44:08 - oh okay so evil has some advice for us
44:13 - on that that last air that we got so
44:18 - let's go back to the code now and let's
44:27 - check that out
44:28 - so one more Pomodoro session probably
44:32 - just do one more and then probably wrap
44:36 - things up around there we'll see we'll
44:39 - see in any case at the end of the stream
44:41 - we'll definitely you know get to all the
44:43 - questions that you have in the live chat
44:49 - all right so let's go back to okay so
44:57 - Evo saying you know don't you need
44:59 - parentheses in that map okay yeah let's
45:05 - let's add some parentheses here and see
45:09 - see what that does
45:20 - you know the one here right
45:29 - yeah should need to because we got one
45:31 - too right yeah okay it was giving me a
45:35 - red squiggly line at first I didn't
45:38 - understand why all right let's try this
45:40 - out now
45:41 - so we've saved it let's do a refresh
45:47 - here see what we get
45:53 - [Music]
45:58 - actually this this wasn't giving us what
46:01 - we want to eat we got that air here so
46:03 - let me restart the server and see what
46:07 - air we get see if we get the same thing
46:10 - I'm gonna check the live chat see if
46:13 - there's any other discussion about this
46:36 - all right that's okay we're still
46:40 - getting that still at the same line all
46:42 - right interesting
46:43 - Harshit I see also said try navigating
46:46 - right to the team page because there's
46:48 - still more errors there so let's check
46:53 - that out so we need a key prop there as
46:57 - well
46:58 - Wow was I thinking with these key props
47:04 - this is like something that I rarely
47:07 - forget now but you know was less
47:11 - experienced when we are doing this site
47:13 - like six months ago it's just kind of
47:15 - amazing to look back and think how did I
47:16 - forget key props on everything all right
47:21 - so let's check it out
47:31 - let's put a key in here and this can be
47:37 - just like we did before let's do a post
47:39 - ID okay Evo said it probably it does not
47:51 - need parenthesis all right
47:53 - well let's take him up then not a big
47:57 - deal
47:59 - alright but we didn't need to put a key
48:03 - in there so that's good let's check back
48:13 - whoa
48:21 - okay so did not match server the client
48:25 - didn't match the server that's
48:28 - interesting let me let me show this
48:31 - refresh again well that's odd I wonder
48:50 - mmm
49:07 - that's odd
49:16 - hearted saying check out get initial
49:19 - props
49:50 - okay I notice how I should comment
49:52 - Harsha's comment about puppeteer is
49:54 - saying that I actually have used puppets
49:56 - here because we were using it for NN
50:00 - testing you know that now that you say
50:02 - that I do I remember puppeteer was in
50:04 - there so I'm using it kind of indirectly
50:08 - I don't handle it it just runs when we
50:11 - do our test so alright so let's see I
50:18 - mean we should be getting
50:29 - I'm wondering if this may be just
50:33 - something weird is going on locally whoa
50:45 - interesting yeah when I go to it like
50:48 - this obviously we don't get it but when
50:52 - we refresh and see if we get it again
50:54 - yep we do okay so on refresh we get that
50:58 - I said you're saying and also remember
51:04 - for this project we have a test server
51:06 - on digital ocean so we can run this in
51:09 - production mode and see if we're still
51:12 - getting this kind of thing happening so
51:15 - we're gonna have another whole nother
51:20 - level of tests going on all right
51:25 - okay well that seems to be the only
51:27 - thing that we have happening now on the
51:31 - team page
51:41 - okay coach
51:44 - that's ko Jae I'm just gonna say coach
51:47 - for now correct me if that's the wrong
51:49 - pronunciation
51:51 - it says the div and a bear seems to be
51:53 - because you're somehow initially
51:54 - rendering a different tree on the client
51:56 - versus a server yeah I just I don't I'm
52:01 - not seeing right now how or why it's
52:04 - rendering differently let's take a look
52:11 - again at this page and see what we're
52:12 - doing in the team closer
52:33 - interesting
52:54 - this
53:00 - okay okay
53:10 - all right so they're at this page works
53:14 - perfectly fine when you navigate to it
53:17 - through the client-side routing but when
53:21 - you navigate through you know when it's
53:23 - the first load through the server-side
53:25 - routing it doesn't work there's just a
53:28 - bunch of data that's missing so harsh is
53:33 - saying restart the server maybe it's the
53:35 - cache ok yeah let's try that all right
53:41 - so let's restart the server see what we
53:44 - get
54:11 - mmm okay still getting this error
54:16 - okay still that let's try to refresh
54:23 - yeah still still getting that error
54:47 - okay John sang how I should sing show up
54:52 - in the terminal John sang maybe there's
54:56 - some inline styles that are causing that
54:58 - error all right so it looks like this is
55:06 - all we're getting on that latest restart
55:14 - okay so we are getting we do checkout
55:17 - hedge as you know what let me check this
55:20 - out really quickly because this seems
55:21 - like something that's a really easy fix
55:23 - so let's just do it while we see it
55:25 - there and then we'll go back to this
55:28 - team page
55:36 - there's five
55:44 - there we go
55:51 - all right so let's check out initially I
55:58 - thought we were having some issue with
56:01 - our jQuery but if that was the case we
56:03 - wouldn't be able to open these modal's
56:04 - so I don't think that's the problem the
56:08 - problem this is odd let's see we're
56:14 - getting here yes
56:16 - no we're like we're getting some data
56:21 - but not other data right so we get all
56:24 - this but not this and we should be able
56:30 - to get that let's see what we're doing
56:32 - where are we getting that data
56:41 - because concert rendered
56:57 - and this is our
57:04 - all right you know that's the top
57:06 - section so we're not worried about that
57:07 - but that is coming in properly right yes
57:10 - it is okay so let's go down here to our
57:13 - cards I just can't remember exactly how
57:16 - I did this before it's too long ago I'm
57:20 - trying to see where where exactly that
57:25 - data is getting put in for the modal
57:27 - there you go contents for a team card
57:32 - here and then the bottom modal's
57:43 - I'm gonna see where we have our modal's
57:55 - all right let's check out the team card
57:57 - component then
58:10 - this rose content
58:14 - all right let's check out our static
58:18 - JavaScript file I think I remember what
58:24 - was happening
58:52 - oh man I was using fair - this is a
58:57 - little bit painful to watch - look at
58:59 - this code
59:13 - hmm
59:21 - all right while we're in here I'm gonna
59:23 - remove these console logs because we
59:25 - don't need those
59:26 - get out of here console logs all right
59:34 - let me check the live chat harsh is
59:40 - saying isomorphic fetch seems like an
59:42 - error with the fetch okay let's see what
59:45 - I'm using here yeah I am bringing in
59:49 - isomorphic fetch
60:07 - all right let me check got a question
60:09 - here about this code again so we're I'm
60:13 - saying there this card equals this
60:16 - saying does that make sense it might not
60:19 - make sense it's been a while since I
60:22 - wrote this Levite when are you using
60:24 - this card this I don't know it's
60:34 - possible that it was necessary to make
60:37 - this variable at some point and then I
60:39 - changed the code and it wasn't and I
60:41 - never switched it back it's possible I
60:43 - just didn't know what I was doing and I
60:45 - did that unnecessarily so I'm not gonna
60:48 - try to refactor this right now because
60:52 - we're gonna completely get rid of all
60:54 - this jQuery at some point so I'm not
60:59 - gonna worry about anything in here right
61:00 - now
61:02 - only if it's like I absolutely have to
61:04 - fix something because it doesn't work
61:06 - anymore
61:14 - all right let's see coach is saying what
61:23 - is good
61:29 - st. component did mount is not available
61:32 - and rendering on the server you're
61:35 - setting up some data there which appears
61:37 - to be in conflict the conflict between
61:39 - the client the server okay page the team
61:47 - colored sections you know there
61:49 - shouldn't there's nothing going on with
61:51 - data in here this just and it's these
61:58 - and you can see here this is just
62:01 - initializing like the modal's in
62:06 - material materialized CSS so there
62:13 - shouldn't be any change of the data all
62:17 - it should all it should be doing is just
62:19 - allowing us the modal to open and then
62:21 - allowing us to open and close these
62:23 - sections
62:36 - okay let me check my time
62:39 - whoo seven minutes all right
62:52 - let's look at this again
63:12 - yeah it does seem it does seem like
63:16 - we're not getting that call made on the
63:19 - server side like like you all were
63:21 - saying because here when we see the
63:23 - server does nothing no data but then for
63:25 - the client we have all this I mean this
63:28 - is all the stuff this is only this stuff
63:32 - that's supposed to go see yeah yeah this
63:44 - is only the data that's supposed to go
63:46 - inside the modal let's look back at
63:49 - where we're putting that component in
63:52 - the in the modal or where we're putting
63:55 - that data into the modal I don't think
63:58 - we have a separate modal component right
64:02 - all right so let's see where this is it
64:08 - should be grabbing this data team member
64:15 - yeah we're grabbing all the data from
64:18 - the team members this is this is where
64:23 - we have our API calls to the WordPress
64:25 - API
64:32 - all right so that's the top section we
64:34 - don't need to worry about that
64:43 - that would do this I definitely do this
64:47 - differently if I were making it now but
64:51 - it works
65:05 - okay so we are putting the content we're
65:10 - passing that to team card all right let
65:18 - me check team card again I don't think
65:20 - we need that anymore we don't need that
65:24 - fixed all that let me fix that okay all
65:33 - right so let's see what we're doing with
65:34 - content
65:46 - okay so we have a div with a class of
65:48 - content we've setting it to display:none
66:11 - I think we can take this out let's try
66:15 - taking this out
66:33 - let me try to restate
66:49 - same thing
66:57 - actually let me check now
67:04 - remember this was working if we went to
67:07 - it with the client-side so let me make
67:09 - sure I didn't mess it that up as well
67:15 - now it's still there see so that section
67:18 - that we had before was completely
67:19 - unnecessary so that was probably left
67:23 - over from initially before we turned
67:26 - this into react the way we're doing the
67:28 - modal's was unclick it grabbed the data
67:30 - from that particular div and then
67:34 - because you're clicking on this
67:36 - container dev so we're gonna grab the
67:38 - data within it and use that to populate
67:40 - the modal and then once we went to react
67:42 - we switched it up and we actually have a
67:44 - modal for each instance of the team card
67:47 - component and then we put the data
67:49 - directly in that so we didn't really
67:51 - have a need of that anymore
67:53 - so we'll just get rid of it that was
67:55 - completely unnecessary so now let's move
67:59 - on and see what's going on with this
68:01 - content
68:47 - Stephen says is it getting hung up on
68:49 - the first full yeah yeah it only doesn't
68:52 - work if if it's the first load is right
68:56 - to the team's page
69:20 - John Henson says should prop Tice be
69:22 - added to all components is it used in
69:25 - the production build or is it just for
69:28 - development troubleshooting now we
69:32 - probably don't need prop types for all
69:37 - our components you could use prop types
69:46 - prop types are nice it lets people know
69:49 - you know who are going to be using this
69:51 - like exactly the content that you should
69:53 - have I haven't used them a lot but it
69:59 - might not be a bad practice to do
70:08 - nice this is interesting okay so what
70:13 - let's look at what we are getting in the
70:15 - modal so I believe we're getting this
70:18 - this h4 which is the name and we're
70:24 - getting this title let's double check
70:25 - that whoops let me let me refresh and
70:29 - we'll double check
70:33 - yeah so we're getting the name we're
70:37 - getting the title let's see
70:48 - I I guess this is included as part of
70:51 - the title
71:09 - wait a second team cart or okay here we
71:12 - go team cart org here and then usually
71:16 - said oh no that was content hard in
71:27 - this case we're we're not going with
71:29 - content renders so we've already passed
71:31 - this down as content rendered here so as
71:36 - a prop on team card we don't need to put
71:40 - rendered we go back here
72:00 - I guess we don't really need that this
72:02 - is to being a P tag since we're getting
72:03 - P tags so I'm just gonna I don't think
72:05 - this is the problem but I am going to
72:07 - change this to div hopefully I don't
72:14 - have something going on with the styles
72:16 - for that hey hey it works
72:39 - what all right I'm gonna just verify
72:42 - again that it works interesting
72:49 - all right cool that works and it worked
72:51 - before I change this to a day of so I
72:53 - don't think that really matters but what
72:55 - did we do I don't even remember what I
73:00 - changed I don't think I changed anything
73:05 - except I remove that data from here
73:13 - right we remove that data from up here
73:17 - we restarted the server it didn't work
73:58 - and now we have this Google Analytics
74:02 - getting messed up here alright so this
74:08 - works now I guess that's okay when you
74:11 - accidentally fix a bug this for this
74:16 - page so
74:25 - I'll page you when we're running this
74:43 - okay
75:12 - this is
75:15 - all right so now there's something going
75:17 - on here with the page you I I'm not that
75:27 - worried about this as long as as long as
75:33 - it shows up client-side at some point
75:36 - and logs the page you I guess I'm fine
75:39 - with that
75:43 - I'm assuming that this got updated react
75:49 - GA so maybe something changed with that
75:55 - package so we may have to take a look at
75:59 - this package and see if anything changed
76:01 - if we're still using it properly all
76:09 - right so my timer did run out so I'm
76:12 - gonna go down to the live chat I'm gonna
76:14 - catch up with any questions that you all
76:17 - have and then we're going to wrap things
76:22 - up and I'm gonna try to find some
76:25 - caffeine
77:11 - Sebastian says does this repo have
77:14 - prettified you mean prettier
77:19 - it says if it does try running it
77:22 - without it
77:24 - you think maybe something that in there
77:26 - is causing the errors I'll try it if I
77:29 - get really stuck and can't get through
77:30 - the error so I'll take a look at the
77:32 - syntax and see if that's the case
78:02 - whoa all right so everybody were talking
78:06 - about Ally a11y so like a 11y and
78:12 - someone said they pronounce it Ally as
78:15 - well who was that I can't find it now
78:19 - oh look said that and then rook said the
78:24 - amount of characters between the a and
78:26 - the Y and the word accessibility is 11
78:29 - that's really cool so I mean I assuming
78:32 - that's where they got the name from
78:34 - that's that is pretty awesome
78:50 - John Ensign says I finally figured it
78:53 - out submit form data with fetch to PHP
78:55 - mailer gave up on Google reCAPTCHA as
78:58 - it's so hard to implement happy with my
79:00 - client side validation site is live but
79:03 - not finished so I that's awesome John
79:09 - great job on that yeah I definitely send
79:13 - it send us a link whenever you're ready
79:14 - for from people to see it I'd love to
79:17 - check it out
79:31 - okay I see the link you put in there now
79:34 - John so I'll I'll check that out after
79:39 - the stream I'm putting it in my browser
79:47 - right now so I don't forget
80:09 - all right Wow I got through the live
80:11 - chat so not not a whole lot of questions
80:13 - I did kind of go back and forth you
80:16 - clean code and chat a little bit more I
80:18 - normally do so that may explain it all
80:23 - right so not a bad stream we got a lot
80:28 - of time we worked through a lot of
80:29 - errors for the most part things are
80:32 - still working we didn't check out every
80:36 - page so you know we may run into some
80:39 - issues that are a lot more difficult but
80:41 - I feel like this is going to be doable
80:44 - and I'm glad that that we're upgrading
80:48 - everything first then we're gonna go in
80:51 - and add the new features you know change
80:54 - the layout a bit which I can share all
80:56 - that with you or if you want to preview
80:58 - some of it check out the repo and read
81:00 - the issues that I've put in recently but
81:05 - it'll be nice to take advantage of you
81:07 - know the newer versions of next and
81:09 - react and some of that you know
81:13 - performance improvement that we should
81:15 - get alright so I guess that's it for
81:23 - today thanks everyone for watching
81:26 - thanks for all your help and your
81:28 - comments and the live chat that that
81:30 - helped me a lot to kind of get through
81:32 - and figure out what was going on
81:35 - tomorrow I should be back tomorrow
81:38 - around the same time that will be my
81:39 - last stream for a while so the entire
81:44 - next week I will not be working the
81:47 - Christmas break so I won't be back until
81:49 - after the new year so I think I'm back
81:54 - January 2nd so that'll we'll see what's
81:59 - going on when I get back hopefully if I
82:01 - have time then January 2nd will then be
82:05 - when I come back for streaming so
82:08 - probably a stream tomorrow and then not
82:10 - again till January 2nd maybe I'll try to
82:14 - get some like pre-recorded videos out on
82:16 - my own YouTube channel you can find the
82:19 - link in the description to this video
82:22 - I I do have some content ready that I
82:24 - just haven't recorded yet so we'll see
82:28 - kind of defense I guess on how loud my
82:30 - kids are and if they get to sleep early
82:32 - so I can record but anyway I can't
82:36 - promise anything
82:38 - I mean if my kids get really good toys
82:41 - or video games and I want to play them I
82:43 - I might not have time to record a video
82:45 - so you know how that guess all right so
82:52 - yeah so if I don't see a John says I may
82:55 - not see tomorrow Merry Christmas Happy
82:56 - New Year see any of you tomorrow for the
83:00 - stream yeah definitely Merry Christmas
83:02 - Happy New Year and if you get in some
83:06 - time off you know definitely and enjoy
83:08 - your time off
83:09 - try not to code too much hang out with
83:11 - your family and friends you know just
83:14 - relax and and I'll see y'all some of you
83:18 - I'll see tomorrow and if I don't then
83:20 - I'll see you next year
83:21 - have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jessie welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm sorry about the delay I thought that was a long delay yeah so like a halfhour ago maybe I decided to download some updates I wanted to restart my computer anyway because if you remember yesterday the camera wasn't working and usually if I restart it works well you know for weeks so unfortunately the updates took longer than I thought so that's why I started late I was trying to get a stream going on my laptop but I couldn't get it working fast enough before the updates finished so now it's everything's working now so again sorry about that lets it's saying that the resolution is not good on this stream so let me know how it's going all right so today we're gonna start sorry I just my computer just literally came back on you know two minutes ago oh trying to get everything everything ready okay so today we're gonna start for really from from the basics so I had some feedback saying that you know a lot of you like the beginner type of stuff so I'm not always gonna be doing beginner level work but what I'll try to do more of is even when I'm doing some of the advanced work I'll try to explain the steps you know a little bit better so that you know someone who is a beginner might be able to understand so today we're gonna go back to project one so I don't know how many of you were we're watching for project one but we're gonna go all the way back there and we will update some of our packages and because we need to make some changes to that so I've already gone back into the repo and I've opened some issues with some of those changes and we'll talk more about some of the changes I think I did a few weeks ago on a stream we may do some of the changes live on a stream we'll see how it goes but I thought this might be cool to do because I'm sure a lot of us have projects that we've done before and now you know six months later a lot of the packages that we use might be out of date well you know how do you go about updating things so that you don't break them so that's what I'm gonna try to do today and I have not done anything with this I haven't practiced at all so we'll see it may not work at all we may break it so we're just gonna kind of try to update things and test and see if things work we're going to be using you'll get so we can certainly revert back if we need to we could even do things on another branch and then merge when we're certain that everything works so let's let's give it a shot so as I said before since I'm trying to do this you know for beginners I'm gonna start you know right off the bat I haven't liked any commands yet let me try to find the right it's this alert okay so let me get switch you over to the screen there we go and oh I also did put that yesterday her should asked about that electron app that we had started up but I had forgotten to make the repo for that repo is now available so that's in that that marcom that fu s Markham organization that all the other projects are in now there's a project for that of electron one Oh Blake asks if I'm in another office no I just left the light on which I don't want the light on so hold on a second there we go when I was trying to do the stream from my MacBook the camera on there was just super dark so I had to turn the light on but I can't stand the glare off the screen when the lights are on all right so let me make this bigger so you all can see so I'm just starting here right from my terminal okay I happen to be using a program called I term you can find the link for that in the description below this video but you know you don't have to use this you could use a different program you could use you know the built in terminal and like Visual Studio code or you know just the normal terminal that comes with whatever computer you're using so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go into for me I keep all my stuff in a projects folder so I just CD the command a CD and then you type the name of the folder and now I'm gonna check this out and find our here we go see I react is the name of our projects we need to go into that folder so I'm gonna CD again and go see I react once you type in the first few letters you can hit the tab key and it will assuming that there's only one file but it could be based on what you've typed in already it'll just autocomplete the rest not a big deal for short names like that but when you get into some of these longer names like like this one it's very helpful because you know one little you know mistake and the computer has no idea what you're talking about so it it won't try to guess what you meant if you accidentally misspelled a word you know in the middle here alright so first thing that we always want to do when we go into a project that's being tracked you know it has a github repository or any type of git repositories we want to do a git pool this will pull any changes oops since I restarted my computer I have to put passphrase so I'm going to grab that quickly from LastPass and I will do that on my other screen so that you all don't see my my password yeah all right I'm gonna put that in there Oh No so not it this should work let me try to copy it again there we go and then I'm gonna do SSH ad and that way I won't have to put this passcode in again at least until I restart my computer okay so now we we should be able to do let's do it get pull make sure just make sure all right yeah I did run so we're already up to date so we don't have anything in our repository so we were safe to begin working so now I want to open this up I'm gonna open it up in Visual Studio code I've been using that a lot lately we did most of this project using atom but it's fine to switch between our code editors so the shortcut for Visual Studio code if you have it installed and you've installed the commandline interface you just do code and then dot you put the dot there it opens up the whole folder there we are and now I'm gonna make this take up the full screen and let's let's open up our terminal here so our integrated terminal so now we won't have to switch back and forth we can type in our commands right here and first things first let's check out our package JSON this is what we're going to be concerned with for for most of the time so I'm going to get rid of this sidebar and I'll make that a bit bigger I hope that's big enough for everyone to see and I'm gonna move this down just a bit and I could always make it bigger when we need it so let's just let's check some things out here so we're running next to point 4.3 and we can see the latest version is four point two point one so we're way behind same way with react latest version of react is sixteen point two so we have some work to do here let's see what else so I'm just going through this just to refresh my memory on what we're doing for this project so we have Auto formatting going of our code linting set up so it's good it looks like most of what we're using can be updated alright so I just checked the live chat here harsh it says that there are no braking changes so if we run yarn upgrade latest it should work so let's do that first of all let's confirm that it is running locally right I would hate to have it that something right now that's going on be breaking it and somehow think that what we're about to do will break it so let's do let me see what we had to come in for dev ok so I'm gonna run it in this other terminal so we'll go yarn dev and hit enter and we'll see it's going to start we'll be able to check this site out in just a minute there we go we're on localhost 3000 I'm also gonna start up this end rot server we got here believe I need to do this and grog there we go I'm going to paste a link and you should be able here in the live chat you should be able to see the site as we work on it with that link and I forgot to start my timer so I'm gonna do 25 minutes of like coding updating testing and then after that I'm gonna take a fiveminute break I'm gonna go back to the live chat answer any questions that you have so if you've asked a question already just hold on till we're done with this twenty five minute period I'll answer your questions if you can't stick around for the answer you could always watch the recording of this video you know sometime later on you know whenever whenever you have time to watch it so it looks like yeah we have people connect that's working and I will pull over a browser window as well onto this screen and I will check it out the localhost 3000 great it looks like it's working use the home page is working let's click on some things okay awesome so since that's working now let's update so let me check out again what Harshit has suggested to run yarn upgrade latest and was that yes it's so down here I'll bring it up a bit so down here in our terminal we're gonna run yarn update upgrade and then we'll do latest I apologize for the yawn I haven't had very much caffeine today I had like a cup of tea and it was a really old tea bag it's been sitting in my desk drawer for like two years so wasn't the greatest cup of tea alright so just to show you how much that does this is this is what it's all you know kind of installed and went through all these packages so we have our base packages that we can see in our package JSON but they all have dependencies of other packages so I mean look at that quite a bit still scrolling yeah so we started way up here and we have all this scroll so saved 829 new dependencies it's just amazing yeah long scroll okay we did get some warnings usually these aren't really a big deal but you know if you what if you're worried about them you could always read them and then you know correct that so in this case these ones all are just saying that we have something in dependencies we have something in dev dependencies already and we were also trying to add it in our regular dependencies so not shouldn't really big be a problem for us and if it is we can switch it up later on all right so we'll do a git status just to make sure what's changed and this is perfect this is what we expected to be changed this package.json and our yard and lock so let's test it out now before we commit anything so I'm gonna go here I think it'd probably be a good idea to restart this server since we made so many changes so we're just gonna exit out so I hit ctrl C to stop that server and then I just went with another yarn dev and let's see we got a look we did gets we have a warning here okay so we have some weird stuff going on well it looks like it's still loaded so let's see what what we've got here for these warnings so each out in an array or iterator suge unique key problem okay so evidently somewhere we've forgotten to put a key fob and Reformation okay so it has given us some file names and line numbers where you can check some of these things out so maybe we can go through some of these and fix them you know what I have this air is it's saying there's no entry and another window I had I had a different project open and I was also running that on local I was 3,000 and it's still open so I'm going to close that right now so we get rid of all that mess all right okay so let's check this out see what we have going on let me let me do a hard refresh so this video shows up hmm it should have shown up I'm also gonna bring up dev tools to see if we're getting any errors in the console okay we have that key proc warning again the same the prop type warning okay all right so we do have a few things that we need to work through so that's good if we had nothing to that went wrong then it would have been a really short stream okay I am gonna doublecheck the live chat quickly just to see if I've done anything wrong so far or if you won't notice something in any of the output that I didn't catch oh here's a nice comment this is interesting so John Hanson says I run the NPM outdated it almost every time I do an editing session fingers crossed every time so I you know what I'm gonna have to keep that in mind because it's much easier to do very small incremental updates than to do like I've done here and wait months before we update something so I think that that's a good a good practice I'm gonna have to really try to train myself to make a habit of frequently updating especially when we're in the process of building something because at that time it's I mean that's really the time to change things and work out any bugs so I actually really liked that idea and we did have a question about whether or not this was an actual website it is an actual website you can find a link to it in the description it's kadek etics comm is the live version so we're working on this locally and then you all have the link to be able to see this as well using Angra right okay so it looks like the only thing I'm seeing in relation to what we've just done is Hardison saying that he's not getting an error in dev tools when he's running this through through end rot so that's that's interesting let me let me try to empty the cache as well it should already be anything since I have dev tools open but we'll see I am a little bit worried about why this video is not loading anymore let's let's go through some of these errors and fix these first and if that video is still not loading then we'll dig into it I don't know why this would be messing up the video but you never know it might fix it so we'll just try it Sanjay asks what is and rock and rock is this little commandline tool that I have here it's let me make it bigger as you can see it so I get the name of the person who made this is just slipping my mind but his Twitter handle is izzat inconceivable he very generously has kind of donated unlimited use of this to free code camp for these streams but there's a free version that has more limited use and basically what you can do is run something locally on your machine and then turn on this little commandline tool and it will give you a URL that you can share with other people and they can check out what you're doing locally in real time from anywhere as long as they have an internet connection so for these streams it's very very helpful hey harsh it's getting the errors now so normally not happy to see errors but in this case I'm glad that someone else is seeing the errors as well alright and har should also is seeing the video that's interesting all right I'm not gonna worry about the video now we'll get to it at some point okay so let's let's take these errors one by one so oops I got a better description over here oh no I didn't I didn't see this we're actually getting the good description here so that index dot Chasse and she's 73 let's see if that's if that's legit number so let's go in here to that static yep just you know what it's just where our index chance is oh it's in our pages folder that's where it is it's trying to switch back and forth between different like reacts routing systems you kind of like forget where things are that's what happened in this case I forgot that we have everything in pages when we're using next okay let's doublecheck that number where do we get 73 so let's check out 73 hmm all right so if we add in a keeper up here that should fix it so let's go with key and let's give it the key prop let's go I wonder what I'm bringing in one if we're going to the post ID let's try post ID if I am pulling that data this will work and it'll give it a unique key so let's try it out yeah it worked okay so I am bringing in well I see some some of you in the live chat we're saying I could just use the index you you can you can definitely use the index I to use the post ID as the key because it's assuming that you're getting the data from one WordPress installation you're never going to have the same key so that we'll make sure we get a unique identifier there and in cases where I don't have an ID I've used like a random number before so I think it's like UUID is the package and that will also give you a kind of a nice random number and this is just to make sure that we don't accidentally have the same values for key so basically everything you want to have a different key value all right let's check this one out seventy nav so we're gonna look in the nav component on line 73 so let's check that out where's our nav components components there we go and nav alright 73 one nice thing about next and I'm sure other frameworks have things like this but one nice thing about next is the error messages are pretty descriptive and helpful so it's usually not too bad trying to debug things all right so we have this link here and we have a hmm okay so evidently on link title is not valid to use maybe this is something that's changed in the newer version of next so this this link is something that comes with next and it has to do with the prefetching so maybe title is not available anymore I could just get rid of the title and that would be okay but instead I'd actually like to see if there's an alternative here so let's check out the documentation for next it's been quite a while since I've looked up this link tag stuff so there we go let's see so here it is in prefix you drop out the link hmm so here's our link but if we need we need more info so let's see if there's more in depth ducks that's that are linked to let's check out learn next yes calm I haven't been here for a while either I don't want that I really don't want to do the tutorial I just want to see the content okay hard saying move the title to a tag be a tag all right let's check that out okay cool that makes sense and let's see while we're on this screen this is actually very helpful so learn next J s comm will give you kind of a nice you know guide to get you started if you've never used next before John Hanson asked if next was like react router next has routing built into it so it has some elements that do behave like react router all right so I'm going to close that out and I'll close this out there's also a ton of great information just right here in the git repo for next ok so let me refresh ok it looks like we're using that same that title in another place so let's fix that now since we've just done that we're sticking I have line 15 so let's check out sticky nav line 15 oh okay and it looks like we are using this quite a bit so I'm guessing that this used to be valid at one time with next and then now it's not because obviously we would have seen all these errors before or at least you know the warnings so I'm just going to move all these down here into these a tags so if you're not familiar at all with what next does one of the cool things that it can do is prefetch pages so it can grab the HTML four pages before the user is even navigated to those pages and so that's why we've wrapped our a tags in our link tags so you don't have to prefetch with the link tag if you just put the link tag without this prefetch attribute then it'll still do clientside routing for you right so that means it's just going to work out what's going to be on the next page right there in the client there's no page refresh that happens right it doesn't have to hit the server again but the prefetch is nice and it results in much faster load times so once the user gets that initial load over with you know every click that they go to where they're you know we had that link prefetch tag is going to be nearly instantaneous and we were first testing this site after we launched it the analytics the Google Analytics were showing a load time of 0 seconds for all the interior pages so that was I was pretty excited about that I've never seen zero cents for load son okay okay harsh it did say that that change came in next three because they're not passing the tags to the a tag so they're not passing the props to the a tag so evidently before anything else that you would put on this link tag that wasn't immediately used by the link tag like this prefetch or the href we just automatically get passed down to the a tag inside so I guess that's not happening anymore so that's why it's registering as an invalid tag so good to know thanks hard oh let's see what do we have here okay so wow we're using this title I I think we're gonna be chasing around these these title attributes quite a while so let's kind of this text reveal image card and where was this at 73 wait a second 21 okay all right so let's grab that and put it down here and save okay great okay hey I think we got rid of all those linked attribute errors whoops click the wrong thing there console all right great now we can move on to another air so we have a warning I shouldn't say errors most of these are just warnings if not all of them so I mean obviously the site still working did not expect server HTML to contain a div in div okay let's see if it's telling us what it's telling us here actually I'm gonna stop this and restart it I just want to see the message again that it gives me in the console to see if there's any difference in what we're seeing in our dev tools console versus our terminal okay there's slight slight difference okay so check out team Jas and where was it saying hmm I'm not really sure what the air is here so I'm looking at this one now check the top level render call usually do we're looking at team jazz all right so my timer just went off here so we'll think about this one for a few minutes while we do to some questions so let me take a short 5minute break and I'm gonna scroll all the way up to the top of the live chat and I go through and try to get through as many questions as I can okay a hardship mentioned early in the stream that this was the react jQuery mix project yeah yeah I I should probably mention that in case some of you are checking out the repo now or the code this was an odd setup where we blended jQuery with react so I'd actually love to switch it over so we're not using any jQuery at some point I think I made an issue for that but that's going to be a really big project it's not entirely necessary right now cuz everything's working but if we ever get some time that might be a nice project to do let's see blake is asking if anyone has written batch scripts i don't really have that much experience with with writing bash script so i can't help you out too much with that okay Josh Modi'in was asking about a project that he's creating but then he had to go so sorry about that if you can if you watch this later on and you know maybe you still have some questions join us for another live stream or comment on this video you know send me a message on Twitter or something I'd be I'd be happy to talk to you about your project Phillips's could anyone recommend some package or way to play notification sounds in react app hmm I I don't know that I've ever heard of a package I've never really needed that so I've never looked at it looked for it so I don't know of any package is anybody else know of anything like that could help out Phillip a package that I would play notification sounds and a react app okay Philip asked does anyone know how to do search engine optimization with react without serverside rendering for example Facebook sharing is still showing react app as a title not sure what to do mm sorry for the on again I need some coffee or something uhhuh okay so to do it without serverside rendering yet I honestly I think the best way is with the serverside rendering if you can't do that kind of the older way to do things would to be used something like phantom Jes I think it's called which basically like will serve two crawlers like search engine crawlers or things like that a version of your site that is already been prerendered and just kind of like stored so at least that's my understanding of what those things do it I've never really used them but I have looked into using them before and I decided that the serverside rendering would be the better way to go all right my time is almost up let's see if I can get one more call it questioning looks asking about is it valid to put eight reps on the a tags inside the link tags saying JSX the its a11y but I really want to pronounce that as a lie can I do that is that a thing anyway it has to do with accessibility for like screen readers and things so anyway what I'm gonna start calling Ally wants href on the a tags I I don't really know I'd say just try it out and see if it works because it may be that it would work all right like that but I'm guessing that there are other people that have thought about that and run into that issue as well so if you try and it doesn't work I'm guessing this probably an issue for that you know or somebody's brought it up at some point okay Hart should also mentioned using puppeteer to serve up versions of your site to to crawlers so that they see you know what they should be saying yeah so I've never used puppets here so I can't personally say anything about it but you might want to check that out as well oh okay so evil has some advice for us on that that last air that we got so let's go back to the code now and let's check that out so one more Pomodoro session probably just do one more and then probably wrap things up around there we'll see we'll see in any case at the end of the stream we'll definitely you know get to all the questions that you have in the live chat all right so let's go back to okay so Evo saying you know don't you need parentheses in that map okay yeah let's let's add some parentheses here and see see what that does you know the one here right yeah should need to because we got one too right yeah okay it was giving me a red squiggly line at first I didn't understand why all right let's try this out now so we've saved it let's do a refresh here see what we get actually this this wasn't giving us what we want to eat we got that air here so let me restart the server and see what air we get see if we get the same thing I'm gonna check the live chat see if there's any other discussion about this all right that's okay we're still getting that still at the same line all right interesting Harshit I see also said try navigating right to the team page because there's still more errors there so let's check that out so we need a key prop there as well Wow was I thinking with these key props this is like something that I rarely forget now but you know was less experienced when we are doing this site like six months ago it's just kind of amazing to look back and think how did I forget key props on everything all right so let's check it out let's put a key in here and this can be just like we did before let's do a post ID okay Evo said it probably it does not need parenthesis all right well let's take him up then not a big deal alright but we didn't need to put a key in there so that's good let's check back whoa okay so did not match server the client didn't match the server that's interesting let me let me show this refresh again well that's odd I wonder mmm that's odd hearted saying check out get initial props okay I notice how I should comment Harsha's comment about puppeteer is saying that I actually have used puppets here because we were using it for NN testing you know that now that you say that I do I remember puppeteer was in there so I'm using it kind of indirectly I don't handle it it just runs when we do our test so alright so let's see I mean we should be getting I'm wondering if this may be just something weird is going on locally whoa interesting yeah when I go to it like this obviously we don't get it but when we refresh and see if we get it again yep we do okay so on refresh we get that I said you're saying and also remember for this project we have a test server on digital ocean so we can run this in production mode and see if we're still getting this kind of thing happening so we're gonna have another whole nother level of tests going on all right okay well that seems to be the only thing that we have happening now on the team page okay coach that's ko Jae I'm just gonna say coach for now correct me if that's the wrong pronunciation it says the div and a bear seems to be because you're somehow initially rendering a different tree on the client versus a server yeah I just I don't I'm not seeing right now how or why it's rendering differently let's take a look again at this page and see what we're doing in the team closer interesting this okay okay all right so they're at this page works perfectly fine when you navigate to it through the clientside routing but when you navigate through you know when it's the first load through the serverside routing it doesn't work there's just a bunch of data that's missing so harsh is saying restart the server maybe it's the cache ok yeah let's try that all right so let's restart the server see what we get mmm okay still getting this error okay still that let's try to refresh yeah still still getting that error okay John sang how I should sing show up in the terminal John sang maybe there's some inline styles that are causing that error all right so it looks like this is all we're getting on that latest restart okay so we are getting we do checkout hedge as you know what let me check this out really quickly because this seems like something that's a really easy fix so let's just do it while we see it there and then we'll go back to this team page there's five there we go all right so let's check out initially I thought we were having some issue with our jQuery but if that was the case we wouldn't be able to open these modal's so I don't think that's the problem the problem this is odd let's see we're getting here yes no we're like we're getting some data but not other data right so we get all this but not this and we should be able to get that let's see what we're doing where are we getting that data because concert rendered and this is our all right you know that's the top section so we're not worried about that but that is coming in properly right yes it is okay so let's go down here to our cards I just can't remember exactly how I did this before it's too long ago I'm trying to see where where exactly that data is getting put in for the modal there you go contents for a team card here and then the bottom modal's I'm gonna see where we have our modal's all right let's check out the team card component then this rose content all right let's check out our static JavaScript file I think I remember what was happening oh man I was using fair this is a little bit painful to watch look at this code hmm all right while we're in here I'm gonna remove these console logs because we don't need those get out of here console logs all right let me check the live chat harsh is saying isomorphic fetch seems like an error with the fetch okay let's see what I'm using here yeah I am bringing in isomorphic fetch all right let me check got a question here about this code again so we're I'm saying there this card equals this saying does that make sense it might not make sense it's been a while since I wrote this Levite when are you using this card this I don't know it's possible that it was necessary to make this variable at some point and then I changed the code and it wasn't and I never switched it back it's possible I just didn't know what I was doing and I did that unnecessarily so I'm not gonna try to refactor this right now because we're gonna completely get rid of all this jQuery at some point so I'm not gonna worry about anything in here right now only if it's like I absolutely have to fix something because it doesn't work anymore all right let's see coach is saying what is good st. component did mount is not available and rendering on the server you're setting up some data there which appears to be in conflict the conflict between the client the server okay page the team colored sections you know there shouldn't there's nothing going on with data in here this just and it's these and you can see here this is just initializing like the modal's in material materialized CSS so there shouldn't be any change of the data all it should all it should be doing is just allowing us the modal to open and then allowing us to open and close these sections okay let me check my time whoo seven minutes all right let's look at this again yeah it does seem it does seem like we're not getting that call made on the server side like like you all were saying because here when we see the server does nothing no data but then for the client we have all this I mean this is all the stuff this is only this stuff that's supposed to go see yeah yeah this is only the data that's supposed to go inside the modal let's look back at where we're putting that component in the in the modal or where we're putting that data into the modal I don't think we have a separate modal component right all right so let's see where this is it should be grabbing this data team member yeah we're grabbing all the data from the team members this is this is where we have our API calls to the WordPress API all right so that's the top section we don't need to worry about that that would do this I definitely do this differently if I were making it now but it works okay so we are putting the content we're passing that to team card all right let me check team card again I don't think we need that anymore we don't need that fixed all that let me fix that okay all right so let's see what we're doing with content okay so we have a div with a class of content we've setting it to displaynone I think we can take this out let's try taking this out let me try to restate same thing actually let me check now remember this was working if we went to it with the clientside so let me make sure I didn't mess it that up as well now it's still there see so that section that we had before was completely unnecessary so that was probably left over from initially before we turned this into react the way we're doing the modal's was unclick it grabbed the data from that particular div and then because you're clicking on this container dev so we're gonna grab the data within it and use that to populate the modal and then once we went to react we switched it up and we actually have a modal for each instance of the team card component and then we put the data directly in that so we didn't really have a need of that anymore so we'll just get rid of it that was completely unnecessary so now let's move on and see what's going on with this content Stephen says is it getting hung up on the first full yeah yeah it only doesn't work if if it's the first load is right to the team's page John Henson says should prop Tice be added to all components is it used in the production build or is it just for development troubleshooting now we probably don't need prop types for all our components you could use prop types prop types are nice it lets people know you know who are going to be using this like exactly the content that you should have I haven't used them a lot but it might not be a bad practice to do nice this is interesting okay so what let's look at what we are getting in the modal so I believe we're getting this this h4 which is the name and we're getting this title let's double check that whoops let me let me refresh and we'll double check yeah so we're getting the name we're getting the title let's see I I guess this is included as part of the title wait a second team cart or okay here we go team cart org here and then usually said oh no that was content hard in this case we're we're not going with content renders so we've already passed this down as content rendered here so as a prop on team card we don't need to put rendered we go back here I guess we don't really need that this is to being a P tag since we're getting P tags so I'm just gonna I don't think this is the problem but I am going to change this to div hopefully I don't have something going on with the styles for that hey hey it works what all right I'm gonna just verify again that it works interesting all right cool that works and it worked before I change this to a day of so I don't think that really matters but what did we do I don't even remember what I changed I don't think I changed anything except I remove that data from here right we remove that data from up here we restarted the server it didn't work and now we have this Google Analytics getting messed up here alright so this works now I guess that's okay when you accidentally fix a bug this for this page so I'll page you when we're running this okay this is all right so now there's something going on here with the page you I I'm not that worried about this as long as as long as it shows up clientside at some point and logs the page you I guess I'm fine with that I'm assuming that this got updated react GA so maybe something changed with that package so we may have to take a look at this package and see if anything changed if we're still using it properly all right so my timer did run out so I'm gonna go down to the live chat I'm gonna catch up with any questions that you all have and then we're going to wrap things up and I'm gonna try to find some caffeine Sebastian says does this repo have prettified you mean prettier it says if it does try running it without it you think maybe something that in there is causing the errors I'll try it if I get really stuck and can't get through the error so I'll take a look at the syntax and see if that's the case whoa all right so everybody were talking about Ally a11y so like a 11y and someone said they pronounce it Ally as well who was that I can't find it now oh look said that and then rook said the amount of characters between the a and the Y and the word accessibility is 11 that's really cool so I mean I assuming that's where they got the name from that's that is pretty awesome John Ensign says I finally figured it out submit form data with fetch to PHP mailer gave up on Google reCAPTCHA as it's so hard to implement happy with my client side validation site is live but not finished so I that's awesome John great job on that yeah I definitely send it send us a link whenever you're ready for from people to see it I'd love to check it out okay I see the link you put in there now John so I'll I'll check that out after the stream I'm putting it in my browser right now so I don't forget all right Wow I got through the live chat so not not a whole lot of questions I did kind of go back and forth you clean code and chat a little bit more I normally do so that may explain it all right so not a bad stream we got a lot of time we worked through a lot of errors for the most part things are still working we didn't check out every page so you know we may run into some issues that are a lot more difficult but I feel like this is going to be doable and I'm glad that that we're upgrading everything first then we're gonna go in and add the new features you know change the layout a bit which I can share all that with you or if you want to preview some of it check out the repo and read the issues that I've put in recently but it'll be nice to take advantage of you know the newer versions of next and react and some of that you know performance improvement that we should get alright so I guess that's it for today thanks everyone for watching thanks for all your help and your comments and the live chat that that helped me a lot to kind of get through and figure out what was going on tomorrow I should be back tomorrow around the same time that will be my last stream for a while so the entire next week I will not be working the Christmas break so I won't be back until after the new year so I think I'm back January 2nd so that'll we'll see what's going on when I get back hopefully if I have time then January 2nd will then be when I come back for streaming so probably a stream tomorrow and then not again till January 2nd maybe I'll try to get some like prerecorded videos out on my own YouTube channel you can find the link in the description to this video I I do have some content ready that I just haven't recorded yet so we'll see kind of defense I guess on how loud my kids are and if they get to sleep early so I can record but anyway I can't promise anything I mean if my kids get really good toys or video games and I want to play them I I might not have time to record a video so you know how that guess all right so yeah so if I don't see a John says I may not see tomorrow Merry Christmas Happy New Year see any of you tomorrow for the stream yeah definitely Merry Christmas Happy New Year and if you get in some time off you know definitely and enjoy your time off try not to code too much hang out with your family and friends you know just relax and and I'll see y'all some of you I'll see tomorrow and if I don't then I'll see you next year have a great day
