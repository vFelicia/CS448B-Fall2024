00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with Jesse I'm Jesse and I haven't
00:10 - streamed in a while so yesterday or not
00:13 - yesterday last week almost everyone in
00:18 - my family was sick so I took Wednesday
00:23 - Thursday and Friday off so first I was
00:26 - taking care of sick people and then I
00:28 - was sick and so I'm not a hundred
00:31 - percent yet but I'm almost almost there
00:36 - so sorry about not streaming today we're
00:42 - gonna just pick up where we left off on
00:44 - Tuesday yeah Tuesday was the last stream
00:48 - so for me I'm just I'm just picking this
00:51 - up so I haven't really done much I hope
00:55 - to be able to get some work done from
00:57 - home but I didn't really get that much
00:58 - done I was just exhausted so hey
01:04 - everyone see you on the live chat there
01:08 - I'm gonna get started by starting up the
01:11 - end Rock server and I'm gonna paste the
01:14 - link to that in the live chat so oh I'll
01:25 - try to remember to paste it again in a
01:26 - few minutes for the people that maybe
01:28 - are coming in later that I don't know if
01:30 - you can if you come in late can you
01:32 - still see everything in the live chat or
01:35 - do you just see like the last few things
01:38 - that happen I don't know let me know
01:42 - I'll probably still post it again no
01:43 - matter what just to be sure I do want to
01:47 - ask you a question so I had you know
01:49 - someone who watches the the live chat
01:52 - has been asking some questions on
01:54 - Twitter and I keep forgetting to ask you
01:57 - all because I'm not sure what the answer
01:58 - is but they're creating a like a online
02:03 - shopping cart so this is like an
02:06 - e-commerce site and they're using react
02:08 - so they're having trouble with their
02:12 - you know with getting things to show up
02:15 - in the cart so I'm not I haven't seen
02:18 - the code so I don't know everything
02:20 - that's going on but if anyone has done
02:24 - any e-commerce stuff with react and you
02:26 - have any suggestions or you know any
02:30 - maybe like packages or something that
02:33 - would help with that please let me know
02:35 - in the live chat or you know through
02:38 - some other means comments or on Twitter
02:40 - or something and I will forward that
02:42 - information alone because I've never
02:46 - done e-commerce with with react before
02:48 - so I'm not really I don't really have
02:52 - the experience to be able to give good
02:54 - advice in that area but I would still
02:55 - like to help if possible okay where we
03:03 - left off last week and we were we
03:06 - created a switch statement and we were
03:09 - using sort so we were mapping through
03:12 - our data and then we were using dot sort
03:17 - to sort everything in different ways so
03:21 - we didn't quite get that working so
03:24 - there's a problem with somehow how I set
03:27 - up the the sort the sorting functions so
03:33 - I've started to look at the
03:35 - documentation because we copy and pasted
03:38 - from previous project where the sorting
03:40 - works I think the problem is the data
03:44 - that I'm getting in now is different
03:46 - from the data I was getting in in the
03:47 - other application so that's where we're
03:52 - gonna start and trying to get this to
03:54 - work and this is not going to be a
03:58 - really long stream so I did I got a
04:00 - question about how long will the stream
04:02 - be normally the streams end up being
04:04 - between like one and two hours
04:08 - I'm gonna save like an hour and a half
04:10 - is about average today I can only I
04:15 - could probably stream for an hour and a
04:17 - half today and and it would be ok but I
04:19 - can't go longer than an hour and a half
04:21 - because I have something at 12:45 so
04:25 - there's actually
04:25 - in office st. Patrick's Day parties the
04:28 - st. Patrick's Day was on Saturday
04:30 - obviously no one was working on Saturday
04:32 - so the party is today which is why I'm
04:37 - wearing green it doesn't look green on
04:38 - the camera though but this is a green
04:40 - sweater but anyway I want to go to that
04:44 - party and I think there's going to be
04:48 - really good food there which I'm excited
04:50 - about so that's why the stream is not
04:55 - going to be too long so I better stop
04:59 - talking and get to coding let me switch
05:02 - my screen here okay so here you can see
05:06 - I was looking at the documentation here
05:08 - and I noticed that when we're comparing
05:10 - numbers this actually works and that's
05:14 - really what we're doing let me start my
05:17 - time with as well and I'm gonna paste
05:22 - that and grogg link one more time for
05:25 - those who are just joining us I think we
05:27 - had about maybe 20 people join since the
05:30 - last time I posted it so there's the
05:32 - link you'll be able to see the site with
05:36 - that link so you can see that's what
05:39 - we're doing here we're just you know
05:41 - taking a and B all right the values of a
05:44 - and B and we're doing a minus B so the
05:47 - difference being we're not we don't have
05:51 - numbers and this is what I I wanted to
05:55 - see these are numbers so they should
05:58 - work where they should daily should be
06:01 - numbers so I want to double check and
06:03 - make sure like are we actually getting
06:06 - numbers what like what are we getting
06:09 - you know before I start changing these
06:12 - around you know how we're doing this I
06:14 - want to be sure of what Dana that we
06:17 - have and I see there are some questions
06:21 - in the live chat I'll answer all the
06:23 - questions when I take a little break so
06:25 - after about another 25 minutes I'm going
06:27 - to take a little break and I'm going to
06:28 - answer all the questions so please be
06:31 - patient with me
06:32 - and I'll try to get to all your
06:33 - questions before I before I finish today
06:38 - okay so let me first let's go to the the
06:44 - output that we're getting from the
06:47 - WordPress API hmm and my stream is
06:51 - getting some weirdness let me plug in I
06:56 - forgot to plug in my ethernet cord where
07:00 - do that
07:03 - alright I found it you have a like I
07:08 - can't see the back of my Mac right now
07:11 - so I'm just trying to feel around there
07:13 - we go alright hopefully that will keep
07:17 - the stream a little bit more stable it
07:21 - shouldn't cut out while switching yeah
07:27 - it's not cutting out okay cool and all
07:35 - right so so far it looks a little bit
07:36 - more stable at least on my end it wasn't
07:39 - my work wasn't getting any warnings
07:42 - about stream quality from YouTube but
07:44 - from OBS it was showing me red and
07:48 - meaning that my my internet speed was
07:53 - not not good enough okay all right so
08:01 - let's let's check out the data and I did
08:04 - have hmm I wonder if I still have it
08:08 - over here
08:09 - no yeah here we go
08:12 - oops wrong one there we go okay so
08:16 - here's our date here's what we get from
08:19 - date okay and it is a string so I'm
08:22 - gonna copy that and let's go over let's
08:28 - go over here
08:33 - let's do dates parse and then we'll put
08:39 - that string in and let's see what we get
08:42 - okay so we do actually get a number
08:52 - let's see
08:58 - well this work I can't ever remember
09:00 - with the sin taxes for this let's see no
09:06 - shoot I mean this this does look like a
09:12 - number so I think we're safe with that
09:16 - okay so I think we are getting numbers
09:22 - oh okay I get so Anthony's saying just
09:31 - use type of want to go three oh okay did
09:37 - I use the wrong whoops oh my god no
09:43 - capital okay no Calvin or thank you all
09:50 - right cool it is a number so just wanted
09:53 - to check all right so we have numbers so
09:55 - these dates should work and I say okay
10:04 - so let's see what's happening with this
10:06 - function so when you sort by we're
10:10 - passing in the type which is the type
10:21 - when does this get called alright here
10:27 - we go so we're we're manually passing in
10:30 - the type date oldest okay now we're
10:41 - manually passing in that site so it
10:48 - should
10:55 - this should work let's see make sure I'm
11:02 - not doing anything in here that would
11:04 - mess it up all right we might be getting
11:14 - more than a hundred posts let's see what
11:19 - we were searching by make sure we're not
11:21 - getting more than a hundred pose let's
11:31 - all right so we're only getting fifty
11:33 - three posts all right I remember going
11:34 - through this the less I mean through
11:37 - this process okay and we're logging out
11:43 - here's our dates three five twenty
11:58 - so this is showing the newest first
12:04 - which is not what we want let's change
12:08 - this and see if maybe we haven't
12:11 - reversed made newest
12:26 - [Music]
12:28 - hey Harsha how's it going I'm glad this
12:33 - time worked for you
12:39 - biology will work ok not it's the same
12:49 - order
13:02 - who
13:25 - hmm
13:30 - okay hey everyone I see ladies in high
13:35 - enough shoot
13:49 - all right what's going on what am I
13:52 - doing wrong
14:01 - you look back it was my original sedate
14:07 - oldest I date oldest forgiveness
14:16 - it was my time soon
14:47 - okay let me
15:06 - I wonder
15:16 - if these are even running let's see
15:41 - let's let's see what can I do with this
15:45 - can I put something else in here oops
16:17 - okay
16:29 - okay so that is should be running date
16:34 - analyst whoa okay
16:39 - it ran a lot of times because we're
16:43 - mapping over it I take newest so it is
16:47 - getting the type sort of data exists a
16:56 - data that's a log sort data
17:14 - so does sorted data actually just
17:19 - Francois chief I use so what is data sir
17:21 - okay so I wasn't trying to save anything
17:28 - to a variable here I was just sort and
17:33 - then I was mapping I don't know why I
17:41 - said we were mapping and sorting we're
17:43 - not mapping and sorting so I apologize
17:46 - for saying that earlier let's see okay
17:58 - so we need let me see what sort does we
18:06 - have a variable here that stores the
18:13 - elements of an array in place and
18:15 - returns the array this source not
18:18 - necessarily saying all the default
18:20 - orders at Clooney's she could finish
18:27 - okay we did check this before so if we
18:31 - have an existing array and we run sort
18:39 - on it it will change that array okay
18:44 - that's we needed to know all right so
18:47 - let's go whoa hey maybe this is the
18:50 - problem maybe that should not have been
18:55 - Const let's try that out
19:00 - I hope that is really the the answer to
19:02 - this okay
19:12 - all right so new lists I don't really
19:17 - know since that's new list first I guess
19:20 - we could check
19:22 - all right let's change this to oldest
19:36 - do the work
19:45 - no what's it boy hold on a second okay
19:51 - so it's working briefly haha I don't
19:57 - know if you'll see this
19:58 - you could probably try it out on your
20:00 - machines now if you have the N grout
20:02 - link okay so when I hit enter it briefly
20:09 - sorts everything correctly and then it
20:12 - goes back to the normal way so why is it
20:17 - doing that all right let's see what
20:20 - we're doing
20:21 - so this whereby the oldest okay great
21:16 - let's see what we're logging here
21:20 - alright so this is sort of the right way
21:23 - this is sorted the right way since 1750
21:29 - yeah this one's sorted the right way all
21:31 - right so we're getting and the spots
21:36 - where we're console logging we're
21:40 - getting the data in the right order
21:48 - let's see where all right so we have a
21:51 - console log here so at this point that's
21:56 - this weird
22:17 - whoa oh forget my plus sign there we go
22:29 - that was a lot of red all of a sudden
22:40 - now I should've known that what happened
23:05 - alright there may be a better way to do
23:07 - that but this will work
23:17 - okay so why so we can see our dates here
23:25 - and we're getting I should move this up
23:31 - so y'all can see everything so we're
23:35 - getting the dates initially in order
23:44 - from the oldest to the newest it looks
23:53 - like yeah and then afterwards it's still
24:04 - in that same order but what's displayed
24:11 - here is not in that order all right let
24:17 - me get a little the live chat and see
24:18 - what you all think
24:39 - okay
24:55 - yeah okay I see so harsh it's saying use
24:58 - moment Jess I'm not really doing
25:00 - anything with the dates I just need
25:03 - I just want eat numbers so I just need
25:05 - to turn the date into a number and and
25:08 - I'm doing that the problem I have now is
25:11 - I need to sort them properly
25:19 - all right so Joey sing the sorting will
25:25 - will actually modify the array that's
25:28 - act that's what I want right now so
25:30 - that's that's the behavior that I want I
25:32 - want the array to be modified
25:44 - see
25:55 - it's okay let's alright so the problem
26:05 - now
26:05 - I think our sorting is actually working
26:08 - so things things are sorting differently
26:11 - depending on the values we pass in so
26:13 - just to double-check that
26:15 - let's pass in what are we using right
26:19 - now oldest let's go back to newest just
26:28 - to see that there's definitely a
26:30 - difference in the order the newest yep
26:41 - there's a difference even this is wild
26:47 - why are we getting the difference
27:06 - all right why are we getting the
27:08 - difference though even here and in the
27:13 - same data so our console law bits here
27:20 - should not be reordering right so at
27:28 - this point we haven't even called this
27:33 - sorting function
27:55 - this dangerous
28:34 - actually let's do this
28:56 - all right we are getting some change
28:59 - recession
29:20 - we have the exact same date for some of
29:24 - these
29:36 - hey see you later oh [ __ ]
29:56 - all right I'm gonna switch back to
29:58 - oldest because we were seeing definitely
30:04 - a different change okay so we're still
30:14 - getting that switch I was afraid we had
30:17 - something going on you know with what
30:21 - this may be running before it was
30:23 - supposed to but it doesn't look like
30:25 - that was doing anything let's see see
30:36 - michael says type isn't getting logged
30:38 - yeah our type is getting log here so
30:44 - when we're running these console logs
30:47 - here it is actually see date oldest is
30:54 - running
31:34 - all right let me take a break because
31:36 - the timer ran out and I'm gonna answer
31:39 - some questions now and then we'll come
31:41 - back to it and I think we can get in one
31:45 - more Pomodoro session okay so I'm gonna
31:49 - scroll up
31:57 - Anthony asked if I was using WordPress
31:59 - as the backend
32:00 - I am so we are getting data from
32:02 - WordPress I mean I I don't know if I
32:07 - would call it the complete backend
32:08 - there's more going on but WordPress is
32:12 - our content management system so we're
32:16 - using it just for that we're not using
32:18 - any of the display portion of word for
32:23 - us
32:36 - mmm D she hub says how many time
32:40 - completed this course I'm not sure what
32:44 - you I'm not sure what you mean let me
32:46 - know maybe if you could clarify yeah so
32:53 - I'm just not exactly sure we're here
32:55 - what you're asking
32:59 - Thao asks if building what am i what am
33:02 - i building University website yep
33:04 - so building a new website for Franciscan
33:07 - University Michael said early start
33:17 - again yeah early start I have stuff
33:20 - going on in the afternoon so how to get
33:23 - it in early
33:39 - Kishor says how to set how to do this
33:42 - setup in windows / linux the git repo
33:45 - and everything yeah you can it should
33:52 - run Linux for sure it should run Windows
33:56 - I think it runs on Windows does anybody
33:59 - run this on their machine on Windows I
34:02 - think it works but I haven't personally
34:04 - tried it yeah but all you would need to
34:08 - do is just clone clone the repo and to
34:15 - your local machine and then do NPM
34:20 - install or yarn if you use yarn and then
34:25 - after all the packages are installed
34:27 - then just do NPM run dev yeah I think
34:32 - it's def there are instructions on this
34:34 - repo as well so if you go to the
34:38 - repository links in the description if
34:40 - you go there and just view the readme it
34:43 - will have instructions for how to get
34:44 - this up and running all right Bhargav
34:56 - says what are you doing which language
34:59 - it's it's JavaScript and we're using
35:03 - react which is a JavaScript library and
35:06 - in particular we're trying to sort some
35:08 - numbers
35:16 - so also a switch app in which I'm Mac so
35:20 - I'm on I I don't know my iMac is 20 I'll
35:29 - just show you I'll show you the stats
35:32 - for the spec so I guess it's really
35:38 - small so it's uh retina 5k 27-inch late
35:43 - 2014 I got the intel core i7 and 32
35:48 - gigabytes of ram and i'm using Visual
35:53 - Studio code Dimitri asks how old am I
36:01 - I am 32 years old all right cool Joey
36:08 - confirms that it does work on Windows
36:11 - excellent Thank You Joey okay all right
36:18 - and get through the questions just in
36:20 - time so let me go we'll start another
36:23 - Pomodoro session a few seconds early and
36:27 - let's let's check quickly let me bring
36:31 - this down a bit and let's get out of
36:33 - node I'd like to run through this
36:39 - briefly just to get an idea of the logic
36:43 - of what's happening okay so all right so
36:52 - initially our our data in state is it's
36:55 - totally empty which is what we want
37:11 - so when when we initiate the search so
37:23 - this is called get search results and
37:29 - pinnacles debounce search so it sets the
37:34 - the value in state so we have that we
37:38 - call debounce search which then calls
37:40 - fetch search term and now word fetch
37:42 - search term so now it just builds the
37:46 - the search query and now we're calling
37:50 - get JSON which we've imported from
37:54 - another file which simply just uses the
37:57 - fetch API so now we're passing it that
38:02 - string that we've just created and then
38:05 - we're getting the data and we're setting
38:07 - that data into into state so now data
38:10 - has all of the posts that have been
38:13 - returned from the WordPress API then
38:17 - we're console logging what that data is
38:20 - then we're calling sort by and in this
38:25 - case we're sorting by date oldest so now
38:28 - let's go down to sort by so actually so
38:37 - let's so we've had at this point we've
38:40 - had one change in state so let's see
38:47 - what would happen then so you've had a
38:49 - change in state so we're gonna get a
38:50 - rerender and now down here data dot
39:00 - length will be greater than zero since
39:03 - we had data so
39:04 - then we're gonna map over it so we're
39:07 - mapping over everything great hmm
39:33 - we could move the sorting logic down
39:36 - here I really don't want to but that's
39:41 - how I did it in a previous project and I
39:44 - know it worked there who wouldn't
39:47 - actually be manipulating the data that's
39:49 - in state instead we would just be
39:59 - changing it about in terms of how we
40:01 - display it let's let's let's move it
40:19 - down to here that'll simplify things
40:22 - we'll be able to get rid of some of the
40:24 - stuff that we're doing right now and
40:26 - it'll be a good candidate for a refactor
40:30 - at some point but we can get rid of a
40:34 - lot of this so we'll just comment some
40:38 - some of this out for now so that we can
40:41 - easily you refactor back to something
40:45 - like this later so let's grab just this
40:49 - part this sort and we're gonna copy that
40:57 - and then for all of this goodness for
41:06 - all of this we're just gonna comment
41:11 - that out now we can do let's do our
41:15 - sorting before we map obviously and so
41:21 - now we're gonna get the data we're gonna
41:23 - sort the data and let's know what all
41:31 - right so instead of tight how do we do
41:36 - this
41:37 - you go back here okay we have the
41:42 - sorting saved in a Redux tour but let's
41:46 - save the sorting in State this time
42:00 - if you do this oh yeah let's get rid of
42:08 - these console us
42:09 - it's wondering why I had typed so many
42:11 - times in there okay great now we'll say
42:17 - this state sort by and I think we
42:25 - already have this in in state so we'll
42:28 - just set it manually and then so after
42:32 - this happens then it will then map over
42:36 - everything okay let's give this a try we
42:40 - do need to set sort by and we'll go
42:45 - dates oldest okay refresh let's try that
42:59 - out so we can see right now the newest
43:03 - is shilling showing first now let's hit
43:09 - enter you gotta be kidding me
43:19 - I'm getting the phone call so let's say
43:22 - you did hello hey how's it going
43:27 - sure
43:34 - mm-hmm yes
43:46 - hmm
43:58 - okay
44:03 - yeah you probably maybe we can
44:09 - conditionally have that load so when it
44:14 - load on the editing pages yeah
44:40 - okay all right let me see yeah let me
44:46 - see what what form are you working on
44:47 - right now anything in particular
44:59 - okay
45:04 - yeah yeah just make yeah make sure that
45:07 - that I have access and I can see it and
45:10 - I'll check it out and then I'll try the
45:11 - like the conditional loading of the
45:14 - styles and make sure it works but if it
45:17 - works then I'll apply it to all the
45:19 - other forms that we're using their
45:20 - styles for all right yeah no problem
45:25 - okay all right so that was one of my
45:32 - colleagues in the IT department it seems
45:35 - that a project that we worked on earlier
45:40 - which was adding styles system
45:45 - Salesforce forms gentleman think those
45:48 - particular forms that he was talking
45:50 - about I don't think I live stream that I
45:51 - did live stream some other forms we were
45:54 - working on but the problem is when you
45:57 - go to load the editor page for those
46:00 - forms the Styles are being applied and
46:04 - they're messing up the interface so they
46:07 - look fine to the normal user when they
46:09 - go to fill out the form but when someone
46:13 - an ite or somewhere else on campus tries
46:15 - to go to the admin panel and edit
46:18 - doesn't look good so I'm thinking like
46:23 - you probably heard what if I just add
46:26 - something to where you know if if
46:32 - there's a certain string that we can
46:35 - find in the URL that make the notes that
46:38 - this is an editing page then maybe we
46:40 - don't load the Styles something like
46:42 - that let's see yeah let's keep working
46:49 - on this for now because it's probably
46:50 - going to take them a few minutes to get
46:54 - the form give me access to the form that
46:58 - they're working on to the test form so I
47:00 - thought about maybe like just switching
47:05 - over knowing that right now but I don't
47:07 - think I don't think that'll work out
47:11 - okay so in it for now let's see
47:16 - a Jew
47:32 - okay I was trying to check to make sure
47:34 - that these different types weren't all
47:37 - getting grouped together and they're not
47:39 - so we can see there's your 26
47:45 - that's interesting so this is definitely
47:49 - out of order all right so we have
47:51 - something for 2018 down below 2017 here
47:55 - and then 2018
48:10 - yes so the order is not even really
48:12 - working the sorting is not working at
48:16 - all
48:17 - let me make sure I did save that and
48:23 - we'll do a refresh actually ask you sir
48:42 - did it work this time by 2017 15 15 18
48:54 - 18 18 18 18
49:02 - 20:18 one
49:11 - six yeah I think it worked
49:18 - nice okay cool so that works let's
49:22 - switch this to make sure it works now
49:25 - the aides newest all right now it's
49:34 - switched over here great and now we
49:38 - should be able to go in here
49:41 - can we change state in here and have it
49:44 - give us a rear ender I think we can sort
49:53 - by let's switch it up yeah hey sorted to
50:05 - newest mom back to oldest
50:12 - whoops there we go oldest cool alright
50:15 - that works so now on a state change we
50:19 - have a change here awesome
50:23 - okay cool let me check my time I still
50:28 - good on time now the next thing that we
50:32 - had was this alphabetical order and I
50:39 - don't think that this will work as we're
50:44 - doing it here but let's I don't know
50:48 - let's just give it a shot
50:50 - it'll only take a second and if it works
50:53 - it'll save a lot of time
51:06 - yeah that does not look like
51:08 - alphabetical order yeah and definitely
51:15 - not okay so that's not working so this
51:25 - setup here does work what we need to do
51:29 - though is get the the alphabetical order
51:33 - working so we'll just need to change
51:35 - what's here and what's here and then
51:40 - we'll be all set with with the logic of
51:42 - it the next step then would be to tie it
51:45 - in to the UI so to make some sort of a
51:48 - drop-down radio button something like
51:50 - that and have that set the state for
51:55 - sort by and then everything else will
51:58 - work this I really don't like having all
52:05 - this right here in the component but it
52:10 - it does make things it uses less code
52:15 - than our other solution really
52:23 - yeah so I don't know maybe I'll leave it
52:25 - like this let me know y'all think we'll
52:32 - see we'll see how much gets added to
52:34 - when we try to do alphabetical order
52:58 - okay well let's go back to our
53:03 - documentation and let's see so by
53:09 - default we do have alphabetical order
53:11 - when using sort
53:37 - hmm
53:45 - buffoon idiot the array
54:29 - all right this is where we could
54:32 - probably put in here greater than or
54:34 - less than right let's try that out
55:06 - wait a second nice we have a string
55:11 - right here console
55:29 - disorder any sort
55:38 - and that's sort of a it looks like this
55:46 - sorted this string in alphabetical order
55:50 - but it used this which is what we're
55:53 - currently using so this was string array
55:59 - dot sort right or no did it not use
56:05 - compare numbers there it didn't it just
56:07 - you sort okay all right sorry I misread
56:12 - that
56:13 - okay so then yeah let's let's try the
56:18 - greater than less then see what we get
56:36 - right let me I'm gonna check the live
56:39 - chat just for a second okay Evo says hey
56:49 - those are going and ego says couldn't
56:51 - you extract the date parsing code into
56:53 - separate function which removes a few
56:56 - lines of the current component yeah you
56:59 - know what I've been thinking about that
57:00 - I think that's a good idea I'm just not
57:02 - I haven't really thought about how I'd
57:03 - do it but you know if we're repeating
57:05 - ourselves four times here there's got to
57:07 - be a better way to do it so yeah I mean
57:12 - right now it's it's not a huge deal
57:14 - right it's only four times it doesn't
57:16 - take up that much space but I'd still
57:17 - rather be able to do it I'm afraid like
57:20 - the solution to this would end up taking
57:22 - up more lines than what we have now
57:25 - really but it does make me want to you
57:31 - know pull this out and have a different
57:33 - function all right so I'm gonna try to
57:38 - just add in a greater than sign and see
57:41 - what happens
57:44 - let's give it a refresh and see did I
57:50 - change this up here officer let's change
57:54 - it whoops let's change it up here
58:01 - okay so right off the bat we'll have
58:04 - that and
59:09 - okay
59:12 - it doesn't look like this is doing
59:14 - anything let me make sure I'm title
59:19 - rendered okay damn one by title let's
59:29 - see what kind of change we have let's
59:33 - just do it this way so we have these a
59:42 - and B reversed so that's why I'm just
59:43 - going with greater than both times and
59:50 - let's see what I want to do is sort it
59:56 - this way and then change state over here
60:08 - and let's go alright so something
60:15 - happened
60:27 - it's not quite right it's haha so a
60:36 - change is happening but it's not quite
60:39 - alphabetical okay
60:47 - Joey says in the sort docs there's an
60:48 - example sort by name that may be
60:50 - relevant okay cool let's check it out
60:59 - oops my timer is up so maybe we'll have
61:03 - to check that out
61:18 - ah
61:33 - maybe we should do something like this
61:37 - then okay that'll probably be the next
61:41 - thing that that I'll try what's this Eva
61:47 - says playing game that was advocate
61:49 - maybe but you could use lodash to do
61:52 - this for you okay all right what what in
62:01 - lodash then would help is there like a
62:03 - sorting thing in low - that would help
62:05 - us out with this I kind of think we're
62:08 - pretty close I wish that if I was gonna
62:10 - use low - I wish I would have known
62:12 - about it last week uh-huh but add a to
62:19 - lower case maybe yeah I guess we could I
62:27 - could do to lower case I'm trying to
62:29 - think if the titles yeah you know what
62:34 - I'm not I'm sure that the titles are all
62:37 - the same case okay well I have to yeah
62:42 - I've got to answer questions now in the
62:44 - live chat and this so if if you're kind
62:54 - of wondering how we're gonna solve this
62:56 - I made you stream it tomorrow but if I
63:00 - don't and let's say I fix it before then
63:02 - this is probably what I'm gonna use
63:04 - something like this and this may be a
63:08 - good candidate to just use a separate
63:10 - function for since we really just care
63:13 - about returning you know like one or
63:17 - negative one okay
63:35 - all right so let me go back let's um
63:41 - let's commit this and then push it up to
63:47 - github that way you all will have all
63:49 - this code to check out as well
64:02 - that is good good add we're gonna get
64:07 - added we just gonna add everything just
64:10 - with a period there and then we'll do
64:13 - our yarn cm this is kind of a little
64:16 - custom thing we have set up to help you
64:20 - know walk someone through doing a nice
64:24 - commit message so let's say that is a
64:30 - new feature and this is gonna be a date
64:40 - logic to search no I don't think so
64:54 - all right let's see if we passed the
64:56 - test
65:04 - looks pretty good so far I think this is
65:06 - gonna work yay and now all right all
65:18 - this code is now on github and I will
65:26 - scroll up a bit and try to answer all
65:29 - the questions
66:07 - okay kiss sure says NPM is not working
66:10 - with with get for Windows I'm not sure I
66:20 - mean I it's really hard for me to tell
66:22 - what the problem is
66:23 - you know without being able to see
66:25 - what's going on you think I don't think
66:31 - we need a specific version of node for
66:34 - this project I'm not sure I mean I'd say
66:40 - you know make sure node is up-to-date
66:42 - and an NPM they're up to date you can
66:46 - use yarn if you want and it's all yarn
66:48 - and use that that's what we're using
66:58 - let's see but I'm not sure I pronounce
67:04 - the name is being har gh8 V so sorry I
67:08 - don't know how to pronounce that let me
67:09 - know the correct way to pronounce it and
67:12 - I will do my best to say it correctly
67:16 - but anyway they asked from where I
67:19 - learned coding so you can learn coding
67:22 - from free code camp so free code camp
67:26 - dot work has a lot of challenges to walk
67:30 - you through learning front-end
67:33 - programming first and then you do all
67:36 - the way through back end and so it's
67:38 - it's somewhat comprehensive it's going
67:41 - to be a lot of JavaScript so if you're
67:43 - interested in JavaScript that would be
67:45 - good otherwise there are some other
67:46 - programs like Udacity has some good
67:51 - courses on a variety of different things
67:54 - so everything from you know web
67:56 - development to self-driving cars they
67:59 - have a lot of stuff and for that kind of
68:04 - a beginner level code Academy has a lot
68:08 - of good beginner tutorials so I'd say
68:13 - those three places are a good place to
68:15 - start
68:26 - oh they also asked which programming
68:28 - language is best for me I'm a complete
68:31 - beginner yeah I I mean I started out
68:37 - with JavaScript mostly I think it was a
68:42 - good language to start with because you
68:44 - don't need really anything special to
68:46 - start out with it the browser you can
68:49 - just start doing stuff in the console on
68:51 - your browser but you know there's a good
68:55 - argument to be made that other
68:57 - programming languages are easy so
68:59 - kishore says like for a beginner Python
69:03 - and C is a start-up I thought is nice
69:07 - because there's a lot less in terms of
69:11 - syntax to have to remember at first so
69:16 - that would be a good place to start it
69:17 - does kind of depend on what you want to
69:19 - do apology say I was trying to hold back
69:27 - this yawn for a while now and I couldn't
69:30 - do it any longer
69:36 - yeah so I would say of of the three so
69:41 - Kishore mentions HTML CSS and JavaScript
69:43 - if you want to be a web developer so for
69:45 - sure if you want to do web stuff for
69:47 - sure start with that you're going to be
69:51 - using you know JavaScript most of the
69:53 - time as a web developer so especially if
69:57 - you're doing more front-end stuff but
70:00 - otherwise if you don't want to do ever
70:02 - you're not sure what you want to do then
70:05 - I I would say Python Kishore also
70:08 - mentioned C C's a good place to get like
70:12 - some really basic stuff and to
70:14 - understand like a lot of concepts that
70:17 - you don't even have to think about when
70:18 - you do JavaScript and C like like the
70:23 - type of variable that you're setting
70:26 - Java you never have to really like think
70:29 - beforehand all right what type is this
70:31 - going to be right you don't have to say
70:33 - like is this gonna be a 32-bit integer
70:35 - or something like that right but in
70:39 - other some other languages and C is like
70:42 - this you really do have to put some
70:44 - thought into things like that beforehand
70:46 - so if you want to start a really basic
70:50 - level that's a place to start I don't
70:54 - know in terms of being able to get up
70:57 - started quickly and build like cool
70:59 - useful things quickly and be able to get
71:01 - paid for it
71:02 - I wouldn't start with C message my
71:05 - opinion I don't have that much
71:06 - experience with C so it may be wrong
71:07 - I think HTML CSS JavaScript would be the
71:11 - way to go to be able to start building
71:13 - real things quickly there's a huge
71:18 - market for that so it really depends a
71:21 - lot on what you're trying to do Dimitri
71:27 - says I want to be a cyber sportsman and
71:30 - play CS 1.6 I wanted to be a
71:40 - professional Starcraft player when I was
71:43 - in high school I wanted to move to South
71:45 - Korea and be approached arc a flare
71:48 - didn't happen
71:58 - okay gander seven says I would say start
72:03 - with Java or C sharp they strongly typed
72:06 - similar to a lot of languages and will
72:08 - catch a lot of errors before you run it
72:10 - yeah that so I didn't think of it that
72:13 - way but being strongly typed might be
72:16 - helpful because there's less room for
72:19 - errors when you're using a strongly
72:21 - typed language as opposed to JavaScript
72:24 - which is what do we say loosely type
72:28 - could that be the opposite of strongly
72:30 - typed
72:30 - weakly typed yeah I hadn't thought of
72:36 - that but that's that's another option
72:39 - I'm sorry I feel like we're not giving
72:41 - you a great answer we're just giving you
72:43 - like every language as an answer but
72:46 - really it it really does depend so much
72:49 - on what you're looking to do and what
72:52 - your situation is okay also says what
72:56 - laptop is best Kishore says Mac is good
73:00 - for web dev yeah I do see that a lot of
73:05 - web developers using Mac's especially
73:09 - the MacBook Pro seems to be a very
73:12 - popular one it has enough power to do
73:13 - pretty much whatever you want as a web
73:15 - developer I use a MacBook Pro when I'm
73:19 - not in my office so I would go with a
73:24 - Mac but there are people that run Linux
73:25 - machines people who do Windows it really
73:28 - doesn't matter as long as that
73:29 - particular laptop has you know a good
73:33 - screen if you're gonna be looking at the
73:35 - screen all day you want to have a nice
73:36 - screen and you want to be able to run
73:42 - which you need to run so it needs to
73:43 - have enough power to be able to you know
73:46 - have a bunch of tabs open in Chrome and
73:50 - to be able to have your code editor open
73:52 - and you know running some things locally
73:57 - then you need that so it doesn't need to
74:00 - be really expensive
74:04 - the hell aside Wow I'm just kidding so
74:10 - drowsy maybe I'm not all the way
74:13 - recovered yet
74:14 - my energy has just dropped
74:28 - oh here's a good piece of information so
74:30 - Evo is shared that says when you're
74:35 - doing the sorting stuff always do to
74:39 - uppercase and not to lower case because
74:41 - the care there's a character in German
74:44 - that gets translated when to SS in
74:51 - uppercase so I guess yeah okay yeah so I
75:04 - don't know that much about German so but
75:08 - to uppercase is the better way to go
75:34 - a Pedro asks would you say the market is
75:39 - saturated web developers bringing down
75:41 - the overall wage I I think it there are
75:48 - like levels of the market so there are a
75:52 - lot of web developers at a kind of a low
75:54 - level range that are willing to take
75:56 - work for next to nothing especially on
75:58 - freelance sites but if you kind of get
76:03 - past that and you get up into a level
76:07 - where you're getting into like doing
76:12 - work for bigger companies you know more
76:16 - more expensive work when you get up into
76:19 - that level I don't think it's
76:21 - oversaturated because there's a I
76:26 - suppose like there's a big difference
76:28 - between somebody who can only do minor
76:33 - things and maybe they're doing that work
76:36 - now I'm not saying everybody that's
76:37 - doing the really cheap work is not
76:39 - capable of doing more expensive work
76:42 - because that's certainly not the case
76:43 - there probably a lot of people that are
76:44 - really good that for whatever reason are
76:49 - just at that level right now but if you
76:52 - can break through that and get to some
76:54 - more higher paying clients then you get
76:56 - into a level of being able to do things
76:59 - that maybe the the majority you know
77:02 - can't do and so when you think of like
77:06 - qualified developers I don't think
77:10 - there's a saturation this is just my
77:11 - observation from what I've seen in just
77:16 - around the internet looking at resumes
77:19 - looking at job descriptions and being a
77:21 - freelancer for a few years myself I I
77:25 - think yeah so it's basically super
77:29 - saturated down here at the bottom at the
77:31 - low salary level you know and just
77:35 - bidding on jobs that are paying nothing
77:37 - and then once you get past that then
77:40 - there's there's not as much saturation
77:42 - there's a lot of jobs out there I see
77:44 - really
77:47 - tempting job offers nearly every day
77:50 - that I'm entirely qualified for and I I
77:54 - mean you all see me I'm not like some
77:57 - spectacular rock star developer right
77:59 - I'm just I mean average right like
78:02 - average would be a compliment for me
78:04 - right I'm not you know and there's still
78:09 - so many really good jobs that that I'm
78:14 - qualified more for just with my current
78:16 - skillset of the stuff that we've been
78:17 - doing on on this stream so anyway that's
78:20 - my take on it and that's from being in
78:23 - the United States as well it may be
78:25 - different in different areas of the
78:27 - world but hang in there if you're kind
78:31 - of just trying to make some money at
78:33 - this level I was there for a while and
78:36 - it's tough to break through and get more
78:40 - especially if you're freelance it's
78:41 - really tough to break through and get
78:42 - higher paying clients that really know
78:45 - what quality work is and willing to pay
78:47 - for it so just keep working at it you
78:53 - know try to make as many connections as
78:55 - you can and you know maybe try to get a
78:57 - job with an agency or something so that
78:59 - you can you'll get access to those
79:03 - higher paying clients alright just a few
79:07 - more questions and then I'll have to
79:09 - finish up
79:15 - I would love to know what you all think
79:18 - about market saturation and things that
79:20 - like that that I was just talking about
79:22 - because I only have a really specific
79:24 - perspective from from where I am but you
79:28 - know you all from all over the place so
79:30 - I'm sure you could weigh in and you know
79:32 - what things are like in your area with
79:35 - the type of work that you're doing
79:39 - Sathya says I want to develop my own
79:42 - apps I'm starting to code nowadays
79:44 - though so how should I proceed I wanted
79:47 - to make a social network app from my
79:49 - college project if you have experience
79:52 - with JavaScript and you want to do apps
79:55 - and also especially if you have any
79:57 - experience with react I would use react
79:59 - native to make apps there's no need for
80:03 - you to learn any anything else so that
80:06 - would be the fastest way and you can
80:08 - make good quality apps like that if
80:12 - you're not that familiar with it and you
80:15 - know some Java then go that route with
80:20 - with Android or if you know what is it
80:22 - Swift with iOS or the new stuff is
80:26 - Kotlin if you if you don't know any
80:27 - JavaScript or Android or Swift you try
80:30 - learning Kotlin because that's like the
80:32 - new cool thing that that everybody's
80:35 - doing for Android development so that
80:39 - those would be my suggestions we have
80:41 - done some some app work with react
80:46 - native on the stream
80:48 - not a whole lot we've done some Evo says
80:55 - this is in regard to the question we had
80:58 - earlier about market saturation bringing
81:00 - down wages so Evo says in my opinion if
81:03 - you know how to sell yourself you can
81:04 - get a nice paycheck you just need to
81:06 - make yourself stand out which is easier
81:08 - said than done yeah yeah that mean that
81:13 - that is definitely the case especially
81:16 - when you're trying to break through from
81:18 - that lower level there's a ton of people
81:20 - out there offering you know seemingly
81:22 - all the same stuff and for really cheap
81:26 - so you do have
81:28 - for certain clientele you need to make
81:31 - the case for why you're different or
81:34 - better or worth more some clients will
81:38 - never understand that and you don't know
81:41 - you don't want those clients if you have
81:43 - to take them to pay the bills take them
81:44 - but you really want to get to a level of
81:47 - client that understands that quality
81:50 - takes money so you know be if you can be
81:56 - more specific like more particular about
81:58 - what jobs you take then do and you'll be
82:01 - a lot happier going with clients that
82:03 - understand that but I totally understand
82:06 - if you got to pay the bills I was there
82:07 - and I had to take projects that I didn't
82:10 - want to work on clients that I knew
82:13 - we're gonna be trouble
82:16 - majority my clients were excellent but
82:18 - occasionally you know you do you know
82:21 - you get a bad feeling about a client
82:22 - base so some of the stuff they're saying
82:24 - and you got to make that decision like
82:26 - how bad do I really need this money and
82:29 - sometimes you need the money so you got
82:32 - to take it
83:00 - michael says my plan is to do supercut
83:02 - of every time Jesse yawns and these
83:03 - dreams
83:04 - I mean yawning so much the past couple
83:08 - of weeks I don't know what's wrong with
83:10 - me
83:12 - Chris that says are there less foul
83:14 - permission issues with Ubuntu than Mac
83:16 - OS I don't know personally I haven't
83:20 - used the blue two as an nos like on a
83:23 - laptop or desktop or anything like that
83:25 - I've only used it as a server so not
83:31 - really sure Jolie says I think there's
83:33 - similar or the same they're both UNIX
83:35 - based Anthony says contracting versus
83:39 - permanent I enjoy working permanently
83:44 - right now I did a lot of freelance stuff
83:48 - which it's not exactly a contract thing
83:51 - I guess but it's nice to be able to
83:55 - count on a steady paycheck be little
83:58 - plan ahead you know like here's what I'm
84:02 - gonna be doing a year from now when
84:04 - you're freelance it's just it's not as
84:06 - easy so you do get to work on a variety
84:08 - of projects and meet new people so it
84:12 - can be exciting but you just give up
84:17 - some of that stability so it just kind
84:19 - of depends on where you're at in life
84:21 - and and what you need in terms of you
84:25 - know pay stability and things like that
84:26 - with a family you know for kids and wife
84:30 - stability especially financial stability
84:33 - being able to have health insurance
84:35 - those are really important you know to
84:38 - my wife and I so you know I that's why
84:41 - I'm not freelancing anymore Michael says
84:47 - I'm just I'm just looking for a job I
84:50 - can do while I'm out on disability Oh
84:52 - Michael I know you're out on disability
84:54 - I hope everything gets better for you
84:58 - you know healed up
85:04 - let's see Nina asked what state manager
85:09 - do you use Redux or flux I've used Redux
85:14 - before so if I had to choose I'm like
85:19 - I'm using Redux but if I need to we're
85:22 - not using Redux on this project Evo says
85:27 - in the Netherlands the market situation
85:29 - is not that bad there are loads of job
85:31 - opportunities here heard on the news
85:33 - that they need around 200,000 developers
85:36 - and IT staff Wow nice yeah I mean I I do
85:41 - you always hear that that the job
85:43 - outlook for developers and in really all
85:46 - programming jobs it seems like just
85:48 - keeps on you know increasing it it looks
85:51 - good there's a good outlook so for the
85:54 - foreseeable future it's definitely a a
85:57 - good place to be if you get a job
86:06 - Michael says I know what I can do but I
86:08 - don't know how to sell it yeah I never
86:12 - like the selling part of it sometimes if
86:17 - you can find someone that will partner
86:19 - with you and they can sell and they get
86:21 - a percentage of the money then that's
86:26 - not a bad a bad deal you can just do the
86:29 - code and they can find new clients
86:34 - sometimes like when I would get clients
86:37 - especially if they were in a market that
86:39 - I wanted to get into I would offer deals
86:41 - like I'd say if you bring me in a client
86:43 - and they sign a contract like then
86:45 - you'll get like either money or you'll
86:50 - get free work for me and you know you
86:54 - can kind of incentivize people to try to
86:58 - do networking for you and try to break
87:01 - get clients for you so that can be
87:03 - useful as well
87:13 - okay Joey says and this is talking about
87:16 - apps says progressive web apps are great
87:19 - on Android and create react app
87:20 - practically does all the work definitely
87:22 - true yeah so if you don't need like an
87:25 - app that's going to be on the App Store
87:26 - you just need something that runs well
87:29 - on a phone you can definitely do a
87:30 - progressive web app with create react
87:32 - app that's I mean we haven't really been
87:35 - highlighting it that much but a lot of
87:37 - the stuff that we've built over the last
87:39 - few months have been progressive web
87:40 - apps and they do work well on Android
87:42 - like as a progressive web app
87:52 - Oh ambition so speaking of jobs how did
87:56 - your interview job interview go yeah
87:58 - whoa so yeah I haven't given an update
88:01 - on that sorry so the job interview went
88:04 - well so I'm gonna give you a quick
88:06 - breakdown of what happened so interview
88:08 - went really well I did get offered the
88:10 - job and it wasn't as much as I had hoped
88:18 - for did a little negotiation got it up a
88:21 - bit higher but it wasn't it didn't make
88:27 - sense for me to leave my current
88:28 - position based on a lot of different
88:30 - factors so I tried to quantify as many
88:36 - factors as I could so some meaning like
88:38 - put a dollar value on all the factors
88:41 - and then add that up to try to compare
88:43 - so after I did all that that's when I
88:46 - realized you know hey this this offer is
88:49 - not quite good enough for me to justify
88:51 - leaving where I'm at right now so that's
88:55 - where it's at I really the company was a
88:57 - great company it would have been a lot
88:59 - of fun to work there it seems like yeah
89:02 - but it just wasn't it wasn't quite
89:04 - enough for me to want to leave so that's
89:08 - how it went it was a great process I'm
89:10 - glad I went through it it was really
89:12 - nice meeting you know developers from a
89:15 - different company and I really enjoyed
89:19 - the interview process even the
89:21 - whiteboard problem was fun it was it was
89:25 - cool it's a nice feeling when somebody
89:27 - like recognizes your abilities and wants
89:30 - you to you know to work with them so
89:33 - yeah so it was a good process I yeah I
89:39 - I'm glad yeah I'm letting it happen
89:42 - but I'll be staying here which is good
89:45 - news for the stream because nothing will
89:47 - change with the stream we'll still be
89:49 - able to do it during you know during the
89:51 - day so I'm happy about that and that was
89:55 - one of the things that I did factor in
89:57 - is the ability to be able to keep doing
89:59 - the stream you know that was important
90:01 - to me that's one of those things that's
90:02 - really really hard to put a dollar value
90:04 - on
90:06 - nobody that was definitely a factor
90:18 - okay Anthony says thanks Jessie I have a
90:20 - little one too here in the UK
90:21 - contracting seems to pay really well
90:23 - compared okay cool
90:26 - yeah that's that's good to know
90:30 - it is cool to know like in different
90:32 - parts of the world what the because
90:34 - every market is kind of different you
90:36 - know
90:48 - Joey says have you seen the new react
90:50 - context API it looks like it could
90:52 - replace Redux in most cases I haven't
90:55 - seen that much on it other than some
90:57 - tweets about it I haven't I just haven't
91:00 - taken the time to really look into it
91:02 - more so I'm I'm definitely interested
91:08 - you know especially I don't want to keep
91:11 - thinking in terms of redux for you know
91:13 - upcoming projects if it's going to be
91:17 - unnecessary so I definitely want to
91:18 - check that out more and maybe after I
91:21 - learn more about it we can you know talk
91:23 - about it more on the stream and maybe
91:26 - maybe start using it demo some of it at
91:30 - some point not not right now not on this
91:33 - project most likely signee says is there
91:40 - a playlist of your various streams and
91:42 - basic installation required to start and
91:43 - follow your course okay so on so I have
91:48 - my own YouTube channel so this is the
91:51 - free code camp channel but if you check
91:52 - in the description there should be a
91:53 - link to my channel I have a video I
91:56 - think it's the the latest video on that
91:59 - channel has like a purple background and
92:02 - it's it's something like git and it's
92:05 - talking about like using it and github
92:07 - and and cloning things from get up check
92:10 - out that video that will give you a good
92:12 - introduction it starts out really basics
92:15 - you might might not need to watch it all
92:16 - but I'll give you a good introduction on
92:18 - how to get things started for most of
92:21 - these projects also if you look at the
92:24 - project repositories on github
92:26 - we usually have instructions in the
92:28 - readme for how to start everything and
92:30 - then we have a contributing MD file that
92:33 - gives you instructions on how to
92:35 - contribute so I'd start with that and
92:38 - I'm hoping to do some more videos to
92:41 - kind of go more in depth on how to start
92:44 - these projects and help with them so
92:46 - hopefully I can get those videos made
92:48 - soon and if you need any more help let
92:51 - me know if it's for a particular project
92:53 - you know you could just open up an issue
92:56 - in that particular repository or let me
92:59 - know however on social media on the
93:02 - stream whatever is best for you and and
93:05 - then I can give you more specific help
93:07 - you know based on what you're trying to
93:08 - do let's see
93:16 - Lorena says what does they recommend mid
93:18 - level of education or path to follow it
93:22 - really really depends on what you want
93:25 - to do since I'm in web development I'll
93:28 - give you kind of what what I would do to
93:30 - be a web developer and it depends on
93:34 - what you know so I'm going to assume
93:35 - like totally beginner level if if you
93:38 - already know that then you can just kind
93:40 - of skip some of these steps but totally
93:42 - beginner level I would start out with
93:43 - some basic stuff so free code camp dot
93:45 - org has like challenges that'll sort you
93:47 - out at a really low level you could work
93:49 - your way up as you're doing free code
93:51 - camp if you find another tutorial
93:53 - somewhere that you can learn more about
93:55 - a particular thing like no problem you
93:58 - can branch out and follow that and then
93:59 - come back that's how I did it if you if
94:05 - you don't particularly like that style
94:07 - of learning there are other styles so
94:10 - Udacity courses is more video based so I
94:14 - think it's udacity.com
94:15 - they of courses some are paid courses
94:18 - some are free courses they have a lot of
94:20 - free courses that are helpful for web
94:22 - development they're more video based so
94:26 - if you're into more video learning you
94:27 - can do that or watch YouTube videos of
94:31 - on free code camp if you like to just
94:35 - read like a book check out the book
94:37 - called you don't know Jas it's available
94:39 - for free to read on your computer on
94:42 - github so you can buy the actual book if
94:45 - you want or you can read it for free
94:46 - online but that would be a nice
94:48 - introduction to JavaScript just being
94:51 - able to read it all out so if you want
94:54 - to be a web developer though you know
94:55 - HTML CSS and then JavaScript or luego
94:59 - and usually in that order because HTML
95:02 - be the easiest CSS shouldn't be your
95:05 - that difficult to learn enough to do
95:07 - some cool stuff with and then Java
95:08 - scripts going to be the thing
95:09 - that you just keep on learning and
95:11 - learning and you kind of you never get
95:13 - finished learning it but it will allow
95:15 - you to do the most stuff and to get jobs
95:17 - that can make you the most money and you
95:18 - can do kind of the you can make more
95:23 - powerful things and cooler things with
95:25 - it so that's kind of I know that kind of
95:31 - a big overview hopefully that helps
95:33 - somewhat it's let me check the time all
95:43 - right I think I can finish this up Joey
95:48 - says the new context API seems pretty
95:50 - simple it can be understood in a matter
95:53 - of minutes it's just an alpha though so
95:55 - not ready for production yet okay yeah I
95:58 - I didn't think it was quite ready yet so
96:01 - yeah so maybe a while before we demo it
96:04 - but I'm really glad to know that it's
96:07 - it's simple Anthony asks what I used to
96:11 - stream with OBS so OBS is free software
96:17 - to help you stream so I just have that
96:19 - set up and then you know of course also
96:21 - YouTube alright I've gotten to the
96:27 - bottom hopefully I didn't miss anyone's
96:29 - questions I did skip over a few
96:32 - statements in there and that was just
96:34 - for time to apologize if I didn't read
96:37 - everything out all right cool
96:42 - so I have less than 10 minutes now thank
96:47 - you all for watching and for being so
96:49 - helpful when we were trying to go
96:50 - through this problem this seems like
96:52 - it's taking such a long time so thanks
96:54 - for your patience but I think we're
96:55 - really really close to having everything
96:57 - working with the sorting the way we want
97:00 - let me think anything else I only have
97:05 - anything else right now I will try to
97:07 - stream tomorrow around my normal time so
97:10 - around 12 noon if I can I'll let you
97:15 - know via Twitter if you want to follow
97:18 - me on Twitter also Instagram so you can
97:20 - check that out if you interested in any
97:23 - my videos you know check out my YouTube
97:25 - channel links in the description and
97:27 - yeah that's it for me so until tomorrow
97:31 - have a wonderful day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and I haven't streamed in a while so yesterday or not yesterday last week almost everyone in my family was sick so I took Wednesday Thursday and Friday off so first I was taking care of sick people and then I was sick and so I'm not a hundred percent yet but I'm almost almost there so sorry about not streaming today we're gonna just pick up where we left off on Tuesday yeah Tuesday was the last stream so for me I'm just I'm just picking this up so I haven't really done much I hope to be able to get some work done from home but I didn't really get that much done I was just exhausted so hey everyone see you on the live chat there I'm gonna get started by starting up the end Rock server and I'm gonna paste the link to that in the live chat so oh I'll try to remember to paste it again in a few minutes for the people that maybe are coming in later that I don't know if you can if you come in late can you still see everything in the live chat or do you just see like the last few things that happen I don't know let me know I'll probably still post it again no matter what just to be sure I do want to ask you a question so I had you know someone who watches the the live chat has been asking some questions on Twitter and I keep forgetting to ask you all because I'm not sure what the answer is but they're creating a like a online shopping cart so this is like an ecommerce site and they're using react so they're having trouble with their you know with getting things to show up in the cart so I'm not I haven't seen the code so I don't know everything that's going on but if anyone has done any ecommerce stuff with react and you have any suggestions or you know any maybe like packages or something that would help with that please let me know in the live chat or you know through some other means comments or on Twitter or something and I will forward that information alone because I've never done ecommerce with with react before so I'm not really I don't really have the experience to be able to give good advice in that area but I would still like to help if possible okay where we left off last week and we were we created a switch statement and we were using sort so we were mapping through our data and then we were using dot sort to sort everything in different ways so we didn't quite get that working so there's a problem with somehow how I set up the the sort the sorting functions so I've started to look at the documentation because we copy and pasted from previous project where the sorting works I think the problem is the data that I'm getting in now is different from the data I was getting in in the other application so that's where we're gonna start and trying to get this to work and this is not going to be a really long stream so I did I got a question about how long will the stream be normally the streams end up being between like one and two hours I'm gonna save like an hour and a half is about average today I can only I could probably stream for an hour and a half today and and it would be ok but I can't go longer than an hour and a half because I have something at 1245 so there's actually in office st. Patrick's Day parties the st. Patrick's Day was on Saturday obviously no one was working on Saturday so the party is today which is why I'm wearing green it doesn't look green on the camera though but this is a green sweater but anyway I want to go to that party and I think there's going to be really good food there which I'm excited about so that's why the stream is not going to be too long so I better stop talking and get to coding let me switch my screen here okay so here you can see I was looking at the documentation here and I noticed that when we're comparing numbers this actually works and that's really what we're doing let me start my time with as well and I'm gonna paste that and grogg link one more time for those who are just joining us I think we had about maybe 20 people join since the last time I posted it so there's the link you'll be able to see the site with that link so you can see that's what we're doing here we're just you know taking a and B all right the values of a and B and we're doing a minus B so the difference being we're not we don't have numbers and this is what I I wanted to see these are numbers so they should work where they should daily should be numbers so I want to double check and make sure like are we actually getting numbers what like what are we getting you know before I start changing these around you know how we're doing this I want to be sure of what Dana that we have and I see there are some questions in the live chat I'll answer all the questions when I take a little break so after about another 25 minutes I'm going to take a little break and I'm going to answer all the questions so please be patient with me and I'll try to get to all your questions before I before I finish today okay so let me first let's go to the the output that we're getting from the WordPress API hmm and my stream is getting some weirdness let me plug in I forgot to plug in my ethernet cord where do that alright I found it you have a like I can't see the back of my Mac right now so I'm just trying to feel around there we go alright hopefully that will keep the stream a little bit more stable it shouldn't cut out while switching yeah it's not cutting out okay cool and all right so so far it looks a little bit more stable at least on my end it wasn't my work wasn't getting any warnings about stream quality from YouTube but from OBS it was showing me red and meaning that my my internet speed was not not good enough okay all right so let's let's check out the data and I did have hmm I wonder if I still have it over here no yeah here we go oops wrong one there we go okay so here's our date here's what we get from date okay and it is a string so I'm gonna copy that and let's go over let's go over here let's do dates parse and then we'll put that string in and let's see what we get okay so we do actually get a number let's see well this work I can't ever remember with the sin taxes for this let's see no shoot I mean this this does look like a number so I think we're safe with that okay so I think we are getting numbers oh okay I get so Anthony's saying just use type of want to go three oh okay did I use the wrong whoops oh my god no capital okay no Calvin or thank you all right cool it is a number so just wanted to check all right so we have numbers so these dates should work and I say okay so let's see what's happening with this function so when you sort by we're passing in the type which is the type when does this get called alright here we go so we're we're manually passing in the type date oldest okay now we're manually passing in that site so it should this should work let's see make sure I'm not doing anything in here that would mess it up all right we might be getting more than a hundred posts let's see what we were searching by make sure we're not getting more than a hundred pose let's all right so we're only getting fifty three posts all right I remember going through this the less I mean through this process okay and we're logging out here's our dates three five twenty so this is showing the newest first which is not what we want let's change this and see if maybe we haven't reversed made newest hey Harsha how's it going I'm glad this time worked for you biology will work ok not it's the same order who hmm okay hey everyone I see ladies in high enough shoot all right what's going on what am I doing wrong you look back it was my original sedate oldest I date oldest forgiveness it was my time soon okay let me I wonder if these are even running let's see let's let's see what can I do with this can I put something else in here oops okay okay so that is should be running date analyst whoa okay it ran a lot of times because we're mapping over it I take newest so it is getting the type sort of data exists a data that's a log sort data so does sorted data actually just Francois chief I use so what is data sir okay so I wasn't trying to save anything to a variable here I was just sort and then I was mapping I don't know why I said we were mapping and sorting we're not mapping and sorting so I apologize for saying that earlier let's see okay so we need let me see what sort does we have a variable here that stores the elements of an array in place and returns the array this source not necessarily saying all the default orders at Clooney's she could finish okay we did check this before so if we have an existing array and we run sort on it it will change that array okay that's we needed to know all right so let's go whoa hey maybe this is the problem maybe that should not have been Const let's try that out I hope that is really the the answer to this okay all right so new lists I don't really know since that's new list first I guess we could check all right let's change this to oldest do the work no what's it boy hold on a second okay so it's working briefly haha I don't know if you'll see this you could probably try it out on your machines now if you have the N grout link okay so when I hit enter it briefly sorts everything correctly and then it goes back to the normal way so why is it doing that all right let's see what we're doing so this whereby the oldest okay great let's see what we're logging here alright so this is sort of the right way this is sorted the right way since 1750 yeah this one's sorted the right way all right so we're getting and the spots where we're console logging we're getting the data in the right order let's see where all right so we have a console log here so at this point that's this weird whoa oh forget my plus sign there we go that was a lot of red all of a sudden now I should've known that what happened alright there may be a better way to do that but this will work okay so why so we can see our dates here and we're getting I should move this up so y'all can see everything so we're getting the dates initially in order from the oldest to the newest it looks like yeah and then afterwards it's still in that same order but what's displayed here is not in that order all right let me get a little the live chat and see what you all think okay yeah okay I see so harsh it's saying use moment Jess I'm not really doing anything with the dates I just need I just want eat numbers so I just need to turn the date into a number and and I'm doing that the problem I have now is I need to sort them properly all right so Joey sing the sorting will will actually modify the array that's act that's what I want right now so that's that's the behavior that I want I want the array to be modified see it's okay let's alright so the problem now I think our sorting is actually working so things things are sorting differently depending on the values we pass in so just to doublecheck that let's pass in what are we using right now oldest let's go back to newest just to see that there's definitely a difference in the order the newest yep there's a difference even this is wild why are we getting the difference all right why are we getting the difference though even here and in the same data so our console law bits here should not be reordering right so at this point we haven't even called this sorting function this dangerous actually let's do this all right we are getting some change recession we have the exact same date for some of these hey see you later oh [ __ ] all right I'm gonna switch back to oldest because we were seeing definitely a different change okay so we're still getting that switch I was afraid we had something going on you know with what this may be running before it was supposed to but it doesn't look like that was doing anything let's see see michael says type isn't getting logged yeah our type is getting log here so when we're running these console logs here it is actually see date oldest is running all right let me take a break because the timer ran out and I'm gonna answer some questions now and then we'll come back to it and I think we can get in one more Pomodoro session okay so I'm gonna scroll up Anthony asked if I was using WordPress as the backend I am so we are getting data from WordPress I mean I I don't know if I would call it the complete backend there's more going on but WordPress is our content management system so we're using it just for that we're not using any of the display portion of word for us mmm D she hub says how many time completed this course I'm not sure what you I'm not sure what you mean let me know maybe if you could clarify yeah so I'm just not exactly sure we're here what you're asking Thao asks if building what am i what am i building University website yep so building a new website for Franciscan University Michael said early start again yeah early start I have stuff going on in the afternoon so how to get it in early Kishor says how to set how to do this setup in windows / linux the git repo and everything yeah you can it should run Linux for sure it should run Windows I think it runs on Windows does anybody run this on their machine on Windows I think it works but I haven't personally tried it yeah but all you would need to do is just clone clone the repo and to your local machine and then do NPM install or yarn if you use yarn and then after all the packages are installed then just do NPM run dev yeah I think it's def there are instructions on this repo as well so if you go to the repository links in the description if you go there and just view the readme it will have instructions for how to get this up and running all right Bhargav says what are you doing which language it's it's JavaScript and we're using react which is a JavaScript library and in particular we're trying to sort some numbers so also a switch app in which I'm Mac so I'm on I I don't know my iMac is 20 I'll just show you I'll show you the stats for the spec so I guess it's really small so it's uh retina 5k 27inch late 2014 I got the intel core i7 and 32 gigabytes of ram and i'm using Visual Studio code Dimitri asks how old am I I am 32 years old all right cool Joey confirms that it does work on Windows excellent Thank You Joey okay all right and get through the questions just in time so let me go we'll start another Pomodoro session a few seconds early and let's let's check quickly let me bring this down a bit and let's get out of node I'd like to run through this briefly just to get an idea of the logic of what's happening okay so all right so initially our our data in state is it's totally empty which is what we want so when when we initiate the search so this is called get search results and pinnacles debounce search so it sets the the value in state so we have that we call debounce search which then calls fetch search term and now word fetch search term so now it just builds the the search query and now we're calling get JSON which we've imported from another file which simply just uses the fetch API so now we're passing it that string that we've just created and then we're getting the data and we're setting that data into into state so now data has all of the posts that have been returned from the WordPress API then we're console logging what that data is then we're calling sort by and in this case we're sorting by date oldest so now let's go down to sort by so actually so let's so we've had at this point we've had one change in state so let's see what would happen then so you've had a change in state so we're gonna get a rerender and now down here data dot length will be greater than zero since we had data so then we're gonna map over it so we're mapping over everything great hmm we could move the sorting logic down here I really don't want to but that's how I did it in a previous project and I know it worked there who wouldn't actually be manipulating the data that's in state instead we would just be changing it about in terms of how we display it let's let's let's move it down to here that'll simplify things we'll be able to get rid of some of the stuff that we're doing right now and it'll be a good candidate for a refactor at some point but we can get rid of a lot of this so we'll just comment some some of this out for now so that we can easily you refactor back to something like this later so let's grab just this part this sort and we're gonna copy that and then for all of this goodness for all of this we're just gonna comment that out now we can do let's do our sorting before we map obviously and so now we're gonna get the data we're gonna sort the data and let's know what all right so instead of tight how do we do this you go back here okay we have the sorting saved in a Redux tour but let's save the sorting in State this time if you do this oh yeah let's get rid of these console us it's wondering why I had typed so many times in there okay great now we'll say this state sort by and I think we already have this in in state so we'll just set it manually and then so after this happens then it will then map over everything okay let's give this a try we do need to set sort by and we'll go dates oldest okay refresh let's try that out so we can see right now the newest is shilling showing first now let's hit enter you gotta be kidding me I'm getting the phone call so let's say you did hello hey how's it going sure mmhmm yes hmm okay yeah you probably maybe we can conditionally have that load so when it load on the editing pages yeah okay all right let me see yeah let me see what what form are you working on right now anything in particular okay yeah yeah just make yeah make sure that that I have access and I can see it and I'll check it out and then I'll try the like the conditional loading of the styles and make sure it works but if it works then I'll apply it to all the other forms that we're using their styles for all right yeah no problem okay all right so that was one of my colleagues in the IT department it seems that a project that we worked on earlier which was adding styles system Salesforce forms gentleman think those particular forms that he was talking about I don't think I live stream that I did live stream some other forms we were working on but the problem is when you go to load the editor page for those forms the Styles are being applied and they're messing up the interface so they look fine to the normal user when they go to fill out the form but when someone an ite or somewhere else on campus tries to go to the admin panel and edit doesn't look good so I'm thinking like you probably heard what if I just add something to where you know if if there's a certain string that we can find in the URL that make the notes that this is an editing page then maybe we don't load the Styles something like that let's see yeah let's keep working on this for now because it's probably going to take them a few minutes to get the form give me access to the form that they're working on to the test form so I thought about maybe like just switching over knowing that right now but I don't think I don't think that'll work out okay so in it for now let's see a Jew okay I was trying to check to make sure that these different types weren't all getting grouped together and they're not so we can see there's your 26 that's interesting so this is definitely out of order all right so we have something for 2018 down below 2017 here and then 2018 yes so the order is not even really working the sorting is not working at all let me make sure I did save that and we'll do a refresh actually ask you sir did it work this time by 2017 15 15 18 18 18 18 18 2018 one six yeah I think it worked nice okay cool so that works let's switch this to make sure it works now the aides newest all right now it's switched over here great and now we should be able to go in here can we change state in here and have it give us a rear ender I think we can sort by let's switch it up yeah hey sorted to newest mom back to oldest whoops there we go oldest cool alright that works so now on a state change we have a change here awesome okay cool let me check my time I still good on time now the next thing that we had was this alphabetical order and I don't think that this will work as we're doing it here but let's I don't know let's just give it a shot it'll only take a second and if it works it'll save a lot of time yeah that does not look like alphabetical order yeah and definitely not okay so that's not working so this setup here does work what we need to do though is get the the alphabetical order working so we'll just need to change what's here and what's here and then we'll be all set with with the logic of it the next step then would be to tie it in to the UI so to make some sort of a dropdown radio button something like that and have that set the state for sort by and then everything else will work this I really don't like having all this right here in the component but it it does make things it uses less code than our other solution really yeah so I don't know maybe I'll leave it like this let me know y'all think we'll see we'll see how much gets added to when we try to do alphabetical order okay well let's go back to our documentation and let's see so by default we do have alphabetical order when using sort hmm buffoon idiot the array all right this is where we could probably put in here greater than or less than right let's try that out wait a second nice we have a string right here console disorder any sort and that's sort of a it looks like this sorted this string in alphabetical order but it used this which is what we're currently using so this was string array dot sort right or no did it not use compare numbers there it didn't it just you sort okay all right sorry I misread that okay so then yeah let's let's try the greater than less then see what we get right let me I'm gonna check the live chat just for a second okay Evo says hey those are going and ego says couldn't you extract the date parsing code into separate function which removes a few lines of the current component yeah you know what I've been thinking about that I think that's a good idea I'm just not I haven't really thought about how I'd do it but you know if we're repeating ourselves four times here there's got to be a better way to do it so yeah I mean right now it's it's not a huge deal right it's only four times it doesn't take up that much space but I'd still rather be able to do it I'm afraid like the solution to this would end up taking up more lines than what we have now really but it does make me want to you know pull this out and have a different function all right so I'm gonna try to just add in a greater than sign and see what happens let's give it a refresh and see did I change this up here officer let's change it whoops let's change it up here okay so right off the bat we'll have that and okay it doesn't look like this is doing anything let me make sure I'm title rendered okay damn one by title let's see what kind of change we have let's just do it this way so we have these a and B reversed so that's why I'm just going with greater than both times and let's see what I want to do is sort it this way and then change state over here and let's go alright so something happened it's not quite right it's haha so a change is happening but it's not quite alphabetical okay Joey says in the sort docs there's an example sort by name that may be relevant okay cool let's check it out oops my timer is up so maybe we'll have to check that out ah maybe we should do something like this then okay that'll probably be the next thing that that I'll try what's this Eva says playing game that was advocate maybe but you could use lodash to do this for you okay all right what what in lodash then would help is there like a sorting thing in low that would help us out with this I kind of think we're pretty close I wish that if I was gonna use low I wish I would have known about it last week uhhuh but add a to lower case maybe yeah I guess we could I could do to lower case I'm trying to think if the titles yeah you know what I'm not I'm sure that the titles are all the same case okay well I have to yeah I've got to answer questions now in the live chat and this so if if you're kind of wondering how we're gonna solve this I made you stream it tomorrow but if I don't and let's say I fix it before then this is probably what I'm gonna use something like this and this may be a good candidate to just use a separate function for since we really just care about returning you know like one or negative one okay all right so let me go back let's um let's commit this and then push it up to github that way you all will have all this code to check out as well that is good good add we're gonna get added we just gonna add everything just with a period there and then we'll do our yarn cm this is kind of a little custom thing we have set up to help you know walk someone through doing a nice commit message so let's say that is a new feature and this is gonna be a date logic to search no I don't think so all right let's see if we passed the test looks pretty good so far I think this is gonna work yay and now all right all this code is now on github and I will scroll up a bit and try to answer all the questions okay kiss sure says NPM is not working with with get for Windows I'm not sure I mean I it's really hard for me to tell what the problem is you know without being able to see what's going on you think I don't think we need a specific version of node for this project I'm not sure I mean I'd say you know make sure node is uptodate and an NPM they're up to date you can use yarn if you want and it's all yarn and use that that's what we're using let's see but I'm not sure I pronounce the name is being har gh8 V so sorry I don't know how to pronounce that let me know the correct way to pronounce it and I will do my best to say it correctly but anyway they asked from where I learned coding so you can learn coding from free code camp so free code camp dot work has a lot of challenges to walk you through learning frontend programming first and then you do all the way through back end and so it's it's somewhat comprehensive it's going to be a lot of JavaScript so if you're interested in JavaScript that would be good otherwise there are some other programs like Udacity has some good courses on a variety of different things so everything from you know web development to selfdriving cars they have a lot of stuff and for that kind of a beginner level code Academy has a lot of good beginner tutorials so I'd say those three places are a good place to start oh they also asked which programming language is best for me I'm a complete beginner yeah I I mean I started out with JavaScript mostly I think it was a good language to start with because you don't need really anything special to start out with it the browser you can just start doing stuff in the console on your browser but you know there's a good argument to be made that other programming languages are easy so kishore says like for a beginner Python and C is a startup I thought is nice because there's a lot less in terms of syntax to have to remember at first so that would be a good place to start it does kind of depend on what you want to do apology say I was trying to hold back this yawn for a while now and I couldn't do it any longer yeah so I would say of of the three so Kishore mentions HTML CSS and JavaScript if you want to be a web developer so for sure if you want to do web stuff for sure start with that you're going to be using you know JavaScript most of the time as a web developer so especially if you're doing more frontend stuff but otherwise if you don't want to do ever you're not sure what you want to do then I I would say Python Kishore also mentioned C C's a good place to get like some really basic stuff and to understand like a lot of concepts that you don't even have to think about when you do JavaScript and C like like the type of variable that you're setting Java you never have to really like think beforehand all right what type is this going to be right you don't have to say like is this gonna be a 32bit integer or something like that right but in other some other languages and C is like this you really do have to put some thought into things like that beforehand so if you want to start a really basic level that's a place to start I don't know in terms of being able to get up started quickly and build like cool useful things quickly and be able to get paid for it I wouldn't start with C message my opinion I don't have that much experience with C so it may be wrong I think HTML CSS JavaScript would be the way to go to be able to start building real things quickly there's a huge market for that so it really depends a lot on what you're trying to do Dimitri says I want to be a cyber sportsman and play CS 1.6 I wanted to be a professional Starcraft player when I was in high school I wanted to move to South Korea and be approached arc a flare didn't happen okay gander seven says I would say start with Java or C sharp they strongly typed similar to a lot of languages and will catch a lot of errors before you run it yeah that so I didn't think of it that way but being strongly typed might be helpful because there's less room for errors when you're using a strongly typed language as opposed to JavaScript which is what do we say loosely type could that be the opposite of strongly typed weakly typed yeah I hadn't thought of that but that's that's another option I'm sorry I feel like we're not giving you a great answer we're just giving you like every language as an answer but really it it really does depend so much on what you're looking to do and what your situation is okay also says what laptop is best Kishore says Mac is good for web dev yeah I do see that a lot of web developers using Mac's especially the MacBook Pro seems to be a very popular one it has enough power to do pretty much whatever you want as a web developer I use a MacBook Pro when I'm not in my office so I would go with a Mac but there are people that run Linux machines people who do Windows it really doesn't matter as long as that particular laptop has you know a good screen if you're gonna be looking at the screen all day you want to have a nice screen and you want to be able to run which you need to run so it needs to have enough power to be able to you know have a bunch of tabs open in Chrome and to be able to have your code editor open and you know running some things locally then you need that so it doesn't need to be really expensive the hell aside Wow I'm just kidding so drowsy maybe I'm not all the way recovered yet my energy has just dropped oh here's a good piece of information so Evo is shared that says when you're doing the sorting stuff always do to uppercase and not to lower case because the care there's a character in German that gets translated when to SS in uppercase so I guess yeah okay yeah so I don't know that much about German so but to uppercase is the better way to go a Pedro asks would you say the market is saturated web developers bringing down the overall wage I I think it there are like levels of the market so there are a lot of web developers at a kind of a low level range that are willing to take work for next to nothing especially on freelance sites but if you kind of get past that and you get up into a level where you're getting into like doing work for bigger companies you know more more expensive work when you get up into that level I don't think it's oversaturated because there's a I suppose like there's a big difference between somebody who can only do minor things and maybe they're doing that work now I'm not saying everybody that's doing the really cheap work is not capable of doing more expensive work because that's certainly not the case there probably a lot of people that are really good that for whatever reason are just at that level right now but if you can break through that and get to some more higher paying clients then you get into a level of being able to do things that maybe the the majority you know can't do and so when you think of like qualified developers I don't think there's a saturation this is just my observation from what I've seen in just around the internet looking at resumes looking at job descriptions and being a freelancer for a few years myself I I think yeah so it's basically super saturated down here at the bottom at the low salary level you know and just bidding on jobs that are paying nothing and then once you get past that then there's there's not as much saturation there's a lot of jobs out there I see really tempting job offers nearly every day that I'm entirely qualified for and I I mean you all see me I'm not like some spectacular rock star developer right I'm just I mean average right like average would be a compliment for me right I'm not you know and there's still so many really good jobs that that I'm qualified more for just with my current skillset of the stuff that we've been doing on on this stream so anyway that's my take on it and that's from being in the United States as well it may be different in different areas of the world but hang in there if you're kind of just trying to make some money at this level I was there for a while and it's tough to break through and get more especially if you're freelance it's really tough to break through and get higher paying clients that really know what quality work is and willing to pay for it so just keep working at it you know try to make as many connections as you can and you know maybe try to get a job with an agency or something so that you can you'll get access to those higher paying clients alright just a few more questions and then I'll have to finish up I would love to know what you all think about market saturation and things that like that that I was just talking about because I only have a really specific perspective from from where I am but you know you all from all over the place so I'm sure you could weigh in and you know what things are like in your area with the type of work that you're doing Sathya says I want to develop my own apps I'm starting to code nowadays though so how should I proceed I wanted to make a social network app from my college project if you have experience with JavaScript and you want to do apps and also especially if you have any experience with react I would use react native to make apps there's no need for you to learn any anything else so that would be the fastest way and you can make good quality apps like that if you're not that familiar with it and you know some Java then go that route with with Android or if you know what is it Swift with iOS or the new stuff is Kotlin if you if you don't know any JavaScript or Android or Swift you try learning Kotlin because that's like the new cool thing that that everybody's doing for Android development so that those would be my suggestions we have done some some app work with react native on the stream not a whole lot we've done some Evo says this is in regard to the question we had earlier about market saturation bringing down wages so Evo says in my opinion if you know how to sell yourself you can get a nice paycheck you just need to make yourself stand out which is easier said than done yeah yeah that mean that that is definitely the case especially when you're trying to break through from that lower level there's a ton of people out there offering you know seemingly all the same stuff and for really cheap so you do have for certain clientele you need to make the case for why you're different or better or worth more some clients will never understand that and you don't know you don't want those clients if you have to take them to pay the bills take them but you really want to get to a level of client that understands that quality takes money so you know be if you can be more specific like more particular about what jobs you take then do and you'll be a lot happier going with clients that understand that but I totally understand if you got to pay the bills I was there and I had to take projects that I didn't want to work on clients that I knew we're gonna be trouble majority my clients were excellent but occasionally you know you do you know you get a bad feeling about a client base so some of the stuff they're saying and you got to make that decision like how bad do I really need this money and sometimes you need the money so you got to take it michael says my plan is to do supercut of every time Jesse yawns and these dreams I mean yawning so much the past couple of weeks I don't know what's wrong with me Chris that says are there less foul permission issues with Ubuntu than Mac OS I don't know personally I haven't used the blue two as an nos like on a laptop or desktop or anything like that I've only used it as a server so not really sure Jolie says I think there's similar or the same they're both UNIX based Anthony says contracting versus permanent I enjoy working permanently right now I did a lot of freelance stuff which it's not exactly a contract thing I guess but it's nice to be able to count on a steady paycheck be little plan ahead you know like here's what I'm gonna be doing a year from now when you're freelance it's just it's not as easy so you do get to work on a variety of projects and meet new people so it can be exciting but you just give up some of that stability so it just kind of depends on where you're at in life and and what you need in terms of you know pay stability and things like that with a family you know for kids and wife stability especially financial stability being able to have health insurance those are really important you know to my wife and I so you know I that's why I'm not freelancing anymore Michael says I'm just I'm just looking for a job I can do while I'm out on disability Oh Michael I know you're out on disability I hope everything gets better for you you know healed up let's see Nina asked what state manager do you use Redux or flux I've used Redux before so if I had to choose I'm like I'm using Redux but if I need to we're not using Redux on this project Evo says in the Netherlands the market situation is not that bad there are loads of job opportunities here heard on the news that they need around 200,000 developers and IT staff Wow nice yeah I mean I I do you always hear that that the job outlook for developers and in really all programming jobs it seems like just keeps on you know increasing it it looks good there's a good outlook so for the foreseeable future it's definitely a a good place to be if you get a job Michael says I know what I can do but I don't know how to sell it yeah I never like the selling part of it sometimes if you can find someone that will partner with you and they can sell and they get a percentage of the money then that's not a bad a bad deal you can just do the code and they can find new clients sometimes like when I would get clients especially if they were in a market that I wanted to get into I would offer deals like I'd say if you bring me in a client and they sign a contract like then you'll get like either money or you'll get free work for me and you know you can kind of incentivize people to try to do networking for you and try to break get clients for you so that can be useful as well okay Joey says and this is talking about apps says progressive web apps are great on Android and create react app practically does all the work definitely true yeah so if you don't need like an app that's going to be on the App Store you just need something that runs well on a phone you can definitely do a progressive web app with create react app that's I mean we haven't really been highlighting it that much but a lot of the stuff that we've built over the last few months have been progressive web apps and they do work well on Android like as a progressive web app Oh ambition so speaking of jobs how did your interview job interview go yeah whoa so yeah I haven't given an update on that sorry so the job interview went well so I'm gonna give you a quick breakdown of what happened so interview went really well I did get offered the job and it wasn't as much as I had hoped for did a little negotiation got it up a bit higher but it wasn't it didn't make sense for me to leave my current position based on a lot of different factors so I tried to quantify as many factors as I could so some meaning like put a dollar value on all the factors and then add that up to try to compare so after I did all that that's when I realized you know hey this this offer is not quite good enough for me to justify leaving where I'm at right now so that's where it's at I really the company was a great company it would have been a lot of fun to work there it seems like yeah but it just wasn't it wasn't quite enough for me to want to leave so that's how it went it was a great process I'm glad I went through it it was really nice meeting you know developers from a different company and I really enjoyed the interview process even the whiteboard problem was fun it was it was cool it's a nice feeling when somebody like recognizes your abilities and wants you to you know to work with them so yeah so it was a good process I yeah I I'm glad yeah I'm letting it happen but I'll be staying here which is good news for the stream because nothing will change with the stream we'll still be able to do it during you know during the day so I'm happy about that and that was one of the things that I did factor in is the ability to be able to keep doing the stream you know that was important to me that's one of those things that's really really hard to put a dollar value on nobody that was definitely a factor okay Anthony says thanks Jessie I have a little one too here in the UK contracting seems to pay really well compared okay cool yeah that's that's good to know it is cool to know like in different parts of the world what the because every market is kind of different you know Joey says have you seen the new react context API it looks like it could replace Redux in most cases I haven't seen that much on it other than some tweets about it I haven't I just haven't taken the time to really look into it more so I'm I'm definitely interested you know especially I don't want to keep thinking in terms of redux for you know upcoming projects if it's going to be unnecessary so I definitely want to check that out more and maybe after I learn more about it we can you know talk about it more on the stream and maybe maybe start using it demo some of it at some point not not right now not on this project most likely signee says is there a playlist of your various streams and basic installation required to start and follow your course okay so on so I have my own YouTube channel so this is the free code camp channel but if you check in the description there should be a link to my channel I have a video I think it's the the latest video on that channel has like a purple background and it's it's something like git and it's talking about like using it and github and and cloning things from get up check out that video that will give you a good introduction it starts out really basics you might might not need to watch it all but I'll give you a good introduction on how to get things started for most of these projects also if you look at the project repositories on github we usually have instructions in the readme for how to start everything and then we have a contributing MD file that gives you instructions on how to contribute so I'd start with that and I'm hoping to do some more videos to kind of go more in depth on how to start these projects and help with them so hopefully I can get those videos made soon and if you need any more help let me know if it's for a particular project you know you could just open up an issue in that particular repository or let me know however on social media on the stream whatever is best for you and and then I can give you more specific help you know based on what you're trying to do let's see Lorena says what does they recommend mid level of education or path to follow it really really depends on what you want to do since I'm in web development I'll give you kind of what what I would do to be a web developer and it depends on what you know so I'm going to assume like totally beginner level if if you already know that then you can just kind of skip some of these steps but totally beginner level I would start out with some basic stuff so free code camp dot org has like challenges that'll sort you out at a really low level you could work your way up as you're doing free code camp if you find another tutorial somewhere that you can learn more about a particular thing like no problem you can branch out and follow that and then come back that's how I did it if you if you don't particularly like that style of learning there are other styles so Udacity courses is more video based so I think it's udacity.com they of courses some are paid courses some are free courses they have a lot of free courses that are helpful for web development they're more video based so if you're into more video learning you can do that or watch YouTube videos of on free code camp if you like to just read like a book check out the book called you don't know Jas it's available for free to read on your computer on github so you can buy the actual book if you want or you can read it for free online but that would be a nice introduction to JavaScript just being able to read it all out so if you want to be a web developer though you know HTML CSS and then JavaScript or luego and usually in that order because HTML be the easiest CSS shouldn't be your that difficult to learn enough to do some cool stuff with and then Java scripts going to be the thing that you just keep on learning and learning and you kind of you never get finished learning it but it will allow you to do the most stuff and to get jobs that can make you the most money and you can do kind of the you can make more powerful things and cooler things with it so that's kind of I know that kind of a big overview hopefully that helps somewhat it's let me check the time all right I think I can finish this up Joey says the new context API seems pretty simple it can be understood in a matter of minutes it's just an alpha though so not ready for production yet okay yeah I I didn't think it was quite ready yet so yeah so maybe a while before we demo it but I'm really glad to know that it's it's simple Anthony asks what I used to stream with OBS so OBS is free software to help you stream so I just have that set up and then you know of course also YouTube alright I've gotten to the bottom hopefully I didn't miss anyone's questions I did skip over a few statements in there and that was just for time to apologize if I didn't read everything out all right cool so I have less than 10 minutes now thank you all for watching and for being so helpful when we were trying to go through this problem this seems like it's taking such a long time so thanks for your patience but I think we're really really close to having everything working with the sorting the way we want let me think anything else I only have anything else right now I will try to stream tomorrow around my normal time so around 12 noon if I can I'll let you know via Twitter if you want to follow me on Twitter also Instagram so you can check that out if you interested in any my videos you know check out my YouTube channel links in the description and yeah that's it for me so until tomorrow have a wonderful day
