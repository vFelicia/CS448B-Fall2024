00:02 - how's it going guys my name is dom and
00:05 - today i want to show you how to use
00:07 - iconography on your websites or your web
00:09 - applications using the iron icons
00:13 - library
00:14 - so basically iron icons is a free and
00:16 - open source icon set containing over 700
00:20 - icons for both the ios and material
00:24 - design styles so
00:26 - you can choose one of these two cells
00:28 - and use it for your icons so
00:31 - it actually comes packaged with the
00:33 - ionic framework itself but you can use
00:37 - it without the ionic framework so we're
00:40 - going to learn how to do that in this
00:42 - video so the first thing to do
00:44 - is to actually install the icon set in
00:47 - your html file so
00:50 - we can go to ionicons.com forward slash
00:53 - usage and then scroll down to the
00:55 - installation section we can now copy and
00:59 - paste this script tag
01:01 - inside our html file so
01:05 - for this file right here
01:07 - it looks like this
01:08 - we can just go down here and paste it
01:10 - right below the finishing sorry
01:13 - the end of the body tag so now we have
01:16 - the icon set installed inside the html
01:20 - file we can now use it very simply okay
01:23 - so the way this works is that
01:27 - each icon has its own web component so
01:32 - to use an icon below the h1 tag we can
01:35 - create a new tag
01:37 - it'll be the ion dash icon tag so
01:41 - this is a custom web component for the
01:43 - iron icon framework sorry the iron icon
01:47 - icon set or library okay so
01:52 - to specify what icon you want you can do
01:56 - so using the name attribute so inside
01:59 - here we're going to type out name
02:02 - equal to an empty string for now
02:04 - we're going to fill this with a prefix
02:07 - of the design to use followed by the
02:10 - actual icon name so back to the iron
02:13 - icons website
02:14 - we can go over to the icons section
02:17 - and then choose one of these icons let's
02:19 - choose the apps icon as an example
02:23 - right so
02:24 - if i choose this we get the name of the
02:27 - icon it's called apps
02:29 - so i can simply
02:32 - put apps inside here
02:34 - so if you're using the iron icons
02:37 - icon set with the ionic framework you
02:41 - can simply do this and you're done
02:43 - the design style is going to
02:46 - [Music]
02:47 - automatically be chosen based on the
02:51 - the os of the device it's running on but
02:54 - in this video we're looking at using it
02:56 - without the ionic framework so we have
02:59 - to actually specify the type of design
03:02 - to use so we have we have the material
03:05 - design
03:06 - or the ios
03:07 - design or style so we can see the
03:10 - difference between these two designs
03:11 - right here
03:12 - so to specify the actual design style
03:16 - we can prefix it with either md
03:19 - or ios so for example let's type out md
03:23 - dash apps just like that so now
03:27 - this will generate an svg of the apps
03:30 - icon for a material design
03:32 - so i can save this and refresh my
03:34 - browser and we get this right here an
03:38 - svg for the apps icon in material design
03:42 - okay perfect so
03:45 - we can simply change this to ios to
03:48 - achieve the ios version of that apps
03:50 - icon
03:51 - i can save this and refresh and we get
03:54 - this right here okay so pretty cool
03:57 - to actually customize this size and the
04:00 - color of these icons we can do so
04:03 - using a css or in the case of the the
04:07 - size we can use an attribute so for
04:09 - example i can say space and say size is
04:13 - equal to large to create a large icon
04:17 - i can save this and refresh and we get a
04:20 - bigger icon right there okay so to
04:23 - actually do that using css
04:25 - it's quite straightforward as well
04:28 - i'll get rid of this
04:29 - and go inside a new style tag
04:33 - and we're going to target every iron
04:35 - icon element inside the web page so
04:38 - we'll type our ion dash icon inside here
04:42 - we can put a font size
04:44 - property so we can say font size
04:47 - and the documentation recommends you use
04:50 - font sizes in multiples of eight so for
04:52 - example 8 16 32 or 64 and so on so
04:57 - let's say 64 pixels for this particular
05:01 - size i can save this and refresh and we
05:04 - get
05:04 - a much larger icon okay perfect
05:08 - we can also customize the color by using
05:11 - the css color property
05:13 - color
05:14 - and then blue
05:16 - okay i can save this and refresh and now
05:19 - we get this right here and that's how
05:22 - you can use
05:23 - the iron icons framework or sorry the
05:25 - iron icons library
05:27 - to achieve iconography inside your
05:30 - websites or your web applications right
05:33 - thanks for watching
05:34 - and i'll see you later
