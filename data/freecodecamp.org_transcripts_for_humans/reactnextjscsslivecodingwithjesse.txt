00:06 - hey everybody is Jessie and today I
00:13 - wasn't exactly sure what I'd be doing so
00:15 - that's why that's the title for this one
00:18 - is purposely vague right now
00:23 - I'm working on the the resources page
00:26 - and on the the new user interface for
00:30 - that page and I was actually just adding
00:34 - an atom package to to help with my code
00:39 - formatting so we talked about this
00:43 - yesterday I think Sebastian brought it
00:45 - up and I have it on my laptop but I'm
00:49 - gonna install it now so today it'll just
00:53 - be like maybe just some random things
00:57 - I'm getting to the end of the list here
00:59 - so let me show you
01:03 - so I showed you yesterday how much was
01:06 - left that I needed to get done basically
01:11 - most of it needs to get done be done
01:12 - this week I have maybe a day or two next
01:16 - week I think that I can work on this but
01:19 - it needs to be done but I was able to
01:22 - complete a few of them but then go
01:26 - through this and I moved I moved to
01:29 - bunch them up over here into this
01:30 - category so that if time allows I will
01:34 - do it so we'll see if I can get through
01:41 - this then maybe I'll do some of these
01:43 - but after I read through them again I
01:45 - realized you know some of them weren't
01:48 - they weren't as necessary as I thought
01:50 - they were when I first when I first put
01:53 - them in these rows so for at least for
01:58 - now we're gonna start out working on the
01:59 - UI which is already taking me longer
02:01 - than I thought it would take in
02:03 - particular right now I'm having this
02:07 - this problem so I have this drop-down
02:13 - and this uses a little bit of JavaScript
02:18 - some jQuery from the materialized
02:20 - framework so it needs to be initialized
02:23 - to be able to do this but what's
02:26 - happening is it's getting initialized
02:28 - before the data is populating so I need
02:36 - to figure I need to figure out a way to
02:39 - stop that from happening
02:46 - so I'm double checking right now that I
02:49 - actually have yeah so let me let me pull
02:55 - this over on to my others from my other
02:58 - screen just to show you kind of in the
03:03 - code what's going on make it a bit
03:05 - bigger it's too big okay so you see we
03:14 - have here's our all our data is coming
03:19 - in with our categories for resources so
03:23 - the people in charge of putting in the
03:27 - data which actually I think it's just
03:28 - one person right now is in charge of
03:30 - putting in data in in WordPress have
03:36 - evidently been putting in some
03:37 - categories which is awesome it gives us
03:39 - more data to work with so they're here
03:41 - they're getting put in here but you can
03:43 - see when this gets initialized what the
03:46 - user sees is you know this list but all
03:50 - that's in this list is the first option
03:53 - because that's hard-coded in there so I
03:56 - need to initialize it afterwards so I'm
04:02 - thinking maybe there's some lifecycle
04:04 - method in react that could help out with
04:06 - this so right now I've made a component
04:11 - for this select thing because I'll
04:13 - probably reuse this on other pages
04:15 - probably the blog page possibly the
04:18 - events page so I thought it'd be better
04:21 - just to pull this out into a component
04:26 - so within the component I put in
04:29 - component amount to initialize that
04:32 - select input so I'm thinking maybe I'll
04:36 - have have to find a different life cycle
04:41 - method and if you're not familiar with
04:44 - react that simply means like component
04:47 - did mount is a life cycle method is it's
04:50 - something that happens during a certain
04:54 - part of the life cycle like the life of
04:58 - a component so when a component is going
05:02 - to mount when it actually did mount when
05:04 - it's going to to update so there are a
05:07 - bunch of them until maybe we'll have to
05:10 - go to the react Docs and check out some
05:13 - other ones and try out and see if we can
05:16 - if we can get this working so other than
05:22 - that I had some pull requests so let me
05:26 - show you the new stuff had some good
05:28 - stuff in here let me find it I thought I
05:35 - had it ready but maybe I
05:40 - maybe I didn't yeah I must have
05:46 - navigated away from the page so I'll
05:51 - just bring this over so this will show
05:53 - one of the pull requests that I haven't
05:55 - brought in yet let me go
06:00 - hey everyone okay I just saw on the live
06:04 - staff and they said that he has a pull
06:07 - request so yeah it's it's we're gonna
06:09 - we're gonna check it out right now so
06:12 - this is Vinay's request which is pretty
06:15 - awesome so I have I pulled down the
06:20 - branch to my local machine and tested it
06:22 - out and it's working great
06:23 - I just haven't merged it in yet so
06:30 - basically what would Vinay's done and
06:34 - since since he's in the live chat he
06:36 - could explain it more in the live chat
06:38 - as well and if I mess something up
06:40 - explaining it he can correct me but
06:43 - basically he switched to using pre-act
06:45 - which is a smaller version of react
06:48 - right so he switched to that and it
06:54 - makes that everything smaller I'll just
06:56 - I'll show you and you can check it out
06:58 - as well this is on the repo but let me
07:03 - let me show you some of the things so
07:07 - you can see the bundle has gone from 271
07:13 - kilobytes down to 143 so it's pretty a
07:17 - significant drop you know
07:19 - percentage-wise and the size so that's
07:22 - really cool also he added this this
07:27 - analyze command here that will basically
07:31 - bring up a page like this and it shows
07:36 - you all the dependencies everything is
07:39 - going on in your build so it's really
07:43 - really cool
07:47 - and I was actually able to see I wonder
07:50 - if you can see it on here I don't know I
07:56 - thought when I ran it anyway there were
08:00 - some things that I'm not using in the
08:02 - newer versions that of the resource page
08:05 - like masonry that were in here that I
08:10 - could see that now will be gone so it's
08:12 - just kind of cool that I get a visual of
08:14 - everything that's going into the project
08:17 - and be able to see the size I was kind
08:21 - of surprised how you know some pages are
08:24 - bigger than others and trying to figure
08:27 - out why so really cool so you can if
08:32 - anybody wants to to check it out and try
08:34 - this or anything the the pool request is
08:39 - is here you know you can pull that down
08:41 - if you want I will be merging this in
08:43 - probably later on either later on today
08:47 - or tomorrow morning I'll be pulling that
08:49 - in I did want to ask this so I've never
08:53 - used pre X so I want to ask if if
08:58 - anybody has used pre X I'd like to know
09:03 - what your thoughts are on it did you
09:05 - have any issues with it so so far our
09:08 - testing it out just locally click like
09:10 - everything works there's no errors or
09:12 - anything happening so then they did a
09:14 - great job but since I've never used it
09:18 - before I just wondered you know should I
09:20 - be looking out for something I read
09:22 - through the docs a bit just to
09:24 - familiarize myself with it a little more
09:27 - but I'm I'd really like to hear your
09:32 - opinion on it you know so anybody that's
09:34 - used it please let me know if there's if
09:39 - there's no objections that I'm
09:40 - definitely gonna you know merge that in
09:42 - and use it so let me show you
09:45 - I had another request to and yesterday I
09:52 - talked about that Andrew had submitted a
09:57 - pull request based on
09:59 - on the search and then he also had some
10:03 - comments on how to make it even better
10:05 - so he actually went I opened up an issue
10:08 - and then he went and made a pull request
10:16 - that that did everything that he had
10:19 - recommended so really awesome so it
10:21 - looks like I mean it seems like he put
10:23 - in some time to this you know based on
10:25 - what always was changed and everything
10:27 - so he pulled in the debounce from lodash
10:31 - and used that so you can check out the
10:35 - code is all on the resources page now so
10:38 - you'll kind of see it as we're going
10:40 - through because we're going to be in the
10:41 - resources page and you can you know
10:45 - might go through it briefly just to see
10:46 - what was done but if you want to check
10:48 - it out in more depth this is actually on
10:51 - it's merged into the master branch now
10:53 - so you can see it in action I haven't
10:56 - pushed anything from master up to the
11:01 - live site yet so you can see it on
11:03 - github but you won't be able to actually
11:06 - use it unless I mean unless you wanted
11:09 - to download the whole repository and run
11:14 - it locally but I will be pushing things
11:17 - up yeah either later today or tomorrow
11:22 - so anyway Andrew thank you so much this
11:25 - was awesome and I really liked reading
11:27 - through the code both from Andrew and
11:30 - Vinay and just learning from what you
11:33 - both did so both of you thank you this
11:36 - was really awesome and I guess I'll show
11:41 - also the contributors page I actually
11:45 - like have this up on the screen just
11:47 - every time I start just so that you know
11:52 - like you're gonna get up there I guess
11:54 - if I started getting a ton of
11:55 - contributors they wouldn't fit on the
11:57 - screen but for now it's nice if I get
12:01 - any more it's gonna be a little tight
12:02 - maybe two more could fit but anyway I
12:06 - just want to make sure that you get the
12:08 - recognition you deserve for helping out
12:09 - so that's why I show this so
12:15 - let's I'm just going to jump right back
12:18 - in where I where I was before I started
12:21 - this dream and just continue on oh I got
12:27 - a few questions let me let me go over a
12:29 - couple of questions first in the live
12:31 - chat I mean it's just maybe two of them
12:33 - so Josh asked how to set up the night
12:37 - theme on github okay so I had a lot of
12:40 - questions about this yesterday so let me
12:45 - show you basically you need two things
12:48 - you need tampermonkey which is a plugin
12:54 - for Chrome so in the in the chrome I
12:57 - don't know if it's called a chrome store
12:59 - or I don't know what they call it but
13:00 - where you normally get chrome plugins
13:03 - from get tampermonkey then once you have
13:06 - tampermonkey you want to get the github
13:11 - dark and i'll copy let's see let me get
13:20 - the URL and I'll just put it in the chat
13:32 - alright it looks like the update URL on
13:35 - the download URL is the same thing so
13:37 - this URL is where you should be able to
13:42 - download this code so you'll want to run
13:46 - this in tampermonkey and then enable it
13:51 - for github which I think it's all setup
13:55 - for I don't think you really have to
13:56 - setup anything else except just put this
13:59 - code into tampermonkey so that's
14:02 - basically it you may have to if you
14:03 - don't know how to use tampermonkey you
14:05 - may have to mess around with it for a
14:06 - bit but it's really not hard I think
14:09 - it's it's pretty straightforward it's
14:13 - basically just a place where you can put
14:16 - JavaScript and have it run when you go
14:20 - to a certain site automatically so you
14:22 - put it in the JavaScript and you say
14:24 - which site to run it on and it runs
14:27 - really straightforward and then once you
14:32 - have it on there you you have this new
14:35 - Settings panel this github dark Settings
14:37 - panel and you could do you could change
14:40 - everything you could customize it you
14:42 - could even go into the code and make
14:44 - your own theme if you wanted to I just
14:48 - use the default theme that came with it
14:50 - I haven't even looked at any of the
14:51 - other themes yet but I guess it would be
14:56 - cool to match match it up to the theme
14:58 - that I use in my code editors so the
15:00 - highlighting would be the same but for
15:03 - now I'm happy with it how it is ok the
15:08 - other question I had was let's see
15:12 - I lost it no okay Adam so Adam asks did
15:17 - you graduate from fus which is
15:18 - Franciscan University of student Moodle
15:20 - so that's that's the university that I
15:25 - work for so no I actually didn't
15:27 - graduate from fus so I went to actually
15:32 - the cheapest college in the state of
15:35 - West Virginia and if you're not familiar
15:37 - with West Virginia it's one of the
15:39 - poorest states in the United States of
15:41 - America so obviously the United States
15:44 - of America
15:45 - in terms of you know average income it's
15:49 - higher than a lot of other places so
15:51 - when I say poorest states it's relative
15:54 - to the United States which basically
15:58 - means to be considered poor in the
16:01 - United States you know by government
16:03 - standards you can still have a house and
16:05 - a car and cable television and Internet
16:07 - and so it's not really like you're
16:10 - you're destitute but basically the
16:14 - school I went to was so cheap I think I
16:16 - only ended up paying like four hundred
16:18 - dollars or something to go there after
16:20 - you took into account like scholarships
16:22 - and I did get student loan money and
16:27 - things but I ended up investing my
16:29 - student loan money since I didn't need
16:31 - to use it I guess I needed to buy books
16:33 - oh I take that I did have to pay for my
16:36 - book so that that cost a little bit more
16:38 - but I ended up making seven hundred
16:40 - dollars off of investing my student loan
16:42 - money and then whenever I was done with
16:44 - school I just paid it back immediately
16:45 - before I had to start paying interest so
16:49 - so everybody is always talking about how
16:52 - much school cost but I think I actually
16:54 - made money off of college so I was I was
16:59 - a business major and I was wanted to be
17:02 - a stockbroker so that was very in line
17:05 - with what I wanted to do but anyway the
17:09 - Franciscan University is quite a bit
17:11 - more expensive than the university I
17:14 - went to which was West Liberty State
17:16 - College it's West Liberty University now
17:19 - they changed the name but when I went
17:20 - there was just State State College but
17:24 - anyway Franciscan University is is not
17:27 - like one of the most expensive colleges
17:29 - out there it's it's pretty affordable
17:31 - for what it is but it is a private a
17:33 - small private college so small private
17:36 - colleges usually are more expensive so
17:38 - anyways sorry for all that none of that
17:41 - really had anything to do with code but
17:42 - and it was a long answer to a simple
17:45 - question but I just always like to tell
17:49 - the story about me making money off of
17:51 - off of college of my college loans back
17:56 - then the interest rates were a lot
17:58 - higher so you could you could make more
18:01 - money off of really safe investments and
18:08 - something like money market funds and
18:10 - stuff at high high interest rates let's
18:19 - see-oh ahead here we go right off the
18:22 - bat we have a question about the text
18:24 - the text out of the code editor so
18:27 - Sebastian says Windows notepad for the
18:30 - win I actually used no pen to start
18:34 - learning how to how to code so that was
18:38 - the first thing I learned out of code on
18:40 - back in I think like 2003 maybe 2002
18:46 - somewhere around there so something like
18:48 - somewhere around there I think I learned
18:50 - on notepad which was was super fun so
18:57 - it's somewhat sarcastic it was fun to
18:59 - learn how to do it but doing it on
19:01 - notepad was not fun anyway I'll keep it
19:05 - short in terms of talking about the
19:07 - editors and you all can talk about as
19:10 - much as you on the live chat I like Adam
19:14 - because I've been using at them and I
19:15 - have a lot of packages set up and Adam a
19:18 - lot of plugins but I also use Visual
19:21 - Studio code occasionally and I will say
19:23 - it seems faster than Adam so one day
19:28 - maybe I'll switch if I ever take the
19:30 - time to set up you know similar packages
19:32 - in Visual Studio code but those are the
19:36 - only ones I really have very much
19:37 - experience with I did use notepad plus
19:41 - plus when I was developing on
19:43 - a Windows computer before I switch I
19:49 - switched from notepad plus plus to Adam
19:50 - like years ago so no plaid plus plus was
19:57 - okay at the time I wouldn't have said I
19:59 - was a serious developer at that point so
20:01 - it it worked but I thought it would
20:03 - never go back to it
20:13 - okay so let me let me get back and do
20:17 - some coding and then I'll check back in
20:19 - in the in the live chat and so if you've
20:24 - asked a question stick around for a
20:25 - couple minutes and I'll check back in
20:27 - but I'd like to try to do keep a nice
20:30 - balance between coding and and the chat
20:34 - if I can all right so the problem the
20:38 - problem right now is how do we get this
20:41 - to initialize after the data's come in
20:45 - and the potential solution is let's look
20:48 - up life cycle methods for react
20:51 - components
21:05 - I guess I'll go the official Doc's are
21:08 - probably a good place to go so let me
21:11 - make this bigger and I could probably
21:18 - make this a little bit bigger on the
21:23 - screen - okay so we're already using
21:26 - component did mount and obviously that's
21:29 - not working for us right now so any
21:31 - lifecycle methods that happen before
21:34 - that are not going to be of any use to
21:36 - us so maybe maybe component did update
21:50 - the other thing is is this says when
21:52 - it's when it's being re-rendered it's
21:56 - possible that this will always fire
21:59 - since we're making an API call to get
22:03 - the data for that so that might work
22:06 - it's worth a try so which I component
22:10 - did update
22:20 - and let's check out see what's going on
22:25 - oh hey it worked they're awesome I want
22:29 - to do do two things I want to try a full
22:32 - refresh and then I want to try to you
22:34 - know do click on these links to do that
22:36 - client-side routing and make sure it
22:38 - still works so let's go to events and
22:41 - then we'll come back all right that
22:47 - works awesome so here's a good tip I've
22:54 - had for some reason I've had a few
22:56 - questions about using jQuery with react
23:01 - so I had a discussion on Twitter about
23:04 - it recently and in a live chat I've had
23:06 - some comments about it we did a stream
23:09 - about it before but this is some good
23:11 - advice so if you need a component to
23:15 - have some data that you're waiting on
23:18 - first and then initialize it component
23:22 - did update seems like it's the way to go
23:29 - all right so that's all that and that
23:33 - was a much faster fix I'm so glad that's
23:35 - something that I've fixed more quickly
23:37 - than I thought usually it's the other
23:39 - way I think something's gonna be easy
23:41 - and then end up spending an hour on it
23:44 - but the next thing is I don't really
23:49 - want to keep this with the discolor
23:51 - that's not it's not the color so I got
23:55 - to decide what color I want to make this
23:56 - do I want to keep it white or not and
24:00 - then what color text I know this
24:06 - background is black but I really I don't
24:09 - want to make this black I'm not even
24:13 - sure that I want to keep this black for
24:14 - now anyway but I'm not gonna mess with
24:17 - it right now at the very least I'll
24:21 - change these colors to this red color
24:23 - that we're using for lengths here and I
24:27 - think I'll just leave it at that for now
24:30 - and if I get any ideas on something else
24:32 - I think that should be okay I wonder how
24:38 - many categories they're gonna add in
24:39 - here I was just saying this this may end
24:41 - up becoming quite large which I mean I
24:46 - guess that's if that's what they want to
24:47 - do that's fine might be difficult to
24:49 - scroll through everything at least it's
24:53 - in alphabetical order so that should
24:55 - help get through it
24:57 - so I'm going to grab the the hex color
25:01 - for this and then apply it here I'm
25:05 - gonna check out in dev tools quickly
25:08 - what that color what that color is where
25:12 - I need to put it
25:19 - where is this
25:30 - I think that it's not try this again
25:34 - there we go that's what I wanted
25:37 - okay so here's what we want the span
25:47 - inside the Li so looks like the
25:52 - drop-down content will change the color
25:55 - here so let me just grab this let me see
26:01 - my component
26:07 - yeah I'm gonna I was I'm glad this
26:13 - happened because I I've discovered
26:16 - something else
26:17 - that doesn't work when I'm using jQuery
26:20 - okay so on some of my components you can
26:25 - see that I've used like this CSS you
26:30 - know right here either in a style tag or
26:33 - you know directly in line so when I'm
26:36 - using these things from the materialized
26:38 - framework that use jQuery to manipulate
26:41 - the Dom which really I just don't have
26:46 - time to rewrite them in a better way for
26:49 - react but let me see basically what's
26:56 - gonna happen is I can't put it in line
26:58 - because that I mean you can see here
27:00 - that list all those outlines don't even
27:02 - exist those get added in when it's
27:04 - initialized I can't put it in that style
27:08 - JSX tag because what that ends up doing
27:13 - see if we can find something okay so
27:19 - what ends up happening is like here it's
27:22 - given this data
27:25 - - JSX number and that's what's used see
27:31 - if I can find a style for this okay so
27:35 - that's what's used for these Styles so
27:37 - if you could see over here the stuff in
27:40 - the style JSX tag and the component ends
27:43 - up being converted into something like
27:44 - this where it uses these IDs well
27:48 - what'll happen is if your component has
27:54 - features that are going to be
27:56 - dynamically added after the fact then
27:59 - it's not going to get one of these these
28:01 - IDs so whatever in the background does
28:06 - all this is not even going to see those
28:09 - elements so you can't use that so you
28:11 - basically have to go back to plain old
28:14 - style sheets so I was trying my best to
28:17 - get everything I could
28:18 - out of this stylesheet and I found I was
28:21 - I was trying to get take as much as I
28:24 - couldn't put it in the components and it
28:26 - wasn't working and that's how I
28:27 - eventually found out hey it doesn't work
28:30 - if you're adding things dynamically so
28:34 - I'm still gonna have to keep some things
28:36 - in the stylesheet I won't be able to put
28:39 - it all in the style JSX tags so anyway
28:44 - just wanted to fill you all in on that
28:46 - in case you were working with something
28:48 - similar so what I need to do then I
28:51 - think I copied what I had to copy but I
28:54 - need to put it in this style dot CSS and
28:58 - I'm just gonna throw it down the bottom
29:00 - so my CSS file is a mess I was trying to
29:05 - edit things earlier and it's like really
29:09 - I guess I didn't copy what I thought I
29:11 - copied but it's actually getting really
29:13 - hard to edit things because the CSS is
29:17 - just all over the place so I really need
29:21 - to take some time and and work on that
29:26 - if I do get time which I don't know if
29:29 - I'll have time any time soon but that's
29:33 - also if you're if you're kind of just
29:35 - starting out and you want to get a you
29:39 - know you want to build up your github
29:41 - profile that might be something somewhat
29:44 - simple to start out with just to go
29:46 - through and mess around and see how much
29:49 - of the Styles here you could pull out
29:52 - you could either take out completely
29:54 - because I've already duplicated it in
29:56 - the components or pull it out and put it
29:59 - in the components make sure it still
30:00 - works that's just kind of tedious work
30:02 - that's not difficult but it just takes
30:06 - time to do in the tests so I know
30:10 - sometimes it can be hard starting out
30:12 - contributing to projects so it's good if
30:14 - there's some kind of like easier tasks
30:23 - and as always I don't I don't expect
30:27 - anyone to contribute to this this
30:29 - project you know I I'm happy of y'all
30:31 - just watching and everything but if you
30:33 - want to I really do appreciate that let
30:39 - me see I need to grab the color I
30:42 - thought I had it out here somewhere I
30:45 - guess would be done yep I have it done
30:47 - here I will say this if I was really
30:54 - setting this project up in a better way
30:56 - right off the bat I would have like CSS
31:00 - that gets imported and I could probably
31:05 - have I could probably be running SAS
31:07 - have variables for my colors potentially
31:12 - I could even set up like real JavaScript
31:14 - variables since I'm using you know
31:18 - JavaScript within or I'm using CSS
31:22 - within the JavaScript so there's a lot
31:25 - of different ways I could do this that
31:27 - are better if you haven't been watching
31:28 - you know from the beginning this was a
31:31 - conversion from a static site so a lot
31:34 - of this is just left over and in reality
31:36 - some of the things that are still in
31:38 - this CSS file aren't even being used at
31:40 - all because they were even pulled over
31:43 - from a previous site that was entirely
31:47 - different at a different color scheme
31:49 - and but it was a good jump start to this
31:52 - project so there are things that are in
31:55 - here that have never been used on this
31:57 - project that just never got taken out so
32:02 - I'm not saying that's a good way to do
32:04 - things or just explaining this the
32:06 - current state of the project so I need
32:09 - to do a hard refresh because I don't I
32:12 - don't get to refresh when I edit a CSS
32:14 - file the auto refresh okay that looks a
32:18 - lot nicer than the yellow it's
32:21 - definitely easier to read and it fits
32:23 - better with the color scheme alright
32:26 - that works now I actually I don't think
32:30 - I have this working yet
32:33 - yeah it doesn't work so maybe we'll do
32:37 - that so I did get get this working which
32:43 - this wasn't difficult it was just a
32:45 - matter of adapting the code that I think
32:48 - Fabian had done a pull request and I
32:50 - just needed to adapt it so that I wasn't
32:52 - using masonry and I was instead using
32:54 - these I can see this I'm not getting the
33:06 - the border on this top one so I'm not
33:10 - really worried about it now because I
33:12 - think bill who's frequently in Live Chat
33:16 - sent me some code to do a nice effect
33:18 - with a horizontal rule instead of a
33:20 - border so I'll probably replace that
33:21 - anyway so I'm not going to worry about
33:22 - that right now but let me commit this
33:28 - before we go on to the next thing and
33:32 - I'll do it on on this screen so you all
33:36 - can see especially if you're if you're
33:39 - new to get into the command line they'll
33:41 - give you a little bit of extra a little
33:49 - extra info about it I'll explain it as I
33:51 - go along so we're on a separate branch
33:55 - we're not on the master branch we're
33:56 - doing all this new stuff on the new
33:58 - resource UI branch so if you want to
34:01 - follow along in the in the repo on
34:04 - github that's the branch we're on so
34:06 - we're gonna do a get status just to make
34:09 - sure what's change okay occasionally you
34:13 - do a get status and you see something
34:14 - that's changed and you don't know why so
34:16 - I always like to do it unless I'm
34:19 - absolutely sure what's changed and it's
34:22 - only a minor thing I always want to
34:23 - check so resources component has changed
34:28 - the style sheet has changed and then
34:30 - I've added this material select
34:31 - component so that's good there's what
34:33 - that's expected so we can do get add and
34:38 - put a dot to add everything and you can
34:44 - see now everything's ready
34:46 - for me to add a commit message to and
34:53 - then I can take it commit and then if I
34:56 - put the M flag I can put my message
34:59 - right here if I leave out that flag and
35:02 - I just hit Enter when I hit get commit
35:04 - it will pull up whatever your preferred
35:07 - editor is which by default might be Nano
35:11 - but for me I think I set mine to be atom
35:14 - so then you would have to put in your
35:16 - message otherwise like that if you have
35:19 - a really long message that's probably
35:21 - the better way to go but this is faster
35:23 - if you have a short message so in this
35:24 - case mine would be
35:37 - mmm I don't think I've really done
35:41 - anything else that's that pretty much
35:45 - sums up what I've done I think we have
35:53 - an error oops
35:56 - so an it select it's not defined so what
36:00 - I need to do is just put in an exception
36:02 - so that it doesn't throw this error
36:05 - anymore so that's cool I'm glad it
36:09 - through that error because I don't think
36:10 - I ever explained live why I needed to
36:15 - make these exceptions okay so let me
36:19 - show you so up here I've needed to put
36:25 - this in so what I'm using some type of
36:29 - like an it function that I have here in
36:32 - my app is file I've done this it throws
36:38 - an error if I try to use it without
36:39 - putting this and so in it and it select
36:48 - so now we'll ignore the fact that this
36:53 - is not defined so there are better ways
36:57 - to do this as well - this was kind of a
36:59 - workaround to get all my jQuery stuff to
37:01 - work now we'll try again it should work
37:08 - this time well that's alright so that
37:11 - works
37:15 - and I'm gonna push that right up to get
37:18 - it up immediately so y'all can see it if
37:20 - you want to and I'm gonna check in the
37:21 - live chat now since there's quite a bit
37:24 - going on in there and I don't want to
37:25 - get too far behind
37:27 - so next step I'm saying this out loud so
37:30 - I don't forget as well next step is
37:32 - going to be actually hooking this up so
37:35 - when he click one of these it actually
37:37 - works and it filters okay so the Nate
37:45 - says check out pre-act compact which I
37:47 - used it adds react compatibility layer
37:50 - for pre-act
37:51 - the only issue I face is with react
37:54 - transition group for which we can alias
37:57 - to our C CSS transition group okay so I
38:01 - did read a little bit about the pre-act
38:03 - contest so I saw that that's what you
38:06 - had had used but in the I guess it was
38:10 - in the package.json file I saw that so
38:14 - that's if you're just joining and you
38:17 - didn't hear at the beginning vinay had
38:19 - submitted a pull request that would
38:21 - shift everything over to pre-act which
38:23 - is a more lightweight kind of version of
38:25 - react and he's also added something so
38:29 - that it's compatible with what we've
38:31 - already done called pre at compat so
38:34 - vinay saying there's one issue so I'm
38:38 - not exactly sure with the with the issue
38:41 - is I mean Vinay it sounds like you know
38:44 - you have a handle on it
38:46 - just let me know is this an issue that
38:49 - should I wait on pushing this you know
38:53 - out to the live site to production or if
38:56 - should it be okay because I I have no
38:59 - experience at all with pre act so I'm
39:01 - relying relying on you on Vinay and all
39:04 - of you to fill me in on any potential
39:08 - pitfalls
39:14 - okay let's see
39:16 - hey zan is here hey Ben didn't notice I
39:22 - saw it yesterday I was and I saw you'd
39:25 - said goodbye and then I didn't even get
39:27 - to that part so sorry I did say goodbye
39:31 - on the video but I think you'd already
39:32 - gone but so a belated goodbye and hello
39:36 - nah okay all right now I see most of
39:43 - what was in the lab chat was still
39:44 - talking about code editors as usual
39:57 - okay I see now as Anna just said
40:00 - yesterday when I said I was sorry I
40:01 - meant sorry had a rough tough weekend
40:03 - you know what I am when I was driving
40:07 - home from work yesterday I it hit me
40:10 - that that's what you were talking about
40:11 - and I felt like an idiot because I had I
40:15 - just totally forgot sometimes it's it's
40:18 - hard it's hard to keep since I can't
40:21 - keep up with the live chat and code at
40:24 - the same time and I have to take breaks
40:25 - it frequently happens that I forget what
40:29 - I had said you know just a few minutes
40:31 - before and then you you were you all
40:34 - were responding to what I had said but I
40:36 - I just don't I don't get it because I
40:38 - don't remember so I don't really know
40:40 - the way around that because there's
40:43 - there's just usually a lot of activity
40:45 - in the live chat so I really can't I
40:49 - don't think I could do both I couldn't
40:52 - respond to every message as it came in
40:54 - in real time and still code so but I'll
40:57 - do my best to try to remember that but
40:59 - anyway thank you for that Anna I
41:02 - appreciate that
41:03 - I had we had we had a loss in a family
41:07 - over the weekend so yeah I was just
41:10 - pretty down about that and I think I
41:13 - didn't realize it yesterday but this
41:15 - morning I woke up I think I'm starting
41:16 - to get sick like a cold or something my
41:19 - throat's a bit swollen and it hurts so
41:22 - that might have been adding to it but
41:24 - it's just feeling you know a little
41:27 - weird and down like out I don't know if
41:32 - they were happy to you but I was
41:33 - literally like I was sitting here I was
41:35 - working yesterday morning you know
41:37 - writing some code and like I didn't know
41:39 - where it was just like I felt like I was
41:41 - gonna start crying
41:42 - and it just passed over me it was like
41:45 - five seconds and then I was I was okay
41:48 - but I was like man Leawood is going on I
41:50 - think it was just like the emotion of
41:53 - everything that happened like I just was
41:55 - really busy and it hadn't hit me until
41:57 - like that point and then it just all hit
41:59 - me at once and then I was okay but we'll
42:06 - see I'm actually gonna go see I go to a
42:08 - counselor
42:09 - once a month and just for some like
42:12 - minor depression and stuff but I see you
42:15 - later today so in a couple hours so
42:18 - maybe I'll bring it up and make sure I'm
42:19 - not going crazy or anything but anyway
42:23 - enough enough about my mental health
42:24 - sorry for the for the tangent
42:37 - okay we had a question so Viper I behave
42:41 - I'm not sure if or announce that I
42:43 - really sorry I I know I probably messed
42:45 - that up it's vai be hav says unemployed
42:50 - I stay at home all day how can I keep
42:52 - learning to code and build projects how
42:54 - can I be productive I would say if if
43:00 - the trouble is like just staying
43:02 - motivated to be productive try to find
43:06 - projects that you you really care about
43:09 - and then maybe that'll be extra
43:11 - motivation if it's something you can get
43:16 - excited about then I think it'll be a
43:18 - lot easier for you to keep going also
43:22 - this is somewhat I guess unrelated to
43:24 - coding but I found it's helped me out as
43:25 - well if I can get in a little bit of
43:28 - exercise you know every day I find that
43:32 - I just have more energy and motivation
43:34 - I'm much more likely to actually do
43:37 - something and sometimes I'll get a bit
43:40 - of exercise and a solution to some
43:43 - coding problem will come to me while I'm
43:45 - I'm exercising and so I don't I think
43:47 - there's something about the effect of
43:49 - exercise on the brain that helps you
43:51 - work through problems like that so if
43:53 - that's a possibility for you as well
43:55 - that would that could could help but I
44:01 - know it's tough I went through a period
44:04 - of being unemployed and then I've gone
44:07 - through when I was freelancing I've gone
44:08 - through periods of not really having you
44:11 - know clients or not a lot of clients you
44:13 - know and those are tough periods too to
44:16 - try to go through but you try to like
44:20 - set a schedule for yourself and try to
44:22 - be consistent you know that can help to
44:24 - set some goals but hopefully but you
44:31 - know keep keep me informed keep us
44:33 - informed maybe it would be good if you
44:35 - know occasionally if you can join us for
44:37 - the live chat and just let us know what
44:39 - you're working on everything then that
44:42 - might help as well that you know you
44:44 - might get excited about you know filling
44:47 - us in on what you're doing
44:48 - and if I see you if I remember and I see
44:51 - you in a live chat you know it in the
44:53 - future I'll ask you how things are going
44:57 - so you have a unique name I haven't seen
45:01 - anybody else of that name so hopefully
45:02 - I'll remember and I could ask you anyway
45:06 - hopefully that advice helps I'm sure you
45:09 - know people in the live chat have some
45:10 - great advice as well Court Court says in
45:18 - Russia computers have only two gigabytes
45:20 - hard disk that's crazy it's that serious
45:27 - as anybody else from Russia can you
45:29 - verify that because that sounds really
45:31 - really crazy I mean if you were like on
45:35 - a Chromebook in that cloud storage it
45:37 - that would be fine but yeah really crazy
45:43 - Jordan asks what packages do you use I
45:45 - don't know I use I have a lot of
45:47 - different packages so I don't know I
45:51 - can't really go through them now maybe
45:52 - I'll try to make a video on all the
45:54 - packages I'm using I guess I could while
45:59 - I'm going through some of the questions
46:01 - in the live chat I'll put up on the
46:02 - screen the packages I have I need to
46:05 - configure this but I won't do it on on
46:08 - the screen because that'd be kind of
46:10 - boring but if you want the style JSX tag
46:15 - to be highlighted properly there's a
46:17 - little bit of code you have to put in
46:18 - here so I'll need to find out where that
46:21 - code is and copy and paste that I think
46:24 - it's in the documentation for next j/s
46:25 - so if you wanted to use this to get
46:29 - better you know syntax highlighting and
46:31 - things and auto indentation just now you
46:34 - have to put that little bit of code in
46:36 - so let me show you here's here's just
46:40 - some of the packages I have I know this
46:43 - is a little bit small but if I make it
46:44 - bigger you won't be able to see as many
46:46 - so I'll leave this up here for now and
46:48 - I'll scroll down a bit in a few minutes
46:50 - that way you can see what I'm using the
46:54 - court court says no coding I want write
46:56 - code now
47:00 - is they are you meaning that I should
47:02 - quit talking and write code or what or
47:04 - you want to write kiss either way if you
47:08 - want to write code go ahead but I'll get
47:11 - to the code in just another minute
47:13 - there's not a lot left here in the in
47:15 - the live chat okay Sebastian said that
47:18 - yellow is unreadable at least in the
47:19 - stream is Hannah agrees yeah for sure
47:21 - that yellow I've had issues with that I
47:24 - actually found a slightly different
47:25 - shade of that yellow that works a lot
47:28 - better so I've used it in some other
47:30 - sites if you if you like if you convert
47:34 - the color from a hex color into like the
47:36 - H hlsa color or something I might have
47:39 - those in the wrong order the you can
47:42 - darken it right so you can keep
47:45 - basically the same color but darken it a
47:46 - bit and then it makes it much more
47:48 - readable but it doesn't really change
47:51 - the color that much so it appears to be
47:54 - the same color but it's just a lot more
47:56 - readable so I've switched to that color
47:59 - on my newer projects but I think the one
48:03 - that was still there was leftover and
48:06 - kind of like the base theme that I
48:08 - always use for university websites oh as
48:16 - Anna said I hate it when CSS is all over
48:19 - the place yes yes they'd say just it
48:22 - just happened you know at some point you
48:26 - just started getting so much CSS and if
48:29 - you don't like me if I just I didn't I
48:31 - just didn't stay on top of things and
48:34 - then I got out of control
48:35 - so I'll have to keep that in mind the
48:40 - next time I'm doing a project so that
48:42 - I'm more disciplined about my
48:44 - organization right off the bat okay
48:49 - Sebastian says you can import your CSS
48:53 - and the components you can make a CSS
48:56 - file per component so yeah Sebastian
48:58 - that's that's a better way to do it and
49:00 - that's what I'll if I have time I'll
49:02 - probably go that route the reason as I
49:05 - said that it was in one big component or
49:09 - one big file was because that that's how
49:11 - it was
49:12 - in the site that I I came over from so
49:16 - you just never got around to actually
49:19 - splitting it up okay Jeremy like said a
49:25 - couple things and then retracted and
49:27 - said never mind I got it so so glad you
49:30 - got it here on Evo or Ivo Ivo says hey
49:39 - James I've been following the live
49:40 - stream along for a little while and I
49:42 - understood that you have built a
49:43 - reactive website with WordPress as the
49:45 - backend and then Sebastian corrected as
49:52 - Jesse yes it's cool I know what you
49:58 - meant actually when you said that it
50:02 - reminded me of the characters from
50:04 - Pokemon just like the Team Rocket
50:05 - members once named Jesse and other ones
50:08 - James it's like my kids are really into
50:11 - Pokemon right now so that's immediately
50:14 - I thought of that so anyway to continue
50:20 - on Iowa says I'm really curious as to
50:24 - how this worked out for you and what the
50:26 - lessons you learned about this project
50:28 - my previous internship used to Drupal
50:30 - backend and its HTML engine so Zanna did
50:34 - explain he just uses the WordPress API
50:38 - to pull data out from another website
50:39 - that that is true yeah then he thought
50:45 - apologized for I getting the name wrong
50:48 - it don't worry about it
50:50 - it's not a big deal so anyway he said
50:55 - the solution with the Drupal engine
50:57 - usually involve writing custom
50:58 - JavaScript code which always overwrote
51:00 - each other and made a huge mess of the
51:02 - HTML as well as the application state
51:05 - yeah that sounds like a mess yeah so
51:10 - anyway legs Anna said since I'm not it
51:14 - I'm just taking the data that's entered
51:17 - into WordPress and I'm not using their
51:19 - templating system at all so that kind of
51:23 - eliminates a lot of the issues that I
51:25 - would
51:26 - if I was trying to work in to the actual
51:30 - like the templates I'm not sure what the
51:32 - terminology is in Drupal I haven't
51:34 - worked with Drupal that much so I'm like
51:37 - the terminology might be a bit different
51:39 - from Drupal WordPress but you know
51:41 - normally these templates are made in PHP
51:43 - and then they get rendered server-side
51:46 - with PHP and HTML if I was trying to use
51:50 - Java scripts or real react in particular
51:52 - with that I probably would have run into
51:55 - more issues but since I'm doing it this
51:58 - way and I'm basically just dealing with
52:00 - data coming in the form of JSON it makes
52:04 - it a lot easier so I actually am
52:08 - interested though and how you would
52:11 - potentially do the similar thing with
52:13 - Drupal because there are some sites
52:15 - connected with this site that I'm
52:16 - building that are built on Drupal so
52:19 - there's a learning management system
52:21 - that is that this site is going to
52:26 - direct people to and then they'll go and
52:28 - they'll sign up and it's like I think a
52:31 - yearly fee or something and they'll be
52:32 - able to take all these courses that
52:34 - system is built on Drupal and then
52:36 - there's another site that's a magazine
52:38 - that's associated with with this website
52:42 - and that site is built on Drupal as well
52:44 - so potentially if I could expose Drupal
52:47 - data through some sort of API I could
52:49 - pull it into this site as well that
52:52 - would be nice because the people
52:53 - entering in data wouldn't have to
52:55 - duplicate data so I'm interested in in
52:59 - that I don't have direct access to any
53:01 - of those Drupal sites like it to the
53:04 - backend so I couldn't implement anything
53:06 - but there's an outside company that that
53:10 - is building those so potentially you
53:13 - know they would have to set up the API
53:14 - and then I could use it but I assume
53:20 - that Drupal could do something similar
53:22 - to what the WordPress API does it'd be
53:26 - even better if it would use graph QL
53:28 - instead of a regular REST API but that
53:33 - would be ideal if you if you don't
53:36 - haven't heard of graph QL check it out
53:39 - it's
53:39 - GRA pH and then the letter Q and the
53:42 - letter L really really cool what's it's
53:45 - like I I suspect that it's gradually
53:49 - gonna take over a lot of things that use
53:52 - a REST API now we'll switch to graph QL
53:55 - but for right now there wasn't an easy
53:58 - way to do that with WordPress so that's
54:00 - why I just stuck with a normal API
54:09 - oh no Sebastian said apparently what I
54:11 - said about CSS doesn't work on next Jas
54:14 - oh I'll have to keep that in mind so
54:16 - splitting up things into like separate
54:23 - CSS files for components doesn't work so
54:25 - off to check that out more there's got
54:29 - to be some better way to do it also
54:33 - Sebastian mentioned by the way you're
54:34 - missing the border bottom in the first
54:37 - item from the list yeah I did I saw that
54:40 - let me let me switch back to here
54:46 - actually let me let me put up while I'm
54:48 - going through this I'm gonna put up the
54:49 - code all here I had the code on the
54:52 - screen what am I thinking I want to put
54:54 - this up here so you can see some of the
54:59 - stuff that Andrew did to change
55:03 - basically make the the search function a
55:08 - little bit better so it won't make so
55:10 - many API calls it works better with like
55:15 - the mobile virtual keyboard so you just
55:17 - kind of check this out now of course
55:19 - this also on the github page Sebastian
55:28 - says sorry to hear about that yeah I
55:31 - appreciate that
55:32 - thanks for saying as anna says we're
55:34 - humans not robots crying his natural
55:39 - yeah that's true that's sure it was just
55:43 - odd to have it happen like right in the
55:45 - middle of just just working just going
55:48 - more often and nature helps a lot
55:51 - actually that's a good idea I haven't
55:54 - spent that much time outside for a while
55:57 - I did go to the beach a couple weeks ago
55:59 - so I just went some time at the beach
56:01 - but that might not be a bad idea I
56:04 - actually have like my my house has a
56:09 - little over an acre of land around it
56:12 - and part of it is just like yeah it's
56:15 - just a bunch of trees and stuff so but I
56:18 - rarely get out and actually enjoy it I'm
56:21 - always you know coding or something so
56:24 - maybe I ought to just go out and walk
56:26 - around take the kids they'd probably
56:29 - like that
56:33 - okay Zanna had some advice for the vibe
56:38 - have which like I said I'm sure I'm
56:40 - probably mispronouncing your name if you
56:43 - want to try to explain how to pronounce
56:45 - your name I I will definitely try to
56:47 - pronounce it correctly from now on but
56:49 - anyway the advice is write emails for
56:50 - startups out there I'm sure you could
56:52 - find an internship the best way to learn
56:54 - is coding real stuff small tasks so
56:58 - anyway that's that's great advice I
57:03 - wouldn't never even thought about that
57:05 - of just emailing different companies for
57:08 - internships and stuff but that's a
57:09 - really good idea Jeremy says in the same
57:14 - boat but the live chat helps me a I'm
57:17 - really glad that this the live chat is
57:19 - helping helping you all I do
57:22 - I think the latch that is one of the
57:23 - best parts about about this that's why I
57:26 - take so much time to try to read out
57:27 - everything that I can in the live chat
57:29 - for the people who are watching later on
57:31 - because if the if the show was just me
57:34 - talking it wouldn't I mean it would not
57:37 - be nearly as good and helpful for people
57:39 - I think you all make it so much better
57:51 - okay yeah ratha asks can we watch this
57:54 - afterwards and Umberto's says yes the
57:56 - video is posted in about five minutes
57:59 - thanks for answering that I'm just
58:01 - reading it out loud for in case you know
58:03 - anybody else I imagine there might be
58:05 - some people watching this they can't
58:06 - look at the live chat for whatever
58:08 - reason maybe they're they're just
58:11 - listening to it and doing other things
58:12 - so I just wanted to read that out for
58:16 - those people Zanna recommends let's see
58:28 - following sites like remote okay or
58:32 - internships and found a startup cool so
58:37 - Zanna actually was able to find a
58:39 - start-up for an internship so that's
58:42 - that's awesome so that's definitely
58:44 - really good advice so if you're in that
58:45 - same position you know just trying to
58:48 - get some experience and you know just
58:50 - doing doing side projects and things you
58:54 - know definitely try to get a hold of
58:56 - companies you like and get an internship
58:58 - I vote says I checked out graph QL
59:04 - before and it's really interesting would
59:06 - recommend it as well you pronounce my
59:07 - name is Eva okay awesome Dutch
59:12 - pronunciation is weird okay cool alright
59:14 - so I'll try to remember that so Evo
59:17 - that's that's actually fine and I used
59:21 - to teach Latin and in Latin in the the
59:25 - there's a couple of different ways you
59:26 - could pronounce Latin but in the
59:29 - pronunciation style that I used in my
59:31 - class you would pronounce an AI is e
59:34 - anyway so so that's not really that
59:38 - weird to me
59:45 - Sebastian says check out Gatsby Jas I've
59:48 - heard about Gatsby I haven't used it yet
59:50 - but it sounds really cool
59:52 - Jordan says there is a drupal plugin for
59:55 - a rest api awesome so that's cool so if
59:58 - I'll have off to remember so it
60:01 - shouldn't be too big of a deal then just
60:03 - to have this company install the plugin
60:05 - and set up a REST API if we need it
60:07 - that's awesome
60:10 - Zanna says I was on fever fiber not
60:14 - showed up for not fi ve or R for a while
60:17 - coded small small things for for peanuts
60:19 - especially CSS GS animations but I also
60:22 - learned a lot from that yeah cool I was
60:29 - on a similar site before too and that's
60:32 - kind of how it goes you don't really
60:34 - make a lot of money off the sites like
60:35 - that but you do get experience so if
60:39 - that's what you need then it's it's
60:41 - definitely I mean it's better than doing
60:44 - nothing right oh if I have says I did
60:48 - pronounce the name correctly so awesome
60:54 - Zanna said gave up on Fiverr because
61:00 - people are mostly asked me to copy
61:02 - things from other sites and didn't like
61:04 - that felt like stealing yeah that kind
61:06 - of stinks I mean I'm I'm all for getting
61:08 - inspiration from other sites but just
61:10 - straight copying I'm I don't I don't
61:14 - like that yeah I mean there's definitely
61:18 - a difference between you know learning
61:21 - from other people but and copying from
61:25 - other people
61:41 - okay Evo said in regard to the to the
61:51 - Drupal plug-in the drupal rest api
61:54 - plugin check that out didn't really have
61:55 - that much time to investigate so I mean
62:00 - I'm assuming that it works in a similar
62:02 - manner to the WordPress plug-in I mean
62:04 - at least in terms of getting the data
62:06 - you know rest the way data comes out of
62:09 - REST API is somewhat similar you know
62:11 - for most places okay Adam says thanks
62:19 - for taking time to share this
62:20 - appreciated oh I appreciate you saying
62:23 - that Thanks
62:25 - thanks for watching and contributing in
62:28 - the chat as how did you get started
62:30 - collaborating with free code camp I'd
62:32 - love to do some things with them with
62:34 - teaching angular so actually for free
62:38 - code camp stuff ayat I started live
62:40 - streaming on my own YouTube channel and
62:44 - I did a few streams and then Bo from
62:48 - free code camp who does all like the
62:50 - JavaScript tutorial stuff he I guess
62:54 - watch one of my videos so I posted in
62:57 - the free code camp forum and I just I
62:59 - wanted help for people to give me tips
63:02 - on like how to improve my stream so I
63:05 - explained what my idea was for the
63:07 - stream which was just to show people
63:08 - what my normal work day is like and I
63:11 - asked for advice and so I think he saw
63:14 - that that link in the forum watched one
63:18 - of the videos and then he asked me if
63:20 - I'd be interested in in doing some
63:23 - streams on free code camp and so I
63:26 - talked to Bo and I talked to Quincy just
63:28 - through email and I ended up doing some
63:32 - streams and they like the streams and so
63:35 - I I said well you know I'll stream here
63:38 - every day then if that's alright and
63:39 - they said yeah so so I'm streaming and I
63:42 - let them I let him know coincident
63:44 - bow-bow that if they ever don't want me
63:46 - to stream any more to please let me know
63:48 - because I want to be helpful to people
63:50 - and if I'm not helpful and I don't want
63:52 - to waste waste of time on the chain
63:54 - but evidently they must be happy with
63:56 - with the streaming I think they are
63:58 - Quincy occasionally will drop into the
64:00 - live chat and he seems to be happy with
64:02 - with what's happening and told some
64:06 - people on Twitter over the weekend that
64:07 - I was doing a good job so so that was
64:11 - that's how it happened for me I kind of
64:14 - really didn't like I didn't imagine that
64:17 - that would happen at all so it was a
64:21 - very very nice surprise and enabled me
64:23 - to basically like instantly have an
64:27 - audience of people you know because
64:29 - freak I think my youtube channel has
64:31 - less than 500 subscribers and free code
64:36 - camps over seven hundred and seventy
64:37 - thousand definitely much better
64:43 - subscriber base here all right so anyway
64:50 - Adam if you want to do things with free
64:52 - code camp then I you know just reach out
64:56 - I would say reach out to Tabo or Quincy
65:01 - or both you reach out on Twitter or in
65:05 - the in the forum probably Twitter would
65:07 - be the most direct way to reach out and
65:10 - if you have any examples of videos or
65:13 - streams that you've done already then
65:16 - that would be cool to just say the get
65:17 - this out I'm interested and just see how
65:20 - it goes from there I can't really help
65:22 - you any more than that because I don't I
65:24 - don't really have any decision-making
65:27 - power within free code camp I just you
65:30 - know I I do my my little thing you know
65:32 - and and that's it I think that's kind of
65:35 - how it works everybody that volunteers
65:37 - with free code camp just kind of does
65:38 - their own little thing to help out and
65:42 - you know there are definitely some
65:44 - people with Quincy and everything that
65:45 - have more oversight over things but it's
65:48 - very much like kind of a decentralized
65:50 - thing you know there's a ton of meetups
65:53 - all over the world and things and this
65:54 - was very very decentralized Oh aim high
65:58 - is here hey how's it going so so aim
66:02 - high recently got a job so
66:05 - how's it going so far I am actually I
66:10 - was really excited about that because
66:12 - aim high will come in from time to time
66:14 - into the live chat and and give updates
66:17 - from even like in the the job hunting
66:21 - process and then it through the
66:23 - interviews and everything and then
66:25 - getting a job so I'm really excited
66:27 - excited about it alright so I'm gonna
66:36 - get back to coding because I just spent
66:38 - a really long time in the live chat so I
66:42 - see there's a couple more things that
66:44 - were just posted in the live chat so
66:46 - I'll get back to those in a minute
66:47 - I think this is these packages have been
66:51 - up on the screen long enough so I think
66:52 - I'm probably safe too
66:54 - I guess I'll leave them up for now so I
66:57 - don't forget about configuring this
67:00 - package but for now as I said the next
67:05 - step is going to be making this work so
67:07 - when you click one of these it actually
67:08 - does filter filter this out so let's
67:14 - let's just check out some of the filters
67:17 - that we already have because this is not
67:19 - going to be very different from what
67:21 - we're already doing actually
67:33 - oh did we already set this up yeah we
67:36 - did I can't believe I forgot that yeah I
67:40 - remember this now
67:41 - yeah because someone in the live chat
67:43 - had given some some code for this and
67:46 - I'm sorry I can't remember who it was
67:48 - I'm really sorry about that I really
67:51 - usually and in somewhat decent about
67:54 - remembering who contributed so really
67:56 - sorry I can't remember who contributed
67:58 - this little bit of code it wasn't a pull
67:59 - request it was just you know copy and
68:01 - pasted into the live chat but in any
68:04 - case so we do have some filter by
68:06 - category stuff going on and then we were
68:09 - just changing the state and then that is
68:14 - what we'll filter by so I don't know if
68:16 - we actually put the filter on though
68:21 - hold on a second let me see those
68:25 - resource category
68:33 - okay sorry we actually filtering
68:42 - sure thing here sorry I'm just trying to
68:44 - figure out what we did since I didn't
68:47 - remember that we did it okay alright so
68:50 - this okay alright so this category thing
68:57 - in the state is what actually populates
68:59 - that that select that drop-down this
69:03 - category is what is gonna the filters
69:06 - gonna be based on so this is gonna
69:09 - change so it's going to be not the
69:11 - category name but the category number so
69:15 - zero is gonna give us everything so let
69:20 - me go down and so when we do filter by
69:26 - category if it's zero see we return true
69:29 - for everything otherwise we're gonna
69:34 - return so I think I have some check in
69:38 - here for undefined that our return false
69:42 - otherwise it's actually gonna take the
69:45 - the category and return things with that
69:51 - actual category so so what we need to do
69:58 - now is take that select input and we
70:07 - want to make it so that every time
70:08 - something changes with that input
70:11 - it changes States this is going to be a
70:15 - cool thing to demonstrate right because
70:18 - I don't think we've done this yet at
70:22 - least in the stream so what we're gonna
70:25 - do to this input exists in another
70:29 - component so it's not gonna be as
70:33 - straightforward as it normally is you
70:35 - know we we can't just you know call this
70:37 - function you know right here so what
70:40 - we're gonna need to do is actually we're
70:43 - gonna make a we're gonna make a function
70:48 - that sets the state to whatever the
70:50 - value is of this
70:52 - and that function is going to live here
70:53 - right because this state is needs to be
70:58 - in this component right because this
71:00 - state is gonna change things you know on
71:03 - this page so first things first let's
71:09 - let's make that but then we're going to
71:11 - pass that that function as a prop to
71:14 - here and then we can do our on change to
71:18 - get the value here and on the change
71:22 - what's going to happen is we're going to
71:25 - call that function and we're going to
71:26 - pass in the value into that function and
71:30 - that's going to make it actually run the
71:34 - function here change the state here and
71:36 - resources and then a state change is
71:39 - going to trigger a rerender and then
71:41 - that's gonna be what filters everything
71:44 - hopefully that made sense if it didn't
71:47 - make sense when I explained it it will
71:49 - probably make more sense when I actually
71:51 - do it so first thing we're gonna do
71:56 - let's put this we'll put it by the
72:00 - filter so keep them together a bit let's
72:07 - say
72:16 - set cast category
72:21 - that works alright so I'm gonna be set
72:24 - category and we're gonna pass in
72:30 - category number just can't abbreviate
72:33 - that as cat num and let's basically all
72:44 - we're gonna do then is go this set state
72:48 - and we're gonna take category and we
72:55 - want to set it equal to cat none and
73:00 - that's that's it this is going to be
73:03 - just really simple so now we need to go
73:12 - down to here we have material select so
73:17 - let's go
73:37 - okay so I think that's how we need to do
73:41 - this if this ends up not working I
73:43 - actually just did this on a project I'm
73:45 - doing for the Udacity course that I'm
73:48 - taking so I can double check it on there
73:50 - because I've had to do this a few times
73:51 - for that project but I think that's that
73:56 - should work so now this will get passed
73:58 - as a prop so in here it's gonna select
74:06 - input and actually I gotta remember how
74:10 - to get a value from a select input
74:22 - because I haven't done that in a long
74:24 - time
74:29 - so on my other screen I just looked up
74:34 - how to get the value and the first page
74:40 - I went to it's not great so let's go to
74:43 - stack overflow everybody's giving jQuery
74:50 - answers I don't want jQuery answers
75:15 - actually
75:18 - I kind of wanna see where's my select
75:22 - input
75:37 - okay the values are there it's correct
75:47 - so
75:50 - I want to select something it's that
75:52 - selected
76:10 - all right so just straight up value does
76:12 - not work I guess I will have to look it
76:18 - up I thought I might get lucky and just
76:21 - try it maybe you have to see which one
76:28 - is selected
76:45 - can't believe I'm getting stuck on
76:47 - something so simple I know I've done
76:50 - this before
76:51 - plenty of times maybe stuff okay well in
77:01 - jQuery is dot Val which is not gonna
77:04 - help me that much because I don't want
77:06 - to use jQuery let me try to find it what
77:17 - it is using just JavaScript
77:34 - it looks like it might just be valued
77:55 - hmm
78:03 - let's just try it with value then
78:18 - all right so on the select input we're
78:23 - going to do an on change and we're gonna
78:28 - say on change and
78:37 - let me see actually I really I think I
78:41 - do want to see how I did this on my
78:43 - other project so let me bring it over
78:45 - it's probably worth worth sharing so
78:52 - anyway so this is my no this isn't mine
78:54 - this is Bill's where's mine sorry bill
78:58 - if you didn't want your project on on
79:00 - YouTube I thought I had mine up
79:03 - somewhere
79:14 - all right so this is when and I'm pretty
79:22 - sure I did it with this there we go
79:28 - that's what I was I was looking for this
79:29 - syntax here okay so looking for then I
79:40 - could probably shorten this to E save a
79:44 - bit and I don't need the first part and
79:56 - when I was doing it before that was a
79:59 - stateless functional component so I need
80:00 - to add this props to this one breath
80:04 - work and what did we call it we called
80:08 - it set category all right so this cross
80:16 - target value okay so let's check it out
80:21 - we'll save that and then I'm also gonna
80:24 - add into this function a good old
80:33 - console just to see what we're getting
80:41 - in case it doesn't work we'll see what
80:43 - we're getting right away so let's test
80:49 - it out
80:51 - nothing happened all right let's see
80:53 - maybe I just didn't refresh it's
80:56 - possible with my I guess it's not hmm
81:07 - I'll show one more time
81:11 - okay so that's its not being triggered
81:15 - so our own change event is not
81:17 - triggering anything so we need actually
81:26 - let me look at this project again
81:27 - because I'm pretty sure I have a select
81:33 - drop down in the project so it says here
81:40 - I'm Bo
81:41 - yeah this is a select on change okay I
81:49 - see what's happening
82:04 - all right let's try
82:27 - chimes knocking I'm thinking
82:54 - okay this I added this in for another
82:57 - reason so this is irrelevant for what
82:59 - we're doing now so on change this should
83:07 - work let's check out how I pulled it in
83:14 - though in the main the main component
83:21 - here so I move book there we go so I
83:29 - pulled it in here so it's being pulled
83:37 - in as shelf
83:46 - yeah it looks like it's work it's
83:48 - working in here all right let's check
83:51 - out
83:52 - let's check this out again and see
83:54 - what's going on okay so and maybe it's
84:00 - just something silly like I misspelled
84:02 - something okay so we have set category
84:16 - so on change we're gonna get the value
84:22 - right
84:27 - let's
84:32 - let's just take this out for a second
84:42 - and see if we can get a console out of
84:47 - this
84:55 - nope not getting anything
85:11 - no nothing okay I'm gonna go to the live
85:14 - chat because it's possible that some of
85:16 - you have already figured out what my
85:18 - problem is and I've been foolishly
85:23 - ignoring the left all right so I'm gonna
85:27 - scroll up to about the time when I first
85:30 - started having the problem I see there's
85:37 - some questions in here I will I will
85:39 - come back and get to the questions as
85:42 - soon as we get this working
86:07 - well so I'm just kind of scanning
86:09 - through to see and someone says Jay says
86:13 - there's a grandma in Japan as 86 years
86:17 - old and learned how to develop an app
86:19 - that's awesome
86:29 - as Anna said she lived in Japan for two
86:32 - years that's awesome I would love to
86:35 - live in Japan I'm a big fan of sushi and
86:38 - ramen and it would be amazing to go
86:43 - there because there are so many places
86:45 - to get sushi and ramen where I live you
86:50 - can't buy ramen anywhere like at a
86:52 - restaurant they just don't have it I
86:55 - have to drive into Pittsburgh to find a
86:58 - ramen place and even in Pittsburgh
86:59 - there's there's not many places you can
87:01 - go to get it with sushi
87:07 - there are like two sushi restaurants
87:09 - near where I live but they're not like
87:13 - they're not really good I mean it's okay
87:16 - it doesn't taste bad but it would it
87:21 - would be cool I like the color Japanese
87:23 - culture as well there's a lot of cool
87:25 - things about it
87:50 - okay so it looks like there's a lot of
87:52 - awesome conversation going on the live
87:54 - chat but not exactly related to my
87:56 - problem so let's get back to the
88:00 - research so I'm actually gonna bring
88:02 - over I usually don't do research on this
88:03 - screen but I'm going to now so let's say
88:15 - say I want to think now if I've gotten
88:19 - the value from a select input in one of
88:24 - my previous projects aside from the one
88:29 - I just checked I think I have but let's
88:40 - see if it's all right
88:47 - cool so evidently this is Wow sorry I
88:55 - just saw this on the side here anybody
88:57 - looking for a chub seeing yourself we're
89:00 - developer 130,000 to 150,000 dollars a
89:03 - year and you can work remote that sounds
89:06 - like a great deal
89:15 - ellaby that's like so much more than I
89:18 - make right now I can't even imagine what
89:21 - that would be like
89:59 - okay let's see this said state yeah this
90:05 - is pretty much what we're doing
90:12 - we're getting the target value we have
90:17 - unchanged
90:38 - all right let me check the code again is
90:41 - it seems like we're doing what you know
90:46 - I'm doing pretty much the same thing and
90:49 - another site that I worked on earlier
90:52 - this week and it worked and it's also
90:57 - pretty much the same thing that we just
90:59 - saw in the stack overflow page there so
91:05 - what is the problem
91:25 - oh I want to check one thing where's my
91:34 - so I want to check how I pass this
91:48 - okay is this the problem in yeah I think
91:54 - this is the problem
92:12 - all right so there's definitely a
92:14 - difference in how I pass this in so
92:24 - that's that makes sense this is the only
92:25 - thing I really haven't checked over yet
92:28 - so let's find that material select so so
92:35 - I would I did that kind of fast so I'm
92:37 - not sure if anybody caught it but you'll
92:39 - see it now so basically I was just
92:41 - passing in you know this function like
92:45 - that but that isn't how I did it in my
92:48 - other project that that works so this is
92:54 - what I need to do now is get what I'm
92:59 - what I'm passing here is by a second
93:04 - call whatever I won out what was i
93:06 - calling it
93:11 - and then i call this and set category
93:24 - okay so this this makes more sense as to
93:29 - how it was working I don't know what I
93:31 - was thinking earlier so yeah so this
93:36 - will then and should work maybe I'm
93:39 - still a little worried though that even
93:43 - our console.log didn't work but let's
93:46 - take this out and that set it to what we
93:48 - had it at before and make sure I save it
93:53 - in both places and now let's give it a
93:55 - try
94:05 - okay not working let me check out I want
94:08 - to check out what state is nice and not
94:17 - showing me where status I guess I can
94:23 - check out what the props are at least
94:41 - mmm
94:47 - okay I'm gonna check the live chat again
94:51 - okay it looks like Oliver is put
94:56 - something in here this is the category
94:58 - and all of this process a category
95:00 - you've copied it's from a savings
95:01 - component oh good catch
95:07 - good catch
95:23 - I see let me see is this set category
95:27 - and not this prop set category you've
95:30 - copied from a stateless component ok
95:33 - she's saying this
95:43 - actually this should be right this
95:46 - should be this props category so the
95:47 - other the other component I use was a
95:50 - stateless functional component so it was
95:53 - just this set category but in this case
95:56 - I need to have this props correct so I
96:05 - don't think I read the comment out loud
96:07 - so sorry
96:09 - the the the comment was talking about
96:17 - the difference between using this set
96:19 - category versus this props set category
96:22 - so on my my other example here I used I
96:30 - guess I had clicked every but on my
96:31 - other example I had a stateless
96:33 - functional component so I just had to do
96:35 - props set category right yeah
97:07 - so at this point the only change that I
97:14 - can think of the alien is different
97:18 - that's really different between these
97:19 - are the fact that there's some other
97:23 - stuff going on here
97:26 - it's not just a normal select input
97:40 - so maybe what I need to look up is
97:55 - so maybe hey all right there's a github
98:02 - issue for this okay so someone else
98:08 - using the T realize wants to get the
98:12 - value
98:27 - okay but all these these examples
98:39 - using jQuery I don't want to use jQuery
98:43 - also it's it's a different
98:55 - alright I'll take one more and then
98:59 - we'll try something try a few things yes
99:05 - alright materialized CSS with react Jas
99:08 - let's see what's going on here
99:47 - okay so there was an answer but I'm not
99:52 - sure whether or not it worked it says no
99:53 - votes wasn't selected the this is pretty
99:58 - much the exact situation that we have
100:02 - but this is a little little odd so it's
100:13 - saying to put a wrapper around it all
100:18 - and then track this change event inside
100:23 - component did mount
100:36 - I don't know any any thoughts on this
100:38 - method I'm not really sure that this is
100:43 - really the best way to go I mean if it
100:45 - works it works but it seems to me like
100:49 - there's got to be a more straightforward
100:52 - way of doing it
101:01 - I'm gonna check the live chat again cuz
101:04 - I think I have asked a few questions and
101:06 - then never checked
101:36 - looks like we now have a slack channel
101:45 - that's cool so so if I have created a
101:53 - slack channel its FCC pair programming
101:57 - dot slack calm so that's pretty cool
102:02 - we also have a channel an IRC channel on
102:09 - freenode and it's hashtag FCC Jessie so
102:13 - FCC J esse so we have that actually I
102:18 - haven't logged into the channel for for
102:20 - a little while I have to remember I kind
102:22 - of forgotten to login
102:50 - okay I'm Barry toe said maybe it's time
102:55 - to restart the server so that's actually
102:59 - a good idea it has happened in the past
103:01 - that I couldn't figure out what is going
103:03 - on and then I restart the server and
103:05 - somehow it works this it's worth a shot
103:31 - oh well not working
103:57 - alright now this I'm gonna run through
104:03 - every line and I'm gonna look at every
104:06 - line and just just to say maybe that the
104:10 - weird thing is is I'm not I didn't see
104:13 - any error messages I mean any new error
104:15 - messages but let me read them okay so I
104:17 - usually get a lot having unique key prop
104:21 - okay I probably should give the key prop
104:26 - okay so this is a warning related to the
104:30 - value on the select option so it's
104:37 - possible that that is messing something
104:39 - up these are just related to using
104:45 - localhost out there so let's
105:00 - let me see this resource drive I thought
105:03 - I had added a key but I guess I didn't
105:27 - I guess I'll have to pass in I get it
105:33 - doesn't really matter there's no way
105:34 - that that is messing up what I'm doing
105:36 - now but I wouldn't need to put a key a
105:38 - unique key on there and I'll just use
105:40 - the ID the WordPress ID but for now
105:46 - let's check this out again so
105:57 - let me look
106:22 - the I guess I could test and see if
106:25 - something is messing it up because we're
106:28 - changing it with jQuery so I could stop
106:32 - initializing it and then let's refresh
106:41 - so it's gonna be invisible for now so
106:44 - I'm gonna have to change it manually so
106:53 - this select is gonna set the
106:56 - display:none so we'll just kind of
106:58 - manually get rid of that
106:59 - we'll check out okay so it's still not
107:06 - happening so it's probably not due to to
107:11 - what's going on since it's still not
107:13 - working the other thing I can check out
107:18 - is the actual data
107:20 - [Music]
107:34 - see the key value
108:07 - let me remove this because we were
108:11 - getting in a a warning related to that
108:17 - and we could
108:25 - so let me initialize this again
108:40 - okay so didn't do anything except to
108:44 - change so that choose the categories and
108:46 - displayed right away hmm
108:57 - look at this again
109:38 - yes
109:42 - Wow I'm really surprised I didn't think
109:45 - it was going to be this difficult to
109:47 - just get the value from this
110:02 - let me check out okay so patrick has
110:11 - pasted in a link to a github issue so
110:20 - let's see
110:28 - go check it out
110:39 - I'm I'll bring it over
110:48 - so
110:55 - okay cool so this is the on change event
110:58 - for select is not propagated yeah this
111:01 - actually thanks Patrick
111:04 - this seems like this could be exactly
111:07 - our problem is that nothing's happening
111:10 - for that on change event even when we
111:13 - just wanted a simple console.log we
111:14 - didn't get anything so this is probably
111:18 - what's happening here is the the on
111:21 - change event is not it's not find others
111:25 - it's probably firing but it's just not
111:26 - registering at all alright so I do want
111:32 - to check out I'll change this okay let's
111:41 - go down a bit then to this it's always
111:47 - good when you go through an issue in
111:48 - github whichever one has the most cool
111:52 - emojis is probably the best answer if
111:57 - you only remember one thing from today's
111:59 - stream remember that just look for all
112:01 - the emojis
112:16 - okay well let's try it this is actually
112:20 - somewhat similar to that other
112:23 - stackoverflow thing that I saw it was
112:25 - using component did mount so
112:38 - just gonna scroll through really quick
112:40 - to see if there's something with even
112:41 - more emojis okay the only thing I don't
112:50 - like about this still using jQuery
113:19 - wait a second
113:52 - okay so anyway I read this in which it
113:55 - seems like this is similar to what
113:57 - they're saying is basically like a
114:01 - container around it should work
114:36 - so I guess
114:47 - I guess we could we can at least test it
114:53 - out to see if it would work so the first
114:59 - thing I'm going to test out basically I
115:03 - know the same put it in a component did
115:04 - mount and then binding this but based on
115:09 - the other thing that I read I'm it's
115:12 - possible that if we wrap this in a div
115:18 - that we could get an event to fire based
115:24 - on that that div unless I'm reading this
115:27 - wrong which is possible because at this
115:31 - point it's starting to get a bit
115:34 - frustrating okay yeah that seems like
115:42 - what it's saying
115:59 - so this is just going to be really
116:01 - simple for now just seeing if I can get
116:07 - an event to fire
116:26 - Hey
116:31 - we get to fire once okay so we got one
116:36 - change what we get do we get another one
116:39 - let's see no we just got one but yep one
116:47 - change come on
116:52 - all right so that's not gonna help us
117:14 - okay let me I'm gonna check the lap chat
117:16 - again cuz now I'm starting to see some
117:19 - other things here set the value on the
117:23 - Select element T Anderson's has set the
117:32 - value
118:01 - and see
118:05 - oh yeah Patrick says I can just replace
118:08 - the jQuery with the document get element
118:10 - by ID yeah that's that's true resin
118:17 - wants someone to say hi hi Reza
118:36 - okay and Oliver says try just simply
118:40 - passing the function name this props a
118:42 - category changes yeah
119:10 - actually I kind of want to try this now
119:12 - because I don't think we ever tried it
119:14 - with just the console long and nothing
119:17 - else see if we can get a get a response
119:29 - okay
119:36 - once again we're just getting one
119:44 - shoot
119:52 - looks like we've gotten one too
120:00 - so again too sweet
120:17 - hey Fabien sir how's it goin Fabian all
120:25 - right I will have to see ya whether or
120:30 - not we get it working I'll have to stop
120:33 - with the coding and do some
120:34 - question-and-answer here and maybe I
120:37 - don't like 15 minutes so we'll try and
120:41 - get this working so anyway so let me let
120:45 - me just go back to the the github issue
120:54 - on react and let's just try try some of
120:59 - this stuff
121:13 - okay uh
121:14 - [Music]
121:46 - I see that's a good answer just youth
121:49 - use a different thing looks like the
121:54 - link does not work
122:09 - I was just looking I was wondering what
122:13 - because obviously we're not using a
122:16 - function name handle select change
122:56 - okay yeah I'm doing all right baby and
123:00 - I'm just stuck on something that should
123:02 - be easy and in fact something that I
123:05 - have working on another site that I got
123:09 - working just a few days ago and for some
123:11 - reason it's not working here
123:14 - [Music]
123:23 - all right so let's
123:57 - yeah let me I want to go back to what we
124:01 - had before I've changed a lot of stuff
124:05 - so I'm gonna start just want to start
124:10 - from the beginning of where we had it
124:17 - oops I don't want to get that far back
124:22 - okay alright so this is what we
124:26 - initially started with okay
124:41 - and see
125:12 - yeah Patrick says men should the the on
125:16 - change didn't even fire at all was just
125:17 - calling it console logon load yeah so
125:20 - that it wasn't really wasn't really
125:25 - helping so it was probably we was
125:29 - probably calling it twice because what's
125:31 - the data came in and everything
125:36 - rear-ended then it got caught again okay
125:45 - so we're gonna try Patrick's advices
125:48 - let's replace replace the dis props with
125:56 - console.log e
126:05 - and see what's going on okay we'll see I
126:09 - may not since it wasn't even firing I'm
126:15 - not even sure what we're gonna get let
126:21 - me refresh
126:31 - and let's change
126:35 - no not getting anything
126:48 - dang it I accidentally clicked on a link
127:06 - now my my dev server is frozen
127:17 - okay and I actually well I had to remove
127:22 - that earlier than it came back when we
127:24 - went back everything so
127:37 - okay so let's check out its inspect it
127:56 - all right I got it
127:58 - I gotta get go out in the hallway for a
128:00 - second
128:39 - so just give me an update
128:43 - I'm sorry many people yeah there's
128:45 - definitely a chunk of it that I couldn't
128:48 - eat off and everything would still look
128:50 - like it's finished so if I have to write
128:53 - yeah just make sure I want to make sure
128:55 - you are aware of that because the 17th
128:57 - possible starts and I don't know what
128:59 - they're going to be doing there show and
129:01 - tell but I know that they are so
129:03 - whatever you don't
129:04 - then you got two days when you get back
129:06 - to see what you can publish so the main
129:09 - thing is
129:15 - it'll be I have things sorted out so
129:18 - like here
129:24 - it's okay I just want to remind you
129:51 - like I just did the exact same thing a
129:53 - few days ago okay
130:19 - sorry for the interruption there but
130:23 - that was the head of my department so
130:26 - kind of had to take that because that
130:28 - was my my boss's boss's boss so I really
130:32 - couldn't leave her waiting and she was
130:36 - actually asking about the site that I'm
130:37 - working on right now and reminding me
130:41 - that once the 20th comes I am done with
130:44 - his site no matter what so to make sure
130:47 - that whatever state it's in on the 20th
130:50 - is is reasonable and you know it'll look
130:54 - like it's a finished site which I don't
130:56 - think she'd be a problem it looks like
130:57 - it's a finished site right now at least
130:59 - the version that's live so if I have to
131:04 - leave something off I'll probably leave
131:06 - off the the news section that's supposed
131:08 - to function like a blog because right
131:11 - now there's not really a lot of content
131:13 - and so that's probably the section
131:17 - that's the least amount of content so it
131:19 - would I guess be okay if we left it off
131:21 - so anyway I'm gonna check the live chat
131:23 - quickly just to see what I missed for
131:25 - the few minutes that I was gone and
131:51 - okay looks like I didn't really miss
131:53 - there was some conversation but not
131:55 - directly related to our issue tell you
132:03 - what here's what I'm gonna do it
132:07 - occurred to me that this is actually
132:09 - kind of like really weird so our issue
132:18 - was related to this being materialized
132:23 - framework right I mean that's what we
132:25 - were thinking and that's what we're
132:26 - looking at but when I didn't initialize
132:29 - it as a materialized input we still had
132:33 - an issue so if that's the case then
132:37 - maybe the issue is not maybe there's a
132:39 - like two issues potentially maybe
132:42 - there's another issue so I'm gonna try
132:43 - this again let's do this
132:46 - and let me remove this class of input
132:51 - field because it's possible that
132:54 - materialized is picking up on that class
132:58 - our options I think everything else was
133:03 - fine and let's try this out now and see
133:10 - if we get anything the only other thing
133:14 - I could think of is potentially it's a
133:17 - problem that all of these options are
133:21 - being added in after the fact and we
133:25 - could certainly test that out easily by
133:28 - hard-coding some options and seeing if
133:31 - that's if that's the case if it is the
133:36 - case all these options then maybe we
133:37 - have to put something to fix that in
133:40 - component it update but for now let's
133:43 - just try this
133:48 - now it shouldn't have done that it
133:50 - should have there we go
133:53 - actually let me put
134:04 - oops I need to so since materialized by
134:08 - default puts display:none on select
134:10 - inputs I'm gonna display block and then
134:19 - that way I don't have to keep building
134:20 - that all right so here's display let's
134:24 - change it up and see alright so let me
134:30 - bring this over so we have and I've so
134:41 - much stuff let me do this again so we
134:43 - can just get a more clean looking setup
134:47 - here okay so look we've gotten something
134:52 - right
135:01 - which is better than what we had before
135:04 - if if it comes down to it I'm fine with
135:08 - just doing a bit of styling on this I'm
135:12 - not I'm not tied down to using the
135:15 - materialized input I've actually I've
135:18 - been unable to use the material i style
135:20 - input on a few other projects that I had
135:22 - and I've been able to style it in such a
135:26 - way that it looks decent not quite as
135:30 - polished there's the materialized input
135:32 - so that's that's fine then we can I can
135:43 - definitely change it also
135:51 - I'm wondering if
135:58 - so basically what's happening is on this
136:01 - select input materialised it's just
136:03 - changing what you see into a list right
136:07 - and then making that list behave
136:10 - basically I could drop down potentially
136:13 - if you wanted to keep that same style
136:14 - all we would have to do is instead of
136:17 - having a select input we just made a
136:20 - list and just had click and it looks
136:23 - like you know when you clicked on a
136:25 - certain thing on the list then it it
136:28 - updated I'd rather not have to go
136:31 - through all that but those are two
136:32 - alternatives that I'm thinking of to
136:35 - just completely bypass all of this stuff
136:37 - so at this point I'm I'm convinced now
136:41 - upon seeing that
136:51 - upon saying that this actually is
136:54 - working when I have materialized
137:01 - disabled then it's definitely
137:05 - materialized ok see and then we got a
137:08 - value so we got the value we want so
137:11 - here's what I'm going to do I'm gonna
137:14 - put back in here what we were originally
137:16 - going to have which I guess was let's
137:29 - just go back to get what we had before
137:39 - okay so that's what we have before and
137:41 - then I'm just gonna add this one again
137:43 - I'm gonna take this out and leave that
137:49 - off just for now I'll probably just
137:51 - completely remove everything but when we
137:54 - do this hopefully we'll get we can get
137:59 - the filtering working and check oh what
138:01 - just happened
138:13 - they are reps oops
138:20 - wait a second so I
138:27 - oops left off a bracket there we go okay
138:33 - so let's try it now
138:48 - come on she's too
138:55 - oh yes it's actually not shoot
139:15 - it's still--it's console logging and we
139:17 - got rid of our console log right we
139:20 - still eat that one in here
139:37 - you know what we might not actually be
139:39 - using this filter off the check so this
139:43 - must be the console oh that's actually
139:45 - working resources yeah so it's coming
139:49 - from the resource page so that's the
139:52 - console log it's working it should be
139:54 - setting the state correctly let's go
140:01 - down to where our filters are
140:13 - okay yeah maybe we don't have a filter
140:15 - for that so
140:25 - let's do that
140:34 - I don't want to filter
140:43 - so I'm gonna filter and actually what it
140:58 - sorry I forgot what I called that
141:16 - actually I had the price that where did
141:18 - I put the price filter in sorry
141:23 - gonna figure this out
141:29 - what the heck
141:42 - so my price filter is not working either
141:45 - I had the price filter working before -
141:49 - what did I do
142:03 - that's really odd okay
142:06 - [Music]
142:15 - filter by category I need to put in I
142:20 - think that's how I do it
142:28 - I had all my my windows hurt out of the
142:32 - order I want them to be in there we go
142:36 - just don't know what I called it I hope
142:40 - bunny did it it needs to be this sorry
142:43 - about that
142:45 - this dots
143:17 - all right
143:23 - it did something not exactly I wanted it
143:47 - something happen
143:56 - oh that not exactly what we wanted but
144:01 - it's better than nothing
144:26 - okay I think I'm just gonna have to stop
144:32 - for now and figure this out tomorrow
144:36 - because I do have an appointment at 5:00
144:39 - that I'll have to leave for soon and I
144:43 - want to get to your questions so just to
144:48 - try to wrap up somewhat as much as I can
144:50 - here the plan is basically to not use
144:54 - the material as input and instead just
144:56 - to style the input a bit so that it
145:01 - looks it looks good
145:03 - as good as you can or potentially make
145:06 - some type of custom drop-down thing and
145:09 - then it would it would look similar to
145:14 - this input but would in fact be a list
145:19 - also figure out what's going on with
145:24 - this filtering it's obviously it's doing
145:26 - something but not exactly what we wanted
145:29 - to do so I'll just have to go through
145:31 - and try some things out I'm gonna think
145:38 - what else
145:41 - that's about it I mean probably if I can
145:46 - get that done
145:49 - the search works these work so basically
145:55 - just getting these two done it'll be
145:58 - functional completely functional in
146:01 - terms of what we want it to do could
146:04 - probably use a bit of polishing up the
146:06 - UI but it'll do what we want it to do so
146:11 - this is really close to being
146:12 - functionally ready so I'll need to check
146:18 - I also want to check to make sure that
146:22 - the posts actually are linked up with
146:25 - the categories I expect that they are
146:28 - but I just want to double check it's not
146:30 - that because if it's the case that we
146:32 - have categories but they're not linked
146:33 - to posts then that would explain why
146:35 - we're getting nothing here it wouldn't
146:37 - explain why they're not showing back up
146:39 - when I click all but anyway so that's
146:43 - the plan
146:44 - so I'll fairly work on that tomorrow or
146:47 - maybe tonight I'm kind of thinking I'm
146:49 - gonna have to put in some work on this
146:51 - at night to get it to where it needs to
146:53 - be anyway so let me go back I'm gonna go
147:00 - back to the lodge that I know there's a
147:02 - ton of stuff in here so I'm gonna try to
147:09 - get through as much as I can before I
147:11 - have to leave
147:20 - so if you do have a question you could
147:22 - put it in there now I'll try to get to
147:25 - it if I happen to not get to it you can
147:28 - message me on Twitter the links in the
147:31 - description or you can put it in the
147:35 - comments for this video or you could
147:40 - just wait til tomorrow and ask me then
147:55 - okay I'm scrolling through these I'm
147:59 - going pretty quick so I can get to the
148:01 - question so it's possible I might miss a
148:04 - question so I'm sorry if I miss miss any
148:12 - questions
148:21 - okay suit sumit had a question about a
148:26 - contact list in an app the web app that
148:30 - they're building so I'm not sure it
148:36 - wasn't us assume it if you're still here
148:40 - you're still listening
148:41 - I need a bit more info if you want to
148:44 - send me a link if you have liked your
148:47 - project on github or something then I
148:49 - could check it out but I'm not sure I
148:52 - could give you a good answer you know
148:54 - just from you know the info that that
148:56 - could be put in and the live chat it
148:58 - pretty better if I could see the code so
149:00 - you can message me direct message me on
149:03 - Twitter and I'll get I'll check it out
149:12 - okay cool Gino says I've signed up today
149:15 - I assume sign up for a free code camp
149:17 - and in two hours I finished the HTML and
149:20 - CSS tomorrow bootstrap King that's
149:22 - awesome
149:24 - that's really cool
149:32 - all right so aim high yeah sorry I asked
149:36 - you a question about your job and then I
149:38 - I got sidetracked with with the the
149:40 - coding and so I didn't read your answers
149:43 - I'm sorry about that but here's the
149:44 - answer so aim high got a job recently
149:47 - and we're all really excited so it says
149:52 - first week has been brilliant working on
149:55 - a project with 30 million users every
149:57 - month team of four developers that's
149:59 - awesome that's that's really really cool
150:03 - yeah congratulations on that name House
150:08 - is loving it so really happy for you
150:12 - that sounds great thirty million users a
150:15 - month that's a lot that's that's amazing
150:29 - Janus is FF developer IDI edited on good
150:34 - for coding I'm not I'm not really sure
150:35 - what that is so I'm sorry I'm saying if
150:41 - you're still around you could explain a
150:43 - bit more I'm just not understanding the
150:46 - question do you know ask what do I need
150:51 - to learn to be a front-end web dev if
150:53 - you're already going through the free
150:55 - code camp stuff if you just keep going
150:58 - through the free code camp front-end
150:59 - thing that'll teach you a lot I
151:02 - definitely work on some projects you
151:05 - know as you pick up skills because
151:07 - you'll need you know you'll need to know
151:09 - how to do your own projects and setup
151:11 - things like that so I would for now at
151:15 - least be starting out you know free code
151:17 - camp will be a great start for you and
151:19 - that's aim high gave similar advice also
151:25 - a nice says go on to dribble and try to
151:28 - convert complex designs into code using
151:31 - HTML CSS that's really good advice I
151:33 - like that
151:41 - Oh John John said Google developer tools
151:47 - has a way to see all unused CSS rules in
151:49 - each page makes it quick to find this
151:51 - content cool yeah I actually I used that
151:53 - when it was on Chrome Canary and it was
151:59 - really cool at that point I don't think
152:02 - it was ready but now it's it's in chrome
152:05 - like the the normal version of Chrome so
152:08 - I have to use it
152:09 - haven't used in a while but that's a
152:11 - that's a great idea
152:21 - Eva said just heads up that chrome tool
152:25 - is did cause cause some trouble before
152:28 - searching for it
152:40 - all right so I'm gonna skip I gotta go
152:43 - in just a few minutes so I'm gonna
152:45 - unfortunately I'm gonna have to skip a
152:46 - lot of just like the comments in the
152:48 - live chat but I will be able to
152:50 - hopefully answer any questions
153:15 - okay Sebastian has a question about an
153:17 - app that he's building about updating
153:22 - state so Sebastian if you want to send
153:25 - me a link if you have it on github and
153:27 - can share I'd be happy to check it out
153:42 - Gino asks what types of code I need to
153:45 - learn to be front-end web dev got some
153:47 - answers in live chat which are good but
153:50 - just for everyone else that's watching
153:52 - that maybe you can't see the live chat
153:54 - if you're watching later on HTML CSS
153:59 - JavaScript if you only learn those you
154:04 - can build web apps front-end and
154:07 - back-end if you want to branch out and
154:09 - you know what you want the specifically
154:11 - like you could pick up PHP if you know
154:14 - if that's where you want to go into
154:16 - WordPress is built with PHP Drupal
154:18 - Joomla so it kind of depends on where
154:23 - you want to go but if you're not sure
154:25 - what exactly you want to do yet within
154:27 - front-end web development and I should
154:30 - say if you want to just just stick the
154:32 - front-end you really don't need a
154:33 - back-end language like PHP but HTML CSS
154:39 - javascript is you you'll be solid if you
154:43 - really focus on that
155:16 - okay
155:20 - we had some discussions about languages
155:24 - and different things to learn
155:36 - Sebastian said he had to go like an hour
155:41 - ago so he didn't hear any of my
155:43 - responses so maybe he'll be able to
155:45 - catch the the recording if I have asked
155:53 - this free code camp have back-end dev
155:55 - streams actually right now I think I'm
155:57 - the only live coding stream on free code
155:59 - camp but we might get some some new
156:01 - people we're talking on Twitter so I can
156:04 - set up Twitter with a few other people
156:05 - who are interested and maybe like being
156:09 - on this stream and like adding some
156:11 - commentary and talking and then Quincy
156:16 - joined in and offered to say you know
156:21 - they could they could come on and
156:22 - actually do their own stream if they
156:24 - wanted to so that's possible I don't
156:26 - know nothing's been said officially yet
156:29 - but it's possible that could be coming
156:44 - mrs. hoese Anna's comment sushi is
156:47 - nowhere quite like in Japan yeah that's
156:50 - what I've heard
156:52 - I'd really love like a while back I was
156:56 - talking about sushi so it's in it was in
157:01 - response to that now I really want some
157:04 - sushi you know I'm thinking about it
157:26 - all right almost to the bottom of the
157:29 - live chat it's not not a really a whole
157:35 - lot of questions today a lot of activity
157:37 - in the chat which is awesome
157:41 - oh yes the question says almost everyone
157:47 - can learn front-end development for free
157:50 - what do you think will web developing
157:53 - sphere become overcrowded Zanna says no
157:58 - there'll be more jobs than coders that's
158:01 - yeah there's definitely way more jobs
158:03 - than coders right now and it doesn't
158:04 - look like that's gonna change anytime
158:06 - soon so I wouldn't worry about that
158:08 - because you can learn to code for free
158:10 - but that it doesn't guarantee that
158:12 - there's quality coders you know you know
158:17 - people who are really dedicated and and
158:19 - you know work hard at it will be the
158:22 - good ones and get the jobs and the so I
158:24 - think in terms of to me I think it's
158:29 - more important to think of like people
158:30 - who are quality coders who really can do
158:33 - the jobs not just necessarily people who
158:36 - say hey it's free to learn how to code I
158:38 - can learn be you know because as long as
158:41 - as long as there's a shortage of quality
158:44 - coders who really know what they're
158:46 - doing they'll always be jobs out there
158:49 - because you know just because you can go
158:52 - out for free and learn what to do you
158:55 - won't necessarily get a job unless you
158:56 - actually are decent so in that sense you
159:01 - know I don't think the markets gonna get
159:03 - flooded with with so many coders just
159:05 - because it's free to learn and Jeremy
159:09 - says in LA I mean Los Angeles there's
159:13 - plenty of companies looking for
159:15 - front-end as cool
159:25 - all cool and rejoining hander
159:36 - Oh Andrew be balanced is working great
159:38 - thanks so much
159:40 - I am I talked about it at the beginning
159:43 - of the show like super helpful it was
159:47 - really impressed with that cool Andrew
159:53 - says but too big react Redux courses
159:56 - from udemy for twenty dollars so that's
160:00 - a great day that's cool
160:01 - keep keep us updated on how the courses
160:04 - are and if they're good then you know
160:07 - let us know this might be a good good
160:10 - investment for learning reacts okay cool
160:17 - so I've gotten to the end of the live
160:20 - chat and unfortunately I have to go but
160:24 - I hate to leave this unfinished and I
160:28 - know I did skip over a lot of good
160:30 - conversation in the chat but I'll be
160:33 - back tomorrow and hopefully this problem
160:36 - will be solved by the time I stream
160:38 - tomorrow and I'll I'll let you know how
160:41 - it went and how I ended up solving it
160:43 - and so I guess you have probably same
160:47 - time tomorrow I don't think I have any
160:48 - meetings or anything thanks so much for
160:51 - all your help in the chat today and for
160:53 - for helping so many people who you know
160:56 - came in newer people who had questions
160:58 - they're just so much good advice and I
161:00 - really really appreciate that also
161:03 - thanks for creating the slack Channel so
161:06 - that's cool yeah if somebody yeah off to
161:10 - remember to put a check out the slack
161:12 - Channel and put a link in it's FCC pair
161:15 - programming slack com
161:17 - so if if you're interested check that
161:21 - out but I'm gonna I gotta go now
161:25 - I got a hurry up and go to my
161:27 - appointment and thunderstorm outside so

161:32 - and anyway I'll see everyone tomorrow
161:36 - and have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody is Jessie and today I wasn't exactly sure what I'd be doing so that's why that's the title for this one is purposely vague right now I'm working on the the resources page and on the the new user interface for that page and I was actually just adding an atom package to to help with my code formatting so we talked about this yesterday I think Sebastian brought it up and I have it on my laptop but I'm gonna install it now so today it'll just be like maybe just some random things I'm getting to the end of the list here so let me show you so I showed you yesterday how much was left that I needed to get done basically most of it needs to get done be done this week I have maybe a day or two next week I think that I can work on this but it needs to be done but I was able to complete a few of them but then go through this and I moved I moved to bunch them up over here into this category so that if time allows I will do it so we'll see if I can get through this then maybe I'll do some of these but after I read through them again I realized you know some of them weren't they weren't as necessary as I thought they were when I first when I first put them in these rows so for at least for now we're gonna start out working on the UI which is already taking me longer than I thought it would take in particular right now I'm having this this problem so I have this dropdown and this uses a little bit of JavaScript some jQuery from the materialized framework so it needs to be initialized to be able to do this but what's happening is it's getting initialized before the data is populating so I need to figure I need to figure out a way to stop that from happening so I'm double checking right now that I actually have yeah so let me let me pull this over on to my others from my other screen just to show you kind of in the code what's going on make it a bit bigger it's too big okay so you see we have here's our all our data is coming in with our categories for resources so the people in charge of putting in the data which actually I think it's just one person right now is in charge of putting in data in in WordPress have evidently been putting in some categories which is awesome it gives us more data to work with so they're here they're getting put in here but you can see when this gets initialized what the user sees is you know this list but all that's in this list is the first option because that's hardcoded in there so I need to initialize it afterwards so I'm thinking maybe there's some lifecycle method in react that could help out with this so right now I've made a component for this select thing because I'll probably reuse this on other pages probably the blog page possibly the events page so I thought it'd be better just to pull this out into a component so within the component I put in component amount to initialize that select input so I'm thinking maybe I'll have have to find a different life cycle method and if you're not familiar with react that simply means like component did mount is a life cycle method is it's something that happens during a certain part of the life cycle like the life of a component so when a component is going to mount when it actually did mount when it's going to to update so there are a bunch of them until maybe we'll have to go to the react Docs and check out some other ones and try out and see if we can if we can get this working so other than that I had some pull requests so let me show you the new stuff had some good stuff in here let me find it I thought I had it ready but maybe I maybe I didn't yeah I must have navigated away from the page so I'll just bring this over so this will show one of the pull requests that I haven't brought in yet let me go hey everyone okay I just saw on the live staff and they said that he has a pull request so yeah it's it's we're gonna we're gonna check it out right now so this is Vinay's request which is pretty awesome so I have I pulled down the branch to my local machine and tested it out and it's working great I just haven't merged it in yet so basically what would Vinay's done and since since he's in the live chat he could explain it more in the live chat as well and if I mess something up explaining it he can correct me but basically he switched to using preact which is a smaller version of react right so he switched to that and it makes that everything smaller I'll just I'll show you and you can check it out as well this is on the repo but let me let me show you some of the things so you can see the bundle has gone from 271 kilobytes down to 143 so it's pretty a significant drop you know percentagewise and the size so that's really cool also he added this this analyze command here that will basically bring up a page like this and it shows you all the dependencies everything is going on in your build so it's really really cool and I was actually able to see I wonder if you can see it on here I don't know I thought when I ran it anyway there were some things that I'm not using in the newer versions that of the resource page like masonry that were in here that I could see that now will be gone so it's just kind of cool that I get a visual of everything that's going into the project and be able to see the size I was kind of surprised how you know some pages are bigger than others and trying to figure out why so really cool so you can if anybody wants to to check it out and try this or anything the the pool request is is here you know you can pull that down if you want I will be merging this in probably later on either later on today or tomorrow morning I'll be pulling that in I did want to ask this so I've never used pre X so I want to ask if if anybody has used pre X I'd like to know what your thoughts are on it did you have any issues with it so so far our testing it out just locally click like everything works there's no errors or anything happening so then they did a great job but since I've never used it before I just wondered you know should I be looking out for something I read through the docs a bit just to familiarize myself with it a little more but I'm I'd really like to hear your opinion on it you know so anybody that's used it please let me know if there's if there's no objections that I'm definitely gonna you know merge that in and use it so let me show you I had another request to and yesterday I talked about that Andrew had submitted a pull request based on on the search and then he also had some comments on how to make it even better so he actually went I opened up an issue and then he went and made a pull request that that did everything that he had recommended so really awesome so it looks like I mean it seems like he put in some time to this you know based on what always was changed and everything so he pulled in the debounce from lodash and used that so you can check out the code is all on the resources page now so you'll kind of see it as we're going through because we're going to be in the resources page and you can you know might go through it briefly just to see what was done but if you want to check it out in more depth this is actually on it's merged into the master branch now so you can see it in action I haven't pushed anything from master up to the live site yet so you can see it on github but you won't be able to actually use it unless I mean unless you wanted to download the whole repository and run it locally but I will be pushing things up yeah either later today or tomorrow so anyway Andrew thank you so much this was awesome and I really liked reading through the code both from Andrew and Vinay and just learning from what you both did so both of you thank you this was really awesome and I guess I'll show also the contributors page I actually like have this up on the screen just every time I start just so that you know like you're gonna get up there I guess if I started getting a ton of contributors they wouldn't fit on the screen but for now it's nice if I get any more it's gonna be a little tight maybe two more could fit but anyway I just want to make sure that you get the recognition you deserve for helping out so that's why I show this so let's I'm just going to jump right back in where I where I was before I started this dream and just continue on oh I got a few questions let me let me go over a couple of questions first in the live chat I mean it's just maybe two of them so Josh asked how to set up the night theme on github okay so I had a lot of questions about this yesterday so let me show you basically you need two things you need tampermonkey which is a plugin for Chrome so in the in the chrome I don't know if it's called a chrome store or I don't know what they call it but where you normally get chrome plugins from get tampermonkey then once you have tampermonkey you want to get the github dark and i'll copy let's see let me get the URL and I'll just put it in the chat alright it looks like the update URL on the download URL is the same thing so this URL is where you should be able to download this code so you'll want to run this in tampermonkey and then enable it for github which I think it's all setup for I don't think you really have to setup anything else except just put this code into tampermonkey so that's basically it you may have to if you don't know how to use tampermonkey you may have to mess around with it for a bit but it's really not hard I think it's it's pretty straightforward it's basically just a place where you can put JavaScript and have it run when you go to a certain site automatically so you put it in the JavaScript and you say which site to run it on and it runs really straightforward and then once you have it on there you you have this new Settings panel this github dark Settings panel and you could do you could change everything you could customize it you could even go into the code and make your own theme if you wanted to I just use the default theme that came with it I haven't even looked at any of the other themes yet but I guess it would be cool to match match it up to the theme that I use in my code editors so the highlighting would be the same but for now I'm happy with it how it is ok the other question I had was let's see I lost it no okay Adam so Adam asks did you graduate from fus which is Franciscan University of student Moodle so that's that's the university that I work for so no I actually didn't graduate from fus so I went to actually the cheapest college in the state of West Virginia and if you're not familiar with West Virginia it's one of the poorest states in the United States of America so obviously the United States of America in terms of you know average income it's higher than a lot of other places so when I say poorest states it's relative to the United States which basically means to be considered poor in the United States you know by government standards you can still have a house and a car and cable television and Internet and so it's not really like you're you're destitute but basically the school I went to was so cheap I think I only ended up paying like four hundred dollars or something to go there after you took into account like scholarships and I did get student loan money and things but I ended up investing my student loan money since I didn't need to use it I guess I needed to buy books oh I take that I did have to pay for my book so that that cost a little bit more but I ended up making seven hundred dollars off of investing my student loan money and then whenever I was done with school I just paid it back immediately before I had to start paying interest so so everybody is always talking about how much school cost but I think I actually made money off of college so I was I was a business major and I was wanted to be a stockbroker so that was very in line with what I wanted to do but anyway the Franciscan University is quite a bit more expensive than the university I went to which was West Liberty State College it's West Liberty University now they changed the name but when I went there was just State State College but anyway Franciscan University is is not like one of the most expensive colleges out there it's it's pretty affordable for what it is but it is a private a small private college so small private colleges usually are more expensive so anyways sorry for all that none of that really had anything to do with code but and it was a long answer to a simple question but I just always like to tell the story about me making money off of off of college of my college loans back then the interest rates were a lot higher so you could you could make more money off of really safe investments and something like money market funds and stuff at high high interest rates let's seeoh ahead here we go right off the bat we have a question about the text the text out of the code editor so Sebastian says Windows notepad for the win I actually used no pen to start learning how to how to code so that was the first thing I learned out of code on back in I think like 2003 maybe 2002 somewhere around there so something like somewhere around there I think I learned on notepad which was was super fun so it's somewhat sarcastic it was fun to learn how to do it but doing it on notepad was not fun anyway I'll keep it short in terms of talking about the editors and you all can talk about as much as you on the live chat I like Adam because I've been using at them and I have a lot of packages set up and Adam a lot of plugins but I also use Visual Studio code occasionally and I will say it seems faster than Adam so one day maybe I'll switch if I ever take the time to set up you know similar packages in Visual Studio code but those are the only ones I really have very much experience with I did use notepad plus plus when I was developing on a Windows computer before I switch I switched from notepad plus plus to Adam like years ago so no plaid plus plus was okay at the time I wouldn't have said I was a serious developer at that point so it it worked but I thought it would never go back to it okay so let me let me get back and do some coding and then I'll check back in in the in the live chat and so if you've asked a question stick around for a couple minutes and I'll check back in but I'd like to try to do keep a nice balance between coding and and the chat if I can all right so the problem the problem right now is how do we get this to initialize after the data's come in and the potential solution is let's look up life cycle methods for react components I guess I'll go the official Doc's are probably a good place to go so let me make this bigger and I could probably make this a little bit bigger on the screen okay so we're already using component did mount and obviously that's not working for us right now so any lifecycle methods that happen before that are not going to be of any use to us so maybe maybe component did update the other thing is is this says when it's when it's being rerendered it's possible that this will always fire since we're making an API call to get the data for that so that might work it's worth a try so which I component did update and let's check out see what's going on oh hey it worked they're awesome I want to do do two things I want to try a full refresh and then I want to try to you know do click on these links to do that clientside routing and make sure it still works so let's go to events and then we'll come back all right that works awesome so here's a good tip I've had for some reason I've had a few questions about using jQuery with react so I had a discussion on Twitter about it recently and in a live chat I've had some comments about it we did a stream about it before but this is some good advice so if you need a component to have some data that you're waiting on first and then initialize it component did update seems like it's the way to go all right so that's all that and that was a much faster fix I'm so glad that's something that I've fixed more quickly than I thought usually it's the other way I think something's gonna be easy and then end up spending an hour on it but the next thing is I don't really want to keep this with the discolor that's not it's not the color so I got to decide what color I want to make this do I want to keep it white or not and then what color text I know this background is black but I really I don't want to make this black I'm not even sure that I want to keep this black for now anyway but I'm not gonna mess with it right now at the very least I'll change these colors to this red color that we're using for lengths here and I think I'll just leave it at that for now and if I get any ideas on something else I think that should be okay I wonder how many categories they're gonna add in here I was just saying this this may end up becoming quite large which I mean I guess that's if that's what they want to do that's fine might be difficult to scroll through everything at least it's in alphabetical order so that should help get through it so I'm going to grab the the hex color for this and then apply it here I'm gonna check out in dev tools quickly what that color what that color is where I need to put it where is this I think that it's not try this again there we go that's what I wanted okay so here's what we want the span inside the Li so looks like the dropdown content will change the color here so let me just grab this let me see my component yeah I'm gonna I was I'm glad this happened because I I've discovered something else that doesn't work when I'm using jQuery okay so on some of my components you can see that I've used like this CSS you know right here either in a style tag or you know directly in line so when I'm using these things from the materialized framework that use jQuery to manipulate the Dom which really I just don't have time to rewrite them in a better way for react but let me see basically what's gonna happen is I can't put it in line because that I mean you can see here that list all those outlines don't even exist those get added in when it's initialized I can't put it in that style JSX tag because what that ends up doing see if we can find something okay so what ends up happening is like here it's given this data JSX number and that's what's used see if I can find a style for this okay so that's what's used for these Styles so if you could see over here the stuff in the style JSX tag and the component ends up being converted into something like this where it uses these IDs well what'll happen is if your component has features that are going to be dynamically added after the fact then it's not going to get one of these these IDs so whatever in the background does all this is not even going to see those elements so you can't use that so you basically have to go back to plain old style sheets so I was trying my best to get everything I could out of this stylesheet and I found I was I was trying to get take as much as I couldn't put it in the components and it wasn't working and that's how I eventually found out hey it doesn't work if you're adding things dynamically so I'm still gonna have to keep some things in the stylesheet I won't be able to put it all in the style JSX tags so anyway just wanted to fill you all in on that in case you were working with something similar so what I need to do then I think I copied what I had to copy but I need to put it in this style dot CSS and I'm just gonna throw it down the bottom so my CSS file is a mess I was trying to edit things earlier and it's like really I guess I didn't copy what I thought I copied but it's actually getting really hard to edit things because the CSS is just all over the place so I really need to take some time and and work on that if I do get time which I don't know if I'll have time any time soon but that's also if you're if you're kind of just starting out and you want to get a you know you want to build up your github profile that might be something somewhat simple to start out with just to go through and mess around and see how much of the Styles here you could pull out you could either take out completely because I've already duplicated it in the components or pull it out and put it in the components make sure it still works that's just kind of tedious work that's not difficult but it just takes time to do in the tests so I know sometimes it can be hard starting out contributing to projects so it's good if there's some kind of like easier tasks and as always I don't I don't expect anyone to contribute to this this project you know I I'm happy of y'all just watching and everything but if you want to I really do appreciate that let me see I need to grab the color I thought I had it out here somewhere I guess would be done yep I have it done here I will say this if I was really setting this project up in a better way right off the bat I would have like CSS that gets imported and I could probably have I could probably be running SAS have variables for my colors potentially I could even set up like real JavaScript variables since I'm using you know JavaScript within or I'm using CSS within the JavaScript so there's a lot of different ways I could do this that are better if you haven't been watching you know from the beginning this was a conversion from a static site so a lot of this is just left over and in reality some of the things that are still in this CSS file aren't even being used at all because they were even pulled over from a previous site that was entirely different at a different color scheme and but it was a good jump start to this project so there are things that are in here that have never been used on this project that just never got taken out so I'm not saying that's a good way to do things or just explaining this the current state of the project so I need to do a hard refresh because I don't I don't get to refresh when I edit a CSS file the auto refresh okay that looks a lot nicer than the yellow it's definitely easier to read and it fits better with the color scheme alright that works now I actually I don't think I have this working yet yeah it doesn't work so maybe we'll do that so I did get get this working which this wasn't difficult it was just a matter of adapting the code that I think Fabian had done a pull request and I just needed to adapt it so that I wasn't using masonry and I was instead using these I can see this I'm not getting the the border on this top one so I'm not really worried about it now because I think bill who's frequently in Live Chat sent me some code to do a nice effect with a horizontal rule instead of a border so I'll probably replace that anyway so I'm not going to worry about that right now but let me commit this before we go on to the next thing and I'll do it on on this screen so you all can see especially if you're if you're new to get into the command line they'll give you a little bit of extra a little extra info about it I'll explain it as I go along so we're on a separate branch we're not on the master branch we're doing all this new stuff on the new resource UI branch so if you want to follow along in the in the repo on github that's the branch we're on so we're gonna do a get status just to make sure what's change okay occasionally you do a get status and you see something that's changed and you don't know why so I always like to do it unless I'm absolutely sure what's changed and it's only a minor thing I always want to check so resources component has changed the style sheet has changed and then I've added this material select component so that's good there's what that's expected so we can do get add and put a dot to add everything and you can see now everything's ready for me to add a commit message to and then I can take it commit and then if I put the M flag I can put my message right here if I leave out that flag and I just hit Enter when I hit get commit it will pull up whatever your preferred editor is which by default might be Nano but for me I think I set mine to be atom so then you would have to put in your message otherwise like that if you have a really long message that's probably the better way to go but this is faster if you have a short message so in this case mine would be mmm I don't think I've really done anything else that's that pretty much sums up what I've done I think we have an error oops so an it select it's not defined so what I need to do is just put in an exception so that it doesn't throw this error anymore so that's cool I'm glad it through that error because I don't think I ever explained live why I needed to make these exceptions okay so let me show you so up here I've needed to put this in so what I'm using some type of like an it function that I have here in my app is file I've done this it throws an error if I try to use it without putting this and so in it and it select so now we'll ignore the fact that this is not defined so there are better ways to do this as well this was kind of a workaround to get all my jQuery stuff to work now we'll try again it should work this time well that's alright so that works and I'm gonna push that right up to get it up immediately so y'all can see it if you want to and I'm gonna check in the live chat now since there's quite a bit going on in there and I don't want to get too far behind so next step I'm saying this out loud so I don't forget as well next step is going to be actually hooking this up so when he click one of these it actually works and it filters okay so the Nate says check out preact compact which I used it adds react compatibility layer for preact the only issue I face is with react transition group for which we can alias to our C CSS transition group okay so I did read a little bit about the preact contest so I saw that that's what you had had used but in the I guess it was in the package.json file I saw that so that's if you're just joining and you didn't hear at the beginning vinay had submitted a pull request that would shift everything over to preact which is a more lightweight kind of version of react and he's also added something so that it's compatible with what we've already done called pre at compat so vinay saying there's one issue so I'm not exactly sure with the with the issue is I mean Vinay it sounds like you know you have a handle on it just let me know is this an issue that should I wait on pushing this you know out to the live site to production or if should it be okay because I I have no experience at all with pre act so I'm relying relying on you on Vinay and all of you to fill me in on any potential pitfalls okay let's see hey zan is here hey Ben didn't notice I saw it yesterday I was and I saw you'd said goodbye and then I didn't even get to that part so sorry I did say goodbye on the video but I think you'd already gone but so a belated goodbye and hello nah okay all right now I see most of what was in the lab chat was still talking about code editors as usual okay I see now as Anna just said yesterday when I said I was sorry I meant sorry had a rough tough weekend you know what I am when I was driving home from work yesterday I it hit me that that's what you were talking about and I felt like an idiot because I had I just totally forgot sometimes it's it's hard it's hard to keep since I can't keep up with the live chat and code at the same time and I have to take breaks it frequently happens that I forget what I had said you know just a few minutes before and then you you were you all were responding to what I had said but I I just don't I don't get it because I don't remember so I don't really know the way around that because there's there's just usually a lot of activity in the live chat so I really can't I don't think I could do both I couldn't respond to every message as it came in in real time and still code so but I'll do my best to try to remember that but anyway thank you for that Anna I appreciate that I had we had we had a loss in a family over the weekend so yeah I was just pretty down about that and I think I didn't realize it yesterday but this morning I woke up I think I'm starting to get sick like a cold or something my throat's a bit swollen and it hurts so that might have been adding to it but it's just feeling you know a little weird and down like out I don't know if they were happy to you but I was literally like I was sitting here I was working yesterday morning you know writing some code and like I didn't know where it was just like I felt like I was gonna start crying and it just passed over me it was like five seconds and then I was I was okay but I was like man Leawood is going on I think it was just like the emotion of everything that happened like I just was really busy and it hadn't hit me until like that point and then it just all hit me at once and then I was okay but we'll see I'm actually gonna go see I go to a counselor once a month and just for some like minor depression and stuff but I see you later today so in a couple hours so maybe I'll bring it up and make sure I'm not going crazy or anything but anyway enough enough about my mental health sorry for the for the tangent okay we had a question so Viper I behave I'm not sure if or announce that I really sorry I I know I probably messed that up it's vai be hav says unemployed I stay at home all day how can I keep learning to code and build projects how can I be productive I would say if if the trouble is like just staying motivated to be productive try to find projects that you you really care about and then maybe that'll be extra motivation if it's something you can get excited about then I think it'll be a lot easier for you to keep going also this is somewhat I guess unrelated to coding but I found it's helped me out as well if I can get in a little bit of exercise you know every day I find that I just have more energy and motivation I'm much more likely to actually do something and sometimes I'll get a bit of exercise and a solution to some coding problem will come to me while I'm I'm exercising and so I don't I think there's something about the effect of exercise on the brain that helps you work through problems like that so if that's a possibility for you as well that would that could could help but I know it's tough I went through a period of being unemployed and then I've gone through when I was freelancing I've gone through periods of not really having you know clients or not a lot of clients you know and those are tough periods too to try to go through but you try to like set a schedule for yourself and try to be consistent you know that can help to set some goals but hopefully but you know keep keep me informed keep us informed maybe it would be good if you know occasionally if you can join us for the live chat and just let us know what you're working on everything then that might help as well that you know you might get excited about you know filling us in on what you're doing and if I see you if I remember and I see you in a live chat you know it in the future I'll ask you how things are going so you have a unique name I haven't seen anybody else of that name so hopefully I'll remember and I could ask you anyway hopefully that advice helps I'm sure you know people in the live chat have some great advice as well Court Court says in Russia computers have only two gigabytes hard disk that's crazy it's that serious as anybody else from Russia can you verify that because that sounds really really crazy I mean if you were like on a Chromebook in that cloud storage it that would be fine but yeah really crazy Jordan asks what packages do you use I don't know I use I have a lot of different packages so I don't know I can't really go through them now maybe I'll try to make a video on all the packages I'm using I guess I could while I'm going through some of the questions in the live chat I'll put up on the screen the packages I have I need to configure this but I won't do it on on the screen because that'd be kind of boring but if you want the style JSX tag to be highlighted properly there's a little bit of code you have to put in here so I'll need to find out where that code is and copy and paste that I think it's in the documentation for next j/s so if you wanted to use this to get better you know syntax highlighting and things and auto indentation just now you have to put that little bit of code in so let me show you here's here's just some of the packages I have I know this is a little bit small but if I make it bigger you won't be able to see as many so I'll leave this up here for now and I'll scroll down a bit in a few minutes that way you can see what I'm using the court court says no coding I want write code now is they are you meaning that I should quit talking and write code or what or you want to write kiss either way if you want to write code go ahead but I'll get to the code in just another minute there's not a lot left here in the in the live chat okay Sebastian said that yellow is unreadable at least in the stream is Hannah agrees yeah for sure that yellow I've had issues with that I actually found a slightly different shade of that yellow that works a lot better so I've used it in some other sites if you if you like if you convert the color from a hex color into like the H hlsa color or something I might have those in the wrong order the you can darken it right so you can keep basically the same color but darken it a bit and then it makes it much more readable but it doesn't really change the color that much so it appears to be the same color but it's just a lot more readable so I've switched to that color on my newer projects but I think the one that was still there was leftover and kind of like the base theme that I always use for university websites oh as Anna said I hate it when CSS is all over the place yes yes they'd say just it just happened you know at some point you just started getting so much CSS and if you don't like me if I just I didn't I just didn't stay on top of things and then I got out of control so I'll have to keep that in mind the next time I'm doing a project so that I'm more disciplined about my organization right off the bat okay Sebastian says you can import your CSS and the components you can make a CSS file per component so yeah Sebastian that's that's a better way to do it and that's what I'll if I have time I'll probably go that route the reason as I said that it was in one big component or one big file was because that that's how it was in the site that I I came over from so you just never got around to actually splitting it up okay Jeremy like said a couple things and then retracted and said never mind I got it so so glad you got it here on Evo or Ivo Ivo says hey James I've been following the live stream along for a little while and I understood that you have built a reactive website with WordPress as the backend and then Sebastian corrected as Jesse yes it's cool I know what you meant actually when you said that it reminded me of the characters from Pokemon just like the Team Rocket members once named Jesse and other ones James it's like my kids are really into Pokemon right now so that's immediately I thought of that so anyway to continue on Iowa says I'm really curious as to how this worked out for you and what the lessons you learned about this project my previous internship used to Drupal backend and its HTML engine so Zanna did explain he just uses the WordPress API to pull data out from another website that that is true yeah then he thought apologized for I getting the name wrong it don't worry about it it's not a big deal so anyway he said the solution with the Drupal engine usually involve writing custom JavaScript code which always overwrote each other and made a huge mess of the HTML as well as the application state yeah that sounds like a mess yeah so anyway legs Anna said since I'm not it I'm just taking the data that's entered into WordPress and I'm not using their templating system at all so that kind of eliminates a lot of the issues that I would if I was trying to work in to the actual like the templates I'm not sure what the terminology is in Drupal I haven't worked with Drupal that much so I'm like the terminology might be a bit different from Drupal WordPress but you know normally these templates are made in PHP and then they get rendered serverside with PHP and HTML if I was trying to use Java scripts or real react in particular with that I probably would have run into more issues but since I'm doing it this way and I'm basically just dealing with data coming in the form of JSON it makes it a lot easier so I actually am interested though and how you would potentially do the similar thing with Drupal because there are some sites connected with this site that I'm building that are built on Drupal so there's a learning management system that is that this site is going to direct people to and then they'll go and they'll sign up and it's like I think a yearly fee or something and they'll be able to take all these courses that system is built on Drupal and then there's another site that's a magazine that's associated with with this website and that site is built on Drupal as well so potentially if I could expose Drupal data through some sort of API I could pull it into this site as well that would be nice because the people entering in data wouldn't have to duplicate data so I'm interested in in that I don't have direct access to any of those Drupal sites like it to the backend so I couldn't implement anything but there's an outside company that that is building those so potentially you know they would have to set up the API and then I could use it but I assume that Drupal could do something similar to what the WordPress API does it'd be even better if it would use graph QL instead of a regular REST API but that would be ideal if you if you don't haven't heard of graph QL check it out it's GRA pH and then the letter Q and the letter L really really cool what's it's like I I suspect that it's gradually gonna take over a lot of things that use a REST API now we'll switch to graph QL but for right now there wasn't an easy way to do that with WordPress so that's why I just stuck with a normal API oh no Sebastian said apparently what I said about CSS doesn't work on next Jas oh I'll have to keep that in mind so splitting up things into like separate CSS files for components doesn't work so off to check that out more there's got to be some better way to do it also Sebastian mentioned by the way you're missing the border bottom in the first item from the list yeah I did I saw that let me let me switch back to here actually let me let me put up while I'm going through this I'm gonna put up the code all here I had the code on the screen what am I thinking I want to put this up here so you can see some of the stuff that Andrew did to change basically make the the search function a little bit better so it won't make so many API calls it works better with like the mobile virtual keyboard so you just kind of check this out now of course this also on the github page Sebastian says sorry to hear about that yeah I appreciate that thanks for saying as anna says we're humans not robots crying his natural yeah that's true that's sure it was just odd to have it happen like right in the middle of just just working just going more often and nature helps a lot actually that's a good idea I haven't spent that much time outside for a while I did go to the beach a couple weeks ago so I just went some time at the beach but that might not be a bad idea I actually have like my my house has a little over an acre of land around it and part of it is just like yeah it's just a bunch of trees and stuff so but I rarely get out and actually enjoy it I'm always you know coding or something so maybe I ought to just go out and walk around take the kids they'd probably like that okay Zanna had some advice for the vibe have which like I said I'm sure I'm probably mispronouncing your name if you want to try to explain how to pronounce your name I I will definitely try to pronounce it correctly from now on but anyway the advice is write emails for startups out there I'm sure you could find an internship the best way to learn is coding real stuff small tasks so anyway that's that's great advice I wouldn't never even thought about that of just emailing different companies for internships and stuff but that's a really good idea Jeremy says in the same boat but the live chat helps me a I'm really glad that this the live chat is helping helping you all I do I think the latch that is one of the best parts about about this that's why I take so much time to try to read out everything that I can in the live chat for the people who are watching later on because if the if the show was just me talking it wouldn't I mean it would not be nearly as good and helpful for people I think you all make it so much better okay yeah ratha asks can we watch this afterwards and Umberto's says yes the video is posted in about five minutes thanks for answering that I'm just reading it out loud for in case you know anybody else I imagine there might be some people watching this they can't look at the live chat for whatever reason maybe they're they're just listening to it and doing other things so I just wanted to read that out for those people Zanna recommends let's see following sites like remote okay or internships and found a startup cool so Zanna actually was able to find a startup for an internship so that's that's awesome so that's definitely really good advice so if you're in that same position you know just trying to get some experience and you know just doing doing side projects and things you know definitely try to get a hold of companies you like and get an internship I vote says I checked out graph QL before and it's really interesting would recommend it as well you pronounce my name is Eva okay awesome Dutch pronunciation is weird okay cool alright so I'll try to remember that so Evo that's that's actually fine and I used to teach Latin and in Latin in the the there's a couple of different ways you could pronounce Latin but in the pronunciation style that I used in my class you would pronounce an AI is e anyway so so that's not really that weird to me Sebastian says check out Gatsby Jas I've heard about Gatsby I haven't used it yet but it sounds really cool Jordan says there is a drupal plugin for a rest api awesome so that's cool so if I'll have off to remember so it shouldn't be too big of a deal then just to have this company install the plugin and set up a REST API if we need it that's awesome Zanna says I was on fever fiber not showed up for not fi ve or R for a while coded small small things for for peanuts especially CSS GS animations but I also learned a lot from that yeah cool I was on a similar site before too and that's kind of how it goes you don't really make a lot of money off the sites like that but you do get experience so if that's what you need then it's it's definitely I mean it's better than doing nothing right oh if I have says I did pronounce the name correctly so awesome Zanna said gave up on Fiverr because people are mostly asked me to copy things from other sites and didn't like that felt like stealing yeah that kind of stinks I mean I'm I'm all for getting inspiration from other sites but just straight copying I'm I don't I don't like that yeah I mean there's definitely a difference between you know learning from other people but and copying from other people okay Evo said in regard to the to the Drupal plugin the drupal rest api plugin check that out didn't really have that much time to investigate so I mean I'm assuming that it works in a similar manner to the WordPress plugin I mean at least in terms of getting the data you know rest the way data comes out of REST API is somewhat similar you know for most places okay Adam says thanks for taking time to share this appreciated oh I appreciate you saying that Thanks thanks for watching and contributing in the chat as how did you get started collaborating with free code camp I'd love to do some things with them with teaching angular so actually for free code camp stuff ayat I started live streaming on my own YouTube channel and I did a few streams and then Bo from free code camp who does all like the JavaScript tutorial stuff he I guess watch one of my videos so I posted in the free code camp forum and I just I wanted help for people to give me tips on like how to improve my stream so I explained what my idea was for the stream which was just to show people what my normal work day is like and I asked for advice and so I think he saw that that link in the forum watched one of the videos and then he asked me if I'd be interested in in doing some streams on free code camp and so I talked to Bo and I talked to Quincy just through email and I ended up doing some streams and they like the streams and so I I said well you know I'll stream here every day then if that's alright and they said yeah so so I'm streaming and I let them I let him know coincident bowbow that if they ever don't want me to stream any more to please let me know because I want to be helpful to people and if I'm not helpful and I don't want to waste waste of time on the chain but evidently they must be happy with with the streaming I think they are Quincy occasionally will drop into the live chat and he seems to be happy with with what's happening and told some people on Twitter over the weekend that I was doing a good job so so that was that's how it happened for me I kind of really didn't like I didn't imagine that that would happen at all so it was a very very nice surprise and enabled me to basically like instantly have an audience of people you know because freak I think my youtube channel has less than 500 subscribers and free code camps over seven hundred and seventy thousand definitely much better subscriber base here all right so anyway Adam if you want to do things with free code camp then I you know just reach out I would say reach out to Tabo or Quincy or both you reach out on Twitter or in the in the forum probably Twitter would be the most direct way to reach out and if you have any examples of videos or streams that you've done already then that would be cool to just say the get this out I'm interested and just see how it goes from there I can't really help you any more than that because I don't I don't really have any decisionmaking power within free code camp I just you know I I do my my little thing you know and and that's it I think that's kind of how it works everybody that volunteers with free code camp just kind of does their own little thing to help out and you know there are definitely some people with Quincy and everything that have more oversight over things but it's very much like kind of a decentralized thing you know there's a ton of meetups all over the world and things and this was very very decentralized Oh aim high is here hey how's it going so so aim high recently got a job so how's it going so far I am actually I was really excited about that because aim high will come in from time to time into the live chat and and give updates from even like in the the job hunting process and then it through the interviews and everything and then getting a job so I'm really excited excited about it alright so I'm gonna get back to coding because I just spent a really long time in the live chat so I see there's a couple more things that were just posted in the live chat so I'll get back to those in a minute I think this is these packages have been up on the screen long enough so I think I'm probably safe too I guess I'll leave them up for now so I don't forget about configuring this package but for now as I said the next step is going to be making this work so when you click one of these it actually does filter filter this out so let's let's just check out some of the filters that we already have because this is not going to be very different from what we're already doing actually oh did we already set this up yeah we did I can't believe I forgot that yeah I remember this now yeah because someone in the live chat had given some some code for this and I'm sorry I can't remember who it was I'm really sorry about that I really usually and in somewhat decent about remembering who contributed so really sorry I can't remember who contributed this little bit of code it wasn't a pull request it was just you know copy and pasted into the live chat but in any case so we do have some filter by category stuff going on and then we were just changing the state and then that is what we'll filter by so I don't know if we actually put the filter on though hold on a second let me see those resource category okay sorry we actually filtering sure thing here sorry I'm just trying to figure out what we did since I didn't remember that we did it okay alright so this okay alright so this category thing in the state is what actually populates that that select that dropdown this category is what is gonna the filters gonna be based on so this is gonna change so it's going to be not the category name but the category number so zero is gonna give us everything so let me go down and so when we do filter by category if it's zero see we return true for everything otherwise we're gonna return so I think I have some check in here for undefined that our return false otherwise it's actually gonna take the the category and return things with that actual category so so what we need to do now is take that select input and we want to make it so that every time something changes with that input it changes States this is going to be a cool thing to demonstrate right because I don't think we've done this yet at least in the stream so what we're gonna do to this input exists in another component so it's not gonna be as straightforward as it normally is you know we we can't just you know call this function you know right here so what we're gonna need to do is actually we're gonna make a we're gonna make a function that sets the state to whatever the value is of this and that function is going to live here right because this state is needs to be in this component right because this state is gonna change things you know on this page so first things first let's let's make that but then we're going to pass that that function as a prop to here and then we can do our on change to get the value here and on the change what's going to happen is we're going to call that function and we're going to pass in the value into that function and that's going to make it actually run the function here change the state here and resources and then a state change is going to trigger a rerender and then that's gonna be what filters everything hopefully that made sense if it didn't make sense when I explained it it will probably make more sense when I actually do it so first thing we're gonna do let's put this we'll put it by the filter so keep them together a bit let's say set cast category that works alright so I'm gonna be set category and we're gonna pass in category number just can't abbreviate that as cat num and let's basically all we're gonna do then is go this set state and we're gonna take category and we want to set it equal to cat none and that's that's it this is going to be just really simple so now we need to go down to here we have material select so let's go okay so I think that's how we need to do this if this ends up not working I actually just did this on a project I'm doing for the Udacity course that I'm taking so I can double check it on there because I've had to do this a few times for that project but I think that's that should work so now this will get passed as a prop so in here it's gonna select input and actually I gotta remember how to get a value from a select input because I haven't done that in a long time so on my other screen I just looked up how to get the value and the first page I went to it's not great so let's go to stack overflow everybody's giving jQuery answers I don't want jQuery answers actually I kind of wanna see where's my select input okay the values are there it's correct so I want to select something it's that selected all right so just straight up value does not work I guess I will have to look it up I thought I might get lucky and just try it maybe you have to see which one is selected can't believe I'm getting stuck on something so simple I know I've done this before plenty of times maybe stuff okay well in jQuery is dot Val which is not gonna help me that much because I don't want to use jQuery let me try to find it what it is using just JavaScript it looks like it might just be valued hmm let's just try it with value then all right so on the select input we're going to do an on change and we're gonna say on change and let me see actually I really I think I do want to see how I did this on my other project so let me bring it over it's probably worth worth sharing so anyway so this is my no this isn't mine this is Bill's where's mine sorry bill if you didn't want your project on on YouTube I thought I had mine up somewhere all right so this is when and I'm pretty sure I did it with this there we go that's what I was I was looking for this syntax here okay so looking for then I could probably shorten this to E save a bit and I don't need the first part and when I was doing it before that was a stateless functional component so I need to add this props to this one breath work and what did we call it we called it set category all right so this cross target value okay so let's check it out we'll save that and then I'm also gonna add into this function a good old console just to see what we're getting in case it doesn't work we'll see what we're getting right away so let's test it out nothing happened all right let's see maybe I just didn't refresh it's possible with my I guess it's not hmm I'll show one more time okay so that's its not being triggered so our own change event is not triggering anything so we need actually let me look at this project again because I'm pretty sure I have a select drop down in the project so it says here I'm Bo yeah this is a select on change okay I see what's happening all right let's try chimes knocking I'm thinking okay this I added this in for another reason so this is irrelevant for what we're doing now so on change this should work let's check out how I pulled it in though in the main the main component here so I move book there we go so I pulled it in here so it's being pulled in as shelf yeah it looks like it's work it's working in here all right let's check out let's check this out again and see what's going on okay so and maybe it's just something silly like I misspelled something okay so we have set category so on change we're gonna get the value right let's let's just take this out for a second and see if we can get a console out of this nope not getting anything no nothing okay I'm gonna go to the live chat because it's possible that some of you have already figured out what my problem is and I've been foolishly ignoring the left all right so I'm gonna scroll up to about the time when I first started having the problem I see there's some questions in here I will I will come back and get to the questions as soon as we get this working well so I'm just kind of scanning through to see and someone says Jay says there's a grandma in Japan as 86 years old and learned how to develop an app that's awesome as Anna said she lived in Japan for two years that's awesome I would love to live in Japan I'm a big fan of sushi and ramen and it would be amazing to go there because there are so many places to get sushi and ramen where I live you can't buy ramen anywhere like at a restaurant they just don't have it I have to drive into Pittsburgh to find a ramen place and even in Pittsburgh there's there's not many places you can go to get it with sushi there are like two sushi restaurants near where I live but they're not like they're not really good I mean it's okay it doesn't taste bad but it would it would be cool I like the color Japanese culture as well there's a lot of cool things about it okay so it looks like there's a lot of awesome conversation going on the live chat but not exactly related to my problem so let's get back to the research so I'm actually gonna bring over I usually don't do research on this screen but I'm going to now so let's say say I want to think now if I've gotten the value from a select input in one of my previous projects aside from the one I just checked I think I have but let's see if it's all right cool so evidently this is Wow sorry I just saw this on the side here anybody looking for a chub seeing yourself we're developer 130,000 to 150,000 dollars a year and you can work remote that sounds like a great deal ellaby that's like so much more than I make right now I can't even imagine what that would be like okay let's see this said state yeah this is pretty much what we're doing we're getting the target value we have unchanged all right let me check the code again is it seems like we're doing what you know I'm doing pretty much the same thing and another site that I worked on earlier this week and it worked and it's also pretty much the same thing that we just saw in the stack overflow page there so what is the problem oh I want to check one thing where's my so I want to check how I pass this okay is this the problem in yeah I think this is the problem all right so there's definitely a difference in how I pass this in so that's that makes sense this is the only thing I really haven't checked over yet so let's find that material select so so I would I did that kind of fast so I'm not sure if anybody caught it but you'll see it now so basically I was just passing in you know this function like that but that isn't how I did it in my other project that that works so this is what I need to do now is get what I'm what I'm passing here is by a second call whatever I won out what was i calling it and then i call this and set category okay so this this makes more sense as to how it was working I don't know what I was thinking earlier so yeah so this will then and should work maybe I'm still a little worried though that even our console.log didn't work but let's take this out and that set it to what we had it at before and make sure I save it in both places and now let's give it a try okay not working let me check out I want to check out what state is nice and not showing me where status I guess I can check out what the props are at least mmm okay I'm gonna check the live chat again okay it looks like Oliver is put something in here this is the category and all of this process a category you've copied it's from a savings component oh good catch good catch I see let me see is this set category and not this prop set category you've copied from a stateless component ok she's saying this actually this should be right this should be this props category so the other the other component I use was a stateless functional component so it was just this set category but in this case I need to have this props correct so I don't think I read the comment out loud so sorry the the the comment was talking about the difference between using this set category versus this props set category so on my my other example here I used I guess I had clicked every but on my other example I had a stateless functional component so I just had to do props set category right yeah so at this point the only change that I can think of the alien is different that's really different between these are the fact that there's some other stuff going on here it's not just a normal select input so maybe what I need to look up is so maybe hey all right there's a github issue for this okay so someone else using the T realize wants to get the value okay but all these these examples using jQuery I don't want to use jQuery also it's it's a different alright I'll take one more and then we'll try something try a few things yes alright materialized CSS with react Jas let's see what's going on here okay so there was an answer but I'm not sure whether or not it worked it says no votes wasn't selected the this is pretty much the exact situation that we have but this is a little little odd so it's saying to put a wrapper around it all and then track this change event inside component did mount I don't know any any thoughts on this method I'm not really sure that this is really the best way to go I mean if it works it works but it seems to me like there's got to be a more straightforward way of doing it I'm gonna check the live chat again cuz I think I have asked a few questions and then never checked looks like we now have a slack channel that's cool so so if I have created a slack channel its FCC pair programming dot slack calm so that's pretty cool we also have a channel an IRC channel on freenode and it's hashtag FCC Jessie so FCC J esse so we have that actually I haven't logged into the channel for for a little while I have to remember I kind of forgotten to login okay I'm Barry toe said maybe it's time to restart the server so that's actually a good idea it has happened in the past that I couldn't figure out what is going on and then I restart the server and somehow it works this it's worth a shot oh well not working alright now this I'm gonna run through every line and I'm gonna look at every line and just just to say maybe that the weird thing is is I'm not I didn't see any error messages I mean any new error messages but let me read them okay so I usually get a lot having unique key prop okay I probably should give the key prop okay so this is a warning related to the value on the select option so it's possible that that is messing something up these are just related to using localhost out there so let's let me see this resource drive I thought I had added a key but I guess I didn't I guess I'll have to pass in I get it doesn't really matter there's no way that that is messing up what I'm doing now but I wouldn't need to put a key a unique key on there and I'll just use the ID the WordPress ID but for now let's check this out again so let me look the I guess I could test and see if something is messing it up because we're changing it with jQuery so I could stop initializing it and then let's refresh so it's gonna be invisible for now so I'm gonna have to change it manually so this select is gonna set the displaynone so we'll just kind of manually get rid of that we'll check out okay so it's still not happening so it's probably not due to to what's going on since it's still not working the other thing I can check out is the actual data see the key value let me remove this because we were getting in a a warning related to that and we could so let me initialize this again okay so didn't do anything except to change so that choose the categories and displayed right away hmm look at this again yes Wow I'm really surprised I didn't think it was going to be this difficult to just get the value from this let me check out okay so patrick has pasted in a link to a github issue so let's see go check it out I'm I'll bring it over so okay cool so this is the on change event for select is not propagated yeah this actually thanks Patrick this seems like this could be exactly our problem is that nothing's happening for that on change event even when we just wanted a simple console.log we didn't get anything so this is probably what's happening here is the the on change event is not it's not find others it's probably firing but it's just not registering at all alright so I do want to check out I'll change this okay let's go down a bit then to this it's always good when you go through an issue in github whichever one has the most cool emojis is probably the best answer if you only remember one thing from today's stream remember that just look for all the emojis okay well let's try it this is actually somewhat similar to that other stackoverflow thing that I saw it was using component did mount so just gonna scroll through really quick to see if there's something with even more emojis okay the only thing I don't like about this still using jQuery wait a second okay so anyway I read this in which it seems like this is similar to what they're saying is basically like a container around it should work so I guess I guess we could we can at least test it out to see if it would work so the first thing I'm going to test out basically I know the same put it in a component did mount and then binding this but based on the other thing that I read I'm it's possible that if we wrap this in a div that we could get an event to fire based on that that div unless I'm reading this wrong which is possible because at this point it's starting to get a bit frustrating okay yeah that seems like what it's saying so this is just going to be really simple for now just seeing if I can get an event to fire Hey we get to fire once okay so we got one change what we get do we get another one let's see no we just got one but yep one change come on all right so that's not gonna help us okay let me I'm gonna check the lap chat again cuz now I'm starting to see some other things here set the value on the Select element T Anderson's has set the value and see oh yeah Patrick says I can just replace the jQuery with the document get element by ID yeah that's that's true resin wants someone to say hi hi Reza okay and Oliver says try just simply passing the function name this props a category changes yeah actually I kind of want to try this now because I don't think we ever tried it with just the console long and nothing else see if we can get a get a response okay once again we're just getting one shoot looks like we've gotten one too so again too sweet hey Fabien sir how's it goin Fabian all right I will have to see ya whether or not we get it working I'll have to stop with the coding and do some questionandanswer here and maybe I don't like 15 minutes so we'll try and get this working so anyway so let me let me just go back to the the github issue on react and let's just try try some of this stuff okay uh I see that's a good answer just youth use a different thing looks like the link does not work I was just looking I was wondering what because obviously we're not using a function name handle select change okay yeah I'm doing all right baby and I'm just stuck on something that should be easy and in fact something that I have working on another site that I got working just a few days ago and for some reason it's not working here all right so let's yeah let me I want to go back to what we had before I've changed a lot of stuff so I'm gonna start just want to start from the beginning of where we had it oops I don't want to get that far back okay alright so this is what we initially started with okay and see yeah Patrick says men should the the on change didn't even fire at all was just calling it console logon load yeah so that it wasn't really wasn't really helping so it was probably we was probably calling it twice because what's the data came in and everything rearended then it got caught again okay so we're gonna try Patrick's advices let's replace replace the dis props with console.log e and see what's going on okay we'll see I may not since it wasn't even firing I'm not even sure what we're gonna get let me refresh and let's change no not getting anything dang it I accidentally clicked on a link now my my dev server is frozen okay and I actually well I had to remove that earlier than it came back when we went back everything so okay so let's check out its inspect it all right I got it I gotta get go out in the hallway for a second so just give me an update I'm sorry many people yeah there's definitely a chunk of it that I couldn't eat off and everything would still look like it's finished so if I have to write yeah just make sure I want to make sure you are aware of that because the 17th possible starts and I don't know what they're going to be doing there show and tell but I know that they are so whatever you don't then you got two days when you get back to see what you can publish so the main thing is it'll be I have things sorted out so like here it's okay I just want to remind you like I just did the exact same thing a few days ago okay sorry for the interruption there but that was the head of my department so kind of had to take that because that was my my boss's boss's boss so I really couldn't leave her waiting and she was actually asking about the site that I'm working on right now and reminding me that once the 20th comes I am done with his site no matter what so to make sure that whatever state it's in on the 20th is is reasonable and you know it'll look like it's a finished site which I don't think she'd be a problem it looks like it's a finished site right now at least the version that's live so if I have to leave something off I'll probably leave off the the news section that's supposed to function like a blog because right now there's not really a lot of content and so that's probably the section that's the least amount of content so it would I guess be okay if we left it off so anyway I'm gonna check the live chat quickly just to see what I missed for the few minutes that I was gone and okay looks like I didn't really miss there was some conversation but not directly related to our issue tell you what here's what I'm gonna do it occurred to me that this is actually kind of like really weird so our issue was related to this being materialized framework right I mean that's what we were thinking and that's what we're looking at but when I didn't initialize it as a materialized input we still had an issue so if that's the case then maybe the issue is not maybe there's a like two issues potentially maybe there's another issue so I'm gonna try this again let's do this and let me remove this class of input field because it's possible that materialized is picking up on that class our options I think everything else was fine and let's try this out now and see if we get anything the only other thing I could think of is potentially it's a problem that all of these options are being added in after the fact and we could certainly test that out easily by hardcoding some options and seeing if that's if that's the case if it is the case all these options then maybe we have to put something to fix that in component it update but for now let's just try this now it shouldn't have done that it should have there we go actually let me put oops I need to so since materialized by default puts displaynone on select inputs I'm gonna display block and then that way I don't have to keep building that all right so here's display let's change it up and see alright so let me bring this over so we have and I've so much stuff let me do this again so we can just get a more clean looking setup here okay so look we've gotten something right which is better than what we had before if if it comes down to it I'm fine with just doing a bit of styling on this I'm not I'm not tied down to using the materialized input I've actually I've been unable to use the material i style input on a few other projects that I had and I've been able to style it in such a way that it looks decent not quite as polished there's the materialized input so that's that's fine then we can I can definitely change it also I'm wondering if so basically what's happening is on this select input materialised it's just changing what you see into a list right and then making that list behave basically I could drop down potentially if you wanted to keep that same style all we would have to do is instead of having a select input we just made a list and just had click and it looks like you know when you clicked on a certain thing on the list then it it updated I'd rather not have to go through all that but those are two alternatives that I'm thinking of to just completely bypass all of this stuff so at this point I'm I'm convinced now upon seeing that upon saying that this actually is working when I have materialized disabled then it's definitely materialized ok see and then we got a value so we got the value we want so here's what I'm going to do I'm gonna put back in here what we were originally going to have which I guess was let's just go back to get what we had before okay so that's what we have before and then I'm just gonna add this one again I'm gonna take this out and leave that off just for now I'll probably just completely remove everything but when we do this hopefully we'll get we can get the filtering working and check oh what just happened they are reps oops wait a second so I oops left off a bracket there we go okay so let's try it now come on she's too oh yes it's actually not shoot it's stillit's console logging and we got rid of our console log right we still eat that one in here you know what we might not actually be using this filter off the check so this must be the console oh that's actually working resources yeah so it's coming from the resource page so that's the console log it's working it should be setting the state correctly let's go down to where our filters are okay yeah maybe we don't have a filter for that so let's do that I don't want to filter so I'm gonna filter and actually what it sorry I forgot what I called that actually I had the price that where did I put the price filter in sorry gonna figure this out what the heck so my price filter is not working either I had the price filter working before what did I do that's really odd okay filter by category I need to put in I think that's how I do it I had all my my windows hurt out of the order I want them to be in there we go just don't know what I called it I hope bunny did it it needs to be this sorry about that this dots all right it did something not exactly I wanted it something happen oh that not exactly what we wanted but it's better than nothing okay I think I'm just gonna have to stop for now and figure this out tomorrow because I do have an appointment at 500 that I'll have to leave for soon and I want to get to your questions so just to try to wrap up somewhat as much as I can here the plan is basically to not use the material as input and instead just to style the input a bit so that it looks it looks good as good as you can or potentially make some type of custom dropdown thing and then it would it would look similar to this input but would in fact be a list also figure out what's going on with this filtering it's obviously it's doing something but not exactly what we wanted to do so I'll just have to go through and try some things out I'm gonna think what else that's about it I mean probably if I can get that done the search works these work so basically just getting these two done it'll be functional completely functional in terms of what we want it to do could probably use a bit of polishing up the UI but it'll do what we want it to do so this is really close to being functionally ready so I'll need to check I also want to check to make sure that the posts actually are linked up with the categories I expect that they are but I just want to double check it's not that because if it's the case that we have categories but they're not linked to posts then that would explain why we're getting nothing here it wouldn't explain why they're not showing back up when I click all but anyway so that's the plan so I'll fairly work on that tomorrow or maybe tonight I'm kind of thinking I'm gonna have to put in some work on this at night to get it to where it needs to be anyway so let me go back I'm gonna go back to the lodge that I know there's a ton of stuff in here so I'm gonna try to get through as much as I can before I have to leave so if you do have a question you could put it in there now I'll try to get to it if I happen to not get to it you can message me on Twitter the links in the description or you can put it in the comments for this video or you could just wait til tomorrow and ask me then okay I'm scrolling through these I'm going pretty quick so I can get to the question so it's possible I might miss a question so I'm sorry if I miss miss any questions okay suit sumit had a question about a contact list in an app the web app that they're building so I'm not sure it wasn't us assume it if you're still here you're still listening I need a bit more info if you want to send me a link if you have liked your project on github or something then I could check it out but I'm not sure I could give you a good answer you know just from you know the info that that could be put in and the live chat it pretty better if I could see the code so you can message me direct message me on Twitter and I'll get I'll check it out okay cool Gino says I've signed up today I assume sign up for a free code camp and in two hours I finished the HTML and CSS tomorrow bootstrap King that's awesome that's really cool all right so aim high yeah sorry I asked you a question about your job and then I I got sidetracked with with the the coding and so I didn't read your answers I'm sorry about that but here's the answer so aim high got a job recently and we're all really excited so it says first week has been brilliant working on a project with 30 million users every month team of four developers that's awesome that's that's really really cool yeah congratulations on that name House is loving it so really happy for you that sounds great thirty million users a month that's a lot that's that's amazing Janus is FF developer IDI edited on good for coding I'm not I'm not really sure what that is so I'm sorry I'm saying if you're still around you could explain a bit more I'm just not understanding the question do you know ask what do I need to learn to be a frontend web dev if you're already going through the free code camp stuff if you just keep going through the free code camp frontend thing that'll teach you a lot I definitely work on some projects you know as you pick up skills because you'll need you know you'll need to know how to do your own projects and setup things like that so I would for now at least be starting out you know free code camp will be a great start for you and that's aim high gave similar advice also a nice says go on to dribble and try to convert complex designs into code using HTML CSS that's really good advice I like that Oh John John said Google developer tools has a way to see all unused CSS rules in each page makes it quick to find this content cool yeah I actually I used that when it was on Chrome Canary and it was really cool at that point I don't think it was ready but now it's it's in chrome like the the normal version of Chrome so I have to use it haven't used in a while but that's a that's a great idea Eva said just heads up that chrome tool is did cause cause some trouble before searching for it all right so I'm gonna skip I gotta go in just a few minutes so I'm gonna unfortunately I'm gonna have to skip a lot of just like the comments in the live chat but I will be able to hopefully answer any questions okay Sebastian has a question about an app that he's building about updating state so Sebastian if you want to send me a link if you have it on github and can share I'd be happy to check it out Gino asks what types of code I need to learn to be frontend web dev got some answers in live chat which are good but just for everyone else that's watching that maybe you can't see the live chat if you're watching later on HTML CSS JavaScript if you only learn those you can build web apps frontend and backend if you want to branch out and you know what you want the specifically like you could pick up PHP if you know if that's where you want to go into WordPress is built with PHP Drupal Joomla so it kind of depends on where you want to go but if you're not sure what exactly you want to do yet within frontend web development and I should say if you want to just just stick the frontend you really don't need a backend language like PHP but HTML CSS javascript is you you'll be solid if you really focus on that okay we had some discussions about languages and different things to learn Sebastian said he had to go like an hour ago so he didn't hear any of my responses so maybe he'll be able to catch the the recording if I have asked this free code camp have backend dev streams actually right now I think I'm the only live coding stream on free code camp but we might get some some new people we're talking on Twitter so I can set up Twitter with a few other people who are interested and maybe like being on this stream and like adding some commentary and talking and then Quincy joined in and offered to say you know they could they could come on and actually do their own stream if they wanted to so that's possible I don't know nothing's been said officially yet but it's possible that could be coming mrs. hoese Anna's comment sushi is nowhere quite like in Japan yeah that's what I've heard I'd really love like a while back I was talking about sushi so it's in it was in response to that now I really want some sushi you know I'm thinking about it all right almost to the bottom of the live chat it's not not a really a whole lot of questions today a lot of activity in the chat which is awesome oh yes the question says almost everyone can learn frontend development for free what do you think will web developing sphere become overcrowded Zanna says no there'll be more jobs than coders that's yeah there's definitely way more jobs than coders right now and it doesn't look like that's gonna change anytime soon so I wouldn't worry about that because you can learn to code for free but that it doesn't guarantee that there's quality coders you know you know people who are really dedicated and and you know work hard at it will be the good ones and get the jobs and the so I think in terms of to me I think it's more important to think of like people who are quality coders who really can do the jobs not just necessarily people who say hey it's free to learn how to code I can learn be you know because as long as as long as there's a shortage of quality coders who really know what they're doing they'll always be jobs out there because you know just because you can go out for free and learn what to do you won't necessarily get a job unless you actually are decent so in that sense you know I don't think the markets gonna get flooded with with so many coders just because it's free to learn and Jeremy says in LA I mean Los Angeles there's plenty of companies looking for frontend as cool all cool and rejoining hander Oh Andrew be balanced is working great thanks so much I am I talked about it at the beginning of the show like super helpful it was really impressed with that cool Andrew says but too big react Redux courses from udemy for twenty dollars so that's a great day that's cool keep keep us updated on how the courses are and if they're good then you know let us know this might be a good good investment for learning reacts okay cool so I've gotten to the end of the live chat and unfortunately I have to go but I hate to leave this unfinished and I know I did skip over a lot of good conversation in the chat but I'll be back tomorrow and hopefully this problem will be solved by the time I stream tomorrow and I'll I'll let you know how it went and how I ended up solving it and so I guess you have probably same time tomorrow I don't think I have any meetings or anything thanks so much for all your help in the chat today and for for helping so many people who you know came in newer people who had questions they're just so much good advice and I really really appreciate that also thanks for creating the slack Channel so that's cool yeah if somebody yeah off to remember to put a check out the slack Channel and put a link in it's FCC pair programming slack com so if if you're interested check that out but I'm gonna I gotta go now I got a hurry up and go to my appointment and thunderstorm outside so uh I should probably leave a bit early and anyway I'll see everyone tomorrow and have a great day
