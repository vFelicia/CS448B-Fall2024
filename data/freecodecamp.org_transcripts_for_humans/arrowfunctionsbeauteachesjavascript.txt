00:00 - an arrow function has a shorter syntax
00:02 - than a standard function and does not
00:04 - bind its own this these function
00:07 - expressions are best suited for non-
00:09 - method functions so this is the arrow
00:12 - right here so here are a few examples of
00:14 - how you can write a an arrow function so
00:17 - in parentheses you can put parameters
00:19 - then you put the arrow function and in
00:21 - these curly braces you can put the
00:22 - statements or you can just put an
00:24 - expression without curly braces and when
00:26 - you just have this expression without
00:28 - curly braces it's going to return this
00:31 - so this next line here is equivalent to
00:35 - this line if you put the return it's
00:37 - going to return the value of this
00:38 - expression but if you don't put the
00:40 - return it's still going to return the
00:41 - value of this expression as long as
00:43 - there's no curly braces parentheses are
00:46 - optional when there's only one parameter
00:48 - these two are equivalent so there's no
00:51 - parentheses here if you ever have a
00:53 - function with no parameters it requires
00:56 - parentheses okay now here's what a arrow
00:59 - function function would actually look
01:00 - like compared to a normal function so
01:02 - here's the normal function where you
01:04 - just have the the name and then function
01:06 - pass an X and Y and then here's the
01:09 - statement or expression that you're
01:10 - going to return X and Y but you could
01:12 - write that as an arrow function it's
01:14 - going to be a lot shorter you would
01:15 - either write it like this or like this
01:18 - these are equivalent because you don't
01:20 - necessarily need the curly braces and
01:22 - you don't need the return statement
01:23 - either so this would be the the pretty
01:25 - short way of doing it now Arrow
01:27 - functions work really well with higher
01:29 - order functions such as map filter and
01:31 - reduce that take other functions as
01:33 - Arguments for processing collections of
01:35 - data so here's an example so let's say
01:38 - we have this materials array and here
01:40 - are three ways to do the same thing we
01:43 - have material links one materials length
01:45 - two and materials link three so we're
01:48 - going to do materials. map which you
01:50 - pass in a function and here's passing in
01:52 - a standard function where we're just
01:54 - going to return material. length but you
01:58 - could do it like this here we have the
02:01 - arrow function and we're going to do the
02:03 - same thing but then we can even shorten
02:06 - that Arrow function to put all in one
02:08 - line and you can just do material Arrow
02:12 - materials. L material. length so that's
02:14 - going to be a lot cleaner than doing
02:17 - than doing it like this until Arrow
02:19 - functions every new function defined its
02:21 - own this value an arrow function does
02:23 - not create its own this context so this
02:26 - has its original meaning from the
02:27 - enclosing context so the following code
02:30 - is going to work as expected so we have
02:32 - this person function and down here we're
02:34 - going to create the a new person uh so
02:37 - we have this. age equals z and then
02:39 - we're going to do the set interval where
02:41 - we pass in a function and inside this
02:44 - function we're going to add one to the
02:47 - age in a normal function the word this
02:51 - here is going to refer to the global
02:52 - object but here with the arrow function
02:55 - it's going to refer to the person object
02:58 - so it's going to work as expected it's
03:01 - actually going to change the this. AG
03:04 - here instead of the this. age that would
03:06 - be in the global object another thing
03:08 - you should know about this is whenever
03:10 - you're going to return an object you
03:13 - always have to put the object in
03:15 - parentheses if you look at this line
03:16 - right here inside these curly braces
03:19 - could refer to the statements that you
03:22 - want the the the function to run but it
03:24 - also could refer to an object so to make
03:27 - it clear you're going to have to put the
03:28 - object in parentheses if you want to
03:31 - return an object and the final thing I
03:33 - want to talk to you about for Arrow
03:35 - functions today is that you're not
03:36 - allowed to have line brakes see how it
03:39 - breaks the next line now if you're using
03:41 - curly braces that'll be okay but without
03:43 - curly braces you're just going to have
03:45 - to put it all on one line well thanks
03:48 - for watching my name is Bo KS don't

03:53 - your code for good
