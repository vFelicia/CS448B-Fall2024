00:05 - hey everybody it's
00:06 - Jesse and uh today we're going to
00:10 - continue working on our handling our
00:12 - form data uh which eventually yesterday
00:16 - we finally got the uh file upload uh to
00:19 - work uh so it took a while uh but we
00:24 - kept at it and it worked out uh so was
00:27 - really happy about that
00:30 - uh going a little earlier than normal
00:33 - today uh so I'll um I'll have to finish
00:36 - up at uh finish this up in about an hour
00:40 - and a half so a little bit shorter than
00:42 - I've uh stream uh than I've been doing
00:45 - lately so probably the code portion will
00:48 - finish up in an hour and then after that
00:51 - we can do like a half hour uh question
00:53 - and
00:54 - answer uh and
00:56 - then um then we'll be uh done for for
01:00 - the day and for the weekend but uh we'll
01:02 - see how much we can get done with this
01:04 - uh I want to show you some of the
01:08 - changes so I had some pull
01:11 - requests and so we changed a
01:19 - bit if you want to look um in the
01:24 - repository let's see I'll bring
01:30 - let me bring
01:34 - over the uh files changed here so this
01:37 - would be easier to see what what
01:39 - actually changed so Patrick submitted a
01:42 - pool request I also get another pull
01:44 - request from Kevin uh but it ended up uh
01:48 - they were doing a lot of the same
01:50 - things uh so uh ended up just pulling in
01:54 - um uh Patrick's request cuz it had a few
01:57 - extra things and it was just a lot
01:59 - easier to pool in one than to try to
02:01 - merge uh so thank you to both of
02:05 - you uh for uh for submitting these so
02:09 - basically uh we have um nodon I I've
02:14 - read like so many different ways to
02:15 - pronounce this but I'm going to say node
02:17 - Monon so um so we have that now and uh
02:21 - that's going to uh like watch our new
02:24 - like custom server uh so that we can
02:27 - change stuff in our server and it'll
02:29 - Auto uh it should Auto
02:31 - reload
02:35 - um so we have a new some new things like
02:40 - in our scripts
02:42 - here uh
02:44 - so different ways we're starting the
02:46 - server and this actually now this start
02:48 - server gets called when we run start so
02:52 - the normal start command has a little
02:55 - bit extra on it
02:57 - now and uh what actually ends up having
02:59 - happening
03:01 - is it
03:04 - runs basically it runs our our normal
03:07 - server that we've been running uh for
03:11 - you know for since we started this
03:12 - project on Port 3000 and then it runs
03:15 - the other one that we just made
03:16 - yesterday on Port 9000 or whatever Port
03:19 - we set it
03:21 - to uh and that's kind of nice because
03:25 - yesterday we were like kind of having to
03:28 - manually start it now it's just one
03:30 - command it starts in both um and then
03:33 - that way we can go back and forth uh we
03:38 - still have all the benefits basically of
03:40 - of both of
03:41 - them really without any extra uh extra
03:45 - work so there's a lot of other stuff
03:46 - here you can see like a lot of
03:49 - um uh a lot of variables added uh which
03:53 - is
03:57 - nice and I'll definitely be
04:01 - probably have to add some more in as
04:03 - well when we start working with our
04:06 - apis uh but you can check more of that
04:09 - out if you if you
04:14 - want um let's see and Patrick also put
04:17 - in some explanation as well
04:20 - so that is available uh in the
04:23 - repository also I accidentally merged
04:27 - this into Master instead of custom
04:29 - server so our custom server branch and
04:31 - our Master Branch are now the
04:33 - same uh now I'm still going to do any
04:35 - new stuff in our custom server Branch
04:38 - but I don't know what I was thinking and
04:40 - I didn't realize it until um it didn't
04:43 - say that the pull request was merged and
04:45 - I'm like what the heck I know I merged
04:46 - this and then it hit me that I did it on
04:49 - the wrong Branch
04:52 - so after that I decided to get some
04:56 - caffeine um
05:01 - but other than that there's not really
05:04 - been not really any changes oh I did add
05:07 - one
05:09 - thing uh let me show you so this is
05:12 - where I ended up at basically I added
05:15 - this uh
05:17 - on um sorry I keep getting distracted I
05:21 - have my secondary stream on Instagram
05:23 - but for some reason my phone keeps
05:25 - falling down uh
05:27 - so I don't know why every other day it
05:30 - stays like perfectly where I want it but
05:33 - today it's it's falling down
05:35 - so anyway um so I
05:42 - added uh this this part here so I was
05:45 - just kind of looking through um the uh
05:48 - repository on uh GitHub for uh node
05:53 - formidable looking through their
05:54 - examples trying to see how they do
05:56 - things and uh I found this and I thought
05:59 - oh this will be cool at least we can see
06:02 - uh if all our fields are coming through
06:04 - uh and and how it looks so now we know
06:07 - that we can get all our Fields here
06:11 - and do what we need to with them uh
06:14 - within here so right now we're just
06:16 - logging them uh but this is basically
06:20 - what I want to work on uh today
06:27 - probably let's see
06:30 - I don't know I don't know if I'll do
06:32 - that much more with the with the uploads
06:34 - right
06:35 - now uh at some point I would like to add
06:39 - in I like some security features uh to
06:43 - let's say block out potentially uh
06:45 - malicious files so not sure if I want to
06:48 - get into that today or not uh I probably
06:50 - want to do a little bit more research uh
06:53 - I had added some things in in a previous
06:55 - project some security features but uh I
06:58 - could probably do uh a better job if I
07:02 - spent some more time uh researching it
07:05 - um so if any of you have any ideas or
07:07 - any experience with that you know please
07:09 - please let me
07:11 - know um but otherwise we're going to
07:14 - work on on handling this so we need to
07:17 - grab this we need to do a couple things
07:19 - with this this data uh
07:23 - so we need
07:25 - to email
07:30 - we need to send two
07:31 - emails uh one email
07:34 - to uh our our project
07:37 - manager uh here uh in my department and
07:41 - then we need to send another email to
07:42 - the
07:45 - user and then we need to send the data
07:47 - to our project management system through
07:50 - their
07:52 - API uh when we do that we're going to
07:55 - get some information back and that's
07:57 - going to include a project ID number and
08:00 - then we need to use that project ID
08:02 - number to send the files uh and attach
08:05 - them to that
08:08 - project I think that's all we
08:11 - need yeah I think that's all we need in
08:14 - uh the current version of this we're
08:17 - also sending data to a Google
08:19 - sheet
08:21 - but I don't know if I want to do
08:24 - that I may um
08:30 - I don't know I I'll think about that
08:32 - it's always nice to have another backup
08:34 - but I'm not sure if I want to uh I I
08:38 - kind of want to set up some sort of
08:40 - database to keep track instead of using
08:44 - the Google sheet it might be overkill
08:46 - for this project but i' it's something
08:50 - I'd like to learn how to do and will
08:51 - possibly be using in future project so
08:54 - it might not be a bad idea to try it on
08:55 - this
08:56 - project uh I'm I mean
09:00 - the this project has a very limited
09:03 - internal audience so the stakes are not
09:06 - very high let's say if if this crashed
09:09 - and I didn't do it right I mean I'm not
09:11 - saying but worst case scenario if it if
09:13 - it crashed and we lost a bunch of data
09:16 - all we'd have to do is just call up the
09:18 - people who submitted you know their
09:20 - requests and ask them to tell us what
09:22 - they wanted again right so I feel like
09:25 - it's better to try out something new on
09:27 - a project like this than to try it out
09:30 - on let's say something that you know an
09:33 - external audience would be using a lot
09:37 - more people would be using it would be
09:39 - more of a big deal if it messed up so
09:41 - let me know what you think about that I
09:43 - mean maybe I'm off with my reasoning
09:45 - here
09:46 - but uh so we'll see so we'll basically
09:49 - postpone the decision about whether or
09:51 - not to back up to a Google sheet to use
09:53 - a database or just to not do
09:55 - anything uh and we don't really need to
09:58 - make that decision now but just to let
09:59 - you know what I'm thinking and uh maybe
10:02 - you know you you all can think about it
10:04 - and uh let me know
10:07 - um I'm going to go just say hi to
10:11 - everyone now in the live
10:13 - chat hey
10:15 - everybody okay cool so my pronunciation
10:17 - of no noemon is not so
10:20 - strange
10:24 - uh John B says are you sure you don't
10:26 - pronounce it as I Choose You noton Like
10:29 - it's a Pokemon that that's that's pretty
10:32 - funny my kids are really into Pokemon
10:34 - right now I'm going to have to tell them
10:36 - I'm going to have to make up some sort
10:37 - of dad joke about that and tell them
10:39 - later on and they probably have no idea
10:41 - what I'm talking about uh but they'll
10:44 - still laugh because they're good
10:55 - kids okay cool Kevin says that seems
10:58 - cool with both servers start you can
10:59 - test that the file upload actually
11:01 - creates a file uh without losing hot
11:03 - reloading while making changes yeah yeah
11:05 - actually that's um yeah that was exactly
11:08 - so right before I started the The Stream
11:11 - I was just testing it out uh
11:14 - and and that was like that was kind of
11:17 - like the deal breaker I was like wow
11:18 - that's that is really
11:22 - useful uh Rohan ask where's the file go
11:25 - okay and Kevin says it's in the uploads
11:27 - folder
11:31 - um yeah so the the file right now
11:36 - obviously is just saved locally uh but
11:39 - it'll be
11:40 - saved you know on our server at some
11:48 - point let's see okay so we have some
11:51 - some talk about the database here
11:54 - so yeah I'm I'm not sure what I'm not
11:58 - really sure what I'm going to use yet so
12:02 - what do you what do you all think looks
12:07 - like R says R
12:10 - rdbms all right I'm not familiar with
12:12 - that uh what what is that
12:18 - R okay bobic says
12:22 - Firebase okay cool yeah actually I've
12:24 - I've heard of Firebase have not used it
12:35 - uh so yeah I'm not anyway I'm still open
12:38 - I'm still open to it I was researching
12:41 - uh
12:41 - some okay so thank thank you uh it's
12:45 - relational database management
12:48 - system oh okay
12:51 - so relation okay so we're talking SQL
12:55 - versus nosql databases right is that so
12:59 - the squel being the relational
13:00 - relational
13:02 - database I think I get it now I get it
13:04 - I'm not like uh I very limited
13:07 - experience with databases uh basically
13:09 - just like troubleshooting a WordPress
13:11 - database if it gets messed up and that's
13:13 - that's the extent of my experience okay
13:16 - cool yeah I was kind of think of going
13:18 - with something like a nosql database uh
13:21 - since like my very limited database
13:23 - experience has been with SQL databases
13:26 - and with
13:27 - WordPress uh so I thought like hey well
13:30 - why don't I try you know try something
13:34 - like no sequel uh
13:36 - so I'm not really
13:40 - sure uh like I said I just I have no
13:43 - idea what direction to go with this uh
13:45 - so I'm open to um suggestions whatever I
13:48 - go with to just something really
13:51 - lightweight and simple to start out with
13:53 - I don't you know I don't need a lot for
13:55 - this project I think it would be better
13:56 - to start out with something simple uh
13:59 - just to get get used to it and um for
14:02 - later projects if I need to move move on
14:05 - to
14:05 - something uh a little bit more involved
14:08 - and that's
14:12 - cool okay cool
14:15 - uh Kevin uh sent me the link to a
14:19 - project uh that he did with a database
14:21 - so I
14:23 - am I'm going to copy that and check that
14:28 - out later on
14:31 - put it in my my list of things my big
14:35 - list of things
14:38 - pasted okay I figured out why my phone
14:40 - is falling over today now it's uh it's
14:44 - vibrating when I get messages and then
14:46 - after I get so many messages in a row it
14:49 - just vibrates right off of where I have
14:51 - it sitting so that's that's why
15:00 - and I need
15:01 - to this is already in there now so I
15:03 - don't need
15:05 - that I think we've used this already I
15:08 - don't need
15:10 - that we've used this we've used
15:14 - this okay we've basically done
15:20 - this okay clean up my my little copy and
15:24 - paste file
15:27 - there oh
15:29 - there we go now we have plenty of space
15:31 - let me know if the text uh is too small
15:33 - on this I think I left it the same size
15:36 - as I had it uh for the video
15:38 - yesterday uh but if it's too small I
15:42 - could uh definitely make it
15:46 - bigger um I did I saw one question in
15:49 - here that I I want to answer before I
15:51 - start the coding uh so I don't forget
15:55 - okay it was Tyler so Tyler asked the
15:58 - college near me just opened up a 24-week
16:00 - boot camp what's your opinion on
16:01 - colleges opening up boot camps do you
16:03 - think they are worth
16:05 - it uh I don't really know I don't I
16:08 - don't have experience with colleges
16:09 - opening up boot camps so my my
16:12 - experience with colleges in computer
16:14 - science in general has been uh they're
16:17 - usually
16:19 - behind so uh wherever the industry is
16:23 - they're like a couple years back at
16:25 - least
16:27 - um I don't I my guess that the reasons
16:31 - for that are just there's not really
16:32 - very much incentive for professors to
16:34 - stay on top of things right because the
16:37 - the way it's structured
16:40 - um you know you you set up your courses
16:42 - you get your course materials approved
16:45 - uh and then you can teach the class uh
16:48 - without necessarily having to update it
16:50 - that much um you get used to a certain
16:54 - textbook uh you have all your your tests
16:57 - and everything around there so it's just
16:59 - like this the way it's set up is it
17:01 - makes it really easy to keep teaching
17:03 - the same stuff over and over again and
17:05 - really difficult to try to do new stuff
17:08 - so having said that I would be a little
17:11 - skeptical of a boot camp put on by a
17:14 - university and I mean I work at a
17:16 - university so
17:18 - uh I'm I'm definitely not anti-
17:21 - University in general uh but I would be
17:23 - skeptical it would just depend on like
17:25 - who's actually doing the teaching and
17:26 - who's putting it on like is it
17:30 - are the people doing the teaching like
17:31 - people are actually building real stuff
17:34 - you know in the industry and you know
17:35 - Cutting Edge stuff and they're just kind
17:38 - of partnering with the university to
17:40 - have some
17:41 - credibility uh or is it actually like
17:45 - University professors that are putting
17:47 - this on uh and I'm not saying all
17:50 - universities are like that or all
17:51 - professors are teaching you know kind of
17:53 - older stuff uh
17:56 - but uh that's just been my experience
17:58 - just in general I mean there are
17:59 - definitely universities that are on The
18:01 - Cutting Edge like um near where where
18:03 - I'm at Carnegie melon is always is
18:06 - really good they're on The Cutting Edge
18:09 - uh tech companies hire people professors
18:11 - and graduates like right away from uh
18:14 - from carnegi melon all the time uh so I
18:17 - guess it just
18:19 - depends uh on the on the school but I
18:22 - would check if you can try to check out
18:23 - who the teachers are and uh see like do
18:26 - they have a GitHub profile what kind of
18:28 - stuff are they doing um that's what I
18:31 - would look at to determine you know whe
18:34 - whether or not it's worth
18:38 - it uh Ro Rohan says uh when I said there
18:43 - a couple of years behind he said try
18:45 - about a decade I was trying to be nice
18:48 - and uh I'm not like i' I've spoken with
18:51 - like some of the professors here at my
18:53 - University and basically like their
18:55 - mindset is um it's not really like
18:59 - possible for them to stay on The Cutting
19:00 - Edge and still keep up with like the the
19:03 - load of courses that they're expected to
19:05 - teach to be full-time Professor uh so
19:09 - instead like they're they act they're
19:11 - trying to just give them the
19:13 - fundamentals of computer science and not
19:16 - try to do any anything that's Cutting
19:17 - Edge
19:18 - so it may not even be their goal to try
19:22 - to teach new stuff you know they're just
19:24 - they're trying to teach them you know
19:25 - good logic and problem solving uh and
19:29 - that's cool and then they they do it in
19:31 - sometimes really old languages like they
19:34 - might use cobal here actually uh I know
19:38 - like at the University that I went to I
19:41 - did take one computer science course and
19:44 - it was in
19:46 - C++ uh so even and even really good
19:49 - courses use really old languages
19:51 - sometimes like the Harvard computer
19:52 - science ined computer science course
19:54 - starts out with C they do a lot of other
19:57 - languages too
19:59 - so uh anyway I'm
20:02 - just that's just kind of would be my
20:04 - reservations about about doing it so it
20:07 - could be really good I you just need to
20:09 - do a little bit of research on on who's
20:12 - teaching
20:21 - it okay I'm going to grab one more thing
20:24 - from the live chat to copy and paste
20:26 - here and then we'll get started
20:42 - okay John B says maybe go with a SQL uh
20:46 - sqlite
20:48 - database
20:50 - okay that's cool yeah like I said I I
20:53 - was kind of leaning towards a nosql
20:55 - database but I really don't have I I
20:58 - don't really know know enough about it
20:59 - to know what would be better so I'm I'm
21:01 - definitely uh relying uh on your
21:03 - suggestions
21:11 - here okay all right so let's get into
21:15 - it so first thing we're going to do I
21:18 - guess is
21:21 - um maybe we'll try to send the email
21:24 - that seems like a better thing to do if
21:27 - uh if I can't do everything during the
21:29 - stream it makes more sense to do the
21:31 - email thing during the stream than to do
21:34 - the uh send it to project management
21:37 - because like for the use case of sending
21:40 - an email that's really really common so
21:42 - it will probably be useful to more
21:43 - people watching this or watching the
21:45 - recording uh I don't know how many
21:46 - people use our particular project
21:48 - management system so may not be as
21:51 - useful to learn the specifics of that
21:54 - particular API so I mean ideally I'd do
21:57 - them both uh on a stream but it may not
22:01 - work out like that so let's just try to
22:02 - do the email thing first uh I have
22:06 - used let's see what am I using right now
22:09 - let me check on my other screen I have
22:11 - the file
22:13 - uh I have it's a private repository
22:16 - right now so I can't share it because
22:18 - there's some API keys and things
22:22 - um I don't want to see what I'm using
22:25 - because I think I'm I think I'm using
22:26 - email Js
22:30 - I'm pretty sure that's what I
22:34 - used so let me know if you all have any
22:37 - uh email uh clients that you really like
22:40 - let me know like I said I'm currently
22:42 - using email JS where is it
22:45 - at H I try I even tried to clean up all
22:48 - my tabs in Windows uh before the stream
22:52 - and it's still like um a lot of stuff
22:59 - look I just have a lot of GitHub stuff
23:01 - open and it all looks the same you it's
23:02 - all just a bunch of code when I go
23:07 - in all right well I'm just going to go
23:10 - into
23:11 - my GitHub profile and find it again and
23:15 - that will be faster
23:37 - I feel legit now that I have so many
23:39 - repositories that I'm using the
23:41 - repository search function on
23:45 - GitHub uh so I don't know that makes me
23:48 - feel like hey you got a lot of stuff on
23:55 - here there we go I I couldn't remember
23:57 - what I named the the original
23:59 - repository so and this one's I'm really
24:03 - glad this is a private repository cuz
24:05 - it's a mess I don't want anybody to see
24:17 - it all right let's
24:24 - see yeah and it's really like the
24:26 - organization of this Repository it's
24:29 - just it's really I don't I don't even
24:32 - like to look at it it's making me feel
24:34 - bad just looking at it right
24:39 - now but this was
24:42 - um I think I I started working on this
24:46 - almost two years ago so I've come a long
24:50 - way all right so basically like sorry I
24:54 - can't show you this but I don't want to
24:55 - show my API keys to the world um
24:59 - um but all I'm doing is just trying to
25:02 - find my API keys for the email and
25:06 - verify that I am actually using the
25:09 - email system that I think I'm
25:13 - using also I'd like to see the format
25:17 - that I'm sending this data in
25:21 - currently and so my old project I was
25:24 - using Ajax there we go
25:31 - okay all right so I'm
25:34 - using it looks like I'm using email
25:38 - JS but it's going through send
25:42 - grid the reason I went with email JS is
25:45 - because I needed something that worked
25:46 - client side it was just like I had no
25:49 - access to any backend
25:51 - stuff and uh so anything I did had to be
25:54 - client side uh so email JS ended up
25:57 - being the only thing I could find that
25:59 - would let me send things client
26:02 - side so I don't need to keep using it I
26:06 - could
26:09 - probably I could probably just use send
26:11 - grid directly
26:39 - okay okay maybe I don't even have a key
26:42 - I can't let's let's look at email JS uh
26:45 - in case you're not familiar with it
27:02 - okay this is how
27:04 - to
27:12 - Temp okay yeah so this is It's I'm sorry
27:15 - I'm this is all coming back to me now I
27:16 - said this up a while ago um yeah so this
27:20 - was a way for me to get around uh so
27:23 - like send grid would not let me send um
27:25 - emails uh client side so this was like a
27:28 - work around for that where I don't even
27:31 - actually send um any API keys or
27:34 - anything you just liter it's just this
27:37 - like it's this simple and then the
27:41 - actual uh information for the send grid
27:44 - API is saved uh you know on the on the
27:48 - site so I'd log in and have that there
27:50 - and then I can build uh my email
27:53 - template within
27:55 - this okay
27:59 - so I probably won't need to do this
28:01 - anymore so I might just cut this out
28:03 - because this is just one more step in
28:04 - the process that's not
28:06 - necessary uh so I really I did like this
28:10 - this works really
28:12 - well uh but don't really need
28:21 - it so I guess I'm going to go straight
28:25 - with with srid
28:29 - so I have to let's look up their
28:31 - documentation
28:52 - then all right let's check out awesome
28:56 - so there's a s grid uh nodejs client
29:03 - awesome so we'll
29:09 - check okay
29:18 - cool okay not bad it's not like super up
29:21 - to date but uh it's you know within the
29:23 - last year they've updated this so this
29:27 - looks promising
29:57 - see for
30:28 - okay let's just try to do something
30:30 - basic just to see you know what we can
30:32 - send
30:49 - so all right so first things first uh
30:52 - let's add s grid to our
30:56 - project and I'll be I'll be bringing
30:58 - their documentation back and forth uh as
31:02 - as we need
31:11 - it
31:16 - okay so we're just adding send grid to
31:18 - our
31:24 - project all right while that's working
31:26 - I'll check the live chat
31:46 - okay uh back to the uh coding boot camp
31:48 - thing Tyler says completely agree with
31:51 - you and regard that most colleges are
31:52 - behind in terms of computer science but
31:54 - looking at the curriculum of this it
31:55 - seems pretty solid they teach M Stack
31:57 - and even jump into angular and
32:00 - Firebase can't find out who's teaching
32:03 - but it's hard situation to jump into
32:05 - considering it's 10K okay sounds like
32:07 - they work with Trinity never heard of
32:09 - them okay yeah I mean that is cool that
32:13 - they're obviously using some newer stuff
32:16 - um but yeah 10K
32:19 - that's like just to put it in
32:21 - perspective as far as 10K like I when
32:25 - when you count like the scholarships and
32:27 - Grant and stuff that I got I didn't pay
32:29 - 10K for my entire bachelor's degree so
32:33 - and that's probably even if you include
32:35 - uh everything I had to pay for books so
32:39 - 10K for a coding boot camp where you're
32:41 - not you're not even going to get a a
32:45 - degree that's a lot so I mean I would
32:50 - want I don't know for me to do it I
32:53 - would have to have some serious proof
32:55 - that this is going to be awesome and and
32:58 - that companies are going to recognize
33:01 - how how good this is on a
33:03 - resume um that you're going to I get
33:06 - like build things that are really great
33:08 - for your portfolio that that is that's
33:10 - just like that's a lot of money like who
33:13 - has 10K to just do that you know I mean
33:16 - normally like people take out a loan for
33:19 - that and stuff so it's going to be more
33:20 - than 10K when you end up paying it all
33:23 - back uh yeah that's just a lot um
33:33 - wow yeah I mean I guess it depends on
33:36 - where you're where you're at too like if
33:38 - if you have the money and that's cool go
33:40 - ahead I'd be really wary of doing that
33:42 - if I had to
33:43 - borrow
33:46 - um yeah I mean just check out there's
33:49 - just there's so many other options that
33:51 - are less expensive that potentially
33:54 - could work out I mean depending on what
33:57 - kind of learner you are
34:08 - are
34:22 - okay okay cool awesome uh so um Kevin
34:27 - you like guessed what I was thinking a
34:29 - minute ago uh so I was looking at this
34:34 - and I'm sure obviously you all saw it
34:36 - was on the screen I was just kind of
34:38 - going through this and looking and what
34:40 - it was what I was
34:41 - thinking was wow look at all these Vees
34:44 - they need to be con and look at all
34:46 - these
34:47 - semicolons and uh so Kevin wrote in the
34:51 - live chat here Jesse if you copy code
34:54 - with a lot of semicolons and ver you can
34:58 - uh use npm run lint to autofix some code
35:02 - styling issues
35:05 - so exactly what I was
35:09 - thinking I guess it's not I mean it's
35:11 - not really a big deal I can always just
35:13 - use like control fine and get rid of
35:15 - stuff but uh that was that was cool that
35:17 - you like you knew you knew what it was
35:20 - going through my mind when I saw
35:23 - that I wonder if projects like because
35:26 - I've I've been seeing a a lot like
35:29 - trying to look through different things
35:30 - for file uploads and email things uh
35:33 - I've seen a lot of the documentation
35:35 - uses this I wonder if that would be a
35:38 - good opportunity to get some pool
35:40 - requests in to just switch the examples
35:43 - to use even just to use const I mean you
35:46 - know we leave the semicolons alone to
35:49 - not bring up the whole debate over
35:50 - whether or not you should use them
35:52 - but uh I don't know maybe updating it a
35:55 - bit just to use es6 six because that's I
35:59 - mean even like browsers support cons
36:02 - like right out off the bat right don't I
36:05 - don't really know I mean cuz I always
36:06 - use a
36:08 - transpiler
36:10 - um but it's just so common
36:14 - now you would think like you may as well
36:18 - just you know switch over to
36:22 - it all right
36:29 - let's let's try this
36:34 - out so
36:41 - within let's
36:45 - require let's just require a s grid
37:07 - so I'm not going to copy over
37:11 - everything uh because a lot of the stuff
37:13 - they have their uh actually I might need
37:20 - to yeah I'll need to copy more at first
37:23 - I thought they were just saving a lot of
37:26 - things to variables and using them later
37:27 - but they're not they're actually
37:28 - creating like
37:31 - uh like new new helpers and stuff so
37:35 - okay so have the copy more
37:48 - over okay
37:58 - all right I guess I'll just copy the
38:00 - whole
38:02 - thing copy the whole thing and
38:05 - then uh we can rearrange it uh as
38:10 - needed
38:14 - so let's run that what was that what I
38:17 - need to
38:20 - run lint
38:23 - okay let's see
38:53 - actually I'm not sure that that that
38:55 - went over our server did
39:02 - it yeah it did okay it did first Why
39:05 - didn't
39:08 - it okay not really sure what happened
39:10 - but not a big deal let's just change
39:13 - them
39:30 - okay so anyway I see in the live chat so
39:32 - Tyler I see um like the conversation is
39:34 - still going on about the boot camp I'll
39:36 - come back to that uh whenever my timer
39:38 - is up here so I haven't haven't forgot
39:41 - about it
39:43 - um I'm just want to get try some stuff
39:46 - out here okay so let's see what we
39:51 - have two email
39:54 - from all right so let's change this to
39:57 - my email so I can get the
40:11 - email all right so we have I'll leave
40:13 - the subject and content as is now but
40:16 - we'll see if it ends up being a pain I'm
40:18 - definitely changing this uh this
40:21 - content so right right now it says
40:23 - sending with send GD is fun and easy to
40:26 - do anywhere
40:27 - uh
40:29 - so may not be true we'll
40:36 - see all right yeah I'll leave it like
40:38 - that I I just want to make sure it sends
40:40 - first if we can get it to send then I'll
40:42 - actually make the content be you know
40:44 - what we're collecting from this form
40:58 - okay and this part of it I guess is what
41:02 - wait which part I actually
41:06 - send okay this is the part that actually
41:09 - sends
41:13 - it yeah so
41:16 - let's let's put this part
41:20 - inside
41:24 - here cuz this is where we're going to
41:26 - end up it doing this anyway uh so we'll
41:30 - just put it inside here for now uh at
41:33 - some point maybe we'll want to clean
41:34 - this up
41:36 - cuz this this uh server.js is going to
41:40 - end up being pretty long uh once we do
41:42 - everything that we're probably going to
41:44 - need to do but for now I'm
41:48 - not not going to worry about it so we
41:52 - need an API
41:54 - key so let me
41:58 - let me log into my S grid account on my
42:00 - other
42:21 - screen let see
42:31 - all right so I'm going to make a new API
42:35 - key just for
42:37 - testing actually I might let's see
42:41 - access
42:57 - okay the way uh you can customize the
43:01 - access that the API key
43:03 - has
43:11 - um actually let's see so uh this would
43:14 - be a good time for me to learn this so I
43:16 - know that normally when you have API
43:19 - Keys like this you want to put them in a
43:21 - separate file that doesn't get sync to
43:22 - your repo uh and then you just pull um
43:26 - those environment
43:28 - variables uh from there so that's what I
43:32 - want to
43:33 - do uh but I actually have never done
43:36 - that before uh because normally
43:39 - it's like I'm not collaborating with
43:42 - people on projects so I just have
43:43 - private repos and it doesn't really
43:45 - matter about the keys so let's do that
43:49 - uh so normally it's like a m
43:52 - file I think that's let's um
43:59 - let's check this out
44:19 - uh all right so on my other screen I
44:23 - just brought up
44:27 - how to do this
45:06 - okay so let's first make sure m is in
45:09 - our yeah
45:23 - okay so it's already in there so we
45:29 - good although actually I wonder if these
45:33 - files are already being used by
45:36 - um create react
45:45 - app Maybe
46:18 - okay all right so let me bring this
46:21 - over let everyone see what I'm working
46:24 - on okay so as I said all all I'm trying
46:27 - to do is have a file where I can put the
46:29 - API keys that I need to use so that we
46:31 - can work on this and I can put it on
46:34 - YouTube and not have to worry about uh
46:36 - giving out any API
46:39 - keys
46:40 - so this is saying I need to install M if
46:45 - I don't already have it which I might
46:48 - I'm not
46:50 - sure uh are we using this
47:00 - okay maybe not don't have it so I can do
47:05 - this and store
47:13 - my content so sample inre store in a m
47:22 - file and just put the keys in there
47:31 - all right does that seem like the way
47:33 - it's supposed it's already set up okay
47:35 - cool that all right that's what I was
47:37 - wondering so Patrick says it's already
47:39 - set up I yeah I was hoping you would say
47:44 - that and I I kind of thought
47:46 - um that you might have done that just
47:48 - put it on INF I set that up to work in
47:51 - server JS
47:52 - awesome okay cool thank you Patrick
48:03 - all right so I don't need
48:07 - this Patrick already set it up so
48:09 - basically I just need uh the N file and
48:14 - we're good we're good to
48:17 - go cool and actually now that you say
48:20 - that did you put something in GitHub
48:22 - already explaining that to me and I just
48:25 - forgot it already even though I read it
48:27 - this
48:32 - morning if if that's so sorry about
48:36 - that all right well anyway my my timer
48:39 - just stopped so I did say I'd go back uh
48:41 - so I do want to answer uh some of the
48:45 - questions that were just in there
48:47 - so five minute break going to answer
48:49 - some stuff in the live chat we'll come
48:51 - back to it we'll set up our API Keys uh
48:54 - and test out mailing with send
49:05 - okay so to go back to I I want to go
49:08 - back to this conversation we're having
49:09 - about coding boot camps because I mean I
49:11 - imagine this might be a useful to uh
49:14 - thing to talk
49:15 - about um for people who uh who watch
49:18 - this so uh Tyler says I agree Jesse
49:22 - $10,000 is a lot to me does name
49:25 - recognition mean anything uh
49:28 - the um is considered a top School uh so
49:31 - I'm probably University
49:35 - of yeah what is what
49:38 - is we is this like
49:42 - Minnesota or
49:44 - not so I'm not
49:49 - sure uh is well anyway it's considered a
49:52 - top School uh and it's highly recognized
49:55 - by local employers so that's another
49:57 - factor I was considering okay yeah well
49:59 - that's
50:01 - what yeah take that into consideration
50:04 - so I think I'd mention like our our
50:06 - company's going to
50:08 - respect this you know boot camp
50:10 - certification or whatever you know
50:12 - you're going to get when you do the boot
50:13 - camp and if the answer is yes then
50:16 - that's awesome and that's you know
50:18 - another reason maybe why you should do
50:20 - it uh of course that depends on like
50:23 - what company do you want to work at and
50:25 - does that company recognize it or not uh
50:29 - so that that really depends on what what
50:32 - you want to
50:40 - do oh wow John B said uh Internet
50:43 - Explorer 11 supports cons so wow I
50:46 - didn't even realize it went that far
50:48 - back so that's that's really cool
51:04 - okay and Patrick brought up uh so the
51:06 - boot camp will probably be partnering
51:08 - with local businesses to help you find a
51:11 - job so uh yeah that's that's actually a
51:15 - good point you maybe check into to what
51:18 - what they have like what kind of help
51:19 - they'll actually give you to try to find
51:22 - a job you know after you complete the
51:24 - boot camp that might be really valuable
51:26 - maybe if there's any numbers about like
51:28 - how many people actually find jobs you
51:30 - know within let's say like six months
51:32 - after completing it if the percentage is
51:35 - really
51:36 - high then it then it could be worth it I
51:39 - mean then it could be a good investment
51:40 - where you could say like okay I'm going
51:41 - to spend 10,000 now but within a year
51:44 - I'm going to have a job with the salary
51:46 - that's probably going to be I don't know
51:48 - way way more than that uh so it could be
51:51 - worth it
52:05 - okay uh Kevin asks any ideas on how to
52:08 - get some title or experience in Colombia
52:11 - if I just graduated in an unrelated
52:13 - engineering
52:17 - degree
52:19 - um I I would
52:22 - say you could do a few things
52:25 - so obviously like build up you got to
52:28 - build up your
52:29 - portfolio um and you'll probably build
52:33 - up like your reputation in the
52:36 - industry
52:37 - uh possibly the quickest way is if you
52:40 - could contribute to some open source
52:43 - projects that are
52:44 - popular uh then you might get more
52:50 - attention uh from from companies who use
52:52 - that
52:54 - product uh
52:56 - also like
52:58 - freelancing is a good way to make money
53:00 - and build your portfolio at the same
53:02 - time as long as you can find projects
53:04 - that are good sometimes there's a lot of
53:06 - freelancing jobs out there that aren't
53:09 - really going to challenge your skills or
53:11 - be that impressive in your portfolio so
53:12 - that's good to pay the bills but might
53:15 - not even want to put it on your
53:17 - portfolio um
53:20 - so that that would be
53:23 - my what I would say I mean it depends on
53:26 - what's going on where you're at if there
53:28 - are different coding meetups or
53:30 - conferences or things that you could go
53:33 - to that's a good way to network uh and
53:37 - just have
53:38 - people you know get get to know who you
53:41 - are and what's your what you're into
53:43 - what projects you're working on uh and
53:46 - then that might be an end so if you you
53:49 - meet somebody from a company and then
53:51 - you you find out there's a job open then
53:54 - you could get in touch with with that
53:57 - person let them know you're going to
53:59 - apply they could put in a good word that
54:02 - really goes a long
54:04 - way uh for for getting hired because
54:08 - it's a big decision to hire somebody and
54:10 - if if somebody you know inside your
54:12 - organization that you already trust can
54:14 - vouch for them and say yeah you know I
54:16 - know this guy he's he's a good guy he
54:18 - knows what he's talking about that could
54:20 - that could help
54:21 - so anyway all those things will probably
54:25 - help uh can't really say if any one of
54:28 - them will be the thing that that really
54:31 - you know gets you to where you want to
54:32 - be uh but just working like a little bit
54:35 - at a time you know as you can on on all
54:38 - of them will be uh
54:40 - probably a a pretty like a pretty sure
54:43 - plan that at some point you know you'll
54:47 - you'll build up your reputation you know
54:49 - get a uh get a decent job
55:04 - okay uh so I'm going to get back to this
55:06 - and I just saw Patrick wrote so dot and
55:09 - so uh comes with create react app uh and
55:14 - so Patrick just required it in server
55:16 - Dodge ass
55:18 - okay I like I thought that I had seen it
55:21 - in in the pull request
55:25 - so let's
55:27 - see is it
55:29 - required yeah there we go so it was in
55:32 - there the whole time
55:36 - and I don't know I don't even have to
55:38 - say it anymore like I I look like an
55:40 - idiot so many times in this stream like
55:42 - it's not it should not be surprising to
55:44 - anyone
55:45 - anymore but uh that's how it is
55:52 - sometimes okay so Kevin said thanks for
55:54 - the advice um so he also said I'm
55:57 - awesome so I just I just wanted to read
55:59 - that part out since I just said that I
56:01 - look like an idiot so uh anyway thanks
56:05 - for saying that Kevin yeah I really hope
56:07 - that the uh you know some of that advice
56:09 - will be helpful to
56:11 - you um it's what did I read something
56:15 - the other day it was it was really funny
56:17 - I don't remember where it was at but it
56:19 - it was something
56:20 - like
56:23 - um like listening to
56:27 - like the a successful like founder of a
56:30 - startup company talk about how they did
56:33 - it is basically like listening to a
56:37 - lottery winner telling you what numbers
56:39 - they used uh so kind it was kind of
56:42 - funny a little bit extreme but it was
56:44 - funny because you're basically saying
56:46 - like you know there's so many things
56:48 - that go into
56:50 - success you can't really just follow
56:52 - exactly what someone else did so that's
56:54 - why it's somewhat hard to to give advice
56:58 - because I could say like well here's
57:00 - what worked for me that may or may not
57:02 - work because my situation and all the
57:05 - factors that went into you know what's
57:08 - happened to me are probably not going to
57:10 - be replicated so I I don't agree that
57:13 - it's exactly like a lottery I think you
57:15 - can you can take you know good things
57:18 - you know away from anybody's story uh
57:21 - but it just it was funny because it did
57:23 - kind of illustrate like yeah I mean you
57:27 - uh it's really hard to say like do this
57:29 - this and this and you can replicate
57:31 - someone's success uh but any I I think
57:35 - the advice that I gave is is pretty uh
57:38 - General enough that it can apply in a
57:40 - lot of different situations and uh
57:42 - possibly be uh be helpful so anyway but
57:45 - Kevin let me know how things are going
57:47 - too if you ever have any like more like
57:48 - specific questions or anything you know
57:51 - feel free to get in touch with me like
57:53 - on Twitter wherever uh and I'd be happy
57:55 - to help out like you've helped out me on
57:58 - so many of my projects like I'd be super
58:01 - happy to help you out with anything you
58:05 - need John B said an awesome idiot that's
58:10 - it uh yeah honestly like legitimately
58:15 - like I don't want to I get down on
58:17 - myself a lot I don't want you all to
58:19 - think that I really I don't really think
58:21 - I'm an idiot I just think I make silly
58:23 - mistakes sometimes on when I'm I'm
58:26 - recording so I actually have good
58:28 - self-esteem so so don't worry
58:32 - about that's why I can say that and
58:34 - still smile and be happy about it
58:36 - because I I really do uh have have
58:39 - decent self-esteem so uh I'm I'm not
58:44 - phased At All by messing up and calling
58:47 - myself an
58:49 - idiot okay so we already
58:53 - have uh thanks to Patrick we we have the
58:57 - M already
58:58 - required uh so that's great so we need
59:02 - to create the M
59:08 - file uh and
59:11 - then then I can pull in my API key that
59:14 - I was starting to set up on my other
59:17 - screen uh from send grid and that'll be
59:19 - cool because we'll need some API keys
59:22 - for at least one other thing we're going
59:25 - to do maybe more depending
59:28 - on how much we want to set
59:31 - up uh let me check the time as
59:35 - well okay uh let me I'm going to try to
59:39 - go as fast as I can to just do a test
59:42 - and get this working and then we'll do a
59:43 - question and answer and that
59:46 - way yeah CU I need maybe about like a
59:49 - half
59:50 - hour uh definitely want to try to wrap
59:52 - things up in about a half an
59:55 - hour for
60:36 - okay all right so when I set up where's
60:40 - my
60:47 - console so step one let's actually like
60:50 - create the
60:52 - file here we go okay so here's our file
60:58 - and I I'll I'll set up as much as I can
61:01 - without revealing the API key at some
61:02 - point I will have to move this to my
61:04 - other
61:12 - screen
61:15 - um what should I name this it'll be
61:20 - easiest trying to see what it's already
61:23 - there we go so what are they call on
61:28 - this send grid API
61:32 - key that's straightforward
61:43 - enough okay
61:48 - so
61:49 - basically at this point I'm going to
61:51 - move this over I'm going to put the API
61:54 - key in but just
61:56 - for for demonstration so this is what
61:59 - this is how you would set this up
62:01 - correct
62:04 - um let's
62:08 - see okay Patrick's just Patrick saying
62:12 - do Echo send grid API key equals your
62:16 - key Val
62:27 - oh okay so Patrick you I could just do
62:29 - that in the command line and it would it
62:31 - would put it in there for
62:34 - me but I'm like I could do it like this
62:36 - as well
62:47 - correct uh M mkar says Hey Jesse I'm
62:50 - watching from Sierra Leon first time to
62:52 - catch it live and I'm enjoying it
62:54 - awesome I'm glad you could uh you can
62:56 - catch this live uh that's uh that's
62:59 - really cool um thanks for watching
63:05 - so all right cool so let's let
63:09 - me
63:15 - move briefly I'm just going to move this
63:19 - over and then try to remember to never
63:23 - show it again so I don't have to change
63:26 - all my API Keys um and then now I'm
63:30 - going to go into send grid and set this
63:34 - up oops got to give it a name
64:09 - okay all right so we have our API
64:13 - key in
64:16 - ourn file so now this should give us the
64:21 - correct API
64:23 - key and
64:27 - let's see I want to double check to make
64:30 - sure I don't have to do anything else to
64:32 - make this work it looks like it's
64:34 - good
64:36 - yeah okay so that should be in terms of
64:39 - on on the srid uh admin panel uh that
64:43 - that should be everything I need to do
64:46 - uh so
64:51 - now I think we're
64:55 - I think we can do it I think we can try
65:00 - it all right so save
65:04 - this where we at let's go
65:09 - to
65:11 - 9,000 let's get rid of some of this
65:13 - stuff and I don't really
65:16 - need um actually I'm going to fill a
65:19 - little bit of this out just to CU I I
65:22 - don't think I
65:23 - demonstrated my awesome console log that
65:27 - I put in
65:31 - here uh also if you didn't see yesterday
65:34 - this if if you didn't see this in action
65:37 - we'll show that again so I'm going to
65:39 - submit
65:44 - and who lot of stuff going on here
65:50 - what a lot more stuff than I thought I'd
65:52 - have okay so anyway this is obviously
65:55 - like these are all our our keys and
65:58 - values uh for our uh all our inputs
66:02 - right and then what happened here
66:28 - so I'm not sure what all that
66:31 - is oh
66:34 - man now I know what it all is I did the
66:40 - call so uh anyway it worked I just got
66:44 - spammed with a ton of emails
66:46 - though because uh I put the actual uh
66:50 - the part of it that sends the email I
66:53 - put it in here
66:55 - forgetting that this goes through all
66:58 - the different um Fields so this ran for
67:02 - every field so anyway it
67:07 - works it works I got the emails I just
67:10 - need to not put it in
67:14 - there
67:18 - so uh let's see where would be a better
67:22 - place to put this
67:36 - I guess I could just put
67:40 - it anywhere within here will will run as
67:43 - soon as this is
67:46 - uh as soon as a post request is sent
67:50 - to uploads anything in here should want
67:53 - run right so if I put this in here it
67:56 - should
67:57 - work I'll just test
68:01 - it and I don't need to put anything in
68:04 - here let's just submit it should
68:07 - submit yeah Okay
68:11 - cool so yeah so that
68:13 - worked
68:15 - once awesome and I know on on my phone I
68:20 - I saw I got a ton of messages to my
68:23 - Gmail account
68:28 - so
68:32 - hopefully hopefully I didn't just
68:35 - like get my send grid account marked as
68:38 - spam by Gmail that would be bad
68:43 - uh let's see sorry if there was just a
68:46 - bunch of static I just had my phone
68:48 - right next to the mic I didn't even
68:49 - realize it so sorry about that okay cool
68:53 - so we have
69:00 - um the changes
69:04 - to um so anyway we've successfully sent
69:08 - an email using send grid uh from our
69:12 - server.js file uh on form
69:16 - submission we've set up a m file so that
69:19 - we can keep our API I key secret uh
69:23 - we're not committing that
69:26 - uh so we've added it to our get ignore
69:27 - file so uh we
69:32 - are we are being very sneaky and secret
69:36 - which is which is good for this um yeah
69:39 - so the next step would be which I'm not
69:41 - going to do the next step right now
69:42 - because I I've got to uh do a shorter
69:44 - stream today but the next step which may
69:47 - or may not be on Monday's stream
69:50 - depending on how much time I have to
69:52 - work on it uh is going to be not just
69:55 - sending this where's it
69:59 - at whatever we had whatever we were
70:01 - sending uh
70:04 - this uh default text which says send
70:08 - grid is fun sending a send grid is fun
70:11 - and easy to do anywhere and actually
70:13 - that was true this was pretty easy and
70:16 - fun so we'll leave it in there but what
70:18 - we're going to do is replace the subject
70:20 - and and the
70:23 - content with probably the subject will
70:27 - say something like uh
70:30 - submission uh received from and then the
70:33 - person's email address or to
70:37 - email it's going to be we're actually
70:39 - going to have two so it's going to be
70:42 - the email of our project manager and the
70:44 - email of the person who submitted it uh
70:48 - the from email will
70:50 - be I don't know probably our project
70:53 - manager's email uh
70:57 - and then the content will actually be
70:59 - all the values uh that were submitted in
71:01 - the form so everything that was put in
71:04 - there so that and that'll be it for the
71:06 - emails Next Step will then be uh hooking
71:09 - this up to our API and then after that
71:12 - potentially uh setting up some sort of
71:16 - database all right so I'll take this
71:19 - I'll I'll make sure that I
71:21 - um I push all this up to GitHub on the
71:26 - whatever what branch are we on
71:29 - um on the custom server Branch so we'll
71:32 - push it all up to custom server Branch
71:34 - uh so you'll be able obviously you can't
71:36 - test out the email unless you want to
71:38 - put in make your own send grid account
71:40 - and put in your own uh API key which I'm
71:44 - just using the free version right now
71:46 - which is plenty for for this uh so if
71:49 - you want to test it out there's a free
71:51 - version it's really easy to
71:53 - use okay now
71:57 - now
71:59 - let's let's go to the live chat actually
72:02 - Kevin said shouldn't it be form. on
72:08 - end let's
72:12 - see yeah
72:15 - probably Kevin you're probably right I'm
72:17 - just I'm not really familiar with uh how
72:20 - things work with formidable so I was
72:22 - reading their documentation but I didn't
72:23 - get very far through it uh before this
72:25 - video so uh that makes sense that that's
72:29 - what it would be so probably will move
72:39 - that so let
72:47 - me I'll I'll work on that actually yeah
72:49 - I want to get your questions so I'll
72:51 - work on that later on then uh
72:55 - if I get into that now then I'm never
72:58 - going to uh be able to get through the
73:00 - all the questions okay so now if uh if
73:03 - you're just interested in the code part
73:05 - uh that part is over I'm going to do
73:07 - some questions and answers now so
73:10 - um uh if you're going to quit watching
73:13 - at this point uh that's cool thanks for
73:15 - watching I'll be back on Monday uh
73:17 - otherwise if you have a question put it
73:18 - in the live chat now I'll do my best to
73:20 - get to all the questions if I happen to
73:22 - uh accidentally skip over your question
73:24 - or if you can't stick around to hear the
73:26 - answer uh please uh put it in the
73:28 - comments or direct message me on Twitter
73:31 - or some other social media
73:46 - platform okay so I've scrolled all the
73:49 - way up to the top of the chat so I'm
73:52 - going to try not to miss anything
74:07 - okay so uh Tyler we were talking about
74:10 - code boot camps and things and Tyler
74:12 - asks uh any specific recommendations in
74:15 - the midwest
74:17 - particularly
74:21 - um yeah I don't I don't know of anything
74:24 - in particular uh in the midwest so sorry
74:27 - I can't give it uh give you any advice
74:30 - in that area um Patrick says there's
74:34 - iron something in in Colorado let's
74:41 - see okay and it looks like if it was if
74:44 - it was iron yard they shut down yeah I
74:48 - remember seeing that on Twitter
75:07 - okay uh John B says general assembly
75:09 - seems to be the highest rated boot camp
75:11 - in Denver okay see I've never heard it
75:15 - I'm I'm not really that knowledgeable
75:17 - about which boot camps are good and
75:19 - which ones aren't so good uh so I've
75:22 - never uh done a boot camp myself
75:25 - so probably I'm not the best person to
75:27 - give advice uh my advice in regard to
75:31 - boot camps usually centers around return
75:34 - on investment so I do have a business
75:36 - degree and so my mind works a little bit
75:38 - in that way and that uh I would always
75:41 - be thinking what are the chances of me
75:43 - getting a job how much would it pay
75:46 - versus how much is this going to
75:49 - cost uh not only The Upfront cost but
75:52 - then the time you know the opportunity
75:55 - cost and how much time the boot camp is
75:57 - going to be versus how much you could
75:58 - make if you just been working so I would
76:01 - I would put that all into
76:03 - consideration uh even assuming that it
76:05 - actually was a good boot
76:20 - camp okay uh paddle says galvanized and
76:23 - touring are also made in Denver uh but
76:26 - they're 20K
77:05 - okay so looks like there is some
77:07 - discussions about some really old
77:09 - programming languages
77:12 - that I I have at least heard the names
77:16 - of these languages I know nothing about
77:18 - them
77:19 - though so they're naming uh
77:23 - Lotus mosaic
77:53 - links okay so Tyler did clarify what
77:56 - what I thought it was University of
77:58 - Minnesota so yeah I was I was wondering
78:01 - but uh then it hit me that like I do
78:03 - like there are people from all over the
78:05 - world so I'm assuming it's Minnesota but
78:07 - maybe like it's some University in
78:09 - another country and that I I had just
78:12 - had never heard of so I just wanted to
78:18 - clarify uh sand deep says and actually
78:21 - this was this was a little while ago so
78:23 - hopefully uh you're still um still
78:26 - watching but Sandeep says this is my
78:28 - first session do you think it'll be
78:30 - helpful for me uh I'm okay to put extra
78:33 - effort to understand old sessions um
78:38 - and Grim girl so gr RM n g RL uh says
78:44 - great question uh Sandy I'm in the same
78:47 - boat as you so hopefully you all are
78:50 - still still watching sorry I didn't see
78:52 - this earlier uh but I yeah I think that
78:57 - I hope at least that these can be
78:59 - helpful to people of all skill levels
79:02 - sometimes I go over uh topics that are a
79:05 - little bit more advanced it just depends
79:06 - on what I need to work on that day so on
79:10 - you know any given day things might be a
79:12 - little bit more advanced than than you
79:15 - might be used to or they might be like
79:17 - right at your level or even below it uh
79:20 - so it just depends on what I'm working
79:21 - on I do I try to have a mix of things
79:25 - so I think like maybe two days ago we
79:28 - were just doing some basic uh CSS things
79:32 - uh and the day we were doing the um
79:34 - YouTube ined uh
79:37 - so yeah it just depends and uh don't be
79:40 - afraid to ask questions either you know
79:43 - I I'll try to get to them when I can but
79:45 - then also there's so many people in the
79:47 - live chat that are really great at at
79:49 - helping out and answering questions as
79:51 - well uh so uh yeah I mean I definitely
79:55 - encourage you to um I don't know just
79:57 - try it out and see and if if you find
79:59 - that uh the streams aren't really that
80:01 - helpful at all to you then that's cool
80:04 - too uh and um you know feel free to
80:07 - suggest maybe some topics that would be
80:09 - more helpful to you and I'll see if I
80:11 - could either uh work them into my live
80:13 - streams with what I'm doing or maybe
80:16 - make uh another video like a a
80:18 - pre-recorded video on them at some point
80:53 - uh Rohan said uh everything I do uh
80:56 - would be onethird the time if I never
80:58 - made any mistakes so this is right
80:59 - around the time when I was uh calling
81:01 - myself an idiot uh for making uh silly
81:06 - mistakes uh so Patrick said we all make
81:09 - silly mistakes and uh Patrick also said
81:14 - in in response to Rohan that goes very
81:16 - well with how I estimate I break things
81:18 - down into small task estimate add them
81:20 - up together multiply by three that's
81:23 - really good advice actually it seems
81:25 - like projects always take way longer
81:28 - than you would estimate because well for
81:30 - two reasons one things not working right
81:33 - the first time you know Silly mistakes
81:35 - and then also scope
81:37 - Creed which I don't know if I said this
81:40 - yesterday but uh this project is already
81:42 - going to be bigger than I thought uh I
81:44 - got some information from a cooworker
81:47 - about some extra stuff that needs to be
81:49 - in this project so I'm
81:52 - expecting I'm expecting this to be more
81:55 - than what we originally thought so I'm
81:57 - not exactly sure how much more or what
81:59 - it's going to be like uh but it's going
82:02 - to be more hope like it might just end
82:04 - up being that we have a few extra views
82:07 - that we have to put in and some text
82:08 - content and that's it we'll
82:23 - see uh
82:27 - Yasser says Hey Jesse hey how's it going
82:29 - thanks for
82:32 - watching okay Pat all right sorry Pat I
82:35 - didn't see this earlier uh I guess uh
82:37 - Patrick says you should be hitting Local
82:39 - Host 3,000 now with the changes to the
82:42 - start
82:46 - script okay so so Patrick should I be
82:49 - able to do all the form stuff on Local
82:52 - Host 3000
82:55 - I thought the form stuff would only work
82:57 - on the uh Port
83:15 - 9000
83:16 - okay let me try this
83:20 - then so I do have 3,000 open let me do a
83:23 - refresh
83:30 - so let
83:43 - me let's make sure
83:48 - everything oh
83:50 - okay all right so I'm getting I'm
83:52 - getting this error this cores
83:55 - error
83:57 - uh from Local Host so at least like it
84:01 - it did look
84:08 - like okay so if I if I use 3,000 then I
84:12 - still get the hot reloading um of
84:15 - everything in react and then also the
84:17 - server so I just need then to adjust the
84:20 - core stuff to for this to work then
84:39 - um John B says uh in regard to having a
84:42 - business degree uh says I started off
84:44 - doing business it was too boring for me
84:46 - then moved into it Network
84:48 - Administration and then ported over to
84:50 - computer science with concentration in
84:52 - networking and data communication
84:55 - that's cool yeah I was
85:01 - um I I guess I liked business
85:06 - um in when I was in school I focused a
85:10 - lot on
85:11 - economics uh within you know within the
85:14 - business department so I really I did
85:15 - like
85:17 - economics I thought about going on and
85:19 - getting like further degrees in
85:21 - economics uh but then I just I didn't I
85:25 - got married and I promised my wife that
85:27 - she could get her master's degree while
85:29 - I worked and so that was that I I never
85:34 - uh went back uh to try to get another
85:36 - degree after that
85:39 - um but I did I liked it but I'll tell
85:42 - you what I didn't like so you know a lot
85:44 - of people with the business degrees go
85:45 - on to be a manager of a business so I
85:47 - tried being an assistant manager and I
85:50 - didn't really like that I
85:55 - I don't know I just I didn't like that
85:56 - part of it so I think the uh the part of
85:58 - business that's more
86:00 - like
86:04 - um I don't know I guess it's it's not
86:07 - dealing directly with managing people
86:09 - but the part that's dealing more with
86:11 - like uh numbers and trying to figure out
86:14 - like Trends and things I kind of like
86:17 - that a little bit
86:23 - better for
86:54 - okay so let's
86:56 - see so anyway Patrick's trying to um
86:59 - tell me how to get rid of this chors
87:03 - error if I understand correctly in here
87:06 - I need to do this and then that will
87:08 - allow everything right the problem was
87:11 - it was only allowing things on Port
87:15 - 9000 guess there's easy way to test it
87:18 - let's see if it
87:37 - I still getting that yeah try that no it
87:41 - didn't didn't work I keep an eye on the
87:45 - time okay um maybe I could try I got to
87:48 - the end of the chat in terms of the
87:50 - questions so maybe I can take a couple
87:51 - more minutes and just try to get this
87:53 - working before we the stream
87:56 - um let's see
88:32 - would I have to change something in here
88:52 - then yeah I guess
88:56 - okay yeah Kevin says I I should need to
88:58 - it should be something with this uh uh
89:01 - res
89:02 - header what was the message
89:42 - that's
89:50 - odd it says no header is present on the
89:53 - request requested
90:07 - resource oh okay uh Patrick saying he
90:11 - read that uh people have trouble with
90:13 - cores on Chrome while hitting Local
90:19 - Host and uh nuclear Nick says there's a
90:24 - Chrome extension for this okay cool I
90:26 - mean I guess I could try it on another
90:28 - browser uh
90:33 - quickly bring in Firefox
91:18 - okay I didn't get an error uh in Firefox
91:21 - so I mean this will um at at least this
91:24 - will let us know if it's just a chrome
91:25 - thing that we need to uh to work on and
91:28 - let's
91:37 - see which one screenshot yeah this is
91:40 - the file that we just sent the
91:46 - screenshot oh wait where did I go on did
91:49 - I go to the wrong thing dang it I did
91:52 - sorry about that I went to 9,000 I
91:54 - suppos to get a three so let's try that
92:02 - again all right let's give it a
92:04 - different file so what's this a
92:07 - screenshot of punch of code
92:20 - okay okay so it looks like I didn't get
92:23 - an error for that either let's
92:33 - see
92:39 - screenshot okay cool that
92:41 - worked all right so now at least we know
92:44 - it's something with chrome so I'll just
92:46 - have to figure out what's going
92:49 - on okay cool so uh nuclear Nick said
92:52 - it's a allow control allow origin is the
92:56 - extensions name for Chrome said it said
93:00 - I literally had this issue a few days
93:02 - ago and it was fine uh for Dev uh
93:06 - environment okay
93:08 - cool all right Patrick I see now you're
93:11 - telling me I typed the wrong thing in
93:32 - okay I will check
93:37 - out the uh the
93:43 - extension and see if we can get this
93:45 - working with
93:45 - [Music]
93:51 - chrome okay cool
93:56 - [Music]
93:58 - um all right yeah I got to wrap things
94:01 - up now
94:03 - so thanks uh thank you so much for
94:05 - watching and for helping out um not bad
94:09 - we
94:10 - accomplished pretty much like what we
94:12 - wanted to at least kind of like the
94:13 - minimum that we wanted to today uh in uh
94:16 - shorter than normal amount of
94:19 - time um
94:24 - let's see oh today's Friday okay so I'll
94:26 - be back Monday so um uh have a great
94:31 - weekend and I should be Monday might end
94:34 - up being an earlier stream as well I'll
94:36 - have to see
94:37 - what what's going on with meetings
94:40 - lately Mondays have been kind of busy
94:42 - with meetings so uh we'll see
94:45 - so I'll uh I'll let you know on Twitter
94:49 - uh about when I'm going to stream uh
94:52 - sometime Monday morning
94:54 - uh so um anyway until then uh have a
94:57 - great weekend

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse and uh today we're going to continue working on our handling our form data uh which eventually yesterday we finally got the uh file upload uh to work uh so it took a while uh but we kept at it and it worked out uh so was really happy about that uh going a little earlier than normal today uh so I'll um I'll have to finish up at uh finish this up in about an hour and a half so a little bit shorter than I've uh stream uh than I've been doing lately so probably the code portion will finish up in an hour and then after that we can do like a half hour uh question and answer uh and then um then we'll be uh done for for the day and for the weekend but uh we'll see how much we can get done with this uh I want to show you some of the changes so I had some pull requests and so we changed a bit if you want to look um in the repository let's see I'll bring let me bring over the uh files changed here so this would be easier to see what what actually changed so Patrick submitted a pool request I also get another pull request from Kevin uh but it ended up uh they were doing a lot of the same things uh so uh ended up just pulling in um uh Patrick's request cuz it had a few extra things and it was just a lot easier to pool in one than to try to merge uh so thank you to both of you uh for uh for submitting these so basically uh we have um nodon I I've read like so many different ways to pronounce this but I'm going to say node Monon so um so we have that now and uh that's going to uh like watch our new like custom server uh so that we can change stuff in our server and it'll Auto uh it should Auto reload um so we have a new some new things like in our scripts here uh so different ways we're starting the server and this actually now this start server gets called when we run start so the normal start command has a little bit extra on it now and uh what actually ends up having happening is it runs basically it runs our our normal server that we've been running uh for you know for since we started this project on Port 3000 and then it runs the other one that we just made yesterday on Port 9000 or whatever Port we set it to uh and that's kind of nice because yesterday we were like kind of having to manually start it now it's just one command it starts in both um and then that way we can go back and forth uh we still have all the benefits basically of of both of them really without any extra uh extra work so there's a lot of other stuff here you can see like a lot of um uh a lot of variables added uh which is nice and I'll definitely be probably have to add some more in as well when we start working with our apis uh but you can check more of that out if you if you want um let's see and Patrick also put in some explanation as well so that is available uh in the repository also I accidentally merged this into Master instead of custom server so our custom server branch and our Master Branch are now the same uh now I'm still going to do any new stuff in our custom server Branch but I don't know what I was thinking and I didn't realize it until um it didn't say that the pull request was merged and I'm like what the heck I know I merged this and then it hit me that I did it on the wrong Branch so after that I decided to get some caffeine um but other than that there's not really been not really any changes oh I did add one thing uh let me show you so this is where I ended up at basically I added this uh on um sorry I keep getting distracted I have my secondary stream on Instagram but for some reason my phone keeps falling down uh so I don't know why every other day it stays like perfectly where I want it but today it's it's falling down so anyway um so I added uh this this part here so I was just kind of looking through um the uh repository on uh GitHub for uh node formidable looking through their examples trying to see how they do things and uh I found this and I thought oh this will be cool at least we can see uh if all our fields are coming through uh and and how it looks so now we know that we can get all our Fields here and do what we need to with them uh within here so right now we're just logging them uh but this is basically what I want to work on uh today probably let's see I don't know I don't know if I'll do that much more with the with the uploads right now uh at some point I would like to add in I like some security features uh to let's say block out potentially uh malicious files so not sure if I want to get into that today or not uh I probably want to do a little bit more research uh I had added some things in in a previous project some security features but uh I could probably do uh a better job if I spent some more time uh researching it um so if any of you have any ideas or any experience with that you know please please let me know um but otherwise we're going to work on on handling this so we need to grab this we need to do a couple things with this this data uh so we need to email we need to send two emails uh one email to uh our our project manager uh here uh in my department and then we need to send another email to the user and then we need to send the data to our project management system through their API uh when we do that we're going to get some information back and that's going to include a project ID number and then we need to use that project ID number to send the files uh and attach them to that project I think that's all we need yeah I think that's all we need in uh the current version of this we're also sending data to a Google sheet but I don't know if I want to do that I may um I don't know I I'll think about that it's always nice to have another backup but I'm not sure if I want to uh I I kind of want to set up some sort of database to keep track instead of using the Google sheet it might be overkill for this project but i' it's something I'd like to learn how to do and will possibly be using in future project so it might not be a bad idea to try it on this project uh I'm I mean the this project has a very limited internal audience so the stakes are not very high let's say if if this crashed and I didn't do it right I mean I'm not saying but worst case scenario if it if it crashed and we lost a bunch of data all we'd have to do is just call up the people who submitted you know their requests and ask them to tell us what they wanted again right so I feel like it's better to try out something new on a project like this than to try it out on let's say something that you know an external audience would be using a lot more people would be using it would be more of a big deal if it messed up so let me know what you think about that I mean maybe I'm off with my reasoning here but uh so we'll see so we'll basically postpone the decision about whether or not to back up to a Google sheet to use a database or just to not do anything uh and we don't really need to make that decision now but just to let you know what I'm thinking and uh maybe you know you you all can think about it and uh let me know um I'm going to go just say hi to everyone now in the live chat hey everybody okay cool so my pronunciation of no noemon is not so strange uh John B says are you sure you don't pronounce it as I Choose You noton Like it's a Pokemon that that's that's pretty funny my kids are really into Pokemon right now I'm going to have to tell them I'm going to have to make up some sort of dad joke about that and tell them later on and they probably have no idea what I'm talking about uh but they'll still laugh because they're good kids okay cool Kevin says that seems cool with both servers start you can test that the file upload actually creates a file uh without losing hot reloading while making changes yeah yeah actually that's um yeah that was exactly so right before I started the The Stream I was just testing it out uh and and that was like that was kind of like the deal breaker I was like wow that's that is really useful uh Rohan ask where's the file go okay and Kevin says it's in the uploads folder um yeah so the the file right now obviously is just saved locally uh but it'll be saved you know on our server at some point let's see okay so we have some some talk about the database here so yeah I'm I'm not sure what I'm not really sure what I'm going to use yet so what do you what do you all think looks like R says R rdbms all right I'm not familiar with that uh what what is that R okay bobic says Firebase okay cool yeah actually I've I've heard of Firebase have not used it uh so yeah I'm not anyway I'm still open I'm still open to it I was researching uh some okay so thank thank you uh it's relational database management system oh okay so relation okay so we're talking SQL versus nosql databases right is that so the squel being the relational relational database I think I get it now I get it I'm not like uh I very limited experience with databases uh basically just like troubleshooting a WordPress database if it gets messed up and that's that's the extent of my experience okay cool yeah I was kind of think of going with something like a nosql database uh since like my very limited database experience has been with SQL databases and with WordPress uh so I thought like hey well why don't I try you know try something like no sequel uh so I'm not really sure uh like I said I just I have no idea what direction to go with this uh so I'm open to um suggestions whatever I go with to just something really lightweight and simple to start out with I don't you know I don't need a lot for this project I think it would be better to start out with something simple uh just to get get used to it and um for later projects if I need to move move on to something uh a little bit more involved and that's cool okay cool uh Kevin uh sent me the link to a project uh that he did with a database so I am I'm going to copy that and check that out later on put it in my my list of things my big list of things pasted okay I figured out why my phone is falling over today now it's uh it's vibrating when I get messages and then after I get so many messages in a row it just vibrates right off of where I have it sitting so that's that's why and I need to this is already in there now so I don't need that I think we've used this already I don't need that we've used this we've used this okay we've basically done this okay clean up my my little copy and paste file there oh there we go now we have plenty of space let me know if the text uh is too small on this I think I left it the same size as I had it uh for the video yesterday uh but if it's too small I could uh definitely make it bigger um I did I saw one question in here that I I want to answer before I start the coding uh so I don't forget okay it was Tyler so Tyler asked the college near me just opened up a 24week boot camp what's your opinion on colleges opening up boot camps do you think they are worth it uh I don't really know I don't I don't have experience with colleges opening up boot camps so my my experience with colleges in computer science in general has been uh they're usually behind so uh wherever the industry is they're like a couple years back at least um I don't I my guess that the reasons for that are just there's not really very much incentive for professors to stay on top of things right because the the way it's structured um you know you you set up your courses you get your course materials approved uh and then you can teach the class uh without necessarily having to update it that much um you get used to a certain textbook uh you have all your your tests and everything around there so it's just like this the way it's set up is it makes it really easy to keep teaching the same stuff over and over again and really difficult to try to do new stuff so having said that I would be a little skeptical of a boot camp put on by a university and I mean I work at a university so uh I'm I'm definitely not anti University in general uh but I would be skeptical it would just depend on like who's actually doing the teaching and who's putting it on like is it are the people doing the teaching like people are actually building real stuff you know in the industry and you know Cutting Edge stuff and they're just kind of partnering with the university to have some credibility uh or is it actually like University professors that are putting this on uh and I'm not saying all universities are like that or all professors are teaching you know kind of older stuff uh but uh that's just been my experience just in general I mean there are definitely universities that are on The Cutting Edge like um near where where I'm at Carnegie melon is always is really good they're on The Cutting Edge uh tech companies hire people professors and graduates like right away from uh from carnegi melon all the time uh so I guess it just depends uh on the on the school but I would check if you can try to check out who the teachers are and uh see like do they have a GitHub profile what kind of stuff are they doing um that's what I would look at to determine you know whe whether or not it's worth it uh Ro Rohan says uh when I said there a couple of years behind he said try about a decade I was trying to be nice and uh I'm not like i' I've spoken with like some of the professors here at my University and basically like their mindset is um it's not really like possible for them to stay on The Cutting Edge and still keep up with like the the load of courses that they're expected to teach to be fulltime Professor uh so instead like they're they act they're trying to just give them the fundamentals of computer science and not try to do any anything that's Cutting Edge so it may not even be their goal to try to teach new stuff you know they're just they're trying to teach them you know good logic and problem solving uh and that's cool and then they they do it in sometimes really old languages like they might use cobal here actually uh I know like at the University that I went to I did take one computer science course and it was in C++ uh so even and even really good courses use really old languages sometimes like the Harvard computer science ined computer science course starts out with C they do a lot of other languages too so uh anyway I'm just that's just kind of would be my reservations about about doing it so it could be really good I you just need to do a little bit of research on on who's teaching it okay I'm going to grab one more thing from the live chat to copy and paste here and then we'll get started okay John B says maybe go with a SQL uh sqlite database okay that's cool yeah like I said I I was kind of leaning towards a nosql database but I really don't have I I don't really know know enough about it to know what would be better so I'm I'm definitely uh relying uh on your suggestions here okay all right so let's get into it so first thing we're going to do I guess is um maybe we'll try to send the email that seems like a better thing to do if uh if I can't do everything during the stream it makes more sense to do the email thing during the stream than to do the uh send it to project management because like for the use case of sending an email that's really really common so it will probably be useful to more people watching this or watching the recording uh I don't know how many people use our particular project management system so may not be as useful to learn the specifics of that particular API so I mean ideally I'd do them both uh on a stream but it may not work out like that so let's just try to do the email thing first uh I have used let's see what am I using right now let me check on my other screen I have the file uh I have it's a private repository right now so I can't share it because there's some API keys and things um I don't want to see what I'm using because I think I'm I think I'm using email Js I'm pretty sure that's what I used so let me know if you all have any uh email uh clients that you really like let me know like I said I'm currently using email JS where is it at H I try I even tried to clean up all my tabs in Windows uh before the stream and it's still like um a lot of stuff look I just have a lot of GitHub stuff open and it all looks the same you it's all just a bunch of code when I go in all right well I'm just going to go into my GitHub profile and find it again and that will be faster I feel legit now that I have so many repositories that I'm using the repository search function on GitHub uh so I don't know that makes me feel like hey you got a lot of stuff on here there we go I I couldn't remember what I named the the original repository so and this one's I'm really glad this is a private repository cuz it's a mess I don't want anybody to see it all right let's see yeah and it's really like the organization of this Repository it's just it's really I don't I don't even like to look at it it's making me feel bad just looking at it right now but this was um I think I I started working on this almost two years ago so I've come a long way all right so basically like sorry I can't show you this but I don't want to show my API keys to the world um um but all I'm doing is just trying to find my API keys for the email and verify that I am actually using the email system that I think I'm using also I'd like to see the format that I'm sending this data in currently and so my old project I was using Ajax there we go okay all right so I'm using it looks like I'm using email JS but it's going through send grid the reason I went with email JS is because I needed something that worked client side it was just like I had no access to any backend stuff and uh so anything I did had to be client side uh so email JS ended up being the only thing I could find that would let me send things client side so I don't need to keep using it I could probably I could probably just use send grid directly okay okay maybe I don't even have a key I can't let's let's look at email JS uh in case you're not familiar with it okay this is how to Temp okay yeah so this is It's I'm sorry I'm this is all coming back to me now I said this up a while ago um yeah so this was a way for me to get around uh so like send grid would not let me send um emails uh client side so this was like a work around for that where I don't even actually send um any API keys or anything you just liter it's just this like it's this simple and then the actual uh information for the send grid API is saved uh you know on the on the site so I'd log in and have that there and then I can build uh my email template within this okay so I probably won't need to do this anymore so I might just cut this out because this is just one more step in the process that's not necessary uh so I really I did like this this works really well uh but don't really need it so I guess I'm going to go straight with with srid so I have to let's look up their documentation then all right let's check out awesome so there's a s grid uh nodejs client awesome so we'll check okay cool okay not bad it's not like super up to date but uh it's you know within the last year they've updated this so this looks promising see for okay let's just try to do something basic just to see you know what we can send so all right so first things first uh let's add s grid to our project and I'll be I'll be bringing their documentation back and forth uh as as we need it okay so we're just adding send grid to our project all right while that's working I'll check the live chat okay uh back to the uh coding boot camp thing Tyler says completely agree with you and regard that most colleges are behind in terms of computer science but looking at the curriculum of this it seems pretty solid they teach M Stack and even jump into angular and Firebase can't find out who's teaching but it's hard situation to jump into considering it's 10K okay sounds like they work with Trinity never heard of them okay yeah I mean that is cool that they're obviously using some newer stuff um but yeah 10K that's like just to put it in perspective as far as 10K like I when when you count like the scholarships and Grant and stuff that I got I didn't pay 10K for my entire bachelor's degree so and that's probably even if you include uh everything I had to pay for books so 10K for a coding boot camp where you're not you're not even going to get a a degree that's a lot so I mean I would want I don't know for me to do it I would have to have some serious proof that this is going to be awesome and and that companies are going to recognize how how good this is on a resume um that you're going to I get like build things that are really great for your portfolio that that is that's just like that's a lot of money like who has 10K to just do that you know I mean normally like people take out a loan for that and stuff so it's going to be more than 10K when you end up paying it all back uh yeah that's just a lot um wow yeah I mean I guess it depends on where you're where you're at too like if if you have the money and that's cool go ahead I'd be really wary of doing that if I had to borrow um yeah I mean just check out there's just there's so many other options that are less expensive that potentially could work out I mean depending on what kind of learner you are are okay okay cool awesome uh so um Kevin you like guessed what I was thinking a minute ago uh so I was looking at this and I'm sure obviously you all saw it was on the screen I was just kind of going through this and looking and what it was what I was thinking was wow look at all these Vees they need to be con and look at all these semicolons and uh so Kevin wrote in the live chat here Jesse if you copy code with a lot of semicolons and ver you can uh use npm run lint to autofix some code styling issues so exactly what I was thinking I guess it's not I mean it's not really a big deal I can always just use like control fine and get rid of stuff but uh that was that was cool that you like you knew you knew what it was going through my mind when I saw that I wonder if projects like because I've I've been seeing a a lot like trying to look through different things for file uploads and email things uh I've seen a lot of the documentation uses this I wonder if that would be a good opportunity to get some pool requests in to just switch the examples to use even just to use const I mean you know we leave the semicolons alone to not bring up the whole debate over whether or not you should use them but uh I don't know maybe updating it a bit just to use es6 six because that's I mean even like browsers support cons like right out off the bat right don't I don't really know I mean cuz I always use a transpiler um but it's just so common now you would think like you may as well just you know switch over to it all right let's let's try this out so within let's require let's just require a s grid so I'm not going to copy over everything uh because a lot of the stuff they have their uh actually I might need to yeah I'll need to copy more at first I thought they were just saving a lot of things to variables and using them later but they're not they're actually creating like uh like new new helpers and stuff so okay so have the copy more over okay all right I guess I'll just copy the whole thing copy the whole thing and then uh we can rearrange it uh as needed so let's run that what was that what I need to run lint okay let's see actually I'm not sure that that that went over our server did it yeah it did okay it did first Why didn't it okay not really sure what happened but not a big deal let's just change them okay so anyway I see in the live chat so Tyler I see um like the conversation is still going on about the boot camp I'll come back to that uh whenever my timer is up here so I haven't haven't forgot about it um I'm just want to get try some stuff out here okay so let's see what we have two email from all right so let's change this to my email so I can get the email all right so we have I'll leave the subject and content as is now but we'll see if it ends up being a pain I'm definitely changing this uh this content so right right now it says sending with send GD is fun and easy to do anywhere uh so may not be true we'll see all right yeah I'll leave it like that I I just want to make sure it sends first if we can get it to send then I'll actually make the content be you know what we're collecting from this form okay and this part of it I guess is what wait which part I actually send okay this is the part that actually sends it yeah so let's let's put this part inside here cuz this is where we're going to end up it doing this anyway uh so we'll just put it inside here for now uh at some point maybe we'll want to clean this up cuz this this uh server.js is going to end up being pretty long uh once we do everything that we're probably going to need to do but for now I'm not not going to worry about it so we need an API key so let me let me log into my S grid account on my other screen let see all right so I'm going to make a new API key just for testing actually I might let's see access okay the way uh you can customize the access that the API key has um actually let's see so uh this would be a good time for me to learn this so I know that normally when you have API Keys like this you want to put them in a separate file that doesn't get sync to your repo uh and then you just pull um those environment variables uh from there so that's what I want to do uh but I actually have never done that before uh because normally it's like I'm not collaborating with people on projects so I just have private repos and it doesn't really matter about the keys so let's do that uh so normally it's like a m file I think that's let's um let's check this out uh all right so on my other screen I just brought up how to do this okay so let's first make sure m is in our yeah okay so it's already in there so we good although actually I wonder if these files are already being used by um create react app Maybe okay all right so let me bring this over let everyone see what I'm working on okay so as I said all all I'm trying to do is have a file where I can put the API keys that I need to use so that we can work on this and I can put it on YouTube and not have to worry about uh giving out any API keys so this is saying I need to install M if I don't already have it which I might I'm not sure uh are we using this okay maybe not don't have it so I can do this and store my content so sample inre store in a m file and just put the keys in there all right does that seem like the way it's supposed it's already set up okay cool that all right that's what I was wondering so Patrick says it's already set up I yeah I was hoping you would say that and I I kind of thought um that you might have done that just put it on INF I set that up to work in server JS awesome okay cool thank you Patrick all right so I don't need this Patrick already set it up so basically I just need uh the N file and we're good we're good to go cool and actually now that you say that did you put something in GitHub already explaining that to me and I just forgot it already even though I read it this morning if if that's so sorry about that all right well anyway my my timer just stopped so I did say I'd go back uh so I do want to answer uh some of the questions that were just in there so five minute break going to answer some stuff in the live chat we'll come back to it we'll set up our API Keys uh and test out mailing with send okay so to go back to I I want to go back to this conversation we're having about coding boot camps because I mean I imagine this might be a useful to uh thing to talk about um for people who uh who watch this so uh Tyler says I agree Jesse $10,000 is a lot to me does name recognition mean anything uh the um is considered a top School uh so I'm probably University of yeah what is what is we is this like Minnesota or not so I'm not sure uh is well anyway it's considered a top School uh and it's highly recognized by local employers so that's another factor I was considering okay yeah well that's what yeah take that into consideration so I think I'd mention like our our company's going to respect this you know boot camp certification or whatever you know you're going to get when you do the boot camp and if the answer is yes then that's awesome and that's you know another reason maybe why you should do it uh of course that depends on like what company do you want to work at and does that company recognize it or not uh so that that really depends on what what you want to do oh wow John B said uh Internet Explorer 11 supports cons so wow I didn't even realize it went that far back so that's that's really cool okay and Patrick brought up uh so the boot camp will probably be partnering with local businesses to help you find a job so uh yeah that's that's actually a good point you maybe check into to what what they have like what kind of help they'll actually give you to try to find a job you know after you complete the boot camp that might be really valuable maybe if there's any numbers about like how many people actually find jobs you know within let's say like six months after completing it if the percentage is really high then it then it could be worth it I mean then it could be a good investment where you could say like okay I'm going to spend 10,000 now but within a year I'm going to have a job with the salary that's probably going to be I don't know way way more than that uh so it could be worth it okay uh Kevin asks any ideas on how to get some title or experience in Colombia if I just graduated in an unrelated engineering degree um I I would say you could do a few things so obviously like build up you got to build up your portfolio um and you'll probably build up like your reputation in the industry uh possibly the quickest way is if you could contribute to some open source projects that are popular uh then you might get more attention uh from from companies who use that product uh also like freelancing is a good way to make money and build your portfolio at the same time as long as you can find projects that are good sometimes there's a lot of freelancing jobs out there that aren't really going to challenge your skills or be that impressive in your portfolio so that's good to pay the bills but might not even want to put it on your portfolio um so that that would be my what I would say I mean it depends on what's going on where you're at if there are different coding meetups or conferences or things that you could go to that's a good way to network uh and just have people you know get get to know who you are and what's your what you're into what projects you're working on uh and then that might be an end so if you you meet somebody from a company and then you you find out there's a job open then you could get in touch with with that person let them know you're going to apply they could put in a good word that really goes a long way uh for for getting hired because it's a big decision to hire somebody and if if somebody you know inside your organization that you already trust can vouch for them and say yeah you know I know this guy he's he's a good guy he knows what he's talking about that could that could help so anyway all those things will probably help uh can't really say if any one of them will be the thing that that really you know gets you to where you want to be uh but just working like a little bit at a time you know as you can on on all of them will be uh probably a a pretty like a pretty sure plan that at some point you know you'll you'll build up your reputation you know get a uh get a decent job okay uh so I'm going to get back to this and I just saw Patrick wrote so dot and so uh comes with create react app uh and so Patrick just required it in server Dodge ass okay I like I thought that I had seen it in in the pull request so let's see is it required yeah there we go so it was in there the whole time and I don't know I don't even have to say it anymore like I I look like an idiot so many times in this stream like it's not it should not be surprising to anyone anymore but uh that's how it is sometimes okay so Kevin said thanks for the advice um so he also said I'm awesome so I just I just wanted to read that part out since I just said that I look like an idiot so uh anyway thanks for saying that Kevin yeah I really hope that the uh you know some of that advice will be helpful to you um it's what did I read something the other day it was it was really funny I don't remember where it was at but it it was something like um like listening to like the a successful like founder of a startup company talk about how they did it is basically like listening to a lottery winner telling you what numbers they used uh so kind it was kind of funny a little bit extreme but it was funny because you're basically saying like you know there's so many things that go into success you can't really just follow exactly what someone else did so that's why it's somewhat hard to to give advice because I could say like well here's what worked for me that may or may not work because my situation and all the factors that went into you know what's happened to me are probably not going to be replicated so I I don't agree that it's exactly like a lottery I think you can you can take you know good things you know away from anybody's story uh but it just it was funny because it did kind of illustrate like yeah I mean you uh it's really hard to say like do this this and this and you can replicate someone's success uh but any I I think the advice that I gave is is pretty uh General enough that it can apply in a lot of different situations and uh possibly be uh be helpful so anyway but Kevin let me know how things are going too if you ever have any like more like specific questions or anything you know feel free to get in touch with me like on Twitter wherever uh and I'd be happy to help out like you've helped out me on so many of my projects like I'd be super happy to help you out with anything you need John B said an awesome idiot that's it uh yeah honestly like legitimately like I don't want to I get down on myself a lot I don't want you all to think that I really I don't really think I'm an idiot I just think I make silly mistakes sometimes on when I'm I'm recording so I actually have good selfesteem so so don't worry about that's why I can say that and still smile and be happy about it because I I really do uh have have decent selfesteem so uh I'm I'm not phased At All by messing up and calling myself an idiot okay so we already have uh thanks to Patrick we we have the M already required uh so that's great so we need to create the M file uh and then then I can pull in my API key that I was starting to set up on my other screen uh from send grid and that'll be cool because we'll need some API keys for at least one other thing we're going to do maybe more depending on how much we want to set up uh let me check the time as well okay uh let me I'm going to try to go as fast as I can to just do a test and get this working and then we'll do a question and answer and that way yeah CU I need maybe about like a half hour uh definitely want to try to wrap things up in about a half an hour for okay all right so when I set up where's my console so step one let's actually like create the file here we go okay so here's our file and I I'll I'll set up as much as I can without revealing the API key at some point I will have to move this to my other screen um what should I name this it'll be easiest trying to see what it's already there we go so what are they call on this send grid API key that's straightforward enough okay so basically at this point I'm going to move this over I'm going to put the API key in but just for for demonstration so this is what this is how you would set this up correct um let's see okay Patrick's just Patrick saying do Echo send grid API key equals your key Val oh okay so Patrick you I could just do that in the command line and it would it would put it in there for me but I'm like I could do it like this as well correct uh M mkar says Hey Jesse I'm watching from Sierra Leon first time to catch it live and I'm enjoying it awesome I'm glad you could uh you can catch this live uh that's uh that's really cool um thanks for watching so all right cool so let's let me move briefly I'm just going to move this over and then try to remember to never show it again so I don't have to change all my API Keys um and then now I'm going to go into send grid and set this up oops got to give it a name okay all right so we have our API key in ourn file so now this should give us the correct API key and let's see I want to double check to make sure I don't have to do anything else to make this work it looks like it's good yeah okay so that should be in terms of on on the srid uh admin panel uh that that should be everything I need to do uh so now I think we're I think we can do it I think we can try it all right so save this where we at let's go to 9,000 let's get rid of some of this stuff and I don't really need um actually I'm going to fill a little bit of this out just to CU I I don't think I demonstrated my awesome console log that I put in here uh also if you didn't see yesterday this if if you didn't see this in action we'll show that again so I'm going to submit and who lot of stuff going on here what a lot more stuff than I thought I'd have okay so anyway this is obviously like these are all our our keys and values uh for our uh all our inputs right and then what happened here so I'm not sure what all that is oh man now I know what it all is I did the call so uh anyway it worked I just got spammed with a ton of emails though because uh I put the actual uh the part of it that sends the email I put it in here forgetting that this goes through all the different um Fields so this ran for every field so anyway it works it works I got the emails I just need to not put it in there so uh let's see where would be a better place to put this I guess I could just put it anywhere within here will will run as soon as this is uh as soon as a post request is sent to uploads anything in here should want run right so if I put this in here it should work I'll just test it and I don't need to put anything in here let's just submit it should submit yeah Okay cool so yeah so that worked once awesome and I know on on my phone I I saw I got a ton of messages to my Gmail account so hopefully hopefully I didn't just like get my send grid account marked as spam by Gmail that would be bad uh let's see sorry if there was just a bunch of static I just had my phone right next to the mic I didn't even realize it so sorry about that okay cool so we have um the changes to um so anyway we've successfully sent an email using send grid uh from our server.js file uh on form submission we've set up a m file so that we can keep our API I key secret uh we're not committing that uh so we've added it to our get ignore file so uh we are we are being very sneaky and secret which is which is good for this um yeah so the next step would be which I'm not going to do the next step right now because I I've got to uh do a shorter stream today but the next step which may or may not be on Monday's stream depending on how much time I have to work on it uh is going to be not just sending this where's it at whatever we had whatever we were sending uh this uh default text which says send grid is fun sending a send grid is fun and easy to do anywhere and actually that was true this was pretty easy and fun so we'll leave it in there but what we're going to do is replace the subject and and the content with probably the subject will say something like uh submission uh received from and then the person's email address or to email it's going to be we're actually going to have two so it's going to be the email of our project manager and the email of the person who submitted it uh the from email will be I don't know probably our project manager's email uh and then the content will actually be all the values uh that were submitted in the form so everything that was put in there so that and that'll be it for the emails Next Step will then be uh hooking this up to our API and then after that potentially uh setting up some sort of database all right so I'll take this I'll I'll make sure that I um I push all this up to GitHub on the whatever what branch are we on um on the custom server Branch so we'll push it all up to custom server Branch uh so you'll be able obviously you can't test out the email unless you want to put in make your own send grid account and put in your own uh API key which I'm just using the free version right now which is plenty for for this uh so if you want to test it out there's a free version it's really easy to use okay now now let's let's go to the live chat actually Kevin said shouldn't it be form. on end let's see yeah probably Kevin you're probably right I'm just I'm not really familiar with uh how things work with formidable so I was reading their documentation but I didn't get very far through it uh before this video so uh that makes sense that that's what it would be so probably will move that so let me I'll I'll work on that actually yeah I want to get your questions so I'll work on that later on then uh if I get into that now then I'm never going to uh be able to get through the all the questions okay so now if uh if you're just interested in the code part uh that part is over I'm going to do some questions and answers now so um uh if you're going to quit watching at this point uh that's cool thanks for watching I'll be back on Monday uh otherwise if you have a question put it in the live chat now I'll do my best to get to all the questions if I happen to uh accidentally skip over your question or if you can't stick around to hear the answer uh please uh put it in the comments or direct message me on Twitter or some other social media platform okay so I've scrolled all the way up to the top of the chat so I'm going to try not to miss anything okay so uh Tyler we were talking about code boot camps and things and Tyler asks uh any specific recommendations in the midwest particularly um yeah I don't I don't know of anything in particular uh in the midwest so sorry I can't give it uh give you any advice in that area um Patrick says there's iron something in in Colorado let's see okay and it looks like if it was if it was iron yard they shut down yeah I remember seeing that on Twitter okay uh John B says general assembly seems to be the highest rated boot camp in Denver okay see I've never heard it I'm I'm not really that knowledgeable about which boot camps are good and which ones aren't so good uh so I've never uh done a boot camp myself so probably I'm not the best person to give advice uh my advice in regard to boot camps usually centers around return on investment so I do have a business degree and so my mind works a little bit in that way and that uh I would always be thinking what are the chances of me getting a job how much would it pay versus how much is this going to cost uh not only The Upfront cost but then the time you know the opportunity cost and how much time the boot camp is going to be versus how much you could make if you just been working so I would I would put that all into consideration uh even assuming that it actually was a good boot camp okay uh paddle says galvanized and touring are also made in Denver uh but they're 20K okay so looks like there is some discussions about some really old programming languages that I I have at least heard the names of these languages I know nothing about them though so they're naming uh Lotus mosaic links okay so Tyler did clarify what what I thought it was University of Minnesota so yeah I was I was wondering but uh then it hit me that like I do like there are people from all over the world so I'm assuming it's Minnesota but maybe like it's some University in another country and that I I had just had never heard of so I just wanted to clarify uh sand deep says and actually this was this was a little while ago so hopefully uh you're still um still watching but Sandeep says this is my first session do you think it'll be helpful for me uh I'm okay to put extra effort to understand old sessions um and Grim girl so gr RM n g RL uh says great question uh Sandy I'm in the same boat as you so hopefully you all are still still watching sorry I didn't see this earlier uh but I yeah I think that I hope at least that these can be helpful to people of all skill levels sometimes I go over uh topics that are a little bit more advanced it just depends on what I need to work on that day so on you know any given day things might be a little bit more advanced than than you might be used to or they might be like right at your level or even below it uh so it just depends on what I'm working on I do I try to have a mix of things so I think like maybe two days ago we were just doing some basic uh CSS things uh and the day we were doing the um YouTube ined uh so yeah it just depends and uh don't be afraid to ask questions either you know I I'll try to get to them when I can but then also there's so many people in the live chat that are really great at at helping out and answering questions as well uh so uh yeah I mean I definitely encourage you to um I don't know just try it out and see and if if you find that uh the streams aren't really that helpful at all to you then that's cool too uh and um you know feel free to suggest maybe some topics that would be more helpful to you and I'll see if I could either uh work them into my live streams with what I'm doing or maybe make uh another video like a a prerecorded video on them at some point uh Rohan said uh everything I do uh would be onethird the time if I never made any mistakes so this is right around the time when I was uh calling myself an idiot uh for making uh silly mistakes uh so Patrick said we all make silly mistakes and uh Patrick also said in in response to Rohan that goes very well with how I estimate I break things down into small task estimate add them up together multiply by three that's really good advice actually it seems like projects always take way longer than you would estimate because well for two reasons one things not working right the first time you know Silly mistakes and then also scope Creed which I don't know if I said this yesterday but uh this project is already going to be bigger than I thought uh I got some information from a cooworker about some extra stuff that needs to be in this project so I'm expecting I'm expecting this to be more than what we originally thought so I'm not exactly sure how much more or what it's going to be like uh but it's going to be more hope like it might just end up being that we have a few extra views that we have to put in and some text content and that's it we'll see uh Yasser says Hey Jesse hey how's it going thanks for watching okay Pat all right sorry Pat I didn't see this earlier uh I guess uh Patrick says you should be hitting Local Host 3,000 now with the changes to the start script okay so so Patrick should I be able to do all the form stuff on Local Host 3000 I thought the form stuff would only work on the uh Port 9000 okay let me try this then so I do have 3,000 open let me do a refresh so let me let's make sure everything oh okay all right so I'm getting I'm getting this error this cores error uh from Local Host so at least like it it did look like okay so if I if I use 3,000 then I still get the hot reloading um of everything in react and then also the server so I just need then to adjust the core stuff to for this to work then um John B says uh in regard to having a business degree uh says I started off doing business it was too boring for me then moved into it Network Administration and then ported over to computer science with concentration in networking and data communication that's cool yeah I was um I I guess I liked business um in when I was in school I focused a lot on economics uh within you know within the business department so I really I did like economics I thought about going on and getting like further degrees in economics uh but then I just I didn't I got married and I promised my wife that she could get her master's degree while I worked and so that was that I I never uh went back uh to try to get another degree after that um but I did I liked it but I'll tell you what I didn't like so you know a lot of people with the business degrees go on to be a manager of a business so I tried being an assistant manager and I didn't really like that I I don't know I just I didn't like that part of it so I think the uh the part of business that's more like um I don't know I guess it's it's not dealing directly with managing people but the part that's dealing more with like uh numbers and trying to figure out like Trends and things I kind of like that a little bit better for okay so let's see so anyway Patrick's trying to um tell me how to get rid of this chors error if I understand correctly in here I need to do this and then that will allow everything right the problem was it was only allowing things on Port 9000 guess there's easy way to test it let's see if it I still getting that yeah try that no it didn't didn't work I keep an eye on the time okay um maybe I could try I got to the end of the chat in terms of the questions so maybe I can take a couple more minutes and just try to get this working before we the stream um let's see would I have to change something in here then yeah I guess okay yeah Kevin says I I should need to it should be something with this uh uh res header what was the message that's odd it says no header is present on the request requested resource oh okay uh Patrick saying he read that uh people have trouble with cores on Chrome while hitting Local Host and uh nuclear Nick says there's a Chrome extension for this okay cool I mean I guess I could try it on another browser uh quickly bring in Firefox okay I didn't get an error uh in Firefox so I mean this will um at at least this will let us know if it's just a chrome thing that we need to uh to work on and let's see which one screenshot yeah this is the file that we just sent the screenshot oh wait where did I go on did I go to the wrong thing dang it I did sorry about that I went to 9,000 I suppos to get a three so let's try that again all right let's give it a different file so what's this a screenshot of punch of code okay okay so it looks like I didn't get an error for that either let's see screenshot okay cool that worked all right so now at least we know it's something with chrome so I'll just have to figure out what's going on okay cool so uh nuclear Nick said it's a allow control allow origin is the extensions name for Chrome said it said I literally had this issue a few days ago and it was fine uh for Dev uh environment okay cool all right Patrick I see now you're telling me I typed the wrong thing in okay I will check out the uh the extension and see if we can get this working with chrome okay cool um all right yeah I got to wrap things up now so thanks uh thank you so much for watching and for helping out um not bad we accomplished pretty much like what we wanted to at least kind of like the minimum that we wanted to today uh in uh shorter than normal amount of time um let's see oh today's Friday okay so I'll be back Monday so um uh have a great weekend and I should be Monday might end up being an earlier stream as well I'll have to see what what's going on with meetings lately Mondays have been kind of busy with meetings so uh we'll see so I'll uh I'll let you know on Twitter uh about when I'm going to stream uh sometime Monday morning uh so um anyway until then uh have a great weekend
