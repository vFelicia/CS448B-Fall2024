00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:09 - with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're
00:13 - going to finish up what we started
00:15 - yesterday which was that faculty
00:17 - component and we pulled in some new data
00:21 - so I did just a little bit with it after
00:25 - yesterday's stream so it shouldn't be
00:28 - too hard to catch everyone up we've got
00:31 - a lot to do so I'm gonna try to work
00:33 - fast and get as much done as I can and
00:38 - before we go to the code I'm gonna fill
00:40 - you in on the steps needed before we
00:44 - launch because we're getting close close
00:47 - enough that that list of steps is not
00:49 - that long so let's do that let me get it
00:57 - pulled over on on the screen here
01:05 - alright so I'm gonna copy and paste this
01:09 - into my editor I think if it'll let me
01:14 - know I think it's gonna let me know
01:21 - alright I just have to bring it over
01:32 - and copy
01:41 - all right there we go I was trying to
01:46 - copy a checklist from Google keep and
01:49 - evidently you it doesn't let you so but
01:52 - you can copy it to a Google Doc so
01:55 - here's my to-do list that I've just
01:58 - named to do today because every day is
02:00 - today so then I don't have to change the
02:02 - name for different days of the week so
02:07 - hopefully you can you can see this list
02:09 - here's some stuff that I've had on here
02:11 - previously and yes I do have to remind
02:14 - myself to eat that is on my list several
02:17 - times so here's what's what's left so
02:22 - let's finish the faculty page component
02:24 - we're going to do that in today's stream
02:26 - or at least get pretty close and I'll
02:27 - finish up later so that should be done
02:30 - then we're going to update that faculty
02:32 - list component so we just need to plug
02:36 - in that data that we've got so that
02:39 - should be pretty easy because we can
02:42 - just copy and paste a lot of what we've
02:44 - done in the faculty component into the
02:46 - faculty this component so those two
02:48 - there's a good chance these two it could
02:49 - be done today all right we need to pull
02:52 - in that data for those sample schedules
02:54 - so if you remember a few streams ago we
02:56 - made that sample schedule component and
02:59 - we weren't using real data right we
03:01 - brought in some data and we need to get
03:04 - that data from WordPress since we we did
03:09 - a couple of streams on trying to get
03:11 - that data into our graph QL from from WP
03:18 - graph QL to make it work with that
03:20 - plugin couldn't get that to work so to
03:23 - me I see that as a big time sink that I
03:26 - don't have time for right now so I'm
03:29 - gonna put that on hold and I'm just
03:31 - gonna go with what I know works we're
03:33 - gonna get that data from the REST API
03:34 - unfortunately it's gonna mean that we
03:36 - have to make to API calls per page on
03:40 - the pages that have these schedules one
03:42 - for the graph QL one for the REST API
03:45 - but I think that it is going to be
03:48 - faster to implement than trying to
03:51 - modify some
03:54 - WordPress plugins at least for me at
03:57 - this point it is I need to double-check
04:01 - the menu links on the top and side nav
04:03 - I've noticed sometimes when I'm clipping
04:04 - clicking around is taking me to the
04:06 - wrong page so I'm not sure why that's
04:08 - happening I need to go in and
04:10 - double-check just to see what's going on
04:14 - and then I'd like to push all the
04:16 - changes to dev so this needs to happen
04:18 - by the end of the day today so I don't
04:21 - know if I'll get through all these but
04:23 - definitely by the end of the day today I
04:24 - want to push changes to that dev trance
04:27 - ISKCON university so that that's
04:29 - up-to-date I can't remember the last
04:30 - time I I put the changes there and I
04:33 - need to get this link out to some people
04:35 - at the University so we can't go live
04:39 - until I get approval from some people so
04:43 - that's that's kind of gonna be a hold up
04:47 - for us so where my boss is trying to
04:50 - schedule that meeting right now he's
04:51 - thinking we might not be able to get the
04:53 - meeting until the first week of August
04:55 - so that makes our launch date maybe the
04:58 - second week of August somewhere around
05:00 - there and I mean if we can get the
05:02 - meeting in sooner that'd be awesome but
05:05 - that's no matter whether the site's done
05:09 - or not before then we can't launch until
05:11 - so approval so other thing we want to do
05:15 - is create a floating side menu so I have
05:17 - all the data I need now for those menus
05:19 - and we'll create that if you're not sure
05:21 - what that is don't worry about it we'll
05:23 - stream about that and then we'll put the
05:25 - data in for that we need to finish that
05:27 - search component and I've got new data
05:30 - in for the search URLs as I mentioned
05:32 - yesterday and so my student workers are
05:36 - working on completing that data once
05:38 - that's completed we can pull the data in
05:40 - we should be able to finish that search
05:42 - page and then we need to make sure that
05:45 - our search inputs on the side nav and on
05:48 - the top nav for desktop that bar you
05:51 - know they actually work and I need to
05:57 - build a custom admissions landing page
05:59 - so I've sketched out just in my notebook
06:01 - some designs for this so I just need to
06:04 - follow those sketches to build out a
06:06 - landing page because the
06:08 - basically the admissions department
06:09 - needs to approve this website before it
06:13 - goes live because it's going to this
06:15 - website will most directly impact the
06:17 - work that they're doing since it's
06:18 - geared towards incoming students so
06:21 - that's who I have to get a meeting with
06:22 - the vice president of admissions and the
06:26 - Director of Admissions need to sign off
06:29 - on that so I want to make that
06:31 - particular page look as good as possible
06:35 - and then finally the advance if I have
06:40 - time I want to add that advanced custom
06:42 - field data to WP graph QL so I don't
06:44 - have to use the REST API and make
06:46 - multiple API calls so that's it I'm sure
06:50 - I'll find other stuff in the site then
06:52 - he's done but basically the this is the
06:54 - step to launch to launching everything
06:57 - so I get all these done get approval and
07:01 - the site can launch alright so just
07:05 - wanted to give you all an overview I
07:07 - know I do get asked somewhat frequently
07:11 - when the site's going to launch by
07:14 - people at the University and by by you
07:16 - all you know in the stream or in social
07:18 - media so I just wanted to give you a
07:20 - heads up on that okay let me start my
07:25 - Pomodoro timer and we can get started on
07:28 - on this which yesterday I don't know
07:33 - that we had this data in here so here's
07:35 - what I've done since yesterday so hey
07:42 - everyone I see some of you in the in the
07:43 - chat don't want to leave you hanging hey
07:45 - what's going on today is there is there
07:48 - a soccer or football on today again I
07:53 - get no viewers when this football
07:58 - Stevens has come to Austin and gets
08:00 - let's get some ramen that would be
08:02 - awesome
08:02 - I'm a big fan of ramen and I haven't had
08:04 - it in so long
08:05 - partly because I was on a diet for a
08:08 - while but my my weight is pretty good
08:12 - right now so I definitely need some
08:15 - ramen ok so here's what I did I added in
08:19 - these fields
08:21 - for just just a bunch of spans for all
08:25 - those different things you can see here
08:27 - the job title email phone number and
08:30 - then that that curriculum vitae that CV
08:33 - field but I added in the check so we had
08:36 - talked yesterday about making sure we
08:38 - need to check to see if that date is
08:40 - actually there so that's what I've added
08:43 - in here is a just a check to see like
08:48 - does that exist
08:49 - if it does exist and then get it so what
08:53 - I'm gonna do to test this out is I'm
08:55 - gonna go in and take away some data so
09:01 - let's just let's take out this phone
09:04 - number and update so we will no longer
09:07 - have a phone number and hopefully the
09:12 - page won't break what's why doesn't know
09:15 - let me update
09:16 - I may have to log in again alright cool
09:24 - what worked that time alright so let's
09:26 - go back here refresh all right cool so
09:33 - look the the phone number didn't show up
09:35 - at all but you can see we didn't get an
09:40 - error because we've checked here and
09:43 - we're only conditionally trying to
09:46 - render the value of that field alright
09:48 - so if there is if this exists then we
09:53 - get the value and we put that in our
09:56 - span tag if it doesn't exist nothing
09:59 - happens right so that's what we need
10:02 - that a check for each thing in here so
10:05 - we probably will need to do that as well
10:07 - for all this up here to will we yeah we
10:16 - will but for now let's just get this
10:20 - formatting sorted so let me put that
10:24 - phone number back in
10:28 - Update
10:36 - okay cool so we should have the number
10:40 - again great alright so here's what I'm
10:44 - thinking in terms of getting is you know
10:47 - looking better
10:48 - I did some I already did some updates on
10:51 - fonts making these these headers a
10:56 - little bit nicer these headers are way
10:59 - too small so I still need these are
11:01 - eight sixes so we need to up that for
11:05 - sure this this text here the main text
11:08 - is at 18 pixels I believe that these h3s
11:13 - are also around 18 pixels as well at
11:17 - least I I think yeah so I mean maybe if
11:34 - I just if I bump this up a little bit it
11:36 - should work I want to keep that visual
11:38 - hierarchy but I don't want things to get
11:41 - like so huge that it's kind of
11:43 - ridiculous so we'll probably play around
11:45 - with the CSS on these just a bit see
11:48 - what looks right but you can see these
11:52 - are outside of our container so we just
11:54 - need to move our container class up a
11:58 - level so it encompasses all of this and
12:00 - that's going to bring this all into
12:01 - alignment I definitely don't want the
12:03 - default link styling so we're gonna
12:05 - apply some of the the link styling that
12:07 - we've already we already have kind of
12:09 - across the board on the site we're just
12:11 - going to make sure that applies to this
12:12 - as well and then we're going to display
12:16 - all this information you know kind of
12:19 - stacked on top of each other so that's
12:22 - the plan right now let's deal with the
12:24 - easiest things first so here our content
12:33 - div let's see if it's a steady content
12:42 - so we have we've said this div with the
12:46 - data attest ID of content we're given a
12:49 - max width of 90% margin:0 auto so let's
13:00 - do this differently I wonder what we
13:08 - didn't put this in some of these other
13:10 - styles oh because we have no Styles at
13:17 - all all right then well you know what we
13:22 - can do we didn't put any styles into
13:28 - here before because we were pulling all
13:30 - the mark-up end but now we we can change
13:34 - that so we can pull out some of these so
13:39 - let's just copy over us from a different
13:42 - component some of our styles here okay
13:54 - faculty
13:58 - what do you all think is it better to
14:03 - put our styles at the top of the
14:04 - component or at the bottom of the
14:06 - component I always put them at the top
14:08 - but the other project that I was working
14:11 - on by the way I finished my work my
14:14 - piece of the work for the balance app so
14:18 - there's still more to be done so I'm not
14:20 - sure when it's gonna launch but I'm
14:21 - finished with that now so hopefully I'll
14:23 - free up a little bit of time for me but
14:26 - anyway when I was working on that they
14:28 - had the styles underneath and I kind of
14:31 - liked that because you don't when you
14:33 - start to get a lot of styles it it's a
14:36 - lot of scrolling before you actually get
14:37 - to the component so I don't know let's
14:40 - try to put them down below for now and
14:43 - just kind of see see how that how that
14:48 - go see how we like it all right so let's
14:52 - see what cost can only be used in a
14:57 - Dutch that's ridiculous okay
15:14 - I so don't need root here I need
15:23 - let's just call this content I'm sorry
15:29 - container make this container I want to
15:36 - see with you what y'all think about the
15:38 - styles here so I'm going to the chat
15:39 - just for a second
15:41 - Steven says I prefer the bottom I feel
15:44 - like it's more convenient if you need to
15:45 - come in and make changes
15:47 - how many styles in every matters nikki
15:50 - says four styles as long as you're
15:51 - consistent over the entire app all the
15:53 - top are all at the bottom okay yeah I do
15:55 - I like that I know we've done everything
15:57 - at the top so far it wouldn't really be
15:59 - that big of a deal to switch things to
16:02 - the bottom just a little copy and
16:04 - pasting so I don't know I'm gonna try it
16:07 - out on the bottom I kind of like it and
16:10 - then if I really do like it we want to
16:13 - stick with it I'll make an issue about
16:15 - changing the styles and then maybe
16:17 - somebody will come in and do it and if
16:19 - not at some point when I get some some
16:21 - time I'll go do it or maybe each time I
16:24 - open up a new component make an edit
16:27 - I'll flip the styles of that component
16:29 - to the bottom you know I mean there's
16:30 - there's just there's a couple of ways we
16:32 - can make that happen but for today we'll
16:34 - try it try it here and I'm I am a little
16:40 - bit concerned as to why it's telling me
16:42 - that I can't use Const that's really
16:46 - weird
16:47 - am i putting this in the wrong oh you
16:52 - know what it might it shouldn't affect
16:54 - cost but it might be mad that I put this
16:56 - inside of here
17:03 - okay that should be better container and
17:10 - we can put in max with 100%
17:18 - nope that's the wrong thing max with 90%
17:24 - and margin yeah Auto all right cool
17:36 - now we can go to this div and add style
17:42 - equals Styles the container set out
17:49 - there we go
17:50 - and I believe we can get rid of this
17:54 - data test ID I don't think we need that
17:58 - anymore
18:00 - and we can also get rid of it in here
18:04 - oops you know what we got to do this
18:06 - media query as well I can never remember
18:10 - the syntax for a media query in when
18:12 - we're doing styles like this but I know
18:15 - we've used it elsewhere so let's go with
18:19 - I think what would be the fastest way to
18:24 - do this maybe just look it up in
18:27 - material UI because I can't remember
18:28 - what component I did this in media
18:34 - queries
18:45 - with with nucleus there we are okay so
18:52 - we can use these theme breakpoints so
18:59 - just copy and paste that here yeah and
19:09 - we had a 600 pixel let me see what these
19:12 - points equate to alright small is 600
19:20 - pixels or larger so yep - that
19:23 - corresponds awesome exactly what we need
19:27 - down all right so we don't went down we
19:35 - went up so we want small which is 600
19:40 - pixels and up we're gonna give it a max
19:44 - width of 70 70% anything below that the
19:50 - max was going to be 90
19:52 - all right and then that way we don't
19:54 - have these huge white gaps on small
19:58 - screens that are just way too big save
20:04 - that see how it's working oops let's
20:07 - take this out first
20:15 - okay syntax error
20:48 - that's weird all right why is it giving
20:52 - me that I've done something wrong well
20:57 - since we have this on the screen already
20:58 - let's look up how it was done your con
21:00 - styles well they have styles equal steam
21:03 - with styles do I need that with Styles I
21:10 - not have that on this component
21:12 - I do not okay
21:18 - yeah I don't we can just grab with wait
21:23 - a second go through it with data there
21:25 - we go with styles I didn't see it in
21:30 - here before
21:32 - oh it's all the way at the top okay
21:38 - when I first copy this over I looked
21:41 - here to see if there's something else I
21:42 - need and just did not see that one okay
21:46 - throw that in there and then we need to
21:49 - change up how we're gonna do this so I'm
21:52 - gonna copy everything over and then just
21:54 - adapt what's down here so rude okay so
22:04 - she should be able to just do this
22:18 - add in another yep there we go alright
22:25 - let's see if it works now still doesn't
22:30 - work come on
22:39 - Hey in is here how's it going inner
22:42 - thanks for joining us
22:46 - shoot what am I doing wrong
23:14 - oh you know what let's see where's a
23:21 - page from actually using this not
23:25 - another sample schedule styles
23:49 - so oh I know I know I put two brackets
23:57 - instead of just one so if I was going to
24:03 - actually put like an inline style here I
24:06 - do need two brackets because the second
24:08 - set of brackets would mean it's a it's
24:10 - an object but I'm not trying to put an
24:11 - object in here I'm trying to put in a
24:13 - variable a constant so that was my
24:16 - problem I mean the other stuff of
24:21 - importing I would have to have done that
24:23 - anyway so I'm glad I put that in theme
24:26 - is not defined what
24:40 - oh did I use I think I need the theme
24:48 - for the break points to work
24:50 - and where's let's see how we do that
24:55 - here styles theme and I'm gonna put
25:03 - everything in an arrow function okay all
25:10 - right
25:30 - all right one more time all right cool
25:35 - what works but it no it's not all right
25:42 - let's see
25:51 - where is
26:08 - assistive alright let's see what we did
26:14 - okay so on this div we put this style
26:18 - these containers styles and those were
26:28 - the same styles that we had over here we
26:32 - just brought him over okay
27:01 - that's kind of weird so I'm assuming
27:04 - it's this div but it looks like there's
27:08 - no the styles that we want to be applied
27:13 - there or not being applied and let me go
27:18 - back to the console
27:27 - we're not getting any warning thats
27:29 - related to that to let this week has
27:40 - been rough on the streams things that
27:42 - should just happen that are very simple
27:45 - that we've done a million times are just
27:47 - not working okay alright let me go back
27:59 - to here and see who's done Oh
28:12 - okay well there's one thing I messed up
28:14 - I put this outside when it should have
28:23 - been inside
28:34 - see that makes any difference at all
28:43 - so nothing okay see
29:24 - and see how they apply these
29:33 - ah this is why
30:05 - because stars
30:11 - I don't know so this doing it like this
30:15 - works here but I think we need to do it
30:20 - like this now let me double-check that
30:26 - yeah so we need to have these classes
30:29 - and then add this as a class name so I
30:36 - guess we can do it right here at the top
30:41 - if we do it in the renderer yeah
31:16 - crops is not defined
31:31 - there we go it worked this time
31:41 - see there we go 70 and then once we get
31:45 - a little bit smaller see it it changes
31:48 - to 90 all right wonderful - at least
31:53 - everything's on a row that was rough oh
32:02 - so rough okay so my time is almost up
32:08 - I'm gonna go to the live chat in just a
32:11 - second and check the questions and then
32:13 - we'll get back to the code and I'm gonna
32:18 - take a drink of G fuel try to get my
32:23 - brain working so I've been having
32:34 - morning meetings like really long
32:35 - morning meetings for the last three days
32:37 - this is my last day and it just kind of
32:41 - kills you like right in the morning like
32:43 - your brain is just I don't know for me
32:46 - like after a long meeting my brain is
32:48 - done so I try to like combat that I've
32:52 - been working out every morning but like
32:54 - you work out your pumps you know and
32:56 - then you just sit for like an hour and a
33:01 - half and anyway I'm making excuses for
33:09 - my for my bad Cody
33:19 - all right
33:21 - not that much in the chat so I'll
33:23 - probably get through this all within the
33:27 - five-minute break
33:33 - Rubin says hey Jesse handsome as always
33:36 - is graph QL a database itself or does it
33:39 - use something else I really like the way
33:42 - you ask that question
33:45 - started out by calling me handsome I
33:49 - will just say this in general it's
33:52 - normally not a great idea to you know
33:56 - talk about somebody's looks when it's
34:00 - off topic but in my case I'm always very
34:04 - flattered by comments about my look so
34:06 - I'm cool with that but I just I give the
34:09 - disclaimer because I know there's
34:10 - especially a lot of female coders who
34:13 - constantly get comments about their
34:15 - looks and it's I mean it's not they
34:21 - don't want that that kind of attention
34:25 - I'm not saying all people don't want
34:28 - that attention but I'm saying there are
34:30 - some female coders who get a lot of that
34:34 - and it's it's unwanted so anyway so just
34:38 - just surround it for me it's cool but
34:41 - that doesn't make it cool for everybody
34:43 - but anyway Rubin totally awesome I love
34:47 - that that way you ask that question and
34:49 - graph qo is not a database right it's
34:53 - it's like an API right so like rest is
34:56 - not a database but it's a way to get
34:59 - data from a database does that make
35:02 - sense
35:17 - all right Nikki says do you need to do
35:19 - that check so here's the check we were
35:20 - doing here saying do we have to do that
35:24 - check like graph QL will return know and
35:36 - react will just ignore suffice know
35:38 - you'll get empty span tags so yeah I
35:41 - keep the check yeah so we potentially
35:43 - would get empty span tags but also I
35:50 - don't know that's kind of a good
35:51 - question I don't want to take any more
35:55 - time to test it out I'm gonna keep them
35:57 - in there for now but what I found before
36:00 - and maybe this is different because of
36:02 - the way that data gets in there is what
36:05 - would happen then in the data that we're
36:07 - getting from let me pull this over like
36:12 - we're getting this data and we would end
36:14 - up having like the email field would say
36:17 - email field null here and it wouldn't
36:21 - have value so it wouldn't say value no
36:23 - it would say email field no and that's
36:27 - where we would get the error because it
36:29 - would say like basically like we're
36:35 - trying to look this up that doesn't
36:38 - exist and I'd get an error message does
36:41 - that make sense or even worse sometimes
36:47 - the data comes in and like this is just
36:49 - gone completely but I think this should
36:54 - be good well we know this works we know
36:55 - it's good we took out the data and it's
36:57 - still work so but I mean at the very
37:00 - least it does save us actually no we're
37:04 - still getting empty span tags the way I
37:05 - did it here I need to do it like this
37:08 - and actually put the span tag inside of
37:12 - this so we might change that I mean if I
37:17 - have an empty span tag it's not the end
37:18 - of the world but it's probably better
37:19 - practice not to have it
37:33 - I see this is already going out to lunch
37:38 - with some team members we'll have to
37:39 - catch the replay when I get back got to
37:41 - get that ramen enjoy the ramen I wish it
37:45 - was me and it says I'm fine how goes
37:53 - your day Jesse yeah it not bad I got in
37:56 - a good workout this morning and got to
37:59 - my meeting on time I actually fit into a
38:05 - pair of pants that I haven't fit into
38:06 - for a long time so that was good they
38:08 - were still a little like tight so I'm
38:11 - not sure how tight is too tight for guys
38:12 - wearing pants so I went with a different
38:18 - pair but I was high excited that I can
38:20 - actually get him on and button him up so
38:21 - if that sounds weird to you I've been I
38:24 - was on a diet been working out recently
38:26 - so that's the exciting news for me so
38:31 - anyway so my name's Ben I've been ok so
38:34 - far thank you for asking
38:38 - Oh Nicki already pointed out that I'll
38:45 - still get empty span tags yeah you're
38:49 - right I will still get empty span tags
38:51 - so maybe we should change that up now
38:53 - yeah so let's change this let's get rid
39:00 - of these fantex
39:07 - and let's throw in
39:15 - after this end
39:26 - and then here
39:48 - there we go
39:52 - so now what will happen is the the
39:56 - entire span will be there or not
39:59 - depending on whether or not this field
40:06 - is there well cool you know what
40:13 - honestly I'm super curious now whether
40:16 - or not we even need this check so I
40:23 - really want to try this so the easiest
40:26 - way to do this right now it's just to
40:28 - actually is to render this twice so this
40:32 - one will have the check this one won't
40:34 - have the check and we'll see what
40:35 - happens so right now we should get it
40:39 - twice which we forgot to put
41:13 - there we go I needed to put brackets in
41:17 - here so we were back in JavaScript land
41:19 - and these would then be variables so
41:22 - they're being interpreted as strings and
41:24 - just add it in there we go okay so we
41:27 - should have yep two email addresses and
41:32 - you know what I'm I'm just gonna add
41:33 - some some styles on here right now
41:38 - because this is annoying me
41:52 - what am I going to call this info row
42:01 - and for now we'll just go display:block
42:11 - so this should give us what we need
42:26 - so just for now at least
42:38 - okay if that look crazy I'll just
42:42 - explain I use multiple cursors so I was
42:44 - able to highlight multiple instances of
42:46 - the same thing and then type it out at
42:49 - one so all I really did was just added
42:51 - class name classes info row two for span
42:57 - tags and that's just as display block to
43:01 - all of those come on there we go okay
43:09 - now it's it's easier to read so we can
43:12 - clearly see that here we have the email
43:16 - address twice now onto the test let's
43:19 - remove this well not phone number we're
43:23 - doing email address this time let's
43:24 - remove the email address update this see
43:27 - what happens and we're testing to see
43:31 - are basically we're testing our error
43:33 - checking to see like is this even an
43:36 - issue
43:37 - hmm okay good to know it's not an issue
43:46 - so I guess that Nikki was right let's go
43:53 - to our our content here and let me grab
43:59 - this data again and
44:07 - no that's not how many are they'd given
44:12 - me not enough let's see if I can get
44:17 - faculty where the is it name
44:39 - No
44:48 - I can't remember the syntax for this
44:53 - area name
45:08 - and the scrap name here should be this
45:17 - you know what let's just go with slug
45:19 - because I know for sure
45:21 - slug will be consistent
45:39 - it's not gonna work yeah ah let's see it
45:50 - works because if if the thing he tried a
45:54 - span tried to access something from Nall
45:56 - your console would probably throw an
45:58 - error okay yeah let's just check the
46:05 - console maybe I won't need to do this
46:26 - you know what it still rendered these
46:29 - but it's just rendering them empty so I
46:35 - wonder if see that's what I want to see
46:39 - what how the values coming back oh you
46:43 - know what what am I thinking we already
46:45 - have this here where name equals there
46:49 - we go
47:00 - and that's okay
47:05 - and now we'll say this choice now all
47:16 - right there we are so now it's the email
47:19 - field value and it gives us a value
47:23 - that's just it's nothing okay so because
47:27 - that's the way the data comes up we
47:30 - don't need to do any checks at least not
47:33 - on these now the the place where we
47:37 - definitely need checks is here in our
47:39 - media details because you can see like
47:42 - there potentially could be other sizes
47:45 - here and then they would either just
47:48 - exist or not exist at all so that's
47:51 - where we need the checks so we could we
47:59 - can either keep the checks here if we
48:00 - really want to keep out empty spans we
48:07 - can add to this so we could say let's go
48:16 - to our ends you affect me phone field
48:25 - value is not equal to like all right see
48:37 - that way
48:42 - there we are so now it's not rendering
48:46 - empty empty spans all right wonderful so
48:52 - now we're no longer rendering empties
48:55 - fans and we can get to styling this
49:02 - great so we started the styling process
49:10 - a bit here already oops let me make sure
49:12 - I put this back in this email no I
49:22 - believe it was s oops it
49:34 - that's pretty much how all the email
49:35 - gestures go around here so I'm just
49:39 - gonna go with that
49:47 - so yeah so name position email phone
49:57 - number CV down here great so do are we
50:08 - using grid here already
50:10 - we're not right disk full with your
50:17 - icons
50:24 - why we have this I don't know why we
50:28 - have that in there let's take that out
50:32 - we need we need to import grid so let's
50:40 - pull it in from here now we can use grid
50:47 - and now let's copy and paste some of the
50:50 - stuff we did win in the sample schedule
50:53 - I'll copy and paste it into here
50:56 - and we're gonna put this grid around
51:03 - yeah it's yeah yeah we don't want it to
51:13 - be the everything in the grid container
51:16 - we want to make this grid so before we
51:23 - get to this content here we're gonna do
51:26 - a closing tag for our our grid container
51:30 - and we're also gonna add a closing well
51:33 - that the first one would be for the grid
51:36 - item and this one is going to be the
51:37 - grid container all right so now that
51:41 - works and we want to make sure after
51:44 - right after the image we also close the
51:48 - grid the grid item and then we open a
51:53 - new grid item we'll copy this and throw
52:01 - that in there and we're gonna change
52:05 - these styles we're gonna change we don't
52:09 - need the key so let's save it
52:17 - there we are okay interesting
52:21 - all right let's switch it up a bit I
52:23 - want to move this outside of our grid so
52:32 - what that there we are now we have the
52:34 - info down a bit lower I don't know that
52:41 - I really like that will mess with a
52:42 - little bit more but now that I know what
52:47 - I'm looking at it
52:48 - I don't know Nikki says I don't need is
52:53 - not equal to an empty string because an
52:55 - empty string is falsie all right cool I
52:57 - was wondering about that and I'm really
52:59 - glad that it is did you ever go with
53:05 - like you think something will work one
53:08 - way but you know it will work another
53:10 - way and instead of looking it up you
53:12 - just go with the way you know will work
53:13 - that was one of those that's one of
53:17 - those times it's probably not the best
53:19 - thing to do but if you're trying to get
53:21 - something done fast you know you just
53:24 - you do it right extra few characters in
53:28 - there but really it only took a few a
53:32 - second or so alright
53:39 - all right so here's what I'm not sure
53:42 - about so if we were to make this screen
53:44 - bigger right then you would have this
53:46 - stuff all the way over here I mean does
53:50 - that even make sense you could flip it
53:53 - around the other way maybe that would
53:57 - make more sense I don't know let me know
54:04 - what you think in the chat I'm I'm kind
54:06 - of stuck here on on styling on what
54:10 - makes more sense I mean for mobile like
54:14 - this works I like this I mean I don't
54:18 - think it looks that good but like it it
54:21 - makes sense
54:25 - it needs some styling though
54:30 - but then on desktop there's just all
54:34 - this space here
54:51 - all right I just need to make a decision
54:56 - so we need to get it done all right I'm
55:01 - gonna leave it like this for now we'll
55:02 - do a little bit of styling see if it
55:05 - looks better once we get this cleaned up
55:08 - a bit you know what we do have the class
55:11 - on these rows here so let's just start
55:17 - adding it right in here all right so I
55:22 - definitely want font size let's go with
55:30 - 20 20 pixel font size and 1 i spaced a
55:40 - bit so I'm gonna say margin bottom right
55:47 - because I don't I don't want to have I
55:48 - want it to line up with the image right
55:50 - on the top so I don't want to have this
55:51 - weird thing so I'm just gonna put margin
55:53 - on the bottom and I'm gonna go with 8
55:57 - pixels
56:05 - let's see what we get all right not bad
56:15 - not bad
56:23 - let's see what it looks like when we go
56:25 - down
56:31 - actually whenever they were we'll never
56:34 - really see a screen more narrow than
56:36 - that and we could let's just run it like
56:40 - this
56:56 - all right let me know what you all think
56:57 - um I'm happy with that for now
57:03 - let's see Nietzsche says definitely
57:06 - these kinds of things you need time if
57:08 - you're not careful so I still love them
57:11 - and bump the line height of the info
57:15 - text next to the picture add some margin
57:17 - bottom to e settle a nicer Oh perfect
57:20 - this because of the delay Nicki had sent
57:27 - that message before I said it but that's
57:29 - awesome that we're on the same page
57:31 - there okay actually I think this is fine
57:36 - this is not the most beautiful thing
57:37 - I've ever designed and developed here
57:39 - but considering number one it looks a
57:44 - heck of a lot better than what we had
57:45 - and we don't have a lot of time so I
57:48 - think this is fine for now so the only
57:53 - other things we should do on these pages
57:55 - is clean this up a bit and also increase
58:00 - font size right now let's check the font
58:02 - size on this right now and we're just
58:04 - going to go in and change there we go
58:09 - our eight-six is you know what I totally
58:11 - didn't realize that I had the font size
58:14 - on this stuff so small sorry for that
58:21 - okay so what our eight-six let's change
58:24 - our font size too
58:29 - all right let's see what eighteen looks
58:31 - like 18 pixels actually you know what I
58:38 - really liked that I liked 18 let's go
58:40 - with that so I actually have this in the
58:43 - CSS because remember these are coming
58:45 - from the content that we're pulling in
58:48 - so we need to put it in the CSS file
58:54 - it's six
58:57 - oops need a separated out h6 font size
59:09 - 20 wait 18 18 pixels so 18 pixels I
59:16 - believe is the same size as the rest of
59:18 - the text on that page but because we
59:21 - have that font weight there it
59:23 - definitely looks like it's it's a
59:26 - heading right that's what we want
59:27 - and I want to check the what I have for
59:30 - these h3 cuz they should be bigger than
59:32 - an h6 and computed font size see it's
59:38 - slightly bigger so let's let's change
59:41 - those h threes
59:46 - let's bump those up to 20
60:03 - okay
60:05 - not a huge thing but it's definitely 20
60:07 - so that was a little over one pixel
60:09 - difference but I definitely you know I
60:12 - want that change since we we bump this
60:16 - up and then clearly I believe that's an
60:19 - h1 that's clearly you know bigger than
60:22 - these so I think this is fine for now
60:31 - okay cool that works so that's taken
60:36 - care of now we just need this let's go
60:43 - can we do this there's I definitely have
60:47 - some some CSS in another CSS file to
60:50 - handle links so in this particular
60:53 - component we're pulling in just the
60:57 - faculty dot CSS but I believe we had a
61:01 - CSS file that included just kind of
61:05 - Universal styles is anybody is anybody
61:11 - listening to the throwbackthursday
61:13 - playlist for today on Spotify it sounds
61:16 - like it's all 90s rock music but it's
61:20 - nice it's nostalgic that's what I have
61:24 - on right now it's
61:30 - oh here we are is it page is that the
61:38 - one
61:46 - yeah all right so the style sheets need
61:50 - they're a bit of a mess now they
61:53 - definitely need some work so for now I'm
61:55 - just gonna copy and paste this over
61:57 - instead of pulling all these styles in
62:04 - by that I mean instead of actually
62:07 - importing a separate style sheet I'd
62:10 - rather not do that and I know I bet I've
62:14 - been saying like we need to do this
62:16 - project fast I don't have time to clean
62:17 - these up you know so but that time that
62:21 - needs to come before they get too too
62:24 - crazy so let's see if this works you
62:29 - know what it's alright it will work yeah
62:34 - but realistically this is its own
62:36 - component so we could probably take this
62:38 - and put it in put it here but there
62:46 - could be links within this content that
62:48 - we're getting so we're gonna need that
62:50 - anyway so I'm not at this point gonna
62:52 - duplicate those Styles here so here's
62:57 - the view CV you know it's at the bottom
63:00 - it's kind of out of the way but I think
63:04 - that's fun we had a discussion about
63:06 - this yesterday I I don't think we should
63:09 - be highlighting hey you know download
63:12 - this PDF alright great cool and then
63:20 - what I'll do after the stream is I'm
63:24 - going to assign to my student workers to
63:26 - look through all of the profiles all the
63:30 - profiles for these professors and let me
63:33 - know which ones look really weird if
63:35 - there's something going on in this
63:37 - content area that I don't know what kind
63:41 - of markup they could have some
63:43 - professors I think had like YouTube
63:45 - embeds and stuff so they'll let us know
63:49 - and that'll save us a lot of time in
63:51 - testing but they'll let us know if we
63:53 - need to account for anything else any
63:55 - other type of markup
63:58 - all right wonderful and my timers up so
64:01 - that's perfect timing
64:03 - so let's before I go back to the chat
64:10 - and answer questions let's commit this
64:13 - and push it up to the main repo and I'm
64:17 - you know what I just now realize that I
64:19 - am running angry and I could have given
64:20 - you all the link but I guess I'll throw
64:24 - it in there right now if you want to
64:25 - just kind of see what's what's happening
64:29 - very sorry about that I was right before
64:31 - I started the stream I was like remember
64:33 - the N growling and then I didn't
64:35 - remember it all right but let's get this
64:38 - committed so let's do it get status just
64:40 - to double-check what we've changed so
64:43 - yep we updated that quick well I updated
64:45 - this query before like a few minutes
64:48 - before we started we updated that
64:51 - faculty j/s the CSS great so let's do a
64:59 - git add atom all the yarn cm and yarn cm
65:06 - you probably don't have that on your
65:07 - project it's a little custom thing -
65:14 - it's a little custom thing to help you
65:17 - create a well formatted commit message
65:19 - so otherwise you just want to type in
65:22 - git commit with the little m flag so get
65:25 - commit - m and then you can put your
65:28 - message in in quotes let's see we really
65:38 - just styled this right
65:49 - yeah
65:52 - and I don't think we have an issue about
65:54 - this so I'm not gonna bother with that
65:58 - okay so while that does its thing runs
66:00 - all the tests does the auto formatting
66:02 - I'm going to go to the chat please put
66:05 - your questions in the chat now if you
66:06 - have any questions for me to answer once
66:08 - I get through everything in the chat I'm
66:10 - going to end the stream all right great
66:13 - now I'll push this get push awesome
66:21 - now all this code is available to you on
66:23 - the github repo that's linked in the
66:25 - description so just check it out if you
66:28 - go into that repo you can go into the
66:31 - the pages folder and then go into that
66:35 - faculty j/s and that's where we did most
66:37 - of the work but feel free to use that
66:43 - for whatever you want or add or correct
66:46 - anything that I messed up all right okay
66:53 - actually not that much in the live chat
66:54 - so should be pretty quick free rack says
67:00 - I need to learn react well yeah if
67:03 - you're interested in learning reacts you
67:07 - can definitely watch these streams to
67:08 - check it out but there's also some
67:12 - videos I think Bo Carnes did a react
67:15 - intro video series sorry for the awning
67:21 - and that's on our Channel right now
67:23 - there's a react interest series on learn
67:26 - code academies so it's will Stern's
67:29 - YouTube channel and then the react
67:32 - documentation is great for learning it
67:34 - so that's what I would recommend free
67:37 - code camp has some react stuff now in
67:39 - their in their challenges as well
67:44 - Elon Musk says hello hello Elon thanks
67:51 - for joining
67:59 - oh yeah and it looks like Ilan was also
68:01 - wanting to know how to learn react stuff
68:03 - so yeah so those stuff that I just said
68:05 - is probably a really good place to start
68:07 - I've heard that there's also like I did
68:12 - the Udacity react nano degree if you're
68:14 - interested in spending some money to get
68:15 - more formal training check that out
68:18 - I a lot of people like West bosses
68:22 - courses I've never done one of his
68:24 - courses but he's done react stuff react
68:27 - training has has some courses so I
68:31 - haven't done all these things I just
68:32 - heard good things about them but yeah
68:36 - there's a lot out there so but I would
68:41 - say like check out some of the stuff
68:42 - that I mentioned because I I know I've
68:45 - either done it myself or I've heard that
68:47 - they're really good alright ambition
68:52 - says can you explain what WebKit and
68:54 - prefixes are used for yes so when
69:01 - browsers don't support something in CSS
69:06 - sometimes they'll alright so this is my
69:12 - I don't Lee this explanation gonna be
69:13 - very official but essentially like using
69:15 - those prefixes from a developer
69:17 - standpoint that's a way to make things
69:19 - work in browsers where things aren't
69:21 - like officially supported by default
69:23 - right so what is it the Moz prefix and I
69:28 - don't even remember all the prefixes
69:29 - usually I there's I use things that auto
69:32 - prefix so I don't worry about it but if
69:36 - you use those prefixes then you can get
69:40 - what you're trying to do in CSS to work
69:44 - so if you try to use it without the
69:47 - prefix and someone's using one of those
69:49 - browsers that need it then that part of
69:52 - your CSS just it'll be ignored and the
69:57 - reason behind it right I don't know
70:00 - technically how it's all done the reason
70:01 - is just that different browser support
70:03 - different things in CSS officially but
70:06 - they sometimes will have like
70:12 - I don't like a workaround to use it
70:16 - right before it becomes official and is
70:18 - officially supported it's it's I guess
70:20 - tested out behind this this prefix this
70:22 - vendor prefix correct me if I'm wrong
70:26 - about all that I just know that it works
70:30 - and how to make it work I don't you know
70:32 - what I'm saying like I don't know the
70:33 - whole reasoning behind it but I believe
70:35 - that's it but anyway a lot of times you
70:40 - can find like a plugin that will work
70:42 - with web pack or gulp or you know
70:45 - whatever you're using that will take
70:47 - your CSS and automatically add prefixes
70:50 - to it so you don't even have to worry
70:52 - about which prefixes to use and it keeps
70:58 - your CSS nice and clean because the
71:00 - stuff you actually work with doesn't
71:02 - have the prefixes it gets added in later
71:04 - on and you never have to see it so
71:07 - that's that's really cool because the
71:09 - prefix stuff can get pretty crazy if
71:11 - you're using a lot of things that need a
71:13 - lot of free fixes Nietzsche says
71:17 - question what snack should I order to go
71:19 - with my french fries I mean with like
71:28 - typically like you get a hamburger right
71:31 - with french fries
71:32 - isn't that that's classic so I would say
71:37 - that it's really hot where I'm at if
71:39 - it's hot where you're right maybe get
71:41 - like a milkshake or an ice cream cone
71:44 - I don't know depending on where you're
71:46 - at in the world but where I'm at there's
71:48 - this fast food chain called Wendy's and
71:51 - you keep they have these kind of like
71:53 - milkshake things called Frosty's and I
71:56 - know it's popular to get a chocolate
71:59 - frosty and then dunk your french fries
72:02 - in it and eat your french fries so I
72:07 - don't mean salt and chocolate definitely
72:09 - go together right so people have done
72:11 - that I do it occasionally I'm not I'm
72:13 - more of a fan of you know catch up with
72:16 - the fries not so much to frosty with my
72:18 - fries but if you don't want the
72:21 - hamburger then
72:23 - I recommend getting some sort of ice
72:25 - cream based treat especially if it's hot
72:32 - and that me that's not healthy advice
72:36 - either so if you if you get if you have
72:40 - health problems because of eating too
72:42 - much junk food then please don't blame
72:45 - me Jacob says maybe you should do a
72:51 - separate design for mobile and desktop I
72:53 - didn't watch at all yes so we do have
72:55 - some but we have design differences
72:58 - between mobile and desktop for sure so
73:01 - the site but most of the site has been
73:05 - designed with mobile as the primary
73:07 - focus and then things just kind of scale
73:12 - up for a desktop yeah but so the design
73:17 - is it's there's not two completely
73:19 - different designs but we just use media
73:21 - queries to change things up when we need
73:23 - to all right Nicky says check out the
73:29 - free beginner course the beginner react
73:31 - course by Kent C Dodds on egghead what'd
73:36 - I say it's like egghead IO is the
73:38 - address all right so I haven't done that
73:40 - course but nicky recommends that also
73:43 - Tyler McGinnis did a good series on
73:45 - YouTube about starting with react okay
73:47 - cool
73:47 - so check those up Avinash this just came
73:52 - what are you building
73:53 - oh we were working on mainly styling a
73:57 - react component using some CSS today and
74:00 - it's part of a much larger project
74:02 - that's been going on for I don't know
74:04 - like six months going on seven months
74:07 - now so yeah at this point I mean this
74:11 - this strain is gonna be available to to
74:15 - watch you know a few minutes after it's
74:17 - over it'll be posted on the free code
74:18 - camp YouTube channel so you know feel
74:21 - free to go back and watch to know more
74:25 - exactly about what we did
74:33 - mmm Nietzsche says Vicki burger it is
74:37 - very popular here in Belgium okay I've
74:40 - never heard of it but I've also never
74:44 - been to Belgium so that's probably what
74:48 - prereq says okay
74:51 - Jesse and and Brooke Brooke is Niki so I
74:55 - I use it interchangeably but thanks for
74:58 - thanks for recommending oh you're
75:00 - welcome no problem good luck with your
75:02 - with your react studies Ivan ska I'll do
75:10 - that is graph QL the future kind of I
75:14 - mean I would say graph QL is is the
75:17 - present and the future at this point
75:19 - because it's been around for a little
75:21 - while and more people are using it I I
75:24 - definitely see graph QL as being better
75:27 - than a rest api so be it it cuts down on
75:32 - the with the rest api usually you have
75:35 - this problem of you make one API call
75:38 - and you get a ton of data and a lot of
75:41 - it you don't even need or you have split
75:45 - your data out into a bunch of different
75:46 - endpoints and then you have to make
75:47 - multiple API calls to different
75:49 - endpoints so you don't necessarily get a
75:51 - bunch of extra data but you're making
75:54 - all these API calls either way like
75:56 - that's not ideal graph QL eliminates
75:59 - that by allowing you to make one API
76:01 - call get exactly the data that you want
76:03 - and nothing more so just that alone is a
76:08 - definite advantage because when you're
76:11 - building a website you want to minimize
76:13 - the amount of data and the amount of
76:16 - network requests that you make all right
76:19 - that's that's gonna help speed for your
76:20 - site for sure it's also gonna help you
76:24 - don't want to eat up people's data plans
76:27 - you know on their on their phone so
76:30 - anything you can do to get the overall
76:33 - size you know in megabytes of your
76:35 - website down is it's a good thing and
76:39 - the speed also you want to get that load
76:42 - time
76:42 - so I think graph QL is in that category
76:46 - is definitely better than a typical REST
76:51 - API
76:55 - Mustafa says reactor angular
76:58 - well I use react I'm I haven't used
77:02 - angular since angular 1 so and I've
77:06 - heard that the new versions of angular
77:08 - so different that I'm not even gonna
77:12 - comment on really on angular because I
77:15 - just don't know I I assume that angular
77:18 - is good a lot of people use it but
77:21 - around here
77:22 - we definitely use react and I like react
77:25 - so I don't really have any plans to use
77:28 - anything other than react any time in
77:30 - the in the near future I'd rather just
77:33 - try to specialize it right now and get
77:35 - get good with that a Vanessa thanks love
77:41 - and support from India oh thank you
77:43 - that's awesome
77:47 - Ilan says how many years of experience
77:50 - do you have in web development 5 6 uh I
77:56 - feel like I could keep saying I've had 5
77:58 - years of experience for the last like 3
78:01 - years I'd have to go back for sure
78:04 - you can check out my LinkedIn if you
78:05 - wanna know for sure but I'm at least 5
78:07 - years
78:09 - Jakob says what web server is your
78:13 - localhost
78:22 - I'm not exactly sure what you want
78:26 - transid answer that question like you
78:29 - know we have webpack running handling
78:32 - all the stuff of being able to run stuff
78:35 - locally and that's like pre-configured
78:40 - since we're using next to build it up
78:42 - and I'm using n grok so that you all can
78:48 - check out the site so I don't know is
78:52 - any of that at all answering your
78:54 - question M LV says hey can I learn react
79:04 - fully for free for sure yeah there's so
79:08 - many free resources out there you can
79:10 - learn react and not spend anything
79:17 - Jacob asks am i using visual studio
79:22 - plug-in yeah I'm I have a lot of plugins
79:26 - for visual studio if you're asking me
79:29 - specifically to run the localhost am i
79:32 - using a visual studio plug-in no it's
79:35 - it's running through web pack so I think
79:37 - that that makes more sense now what
79:39 - you're asking
79:42 - MLV says how long does it take learn
79:44 - react it entirely depends on how much
79:47 - time you have to dedicate to it how much
79:50 - you already know about JavaScript how
79:53 - how smart you are in terms of being able
79:55 - to pick up new ideas so it's I mean I
79:59 - say I mean it definitely took me months
80:04 - before I was confident enough to like
80:09 - really start using reacts on on real
80:12 - projects like projects I was getting
80:14 - paid for
80:27 - Emily says how much of reacts what I
80:30 - have to know to get into back-end
80:31 - development react is front-end so if you
80:37 - want to get into back-end you're gonna
80:39 - have to learn either back-end like
80:41 - language like PHP is widely used Ruby
80:46 - you could use node if you want to stick
80:49 - with JavaScript so yeah but react this
80:53 - just is just front-end
80:55 - I mean you can do server-side rendering
80:57 - with react but you're not it's not used
81:04 - for back-end programming
81:11 - well why were you I think I messed this
81:17 - name up before let me know how to
81:18 - pronounce that well why are you says
81:20 - will I get any benefits by wrapping a
81:23 - REST API with graph QL or will that make
81:26 - the request lower I'm not sure what it
81:28 - would do on the server side in terms of
81:32 - slowness of the request but I could see
81:36 - client-side is that being it being
81:39 - better if you did have a situation where
81:41 - you would have to make lots of API calls
81:44 - with the REST API and by switching to
81:47 - graph QL you only cut that down to one
81:50 - so I guess it would depend on your
81:53 - situation if if using the REST API you
81:56 - only had to make one call you aren't
81:58 - getting a ton of extra data probably
82:01 - okay just to stick with REST API but
82:05 - otherwise it might work with the graph
82:08 - kill but I you know I have no idea what
82:10 - term will kind of slow down would happen
82:12 - on the backend by doing that if if there
82:16 - would be any significant slowdown I'm
82:18 - not sure the stuff uh says thank you for
82:23 - these great live streaming love and
82:25 - respect for Morocco oh thank you
82:27 - Andy I appreciate it MLV says fetch
82:31 - versus Axios which one is better I
82:33 - always use fetch I've I've heard a lot
82:35 - of good things about Axios but I always
82:37 - use fetch it's really simple
82:40 - in terms of like if you're doing it on
82:43 - the client-side and browser it's it's
82:46 - supported by newer browsers natively you
82:48 - don't have to import anything so I like
82:50 - that so in terms of which one is better
82:53 - I don't I don't know I'm sure they each
82:56 - have their advantages or disadvantages
82:57 - but since I haven't really used Axios
82:59 - I'm not at a good position to say which
83:01 - one's better alright and that's the end
83:07 - of the questions and we are just in time
83:10 - for the next stream to start so I
83:12 - believe at 1 p.m. Eastern Time
83:14 - there's going to be a live stream
83:16 - continuing from earlier in the week
83:18 - about creating Alexus skills which I've
83:22 - created Alexis skills before and it's
83:25 - really fun so if you're at all
83:28 - interested in that definitely check it
83:30 - out check out the the live stream and
83:33 - you know make your own skill and let me
83:36 - know if you do because I'll try it out
83:39 - thank you all so much for joining in
83:41 - thank you for all your help and for
83:44 - being patient with me as I struggled
83:45 - through which should have been simple
83:47 - simple things too and let's see trying
83:55 - to find my stop streaming button yeah so
83:59 - tomorrow tomorrow's Friday I'll probably
84:02 - be at home on Friday so I'm gonna try to
84:04 - do a stream last time I tried to stream
84:06 - from home though we had some technical
84:07 - difficulties so hopefully that doesn't
84:10 - happen we can work it out and get a good
84:12 - stream in so hopefully see y'all
84:15 - tomorrow maybe next week if I can't get
84:18 - things working right
84:20 - but until then have a wonderful day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're going to finish up what we started yesterday which was that faculty component and we pulled in some new data so I did just a little bit with it after yesterday's stream so it shouldn't be too hard to catch everyone up we've got a lot to do so I'm gonna try to work fast and get as much done as I can and before we go to the code I'm gonna fill you in on the steps needed before we launch because we're getting close close enough that that list of steps is not that long so let's do that let me get it pulled over on on the screen here alright so I'm gonna copy and paste this into my editor I think if it'll let me know I think it's gonna let me know alright I just have to bring it over and copy all right there we go I was trying to copy a checklist from Google keep and evidently you it doesn't let you so but you can copy it to a Google Doc so here's my todo list that I've just named to do today because every day is today so then I don't have to change the name for different days of the week so hopefully you can you can see this list here's some stuff that I've had on here previously and yes I do have to remind myself to eat that is on my list several times so here's what's what's left so let's finish the faculty page component we're going to do that in today's stream or at least get pretty close and I'll finish up later so that should be done then we're going to update that faculty list component so we just need to plug in that data that we've got so that should be pretty easy because we can just copy and paste a lot of what we've done in the faculty component into the faculty this component so those two there's a good chance these two it could be done today all right we need to pull in that data for those sample schedules so if you remember a few streams ago we made that sample schedule component and we weren't using real data right we brought in some data and we need to get that data from WordPress since we we did a couple of streams on trying to get that data into our graph QL from from WP graph QL to make it work with that plugin couldn't get that to work so to me I see that as a big time sink that I don't have time for right now so I'm gonna put that on hold and I'm just gonna go with what I know works we're gonna get that data from the REST API unfortunately it's gonna mean that we have to make to API calls per page on the pages that have these schedules one for the graph QL one for the REST API but I think that it is going to be faster to implement than trying to modify some WordPress plugins at least for me at this point it is I need to doublecheck the menu links on the top and side nav I've noticed sometimes when I'm clipping clicking around is taking me to the wrong page so I'm not sure why that's happening I need to go in and doublecheck just to see what's going on and then I'd like to push all the changes to dev so this needs to happen by the end of the day today so I don't know if I'll get through all these but definitely by the end of the day today I want to push changes to that dev trance ISKCON university so that that's uptodate I can't remember the last time I I put the changes there and I need to get this link out to some people at the University so we can't go live until I get approval from some people so that's that's kind of gonna be a hold up for us so where my boss is trying to schedule that meeting right now he's thinking we might not be able to get the meeting until the first week of August so that makes our launch date maybe the second week of August somewhere around there and I mean if we can get the meeting in sooner that'd be awesome but that's no matter whether the site's done or not before then we can't launch until so approval so other thing we want to do is create a floating side menu so I have all the data I need now for those menus and we'll create that if you're not sure what that is don't worry about it we'll stream about that and then we'll put the data in for that we need to finish that search component and I've got new data in for the search URLs as I mentioned yesterday and so my student workers are working on completing that data once that's completed we can pull the data in we should be able to finish that search page and then we need to make sure that our search inputs on the side nav and on the top nav for desktop that bar you know they actually work and I need to build a custom admissions landing page so I've sketched out just in my notebook some designs for this so I just need to follow those sketches to build out a landing page because the basically the admissions department needs to approve this website before it goes live because it's going to this website will most directly impact the work that they're doing since it's geared towards incoming students so that's who I have to get a meeting with the vice president of admissions and the Director of Admissions need to sign off on that so I want to make that particular page look as good as possible and then finally the advance if I have time I want to add that advanced custom field data to WP graph QL so I don't have to use the REST API and make multiple API calls so that's it I'm sure I'll find other stuff in the site then he's done but basically the this is the step to launch to launching everything so I get all these done get approval and the site can launch alright so just wanted to give you all an overview I know I do get asked somewhat frequently when the site's going to launch by people at the University and by by you all you know in the stream or in social media so I just wanted to give you a heads up on that okay let me start my Pomodoro timer and we can get started on on this which yesterday I don't know that we had this data in here so here's what I've done since yesterday so hey everyone I see some of you in the in the chat don't want to leave you hanging hey what's going on today is there is there a soccer or football on today again I get no viewers when this football Stevens has come to Austin and gets let's get some ramen that would be awesome I'm a big fan of ramen and I haven't had it in so long partly because I was on a diet for a while but my my weight is pretty good right now so I definitely need some ramen ok so here's what I did I added in these fields for just just a bunch of spans for all those different things you can see here the job title email phone number and then that that curriculum vitae that CV field but I added in the check so we had talked yesterday about making sure we need to check to see if that date is actually there so that's what I've added in here is a just a check to see like does that exist if it does exist and then get it so what I'm gonna do to test this out is I'm gonna go in and take away some data so let's just let's take out this phone number and update so we will no longer have a phone number and hopefully the page won't break what's why doesn't know let me update I may have to log in again alright cool what worked that time alright so let's go back here refresh all right cool so look the the phone number didn't show up at all but you can see we didn't get an error because we've checked here and we're only conditionally trying to render the value of that field alright so if there is if this exists then we get the value and we put that in our span tag if it doesn't exist nothing happens right so that's what we need that a check for each thing in here so we probably will need to do that as well for all this up here to will we yeah we will but for now let's just get this formatting sorted so let me put that phone number back in Update okay cool so we should have the number again great alright so here's what I'm thinking in terms of getting is you know looking better I did some I already did some updates on fonts making these these headers a little bit nicer these headers are way too small so I still need these are eight sixes so we need to up that for sure this this text here the main text is at 18 pixels I believe that these h3s are also around 18 pixels as well at least I I think yeah so I mean maybe if I just if I bump this up a little bit it should work I want to keep that visual hierarchy but I don't want things to get like so huge that it's kind of ridiculous so we'll probably play around with the CSS on these just a bit see what looks right but you can see these are outside of our container so we just need to move our container class up a level so it encompasses all of this and that's going to bring this all into alignment I definitely don't want the default link styling so we're gonna apply some of the the link styling that we've already we already have kind of across the board on the site we're just going to make sure that applies to this as well and then we're going to display all this information you know kind of stacked on top of each other so that's the plan right now let's deal with the easiest things first so here our content div let's see if it's a steady content so we have we've said this div with the data attest ID of content we're given a max width of 90% margin0 auto so let's do this differently I wonder what we didn't put this in some of these other styles oh because we have no Styles at all all right then well you know what we can do we didn't put any styles into here before because we were pulling all the markup end but now we we can change that so we can pull out some of these so let's just copy over us from a different component some of our styles here okay faculty what do you all think is it better to put our styles at the top of the component or at the bottom of the component I always put them at the top but the other project that I was working on by the way I finished my work my piece of the work for the balance app so there's still more to be done so I'm not sure when it's gonna launch but I'm finished with that now so hopefully I'll free up a little bit of time for me but anyway when I was working on that they had the styles underneath and I kind of liked that because you don't when you start to get a lot of styles it it's a lot of scrolling before you actually get to the component so I don't know let's try to put them down below for now and just kind of see see how that how that go see how we like it all right so let's see what cost can only be used in a Dutch that's ridiculous okay I so don't need root here I need let's just call this content I'm sorry container make this container I want to see with you what y'all think about the styles here so I'm going to the chat just for a second Steven says I prefer the bottom I feel like it's more convenient if you need to come in and make changes how many styles in every matters nikki says four styles as long as you're consistent over the entire app all the top are all at the bottom okay yeah I do I like that I know we've done everything at the top so far it wouldn't really be that big of a deal to switch things to the bottom just a little copy and pasting so I don't know I'm gonna try it out on the bottom I kind of like it and then if I really do like it we want to stick with it I'll make an issue about changing the styles and then maybe somebody will come in and do it and if not at some point when I get some some time I'll go do it or maybe each time I open up a new component make an edit I'll flip the styles of that component to the bottom you know I mean there's there's just there's a couple of ways we can make that happen but for today we'll try it try it here and I'm I am a little bit concerned as to why it's telling me that I can't use Const that's really weird am i putting this in the wrong oh you know what it might it shouldn't affect cost but it might be mad that I put this inside of here okay that should be better container and we can put in max with 100% nope that's the wrong thing max with 90% and margin yeah Auto all right cool now we can go to this div and add style equals Styles the container set out there we go and I believe we can get rid of this data test ID I don't think we need that anymore and we can also get rid of it in here oops you know what we got to do this media query as well I can never remember the syntax for a media query in when we're doing styles like this but I know we've used it elsewhere so let's go with I think what would be the fastest way to do this maybe just look it up in material UI because I can't remember what component I did this in media queries with with nucleus there we are okay so we can use these theme breakpoints so just copy and paste that here yeah and we had a 600 pixel let me see what these points equate to alright small is 600 pixels or larger so yep that corresponds awesome exactly what we need down all right so we don't went down we went up so we want small which is 600 pixels and up we're gonna give it a max width of 70 70% anything below that the max was going to be 90 all right and then that way we don't have these huge white gaps on small screens that are just way too big save that see how it's working oops let's take this out first okay syntax error that's weird all right why is it giving me that I've done something wrong well since we have this on the screen already let's look up how it was done your con styles well they have styles equal steam with styles do I need that with Styles I not have that on this component I do not okay yeah I don't we can just grab with wait a second go through it with data there we go with styles I didn't see it in here before oh it's all the way at the top okay when I first copy this over I looked here to see if there's something else I need and just did not see that one okay throw that in there and then we need to change up how we're gonna do this so I'm gonna copy everything over and then just adapt what's down here so rude okay so she should be able to just do this add in another yep there we go alright let's see if it works now still doesn't work come on Hey in is here how's it going inner thanks for joining us shoot what am I doing wrong oh you know what let's see where's a page from actually using this not another sample schedule styles so oh I know I know I put two brackets instead of just one so if I was going to actually put like an inline style here I do need two brackets because the second set of brackets would mean it's a it's an object but I'm not trying to put an object in here I'm trying to put in a variable a constant so that was my problem I mean the other stuff of importing I would have to have done that anyway so I'm glad I put that in theme is not defined what oh did I use I think I need the theme for the break points to work and where's let's see how we do that here styles theme and I'm gonna put everything in an arrow function okay all right all right one more time all right cool what works but it no it's not all right let's see where is assistive alright let's see what we did okay so on this div we put this style these containers styles and those were the same styles that we had over here we just brought him over okay that's kind of weird so I'm assuming it's this div but it looks like there's no the styles that we want to be applied there or not being applied and let me go back to the console we're not getting any warning thats related to that to let this week has been rough on the streams things that should just happen that are very simple that we've done a million times are just not working okay alright let me go back to here and see who's done Oh okay well there's one thing I messed up I put this outside when it should have been inside see that makes any difference at all so nothing okay see and see how they apply these ah this is why because stars I don't know so this doing it like this works here but I think we need to do it like this now let me doublecheck that yeah so we need to have these classes and then add this as a class name so I guess we can do it right here at the top if we do it in the renderer yeah crops is not defined there we go it worked this time see there we go 70 and then once we get a little bit smaller see it it changes to 90 all right wonderful at least everything's on a row that was rough oh so rough okay so my time is almost up I'm gonna go to the live chat in just a second and check the questions and then we'll get back to the code and I'm gonna take a drink of G fuel try to get my brain working so I've been having morning meetings like really long morning meetings for the last three days this is my last day and it just kind of kills you like right in the morning like your brain is just I don't know for me like after a long meeting my brain is done so I try to like combat that I've been working out every morning but like you work out your pumps you know and then you just sit for like an hour and a half and anyway I'm making excuses for my for my bad Cody all right not that much in the chat so I'll probably get through this all within the fiveminute break Rubin says hey Jesse handsome as always is graph QL a database itself or does it use something else I really like the way you ask that question started out by calling me handsome I will just say this in general it's normally not a great idea to you know talk about somebody's looks when it's off topic but in my case I'm always very flattered by comments about my look so I'm cool with that but I just I give the disclaimer because I know there's especially a lot of female coders who constantly get comments about their looks and it's I mean it's not they don't want that that kind of attention I'm not saying all people don't want that attention but I'm saying there are some female coders who get a lot of that and it's it's unwanted so anyway so just just surround it for me it's cool but that doesn't make it cool for everybody but anyway Rubin totally awesome I love that that way you ask that question and graph qo is not a database right it's it's like an API right so like rest is not a database but it's a way to get data from a database does that make sense all right Nikki says do you need to do that check so here's the check we were doing here saying do we have to do that check like graph QL will return know and react will just ignore suffice know you'll get empty span tags so yeah I keep the check yeah so we potentially would get empty span tags but also I don't know that's kind of a good question I don't want to take any more time to test it out I'm gonna keep them in there for now but what I found before and maybe this is different because of the way that data gets in there is what would happen then in the data that we're getting from let me pull this over like we're getting this data and we would end up having like the email field would say email field null here and it wouldn't have value so it wouldn't say value no it would say email field no and that's where we would get the error because it would say like basically like we're trying to look this up that doesn't exist and I'd get an error message does that make sense or even worse sometimes the data comes in and like this is just gone completely but I think this should be good well we know this works we know it's good we took out the data and it's still work so but I mean at the very least it does save us actually no we're still getting empty span tags the way I did it here I need to do it like this and actually put the span tag inside of this so we might change that I mean if I have an empty span tag it's not the end of the world but it's probably better practice not to have it I see this is already going out to lunch with some team members we'll have to catch the replay when I get back got to get that ramen enjoy the ramen I wish it was me and it says I'm fine how goes your day Jesse yeah it not bad I got in a good workout this morning and got to my meeting on time I actually fit into a pair of pants that I haven't fit into for a long time so that was good they were still a little like tight so I'm not sure how tight is too tight for guys wearing pants so I went with a different pair but I was high excited that I can actually get him on and button him up so if that sounds weird to you I've been I was on a diet been working out recently so that's the exciting news for me so anyway so my name's Ben I've been ok so far thank you for asking Oh Nicki already pointed out that I'll still get empty span tags yeah you're right I will still get empty span tags so maybe we should change that up now yeah so let's change this let's get rid of these fantex and let's throw in after this end and then here there we go so now what will happen is the the entire span will be there or not depending on whether or not this field is there well cool you know what honestly I'm super curious now whether or not we even need this check so I really want to try this so the easiest way to do this right now it's just to actually is to render this twice so this one will have the check this one won't have the check and we'll see what happens so right now we should get it twice which we forgot to put there we go I needed to put brackets in here so we were back in JavaScript land and these would then be variables so they're being interpreted as strings and just add it in there we go okay so we should have yep two email addresses and you know what I'm I'm just gonna add some some styles on here right now because this is annoying me what am I going to call this info row and for now we'll just go displayblock so this should give us what we need so just for now at least okay if that look crazy I'll just explain I use multiple cursors so I was able to highlight multiple instances of the same thing and then type it out at one so all I really did was just added class name classes info row two for span tags and that's just as display block to all of those come on there we go okay now it's it's easier to read so we can clearly see that here we have the email address twice now onto the test let's remove this well not phone number we're doing email address this time let's remove the email address update this see what happens and we're testing to see are basically we're testing our error checking to see like is this even an issue hmm okay good to know it's not an issue so I guess that Nikki was right let's go to our our content here and let me grab this data again and no that's not how many are they'd given me not enough let's see if I can get faculty where the is it name No I can't remember the syntax for this area name and the scrap name here should be this you know what let's just go with slug because I know for sure slug will be consistent it's not gonna work yeah ah let's see it works because if if the thing he tried a span tried to access something from Nall your console would probably throw an error okay yeah let's just check the console maybe I won't need to do this you know what it still rendered these but it's just rendering them empty so I wonder if see that's what I want to see what how the values coming back oh you know what what am I thinking we already have this here where name equals there we go and that's okay and now we'll say this choice now all right there we are so now it's the email field value and it gives us a value that's just it's nothing okay so because that's the way the data comes up we don't need to do any checks at least not on these now the the place where we definitely need checks is here in our media details because you can see like there potentially could be other sizes here and then they would either just exist or not exist at all so that's where we need the checks so we could we can either keep the checks here if we really want to keep out empty spans we can add to this so we could say let's go to our ends you affect me phone field value is not equal to like all right see that way there we are so now it's not rendering empty empty spans all right wonderful so now we're no longer rendering empties fans and we can get to styling this great so we started the styling process a bit here already oops let me make sure I put this back in this email no I believe it was s oops it that's pretty much how all the email gestures go around here so I'm just gonna go with that so yeah so name position email phone number CV down here great so do are we using grid here already we're not right disk full with your icons why we have this I don't know why we have that in there let's take that out we need we need to import grid so let's pull it in from here now we can use grid and now let's copy and paste some of the stuff we did win in the sample schedule I'll copy and paste it into here and we're gonna put this grid around yeah it's yeah yeah we don't want it to be the everything in the grid container we want to make this grid so before we get to this content here we're gonna do a closing tag for our our grid container and we're also gonna add a closing well that the first one would be for the grid item and this one is going to be the grid container all right so now that works and we want to make sure after right after the image we also close the grid the grid item and then we open a new grid item we'll copy this and throw that in there and we're gonna change these styles we're gonna change we don't need the key so let's save it there we are okay interesting all right let's switch it up a bit I want to move this outside of our grid so what that there we are now we have the info down a bit lower I don't know that I really like that will mess with a little bit more but now that I know what I'm looking at it I don't know Nikki says I don't need is not equal to an empty string because an empty string is falsie all right cool I was wondering about that and I'm really glad that it is did you ever go with like you think something will work one way but you know it will work another way and instead of looking it up you just go with the way you know will work that was one of those that's one of those times it's probably not the best thing to do but if you're trying to get something done fast you know you just you do it right extra few characters in there but really it only took a few a second or so alright all right so here's what I'm not sure about so if we were to make this screen bigger right then you would have this stuff all the way over here I mean does that even make sense you could flip it around the other way maybe that would make more sense I don't know let me know what you think in the chat I'm I'm kind of stuck here on on styling on what makes more sense I mean for mobile like this works I like this I mean I don't think it looks that good but like it it makes sense it needs some styling though but then on desktop there's just all this space here all right I just need to make a decision so we need to get it done all right I'm gonna leave it like this for now we'll do a little bit of styling see if it looks better once we get this cleaned up a bit you know what we do have the class on these rows here so let's just start adding it right in here all right so I definitely want font size let's go with 20 20 pixel font size and 1 i spaced a bit so I'm gonna say margin bottom right because I don't I don't want to have I want it to line up with the image right on the top so I don't want to have this weird thing so I'm just gonna put margin on the bottom and I'm gonna go with 8 pixels let's see what we get all right not bad not bad let's see what it looks like when we go down actually whenever they were we'll never really see a screen more narrow than that and we could let's just run it like this all right let me know what you all think um I'm happy with that for now let's see Nietzsche says definitely these kinds of things you need time if you're not careful so I still love them and bump the line height of the info text next to the picture add some margin bottom to e settle a nicer Oh perfect this because of the delay Nicki had sent that message before I said it but that's awesome that we're on the same page there okay actually I think this is fine this is not the most beautiful thing I've ever designed and developed here but considering number one it looks a heck of a lot better than what we had and we don't have a lot of time so I think this is fine for now so the only other things we should do on these pages is clean this up a bit and also increase font size right now let's check the font size on this right now and we're just going to go in and change there we go our eightsix is you know what I totally didn't realize that I had the font size on this stuff so small sorry for that okay so what our eightsix let's change our font size too all right let's see what eighteen looks like 18 pixels actually you know what I really liked that I liked 18 let's go with that so I actually have this in the CSS because remember these are coming from the content that we're pulling in so we need to put it in the CSS file it's six oops need a separated out h6 font size 20 wait 18 18 pixels so 18 pixels I believe is the same size as the rest of the text on that page but because we have that font weight there it definitely looks like it's it's a heading right that's what we want and I want to check the what I have for these h3 cuz they should be bigger than an h6 and computed font size see it's slightly bigger so let's let's change those h threes let's bump those up to 20 okay not a huge thing but it's definitely 20 so that was a little over one pixel difference but I definitely you know I want that change since we we bump this up and then clearly I believe that's an h1 that's clearly you know bigger than these so I think this is fine for now okay cool that works so that's taken care of now we just need this let's go can we do this there's I definitely have some some CSS in another CSS file to handle links so in this particular component we're pulling in just the faculty dot CSS but I believe we had a CSS file that included just kind of Universal styles is anybody is anybody listening to the throwbackthursday playlist for today on Spotify it sounds like it's all 90s rock music but it's nice it's nostalgic that's what I have on right now it's oh here we are is it page is that the one yeah all right so the style sheets need they're a bit of a mess now they definitely need some work so for now I'm just gonna copy and paste this over instead of pulling all these styles in by that I mean instead of actually importing a separate style sheet I'd rather not do that and I know I bet I've been saying like we need to do this project fast I don't have time to clean these up you know so but that time that needs to come before they get too too crazy so let's see if this works you know what it's alright it will work yeah but realistically this is its own component so we could probably take this and put it in put it here but there could be links within this content that we're getting so we're gonna need that anyway so I'm not at this point gonna duplicate those Styles here so here's the view CV you know it's at the bottom it's kind of out of the way but I think that's fun we had a discussion about this yesterday I I don't think we should be highlighting hey you know download this PDF alright great cool and then what I'll do after the stream is I'm going to assign to my student workers to look through all of the profiles all the profiles for these professors and let me know which ones look really weird if there's something going on in this content area that I don't know what kind of markup they could have some professors I think had like YouTube embeds and stuff so they'll let us know and that'll save us a lot of time in testing but they'll let us know if we need to account for anything else any other type of markup all right wonderful and my timers up so that's perfect timing so let's before I go back to the chat and answer questions let's commit this and push it up to the main repo and I'm you know what I just now realize that I am running angry and I could have given you all the link but I guess I'll throw it in there right now if you want to just kind of see what's what's happening very sorry about that I was right before I started the stream I was like remember the N growling and then I didn't remember it all right but let's get this committed so let's do it get status just to doublecheck what we've changed so yep we updated that quick well I updated this query before like a few minutes before we started we updated that faculty j/s the CSS great so let's do a git add atom all the yarn cm and yarn cm you probably don't have that on your project it's a little custom thing it's a little custom thing to help you create a well formatted commit message so otherwise you just want to type in git commit with the little m flag so get commit m and then you can put your message in in quotes let's see we really just styled this right yeah and I don't think we have an issue about this so I'm not gonna bother with that okay so while that does its thing runs all the tests does the auto formatting I'm going to go to the chat please put your questions in the chat now if you have any questions for me to answer once I get through everything in the chat I'm going to end the stream all right great now I'll push this get push awesome now all this code is available to you on the github repo that's linked in the description so just check it out if you go into that repo you can go into the the pages folder and then go into that faculty j/s and that's where we did most of the work but feel free to use that for whatever you want or add or correct anything that I messed up all right okay actually not that much in the live chat so should be pretty quick free rack says I need to learn react well yeah if you're interested in learning reacts you can definitely watch these streams to check it out but there's also some videos I think Bo Carnes did a react intro video series sorry for the awning and that's on our Channel right now there's a react interest series on learn code academies so it's will Stern's YouTube channel and then the react documentation is great for learning it so that's what I would recommend free code camp has some react stuff now in their in their challenges as well Elon Musk says hello hello Elon thanks for joining oh yeah and it looks like Ilan was also wanting to know how to learn react stuff so yeah so those stuff that I just said is probably a really good place to start I've heard that there's also like I did the Udacity react nano degree if you're interested in spending some money to get more formal training check that out I a lot of people like West bosses courses I've never done one of his courses but he's done react stuff react training has has some courses so I haven't done all these things I just heard good things about them but yeah there's a lot out there so but I would say like check out some of the stuff that I mentioned because I I know I've either done it myself or I've heard that they're really good alright ambition says can you explain what WebKit and prefixes are used for yes so when browsers don't support something in CSS sometimes they'll alright so this is my I don't Lee this explanation gonna be very official but essentially like using those prefixes from a developer standpoint that's a way to make things work in browsers where things aren't like officially supported by default right so what is it the Moz prefix and I don't even remember all the prefixes usually I there's I use things that auto prefix so I don't worry about it but if you use those prefixes then you can get what you're trying to do in CSS to work so if you try to use it without the prefix and someone's using one of those browsers that need it then that part of your CSS just it'll be ignored and the reason behind it right I don't know technically how it's all done the reason is just that different browser support different things in CSS officially but they sometimes will have like I don't like a workaround to use it right before it becomes official and is officially supported it's it's I guess tested out behind this this prefix this vendor prefix correct me if I'm wrong about all that I just know that it works and how to make it work I don't you know what I'm saying like I don't know the whole reasoning behind it but I believe that's it but anyway a lot of times you can find like a plugin that will work with web pack or gulp or you know whatever you're using that will take your CSS and automatically add prefixes to it so you don't even have to worry about which prefixes to use and it keeps your CSS nice and clean because the stuff you actually work with doesn't have the prefixes it gets added in later on and you never have to see it so that's that's really cool because the prefix stuff can get pretty crazy if you're using a lot of things that need a lot of free fixes Nietzsche says question what snack should I order to go with my french fries I mean with like typically like you get a hamburger right with french fries isn't that that's classic so I would say that it's really hot where I'm at if it's hot where you're right maybe get like a milkshake or an ice cream cone I don't know depending on where you're at in the world but where I'm at there's this fast food chain called Wendy's and you keep they have these kind of like milkshake things called Frosty's and I know it's popular to get a chocolate frosty and then dunk your french fries in it and eat your french fries so I don't mean salt and chocolate definitely go together right so people have done that I do it occasionally I'm not I'm more of a fan of you know catch up with the fries not so much to frosty with my fries but if you don't want the hamburger then I recommend getting some sort of ice cream based treat especially if it's hot and that me that's not healthy advice either so if you if you get if you have health problems because of eating too much junk food then please don't blame me Jacob says maybe you should do a separate design for mobile and desktop I didn't watch at all yes so we do have some but we have design differences between mobile and desktop for sure so the site but most of the site has been designed with mobile as the primary focus and then things just kind of scale up for a desktop yeah but so the design is it's there's not two completely different designs but we just use media queries to change things up when we need to all right Nicky says check out the free beginner course the beginner react course by Kent C Dodds on egghead what'd I say it's like egghead IO is the address all right so I haven't done that course but nicky recommends that also Tyler McGinnis did a good series on YouTube about starting with react okay cool so check those up Avinash this just came what are you building oh we were working on mainly styling a react component using some CSS today and it's part of a much larger project that's been going on for I don't know like six months going on seven months now so yeah at this point I mean this this strain is gonna be available to to watch you know a few minutes after it's over it'll be posted on the free code camp YouTube channel so you know feel free to go back and watch to know more exactly about what we did mmm Nietzsche says Vicki burger it is very popular here in Belgium okay I've never heard of it but I've also never been to Belgium so that's probably what prereq says okay Jesse and and Brooke Brooke is Niki so I I use it interchangeably but thanks for thanks for recommending oh you're welcome no problem good luck with your with your react studies Ivan ska I'll do that is graph QL the future kind of I mean I would say graph QL is is the present and the future at this point because it's been around for a little while and more people are using it I I definitely see graph QL as being better than a rest api so be it it cuts down on the with the rest api usually you have this problem of you make one API call and you get a ton of data and a lot of it you don't even need or you have split your data out into a bunch of different endpoints and then you have to make multiple API calls to different endpoints so you don't necessarily get a bunch of extra data but you're making all these API calls either way like that's not ideal graph QL eliminates that by allowing you to make one API call get exactly the data that you want and nothing more so just that alone is a definite advantage because when you're building a website you want to minimize the amount of data and the amount of network requests that you make all right that's that's gonna help speed for your site for sure it's also gonna help you don't want to eat up people's data plans you know on their on their phone so anything you can do to get the overall size you know in megabytes of your website down is it's a good thing and the speed also you want to get that load time so I think graph QL is in that category is definitely better than a typical REST API Mustafa says reactor angular well I use react I'm I haven't used angular since angular 1 so and I've heard that the new versions of angular so different that I'm not even gonna comment on really on angular because I just don't know I I assume that angular is good a lot of people use it but around here we definitely use react and I like react so I don't really have any plans to use anything other than react any time in the in the near future I'd rather just try to specialize it right now and get get good with that a Vanessa thanks love and support from India oh thank you that's awesome Ilan says how many years of experience do you have in web development 5 6 uh I feel like I could keep saying I've had 5 years of experience for the last like 3 years I'd have to go back for sure you can check out my LinkedIn if you wanna know for sure but I'm at least 5 years Jakob says what web server is your localhost I'm not exactly sure what you want transid answer that question like you know we have webpack running handling all the stuff of being able to run stuff locally and that's like preconfigured since we're using next to build it up and I'm using n grok so that you all can check out the site so I don't know is any of that at all answering your question M LV says hey can I learn react fully for free for sure yeah there's so many free resources out there you can learn react and not spend anything Jacob asks am i using visual studio plugin yeah I'm I have a lot of plugins for visual studio if you're asking me specifically to run the localhost am i using a visual studio plugin no it's it's running through web pack so I think that that makes more sense now what you're asking MLV says how long does it take learn react it entirely depends on how much time you have to dedicate to it how much you already know about JavaScript how how smart you are in terms of being able to pick up new ideas so it's I mean I say I mean it definitely took me months before I was confident enough to like really start using reacts on on real projects like projects I was getting paid for Emily says how much of reacts what I have to know to get into backend development react is frontend so if you want to get into backend you're gonna have to learn either backend like language like PHP is widely used Ruby you could use node if you want to stick with JavaScript so yeah but react this just is just frontend I mean you can do serverside rendering with react but you're not it's not used for backend programming well why were you I think I messed this name up before let me know how to pronounce that well why are you says will I get any benefits by wrapping a REST API with graph QL or will that make the request lower I'm not sure what it would do on the server side in terms of slowness of the request but I could see clientside is that being it being better if you did have a situation where you would have to make lots of API calls with the REST API and by switching to graph QL you only cut that down to one so I guess it would depend on your situation if if using the REST API you only had to make one call you aren't getting a ton of extra data probably okay just to stick with REST API but otherwise it might work with the graph kill but I you know I have no idea what term will kind of slow down would happen on the backend by doing that if if there would be any significant slowdown I'm not sure the stuff uh says thank you for these great live streaming love and respect for Morocco oh thank you Andy I appreciate it MLV says fetch versus Axios which one is better I always use fetch I've I've heard a lot of good things about Axios but I always use fetch it's really simple in terms of like if you're doing it on the clientside and browser it's it's supported by newer browsers natively you don't have to import anything so I like that so in terms of which one is better I don't I don't know I'm sure they each have their advantages or disadvantages but since I haven't really used Axios I'm not at a good position to say which one's better alright and that's the end of the questions and we are just in time for the next stream to start so I believe at 1 p.m. Eastern Time there's going to be a live stream continuing from earlier in the week about creating Alexus skills which I've created Alexis skills before and it's really fun so if you're at all interested in that definitely check it out check out the the live stream and you know make your own skill and let me know if you do because I'll try it out thank you all so much for joining in thank you for all your help and for being patient with me as I struggled through which should have been simple simple things too and let's see trying to find my stop streaming button yeah so tomorrow tomorrow's Friday I'll probably be at home on Friday so I'm gonna try to do a stream last time I tried to stream from home though we had some technical difficulties so hopefully that doesn't happen we can work it out and get a good stream in so hopefully see y'all tomorrow maybe next week if I can't get things working right but until then have a wonderful day
