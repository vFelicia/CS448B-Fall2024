00:06 - hey everybody is Jessie and today we
00:12 - have some pool requests to go over and
00:15 - [Music]
00:17 - have to make a decision for sure this
00:21 - time of weather we're gonna use the beta
00:24 - material UI or not I know you're
00:26 - probably tired of even thinking about
00:28 - this question at this point also I today
00:36 - has been today and last night have been
00:39 - really really frustrating so since my my
00:47 - whole purpose for doing this at least at
00:51 - first was to give people a realistic
00:54 - view of what my job as a front-end
00:55 - developers like I'm gonna briefly
00:58 - explain what what the day has been like
01:02 - just to give you a more accurate picture
01:06 - so as you know I'm working on the
01:11 - udacity react nanodegree so I am I keep
01:21 - submitting my project and the way it
01:23 - works in Udacity is you submit your
01:25 - project and then they do a code review
01:27 - and then they send you feedback on your
01:30 - code and let you know if it's if it's
01:34 - working properly or not so it it hasn't
01:42 - been working properly and the first you
01:45 - know two times I submitted him okay you
01:47 - know that's legitimate it's some good
01:49 - feedback should have tested it more but
01:52 - then last night I I thought I had it I
01:56 - thought I had had gotten it and so I I
02:01 - was frustrated so I stayed up late last
02:03 - night I worked on it and then I thought
02:06 - for sure I have it the Sun I woke up
02:08 - this morning and I still didn't fix what
02:12 - I need
02:13 - I think some of it but there was still
02:16 - you know one thing that I didn't test
02:19 - and it didn't work so that is just super
02:21 - frustrating especially because I'm so
02:24 - tired today since I stayed up late to do
02:27 - that but anyway that's not that's not
02:30 - even the worst part
02:31 - so I get to work I started doing my work
02:35 - it gets right around time when I have a
02:39 - meeting right before my lunch break so
02:42 - instead of going to the meeting I just
02:46 - kind of remoted in right from my office
02:49 - so there was like a screen share thing
02:51 - set up so I remote it in late because I
02:55 - had just gotten an email from a client
02:57 - that their site was down which was
03:00 - really worrying because I set up that
03:02 - site in a similar way to what we did
03:04 - this this catechetical Institute site
03:06 - the last time so I checked it out and it
03:09 - turns out they had like a spike in in
03:13 - traffic and the database just shut down
03:17 - on the server that was running WordPress
03:20 - so I couldn't figure it out couldn't get
03:22 - it up and running spent my entire lunch
03:26 - break that I was going to spend working
03:27 - on Udacity on that luckily I still had
03:32 - the development version of that
03:35 - WordPress install on a different server
03:38 - so one one that I pay for not the
03:42 - company so I just pointed the subdomain
03:45 - to that server so that the site is now
03:47 - back up and it buys me time to figure
03:50 - out what happened with that so I'm I'm
03:53 - really interested in what happened
03:55 - because I don't want it to happen to any
03:57 - of the other sites that I built like
03:58 - that so on top of that I get an email
04:05 - from somebody who's been continually
04:08 - insisting that a site that I had built
04:10 - an internal site for for the university
04:13 - I work for they couldn't access it so it
04:16 - is you have to login to the site and I
04:19 - can't I've been trying to actually go to
04:23 - see this person at their computer and
04:25 - they've never give me a time when I
04:27 - could go to see them they've had other
04:30 - people from the IT department go there
04:32 - who of course haven't been able to fix
04:35 - it because they're not developers and
04:36 - the problem is likely you know maybe
04:39 - some type of error I don't know I don't
04:41 - really know what the problem is so I get
04:43 - another email from this person saying
04:45 - they try to login and it didn't work so
04:46 - I checked my error logs I'm not 100%
04:49 - sure yet I'll give you an update on this
04:52 - one I know for sure but this is what I
04:54 - saw when I checked my error logs around
04:58 - the same time that I got the email about
05:00 - the error I got this error log and just
05:04 - I just want to zoom in on this part so
05:12 - in case that's not immediately sinking
05:15 - in whoever got this this error was using
05:20 - Internet Explorer 9 to try to view my
05:22 - site now I don't I don't know about you
05:25 - if you all support Internet Explorer 9
05:27 - in your projects but I make no attempt
05:28 - to support Internet Explorer 9 and so
05:33 - that was just if it turns out that this
05:37 - was in fact the error message from the
05:40 - person who was trying to log in I'm
05:43 - gonna be I'm gonna be somewhat relieved
05:46 - and really annoyed at the same time not
05:49 - at this person at all I mean certainly
05:53 - you know I think most people probably
05:55 - don't even realize what version of a
05:56 - browser they're using but I will be
06:01 - super annoyed that for months now I've
06:04 - been trying to figure out this problem
06:05 - and it's potentially not even really my
06:09 - fault it's it's just the fact that it's
06:13 - you know it's Internet Explorer 9 so
06:16 - anyway that's been my day so far but
06:20 - then after all that happened my wife
06:21 - brought me pizza which was cool and I
06:23 - got to see the baby for a few minutes
06:26 - and she was being really cute so so
06:31 - anyways so that brings me to right now
06:36 - and
06:37 - I'm gonna show you the the pull request
06:39 - that I got and we have some cause for
06:43 - celebration today and I'll show you in a
06:45 - minute
06:48 - yeah Sebastian says in the live chat
06:51 - Pizza fixes everything so yeah it was it
06:54 - was good as you know I frequently just
06:57 - work and don't eat all day so it is
07:00 - really nice when I actually eat feel a
07:04 - lot better usually towards the end of
07:06 - the stream I'm just exhausted and hungry
07:08 - but today I will not be alright so let
07:12 - me let me show you I was just trying to
07:18 - think if I forgot anything I don't think
07:21 - so
07:22 - alright let me show you this pull
07:25 - request that I just merged into the
07:31 - material UI betta branch so this is from
07:37 - Rohit and sorry if I'm mispronouncing
07:40 - the name but I just wanted to especially
07:43 - show you this because this is his first
07:47 - pull request that's been accepted so you
07:53 - could check it out this was the first
07:55 - pull request and does it show up to the
08:00 - X that I accepted it
08:06 - I don't know but anyway I think I think
08:12 - that this is the first pull request that
08:14 - that he's had submitted that's been
08:19 - accepted so that's really cool so
08:21 - congratulations so basically what what
08:25 - he's managed to do is to get this site
08:30 - so obviously it's not perfect like
08:34 - there's still some weird things going on
08:37 - probably based on the mark-up that I had
08:40 - but the the point of the pull request
08:42 - was to fix those errors so this is no
08:45 - longer showing any errors all right I'd
08:47 - still need to get this working in terms
08:51 - of the side nav and you know fixing this
08:54 - positioning and things but yesterday we
08:57 - worked and worked and we couldn't even
08:58 - get to a point where we could even see
08:59 - anything except an error message so this
09:02 - is awesome so this actually makes it
09:04 - more of a possibility that we could use
09:07 - the beta I'm I still kind of don't want
09:11 - to after yesterday because that was a
09:13 - lot of work so if I run into similar
09:16 - issues I I don't really want it to slow
09:19 - me up I'm already I'm I actually
09:22 - expected to be a lot farther along at
09:24 - this point than I am so anyway so I went
09:29 - ahead and merged it into that that
09:31 - material you I beta branch just so that
09:33 - it's there because you know maybe in a
09:36 - few days we realized that the other
09:39 - version of material UI is just going to
09:40 - be too hard to work with what we want to
09:42 - do and I want to try it again or maybe
09:45 - down the road you know if I I go to redo
09:50 - this again maybe I'll want to use
09:52 - material UI beta I mean who knows but I
09:55 - thought it was worth it to have a on
09:58 - this branch a version that didn't throw
10:01 - errors immediately I never really liked
10:04 - the idea of pushing to get hub a branch
10:07 - that didn't work so thanks again roulade
10:12 - for that for that pull request and
10:18 - he actually submitted to pull requests
10:19 - so the first one was a theme fix but at
10:22 - least for me it through an error and I
10:24 - think the only thing was it was just it
10:27 - had a lot of stuff from the master
10:30 - branch that it wasn't the beta so it
10:33 - just wasn't working right and then you
10:35 - know almost immediately after I made
10:38 - some comments on the first pull request
10:41 - he came back with this with a second one
10:43 - so that was really awesome oh hey cool
10:49 - really it's in the live chat so and says
10:55 - thank you so much for accepting the pool
10:56 - request you're welcome thank you for
10:58 - submitting that I'm actually I'm really
11:00 - I'm excited for two things one that you
11:02 - submitted the pool question was awesome
11:04 - also that it's your first pour across I
11:07 - think it's really cool that I got to to
11:10 - accept that like that that's a big deal
11:12 - to me all right so I'm gonna check the
11:16 - live chat quickly just to say hi to
11:17 - everyone all right so if you are if
11:23 - you're new welcome and thanks for
11:28 - watching so this this show in case you
11:36 - haven't watched before is me doing my
11:39 - normal everyday work so there will be
11:40 - mistakes and some days it seems like
11:42 - it's all mistakes but we usually manage
11:45 - to work through the problems eventually
11:47 - and build some cool things so I'm gonna
11:53 - try to keep up with the live chat and
11:55 - every so often I'm gonna check back in
11:57 - so if you ask a question I don't get to
11:58 - it right away please don't don't be
12:01 - upset by that I will get to it and if
12:04 - you can't stick around I'll still try to
12:05 - answer it you can watch the recording
12:06 - later and get the answer so basically if
12:13 - you haven't seen the other streams for
12:15 - this project we're building a react
12:17 - project we use create react app to build
12:19 - it you know start it and then we're
12:22 - using material UI which is a material
12:25 - design framework for
12:28 - or for building the layout in react apps
12:34 - so this is my first time using the tear
12:37 - UI so we're still we're kind of learning
12:40 - as we go
12:43 - also there's two other ways to
12:46 - participate in this stream today so of
12:49 - course I have the Instagram feed that is
12:52 - showing my face
12:53 - whenever I'm whenever I'm doing this and
12:56 - I have a cool you can barely see in the
12:59 - background but today I turned on my
13:00 - little plasma ball a USB flash my ball
13:04 - so I guess if it was darker you could
13:08 - see it more but anyway it's cool my kids
13:10 - always like to play with it when they
13:11 - come to my office so if you are already
13:15 - watching on Instagram and you don't
13:17 - realize that you can see the code on
13:18 - youtube check out free code cancer
13:20 - YouTube channel and then there's a third
13:23 - way so I mentioned that I had n Drock
13:30 - working so let me give you the link and
13:37 - you should be able to see the site as I
13:41 - am developing it so I'm gonna paste this
13:44 - link in the live chat but if you're not
13:49 - in the live chat or you're watching this
13:50 - later on which I'll probably keep and
13:55 - rock on so there's a chance if you're
13:58 - watching it a little bit later on today
13:59 - you can still see the site but it won't
14:02 - be on all the time so if you are
14:04 - watching it later and it doesn't work
14:05 - then my computer's off or something but
14:09 - otherwise you know you might have a shot
14:11 - if you're watching maybe an hour or two
14:13 - after so here's the link in the live
14:21 - chat Blake asks about the Instagram feed
14:24 - it's there should be a link in the
14:26 - description to this video my Instagram
14:28 - name I think is Jessie dot Weigel so
14:32 - cool I can see that you all are actually
14:36 - trying to view this so that's awesome so
14:39 - if you remember we tried to do this
14:41 - maybe
14:41 - month ago maybe more and it just
14:45 - immediately like shut down because we
14:48 - hit the limit on the amount of requests
14:50 - so I explained a few days ago I think
14:52 - that the person who does end ruk and I
14:59 - think his name's Alan let me double
15:02 - check I want to give this guy credit
15:04 - because I really appreciate it so I'm
15:07 - I'm actually gonna check my my email
15:09 - right now to make sure that I get his
15:11 - name right and I'll probably put
15:17 - something on Twitter to thanking him
15:19 - since that's how he first reached out to
15:21 - me I think it was Outland yeah so Alan
15:30 - Shrieve who is I don't know if he's I
15:37 - don't know exactly what he is with n
15:39 - Grunk if he made it if he's in charge of
15:41 - of maintaining it I'm not sure but
15:43 - anyway he basically just hooked us up
15:47 - saying you know that this will work so I
15:50 - don't know what he said the Linnet too
15:51 - but it looks like it's working fine
15:54 - I haven't normally I would have gotten a
15:56 - message to say it said it crashed ok so
15:59 - right now we got a lot of connections
16:01 - and it seems to be working so so that's
16:09 - that's awesome
16:10 - so now I'll run this you know whenever
16:13 - pretty much anytime I stream and you all
16:17 - can just immediately see the feedback of
16:21 - what's going on so that should really
16:22 - help you know you got you can open up
16:24 - dev tools now and see the same errors
16:26 - and inspect things and you won't have to
16:28 - just see what's on my screen so
16:31 - hopefully that'll make this way more
16:33 - interactive I mean there's already a lot
16:35 - of interaction in the live chat and
16:37 - that's awesome but I think this was this
16:40 - was a really really good idea I think it
16:42 - was Fabian's idea a while back so Fabian
16:45 - hesitant I don't think he's been able to
16:47 - join in in the live chat for a while I
16:49 - haven't seen him I might have seen him
16:52 - last week or something but
16:54 - so he's probably not watching now but if
16:57 - he does watch this thank you for this
16:59 - idea it was for really awesome all right
17:02 - so enough of all the the introductory
17:06 - stuff I'm gonna switch for now I think
17:13 - I'm gonna switch back to the master
17:15 - branch so like I said earlier I'm I just
17:19 - I don't want to do anything with the
17:23 - beta right now so it was really I don't
17:28 - know it was really like a little bit
17:30 - frustrating yesterday when I tried to
17:33 - work on it and we just couldn't get it
17:34 - working so I don't want to repeat of
17:36 - that so I'm gonna switch back to the
17:38 - master branch let me do this on the
17:44 - screen so I can see this so so if you're
17:50 - not that familiar with git you want to
17:51 - switch branches you do get check out and
17:53 - then you do the name of the branch okay
17:58 - so now I've switched to the master
18:00 - branch and I want to make sure cuz I
18:04 - don't think I've done pushed anything up
18:06 - oops get pull not masterful oh all right
18:13 - so get pool so it's always fresh
18:14 - whenever you start out it you always
18:17 - want to do a get pool just in case even
18:19 - if you're the only person working on it
18:21 - it's possible that you might have pushed
18:23 - something from another computer and you
18:25 - just forgot that's actually happened to
18:27 - me that's happened to me during the
18:31 - livestream now because I frequently work
18:35 - on a laptop when I'm not in my office so
18:42 - let me move this out of here and let's
18:50 - see
18:52 - run yarn just make sure the package is
18:56 - so different packages switching back and
18:59 - forth between branches and let me
19:03 - restart this server as well so it's it's
19:09 - showing an error right now that's why
19:10 - I'm doing all this so that should fix it
19:21 - alright so here we go
19:25 - we're back to this we have this little
19:29 - highlight here working thanks to
19:31 - Sebastian's pull request everything
19:35 - that's showing up here is a different
19:37 - component so you know as it should be in
19:41 - react you know all these little pieces
19:43 - that you see are all separate components
19:47 - so you know this app bar is separate and
19:50 - then we the side nav is is all separate
19:54 - and then this section here is totally
19:56 - separate so that's the way we want it so
20:01 - now I think we ought to build out the
20:08 - the home view so why not why not start
20:12 - there that's the first page everyone
20:13 - will see so we'll start right there and
20:17 - I guess we could change the title to
20:23 - that's the only other like really
20:24 - obvious thing that we could change is
20:26 - it's obviously not going to be title so
20:29 - let's yeah let's change that I want to
20:38 - start out with a win I know if I change
20:40 - that it won't cause an error and that'll
20:43 - be one one thing that we can say even if
20:47 - everything else fails at least we get
20:48 - that done so where am I
20:56 - I know this is sad enough now that
21:01 - everything is in components I'm not sure
21:03 - where it if where the title is an app
21:11 - all right app are there we go I'm pretty
21:16 - sure I made this component so maybe I
21:20 - did maybe that's why I didn't realize
21:21 - maybe this isn't one Sebastian made oh
21:29 - wait a second it should not be like this
21:47 - I think it's is it holding on I'm going
21:53 - to close out a bunch of this stuff
21:58 - occasionally when I check out and switch
22:02 - from a branch the code editor doesn't
22:04 - immediately switch everything over and
22:06 - it holds on to the to the old markup so
22:13 - in particular for that one it was still
22:18 - showing the code that we weren't even
22:25 - using anymore at all so let's try I
22:28 - think it's sad enough yep that's it so
22:32 - it's inside enough this this makes more
22:35 - sense this is how it should look
22:36 - alright so let's change it to resource
22:42 - center and I think Sebastian also
22:51 - submitted a poor request but he
22:53 - basically said in the the comments for
22:58 - the for his request that it would
23:04 - probably just be better to go with a
23:05 - stable version so that's why I didn't
23:07 - even I didn't I didn't pull it in but I
23:12 - think he actually did change the title
23:16 - least I thought he did I don't maybe
23:19 - maybe he didn't I don't know now that I
23:21 - look at it on my other screen I don't
23:22 - see that so I don't know where I'm
23:24 - getting that from all right so let's
23:29 - check it out it's this resource center
23:31 - awesome ok
23:40 - so since we don't have column classes
23:44 - built-in to the the material UI the
23:51 - version of material you I that we're
23:52 - using I I kind of think we should I
23:58 - think we ought to use some of the stuff
24:01 - from materialized because already
24:06 - familiar with that so here's what I'm
24:08 - thinking that we could use assuming that
24:13 - there's not a lot of conflicts between
24:15 - class names which we'll have to double
24:18 - check that we may be able to just blend
24:20 - these two not use any of the any of the
24:26 - jQuery related stuff for JavaScript
24:29 - related stuff at all from materialized
24:31 - but basically just take their column
24:35 - classes and use that so if there's any
24:38 - objections to that let me know I just
24:41 - would rather not have to build out a
24:43 - column class system if I don't have to
24:47 - like from scratch because I already know
24:51 - how much the materialized system works
24:53 - I'm really familiar with it
25:03 - now I just checked back in the live chat
25:06 - and I see Sebastian saying please change
25:09 - the active color Patrick Gass please
25:11 - tell me that bright yellow is a
25:13 - placeholder yeah yeah the brainy the
25:17 - bright yellow is definitely a
25:19 - placeholder tor
25:24 - I don't know if it's supposed to be tor
25:27 - tor aI don't know but says maybe you
25:30 - should create two folders component in
25:31 - container to store your code yeah
25:33 - actually I had I had created a component
25:38 - folder when I was trying to get the beta
25:40 - to work and so I obviously that that
25:48 - didn't happen so I do I am going to
25:49 - create a folder to hold the components
25:51 - and organize this a little bit better so
25:55 - like I said I had done it once and then
25:57 - broke everything so that got thrown out
26:01 - when I threw out all the things that
26:03 - broke
26:21 - all right I was just checking the live
26:23 - chat there so sorry about the little
26:27 - silent time
26:35 - oh cool patrick said I love that hot
26:39 - reloading is even working over an Gras
26:43 - yeah I didn't I I figured it would work
26:47 - I wasn't really sure what to expect but
26:49 - so far this seems like really really
26:52 - useful all right so it seems like no one
26:58 - wants this bright yellow there so let's
27:00 - change that so I guess we're in the apt
27:05 - CSS yep alright so we don't want that to
27:11 - be yellow let's check out the material
27:13 - design documentation and see what it's
27:15 - supposed to be
27:28 - I could never I'm on the site often but
27:31 - I don't know why the URL doesn't come up
27:35 - when I type it in okay so that's C cool
27:42 - this is what I wanted I just wanted to
27:44 - get this the material design
27:46 - documentation seems to actually use the
27:48 - material design spec which is as it
27:51 - should be I suppose so I'm not even
27:54 - really gonna look this up I'm just going
27:55 - to inspect it and see what color they
27:58 - use that will be faster
28:23 - why is this much
28:29 - okay when I I have it on on the other
28:34 - screen I had taken it took the focus off
28:40 - so I couldn't see but this is pretty
28:43 - easy he's just using it's gray let's see
28:51 - how that looks cool all right much much
28:58 - nicer to look at and it's actually a
29:04 - different gray than what we see when we
29:06 - hover so does that bother anybody that
29:12 - gray is different I mean should it be
29:15 - different since the different thing is
29:17 - happening or should we try to make it
29:18 - the same I don't really care at this
29:22 - point I can always change that later on
29:25 - but let me know what you think if you if
29:27 - you have a preference okay cool so get
29:35 - the important things taken care of a
29:36 - title and we have a new color for the
29:39 - active link so let's let's commit that
29:44 - so we have one working commit so let's
29:48 - check our status and see we've edited
29:50 - the app CSS file and the side nav JSS
29:54 - file and I want to commit both of these
29:56 - at the same time with a commit message
29:59 - and we're gonna add them as well so to
30:01 - do that we're going to type git commit
30:04 - and then we're gonna give it the flag am
30:07 - so a is going to add it and an means
30:10 - we're going to put a message right after
30:11 - that so within quotation marks and you
30:14 - could do double or single quotes we're
30:18 - gonna put our commit message and we're
30:21 - gonna say change title
30:39 - so they're actually different I guess
30:44 - different ways to do commit messages so
30:48 - different places have guidelines for how
30:50 - you do it so right now I'm not really
30:53 - using any guidelines except that I don't
30:57 - do anything in the past tense so I don't
30:59 - ever say change title it's always
31:01 - changed title so that's pretty much what
31:04 - what I adhere to I also try to keep them
31:06 - as short as I possibly can and I usually
31:09 - don't use punctuation but sometimes I
31:11 - forget and just put in a punctuation
31:14 - mark but if you want to use something
31:17 - that's standard and I mean if you're
31:20 - just starting out and you want to start
31:22 - with good habits you can check out
31:25 - I think Udacity has their own standard
31:29 - so you can go
31:32 - I think it's available somewhere on the
31:34 - site I don't I don't know if the link is
31:36 - right now but if you check out the
31:38 - Udacity get you know commit message
31:41 - standard it's pretty straightforward if
31:44 - you're taking Udacity course they want
31:46 - you to stick to it and I'm sure there
31:50 - are other companies that have their own
31:52 - standards so I would actually recommend
31:54 - doing that so your commit messages are
31:57 - more uniform because mine are are not
32:00 - they're all over the place at some point
32:03 - I'll probably have set a standard for
32:05 - everybody in my department to use and
32:09 - potentially like everybody who
32:12 - contributes to any of the projects but
32:15 - for right now there is no standard and
32:20 - let's push this
32:25 - so we've committed this so this is only
32:28 - on our local machine if we want this to
32:30 - be to be reflected in github we got to
32:33 - push it so we do a git push origin
32:36 - master since we're on the master branch
32:38 - and now this change is reflected in
32:41 - github which is awesome because you know
32:43 - if the power goes out this computer
32:45 - shuts down we could just turn on our
32:49 - laptop and running a Wi-Fi from our
32:55 - phone and get on github and keep working
33:01 - I've actually done that before is that
33:04 - ever happen to you all
33:05 - I gotta keep my laptop here and so the
33:09 - Power has gone out and shut the computer
33:12 - down so I just opened my laptop and keep
33:14 - going alright so Zach says it's
33:23 - different and he gives he gave me the
33:26 - hex code for the color that's the real
33:32 - color so alright so because you you are
33:36 - nice enough to give me the color I'll
33:37 - change it right now so that we have the
33:41 - same color let's check it out now
33:45 - there's a networking
33:50 - oops did I mess it up wait a second
33:56 - that is not that's not the color that is
34:03 - blue
34:24 - cool Nathaniel says back when I lived in
34:30 - Snowden land Elizabeth City power
34:33 - outages were a more common thing so I
34:35 - used mobile tethering in my laptop Zack
34:43 - says sorry wasn't the color just my
34:44 - favorite one that was a good color I
34:47 - mean I like that color it's just not in
34:49 - the color palette that I can use for
34:51 - university projects actually if you
34:56 - don't mind I think I may try that color
34:58 - out on my my project for Udacity because
35:01 - I'm I wanted to use a blue color I
35:03 - picked a different shade but I really
35:05 - like that shade so maybe I'll maybe I'll
35:08 - use it I don't want to steal your color
35:10 - though cuz you you you put it in the
35:13 - chat first so I think you have dibs on
35:15 - it for a while at least alright so now
35:23 - let's let's start with some of these
35:28 - classes I guess the first thing I want
35:30 - to do is I just want to look and this is
35:36 - just on my other screen briefly at some
35:39 - of the class names that are coming out
35:44 - just to see about conflicts
35:50 - so let's look I have the material UI
35:54 - documentation here as well so see
35:59 - actually let me close that I had to do a
36:03 - performance management self-assessment
36:05 - so I think I have a meeting on Friday
36:07 - actually I should let you all know
36:10 - Friday I'm gonna have to stream at a
36:12 - different time and tomorrow I will so
36:14 - tomorrow at a normal time I'll be
36:17 - finishing up a technical interview with
36:19 - the candidate for web developer job so
36:23 - I'll probably just bump it ahead to like
36:25 - 2:30 so it won't be a big change but
36:27 - Friday everyone here gets to leave at
36:30 - noon which is awesome so I will be here
36:33 - at the normal time so maybe I'll do it
36:35 - I'll have to do it
36:36 - the early because I have my performance
36:39 - review at I think 11:30 somewhere around
36:43 - there so I'll let you all know about the
36:46 - difference but I just want to give you a
36:47 - heads up so that you're not you know
36:51 - surprised if I'm not on during my normal
36:53 - time all right so I want to check I want
37:03 - to check some of this stuff out so once
37:06 - again I'm assuming maybe wrongly that
37:12 - this site is using material UI so we
37:15 - inspected it before and we thought
37:17 - figured out that they weren't actually
37:18 - using it for some parts of it actually
37:28 - now that I look at the code I'm not I'm
37:32 - not sure that they're using it at all
37:39 - let me I'm just I have dev tools open on
37:44 - my other screen so if you if you want to
37:48 - check it out you can you know just open
37:52 - dev so you'll be seeing what I'm saying
37:53 - but
37:55 - [Music]
38:03 - not really sure so maybe I can't do okay
38:12 - in any case let's just grab what I'd
38:18 - like to do is actually make make
38:24 - components to do what we want him to do
38:26 - so I don't want to just throw CSS in
38:28 - there so that's what we did for the last
38:29 - project and that was okay for the last
38:31 - project because we needed to get a lot
38:33 - done in a short amount of time for this
38:35 - project there's not quite as much that
38:37 - needs to get done so we already have
38:40 - basically the site that it doesn't
38:42 - really need to change we just need to
38:43 - turn it from the jumbled mess of jQuery
38:46 - that it is into a react site but we can
38:48 - basically keep most of the Styles the
38:51 - same so we won't have to worry about
38:54 - that it's it's basically just me working
38:57 - on it this is my project the way the
38:59 - layout is right now was already approved
39:01 - by everybody that it needs to be
39:02 - approved by so I don't have to keep
39:04 - going back and forth to do revisions so
39:07 - because of all that I think that we can
39:10 - take the time now to do this in a more
39:13 - proper way and actually create
39:16 - components that will work and that we
39:18 - can reuse and bring forward in our
39:21 - future projects so that's what I'd like
39:26 - to do okay I just I just noticed here
39:31 - down at the bottom of the live chat one
39:33 - says Jesse I would suggest maybe you can
39:35 - work each feature in a branch too so get
39:38 - usage to actually that's that's a really
39:41 - good idea I think I'm gonna do that so
39:44 - yeah actually I do like I have people of
39:47 - all skill levels that watch this so I'm
39:48 - sure there's a decent number of people
39:51 - that don't use git yet or just really
39:54 - new it gets oh that's a great idea
39:58 - so we'll get used to making branches and
40:00 - merging and things that'll be that'll be
40:02 - cool I will I will do that
40:05 - Tiffany asks which course or courses are
40:08 - you taking with you dasa T hey Tiffany
40:11 - I'm pretty sure that I haven't seen you
40:13 - in live chat before so thank you thank
40:16 - or for watching and joining in I am
40:18 - taking the reacts nanodegree right now
40:22 - I've also done a lot of the front-end
40:25 - courses but just the the free versions
40:27 - so I will say this about the paid
40:29 - version the I normally go for the free
40:34 - versions of everything but in this case
40:37 - with the paid version since you get to
40:39 - keep submitting your projects and get
40:41 - feedback I'm I'm like forced to learn a
40:45 - lot more than I normally would so I
40:50 - think in it can be worth it so if you
40:54 - don't have somebody else to look at your
40:56 - code then the paid version is really
40:59 - really nice because like I said I I
41:01 - thought my app was working like for
41:05 - revisions ago like for code reviews ago
41:08 - and it wasn't so if I had just been
41:11 - doing a free verse they don't have a
41:13 - free version of the react nanodegree yet
41:15 - but if if they had one available and
41:16 - I've been doing that I would have just
41:18 - moved on and assume that my app worked
41:22 - but now I'm being forced to learn the
41:26 - right way to do it and it's not just the
41:29 - feedback that I get is not always just
41:31 - this is wrong do it right some of it is
41:33 - just suggestions like this is right but
41:35 - if you want to make it even better you
41:36 - could do it this way so that's really
41:40 - really helpful so I think I had said I
41:42 - would give you all updates on how it's
41:44 - going so that's probably so far the
41:46 - biggest takeaway that I have is that I
41:49 - had no experience with code reviews
41:51 - before and I really like them I mean
41:56 - it's frustrating when you get it back
41:58 - and you've done it wrong but I learn a
42:00 - lot from it so so anyway that's that's
42:04 - my experience thus far I'll give you an
42:05 - update something else Athens
42:16 - alright let's see I had some some
42:19 - comments about the colors here okay so
42:25 - it's Joseph says looks like the darker
42:28 - color and lighter one okay so let me
42:35 - cool Zack said I can use his color in my
42:38 - my Udacity project so awesome I'll do
42:41 - that 81 was your football number cool so
42:45 - you're a receiver that's usually your
42:48 - receiver number my number was 14
42:58 - alright so I think I'd like to grab the
43:01 - lighter color
43:11 - all right cool
43:13 - Zach says wide receiver kicker and
43:15 - ponder cool I was right wide receiver
43:17 - yeah uh once you get up into the 80s
43:19 - that's receiver yeah I was a quarterback
43:22 - and outside linebacker all right so let
43:31 - me switch actually is what I really want
43:37 - to do is I want to use the lighter color
43:38 - for everything so I don't want to change
43:40 - that active color I want to change the
43:45 - highlight color have to figure out where
43:53 - that's at where's my where's my menu
44:03 - item
44:08 - all right so I think it talks about the
44:10 - menu items at the bottom of this area
44:27 - override styles
44:40 - actually I'm not sure if I can I'm
44:44 - assuming that this is on hover so I I
44:46 - don't think I can override it here
44:48 - because that would be an inline style
44:49 - you can't do hover stuff on inline
44:51 - styles right I'm pretty sure you can't
44:55 - do it let me double check this that it
44:59 - is in fact a hover is it not
45:11 - I think I'm on the wrong
45:23 - this is interesting so let me show you
45:26 - what's going on here whoa let's do the
45:32 - holy city said alright so I'm going
45:36 - through here and trying to add the hover
45:38 - so like over here I'm just going and
45:41 - clicking hover and dev tools and none of
45:49 - these are actually making a change this
45:53 - maybe is this one
45:55 - no what else could I even put this one
46:04 - okay so everything here alright so let's
46:11 - see so it's actually so it's actually
46:18 - not a CSS hover effect which is that's
46:21 - interesting I will I just assumed it was
46:26 - so it's acts it's a let me see what
46:30 - changes
46:36 - huh
46:40 - all right so it looks like the only
46:42 - thing that's changing is just that the
46:45 - background color does change so that's
46:49 - really interesting
47:06 - all right
47:20 - so I guess we can I I really wanted to
47:24 - use like the the actual you know props
47:31 - here
47:52 - but I guess I could just put it in the
47:55 - CSS file
48:28 - it is
48:35 - all right so I guess we'll just change
48:39 - this
48:53 - actually I am gonna have to I am gonna
49:00 - figure out have to figure out how to
49:02 - change this because it's it's not
49:11 - he's actually changing the color like
49:13 - this background color seems like it's
49:16 - part of the state let's check out that
49:18 - component for a minute
49:22 - actually forget it this is a side check
49:25 - this would be something to do later on I
49:28 - don't want to get sad jacked with this
49:31 - probably just because I'm really tired
49:33 - it was easy for me to get sidetracked
49:36 - that's an unimportant thing right now
49:38 - that can go in the list of things to do
49:40 - later on I can I can live with it being
49:46 - a different color just for now and I
49:48 - could always just change it change this
49:51 - to be the same color and that'll be a
49:52 - lot easier so let's grab some of the
50:00 - material
50:01 - [Music]
50:09 - that's scarier I was hoping that the
50:12 - github would be in my my drop down there
50:15 - but it wasn't okay so let's go to
50:29 - it's a lot easier actually to go to the
50:32 - SAS and see what grid see what we need
50:53 - actually now that I think about it the
50:56 - problem had before is that it's really
50:57 - hard to just pull part of this since it
51:00 - depends on a lot of variables and other
51:04 - files so I think I will just go to the
51:06 - CSS then if you're not familiar with
51:10 - sass
51:11 - it's a whoops wrong spot if you're not
51:14 - familiar with sass oops
51:24 - it is a CSS preprocessor so you can do
51:29 - more than you can do with normal CSS you
51:31 - can have like variables and some logic
51:33 - in there and you can combine like
51:37 - separate files together and so it's
51:39 - really cool but I wanted I want to see
51:44 - this file this the CSS is what gets
51:47 - produced when you you know compile it
51:52 - all to normal CSS so what I'm gonna do
51:57 - is I know call us the column is what I
52:06 - want
52:07 - I never eyes there's so many thing with
52:12 - call in it oh my goodness there we go
52:20 - that's to search for a row so I want
52:25 - these container classes and everything
52:29 - and actually before I do this let me
52:39 - I just want to check
52:52 - I want to check I don't really know that
52:54 - much about licenses so I want to make
53:02 - sure that I give attribution properly or
53:07 - if I'm even allowed to pull out part of
53:10 - this okay its MIT license I know enough
53:17 - to know the MIT license is pretty pretty
53:24 - open let me see if they actually have a
53:30 - license there you go
53:52 - okay so basically it seems like I can do
53:55 - whatever I want and use this as long as
53:58 - I keep this
54:01 - this license with it which I don't
54:06 - really see any reason why I couldn't
54:07 - have an MIT license on my project as
54:10 - well if anyone had knows of any good
54:12 - reasons why I shouldn't then let me know
54:14 - now but that's not really a big deal I
54:20 - don't really care if anybody uses any of
54:23 - my stuff okay cool so let's let's do
54:30 - that then
54:31 - let's put a license on our project and
54:35 - then we'll grab this and we should be
54:37 - good and let me know if someone knows
54:40 - more about licenses and I'm making a
54:43 - mistake here let me know please in the
54:45 - live chat
54:51 - obviously Sebastian said might be using
54:54 - jsm else over to change background color
54:56 - yeah that's what I think I think it's
54:58 - probably using that that's what I was
54:59 - gonna look at the component to see
55:01 - before I realized that that was just
55:04 - kind of a waste of time
55:06 - because I had better things to do all
55:09 - right so let's I want to do this license
55:11 - thing first because otherwise I'll
55:13 - probably just put it off and never do it
55:15 - and I think it'd be cool to show you all
55:17 - how to do this so there's a really easy
55:21 - way to do a license within github so I
55:23 - mean obviously we could just copy and
55:25 - paste that which would be really easy
55:26 - but I'd like to show you this in case
55:29 - you want to use a different license
55:31 - where's my site Resource Center right
55:34 - yeah okay so if we go in here and go to
55:39 - create new file and then type in
55:49 - :
55:54 - he's got a I see yet no I can't i spell
56:00 - license hey I seriously spelled license
56:05 - correctly last night license right no
56:20 - with all right somebody help me out what
56:24 - is wrong with me li si en se right right
56:31 - yeah all right what's supposed to happen
56:36 - maybe I have to put in caps
56:46 - what's supposed to happen is that
56:49 - there's something supposed to come up on
56:51 - this side that'll let you just pick a
56:53 - license why this has worked last night
56:58 - for me my eyes are not working right now
57:15 - dear refresh this page
57:27 - there we go okay this is what's supposed
57:30 - to happen if you manage site license
57:32 - correctly the first time you can choose
57:37 - a license template right so you click
57:40 - this and you can go in here and pick a
57:43 - license and it'll tell you all kinds of
57:46 - things about that license so you can go
57:48 - through and pick which one you need so
57:52 - that's what I really wanted to show you
57:54 - because this is pretty cool if you're
57:55 - not sure about it you can go to learn
57:58 - more but this can help you if if you're
58:01 - not exactly sure about your license so
58:03 - I'm gonna pick the MIT license see it
58:05 - already fills in everything for me it
58:08 - even fills in the year and the name in
58:13 - this case it's the name of the
58:14 - organization otherwise like on my on my
58:18 - own github it puts in my name so you
58:26 - know I should I want to see full name of
58:31 - copyright owner I'm gonna put my name
58:43 - because so technically when I started
58:47 - working here I signed no contract so I
58:50 - pretty much control the code that I
58:53 - write so that there's nothing there's
58:56 - nothing that says that my code like that
58:59 - I can't use elsewhere so I'm gonna
59:01 - interpret that as I can use it however I
59:05 - want and other projects and so let's go
59:11 - to review and submit so you can check it
59:13 - out here it is and we have a license
59:15 - file and I wanted that's V dot MD cool
59:30 - awesome and then right from here we can
59:35 - we can if we wanted to create a new
59:38 - branch for this commit and then start a
59:39 - pull request actually let's do that
59:43 - since like one said it would be cool to
59:46 - get more practice with git so let's
59:48 - start a new branch for a pull request
59:50 - and then we'll merge this request in and
59:53 - since I already know what's happening
59:55 - here like will do it through the github
59:57 - interface and then in the future we'll
59:59 - do them through the command line
60:06 - cool so now we're gonna open a pull
60:08 - request create license I don't think I
60:12 - really need to write anything that's we
60:15 - know what that means and you can see it
60:18 - shows the changes we've created a new
60:20 - file so really easy to tell what's going
60:23 - on and let's create the pull request now
60:29 - I can see this pull request this pull
60:31 - request number seven and let's merge it
60:39 - and there's they're actually options so
60:43 - we can merge the pull request and
60:49 - there'll be a merge commit and so this
60:54 - just says exactly what's happening and
60:58 - I'm gonna confirm the merge and then now
61:03 - if we go back to our local machine we
61:07 - can run a get pool and we have our
61:13 - license
61:19 - all right so cool successful thing
61:22 - number two that we've done today all
61:26 - right so now I saw something Sebastian
61:28 - said material.you I actually does have a
61:31 - grid system so Sebastian material oh I
61:40 - just want to let you all know the the
61:42 - live the live stream from Instagram has
61:47 - ended so that oh that has a one hour
61:49 - time limit so if you want to check it
61:53 - out the videos available for 24 hours
61:56 - after I recorded so Sebastian if there
62:02 - is a great system I know I couldn't find
62:05 - one before I found one with the beta
62:07 - version but I couldn't find a grid
62:09 - system with the old version so am I just
62:12 - am I missing something or is it just
62:14 - with the beta also Sebastian found out
62:20 - how to edit that that color add this to
62:24 - the list item hover color Alexander says
62:32 - hey from Russia love your coding
62:33 - sessions Jessie thanks and thanks for
62:36 - watching I really appreciate it okay
62:44 - Sebastian is saying grid list
62:45 - I checked out grid list a few days ago
62:48 - and I it wasn't what I wanted I mean
62:55 - maybe it would get the job done but it
62:57 - was not what I really had in mind with
63:00 - with the grid system let's see what was
63:06 - I gonna I was gonna change the
63:12 - the hover color
63:36 - so I'm assuming that on here I can
63:39 - change the hover color Wow
63:50 - I don't think that you saw that but if
63:54 - you you ever had your hands like one key
63:56 - off I just I had them one key off and
64:01 - then it just messes up everything
64:18 - yes like I guess see Joseph said as well
64:20 - I could put it in a theme but I'm not
64:23 - really gonna use these the same way
64:25 - anywhere else so I think I'll just do it
64:27 - like this for now assuming that this
64:29 - will work and what was the color we were
64:31 - using let's see if that works
64:43 - not yet No
64:54 - okay so Joseph said menu item won't work
64:57 - because it doesn't pass the prop okay so
65:01 - I will need to then put this in our
65:13 - theme are we even using a theme yeah we
65:21 - made this right this is a few esteem
65:38 - okay Sebastian said added to the list
65:40 - item not the menu item
66:05 - actually I'm not
66:17 - yeah okay Joseph that's what I was just
66:19 - thinking I can't put it on the list item
66:22 - because it's generated by menu items so
66:26 - anyway I'm just I'll figure that out at
66:29 - a different time I really want to move
66:31 - over this this code from materialized to
66:36 - where did I have okay so let's try to
66:45 - grab everything we need should basically
66:49 - all the column classes and it'll
66:55 - probably be obvious pretty early on
66:58 - whether or not they're conflicts as far
67:02 - as the class names go
67:04 - if that happens we'll figure out what to
67:07 - do but maybe it won't happen okay
67:24 - oh that's cool they actually have an
67:26 - Excel class built-in I remember for a
67:28 - project I made my own Excel classes you
67:31 - used to have it was just small medium
67:34 - and large so I should have submitted a
67:38 - pull request for that I could have got
67:39 - this in oh well I just didn't have time
67:45 - at the time to really clean it up and
67:47 - submit so all right so now we have all
67:50 - that let's let's pull in
68:05 - all right so would it make I think it
68:09 - would make sense to have a Styles folder
68:11 - so let's do that so from the command
68:16 - line we can create folders by doing make
68:21 - directory and we can do so you want this
68:25 - to be within source and let's call it
68:30 - styles so now we have that directory and
68:34 - now we want to create a new file so
68:37 - we're going to use the command touch
68:39 - source styles and we'll call this
68:49 - materialize grid and that's a CSS file
68:58 - okay so now we have the Styles folder
69:03 - and we have this materialize grid and
69:05 - then we can put all of our grid styles
69:08 - in here all right so everything's in
69:10 - here and we'll save that and then we can
69:13 - pull that in oops I meant meant to get
69:20 - the app j/s so we can pull that in here
69:22 - in our app das and importer here and
69:25 - then it'll be available for us to use
69:26 - for for all of our stuff so if we could
69:33 - see here we already have an import of a
69:36 - CSS file so let's just copy that and
69:38 - then import the column classes here and
69:44 - so what we want is to go into the Styles
69:50 - folder and then
70:04 - materialise grid okay let's check it out
70:11 - all right so so far nothing weird has
70:17 - happened now we should be able to use
70:21 - the materialized classes so let's go
70:24 - into our home view I'll switch it back
70:27 - up let's go into our home view and try
70:28 - to try to use some of them I just
70:35 - remembered I forgot to use my Pomodoro
70:37 - clock again this is two days in a row so
70:43 - I don't think I'm gonna use it now it's
70:47 - in something this far in whereas okay we
70:52 - have views and home
70:55 - okay so within our home view I want this
71:02 - all to the inside of a container
71:15 - and then within that container we're
71:19 - gonna have a a row and then within the
71:30 - row of columns and we'll do s 12 medium
71:47 - 4 and that should give us our 3
72:05 - okay and actually we don't need that
72:14 - anymore we have two missing one Dave
72:24 - okay so we have this and let's just put
72:38 - depending on what the fonts doing with
72:41 - material you I may we may want to bring
72:42 - in that that flow text responsive font
72:47 - class from materialized as well because
72:50 - I kind of like that and it would match a
72:54 - lot of what we're doing with other sites
72:55 - so let's just make loose nice one three
73:14 - okay
73:17 - and save it and see what we have
73:37 - what did I do
73:48 - all right so obviously I didn't really
73:54 - have an error in index so where's my ear
74:01 - probably in home since that's the only
74:03 - thing we change let me see what have I
74:06 - done
74:37 - there we go
74:40 - 9:7 no i'm jazz
75:09 - all right good call Alexander thank you
75:13 - and who else
75:15 - tor tor yeah yeah says try return
75:18 - awesome
75:19 - so all right cool check that out so we
75:26 - have our common classes and see if this
75:28 - works when we go small yes great this
75:37 - don't actually look centered though
75:39 - what's going on let me move this over so
75:44 - we can see this okay I see why it
75:50 - doesn't look centered because these are
75:52 - just right aligned so that's fine so
75:54 - this is actually the only one so this is
75:56 - our container which is full width with
75:59 - margins and the margins actually get
76:03 - smaller their bet percentage based but
76:07 - even the percentages themselves change
76:09 - there with the media queries so that's
76:10 - cool on small screens the margins are
76:13 - really small which is what we want this
76:16 - is our row this is our columns these are
76:21 - columns cool
76:23 - so that is working as we want let's
76:25 - throw some cards in here but let's use
76:27 - the material UI cards and then that'll
76:32 - be a kind of even better test of
76:34 - conflicts when we start intermixing more
76:39 - of the components from material UI you
76:44 - see I don't really like that font wait
76:57 - it's a 400 wait I think I like 300 yeah
77:00 - I like 300 better anyway I'll change
77:06 - that later I don't wanna get that
77:08 - checked
77:09 - alright let's throw in some cards so
77:12 - let's go back to our material UI
77:16 - documentation here and let's look up the
77:21 - cards let's make this a bit bigger so
77:30 - you want a card and we just want just
77:36 - wanted a really plain card let's see
77:45 - it joins the most plain none of it they
77:50 - don't you know have just a regular
77:52 - playing card alright so I just have to
77:54 - grab this and then take stuff out
78:04 - let's grab this card
78:13 - and probably I'll take out almost all of
78:16 - that stuff so I don't want the actions
78:25 - take out the card actions and don't want
78:30 - a title yeah I think I might want the
78:36 - title right now I think do I have
78:39 - explanatory text I do I think I have a
78:41 - title text and then instead of an image
78:44 - I have an icon so let's leave the card
78:50 - media maybe not I don't think I don't
78:57 - know I think I want to leave the card
78:58 - media how does this look
79:05 - yeah I don't really want it to appear
79:07 - like a separate section so let's take
79:11 - this out for now it'll just make it
79:14 - easier and I don't want the header okay
79:18 - so now we have a much more basic card
79:22 - which should be good for for our
79:24 - purposes
79:33 - let's pop these cards in here and then
79:37 - we need to import some things so let's
79:42 - import all this stuff and we can get rid
79:46 - of the stuff or not using once we pull
79:48 - it in so we don't need the card actions
79:53 - the card header or the card media
80:03 - okay save that see how it looks cool all
80:11 - right so we have these cards okay not
80:21 - bad they need definitely we need to work
80:24 - on our padding so in in materialize the
80:33 - cards themselves have the right padding
80:35 - so it usually doesn't happen like this
80:37 - so we'll have to just see if I mean
80:41 - maybe we want them to be closer together
80:43 - I don't I don't think that doesn't look
80:47 - I think I'd like to have a little bit
80:49 - more padding so other than some you know
80:52 - padding issues this is what we want I
81:00 - mean obviously we wanted to come down a
81:02 - bit
81:04 - we'll probably vertically align so we
81:07 - might actually grab the vertical
81:10 - alignment classes as well from
81:13 - materialise yeah
81:23 - now what we can do so basically we've
81:25 - put in the CSS and we've tested it and
81:28 - it pretty much does what we want it to
81:30 - do what we could do and what we may end
81:34 - up doing is making components where we
81:42 - could you know have a component that
81:44 - would let's say be column and then you
81:47 - would pass it you know what you wanted
81:51 - it to be and then that would end up
81:52 - being these things you know but it would
81:57 - be in the form of a component and we
82:01 - could do the same thing with row and
82:05 - container if we wanted to I'm not sure I
82:08 - don't know if it would be better to make
82:10 - these all components or if it would be
82:13 - better to leave someone like this I kind
82:17 - of if I had to say I would say the
82:20 - column is a much better candidate to be
82:23 - its own component than the row in the
82:25 - container just because you know the
82:30 - columns I mean it can change a lot they
82:34 - would be decent to be able you know pass
82:38 - props in and change what you want him to
82:43 - to have it would also be cool you know
82:46 - to change these based on you know a
82:49 - change in state so you could switch up
82:53 - your column so it would then be pretty
82:56 - easy to do something like I don't know
82:59 - have a toggle to say you can toggle
83:02 - between like a grid layout and a
83:04 - full-width layout you know just by
83:06 - clicking the button and then all the
83:07 - button would do would just just do a set
83:11 - state so that would be cool I the only
83:15 - place where that might be useful is
83:18 - maybe where we do the we're gonna do the
83:22 - image gallery for the logos otherwise I
83:25 - don't really think we need to use
83:27 - something like that so I mean currently
83:30 - we don't have that functionality so we
83:33 - don't really have to add it in
83:36 - okay I'm gonna go to the live chat well
83:40 - first let me let me copy this because
83:45 - basically this is going to be our layout
83:49 - so we're just going to do this twice
84:02 - cool
84:08 - and I'd like to see
84:21 - Wow there's a lot of things you can do
84:23 - with cards cool
84:34 - okay cool one thing I definitely want to
84:36 - do with these cards is make sure that
84:38 - they always stay the same height so
84:44 - we'll see how I want to do that I've
84:49 - done it before with some flexbox stuff
84:52 - which doesn't work it doesn't work well
84:57 - with the way everything was done in
84:59 - materialised but it might work better
85:01 - with this I'm not sure I'll have to look
85:05 - at the the markup that's created from
85:07 - the card component or we can do it by a
85:11 - bunch of media queries setting min
85:14 - heights which I'd rather not do it that
85:16 - way all right so I'm gonna check the
85:25 - live chat really quickly before I commit
85:28 - this in case there's something I should
85:30 - I should do differently and then after
85:37 - that if this is all good I'll commit
85:39 - this push it up to github and then I'll
85:41 - be taking some questions so if you were
85:44 - just here for the code probably not
85:47 - gonna be too much code left so thanks
85:51 - for watching if you want to I'm gonna
85:53 - quit watching now that's cool otherwise
85:58 - if you have questions put them in the
85:59 - live chat now worried if you can't stick
86:02 - around you can put them in the comments
86:05 - below or direct message me on Twitter
86:17 - hey Jeremy how's it going so Jeremy has
86:20 - joined us in the lab chat thanks for
86:23 - joining us okay looks like there's no
86:32 - messages related to these cards but but
86:37 - actually it looks so much better with
86:38 - content there I don't know about you but
86:41 - I mean it I mean obviously like this
86:43 - there needs to be space right there that
86:45 - looks terrible but actually having
86:49 - something here makes it look a lot
86:50 - better I can't that's one weight really
86:53 - bothers me I'm definitely gonna change
86:55 - that soon all right so let's oh ed we
87:00 - were gonna make different branches for
87:02 - each thing that we're doing right so
87:07 - let's see I think for now since with the
87:15 - end I'm just gonna commit this but then
87:17 - I'm gonna try to think out when I make
87:22 - my Trello cards I'm gonna try to make it
87:24 - a point to make each task in my Trello
87:27 - card a separate branch and then that'll
87:31 - be cool so we'll know when we move it to
87:32 - done at that point we will merge the
87:34 - branch and then we can keep track of
87:38 - things like that we can also I think
87:42 - there's a plug-in or an add-on in in
87:44 - Trello to where you can attach github
87:47 - issues or pull requests to a Trello card
87:51 - so we'll try that out - that seems seems
87:55 - like it would be kind of cool - to do so
87:57 - anyway for now I'm just gonna do a
87:59 - straight commit to the master branch
88:03 - also I had some advice from someone in
88:07 - the comments for YouTube saying that
88:10 - they usually have a dev branch they do
88:14 - everything on the dev branch and they
88:17 - they leave the master branch basically
88:19 - at a really basic level and only
88:22 - it's like periodically to the master
88:26 - branch so I'm kind of thinking about
88:29 - doing that so let me know what you think
88:32 - about that I think I was understanding
88:34 - what he was saying correctly I was
88:36 - actually gonna try to do it for this
88:37 - stream but I totally forgot just because
88:41 - of everything else that happened today
88:42 - all right so we're gonna commit and well
88:45 - first let's go status just to see what
88:48 - we changed okay cool so we can't do a
88:52 - regular git commit with the am flag
88:55 - because it won't add this okay so we
88:58 - actually need to add this so we could
89:01 - add it by name but since we're gonna add
89:03 - all this anyway at the same time let's
89:08 - um let's do get and then we can put a
89:15 - period and it'll add everything so now
89:18 - if we do get status we can see
89:20 - everything's ready now we can do a git
89:22 - commit and this time we don't need to
89:24 - add because we've already added we can
89:25 - just do the M for the message and we'll
89:27 - say
89:28 - [Music]
89:38 - call them classes actually it's more
89:41 - than just the column stuff - would you
89:47 - really call it a greater is it a column
89:49 - system I don't know I'm not really that
89:52 - worried about it because I think we all
89:54 - kind of know what we're talking about
89:56 - when we say grid system page layout okay
90:11 - what do you mess up 300k we defined I
90:21 - forgot to get rid of this so that I
90:27 - think those were the buttons that were
90:29 - used in the action items in the card and
90:31 - we remove that section but we never
90:32 - remove that button so cool so now let's
90:39 - just so that commit actually never went
90:41 - through right it stopped it before that
90:43 - was committed so we can just press the
90:45 - UP button on our keyboard and it'll
90:47 - bring up that same thing and we can just
90:49 - hit enter again and run it again it
90:51 - should work this time assuming we didn't
90:52 - make any other mistakes and it did now
90:56 - we can do a git push and all right now
91:03 - it's on github okay so now we're good
91:07 - and doesn't matter what happens to our
91:09 - computer everything is on github and now
91:13 - I'm gonna check out the live chat so let
91:17 - me scroll up a bit and let's see I want
91:25 - to try to get everybody's questions if I
91:27 - happen to not get to your question just
91:30 - send me you know send me a message and
91:32 - I'll try to get to it and I know some of
91:34 - you have sent me stuff so either in the
91:36 - comments or on Twitter and I've tried to
91:41 - at least get back to everybody with with
91:44 - something even if it's like hey I'll
91:45 - check this out later so I just I've been
91:48 - really busy lately between my class and
91:51 - and work and everybody's birthdays this
91:55 - past weekend so I haven't forgotten
91:59 - about you I'll try to get to it when I
92:02 - can
92:03 - oh now I'm gonna be even more busy with
92:05 - my my client site like Christ database
92:09 - crashing but on to my best okay so open
92:17 - comment says anyone working on Drupal 8
92:21 - actually no I'm not working on anything
92:23 - with Drupal 8 now I did briefly try it
92:28 - out but now I applied to speak at a
92:32 - drupal conference and talk about how you
92:34 - can use the drupal api with reacts but i
92:39 - didn't hear back from them so i don't
92:41 - know when they closed that but I didn't
92:43 - get anything so guessing I'm not gonna
92:46 - get into that conference so if I did get
92:50 - accepted then I was gonna look up more
92:52 - about Drupal but basically it's very
92:55 - similar to using the WordPress API so
92:57 - that's why I I applied to speak there
93:05 - Fred says hi I need a job Fred if you're
93:13 - if you're looking for a job if you um if
93:18 - you send me a tweet so like if if you're
93:24 - on Twitter put in a tweet like what kind
93:28 - of job you want and what your
93:29 - qualifications are and then tag me in it
93:31 - and then I'll retweet it and I don't
93:36 - have a lot of followers but most of the
93:40 - people that follow me are in you know
93:43 - the tech industry so they might know
93:46 - someone or know something so otherwise I
93:50 - can't really help you about getting a
93:52 - job not really in a position to give out
93:55 - hubs at this point but if any of you
93:58 - watching are get in touch with Fred
94:03 - Abdi says hi hey how's it going
94:19 - Nathaniel says I had to leave early
94:21 - yesterday can you let me know what I
94:22 - missed I don't think we did I think we
94:24 - spent most of the second half of the
94:26 - stream just going over questions so I
94:28 - don't think I actually coded anything
94:38 - okay I see a patrick said I wrote
94:40 - everything back yeah that's that's true
94:42 - I did I couldn't get it couldn't get the
94:47 - beta to work
95:11 - okay when when I was talking about my
95:14 - github branch and I was glad that I
95:16 - didn't have Arizona toin said I don't
95:18 - think it's bad to push a branch with
95:20 - errors to get hub as long as it is not
95:23 - master might be fun yeah I can kind of
95:26 - see that especially if you needed help
95:30 - with those errors and you're working on
95:31 - a team of course you would want to push
95:33 - it so that they could help so yeah I
95:36 - guess that's not really a big deal now
95:39 - that I think about it so yeah thanks for
95:44 - that that kind of made me think about it
95:46 - differently
95:58 - Blake said I'm loving these livestreams
96:01 - awesome I'm glad you're loving this
96:03 - dreams thanks for watching and
96:05 - participating in the live chat fred ass
96:10 - Hades Python in your projects I've never
96:13 - used Python in a project for a client I
96:17 - I took the intro to computer science
96:23 - course from Udacity and they use Python
96:26 - in that course so I did some Python with
96:28 - that but honestly I didn't even finish
96:30 - the course so I didn't do anything
96:32 - really advanced with Python but I kind
96:35 - of like Python it was really easy to
96:37 - work with it was cool like a lot of it
96:40 - was the syntax was kind of easy to write
96:56 - Daniel says I thank you for the live
96:59 - you're welcome
97:00 - thanks for watching and joining in live
97:03 - chat
97:10 - okay Sebastian says there's no need to
97:13 - add a general theme when using material
97:16 - UI if I only want to just apply
97:19 - something to a component because if I
97:23 - added theme to the root I'd have to add
97:27 - all the different customizations to the
97:29 - theme file and I'm assuming that's for
97:33 - the beta because obviously where we are
97:35 - using a theme file right now for this
97:38 - version so but that's good to know if I
97:40 - use the beta later on if any of you are
97:42 - planning on using the beta not really a
97:46 - need to do global theme if you really
97:52 - don't need to
98:17 - okay about halfway through the live chat
98:20 - now
98:28 - okay so he had some some of you
98:34 - recommending some themes so skeleton
98:44 - theme Patrick says get skeleton calm
98:46 - I've heard about that theme I have not
98:49 - used it and then harsh it says semantic
98:57 - UI is also great and it has react
98:59 - bindings to cool open comments ass is
99:06 - there react project one day one video
99:09 - looks like this is react project - and
99:12 - how many days - project one go to many
99:16 - days project one went so I for this
99:20 - project I started doing like the days
99:22 - because I think that'll be easier for
99:25 - people who want to watch later on and
99:27 - it's easier for me so for the first
99:29 - project I was trying to describe in the
99:32 - title of the video what I was going to
99:34 - do now I'm just gonna put that in the
99:36 - description and not the title the title
99:39 - is just gonna say what day it is and
99:42 - what project it is if maybe if I can fit
99:46 - some little descriptive thing in there I
99:48 - will but I think that'll be a little bit
99:50 - more helpful to keep track of everything
99:52 - because this playlist is going to end up
99:54 - being huge and have lots of different
99:57 - projects so I think it'll be better like
99:59 - this so if you want to go back to
100:01 - project one day one you have to actually
100:03 - go to my youtube channel and the links
100:07 - in the description for this video and
100:09 - find the video that's called building a
100:12 - website as fast as I can
100:14 - and if you start with that one and watch
100:17 - there I think there's maybe two or three
100:19 - of those on my channel and then I
100:21 - started streaming for free code camp and
100:25 - the rest of them are all in the live
100:27 - coding with Jesse playlist all in order
100:30 - there so it's a little bit confusing for
100:36 - that but hopefully it'll be a much
100:39 - easier
100:40 - system of naming from here on out
100:53 - I see Patrick pretty much said what I
100:56 - just said thanks pastor
101:16 - Sebastien says I have some issues with
101:18 - my PC for some reason opening tabs on
101:20 - Chrome and Firefox slows down my PC
101:23 - video and audio are d synced over time
101:27 - in YouTube don't know what to do
101:30 - might have to reinstall windows 10 to
101:32 - see what's causing the issue happens to
101:34 - a friend too but worse sarah says have
101:39 - you tried reinstalling Chrome or Firefox
101:41 - sebastian installed firefox only to see
101:44 - if it happens
101:55 - yeah that's uh I had that happen on my
101:58 - PC but it was a long time ago I don't
102:02 - know if I ever really found a solution
102:04 - for that either so I'm not really sure
102:07 - what was causing it I remember looking
102:08 - it up but I don't it's been years ago so
102:12 - I don't really remember what I found out
102:14 - sorry I can't help you more if I wanted
102:23 - to be a jerk I would just say like buy a
102:25 - Mac but I'm not I'm not gonna say this
102:37 - I'm not like a Mac only guy either I
102:40 - have pcs and a Chromebook and Linux
102:45 - servers so they all have their their
102:50 - pros and cons Sebastian says controversy
102:56 - that's not football okay yeah so for for
102:59 - all the non American people and I guess
103:02 - Canadian because they have football - or
103:04 - at least american-style football when we
103:07 - were talking about football we did not
103:08 - mean what everyone else calls football
103:11 - that we call soccer so I should say that
103:16 - Zach and I played American football
103:20 - that's what they call it right in the
103:22 - rest of the world I'm pretty sure sorry
103:24 - I've never been out of the United States
103:26 - my knowledge of everywhere else is all
103:29 - secondhand so yes we I did not play
103:35 - soccer so when I was growing up the
103:37 - soccer wasn't really a thing where I was
103:40 - at
103:40 - so I played American football sorry if I
103:47 - offended anyone in Europe or or
103:50 - elsewhere pretty much the rest of the
103:52 - world is like called soccer football I
103:54 - think
104:11 - Oh Emmanuelle said that that son this
104:15 - was a while ago sorry I didn't see this
104:17 - in respond to it
104:18 - Manuel says the codes are blurry so yeah
104:23 - sorry about that
104:24 - maybe in terms of my connection it was
104:28 - it was really good it was over five
104:30 - thousand kilobits per second the whole
104:31 - time so it should be okay it's possible
104:35 - that somewhere between you and I the
104:38 - connection is slowing down or as Sarah
104:42 - mentions you could try changing the
104:45 - video settings sometimes that happens to
104:49 - me although I try to set it to auto or I
104:53 - try to set it to be HD all the time it
104:55 - always reverts to auto on YouTube and so
104:58 - even when I know I have a good
105:00 - connection sometimes it'll start me out
105:02 - at a really low quality and I have to
105:05 - manually change it although sometimes it
105:08 - corrects itself oh one says that you
105:14 - there's choose a license com
105:16 - so I showed how to do the license
105:18 - through github but if you would like to
105:21 - see a different place where you can get
105:24 - information on licenses you can use
105:25 - choose a license com I've never been
105:28 - there so that's not an official
105:29 - endorsement I'm just saying what once it
105:33 - MFC 88 thank you for spelling out
105:36 - license properly for me I think I've
105:39 - said this before but it's crazy how much
105:42 - I misspelled when I'm live-streaming and
105:48 - I normally can spell it fine I mean I'm
105:52 - not gonna say I'm a great speller
105:53 - obviously like autocorrect is ruined me
105:55 - and I don't even bother spelling things
105:57 - properly anymore but I normally can type
106:03 - and spell pretty well but not whenever
106:07 - I'm loud
106:19 - okay David said you can do the same
106:22 - thing alright in terms of adding the the
106:24 - license by going into the insights tab
106:29 - actually I don't think I've ever done
106:31 - that let's check it out
106:38 - inside where can I
106:53 - okay cool so from the insights tab you
106:58 - can add alright so we do ever readme we
107:00 - have a license we have no code of
107:02 - conduct or guidelines for contributing
107:04 - so maybe we should add these in a future
107:06 - stream that would be cool to have this
107:09 - kind of properly built out especially
107:11 - since we we are getting contributions so
107:15 - yeah maybe we'll do that thanks for that
107:17 - I never realized you could you could
107:19 - click that and one says there's also an
107:21 - option to choose a license when you
107:22 - create the project and github so I
107:24 - usually just skip that because I'm
107:26 - always like when I start a project I'm
107:29 - either not sure what its gonna be for
107:30 - sure or I'm in a hurry and but that
107:34 - would probably be a better thing to do
107:35 - and just be pick the license right off
107:37 - the bat and not worry about it
107:51 - Jordan said what would I miss and that
107:55 - was like at least a half an hour ago so
107:58 - sorry for not answering then basically
108:03 - we were just kind of changing the title
108:06 - and the color of the active page in the
108:12 - side nav we added a license we copied
108:15 - over some styles from materialized and
108:19 - then I think at that point you're
108:21 - already here so you saw the rest of it
108:22 - so didn't miss much I went over pool
108:26 - request to Marvin said that indentation
108:35 - gave me cancer was it when I think when
108:42 - I was working on this the indentation
108:44 - was really crazy so I don't worry about
108:49 - it anymore because I know it's all gonna
108:51 - get fixed every time I commit but yeah
108:54 - sometimes it just looked crazy
109:01 - that's what's a what's a good CSS
109:04 - framework besides bootstrap Blake says
109:06 - get skeleton comm wants his foundation
109:10 - [Music]
109:13 - also skeleton evidently does not have a
109:16 - CDN
109:23 - I I liked materialised as an alternative
109:29 - to bootstrap but if you're going to use
109:32 - react you may not want to go with
109:35 - materialized because a lot of stuffs
109:36 - done through jQuery and you don't really
109:38 - want to manipulate the Dom with jQuery
109:41 - if you're using react
109:56 - okay so it looks like some people use
109:59 - foundation as a framework also Joseph
110:05 - says I'm trying out semantic UI and my
110:08 - next project
110:17 - okay AdMob and says branches this is
110:21 - we're talking about doing separate
110:22 - branches branches only really makes
110:24 - sense if you have to work on different
110:25 - things parallely is that it's Eduard
110:30 - Parri lovely I probably would have said
110:35 - in parallel now I'm probably gonna have
110:39 - to look that up I want to know if that's
110:41 - a word and if so I'll start using it
110:46 - Alexander says Jessie what kara so would
110:48 - you recommend to use with react to Jas I
110:54 - don't think I've used so I have used the
110:57 - materialized carousel with react Jas but
111:00 - I wouldn't recommend doing that because
111:02 - as I said you don't usually want to
111:04 - manipulate the Dom so I'm not sure did I
111:12 - use I wonder now I wonder if there's
111:16 - some sort of carousel that comes with
111:18 - this it doesn't look like it okay yeah I
111:25 - have no recommendations for react
111:27 - carousels because I've I've not used one
111:30 - the proper way at least with with react
111:32 - so sorry about that if anyone else is
111:35 - used to carousel with react that's
111:37 - actually a react component and does
111:38 - things the proper way then please put it
111:43 - in the live chat
111:50 - okay one says I like the master and dead
111:52 - branches scheme you can use tags for
111:54 - releases - okay cool
111:56 - oh I'll try my best to remember that and
111:59 - and actually get that going for for the
112:03 - live stream tomorrow Blake asks what do
112:06 - you guys think about Jekyll Alexander
112:08 - thinks Jekyll is awesome
112:12 - Blake says I'm still a noob so should I
112:14 - wait and see how it works and everything
112:19 - yeah I have not used Jekyll before but
112:23 - I've seen videos on it and I think it
112:26 - looks really interesting and cool so
112:29 - Alexander says I'm still a new - you can
112:33 - check dev tips channel here on YouTube
112:35 - and see how Jekyll works yeah actually I
112:37 - think I think I've watched the dev tips
112:39 - videos on Jekyll so I like the dev tips
112:43 - channel
112:44 - I think it's Travis does the videos I
112:47 - think he does a really good job and you
112:53 - learn a lot and they're fun to watch too
112:54 - so yeah check that out to learn more
112:57 - about Jekyll 1 says I work with Drupal 8
113:03 - right now ok cool so I think we were I'd
113:05 - gone back and someone asked about Drupal
113:06 - 8 so once it's working with your boy
113:08 - that's cool we have I'm only if I use a
113:13 - CMS I normally use WordPress but we do
113:15 - have some things built some sites that I
113:19 - don't work on directly but we have some
113:23 - sites you at the University they're a
113:24 - bit with Drupal I've worked with it a
113:27 - little bit in the past
113:30 - yosef says I just wonder how much you
113:34 - get paid for a monthly basis I don't
113:43 - let's see I was about to show you my
113:46 - timesheet on on air but then I thought
113:49 - about it and I I thought I better not
113:52 - just in case like there's some personal
113:55 - information like uh I don't know what's
113:58 - on that screen maybe as my social
113:59 - security number and everything so I'm
114:00 - gonna do it on my other screen now
114:02 - because I don't remember what I make in
114:06 - a month but I will tell you in a few
114:09 - seconds so I'm actually a big proponent
114:18 - of not keeping salary information secret
114:22 - so I think normally that works against
114:25 - employees and it benefits the employers
114:28 - more so I think we would all be better
114:32 - off if salary information were pretty
114:34 - available the only time that it could
114:36 - potentially hurt employees if you're
114:37 - going to get a new job and your
114:40 - employers realize that you don't make
114:41 - that much and so they think they can get
114:43 - away with offering you less other than
114:46 - that situation I think normally it's
114:48 - better so let me go to my on my other
114:53 - screen I'm going to find the information
114:55 - and then I'll let you know
115:03 - all right so every month after they take
115:07 - taxes out and insurance and all that
115:10 - other stuff that get taken out of my
115:12 - paycheck I make about twenty five
115:15 - hundred dollars so I'm not sure if
115:23 - that's a lot or not a lot in my the my
115:27 - area of the United States is pretty
115:31 - economically depressed so that's that's
115:35 - enough for me to pay all my bills and
115:37 - support my wife and four children but in
115:41 - a lot of areas like in big cities that
115:43 - would that would be nothing that that
115:45 - might not even cover rent
115:57 - one says I push to github even if it has
115:59 - errors just in case you never know maybe
116:01 - your laptop burns yeah that is that's
116:02 - another good point Yosef says I really
116:07 - love your live coding because it keeps
116:09 - you motivated well awesome I really
116:11 - appreciate when you all another there
116:13 - have been some other really positive
116:15 - comments today in the live chat I really
116:18 - do appreciate that so I don't get tired
116:23 - of hearing that said because I mean
116:28 - honestly like with the streams I there
116:30 - are good days and bad days there days
116:31 - when things get really well and then
116:33 - there are days when I feel like I've
116:35 - done nothing right so the positive
116:37 - feedback helps me to want to keep going
116:38 - it so I actually really do look forward
116:41 - to the streams right now and everybody's
116:44 - been like 99% of every comment I've
116:46 - gotten has been positive so I don't
116:50 - intend to stop doing these streams
116:51 - anytime soon unless something beyond my
116:54 - control happens and I have to suck Oh a
117:00 - patrick says pure CSS looks good if you
117:03 - want to include just the functionality
117:05 - you need okay that's cool
117:15 - let's see lei Tuan on I'm I'm not he's
117:19 - actually I pronounced that I'm sorry so
117:20 - as you can try to use styled component
117:23 - cool
117:24 - yeah actually I'm Patrick says I did so
117:26 - I did use the styled components in my
117:28 - last project so I actually I liked it I
117:32 - think that's really useful one says yeah
117:35 - we do we call it American football in
117:37 - Spanish okay cool that's what I thought
117:39 - thought it was American football I
117:45 - wonder how it came to be that we called
117:47 - two different sports the same thing I
117:51 - don't I don't understand I don't know
117:54 - the history of how that happened
118:06 - okay Joseph I see just have put in some
118:09 - some CSS to change the active div so
118:15 - cool Thank You J Rex asks what
118:21 - programming language did you use
118:23 - back-end so this site for the last
118:30 - project it was one server used
118:35 - JavaScript use node and then for another
118:38 - server we use PHP so the content
118:42 - management system was WordPress on one
118:44 - server running PHP and then the other
118:47 - server was react running no Jazz for
118:50 - this project it's it's going to be
118:52 - reacting nodejs and then I don't think
118:55 - we're even going to use a content
118:57 - management system we'll see I haven't
119:00 - decided for sure what I want to do
119:02 - depending on how much time I have for
119:04 - this I'm like kind of thinking about
119:07 - maybe either trying out one of the
119:09 - content management systems that runs on
119:11 - node or just trying out you know trying
119:16 - to do a database like maybe like MongoDB
119:18 - or something like that just working with
119:21 - it so I'll have to see like how what
119:25 - other projects are coming up and how
119:27 - important they are to get done I might
119:28 - not have time to work with that Emilia's
119:35 - hi Jesse Texas take a lot from you in
119:38 - the US but it is definitely a good
119:40 - salary globally I would say okay cool
119:42 - yeah I know it's it's pretty it's hard
119:44 - to compare you know salaries for our
119:48 - different places actually the best thing
119:51 - I've ever seen for that is called the
119:53 - Big Mac index I don't know if you ever
119:55 - heard about that but it basically just
119:56 - tells you how much it costs to buy a Big
119:59 - Mac from McDonald's all over the world
120:01 - and then like that's that's a the index
120:07 - you know that's the good measure I guess
120:11 - so I mean really like economists
120:13 - actually use that so
120:17 - than that it is kind of hard to compare
120:26 - let's see Alpina of CSS says I really
120:30 - appreciate you doing this could you make
120:32 - isomorphic app tutorial yeah I I mean
120:38 - I've said this a lot and I'm sorry I
120:40 - haven't been able to do it but I really
120:42 - do want to make some tutorials like
120:44 - pre-record them and put them on my
120:46 - channel and I'd like to do a tutorial
120:49 - using react or next j/s which will allow
120:53 - you to very easily make an isomorphic
120:58 - yes or says thank you for your honesty
121:01 - yeah no problem
121:02 - like I said I'm I'm pretty open about
121:04 - salary stuff so and my salary it's not
121:09 - like it's uh I mean there there are
121:13 - people to make doing the same thing I do
121:15 - and make a lot more and I'm sure there
121:17 - are people doing the same thing that I
121:18 - do they make less - but I can pay the
121:21 - bills and support my family so that's
121:23 - that's really what matters I mean I'm
121:25 - sure everybody could always say they
121:26 - wish I had more but you know at the end
121:28 - of the day you know I have it I have
121:32 - enough to survive one so and I like what
121:35 - I do
121:37 - Emilia says here in Guatemala average
121:39 - front-end programmer makes you I'm
121:41 - $1,000 for 40 hours a week okay
121:53 - cool that's interesting I know there's a
121:55 - big at least I've read before that
121:58 - there's a big difference and what
122:00 - developers get paid in different
122:02 - countries so like right now in the
122:03 - United States developers get paid a lot
122:06 - compared to other jobs but I've heard
122:09 - that in some countries it's not like
122:10 - that so you know for whatever reason in
122:14 - the United States right now they need
122:17 - more developers so they're willing to
122:19 - pay a higher higher amount
122:36 - alright Joseph said I'm changing a Wi-Fi
122:39 - signup portal from PHP my sequel to
122:41 - react sequel Lite 3 or react
122:46 - that's really cool I'd like to see if
122:48 - that's Joseph if that's a project that
122:50 - could be made available on github that
122:53 - would be really cool to see so send me a
122:55 - link if your your able to put that on
122:59 - github and I would be really interested
123:01 - in seeing it AB I know CSS says you are
123:07 - a really great tutor and I know that
123:09 - this is time consuming time that you can
123:11 - spend with your child but it would be
123:13 - great to get some clarifications in your
123:15 - style yeah yeah like I said I do really
123:23 - want to do some more stuff so you know
123:25 - we'll see how it goes
123:27 - I actually I mean I don't have nearly
123:31 - enough subscribers yet to even think
123:33 - about getting money from YouTube but
123:36 - maybe one day I can justify like doing
123:40 - more video right now it's just hard to
123:42 - justify like go home and say to my wife
123:43 - like hey I'm gonna take a couple of
123:45 - hours and make youtube videos and not
123:47 - get anything out of it
123:49 - but if I could say like you know hey I I
123:52 - could potentially get like ad revenue or
123:55 - something you know then that would be
123:57 - justifiable you know for me to say like
124:00 - it's it's almost like a second job and
124:04 - then then at least I could say you know
124:07 - I'm providing some more money for my
124:09 - family and then it might be more doable
124:12 - for me to produce stuff more regularly
124:14 - but for right now I'm you know that's
124:17 - that's like probably a long long way off
124:20 - if if it ever happens but I will try to
124:26 - make some tutorials when I can
124:32 - - CSS is we get $1700 monthly in Croatia
124:37 - for four years a week okay cool
124:41 - that is cool I really I'm really
124:43 - interested in what people get Jarek says
124:49 - are you working as freelance or in-house
124:51 - or something yeah I work at a university
124:53 - so I'm a full-time front-end developer
124:56 - for for University and then I do some
125:00 - work on the side like freelance work but
125:03 - I I don't really like to do a lot unless
125:06 - it's a project I'm really interested in
125:08 - or I'll make a lot of money off it
125:11 - because I'm pretty busy so I'd rather
125:14 - not take up more of my time than I need
125:17 - to pop I know CSS says okay you need
125:22 - wife permission in the frowny face in a
125:24 - smiley face yeah I mean like basically
125:30 - because I couldn't if I were to want to
125:33 - take more time to do that that would
125:34 - mean that I wouldn't be able to watch
125:36 - the kids and I would have to ask my wife
125:38 - to watch all four of our kids and then
125:40 - she wouldn't have time to do any of the
125:42 - things that she would like to do you
125:43 - know normally when I get home from work
125:45 - I watched the kids right so otherwise
125:50 - she would have them all day every day
125:51 - with no breaks so that's what I mean
125:54 - when I say I'd have to be able to
125:56 - justify that so if if I went home and
126:00 - said hey wife why don't you why don't
126:04 - you watch the kids for another couple
126:06 - more in a couple of hours you know with
126:08 - no break so I can just go make youtube
126:10 - videos right then then that wouldn't
126:14 - sound as good but if I could say like
126:15 - hey I'm gonna make a bunch of money off
126:18 - of ads on YouTube if I put out you know
126:21 - three or four videos a week then it
126:24 - might make her a little bit more happy
126:25 - and she could have so you see I don't
126:28 - does that make sense that it would just
126:30 - be I don't know if you're married maybe
126:32 - you you understand Mike Scioscia kids
126:34 - like it would be it just seems like to
126:39 - me
126:40 - it's it's a lot easier to make the case
126:44 - for me to do more and in terms of work
126:49 - if the the payoff is greater so anyway
126:54 - okay this before yes I do have four kids
126:59 - yeah so from 8 years old down to 9
127:03 - months old and I have two girls and two
127:08 - boys all right so I've gotten to the end
127:11 - of the live chat and that's about yeah
127:16 - that's over to our video at this point
127:20 - but if you have any any other questions
127:26 - you know feel free to reach out to me on
127:28 - Twitter okay there's one more question
127:30 - in there Jay rec says how long have you
127:33 - been working as a dev at the University
127:36 - it's been about two years but before
127:39 - that I was freelance for about three
127:42 - years I think so all in all about five
127:49 - years like that I was seriously
127:51 - developer I mean I I did some websites
127:54 - here and there before that but I
127:56 - wouldn't say that I was a serious you
127:58 - know developer until about like five
128:03 - five years ago or so and I really well I
128:06 - wouldn't would not have called myself
128:08 - like a true developer that first year I
128:12 - was really just learning a lot Oh
128:20 - aim highs here yeah sorry you're you're
128:23 - too late we're about to end so you can
128:25 - catch the the recording it'll be
128:31 - available yeah and and give me an update
128:34 - on how the job is going to you can
128:37 - message me on on Twitter or something so
128:40 - I'm interested okay all right so for
128:44 - real this time
128:45 - I'm gonna be done so thank you so much
128:47 - for watching tomorrow the stream is

128:58 - tomorrow and have a great day I'll see
129:02 - you all tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody is Jessie and today we have some pool requests to go over and have to make a decision for sure this time of weather we're gonna use the beta material UI or not I know you're probably tired of even thinking about this question at this point also I today has been today and last night have been really really frustrating so since my my whole purpose for doing this at least at first was to give people a realistic view of what my job as a frontend developers like I'm gonna briefly explain what what the day has been like just to give you a more accurate picture so as you know I'm working on the udacity react nanodegree so I am I keep submitting my project and the way it works in Udacity is you submit your project and then they do a code review and then they send you feedback on your code and let you know if it's if it's working properly or not so it it hasn't been working properly and the first you know two times I submitted him okay you know that's legitimate it's some good feedback should have tested it more but then last night I I thought I had it I thought I had had gotten it and so I I was frustrated so I stayed up late last night I worked on it and then I thought for sure I have it the Sun I woke up this morning and I still didn't fix what I need I think some of it but there was still you know one thing that I didn't test and it didn't work so that is just super frustrating especially because I'm so tired today since I stayed up late to do that but anyway that's not that's not even the worst part so I get to work I started doing my work it gets right around time when I have a meeting right before my lunch break so instead of going to the meeting I just kind of remoted in right from my office so there was like a screen share thing set up so I remote it in late because I had just gotten an email from a client that their site was down which was really worrying because I set up that site in a similar way to what we did this this catechetical Institute site the last time so I checked it out and it turns out they had like a spike in in traffic and the database just shut down on the server that was running WordPress so I couldn't figure it out couldn't get it up and running spent my entire lunch break that I was going to spend working on Udacity on that luckily I still had the development version of that WordPress install on a different server so one one that I pay for not the company so I just pointed the subdomain to that server so that the site is now back up and it buys me time to figure out what happened with that so I'm I'm really interested in what happened because I don't want it to happen to any of the other sites that I built like that so on top of that I get an email from somebody who's been continually insisting that a site that I had built an internal site for for the university I work for they couldn't access it so it is you have to login to the site and I can't I've been trying to actually go to see this person at their computer and they've never give me a time when I could go to see them they've had other people from the IT department go there who of course haven't been able to fix it because they're not developers and the problem is likely you know maybe some type of error I don't know I don't really know what the problem is so I get another email from this person saying they try to login and it didn't work so I checked my error logs I'm not 100% sure yet I'll give you an update on this one I know for sure but this is what I saw when I checked my error logs around the same time that I got the email about the error I got this error log and just I just want to zoom in on this part so in case that's not immediately sinking in whoever got this this error was using Internet Explorer 9 to try to view my site now I don't I don't know about you if you all support Internet Explorer 9 in your projects but I make no attempt to support Internet Explorer 9 and so that was just if it turns out that this was in fact the error message from the person who was trying to log in I'm gonna be I'm gonna be somewhat relieved and really annoyed at the same time not at this person at all I mean certainly you know I think most people probably don't even realize what version of a browser they're using but I will be super annoyed that for months now I've been trying to figure out this problem and it's potentially not even really my fault it's it's just the fact that it's you know it's Internet Explorer 9 so anyway that's been my day so far but then after all that happened my wife brought me pizza which was cool and I got to see the baby for a few minutes and she was being really cute so so anyways so that brings me to right now and I'm gonna show you the the pull request that I got and we have some cause for celebration today and I'll show you in a minute yeah Sebastian says in the live chat Pizza fixes everything so yeah it was it was good as you know I frequently just work and don't eat all day so it is really nice when I actually eat feel a lot better usually towards the end of the stream I'm just exhausted and hungry but today I will not be alright so let me let me show you I was just trying to think if I forgot anything I don't think so alright let me show you this pull request that I just merged into the material UI betta branch so this is from Rohit and sorry if I'm mispronouncing the name but I just wanted to especially show you this because this is his first pull request that's been accepted so you could check it out this was the first pull request and does it show up to the X that I accepted it I don't know but anyway I think I think that this is the first pull request that that he's had submitted that's been accepted so that's really cool so congratulations so basically what what he's managed to do is to get this site so obviously it's not perfect like there's still some weird things going on probably based on the markup that I had but the the point of the pull request was to fix those errors so this is no longer showing any errors all right I'd still need to get this working in terms of the side nav and you know fixing this positioning and things but yesterday we worked and worked and we couldn't even get to a point where we could even see anything except an error message so this is awesome so this actually makes it more of a possibility that we could use the beta I'm I still kind of don't want to after yesterday because that was a lot of work so if I run into similar issues I I don't really want it to slow me up I'm already I'm I actually expected to be a lot farther along at this point than I am so anyway so I went ahead and merged it into that that material you I beta branch just so that it's there because you know maybe in a few days we realized that the other version of material UI is just going to be too hard to work with what we want to do and I want to try it again or maybe down the road you know if I I go to redo this again maybe I'll want to use material UI beta I mean who knows but I thought it was worth it to have a on this branch a version that didn't throw errors immediately I never really liked the idea of pushing to get hub a branch that didn't work so thanks again roulade for that for that pull request and he actually submitted to pull requests so the first one was a theme fix but at least for me it through an error and I think the only thing was it was just it had a lot of stuff from the master branch that it wasn't the beta so it just wasn't working right and then you know almost immediately after I made some comments on the first pull request he came back with this with a second one so that was really awesome oh hey cool really it's in the live chat so and says thank you so much for accepting the pool request you're welcome thank you for submitting that I'm actually I'm really I'm excited for two things one that you submitted the pool question was awesome also that it's your first pour across I think it's really cool that I got to to accept that like that that's a big deal to me all right so I'm gonna check the live chat quickly just to say hi to everyone all right so if you are if you're new welcome and thanks for watching so this this show in case you haven't watched before is me doing my normal everyday work so there will be mistakes and some days it seems like it's all mistakes but we usually manage to work through the problems eventually and build some cool things so I'm gonna try to keep up with the live chat and every so often I'm gonna check back in so if you ask a question I don't get to it right away please don't don't be upset by that I will get to it and if you can't stick around I'll still try to answer it you can watch the recording later and get the answer so basically if you haven't seen the other streams for this project we're building a react project we use create react app to build it you know start it and then we're using material UI which is a material design framework for or for building the layout in react apps so this is my first time using the tear UI so we're still we're kind of learning as we go also there's two other ways to participate in this stream today so of course I have the Instagram feed that is showing my face whenever I'm whenever I'm doing this and I have a cool you can barely see in the background but today I turned on my little plasma ball a USB flash my ball so I guess if it was darker you could see it more but anyway it's cool my kids always like to play with it when they come to my office so if you are already watching on Instagram and you don't realize that you can see the code on youtube check out free code cancer YouTube channel and then there's a third way so I mentioned that I had n Drock working so let me give you the link and you should be able to see the site as I am developing it so I'm gonna paste this link in the live chat but if you're not in the live chat or you're watching this later on which I'll probably keep and rock on so there's a chance if you're watching it a little bit later on today you can still see the site but it won't be on all the time so if you are watching it later and it doesn't work then my computer's off or something but otherwise you know you might have a shot if you're watching maybe an hour or two after so here's the link in the live chat Blake asks about the Instagram feed it's there should be a link in the description to this video my Instagram name I think is Jessie dot Weigel so cool I can see that you all are actually trying to view this so that's awesome so if you remember we tried to do this maybe month ago maybe more and it just immediately like shut down because we hit the limit on the amount of requests so I explained a few days ago I think that the person who does end ruk and I think his name's Alan let me double check I want to give this guy credit because I really appreciate it so I'm I'm actually gonna check my my email right now to make sure that I get his name right and I'll probably put something on Twitter to thanking him since that's how he first reached out to me I think it was Outland yeah so Alan Shrieve who is I don't know if he's I don't know exactly what he is with n Grunk if he made it if he's in charge of of maintaining it I'm not sure but anyway he basically just hooked us up saying you know that this will work so I don't know what he said the Linnet too but it looks like it's working fine I haven't normally I would have gotten a message to say it said it crashed ok so right now we got a lot of connections and it seems to be working so so that's that's awesome so now I'll run this you know whenever pretty much anytime I stream and you all can just immediately see the feedback of what's going on so that should really help you know you got you can open up dev tools now and see the same errors and inspect things and you won't have to just see what's on my screen so hopefully that'll make this way more interactive I mean there's already a lot of interaction in the live chat and that's awesome but I think this was this was a really really good idea I think it was Fabian's idea a while back so Fabian hesitant I don't think he's been able to join in in the live chat for a while I haven't seen him I might have seen him last week or something but so he's probably not watching now but if he does watch this thank you for this idea it was for really awesome all right so enough of all the the introductory stuff I'm gonna switch for now I think I'm gonna switch back to the master branch so like I said earlier I'm I just I don't want to do anything with the beta right now so it was really I don't know it was really like a little bit frustrating yesterday when I tried to work on it and we just couldn't get it working so I don't want to repeat of that so I'm gonna switch back to the master branch let me do this on the screen so I can see this so so if you're not that familiar with git you want to switch branches you do get check out and then you do the name of the branch okay so now I've switched to the master branch and I want to make sure cuz I don't think I've done pushed anything up oops get pull not masterful oh all right so get pool so it's always fresh whenever you start out it you always want to do a get pool just in case even if you're the only person working on it it's possible that you might have pushed something from another computer and you just forgot that's actually happened to me that's happened to me during the livestream now because I frequently work on a laptop when I'm not in my office so let me move this out of here and let's see run yarn just make sure the package is so different packages switching back and forth between branches and let me restart this server as well so it's it's showing an error right now that's why I'm doing all this so that should fix it alright so here we go we're back to this we have this little highlight here working thanks to Sebastian's pull request everything that's showing up here is a different component so you know as it should be in react you know all these little pieces that you see are all separate components so you know this app bar is separate and then we the side nav is is all separate and then this section here is totally separate so that's the way we want it so now I think we ought to build out the the home view so why not why not start there that's the first page everyone will see so we'll start right there and I guess we could change the title to that's the only other like really obvious thing that we could change is it's obviously not going to be title so let's yeah let's change that I want to start out with a win I know if I change that it won't cause an error and that'll be one one thing that we can say even if everything else fails at least we get that done so where am I I know this is sad enough now that everything is in components I'm not sure where it if where the title is an app all right app are there we go I'm pretty sure I made this component so maybe I did maybe that's why I didn't realize maybe this isn't one Sebastian made oh wait a second it should not be like this I think it's is it holding on I'm going to close out a bunch of this stuff occasionally when I check out and switch from a branch the code editor doesn't immediately switch everything over and it holds on to the to the old markup so in particular for that one it was still showing the code that we weren't even using anymore at all so let's try I think it's sad enough yep that's it so it's inside enough this this makes more sense this is how it should look alright so let's change it to resource center and I think Sebastian also submitted a poor request but he basically said in the the comments for the for his request that it would probably just be better to go with a stable version so that's why I didn't even I didn't I didn't pull it in but I think he actually did change the title least I thought he did I don't maybe maybe he didn't I don't know now that I look at it on my other screen I don't see that so I don't know where I'm getting that from all right so let's check it out it's this resource center awesome ok so since we don't have column classes builtin to the the material UI the version of material you I that we're using I I kind of think we should I think we ought to use some of the stuff from materialized because already familiar with that so here's what I'm thinking that we could use assuming that there's not a lot of conflicts between class names which we'll have to double check that we may be able to just blend these two not use any of the any of the jQuery related stuff for JavaScript related stuff at all from materialized but basically just take their column classes and use that so if there's any objections to that let me know I just would rather not have to build out a column class system if I don't have to like from scratch because I already know how much the materialized system works I'm really familiar with it now I just checked back in the live chat and I see Sebastian saying please change the active color Patrick Gass please tell me that bright yellow is a placeholder yeah yeah the brainy the bright yellow is definitely a placeholder tor I don't know if it's supposed to be tor tor aI don't know but says maybe you should create two folders component in container to store your code yeah actually I had I had created a component folder when I was trying to get the beta to work and so I obviously that that didn't happen so I do I am going to create a folder to hold the components and organize this a little bit better so like I said I had done it once and then broke everything so that got thrown out when I threw out all the things that broke all right I was just checking the live chat there so sorry about the little silent time oh cool patrick said I love that hot reloading is even working over an Gras yeah I didn't I I figured it would work I wasn't really sure what to expect but so far this seems like really really useful all right so it seems like no one wants this bright yellow there so let's change that so I guess we're in the apt CSS yep alright so we don't want that to be yellow let's check out the material design documentation and see what it's supposed to be I could never I'm on the site often but I don't know why the URL doesn't come up when I type it in okay so that's C cool this is what I wanted I just wanted to get this the material design documentation seems to actually use the material design spec which is as it should be I suppose so I'm not even really gonna look this up I'm just going to inspect it and see what color they use that will be faster why is this much okay when I I have it on on the other screen I had taken it took the focus off so I couldn't see but this is pretty easy he's just using it's gray let's see how that looks cool all right much much nicer to look at and it's actually a different gray than what we see when we hover so does that bother anybody that gray is different I mean should it be different since the different thing is happening or should we try to make it the same I don't really care at this point I can always change that later on but let me know what you think if you if you have a preference okay cool so get the important things taken care of a title and we have a new color for the active link so let's let's commit that so we have one working commit so let's check our status and see we've edited the app CSS file and the side nav JSS file and I want to commit both of these at the same time with a commit message and we're gonna add them as well so to do that we're going to type git commit and then we're gonna give it the flag am so a is going to add it and an means we're going to put a message right after that so within quotation marks and you could do double or single quotes we're gonna put our commit message and we're gonna say change title so they're actually different I guess different ways to do commit messages so different places have guidelines for how you do it so right now I'm not really using any guidelines except that I don't do anything in the past tense so I don't ever say change title it's always changed title so that's pretty much what what I adhere to I also try to keep them as short as I possibly can and I usually don't use punctuation but sometimes I forget and just put in a punctuation mark but if you want to use something that's standard and I mean if you're just starting out and you want to start with good habits you can check out I think Udacity has their own standard so you can go I think it's available somewhere on the site I don't I don't know if the link is right now but if you check out the Udacity get you know commit message standard it's pretty straightforward if you're taking Udacity course they want you to stick to it and I'm sure there are other companies that have their own standards so I would actually recommend doing that so your commit messages are more uniform because mine are are not they're all over the place at some point I'll probably have set a standard for everybody in my department to use and potentially like everybody who contributes to any of the projects but for right now there is no standard and let's push this so we've committed this so this is only on our local machine if we want this to be to be reflected in github we got to push it so we do a git push origin master since we're on the master branch and now this change is reflected in github which is awesome because you know if the power goes out this computer shuts down we could just turn on our laptop and running a WiFi from our phone and get on github and keep working I've actually done that before is that ever happen to you all I gotta keep my laptop here and so the Power has gone out and shut the computer down so I just opened my laptop and keep going alright so Zach says it's different and he gives he gave me the hex code for the color that's the real color so alright so because you you are nice enough to give me the color I'll change it right now so that we have the same color let's check it out now there's a networking oops did I mess it up wait a second that is not that's not the color that is blue cool Nathaniel says back when I lived in Snowden land Elizabeth City power outages were a more common thing so I used mobile tethering in my laptop Zack says sorry wasn't the color just my favorite one that was a good color I mean I like that color it's just not in the color palette that I can use for university projects actually if you don't mind I think I may try that color out on my my project for Udacity because I'm I wanted to use a blue color I picked a different shade but I really like that shade so maybe I'll maybe I'll use it I don't want to steal your color though cuz you you you put it in the chat first so I think you have dibs on it for a while at least alright so now let's let's start with some of these classes I guess the first thing I want to do is I just want to look and this is just on my other screen briefly at some of the class names that are coming out just to see about conflicts so let's look I have the material UI documentation here as well so see actually let me close that I had to do a performance management selfassessment so I think I have a meeting on Friday actually I should let you all know Friday I'm gonna have to stream at a different time and tomorrow I will so tomorrow at a normal time I'll be finishing up a technical interview with the candidate for web developer job so I'll probably just bump it ahead to like 230 so it won't be a big change but Friday everyone here gets to leave at noon which is awesome so I will be here at the normal time so maybe I'll do it I'll have to do it the early because I have my performance review at I think 1130 somewhere around there so I'll let you all know about the difference but I just want to give you a heads up so that you're not you know surprised if I'm not on during my normal time all right so I want to check I want to check some of this stuff out so once again I'm assuming maybe wrongly that this site is using material UI so we inspected it before and we thought figured out that they weren't actually using it for some parts of it actually now that I look at the code I'm not I'm not sure that they're using it at all let me I'm just I have dev tools open on my other screen so if you if you want to check it out you can you know just open dev so you'll be seeing what I'm saying but not really sure so maybe I can't do okay in any case let's just grab what I'd like to do is actually make make components to do what we want him to do so I don't want to just throw CSS in there so that's what we did for the last project and that was okay for the last project because we needed to get a lot done in a short amount of time for this project there's not quite as much that needs to get done so we already have basically the site that it doesn't really need to change we just need to turn it from the jumbled mess of jQuery that it is into a react site but we can basically keep most of the Styles the same so we won't have to worry about that it's it's basically just me working on it this is my project the way the layout is right now was already approved by everybody that it needs to be approved by so I don't have to keep going back and forth to do revisions so because of all that I think that we can take the time now to do this in a more proper way and actually create components that will work and that we can reuse and bring forward in our future projects so that's what I'd like to do okay I just I just noticed here down at the bottom of the live chat one says Jesse I would suggest maybe you can work each feature in a branch too so get usage to actually that's that's a really good idea I think I'm gonna do that so yeah actually I do like I have people of all skill levels that watch this so I'm sure there's a decent number of people that don't use git yet or just really new it gets oh that's a great idea so we'll get used to making branches and merging and things that'll be that'll be cool I will I will do that Tiffany asks which course or courses are you taking with you dasa T hey Tiffany I'm pretty sure that I haven't seen you in live chat before so thank you thank or for watching and joining in I am taking the reacts nanodegree right now I've also done a lot of the frontend courses but just the the free versions so I will say this about the paid version the I normally go for the free versions of everything but in this case with the paid version since you get to keep submitting your projects and get feedback I'm I'm like forced to learn a lot more than I normally would so I think in it can be worth it so if you don't have somebody else to look at your code then the paid version is really really nice because like I said I I thought my app was working like for revisions ago like for code reviews ago and it wasn't so if I had just been doing a free verse they don't have a free version of the react nanodegree yet but if if they had one available and I've been doing that I would have just moved on and assume that my app worked but now I'm being forced to learn the right way to do it and it's not just the feedback that I get is not always just this is wrong do it right some of it is just suggestions like this is right but if you want to make it even better you could do it this way so that's really really helpful so I think I had said I would give you all updates on how it's going so that's probably so far the biggest takeaway that I have is that I had no experience with code reviews before and I really like them I mean it's frustrating when you get it back and you've done it wrong but I learn a lot from it so so anyway that's that's my experience thus far I'll give you an update something else Athens alright let's see I had some some comments about the colors here okay so it's Joseph says looks like the darker color and lighter one okay so let me cool Zack said I can use his color in my my Udacity project so awesome I'll do that 81 was your football number cool so you're a receiver that's usually your receiver number my number was 14 alright so I think I'd like to grab the lighter color all right cool Zach says wide receiver kicker and ponder cool I was right wide receiver yeah uh once you get up into the 80s that's receiver yeah I was a quarterback and outside linebacker all right so let me switch actually is what I really want to do is I want to use the lighter color for everything so I don't want to change that active color I want to change the highlight color have to figure out where that's at where's my where's my menu item all right so I think it talks about the menu items at the bottom of this area override styles actually I'm not sure if I can I'm assuming that this is on hover so I I don't think I can override it here because that would be an inline style you can't do hover stuff on inline styles right I'm pretty sure you can't do it let me double check this that it is in fact a hover is it not I think I'm on the wrong this is interesting so let me show you what's going on here whoa let's do the holy city said alright so I'm going through here and trying to add the hover so like over here I'm just going and clicking hover and dev tools and none of these are actually making a change this maybe is this one no what else could I even put this one okay so everything here alright so let's see so it's actually so it's actually not a CSS hover effect which is that's interesting I will I just assumed it was so it's acts it's a let me see what changes huh all right so it looks like the only thing that's changing is just that the background color does change so that's really interesting all right so I guess we can I I really wanted to use like the the actual you know props here but I guess I could just put it in the CSS file it is all right so I guess we'll just change this actually I am gonna have to I am gonna figure out have to figure out how to change this because it's it's not he's actually changing the color like this background color seems like it's part of the state let's check out that component for a minute actually forget it this is a side check this would be something to do later on I don't want to get sad jacked with this probably just because I'm really tired it was easy for me to get sidetracked that's an unimportant thing right now that can go in the list of things to do later on I can I can live with it being a different color just for now and I could always just change it change this to be the same color and that'll be a lot easier so let's grab some of the material that's scarier I was hoping that the github would be in my my drop down there but it wasn't okay so let's go to it's a lot easier actually to go to the SAS and see what grid see what we need actually now that I think about it the problem had before is that it's really hard to just pull part of this since it depends on a lot of variables and other files so I think I will just go to the CSS then if you're not familiar with sass it's a whoops wrong spot if you're not familiar with sass oops it is a CSS preprocessor so you can do more than you can do with normal CSS you can have like variables and some logic in there and you can combine like separate files together and so it's really cool but I wanted I want to see this file this the CSS is what gets produced when you you know compile it all to normal CSS so what I'm gonna do is I know call us the column is what I want I never eyes there's so many thing with call in it oh my goodness there we go that's to search for a row so I want these container classes and everything and actually before I do this let me I just want to check I want to check I don't really know that much about licenses so I want to make sure that I give attribution properly or if I'm even allowed to pull out part of this okay its MIT license I know enough to know the MIT license is pretty pretty open let me see if they actually have a license there you go okay so basically it seems like I can do whatever I want and use this as long as I keep this this license with it which I don't really see any reason why I couldn't have an MIT license on my project as well if anyone had knows of any good reasons why I shouldn't then let me know now but that's not really a big deal I don't really care if anybody uses any of my stuff okay cool so let's let's do that then let's put a license on our project and then we'll grab this and we should be good and let me know if someone knows more about licenses and I'm making a mistake here let me know please in the live chat obviously Sebastian said might be using jsm else over to change background color yeah that's what I think I think it's probably using that that's what I was gonna look at the component to see before I realized that that was just kind of a waste of time because I had better things to do all right so let's I want to do this license thing first because otherwise I'll probably just put it off and never do it and I think it'd be cool to show you all how to do this so there's a really easy way to do a license within github so I mean obviously we could just copy and paste that which would be really easy but I'd like to show you this in case you want to use a different license where's my site Resource Center right yeah okay so if we go in here and go to create new file and then type in he's got a I see yet no I can't i spell license hey I seriously spelled license correctly last night license right no with all right somebody help me out what is wrong with me li si en se right right yeah all right what's supposed to happen maybe I have to put in caps what's supposed to happen is that there's something supposed to come up on this side that'll let you just pick a license why this has worked last night for me my eyes are not working right now dear refresh this page there we go okay this is what's supposed to happen if you manage site license correctly the first time you can choose a license template right so you click this and you can go in here and pick a license and it'll tell you all kinds of things about that license so you can go through and pick which one you need so that's what I really wanted to show you because this is pretty cool if you're not sure about it you can go to learn more but this can help you if if you're not exactly sure about your license so I'm gonna pick the MIT license see it already fills in everything for me it even fills in the year and the name in this case it's the name of the organization otherwise like on my on my own github it puts in my name so you know I should I want to see full name of copyright owner I'm gonna put my name because so technically when I started working here I signed no contract so I pretty much control the code that I write so that there's nothing there's nothing that says that my code like that I can't use elsewhere so I'm gonna interpret that as I can use it however I want and other projects and so let's go to review and submit so you can check it out here it is and we have a license file and I wanted that's V dot MD cool awesome and then right from here we can we can if we wanted to create a new branch for this commit and then start a pull request actually let's do that since like one said it would be cool to get more practice with git so let's start a new branch for a pull request and then we'll merge this request in and since I already know what's happening here like will do it through the github interface and then in the future we'll do them through the command line cool so now we're gonna open a pull request create license I don't think I really need to write anything that's we know what that means and you can see it shows the changes we've created a new file so really easy to tell what's going on and let's create the pull request now I can see this pull request this pull request number seven and let's merge it and there's they're actually options so we can merge the pull request and there'll be a merge commit and so this just says exactly what's happening and I'm gonna confirm the merge and then now if we go back to our local machine we can run a get pool and we have our license all right so cool successful thing number two that we've done today all right so now I saw something Sebastian said material.you I actually does have a grid system so Sebastian material oh I just want to let you all know the the live the live stream from Instagram has ended so that oh that has a one hour time limit so if you want to check it out the videos available for 24 hours after I recorded so Sebastian if there is a great system I know I couldn't find one before I found one with the beta version but I couldn't find a grid system with the old version so am I just am I missing something or is it just with the beta also Sebastian found out how to edit that that color add this to the list item hover color Alexander says hey from Russia love your coding sessions Jessie thanks and thanks for watching I really appreciate it okay Sebastian is saying grid list I checked out grid list a few days ago and I it wasn't what I wanted I mean maybe it would get the job done but it was not what I really had in mind with with the grid system let's see what was I gonna I was gonna change the the hover color so I'm assuming that on here I can change the hover color Wow I don't think that you saw that but if you you ever had your hands like one key off I just I had them one key off and then it just messes up everything yes like I guess see Joseph said as well I could put it in a theme but I'm not really gonna use these the same way anywhere else so I think I'll just do it like this for now assuming that this will work and what was the color we were using let's see if that works not yet No okay so Joseph said menu item won't work because it doesn't pass the prop okay so I will need to then put this in our theme are we even using a theme yeah we made this right this is a few esteem okay Sebastian said added to the list item not the menu item actually I'm not yeah okay Joseph that's what I was just thinking I can't put it on the list item because it's generated by menu items so anyway I'm just I'll figure that out at a different time I really want to move over this this code from materialized to where did I have okay so let's try to grab everything we need should basically all the column classes and it'll probably be obvious pretty early on whether or not they're conflicts as far as the class names go if that happens we'll figure out what to do but maybe it won't happen okay oh that's cool they actually have an Excel class builtin I remember for a project I made my own Excel classes you used to have it was just small medium and large so I should have submitted a pull request for that I could have got this in oh well I just didn't have time at the time to really clean it up and submit so all right so now we have all that let's let's pull in all right so would it make I think it would make sense to have a Styles folder so let's do that so from the command line we can create folders by doing make directory and we can do so you want this to be within source and let's call it styles so now we have that directory and now we want to create a new file so we're going to use the command touch source styles and we'll call this materialize grid and that's a CSS file okay so now we have the Styles folder and we have this materialize grid and then we can put all of our grid styles in here all right so everything's in here and we'll save that and then we can pull that in oops I meant meant to get the app j/s so we can pull that in here in our app das and importer here and then it'll be available for us to use for for all of our stuff so if we could see here we already have an import of a CSS file so let's just copy that and then import the column classes here and so what we want is to go into the Styles folder and then materialise grid okay let's check it out all right so so far nothing weird has happened now we should be able to use the materialized classes so let's go into our home view I'll switch it back up let's go into our home view and try to try to use some of them I just remembered I forgot to use my Pomodoro clock again this is two days in a row so I don't think I'm gonna use it now it's in something this far in whereas okay we have views and home okay so within our home view I want this all to the inside of a container and then within that container we're gonna have a a row and then within the row of columns and we'll do s 12 medium 4 and that should give us our 3 okay and actually we don't need that anymore we have two missing one Dave okay so we have this and let's just put depending on what the fonts doing with material you I may we may want to bring in that that flow text responsive font class from materialized as well because I kind of like that and it would match a lot of what we're doing with other sites so let's just make loose nice one three okay and save it and see what we have what did I do all right so obviously I didn't really have an error in index so where's my ear probably in home since that's the only thing we change let me see what have I done there we go 97 no i'm jazz all right good call Alexander thank you and who else tor tor yeah yeah says try return awesome so all right cool check that out so we have our common classes and see if this works when we go small yes great this don't actually look centered though what's going on let me move this over so we can see this okay I see why it doesn't look centered because these are just right aligned so that's fine so this is actually the only one so this is our container which is full width with margins and the margins actually get smaller their bet percentage based but even the percentages themselves change there with the media queries so that's cool on small screens the margins are really small which is what we want this is our row this is our columns these are columns cool so that is working as we want let's throw some cards in here but let's use the material UI cards and then that'll be a kind of even better test of conflicts when we start intermixing more of the components from material UI you see I don't really like that font wait it's a 400 wait I think I like 300 yeah I like 300 better anyway I'll change that later I don't wanna get that checked alright let's throw in some cards so let's go back to our material UI documentation here and let's look up the cards let's make this a bit bigger so you want a card and we just want just wanted a really plain card let's see it joins the most plain none of it they don't you know have just a regular playing card alright so I just have to grab this and then take stuff out let's grab this card and probably I'll take out almost all of that stuff so I don't want the actions take out the card actions and don't want a title yeah I think I might want the title right now I think do I have explanatory text I do I think I have a title text and then instead of an image I have an icon so let's leave the card media maybe not I don't think I don't know I think I want to leave the card media how does this look yeah I don't really want it to appear like a separate section so let's take this out for now it'll just make it easier and I don't want the header okay so now we have a much more basic card which should be good for for our purposes let's pop these cards in here and then we need to import some things so let's import all this stuff and we can get rid of the stuff or not using once we pull it in so we don't need the card actions the card header or the card media okay save that see how it looks cool all right so we have these cards okay not bad they need definitely we need to work on our padding so in in materialize the cards themselves have the right padding so it usually doesn't happen like this so we'll have to just see if I mean maybe we want them to be closer together I don't I don't think that doesn't look I think I'd like to have a little bit more padding so other than some you know padding issues this is what we want I mean obviously we wanted to come down a bit we'll probably vertically align so we might actually grab the vertical alignment classes as well from materialise yeah now what we can do so basically we've put in the CSS and we've tested it and it pretty much does what we want it to do what we could do and what we may end up doing is making components where we could you know have a component that would let's say be column and then you would pass it you know what you wanted it to be and then that would end up being these things you know but it would be in the form of a component and we could do the same thing with row and container if we wanted to I'm not sure I don't know if it would be better to make these all components or if it would be better to leave someone like this I kind of if I had to say I would say the column is a much better candidate to be its own component than the row in the container just because you know the columns I mean it can change a lot they would be decent to be able you know pass props in and change what you want him to to have it would also be cool you know to change these based on you know a change in state so you could switch up your column so it would then be pretty easy to do something like I don't know have a toggle to say you can toggle between like a grid layout and a fullwidth layout you know just by clicking the button and then all the button would do would just just do a set state so that would be cool I the only place where that might be useful is maybe where we do the we're gonna do the image gallery for the logos otherwise I don't really think we need to use something like that so I mean currently we don't have that functionality so we don't really have to add it in okay I'm gonna go to the live chat well first let me let me copy this because basically this is going to be our layout so we're just going to do this twice cool and I'd like to see Wow there's a lot of things you can do with cards cool okay cool one thing I definitely want to do with these cards is make sure that they always stay the same height so we'll see how I want to do that I've done it before with some flexbox stuff which doesn't work it doesn't work well with the way everything was done in materialised but it might work better with this I'm not sure I'll have to look at the the markup that's created from the card component or we can do it by a bunch of media queries setting min heights which I'd rather not do it that way all right so I'm gonna check the live chat really quickly before I commit this in case there's something I should I should do differently and then after that if this is all good I'll commit this push it up to github and then I'll be taking some questions so if you were just here for the code probably not gonna be too much code left so thanks for watching if you want to I'm gonna quit watching now that's cool otherwise if you have questions put them in the live chat now worried if you can't stick around you can put them in the comments below or direct message me on Twitter hey Jeremy how's it going so Jeremy has joined us in the lab chat thanks for joining us okay looks like there's no messages related to these cards but but actually it looks so much better with content there I don't know about you but I mean it I mean obviously like this there needs to be space right there that looks terrible but actually having something here makes it look a lot better I can't that's one weight really bothers me I'm definitely gonna change that soon all right so let's oh ed we were gonna make different branches for each thing that we're doing right so let's see I think for now since with the end I'm just gonna commit this but then I'm gonna try to think out when I make my Trello cards I'm gonna try to make it a point to make each task in my Trello card a separate branch and then that'll be cool so we'll know when we move it to done at that point we will merge the branch and then we can keep track of things like that we can also I think there's a plugin or an addon in in Trello to where you can attach github issues or pull requests to a Trello card so we'll try that out that seems seems like it would be kind of cool to do so anyway for now I'm just gonna do a straight commit to the master branch also I had some advice from someone in the comments for YouTube saying that they usually have a dev branch they do everything on the dev branch and they they leave the master branch basically at a really basic level and only it's like periodically to the master branch so I'm kind of thinking about doing that so let me know what you think about that I think I was understanding what he was saying correctly I was actually gonna try to do it for this stream but I totally forgot just because of everything else that happened today all right so we're gonna commit and well first let's go status just to see what we changed okay cool so we can't do a regular git commit with the am flag because it won't add this okay so we actually need to add this so we could add it by name but since we're gonna add all this anyway at the same time let's um let's do get and then we can put a period and it'll add everything so now if we do get status we can see everything's ready now we can do a git commit and this time we don't need to add because we've already added we can just do the M for the message and we'll say call them classes actually it's more than just the column stuff would you really call it a greater is it a column system I don't know I'm not really that worried about it because I think we all kind of know what we're talking about when we say grid system page layout okay what do you mess up 300k we defined I forgot to get rid of this so that I think those were the buttons that were used in the action items in the card and we remove that section but we never remove that button so cool so now let's just so that commit actually never went through right it stopped it before that was committed so we can just press the UP button on our keyboard and it'll bring up that same thing and we can just hit enter again and run it again it should work this time assuming we didn't make any other mistakes and it did now we can do a git push and all right now it's on github okay so now we're good and doesn't matter what happens to our computer everything is on github and now I'm gonna check out the live chat so let me scroll up a bit and let's see I want to try to get everybody's questions if I happen to not get to your question just send me you know send me a message and I'll try to get to it and I know some of you have sent me stuff so either in the comments or on Twitter and I've tried to at least get back to everybody with with something even if it's like hey I'll check this out later so I just I've been really busy lately between my class and and work and everybody's birthdays this past weekend so I haven't forgotten about you I'll try to get to it when I can oh now I'm gonna be even more busy with my my client site like Christ database crashing but on to my best okay so open comment says anyone working on Drupal 8 actually no I'm not working on anything with Drupal 8 now I did briefly try it out but now I applied to speak at a drupal conference and talk about how you can use the drupal api with reacts but i didn't hear back from them so i don't know when they closed that but I didn't get anything so guessing I'm not gonna get into that conference so if I did get accepted then I was gonna look up more about Drupal but basically it's very similar to using the WordPress API so that's why I I applied to speak there Fred says hi I need a job Fred if you're if you're looking for a job if you um if you send me a tweet so like if if you're on Twitter put in a tweet like what kind of job you want and what your qualifications are and then tag me in it and then I'll retweet it and I don't have a lot of followers but most of the people that follow me are in you know the tech industry so they might know someone or know something so otherwise I can't really help you about getting a job not really in a position to give out hubs at this point but if any of you watching are get in touch with Fred Abdi says hi hey how's it going Nathaniel says I had to leave early yesterday can you let me know what I missed I don't think we did I think we spent most of the second half of the stream just going over questions so I don't think I actually coded anything okay I see a patrick said I wrote everything back yeah that's that's true I did I couldn't get it couldn't get the beta to work okay when when I was talking about my github branch and I was glad that I didn't have Arizona toin said I don't think it's bad to push a branch with errors to get hub as long as it is not master might be fun yeah I can kind of see that especially if you needed help with those errors and you're working on a team of course you would want to push it so that they could help so yeah I guess that's not really a big deal now that I think about it so yeah thanks for that that kind of made me think about it differently Blake said I'm loving these livestreams awesome I'm glad you're loving this dreams thanks for watching and participating in the live chat fred ass Hades Python in your projects I've never used Python in a project for a client I I took the intro to computer science course from Udacity and they use Python in that course so I did some Python with that but honestly I didn't even finish the course so I didn't do anything really advanced with Python but I kind of like Python it was really easy to work with it was cool like a lot of it was the syntax was kind of easy to write Daniel says I thank you for the live you're welcome thanks for watching and joining in live chat okay Sebastian says there's no need to add a general theme when using material UI if I only want to just apply something to a component because if I added theme to the root I'd have to add all the different customizations to the theme file and I'm assuming that's for the beta because obviously where we are using a theme file right now for this version so but that's good to know if I use the beta later on if any of you are planning on using the beta not really a need to do global theme if you really don't need to okay about halfway through the live chat now okay so he had some some of you recommending some themes so skeleton theme Patrick says get skeleton calm I've heard about that theme I have not used it and then harsh it says semantic UI is also great and it has react bindings to cool open comments ass is there react project one day one video looks like this is react project and how many days project one go to many days project one went so I for this project I started doing like the days because I think that'll be easier for people who want to watch later on and it's easier for me so for the first project I was trying to describe in the title of the video what I was going to do now I'm just gonna put that in the description and not the title the title is just gonna say what day it is and what project it is if maybe if I can fit some little descriptive thing in there I will but I think that'll be a little bit more helpful to keep track of everything because this playlist is going to end up being huge and have lots of different projects so I think it'll be better like this so if you want to go back to project one day one you have to actually go to my youtube channel and the links in the description for this video and find the video that's called building a website as fast as I can and if you start with that one and watch there I think there's maybe two or three of those on my channel and then I started streaming for free code camp and the rest of them are all in the live coding with Jesse playlist all in order there so it's a little bit confusing for that but hopefully it'll be a much easier system of naming from here on out I see Patrick pretty much said what I just said thanks pastor Sebastien says I have some issues with my PC for some reason opening tabs on Chrome and Firefox slows down my PC video and audio are d synced over time in YouTube don't know what to do might have to reinstall windows 10 to see what's causing the issue happens to a friend too but worse sarah says have you tried reinstalling Chrome or Firefox sebastian installed firefox only to see if it happens yeah that's uh I had that happen on my PC but it was a long time ago I don't know if I ever really found a solution for that either so I'm not really sure what was causing it I remember looking it up but I don't it's been years ago so I don't really remember what I found out sorry I can't help you more if I wanted to be a jerk I would just say like buy a Mac but I'm not I'm not gonna say this I'm not like a Mac only guy either I have pcs and a Chromebook and Linux servers so they all have their their pros and cons Sebastian says controversy that's not football okay yeah so for for all the non American people and I guess Canadian because they have football or at least americanstyle football when we were talking about football we did not mean what everyone else calls football that we call soccer so I should say that Zach and I played American football that's what they call it right in the rest of the world I'm pretty sure sorry I've never been out of the United States my knowledge of everywhere else is all secondhand so yes we I did not play soccer so when I was growing up the soccer wasn't really a thing where I was at so I played American football sorry if I offended anyone in Europe or or elsewhere pretty much the rest of the world is like called soccer football I think Oh Emmanuelle said that that son this was a while ago sorry I didn't see this in respond to it Manuel says the codes are blurry so yeah sorry about that maybe in terms of my connection it was it was really good it was over five thousand kilobits per second the whole time so it should be okay it's possible that somewhere between you and I the connection is slowing down or as Sarah mentions you could try changing the video settings sometimes that happens to me although I try to set it to auto or I try to set it to be HD all the time it always reverts to auto on YouTube and so even when I know I have a good connection sometimes it'll start me out at a really low quality and I have to manually change it although sometimes it corrects itself oh one says that you there's choose a license com so I showed how to do the license through github but if you would like to see a different place where you can get information on licenses you can use choose a license com I've never been there so that's not an official endorsement I'm just saying what once it MFC 88 thank you for spelling out license properly for me I think I've said this before but it's crazy how much I misspelled when I'm livestreaming and I normally can spell it fine I mean I'm not gonna say I'm a great speller obviously like autocorrect is ruined me and I don't even bother spelling things properly anymore but I normally can type and spell pretty well but not whenever I'm loud okay David said you can do the same thing alright in terms of adding the the license by going into the insights tab actually I don't think I've ever done that let's check it out inside where can I okay cool so from the insights tab you can add alright so we do ever readme we have a license we have no code of conduct or guidelines for contributing so maybe we should add these in a future stream that would be cool to have this kind of properly built out especially since we we are getting contributions so yeah maybe we'll do that thanks for that I never realized you could you could click that and one says there's also an option to choose a license when you create the project and github so I usually just skip that because I'm always like when I start a project I'm either not sure what its gonna be for sure or I'm in a hurry and but that would probably be a better thing to do and just be pick the license right off the bat and not worry about it Jordan said what would I miss and that was like at least a half an hour ago so sorry for not answering then basically we were just kind of changing the title and the color of the active page in the side nav we added a license we copied over some styles from materialized and then I think at that point you're already here so you saw the rest of it so didn't miss much I went over pool request to Marvin said that indentation gave me cancer was it when I think when I was working on this the indentation was really crazy so I don't worry about it anymore because I know it's all gonna get fixed every time I commit but yeah sometimes it just looked crazy that's what's a what's a good CSS framework besides bootstrap Blake says get skeleton comm wants his foundation also skeleton evidently does not have a CDN I I liked materialised as an alternative to bootstrap but if you're going to use react you may not want to go with materialized because a lot of stuffs done through jQuery and you don't really want to manipulate the Dom with jQuery if you're using react okay so it looks like some people use foundation as a framework also Joseph says I'm trying out semantic UI and my next project okay AdMob and says branches this is we're talking about doing separate branches branches only really makes sense if you have to work on different things parallely is that it's Eduard Parri lovely I probably would have said in parallel now I'm probably gonna have to look that up I want to know if that's a word and if so I'll start using it Alexander says Jessie what kara so would you recommend to use with react to Jas I don't think I've used so I have used the materialized carousel with react Jas but I wouldn't recommend doing that because as I said you don't usually want to manipulate the Dom so I'm not sure did I use I wonder now I wonder if there's some sort of carousel that comes with this it doesn't look like it okay yeah I have no recommendations for react carousels because I've I've not used one the proper way at least with with react so sorry about that if anyone else is used to carousel with react that's actually a react component and does things the proper way then please put it in the live chat okay one says I like the master and dead branches scheme you can use tags for releases okay cool oh I'll try my best to remember that and and actually get that going for for the live stream tomorrow Blake asks what do you guys think about Jekyll Alexander thinks Jekyll is awesome Blake says I'm still a noob so should I wait and see how it works and everything yeah I have not used Jekyll before but I've seen videos on it and I think it looks really interesting and cool so Alexander says I'm still a new you can check dev tips channel here on YouTube and see how Jekyll works yeah actually I think I think I've watched the dev tips videos on Jekyll so I like the dev tips channel I think it's Travis does the videos I think he does a really good job and you learn a lot and they're fun to watch too so yeah check that out to learn more about Jekyll 1 says I work with Drupal 8 right now ok cool so I think we were I'd gone back and someone asked about Drupal 8 so once it's working with your boy that's cool we have I'm only if I use a CMS I normally use WordPress but we do have some things built some sites that I don't work on directly but we have some sites you at the University they're a bit with Drupal I've worked with it a little bit in the past yosef says I just wonder how much you get paid for a monthly basis I don't let's see I was about to show you my timesheet on on air but then I thought about it and I I thought I better not just in case like there's some personal information like uh I don't know what's on that screen maybe as my social security number and everything so I'm gonna do it on my other screen now because I don't remember what I make in a month but I will tell you in a few seconds so I'm actually a big proponent of not keeping salary information secret so I think normally that works against employees and it benefits the employers more so I think we would all be better off if salary information were pretty available the only time that it could potentially hurt employees if you're going to get a new job and your employers realize that you don't make that much and so they think they can get away with offering you less other than that situation I think normally it's better so let me go to my on my other screen I'm going to find the information and then I'll let you know all right so every month after they take taxes out and insurance and all that other stuff that get taken out of my paycheck I make about twenty five hundred dollars so I'm not sure if that's a lot or not a lot in my the my area of the United States is pretty economically depressed so that's that's enough for me to pay all my bills and support my wife and four children but in a lot of areas like in big cities that would that would be nothing that that might not even cover rent one says I push to github even if it has errors just in case you never know maybe your laptop burns yeah that is that's another good point Yosef says I really love your live coding because it keeps you motivated well awesome I really appreciate when you all another there have been some other really positive comments today in the live chat I really do appreciate that so I don't get tired of hearing that said because I mean honestly like with the streams I there are good days and bad days there days when things get really well and then there are days when I feel like I've done nothing right so the positive feedback helps me to want to keep going it so I actually really do look forward to the streams right now and everybody's been like 99% of every comment I've gotten has been positive so I don't intend to stop doing these streams anytime soon unless something beyond my control happens and I have to suck Oh a patrick says pure CSS looks good if you want to include just the functionality you need okay that's cool let's see lei Tuan on I'm I'm not he's actually I pronounced that I'm sorry so as you can try to use styled component cool yeah actually I'm Patrick says I did so I did use the styled components in my last project so I actually I liked it I think that's really useful one says yeah we do we call it American football in Spanish okay cool that's what I thought thought it was American football I wonder how it came to be that we called two different sports the same thing I don't I don't understand I don't know the history of how that happened okay Joseph I see just have put in some some CSS to change the active div so cool Thank You J Rex asks what programming language did you use backend so this site for the last project it was one server used JavaScript use node and then for another server we use PHP so the content management system was WordPress on one server running PHP and then the other server was react running no Jazz for this project it's it's going to be reacting nodejs and then I don't think we're even going to use a content management system we'll see I haven't decided for sure what I want to do depending on how much time I have for this I'm like kind of thinking about maybe either trying out one of the content management systems that runs on node or just trying out you know trying to do a database like maybe like MongoDB or something like that just working with it so I'll have to see like how what other projects are coming up and how important they are to get done I might not have time to work with that Emilia's hi Jesse Texas take a lot from you in the US but it is definitely a good salary globally I would say okay cool yeah I know it's it's pretty it's hard to compare you know salaries for our different places actually the best thing I've ever seen for that is called the Big Mac index I don't know if you ever heard about that but it basically just tells you how much it costs to buy a Big Mac from McDonald's all over the world and then like that's that's a the index you know that's the good measure I guess so I mean really like economists actually use that so than that it is kind of hard to compare let's see Alpina of CSS says I really appreciate you doing this could you make isomorphic app tutorial yeah I I mean I've said this a lot and I'm sorry I haven't been able to do it but I really do want to make some tutorials like prerecord them and put them on my channel and I'd like to do a tutorial using react or next j/s which will allow you to very easily make an isomorphic yes or says thank you for your honesty yeah no problem like I said I'm I'm pretty open about salary stuff so and my salary it's not like it's uh I mean there there are people to make doing the same thing I do and make a lot more and I'm sure there are people doing the same thing that I do they make less but I can pay the bills and support my family so that's that's really what matters I mean I'm sure everybody could always say they wish I had more but you know at the end of the day you know I have it I have enough to survive one so and I like what I do Emilia says here in Guatemala average frontend programmer makes you I'm $1,000 for 40 hours a week okay cool that's interesting I know there's a big at least I've read before that there's a big difference and what developers get paid in different countries so like right now in the United States developers get paid a lot compared to other jobs but I've heard that in some countries it's not like that so you know for whatever reason in the United States right now they need more developers so they're willing to pay a higher higher amount alright Joseph said I'm changing a WiFi signup portal from PHP my sequel to react sequel Lite 3 or react that's really cool I'd like to see if that's Joseph if that's a project that could be made available on github that would be really cool to see so send me a link if your your able to put that on github and I would be really interested in seeing it AB I know CSS says you are a really great tutor and I know that this is time consuming time that you can spend with your child but it would be great to get some clarifications in your style yeah yeah like I said I do really want to do some more stuff so you know we'll see how it goes I actually I mean I don't have nearly enough subscribers yet to even think about getting money from YouTube but maybe one day I can justify like doing more video right now it's just hard to justify like go home and say to my wife like hey I'm gonna take a couple of hours and make youtube videos and not get anything out of it but if I could say like you know hey I I could potentially get like ad revenue or something you know then that would be justifiable you know for me to say like it's it's almost like a second job and then then at least I could say you know I'm providing some more money for my family and then it might be more doable for me to produce stuff more regularly but for right now I'm you know that's that's like probably a long long way off if if it ever happens but I will try to make some tutorials when I can CSS is we get $1700 monthly in Croatia for four years a week okay cool that is cool I really I'm really interested in what people get Jarek says are you working as freelance or inhouse or something yeah I work at a university so I'm a fulltime frontend developer for for University and then I do some work on the side like freelance work but I I don't really like to do a lot unless it's a project I'm really interested in or I'll make a lot of money off it because I'm pretty busy so I'd rather not take up more of my time than I need to pop I know CSS says okay you need wife permission in the frowny face in a smiley face yeah I mean like basically because I couldn't if I were to want to take more time to do that that would mean that I wouldn't be able to watch the kids and I would have to ask my wife to watch all four of our kids and then she wouldn't have time to do any of the things that she would like to do you know normally when I get home from work I watched the kids right so otherwise she would have them all day every day with no breaks so that's what I mean when I say I'd have to be able to justify that so if if I went home and said hey wife why don't you why don't you watch the kids for another couple more in a couple of hours you know with no break so I can just go make youtube videos right then then that wouldn't sound as good but if I could say like hey I'm gonna make a bunch of money off of ads on YouTube if I put out you know three or four videos a week then it might make her a little bit more happy and she could have so you see I don't does that make sense that it would just be I don't know if you're married maybe you you understand Mike Scioscia kids like it would be it just seems like to me it's it's a lot easier to make the case for me to do more and in terms of work if the the payoff is greater so anyway okay this before yes I do have four kids yeah so from 8 years old down to 9 months old and I have two girls and two boys all right so I've gotten to the end of the live chat and that's about yeah that's over to our video at this point but if you have any any other questions you know feel free to reach out to me on Twitter okay there's one more question in there Jay rec says how long have you been working as a dev at the University it's been about two years but before that I was freelance for about three years I think so all in all about five years like that I was seriously developer I mean I I did some websites here and there before that but I wouldn't say that I was a serious you know developer until about like five five years ago or so and I really well I wouldn't would not have called myself like a true developer that first year I was really just learning a lot Oh aim highs here yeah sorry you're you're too late we're about to end so you can catch the the recording it'll be available yeah and and give me an update on how the job is going to you can message me on on Twitter or something so I'm interested okay all right so for real this time I'm gonna be done so thank you so much for watching tomorrow the stream is probably gonna be a little bit later maybe around 230 3 o'clock and Friday it's going to be really early so I'll let you know about that time tomorrow and have a great day I'll see you all tomorrow
