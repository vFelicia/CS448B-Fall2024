00:00 - I think that the Cs has kind of been
00:01 - lazy in their curriculum because it
00:03 - doesn't matter what they teach because
00:06 - you know they teach you know 80% of it
00:08 - is a waste and 20% of it is good and
00:10 - then I think you and I could teach the
00:12 - 20% without the 80% and re achieve the
00:14 - same result
00:20 - [Music]
00:42 - welcome back to the freeco camp podcast
00:44 - I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of
00:47 - freeco camp.org each week we're bringing
00:49 - you Insight from developers Founders and
00:51 - ambitious people in Tech this week we
00:54 - are talking to Dr Chuck Dr Charles sance
00:58 - computer science professor
01:00 - at University of Michigan one of the top
01:02 - computer science programs in the world
01:06 - Dr Chuck has created many free learning
01:10 - resources over the years including his
01:14 - python for everyone course extremely
01:16 - popular he's created courses on C
01:18 - programming language D Jango web
01:20 - development framework so many different
01:21 - things and he's made them freely
01:23 - available for Learners we published
01:25 - several courses of his on the freeo camp
01:27 - YouTube channel Dr Chuck it's an honor
01:30 - to have you on the podcast how are you
01:31 - doing
01:32 - today I'm doing great Quincy and it is
01:35 - an honor to be on the podcast you have
01:37 - lots and lots of people and you're so
01:39 - successful to free code camp and and I
01:41 - know I knew you when you were like
01:43 - smaller but you just keep growing and
01:45 - growing you're staff your your
01:47 - viewership and everything and so it's
01:49 - exciting to see see you grow thank you
01:51 - sir uh again like uh I don't want to be
01:54 - overly differential but like you have
01:56 - been a huge inspiration to me over the
01:59 - years and I know to boars and to a lot
02:02 - of the folks on the Freo Camp team who
02:04 - are building these open learning
02:06 - resources uh so I I'm just gonna like we
02:09 - we usually talk about like programmer
02:11 - origin stories and stuff like that but
02:12 - I've got so many things that I want to
02:14 - talk to you about I'm just going to dive
02:15 - right into it uh and we're going to
02:17 - start talking about programming the
02:20 - craft the art the thing that it like
02:24 - most developers do
02:26 - day-to-day what is a master programmer
02:32 - well it is the art and it is the craft
02:35 - the master programmer is my way of
02:37 - emphasizing that programming is not
02:39 - mathematics right programming is a
02:42 - creative thing and um margin story is
02:46 - really simple I mean I am an artist at
02:48 - heart uh I wanted to be in theater I
02:53 - mean I wanted to go to New York City
02:55 - after I graduated from high school my
02:57 - mom said why don't you go be an engineer
02:58 - first and um and so I'm I'm a very
03:03 - creative person right and and I but
03:05 - every time I try to draw art it's
03:07 - terrible because I just don't have high
03:09 - ey coordination or maybe it's not
03:10 - patience and when I'm at computers I'm
03:13 - like I can make a Hangman game and I can
03:17 - just sit at my keyboard as long as I
03:19 - type it right then I got a Hangman game
03:21 - and so the key to it was it was a way of
03:24 - expressing creative artistic Concepts
03:26 - but not requiring like a charcoal pencil
03:29 - to kind of shade everything and
03:32 - so the master the master programmer is
03:37 - the same concept let's just say applied
03:39 - to carpentry I know Master carpenters
03:42 - and you can literally drop a master
03:44 - Carpenter into any situation right you
03:47 - might have like a Stairway that's gotten
03:49 - wet and started to rot and the master
03:51 - compentent looks in goes like okay I've
03:53 - never seen this situation before but
03:54 - it's like a jillion other situations
03:56 - that I looked at before and they all of
03:58 - a sudden creatively are just generating
04:00 - a solution it's carpentry is not just
04:02 - like you know order a bunch of stuff and
04:04 - then go and um you know plug that thing
04:08 - in and make it all happen and so I think
04:11 - of the master programmer in the same way
04:14 - and the master programmer are these
04:16 - people that I know who are you know mid
04:19 - to late career people that can learn
04:22 - anything can do anything you can switch
04:26 - them to from java to react and they
04:28 - they're they're com comfortable in a
04:30 - couple of weeks and so they're just like
04:33 - amazing and you can throw them into any
04:34 - situation and then I I think of sort of
04:38 - the the way a master Carpenter becomes a
04:41 - master Carpenter and I want to imitate
04:44 - that by sort of mentoring by observation
04:48 - by slowly learning more stuff and then
04:50 - applying that stuff and getting really
04:53 - good at things and then eventually you
04:56 - are the master programmer and so
04:59 - the other reason I'm talking about the
05:01 - master programmer is I the one thing
05:04 - that the master programmer is
05:06 - not is a computer science degree I've
05:09 - literally never met a
05:11 - person who graduated with a bachelor's
05:13 - degree in computer science that I would
05:15 - consider even partially a master
05:18 - programmer frankly they're terrible
05:20 - programmers computer science encourages
05:23 - extremely bad programming
05:26 - behavior and that's because they they
05:30 - they tell you to do this assignment and
05:32 - you got a week to do it and then you get
05:34 - it done on time and then you throw it
05:36 - away and then they give you a different
05:38 - thing to do and they give you a week to
05:40 - do it and you throw it away that's not
05:42 - what Master programmers do they come
05:43 - into your house and your stairs have got
05:45 - a rotted part and they're going to leave
05:47 - your house and you're going to have a
05:49 - fixed stairs for the next 20 years and a
05:51 - master programmer is the same way they
05:54 - they can work on software that lives
05:55 - long it's not maybe the most upto-date
05:58 - thing and and and and so I'm I'm kind of
06:01 - like also the enemy of things like lead
06:03 - code I hate lead code because leak code
06:05 - turns such a creative person and I'm not
06:08 - saying computer science students aren't
06:10 - creative and aren't smart and aren't
06:11 - wonderful and aren't talented what I'm
06:14 - saying is they have been taught that
06:15 - lead code is the purpose of their life
06:18 - and that's leak code is like the the
06:20 - Amazon fulfillment center version of you
06:22 - know creativ of artwork right yeah
06:25 - meaning that leite code you are a robot
06:28 - I will stick you in this room I will
06:29 - measure you I'll watch your blood
06:31 - pressure and heart rate and then based
06:33 - on your blood pressure and heart rate
06:35 - and how much how many packages you get
06:36 - done in an hour then I'm going to give
06:38 - you some numeric rating and by the way
06:40 - your your your average which is like oh
06:44 - I can't be average that must be terrible
06:45 - and so leak code computer science take
06:49 - away all the
06:50 - humanity of what it is that we do and if
06:53 - you think for example of what you've
06:56 - done since free code Camp was created
06:59 - it's not mathematical it's it's like you
07:02 - just have to sit and go like what what
07:04 - could we do whoa that's a let's try that
07:08 - right it's so
07:29 - getting things done quickly and moving
07:31 - on to the next thing and like you said
07:33 - like the Amazon Fulfillment of software
07:35 - as opposed to um actually like learning
07:40 - how to do it right and then doing every
07:42 - job right so that it you know it kind of
07:44 - stand to the the rigors of time uh and
07:48 - uh you know not be reclaimed by Nature
07:51 - as so many code bases are the moment
07:53 - that the programmer walks away from them
07:56 - right yeah um yes well
08:00 - you know we're not we are going to talk
08:02 - about computer science programs and and
08:04 - I I think it's oh you're back yeah I'm
08:08 - back sorry okay so um just just a quick
08:11 - uh heads up we're using the uh we're
08:14 - using Riverside to record this and
08:16 - sometimes uh if people disconnect and
08:18 - reconnect uh my apologies to those
08:21 - watching the video version but um yes so
08:25 - uh one of the things that you've been a
08:26 - huge advocate of uh for helping people
08:30 - learn programming is to really encourage
08:32 - people to learn C properly C being
08:36 - probably one of the most primordial
08:38 - programming languages still in use today
08:40 - uh most Things are Written In C it's
08:43 - like when we talk about layers of
08:44 - abstraction they're usually layers of
08:46 - abstraction on top of C somewhere in the
08:49 - the pile of pillows right um why should
08:53 - people study C in 2024
08:59 - the the reason is is that the the best
09:01 - programmers like I said can be dropped
09:04 - into a completely new environment and
09:06 - you give them four weeks and then they
09:08 - probably will be the best at that new
09:09 - environment than other mediocre
09:11 - programmers who've been working in that
09:13 - environment for years and the reason is
09:15 - is that they have a mental model of
09:19 - what's going on inside of computers and
09:21 - so they're like oh we're going to do
09:23 - Rust and react okay rust and react is
09:27 - just another syntax
09:29 - and but the computer is the same and so
09:33 - all they need to do in their four weeks
09:35 - of coming up to speed and rust and react
09:37 - is kind of just glue the rust stuff to
09:39 - all the wonderful structures that are in
09:41 - their brain already and so the problem
09:45 - is is if if we just teach people python
09:49 - they're they're they're going to be
09:51 - capable of doing things but they don't
09:53 - understand what's really happening so if
09:55 - I take someone who's really good in
09:57 - Python and say you're going to go into a
09:59 - rough and react project they're like uh
10:02 - how about we convert your 10-year-old
10:05 - rust and reactor software to python so I
10:08 - understand it like no no no I didn't
10:10 - hire you to tell me to convert my rust
10:13 - program to python where is a a master
10:16 - programmer goes like yeah rust is just
10:19 - another thing I'll figure that out and
10:21 - how is it that a master programmer can
10:24 - go from python to rust and then to Scala
10:26 - and then and Java and whatever and just
10:28 - do that every few months as needed maybe
10:31 - even every few weeks as needed and so
10:34 - what I'm thinking is I'm like how do
10:36 - people get that sort of agility in their
10:39 - mind that nothing is nothing is hard for
10:42 - them nothing scares them anymore and
10:44 - that's where C comes in and that is
10:46 - python is a great place to start right
10:49 - it's kind of a middle level abstraction
10:51 - there's lots of things that build on top
10:52 - of it things that you know you can do in
10:55 - Python and it it brings people into the
10:58 - Technology field than
11:00 - career with the least amount of wasted
11:03 - time I mean you just take a python
11:06 - class a month or two later you you're
11:09 - ready to do some work right you're let
11:10 - ready to learn the problem is is you're
11:12 - not ready to be agile you're not ready
11:15 - to evolve think of like Pokemons right
11:19 - you get this Pokemon and then you want
11:20 - to evolve your evolve your Pokemon well
11:22 - you're a python programmer you want to
11:24 - evolve your Python program and you're
11:25 - not capable of evolving so C learning C
11:29 - and then later learning Hardware even
11:31 - though it's a very gentle introduction
11:33 - to see and a very gentle introduction to
11:35 - Hardware is an investment in later being
11:39 - able to evolve to anything programming
11:42 - language that don't exist UI Frameworks
11:44 - that don't currently exist if there's
11:47 - one thing in Tech it changes all the
11:50 - time and so if you want to be ready for
11:52 - what goes on there is no way you can go
11:54 - to college and learn the 250 different
11:58 - technologies that are being used used in
11:59 - the industry today you got to learn each
12:01 - of those when the time comes so what can
12:03 - I teach you I can teach you C you know
12:06 - that's 1978 so that's like 50 years old
12:11 - and 40 years old whatever it's old and
12:15 - uh if I teach you C then I can give you
12:17 - the tools that let you learn a new thing
12:22 - every few weeks and master that new
12:24 - thing not just like oh okay I printed
12:26 - hello world and C then I printed hello
12:28 - world Rost I put it hello world in react
12:30 - no no no no no you got to go in and
12:32 - maintain a large application in Rust and
12:34 - react and and see is the key to that and
12:37 - because I can't just teach you rust and
12:38 - I can't teach you schola and I can't
12:40 - teach you all the hundreds of things
12:42 - that you're going to encounter in the
12:43 - real world but I can teach you see and I
12:46 - want you to really understand it and
12:48 - that way you've got a mental model of
12:50 - how computers work and that's why
12:51 - Hardware is important too so the next
12:53 - class I'm going to uh create after the
12:55 - cclass is a hardware class but it'll be
12:57 - like everything I do it'll be gentle and
13:00 - fun it'll take you a little while and
13:01 - you walk away with this solid knowledge
13:03 - in the back of your mind that you keep
13:05 - forever and then you can apply it to any
13:07 - new situation that you you run
13:10 - into awesome and is that of course going
13:13 - to also be in the uh for everybody like
13:17 - line you you got absolutely you got C I
13:19 - think you got C for everybody you've got
13:21 - python for everybody Django for
13:23 - everybody uh you may not know this but
13:25 - Kylie Ying uh she's a software engineer
13:28 - at Google and she also works at fre Cod
13:31 - camp and she creates courses for us and
13:33 - a few years ago I reached out and I said
13:35 - hey could we do uh a course called
13:37 - machine learning for everybody and like
13:39 - have it be a spiritual successor to your
13:42 - uh you know python for everybody because
13:44 - you know it's uses Python and that
13:46 - course has like five million views on
13:49 - YouTube that's it's like one of the most
13:50 - popular machine learning courses of all
13:52 - time and it's very much in the vein of
13:55 - the work that you've already done uh
13:57 - thank you for giving us permission to
13:59 - kind of use that that title
14:02 - structure it's an honor and I'm glad
14:05 - that someone other than me is doing AI
14:06 - for everybody because I I don't I I find
14:09 - AI too difficult right I'm trying to
14:12 - create people who can drop into Ai and
14:14 - figure it all out but I don't want to
14:16 - figure it out myself right and so part
14:18 - of with the whole for everybody thing is
14:20 - I gotta think very deeply about every
14:23 - second of every course so that I don't
14:27 - inadvertently make it more difficult
14:28 - than it needs to be so for her to do AI
14:31 - for everybody thumbs up awesome yeah
14:35 - well I am very excited to talk about AI
14:39 - um I but this Hardware thing uh I I
14:43 - really want to talk about this because
14:45 - uh a lot of people don't appreciate how
14:48 - networks work how operating systems work
14:50 - how things get written to memory uh all
14:53 - these different uh Concepts that you
14:55 - learn if you get like a a traditional
14:57 - Computer Engineering degree which not
14:59 - very many people get anymore because
15:00 - it's the computer science degrees that
15:02 - the employers are looking for right uh
15:04 - maybe you could talk a little bit about
15:06 - what you think if if you could just
15:07 - almost kind of list like a table of
15:09 - contents of what your course is
15:11 - ultimately likely to contain that would
15:13 - be really cool just kind of like
15:15 - information people can put in their back
15:17 - pocket so they can be looking out for
15:18 - those things when they're sifting around
15:20 - for courses on YouTube or if they're
15:22 - like at the library like trying to check
15:24 - out some books to like backfill their
15:26 - knowledge and understanding of these
15:28 - things
15:31 - absolutely let me I'll get to the table
15:33 - of contents because that's pretty easy
15:35 - um let me talk about my own education
15:38 - and where I encountered hardware and how
15:40 - it affected me um so you know I'm in the
15:44 - middle of a computer science degree chug
15:46 - chug chug chug chug and then I I take a
15:48 - hardware class right and
15:52 - um
15:53 - I I all of a sudden sort of get this
15:57 - situation where I'm completely obsessed
15:59 - with like chip layout and in chip layout
16:02 - it's very artistic and it's pretty and
16:04 - there's colors and it's like red and
16:05 - blue and and black and on this
16:08 - background and you're drawing these
16:09 - little traces to make chips or to make
16:12 - boards you draw traces and it's like
16:14 - this is so visual and so in this class
16:17 - we were laying out some and Gates and or
16:20 - Gates and flipflops using painting
16:23 - basically because you paint various
16:25 - materials then you make masks and they
16:27 - put those materials down and then you
16:28 - make chips out of that and I saw that
16:33 - and I had this project and I sat down at
16:35 - a computer back then it was a sun
16:38 - workstation and I literally didn't get
16:40 - up from that computer for 48 hours I was
16:43 - so like it's like Gamers right I just 48
16:46 - Hours laying out chips learning the
16:49 - software this is the greatest thing
16:52 - ever and then I finished the class and I
16:54 - never took another Hardware class again
16:56 - right because I didn't need to know
16:59 - how to do that professionally but the
17:02 - the sense of what a professional
17:04 - Hardware Builder does is been very
17:07 - precious to me and I loved the kind of
17:10 - quick brief interlude into how that
17:14 - works and and again I I have no interest
17:17 - in building Hardware none whatsoever I
17:19 - like software and so uh hardware for
17:23 - everybody is just the right
17:27 - sampling and so uh the the key thing in
17:30 - hardware for everybody or computer
17:32 - architecture for everybody is what I
17:33 - call it um first we're going to start
17:35 - with
17:37 - transistors and then we're going to
17:39 - build a notot gate and then we're going
17:41 - to build a nand gate and then we're
17:44 - going to you know build a couple other
17:46 - Gates out of
17:47 - transistors and then we will build a
17:49 - flip-flop out of transistors and then
17:52 - we'll start playing with things like
17:54 - flip-flops and and Gates and or Gates
17:55 - and we'll make a half adder then we'll
17:58 - make a full adder
18:00 - um then we'll you know do a ripple carry
18:02 - add for like four bits and then we will
18:05 - stop on the hardware on the lowlevel
18:08 - like circuitry ones and zeros going
18:11 - through traces and wires and turning
18:13 - lights on and turning lights off that's
18:15 - enough that that's enough and then what
18:17 - we're going to do is we're going to
18:19 - start looking at machine language and
18:22 - that is how programs can be written with
18:27 - zeros and ones I mean what it does it
18:29 - mean it's all full of zeros and ones
18:31 - well it's not really zeros and ones it's
18:32 - little electric traces that are the
18:34 - little little electric pulses that are
18:36 - moving down wires that's what's going on
18:39 - and so but some at some point it goes
18:42 - from gates to instructions so I will
18:45 - have a machine language which is you
18:47 - program a you will write code with zeros
18:50 - and ones and I will teach you machine
18:52 - language then I'll teach you Assembly
18:54 - Language which is nothing more than a
18:56 - direct translation to those zero zero
18:58 - and ones each line of an assembling
19:01 - language program trans directly
19:02 - translates directly to a series of zeros
19:07 - and ones and so we'll write a machine
19:11 - language we'll write in Assembly
19:13 - Language we'll even write a simple
19:16 - assembler
19:18 - and and that's pretty much well we will
19:21 - do one little thing where we will run
19:22 - the C compiler and look at the assembler
19:24 - output of a c compiler so we understand
19:27 - how compilers create assembly language
19:29 - and then how that Assembly Language
19:30 - turns into machine code and how that
19:32 - machine code runs uh on computers and so
19:37 - everything that I ever do and we're not
19:39 - very good at making all my autog graders
19:42 - work well on free code Camp everyone has
19:44 - to come to my site like CC free.com and
19:47 - do the auto GD which is okay free code
19:49 - Camp is kind of the video part of it and
19:51 - my websites are free and they are the
19:53 - the autog grader part of it but the
19:55 - hardest part for the computer
19:57 - architecture for everybody is going to
19:58 - be the Auto graders cuz I'm going to
19:59 - build a chip layout system cuz I can't
20:03 - find one free that's kind of me right I
20:05 - mean there are products out there but I
20:08 - think they're a too hard and B they're
20:10 - they want to make money off this stuff
20:12 - they should just give me a free one but
20:14 - they're not going to give me a free one
20:15 - so I have got to build an in browser
20:18 - JavaScript based chip layout system
20:22 - where I can give an assignment to lay
20:23 - out a chip or lay out a circuit in the
20:26 - browser and then I can put probe points
20:29 - on that chip and then I can autograde
20:31 - the fact that you have actually built a
20:33 - half adder so I got to I got to build
20:35 - all that technology and when I build
20:37 - courses autog graders come first I just
20:40 - the assignments need to scale and the
20:42 - assignments are where the actual
20:44 - Learning Happens not just the me talking
20:47 - um and so that's the basic outline right
20:51 - transistors
20:53 - Gates kind of small circuits made up of
20:55 - gates machine language assembler
20:59 - compiler to
21:00 - assembler it'll be shorter than most of
21:02 - my courses that I
21:04 - teach awesome I just want to say on the
21:06 - note of the autog grader we're
21:08 - developing our own uh Auto graders
21:09 - around like networks and uh chips and
21:12 - like systems on chips like there's only
21:14 - so much you can really simulate in like
21:16 - a browser uh and accurately test but uh
21:19 - we're working with a software engineer
21:21 - who also has like a hardware background
21:23 - and we're we're developing kind of our
21:25 - own autog graders for those sorts of
21:27 - things so we may be able to collaborate
21:28 - on that and make it open source I mean
21:30 - you got to you got to find a way to get
21:32 - learning tools interoperability to your
21:33 - infrastructure so that anybody can write
21:35 - an auto grader in any topic and plug it
21:37 - into your your system that's the key you
21:40 - you and com Academy build a complete
21:43 - custom system and corsera that's all
21:47 - just blobbed into one thing for every
21:49 - course but if you use learning tools
21:50 - interoperability then you can kind of
21:52 - have a nice bright boundary point where
21:55 - autog grads live out there and the core
21:57 - system that you're doing grading and
21:59 - tracking that lives in here but yeah and
22:01 - one of these days you're still netlify
22:04 - right so we were using netlify we may be
22:07 - using it for some things uh we just uh I
22:10 - mean we have like hund like more than
22:12 - aund servers around the world uh so
22:15 - people in Singapore uh like we have a
22:17 - Singapore server so people in East Asia
22:19 - we've got like Latin American servers so
22:21 - everybody has like a low ping and um and
22:24 - we do have autog graders for JavaScript
22:26 - we have autog graders uh for or a lot of
22:29 - them just run inside a Google
22:30 - collaboratory for like the machine
22:31 - learning related tasks um and then we
22:34 - have uh autog graders for python but uh
22:37 - and we we'd like to build like a more
22:39 - generic like Auto grader where people
22:41 - could essentially have this library that
22:43 - they could include um so that is like a
22:46 - long-term goal of ours uh but like
22:49 - pretty much everything we design in
22:51 - terms of interactive design Interactive
22:53 - Learning we start from the premise of
22:55 - like how can we test this program
22:58 - atically so that they don't have to
22:59 - submit something and wait for a human to
23:01 - review it so that we can keep this like
23:03 - abut millisecond length feedback loop so
23:05 - people can rapidly iterate and yeah it's
23:09 - like a game you're you're at a boss
23:11 - right you're just you're just struggling
23:12 - with it you're figuring it out that's
23:14 - the moment of learning right and if we
23:16 - can make something that does not require
23:18 - the delay of a human being involved that
23:21 - means it's more like playing a video
23:22 - game where you can you got an hour and
23:25 - you struggle and you learn and you
23:27 - struggle and you learn and you and then
23:29 - you're you break through and then you're
23:30 - like oh and you didn't have to wait and
23:33 - so that's what why autog graders are
23:35 - always for me the most important part
23:37 - because then I like I make autog graders
23:40 - then I create assignments in the autog
23:41 - graders and then I make sure that I have
23:42 - a lecture that supports the learning
23:45 - objectives of what I'm going to assign
23:47 - as homework right and so it's a
23:51 - assessments are important and they're
23:52 - the most they're the most intricate to
23:55 - me part of of anything and now now
23:58 - you're probably building a much more
23:59 - sophisticated Hardware environment than
24:02 - I am because my circuit layout the hard
24:06 - the most difficult thing it needs to
24:08 - build is a 4bit ripple carry Adder which
24:11 - really tiny compared to like a chip or
24:14 - anything like that and this is where I'd
24:16 - let the if you're going to be a
24:17 - professional Hardware designer go go go
24:19 - to get a bachelor's degree in electrical
24:21 - engineering or computer engineering
24:23 - that's fine but I don't I think for
24:25 - everybody we just need to know enough to
24:27 - believe that we could figure out if we
24:28 - had
24:29 - to yeah I'm I'm right there with you
24:32 - like and one of the things that you've
24:34 - advocated for over the years is learning
24:37 - fewer things but learning them more
24:40 - deeply um and and retaining them and
24:43 - retaining them can you talk about like
24:45 - let's say somebody's like a first year
24:47 - computer science or maybe they're a
24:48 - fourth year and they're about to
24:49 - graduate and they have to make up for
24:51 - just kind of coasting along and doing
24:53 - what their teachers have been saying um
24:55 - and they need they need to backfill and
24:57 - they need to to fill in this knowledge
24:58 - or uh like about a third of the people
25:00 - in the free cam Community are career
25:03 - Changers who are coming from completely
25:04 - different fields maybe accounting maybe
25:06 - driving a truck uh maybe doing any
25:08 - number of uh different jobs that have
25:11 - various levels of technical proficiency
25:13 - associated with them or basically not
25:15 - not even using a computer as part of
25:16 - their job right um what advice would you
25:19 - have as far as the few things that they
25:22 - should focus on learning deeply if you
25:25 - just had to Rattle off a list
25:29 - well I think that uh python
25:32 - C like any web framework I pick Django
25:37 - um I mean everything is going to have
25:38 - the web there should be some API stuff
25:40 - in there and I look at like what are the
25:44 - four or five courses that you need in
25:46 - order to learn everything else and I've
25:48 - got this talk I I give and I gave it in
25:52 - India back in February to a bunch of
25:53 - schools and the idea was is I took all
25:56 - the things that you might encounter in
25:58 - the real world at work and I'm like okay
26:01 - among all these topics which of them
26:03 - fall below the line which means that we
26:05 - should teach everybody these topics and
26:08 - um I came up with four
26:10 - topics um and then three more topics and
26:14 - then I called that the path to the
26:15 - master programmer and that is what are
26:18 - what in effect in
26:21 - 2024 is a computer science degree
26:26 - equivalent because computer science
26:27 - degrees designed in 1978 when it was
26:30 - actually difficult and so yeah it took
26:32 - four years and that's the problem is is
26:34 - that they just make it harder but it
26:36 - they don't they don't they don't teach
26:38 - more essential things and so for me I
26:40 - want to cut it down to the essentials so
26:41 - that a person who's switching from a
26:44 - truck driving job to a programming job
26:46 - can do so in less than a
26:48 - year and so the path and master
26:50 - programmer is python see D Jango which
26:54 - is really more about web object
26:56 - orientation is a real important learning
26:57 - objective that I don't think has done
26:58 - well in computer science at all um
27:03 - Hardware
27:06 - JavaScript
27:08 - Java and then an internship in open
27:10 - source and then I going to take that
27:13 - truck driver and
27:14 - say you can go to work and the first
27:18 - thing that they're going to learn when
27:19 - they go to work is potentially none of
27:21 - those things that I just taught
27:23 - them because they'll probably react in
27:26 - scholar or some crazy thing like that
27:28 - but they'll figure it out and so that's
27:29 - the that is my distilling of the essence
27:33 - of a computer science degree into in
27:35 - effect seven three credit college
27:38 - courses now my secret hidden
27:41 - agenda is the time we should teach these
27:44 - seven
27:46 - courses is between the age of 14 uh 13
27:50 - and
27:52 - 16 because people who are 15 years old
27:56 - their minds are like a vacuum cleaner CU
28:00 - if you want
28:02 - retention teach somebody something when
28:04 - they're 14 15 or 16 years
28:06 - old and the the way I teach courses is
28:10 - they're ready for high school and I got
28:12 - a friend who's a high school teacher and
28:14 - he keeps testing this and you'd be
28:16 - amazed at how brilliant they are
28:18 - graduating from high school and so
28:19 - imagine if we could take 25% of the
28:22 - people graduating from high school and
28:23 - give them what I consider to be the
28:26 - equivalent of computer science
28:28 - bachelor's light which is what the
28:30 - master programmer
28:32 - is how would the world change if a
28:37 - person could make 40 50 or $60,000 as a
28:41 - software
28:42 - developer graduating at 17 years old
28:44 - from high school what would their next
28:47 - education look like when they don't have
28:50 - to go get a computer science education
28:52 - when we taught it to him in high school
28:54 - and I mean I think that's a fun thing to
28:56 - think about and I'll
28:58 - you know the future looks like the past
29:00 - just later and that is wouldn't it be
29:03 - amazing
29:05 - if our children in 10 years were could
29:09 - make 60,000 bucks a year out of high
29:12 - school and then when we went to college
29:14 - they could take a really cool liberal
29:15 - arts degree I mean they're already
29:17 - professional
29:19 - programmers and then they go on liberal
29:21 - arts degree and they're like yeah I know
29:22 - how to program and then I want to be a
29:24 - lawyer or I want to be an economist oh
29:27 - and by the way
29:28 - coming along with me is professional
29:31 - programmer skills so every person who
29:34 - goes in the Congress every person who
29:38 - drives a train every person who drives a
29:41 - truck is already a software developer
29:44 - right yeah and I mean that's that's why
29:47 - the for everybody is for everybody it's
29:49 - really for high school students that you
29:50 - know but but I don't think anyone would
29:53 - take a class called python for high
29:54 - school students but that's really what I
29:56 - am building
29:59 - that's cool I had no idea that that was
30:01 - like like I didn't really think that
30:03 - much about the the name because like
30:06 - free C Camp like a vast majority of
30:08 - people who use free C Camp are in their
30:10 - 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s um we even have some
30:13 - people in their 70s and 80s doing it but
30:16 - like the median learner age is like 30
30:18 - so these are people who've already
30:20 - gotten out of college and studied some
30:23 - field that like is difficult to pay off
30:25 - their student debt with a lot of times
30:28 - uh like I I studied liberal arts and I I
30:30 - definitely will uh stand for Liberal
30:33 - Arts like I uh like I think like a more
30:36 - than a quarter of liberal of like
30:38 - Fortune 500 CEOs and stuff are like
30:41 - liberal arts Majors it's one of the more
30:43 - common things and obviously it's a great
30:45 - Pathway to to working in uh law uh and
30:49 - ultimately in work working in any kind
30:51 - of creative field I think but at the
30:53 - same
30:55 - time it's not immediately clear what you
30:57 - do with a LS degree when you graduate
31:00 - most people just go to graduate school
31:02 - which is what I did um and I think the
31:05 - notion that like if people already had
31:08 - some skill that they could go and sell
31:10 - on the market and then they could decide
31:11 - what to do and they could pursue an
31:13 - actual field that they're interested in
31:15 - instead of just going into one of the
31:18 - you know highest like they look at like
31:19 - us news and World Report what are the
31:21 - highest paid majors and then they they
31:23 - basically make decisions around that
31:24 - because everything is about covering
31:26 - your initial cost and and potentially
31:28 - especially if you're coming from
31:29 - overseas and you're flying to the United
31:31 - States and you're getting like a student
31:33 - visa and all that stuff how in the world
31:35 - am I gon to make this worth it because
31:37 - my like two generations saved up money
31:39 - to be able to eventually send me to the
31:41 - US to get a degree right so so people
31:44 - basically have this economic
31:45 - imperative you have no idea how bad that
31:48 - is getting and the United States high
31:51 - red economy is driven by U student visas
31:55 - and uh they're not the deal that they
31:57 - want were we we can uh we can talk about
32:00 - that if you like it's kind of scary
32:02 - let's just talk about it now this is a
32:05 - field near and dear to something else
32:06 - you said in that you there was something
32:08 - oh the liberal arts okay let me say one
32:10 - thing and then we'll talk about
32:11 - International students let's talk about
32:13 - let's talk about liberal arts first
32:15 - think about this you went through that
32:17 - whole liberal arts thing think about
32:20 - this you come out of college as a
32:23 - professional programmer and now you're
32:25 - going to a liberal Art School but you
32:28 - need some spending money do you spend
32:30 - the next four years while you're taking
32:32 - cool Li large classes making coffee or
32:35 - flipping burgers or standing at a
32:37 - McDonald's
32:39 - drive-thru or do you work as a remote
32:41 - worker part-time 20 hours a week riding
32:44 - software for companies and making
32:46 - instead of minimum wage you're making 20
32:50 - hours a week you're making $30,000 a
32:52 - year cash and you're learning like crazy
32:55 - at the same time as you're teaching
32:57 - taking classes like comparative
32:59 - Shakespearean literature which is fun as
33:02 - heck when you're 22 years old right yeah
33:04 - and so think of not just the time you're
33:07 - in class in the liberal arts but think
33:09 - of what you're doing to make money while
33:11 - you're in the liberal arts degree you're
33:13 - learning on the job to become even
33:15 - better software Developers for that four
33:18 - years that you're in Liberal Arts
33:19 - because you're not working as a barista
33:21 - I'm saying but it doesn't mean you can't
33:23 - work as a barista it just means that you
33:25 - don't have to work as a barista you'd be
33:26 - surprised
33:29 - I'm from the University of Michigan
33:30 - right it's the Ivory Tower everybody at
33:33 - the University of Michigan is insanely
33:35 - wealthy and they have like you know
33:37 - drivers to take them to class wrong
33:41 - people at the University of Michigan in
33:42 - the undergrad when we post an
33:45 - undergraduate position at the University
33:47 - of Michigan people line up out the door
33:49 - and that's because some of the students
33:51 - undergrads are wealthy from the east
33:53 - coast and some are not and we have to
33:56 - educate everybody we can't just say well
33:59 - we're a we're a Midwest ivy league like
34:02 - school and so we're going to only wait
34:03 - until rich people show up and the answer
34:06 - is no we have lots of non-rich people
34:08 - and I think about if those students at
34:11 - the University of Michigan could be
34:14 - making good money because they really
34:16 - need survival money I'm not talking
34:18 - about International students now I'm
34:19 - talking about you know students from the
34:21 - state of Michigan going to the
34:22 - University of Michigan to get the best
34:25 - education you can get in that state they
34:27 - can't afford to eat they're hungry and
34:30 - we we don't we just assume that
34:32 - everybody at Princeton or Michigan or
34:35 - whatever can afford to eat and it's not
34:37 - a good
34:38 - assumption so that's why I want people
34:42 - to have employable skills before they
34:43 - come to college so they have the freedom
34:46 - to take a place like the University of
34:48 - Michigan or Princeton and see some
34:51 - really weird course about International
34:53 - economy and say you know what I want to
34:55 - take five more courses about
34:56 - International economy and I can because
34:58 - I'm making a decent living I mean I went
35:01 - to
35:02 - college making a living because I worked
35:04 - at the University full-time so I had
35:06 - benefits I had money I had an apartment
35:08 - I had a family and I was going to school
35:10 - for a long time but it was so fun to go
35:12 - to school and not have to work at a
35:15 - coffee shop 20 hours a week at 2 o'clock
35:18 - in the morning taken away from my
35:20 - education okay
35:22 - yeah so let's talk about International
35:24 - students
35:26 - so the problem with higher education
35:29 - right now and and and everyone like
35:34 - since 1990 has basically said that
35:36 - higher education is is running towards a
35:39 - brick wall something bad's going to
35:42 - happen and I'm like that's not right
35:45 - that's not right that's not right that's
35:46 - not right and most of the things that
35:49 - they're saying is like well if you can
35:51 - learn something on YouTube therefore you
35:53 - don't need to go to school but what
35:55 - people don't quite understand is the
35:57 - purpose of an undergraduate education is
35:59 - not to learn anything but it's to grow
36:01 - up and become an awesome person and and
36:03 - learn to meet people your high school
36:06 - and your family are all kind of
36:08 - homogeneous and when you go to college
36:10 - it's people all over the world and you
36:12 - learn so many things when you first go
36:14 - to college and meet so many people that
36:16 - prepares you for the world that's not
36:18 - exactly the same as the high school that
36:20 - you went to yeah right and so it's
36:23 - important in high school to kind of not
36:25 - overc confuse our our young people
36:27 - people let them learn math and algebra
36:30 - and Python and hardware and C just focus
36:33 - in that little world and then their
36:37 - their minds expand and and and so the
36:40 - the key to a undergraduate education is
36:44 - mostly to grow up but then we talk about
36:47 - graduate education and graduate
36:49 - education is where we have a lot of uh
36:52 - foreign students and they're it's very
36:54 - lucrative you mentioned people save up
36:57 - for two generations to send one child to
37:00 - America so that they can get US
37:03 - citizenship through an H1B and their
37:06 - great grandchildren or
37:07 - great-grandchildren can be US citizens
37:09 - and it's a beautiful story right the
37:12 - problem is that with the last two years
37:15 - of turndown in the tech economy and we
37:17 - can talk a bit about the turndown in
37:18 - Tech economy if you like why I think
37:21 - that is but with the turn down in Tech
37:24 - economy our graduate students who are
37:26 - not US citizens are are encountering uh
37:29 - job posting after job posting after job
37:31 - posting that in not so many words says
37:34 - foreign people need not
37:37 - apply have you heard
37:39 - that I know some people that have been
37:42 - going through the H1B struggle uh I know
37:44 - people that have been almost like kind
37:46 - of forced out of their employers just
37:48 - because like that it's cheaper to hire
37:51 - because it cost it the employer has to
37:55 - support you in your H1B effort and that
37:57 - cost money money and when you have a
37:59 - whole bunch of US citizens just walking
38:00 - around unemployed with lots of skills
38:02 - not bad
38:03 - people why bother going through the H1B
38:07 - fuss if you don't have to so these
38:10 - companies slowly but surely want HR
38:13 - decision at a Time start taking H1B off
38:16 - the
38:18 - table and as long as they take H1B off
38:21 - the table and they get away with it and
38:23 - there's enough people in the economy and
38:25 - enough you know citizens can be hired
38:28 - you pretty much make it so that it's
38:32 - really difficult for a
38:34 - non-citizen to get a job and then get
38:37 - H1B and then become a citizen so that
38:39 - their children can be US citizens which
38:42 - is what two generations in their home
38:44 - country went through yeah the
38:46 - beneficiary of up until two years ago of
38:49 - that was places like the University of
38:50 - Michigan that can command a high premium
38:54 - but really what we're selling is
38:56 - h-1bs right
38:58 - the students that come to us are super
38:59 - talented already they have a whole
39:01 - bachelor's degree in computer science
39:03 - and they're super talented we throw a
39:05 - couple years of master's degree charge
39:06 - them outstate tuition and then you know
39:09 - dump them off into the H1B process and
39:11 - then you know that if you after you
39:13 - graduate if you don't have a job within
39:16 - 60 days you literally have to get on a
39:18 - plane and go
39:19 - home back to that family that save two
39:21 - generations to get you here it is not
39:24 - going to take long at all for for people
39:28 - to realize that that's becoming a very
39:30 - bad
39:31 - investment right I'm saying the quiet
39:33 - part out loud right and so the question
39:37 - becomes the United States has benefited
39:40 - greatly from all these brilliant people
39:42 - coming here and making their whole life
39:44 - sacrifice to be here and to help us and
39:47 - to make our economy better and make us
39:49 - the most creative and productive tech
39:50 - place in the world but if we're going to
39:53 - shut them off at the
39:55 - border things are going to change and
39:57 - universities Revenue are going to I mean
39:59 - I'm talking now about top ones you know
40:01 - the michigans the
40:03 - Harvard's it's not it's if if the
40:06 - international student population stops
40:08 - coming it's not like we can't fill up
40:10 - and do instate master's degrees we'll
40:12 - always have people it's just a massive
40:15 - amount of Revenue that we make from that
40:18 - will go away and honestly that's the to
40:20 - me as a higher ed person that to me is
40:23 - the quiet part out loud about the danger
40:25 - of the next 10 years and you might well
40:30 - guas that I also have a solution to
40:33 - that yeah well let's hear let's let's
40:35 - hear your prop think
40:37 - about well my proposed solution is um is
40:41 - we've got to start
40:43 - creating uh education high quality
40:47 - education that can be delivered online
40:50 - at scale to all corners of the
40:54 - world at a reasonable cost
40:57 - so let's just say at the University of
40:59 - Michigan and by the way I'm just making
41:01 - this up no one's agreed to this yet we
41:04 - make a master programmer certificate and
41:07 - instead of costing
41:09 - $35,000 it costs
41:11 - 3,000 and instead of 300 students we
41:15 - have 10,000 students but you don't have
41:18 - to come to United States and at the end
41:20 - of this not only are you programmer but
41:22 - we have an internship we we hook you up
41:24 - with jobs we hook you up with open
41:27 - source
41:28 - um and I can educate let's just say 6 to
41:33 - 8,000 people every year sitting in my
41:36 - comfy Ann Arbor going to my favorite
41:38 - restaurants and they don't have to come
41:40 - to the United States and they don't need
41:42 - two generations of savings to get here
41:45 - and we can still make money on that
41:47 - right we can still make money on that
41:51 - now here's the
41:54 - problem I have been in educational
41:56 - technology software for last 25 years
41:59 - and I will just say that all the
42:01 - software that's ever been built in
42:03 - educational technology is not suitable
42:06 - to achieve what I just
42:08 - described corera software is bad edx is
42:11 - bad Saka is bad moodle's bad canvas is
42:14 - bad I'm going to guess if I look closely
42:16 - at your stuff it's bad meaning it's just
42:18 - kind of like hacked up to face the
42:20 - moment and I think that in order to
42:23 - build this the first thing we got to do
42:24 - is build really really good education
42:27 - technology software I mean stuff that
42:29 - that is Eclipse is what Corsair is
42:31 - trying to do and eclipse is what edex is
42:33 - trying to do and eclipse what canvas is
42:35 - trying to do even these are all billion
42:37 - dollar companies right but they don't
42:38 - care because they're making a billion
42:40 - dollars they don't want to make a better
42:41 - piece of software they just want to keep
42:44 - selling the same crappy software that
42:46 - they've been
42:47 - selling so that's my solution and my
42:51 - solution prere requires building an
42:54 - entire new generation of educational
42:57 - technology that has not been seen on
42:59 - this planet
43:01 - yet and you think 30 years later from
43:05 - the mid 90s to today they've been
43:06 - building these things called Learning
43:08 - Management Systems you'd think they'
43:10 - have made some
43:11 - progress they made progress making
43:14 - money that's one way to put it uh
43:17 - ruining people they made progress making
43:19 - money and ruining people's
43:22 - privacy stealing their
43:24 - data don't get me started on privacy
43:28 - okay well I won't get you started on
43:30 - privacy cuz uh there's already so much
43:33 - to unpack there uh like obviously we
43:35 - feel very strongly about privacy I'm
43:38 - very proud to say if you go to free Cod
43:40 - Camp SL settings you scroll to the
43:42 - bottom you can delete your account and
43:44 - all data we have on you permanently
43:46 - there's no way back like we literally
43:48 - just delete it and there's a backup that
43:51 - will get deleted after like a week right
43:54 - so like there's no path to reclaiming
43:56 - your data uh and we we make it trivial
43:59 - there's like one are you sure yes it's
44:01 - done um and the other thing you could uh
44:05 - you could add a add a thing to that
44:06 - where you say look I want you to Auto
44:09 - delete my data after two years
44:12 - yeah and so there's this kind of like
44:14 - rolling thing like and if I'm gone two
44:17 - years it's just all gone right and I
44:20 - make it so I can extend it if I want
44:21 - right you send me a note to say hey it's
44:23 - uh it's June we're doing our annual dat
44:27 - a clean up I'm going to clean your data
44:29 - up unless you come and click this button
44:31 - to extend it another another year the
44:34 - button I can extend which means that
44:37 - it's like a dead man switch on a train
44:39 - right where it and I stole this from
44:42 - python anywhere by the way they give a
44:44 - thing say your site's going away but all
44:46 - you gotta do is click this button and
44:47 - you got another three months right and
44:50 - um and so a privacy perspective the key
44:52 - thing is auto expiring data right it's
44:55 - not just getting rid of it which I like
44:57 - that and that's good for furpa and good
44:59 - for all the Privacy standards but Auto
45:01 - expiring data and and the key to Auto
45:03 - expiring data not that free code
45:06 - Camp uh is subject to this but a
45:10 - commercial company should also Auto
45:12 - expire data because that commercial
45:14 - company could be sold 10 years from now
45:17 - so if I use some commercial company to
45:21 - do homework and I upload my stuff to
45:23 - this and my teacher grades it on this
45:25 - uploaded thing yeah um and that company
45:28 - 10 years later gets sold to say a
45:30 - Chinese company and they didn't Auto
45:33 - expire my data but I long ago forgot
45:35 - about it and I really don't care if it
45:37 - exists or not and then my homework is in
45:39 - China right not good not good and so
45:42 - that's where we got to learn Auto expire
45:44 - data so I zoom at the University of
45:47 - Michigan we've got to configured to Auto
45:49 - expire data after like 18 months or
45:51 - something and I'm always getting like
45:53 - emails from Zoom saying we're about to
45:55 - delete your data from from 18 months ago
45:58 - and I'm like I'm so happy when I see
46:00 - that email like yes that's what I want
46:03 - just I don't whatever that was I don't
46:05 - care about it I mean it was important 18
46:06 - months ago I was like a office hours or
46:09 - a lecture or something but it's 18
46:11 - months old actively delete my stuff yeah
46:15 - yeah for us like because people rely on
46:17 - these certifications that we put like
46:19 - and we track like all the work that
46:20 - they've done and we want to be able to
46:21 - have like a forensic chain of like in
46:23 - case there's ever academic dishonesty
46:25 - accusations or something like that yep
46:28 - uh but but this is definitely something
46:30 - that I'm thinking like you got my wheels
46:31 - turning I hadn't even really thought
46:32 - about that I think like from to extend
46:36 - and if they want to keep it for 20 years
46:38 - keep it for 20 years I mean so many of
46:40 - our emails end up in Gmail spam box
46:43 - anyway that I am kind of worried that a
46:45 - lot of people would be like I never got
46:46 - the email and all my data is gone and
46:47 - then we'd be spending a whole lot of
46:48 - support time trying to explain to people
46:50 - sorry we really can't get your data back
46:52 - like I'm sorry this went to spam uh like
46:54 - with my email newsletter I just C my EMA
46:57 - newsletter from 7 million people down to
46:59 - you know less than 100 thousand people
47:02 - and the way I did that was I sent out an
47:03 - email and said hey if you're enjoying
47:05 - this email and you want to keep getting
47:06 - it please click like fill out this form
47:09 - real quick like it's like just confirm
47:11 - basically uh and uh and yeah like a
47:15 - whole lot of people were probably it was
47:17 - showing up in their spam box or they
47:18 - were just like you know filtering it out
47:20 - oh I get to this someday maybe you know
47:22 - but um but the result is fewer people
47:25 - are getting the email but it's the
47:26 - people who really want it so I do like
47:27 - this this notion uh there's so many
47:29 - things we could talk about about privacy
47:31 - like again like I'm a huge believer in
47:34 - respecting people's privacy and asking
47:35 - for the bare minimum information all you
47:37 - need for a free Camp account is like
47:39 - literally an email it can be a fake
47:42 - email we're not going to stop you from
47:43 - using five minute mail or whatever but
47:44 - you're not going to be able to off after
47:47 - that because we don't use passwords
47:48 - because passwords are a huge security
47:50 - thing so we we do like basically we use
47:53 - uh onetime pins to get into your account
47:55 - for example so so like we're thinking
47:57 - about all these things but I I want to
47:59 - get back to what you said because I
48:01 - think it's worth noting like a lot of
48:02 - people may not know what Sakai is but
48:04 - you mentioned you you mentioned like you
48:06 - know Sakai is probably not like good
48:08 - enough uh you know of course there are
48:10 - all these other companies and you
48:11 - mentioned you know free C Camp of course
48:12 - we're actively working to improve and to
48:14 - build a more general purpose uh you know
48:17 - validation environment to like be able
48:19 - to validate that people have actually
48:21 - completed assignments and being able to
48:23 - test different things but Sakai is your
48:25 - own project so I just want to point out
48:27 - like if people haven't heard of that the
48:29 - humility uh in you mentioning that you
48:31 - know that your own stuff is not good
48:33 - enough either and that you're working on
48:35 - it can you talk about Sakai real
48:37 - quick absolutely Sakai is an open source
48:39 - learning management system competing
48:41 - with Blackboard Moodle canvas and desire
48:44 - to learn uh as an Enterprise learning
48:46 - management system and uh we we were
48:49 - founded in uh 2004 and we end up peing
48:52 - at about a 6% worldwide market share in
48:55 - like 200 eight and we've been syncing
48:58 - ever since uh canvas basically is the
49:02 - current market leader in this space and
49:04 - they stole all our ideas and they stole
49:07 - all the standards that I helped
49:10 - build there's the standards the IMs
49:12 - learning tools interoperability ring of
49:14 - Appliance canvas is on there but they
49:16 - changed their logo since I put the
49:18 - tattoo on um and and what happened uh
49:23 - that makes why Sakai doesn't have a 6%
49:26 - or even 100% market share is that uh
49:29 - University's it organizations have given
49:32 - up on the notion of protecting student
49:34 - privacy and they just want a cloud
49:36 - provider that they like Google or
49:39 - Facebook that's going to make it so they
49:41 - don't have to worry about the software
49:43 - Sakai is open source software and so
49:45 - there's some worry involved in it that
49:47 - you got to run servers if it goes down
49:50 - if there's a bug that needs fixing you
49:51 - got to kind of go fix it whereas if you
49:53 - just Outsource to a cloud provider like
49:55 - canvas you you um don't have to think
49:58 - about it I mean our canvas was down for
50:00 - 3 Days the be beginning of the semester
50:03 - and the IT people were just cool as a
50:05 - cucumber because it's like it down but
50:08 - it's not my problem right it's very
50:10 - secure if they were running sakay at
50:12 - that same point in time they would be
50:13 - people on site 24 hours a day you know
50:16 - and so it the it organizations of these
50:20 - colleges are making convenience choices
50:22 - for the it organization that are
50:24 - completely compromising the student
50:26 - privacy and so Sakai is a competent
50:29 - piece of software that's on par with all
50:31 - these other ones the difference is is
50:33 - Sakai is not purely a cloud offering
50:36 - Blackboard canvas desired to learn is
50:38 - purely a cloud offering mood and Sakai
50:40 - are open source which means you can as a
50:42 - school keep the data in your own hands
50:44 - rather than just give it to a company
50:45 - that could be sold on a whim any day you
50:48 - wake up in the morning and you got a
50:50 - contract with them that says you'll be
50:51 - notified when they're sold and the
50:53 - answer is yep you'll be notified when
50:54 - they're sold but your data is gone by
50:56 - noon and you're like well I'm going to
50:58 - sue you for that and the answer is yep
51:00 - you sue but by then the money's all gone
51:02 - and it's all it's whatever so thing
51:05 - really annoys me about uh learning
51:06 - management system Marketplace is that it
51:09 - organizations are making decisions based
51:11 - on their staffs and Ci's convenience and
51:15 - they are making a powerful choice that
51:18 - is the wrong choice for their students
51:20 - privacy yeah they are handing that data
51:23 - off to third parties without even
51:25 - telling the student that their homework
51:28 - assignment on human sexuality is in the
51:31 - hands of a private company that could be
51:33 - sold anytime because if they express it
51:35 - that way the students be like I'm not
51:36 - going to turn my homework in anymore but
51:38 - they don't express it that way right
51:40 - they're like and it's it people that are
51:42 - like got their motivations all screwed
51:45 - up because they don't have talented
51:47 - people in it anymore
51:49 - so that's Sakai sakai's awesome but the
51:52 - the key thing that why I say Sakai I
51:55 - need to Beyond Sakai I need to Beyond
51:57 - corsera I need to Beyond edx and it has
52:00 - to do with that high school thing we
52:01 - talked about because what you are not
52:04 - capable doing with free code camp and
52:05 - what Sakai is not really capable of
52:07 - doing is also being a publisher into
52:10 - other people's Learning Management
52:11 - Systems of content people have to come
52:13 - to free code Camp they experience it on
52:15 - free code camp but what if a high school
52:17 - in Singapore wanted to take a course
52:19 - from free code camp and teach it on
52:21 - their system not just tell all the kids
52:23 - go log into free code Camp show me your
52:25 - certificate when you're you're done I'll
52:26 - give you a grade no no no no no it needs
52:29 - to be resources like a publisher like
52:31 - Pearson and Pearson my math lab Etc like
52:34 - what they would do what Pearson did with
52:37 - my math lab is they plug it into
52:38 - whatever school from ninth from seventh
52:41 - grade to PhD they plug it into wherever
52:45 - you're at and nothing including Sakai
52:47 - and what you've written does that and so
52:50 - we need to think like a
52:52 - publisher and so that's why I need to
52:54 - build a whole new generation of these
52:57 - things that look much like learning
52:59 - management systems but also function as
53:02 - publisher systems and so the problem is
53:04 - is we've gotten we've sort of just gone
53:06 - off into this like teach a course teach
53:08 - a course teach a course but we haven't
53:09 - thought so much about authoring and
53:11 - reuse modification and sharing courses
53:15 - because College professors don't want to
53:17 - think about teaching until August 27th
53:21 - and then on May 15th they want to stop
53:23 - thinking about teaching and so it's it's
53:25 - okay so but we need a whole new
53:29 - generation of
53:30 - software yeah which I'm working on
53:33 - awesome yeah and and uh I'm excited
53:36 - about this because again you're you're
53:37 - correct like free Cod camp like
53:39 - technically it's open source any
53:41 - University Professor or any uh you know
53:45 - admin at uh High School could just spin
53:47 - up a local version of free Coke game or
53:49 - even just white label and have it be
53:51 - like you know charger High um computer
53:55 - science program and it could basically
53:57 - be free Cod Camp running and that's
53:59 - totally fine that's within the terms of
54:01 - free C Camp is open source we use the
54:03 - bstd 3 license which is extremely
54:05 - permissive uh the only restriction that
54:07 - BSD has three has that MIT doesn't have
54:10 - is you can't pretend that you're free C
54:11 - Camp and that's for obvious reasons
54:12 - because we don't want people like
54:14 - capitalizing on our good open folks are
54:16 - very protective of trademarks and that's
54:18 - appropriate yeah yeah and we have
54:20 - Ironclad trademark here in the US and uh
54:23 - and other municipalities as well
54:25 - municipalities other other regions uh
54:27 - because we don't want scammers to
54:29 - pretend they're free go camp and rip
54:31 - people off yeah yeah yeah uh
54:35 - so wow uh like talking about higher
54:38 - education uh what would your advice be
54:42 - to a learner who's in India because we
54:45 - have a lot of people in like free C
54:47 - Camp's Community the way to look at it
54:49 - is like America is by far the biggest
54:51 - segment of people who use free code Camp
54:53 - the United States specifically then we
54:55 - have um India is second and then we have
54:58 - uh Brazil Nigeria uh and then like
55:01 - Europe if you want to look at like the
55:03 - EU area and and the UK like that would
55:05 - be kind of like the the there's a lot of
55:08 - people over there that use it too but
55:09 - but like India is huge and you just got
55:12 - back from India you flew over there my
55:14 - understanding is you went to like 10
55:16 - different universities like some
55:18 - Whirlwind tour can you talk about what
55:21 - that was like and then uh my main goal
55:24 - is to like understand what that was like
55:25 - but also to understand for Indian people
55:29 - that are watching this who are thinking
55:30 - about traveling to the US to get a
55:32 - master's degree like what they should
55:33 - consider doing or or people who are
55:35 - hoping to send their kids to the US to
55:38 - get a master's degree like you are an
55:40 - authority on computer science education
55:43 - and like I would you know presume also
55:46 - International students coming to the US
55:48 - to try to study computer science and get
55:50 - hb1 BS and work as software Engineers
55:51 - like you know a lot more about that than
55:53 - I
55:54 - do so
55:57 - first off my twoe trip to India was I
56:00 - got to feel like what it was like to be
56:01 - a celebrity in a real tiny little narrow
56:03 - world of computer science and that I was
56:06 - treated very well and uh you know people
56:09 - were applauding and there was standing
56:11 - room only rooms with 3,000 people in it
56:13 - and so and cars would take me places and
56:17 - food and airplane flights not private
56:20 - jets or anything but we just it was just
56:21 - fun to kind of be a
56:23 - celebrity um so I think and I actually
56:27 - think Quincy you are way ahead of the
56:31 - curve on this particular topic um you
56:34 - may or may not know that you're ahead of
56:35 - the curve on this particular topic but I
56:38 - I'll tell you what I envisioned 10 years
56:39 - from now and then what I'm going to try
56:42 - to put into place is we have
56:46 - historically thought of
56:48 - India as a place where um you can kind
56:52 - of Outsource stuff but you can't trust
56:55 - them you got to you know you know and
56:57 - then you hire someone in India to hire
56:59 - the people in India and then you're
57:01 - still not happy because you think I
57:04 - can't hire people directly in India and
57:07 - like what how would that work and and so
57:10 - there's been this kind of like
57:12 - Outsourcing business where all the
57:14 - Indian computer scientists work for
57:16 - companies who then resell them to United
57:19 - States to do kind of crap work right the
57:23 - work we just don't want to do and that's
57:25 - complet completely the wrong model
57:27 - that's completely the wrong model the
57:30 - other alternative is you save for two
57:32 - generations you come to United States
57:34 - and then you go work in Silicon Valley
57:36 - that's also completely the wrong model
57:38 - here's what the right model is the right
57:41 - model is that people who live in India
57:45 - like living in India their families are
57:48 - there their food is there they just like
57:51 - that people love India it's a great
57:54 - place to live you know it's a great
57:55 - place to raise a family it's there's
57:58 - lots of things about the Indian culture
57:59 - that you know that are just unnatural
58:02 - you know and when they come to America
58:05 - it's unnatural so how can't we come up
58:08 - with a scheme by
58:10 - which given what we learned in the
58:13 - pandemic about remote work can't we come
58:15 - up with a scheme by which companies
58:17 - simply directly hire Indian
58:21 - individuals and make them just part of
58:24 - the team and in doing so they pay them
58:28 - probably a quarter of the amount of
58:30 - money they'd have to pay them to live in
58:31 - Silicon Valley they live with their in
58:34 - their culture they enjoy their
58:37 - culture they're within their culture
58:39 - they're very well paid and then you just
58:42 - treat them like any other employee right
58:46 - and I I see you're nodding because
58:48 - you're already doing this and I know you
58:49 - are already doing this we have lots of
58:51 - teams from South team members from South
58:54 - Asia but they're not hidden behind some
58:57 - kind of like firewall of a of a
59:00 - consulting company right they're just
59:02 - people on your team that happen to show
59:05 - up in Zoom like everybody else shows up
59:07 - in Zoom right yeah and you know them and
59:10 - you get to grow and care for them now
59:12 - then imagine for a moment that you were
59:14 - a bigger company and you could afford to
59:16 - fly him to the United States for a while
59:18 - and you know have like a company Retreat
59:20 - and take all your Indian employees and
59:22 - your Singapore employees and bring
59:23 - everybody United States and so that they
59:25 - could enjoy United States they could get
59:27 - to know it they could like eat our food
59:29 - and then we they'd be like oh your
59:31 - food's no good I want to go home and eat
59:32 - really good food in my country right and
59:35 - so we got to get to the point where we
59:38 - the United States companies and
59:41 - organizations can benefit from this
59:43 - amazing pool of talent but without
59:46 - hiding behind like the contractors right
59:48 - they're just employees and we've learned
59:50 - to use zoom since 2020 we know it and so
59:56 - like you I have an Indian employee I
59:59 - figured out how taxes work I figured out
60:01 - how to write paychecks to Indian people
60:04 - and it's easy and it's great and there's
60:06 - companies that make it really really
60:08 - easy for a US organization to hire
60:11 - someone directly in India and then you
60:13 - become they're just another employee and
60:15 - you again
60:17 - locality post pandemic locality is less
60:20 - and less of an issue if we could fix it
60:23 - so that they could come on a tourist
60:25 - visa or a business visa for two weeks
60:27 - and enjoy meeting them in person so when
60:30 - I went to India I met my employee in
60:31 - person because it just turned out that
60:33 - he lives in one of the cities that I was
60:35 - in so I met him and he's doing really
60:39 - well I don't pay him nearly as much as I
60:42 - would pay a US employee and yet he is
60:46 - upper middle class where he lives right
60:48 - he's paying debts off and living a good
60:51 - life and and whatever and it's costing
60:54 - me not nearly as much money it would
60:56 - cause to have the same talent in the
60:58 - United States so what do we need to have
61:00 - that happen well it would be great if we
61:04 - had an educational
61:05 - system that at the end of their
61:07 - education they had some internships and
61:10 - the internships were Global and
61:13 - distributed and there was an
61:15 - organization that mediated all this so
61:20 - that maybe you know there would be like
61:22 - a kind of a code camp where you know
61:24 - people all over the world would
61:26 - participate in this posteducation camp
61:29 - where they're learning to work with
61:30 - people they're learning to work on
61:32 - professional software there's workshops
61:35 - there is internships there is connection
61:38 - between employers and employees there is
61:41 - funds from nonprofits to this
61:44 - hypothetical organization that creates
61:46 - free camp-like experiences around the
61:49 - world for
61:50 - technologists and we just like scale the
61:52 - crap out of that I mean does that sound
61:54 - like an okay thing
61:56 - yeah I think that'd be amazing uh I mean
61:59 - if it involves interfacing with the US
62:02 - government you're the closest to it
62:04 - right that's why the name of your
62:06 - company free code Camp about
62:09 - togetherness not just like free
62:11 - education but it's about togetherness
62:15 - yeah yeah I mean anything that
62:17 - interfaces with the US government and
62:19 - the Visa system like I used to be a
62:20 - School director and I worked for like
62:22 - this big Japanese conglomerate we had
62:24 - schools I ran a school in China I ran
62:26 - schools here in the United States and it
62:29 - was such an ordeal even with this giant
62:31 - corporation that was really old um like
62:34 - 50 60 years old uh that had all these
62:37 - connections with like the state
62:38 - department and had like this entire team
62:41 - that understood like government
62:42 - relations and all this stuff like it was
62:44 - an ordeal to be able to get people to
62:46 - come to the US uh and what you just said
62:49 - earlier about like flying are Indian
62:51 - team members uh we have uh a team member
62:53 - in India we have two in Bangladesh we
62:56 - have one in Pakistan uh and then we have
62:59 - like 21 different countries are
63:00 - represented on the freeo camp team 36
63:02 - people 21 different countries right um
63:06 - it is an ordeal to get even a tourist
63:09 - visa to get people like uh mesh uh who
63:12 - who's like basically the head of like
63:15 - all of our infrastructure he's kind of
63:16 - the equivalent of the CTO at free C Camp
63:18 - right he has been waiting for like a
63:21 - year to get his visa interview so
63:22 - hopefully he'll be able to come next
63:24 - year right uh but it's just it's a lot
63:28 - of paperwork and I don't really have the
63:31 - heart for it to be completely Ked like
63:33 - as much as I would like to bring people
63:34 - together I I I'm not the right person to
63:38 - do that but maybe there could be a
63:41 - charity that's focused on that that we
63:43 - could potentially partner with uh yeah I
63:48 - I'm talking about things 10 years I'm
63:49 - not talking about you got to do it next
63:50 - week right we know it's hard right yeah
63:53 - but we've got to lay down path in front
63:56 - of us that eventually leads to that as a
63:59 - natural thing right you know we're doing
64:02 - what we can do right now um I think the
64:04 - thing we got to work on in the short
64:06 - term is distributed scalable
64:09 - internships that's but the problem with
64:12 - that is that uh students have to have
64:14 - enough talent to be worthy of that
64:16 - because you can't just say I don't know
64:18 - anything about programming I'm a TR
64:19 - truck driver why don't I start with an
64:21 - internship and the answer is you will be
64:24 - ejected from that internship at at a
64:26 - very high velocity right because you're
64:29 - useless yeah mentoring only happens when
64:32 - you have skills it doesn't happen
64:34 - because you want skills it happens
64:37 - because you have skills and so our job
64:39 - yours and mine is to create a curriculum
64:42 - where they get the skills so that when
64:44 - they're sort of nominated for an
64:46 - internship people go like o yummy that's
64:49 - the kind of skills I could use at a very
64:51 - low cost and it's all taken care of by
64:54 - whatever and now I can get them to work
64:56 - on my project and and and and oh in a
64:59 - year I'm going to just hire them anyway
65:01 - so away we go and so that to me is the
65:04 - thing is it's not just let's do
65:05 - internships let's not just have free
65:07 - code camps around fires around the world
65:10 - if there's no skills involved you know
65:12 - and non-trivial skills right this is the
65:14 - back to the master programmer so for me
65:15 - the master programmer is the
65:18 - prerequisite to entry into internships
65:21 - because I don't like mentoring people
65:24 - who have no skills I've just not going
65:25 - to do
65:26 - it yeah and the reason why these
65:30 - internships are so selective in like
65:32 - Silicon Valley and the reason why they
65:33 - are so remunerative is is a twofold
65:37 - reason from the way I understand one
65:39 - they want to identify the best talent
65:40 - before they even bring them in they want
65:41 - to make sure they're actually going to
65:42 - be able to productively get things done
65:44 - and it's also like kind of a cheap
65:46 - pipeline for identifying talent that
65:48 - they can bring on cuz like most of the
65:51 - people I know they got an internship at
65:53 - Google or Microsoft or like a big tech
65:55 - company
65:56 - they also at the end of that internship
65:58 - got extended like a job offer and then
66:00 - they could join that was that was
66:02 - basically like corporate training for
66:04 - being able to join their company it's
66:05 - kind of the equivalent of going through
66:06 - like an employ employee boot camp almost
66:08 - being an intern and I agree internships
66:11 - are great because they're paid and uh
66:14 - they can they work within the US
66:16 - framework of visas and I know we're
66:18 - talking about letting people stay in
66:19 - their home country and not having to go
66:21 - through this you know naturalization
66:23 - process my wife went through that
66:24 - naturalization process by the way uh we
66:26 - met when I was in grad school in China
66:29 - uh in tingan uh and uh she eventually
66:33 - you know came to the US got a green card
66:34 - worked here for many years and uh was
66:37 - able to naturalize as a US citizen but
66:39 - like it was it was a big ordeal and you
66:42 - know apart from reforming the
66:44 - immigration system which we don't talk a
66:45 - lot about political things on uh the
66:48 - free C Camp podcast but like I'm I'm a
66:49 - huge believer in making it much easier
66:51 - for skilled immigrants to come to this
66:53 - country uh and I'm I'm very vocal about
66:55 - that I'm not I'm not going to put you on
66:56 - the spot and see what you think about
66:58 - immigration or anything like that but
67:00 - like apart from making it easier for
67:03 - talented people to come and work and
67:05 - contribute to the economic activity help
67:07 - us build up the tech ecosystem here in
67:09 - the United States pay taxes uh all of
67:12 - those things uh I do love the idea of
67:15 - just making it easier for people to get
67:17 - promising internships and helping more
67:19 - companies realize that internships are a
67:21 - path forward and that they can actually
67:23 - get really talented internships so that
67:25 - like even small businesses could
67:26 - potentially have interns that have a
67:29 - certain Baseline of skills who can come
67:31 - on board and there's an independent
67:33 - Arbiter of those skills right now the
67:36 - Arbiters of those skills are like Linux
67:38 - Foundation CompTIA and of course
67:40 - University degree programs whom it
67:43 - sounds like you would say those degree
67:45 - programs like computer sized programs
67:47 - are not sufficiently robust in uh
67:50 - helping sort people who are ready for an
67:52 - internship from people who just coasted
67:54 - through a CS program and aren't even
67:56 - that passionate about it just went
67:57 - because their parents pushed them to go
67:59 - to CS because it's a remunerative degree
68:01 - program
68:03 - right yeah I just I think that the Cs
68:06 - has kind of been lazy in their
68:07 - curriculum because it doesn't matter
68:09 - what they teach because you know they
68:12 - teach you know 80% of it is a waste and
68:14 - 20% of it is good and then I think you
68:16 - and I could teach the 20% without the
68:18 - 80% and achieve the same result yeah I
68:21 - mean from an from an immigration
68:23 - perspective what if the demand isn't
68:24 - there and United States and we just
68:26 - can't assume that the it's been demand
68:28 - has been infinite for kind of for 35 or
68:31 - 40 years for new software developers
68:34 - because that's the that's the crash in
68:36 - the software industry right and now and
68:39 - so let me just and I got to go to my
68:41 - flying lesson in a little bit you're
68:43 - looking at the clock and I'm looking at
68:45 - I got to go to my flying lesson bit
68:48 - um the reason in my opinion for the
68:51 - crash in the tech
68:53 - industry and the reason it's not going
68:55 - to
68:56 - recover is
69:00 - simple in 2006 Google needed to build a
69:04 - low latency distributed file system a
69:08 - thing that had never been invented and
69:10 - never been
69:11 - built that could have like 11 copies of
69:15 - your data and have 12 nines of
69:18 - reliability and so in 2006 they
69:22 - needed 5,000 software developers to
69:25 - solve that extremely difficult problem
69:30 - properly what problem and then they had
69:33 - to do like big table and then they used
69:35 - page Rank and then they did this and
69:38 - they did
69:39 - that the question if you look at Amazon
69:42 - let's just say you're the CTO of Amazon
69:44 - right now what are the five most
69:48 - important strategic innovations that
69:51 - Amazon needs to do right now in terms of
69:54 - its infrastructure and whatever can you
69:57 - think of anything that Amazon even needs
70:00 - to do that would require a thousand
70:02 - people technology wise I mean I have a
70:05 - limited you know uh view into like what
70:09 - their day-to-day I mean if they if
70:11 - they're going to be serious about drone
70:12 - delivery maybe that would be an area
70:14 - like that they would need to invest
70:17 - a but I I can't really think anything
70:19 - off the top of my head how about we
70:21 - invent a technology that makes it so
70:24 - robots can do Pick and Pull in large
70:28 - warehouses so that we can more
70:30 - efficiently fill trucks up so people can
70:32 - get stuff in one day instead of two days
70:34 - why don't why don't we hire a bunch of
70:36 - people to figure out that robot
70:38 - technology oh
70:40 - wait it's already done right so that's
70:43 - the problem right you look at the things
70:45 - that Amazon Google Facebook Twitter and
70:50 - you look at what they've accomplished so
70:52 - far you they have a achieved a lot and
70:56 - then un yet as as yet unachieved things
70:59 - are way smaller in 2024 than they were
71:03 - in 2012 or
71:06 - 2006 so we shouldn't expect that
71:09 - whatever the number of software
71:11 - developers Amazon
71:12 - needs that is now shrunk is going to get
71:16 - big again that's not saying it's zero
71:17 - right because drone delivery and who
71:19 - knows what else right you
71:21 - know but man there has been a lot of
71:25 - technology achievement in the last 20
71:28 - years and these guys have products and
71:31 - systems and trucks and people and that
71:36 - stuff works and you don't need to invent
71:37 - a new
71:39 - thing right Maps worldwide accurate Maps
71:43 - solved I'm not saying it doesn't need
71:45 - any software developers it just doesn't
71:47 - need tens of thousands of software
71:48 - developers so that notion if you think
71:51 - about why we needed an H1B and I'm not
71:53 - anti- H1B I'm just looking at the things
71:56 - that lead to the lack of demand the
71:59 - reduced demand that I think is
72:01 - permanent now that doesn't mean that we
72:02 - don't that we don't need any programmers
72:05 - we just don't need the kinds of people
72:07 - with a PhD in computer
72:09 - science that they needed at Google in
72:13 - 2010 it's never coming back and so what
72:16 - you and I need to do is we need to
72:18 - educate a
72:20 - populace for the things the market
72:22 - actually wants in 2024
72:25 - not pretend that it's still
72:27 - 2010 yeah and so we think about how does
72:30 - that
72:32 - work and that gets us back a bit to the
72:37 - the problems that really are important
72:39 - our people problems and the technical
72:40 - problems are getting easier and easier
72:43 - so if we kind of start teaching
72:45 - technical stuff in high school and
72:48 - letting people take liberal arts degrees
72:50 - and work great with people and create
72:52 - wonderful distributed teams to solve
72:53 - whatever human problem we need to solve
72:56 - that is the humans will always want a
72:58 - new thing right they'll they'll want a
73:00 - new Uber like thing and that's going to
73:02 - take some work but the human problems
73:04 - are as important as the technology
73:06 - problems if you're starting a company
73:07 - like uber so yeah how many minutes do
73:11 - you have before your flight lesson I
73:12 - want to make sure you make that and uh
73:14 - but I I do have like a ton of additional
73:16 - questions we got about five more minutes
73:17 - okay I'm just gonna fire these more
73:19 - minutes fire these off first of all
73:21 - you're doing you're doing flight this is
73:23 - this is like a soft question but you
73:25 - also in addition to flying planes you
73:27 - race
73:28 - cars what's the story behind that I do
73:31 - race
73:32 - cars um well I just I just like um I
73:37 - like I like very organic racing local
73:39 - racing I don't like F1 or NASCAR
73:42 - anything like that uh what I really like
73:44 - doing is driving fast around a track in
73:46 - a track prepared car so that when I so I
73:50 - don't have to speed to get my jollies on
73:52 - entrance ramps to to highways and so can
73:55 - afford I race in this thing called the
73:57 - 24 hours of lemons which is supposedly a
74:00 - $500 car that races a 16-hour endurance
74:03 - race but it just lets me get my
74:06 - excitement out of my system with uh
74:10 - without having to be highly testosterone
74:13 - so I'm not a I'm like I have a five on
74:15 - my race car my racing team I am either
74:18 - the worst or the second tourist racer
74:20 - meaning in terms of you look at the
74:21 - times my times are terrible compared to
74:23 - my brother and my NE you and but we
74:26 - don't care because we're not trying to
74:27 - win we're just trying to really enjoy
74:29 - the day and drive around the track so
74:31 - it's just it's a very fun hobby we like
74:34 - preparing the cars and building them and
74:36 - uh and so that's where the racing hobby
74:38 - comes in awesome uh well we didn't even
74:42 - have time to talk about AI uh if I know
74:46 - you've answered this question like
74:47 - repeatedly when you were traveling
74:49 - through India and probably a whole lot
74:50 - since then but if you had just like a
74:52 - one minute answer to why people
74:54 - shouldn't be worried specifically about
74:56 - AI as programmers but you know all the
74:59 - other things that you mentioned that
75:00 - they should be worried about what would
75:02 - be
75:04 - like I was asked the question of why
75:06 - take any classes when AI is going to
75:08 - solve every problem yeah and I in a
75:11 - space of 14 days I gave the same talk
75:14 - over and over and over again and answer
75:15 - that question over and over and over
75:17 - again and as I was experiencing all the
75:20 - other things I was refining the answer
75:22 - to that question so I got to the point
75:25 - in the second to last one where I came
75:27 - up with an answer that that silenced the
75:30 - whole room right they're like why should
75:33 - I learn to program with AI and it
75:36 - happened because they were giving me a
75:37 - tour at the lovely professional
75:39 - University in Northern India and they
75:42 - were showing me people working on
75:45 - drones building new drones and I walked
75:48 - into that room and these young people
75:50 - were showing me their drones and the
75:52 - thing that was going off in my head is
75:53 - like aren't drones a solved problem I
75:57 - can go to Best Buy and buy a drone and I
76:02 - go like and it just drives around are
76:04 - drones a solve problem and then I
76:06 - started thinking about this because I'm
76:08 - old enough to remember when we first
76:10 - started hearing about quadcopters and Ai
76:14 - and WiFi and coordination of them and I
76:17 - remember seeing videos of like person
76:19 - starting up a quadcopter and it like
76:22 - crash they got nets all around it and it
76:24 - crashes into the the wall and breaks
76:26 - into a million pieces and they make
76:27 - another quadcopter and I'm thinking like
76:29 - there was a time when we the world did
76:32 - not know how to make quadcopters so
76:35 - here's what I'm telling you to do let's
76:37 - just say
76:39 - quadcopters were not in existence in
76:41 - 2000 so what I want you to do is I want
76:44 - you to
76:45 - grab uh all the Nvidia processors you
76:49 - want um and I want you to put those in a
76:54 - suitcase
76:55 - and grab all the like AI Wizards that
76:59 - you can grab software developers and
77:01 - stuff and I want you to time travel back
77:03 - to
77:05 - 2000 and I want you to arrive in 2000
77:07 - and you plug Invidia processors in you
77:10 - plug the internet in and you
77:13 - say llm read everything in the world
77:17 - today and so we take an llm back to 2000
77:20 - and the LM reads everything in 2000 and
77:22 - the llm finally comes up
77:26 - like in hit trer Guide to the Galaxy the
77:27 - hit llm comes up and the people gather
77:30 - and we're going to ask it one
77:32 - question and that
77:34 - is I am interested in building a
77:37 - quadcopter that's automatically
77:40 - self-leveling that uses Wi-Fi to find
77:42 - its way Wi-Fi existed in 2000 uses Wi-Fi
77:44 - to find its way around and I want to
77:46 - hold a thing in my hand and drive it
77:48 - around that AI the the perfect Genius of
77:52 - all Humanity's future has no data in
77:57 - 2000 to invent a quad
77:59 - copper nothing it's like uh what's a
78:04 - quadcopter right that's it that's all
78:06 - you get from it and so we're excited
78:10 - about the fact that it's looking
78:11 - backwards in time at already solved
78:13 - problems and it can regurgitate the
78:15 - already solved problems with a little
78:16 - remixing a bit and we're like that's the
78:18 - future and the answer is no that's not
78:20 - the future the future is things we can't
78:22 - even conceive
78:23 - of so AI doesn't help us with the things
78:26 - we can't conceive of it does help us
78:28 - with the things that are passed it's
78:30 - really good search engine and I love it
78:32 - I mean it's great I use it all the time
78:34 - but to say that there is no need for
78:36 - futur looking creativity or any kind of
78:38 - research because AI is going to do it
78:40 - for us the answer is no it's not it's
78:42 - terrible at looking forward it really is
78:44 - terrible at looking forward it's great
78:46 - at looking back so there's that that's
78:48 - the AI thing and when I said that
78:49 - finally I'm they like oh yeah they right
78:52 - it can't know things that it's not been
78:57 - told yeah yeah I mean that's very much
79:00 - my sentiment like it's great I use it
79:01 - almost like as a replacement for Google
79:03 - in some situations like if I have a
79:05 - longtail query that Google's I know I'm
79:06 - just going to get gibberish on Google
79:08 - I'll go and ask it and it does a decent
79:10 - job uh or if I needed to make it like
79:12 - really specific associations like with
79:14 - language learning stuff it's super
79:15 - useful I really appreciate your time
79:19 - sharing these insights uh sharing the
79:22 - reassurance that people are still going
79:24 - to need to learn programming people are
79:25 - still going to need to have domain
79:26 - expertise people are still going to need
79:28 - to do all the things they're doing
79:30 - today even though we have this tool that
79:32 - makes it much easier to synthesize past
79:34 - knowledge it's not going to create new
79:36 - knowledge right I mean it may be able to
79:38 - do very specific things like go out and
79:40 - try all these novel combinations of you
79:42 - know like for drug Discovery for example
79:44 - I think I that it's got a lot of
79:45 - potential in that area but it's not
79:46 - going to be able to do anything you
79:48 - don't really tell it to do within like a
79:51 - kind of a bounded space
79:52 - so thank you again for your Time Dr
79:55 - Chuck it's been an absolute honor having
79:57 - you on the podcast this is you've been
79:59 - on my list of guests to have for
80:00 - literally years at this point and uh I'm
80:03 - I'm very excited to meet with you
80:04 - hopefully talk with you some more about
80:06 - the future of higher education uh
80:09 - practical kind of like vocational
80:11 - programming education uh so uh is there
80:14 - any message you want to leave people
80:16 - with before we sign
80:19 - off I I think uh the importance of fre
80:22 - code C Camp is going to go up not down I
80:25 - mean I think that there are things about
80:27 - your model that are more scalable and
80:29 - sustainable than any other model for
80:31 - educating the
80:33 - world thank you I'm gon to incorporate
80:37 - as much of your feedback as possible and
80:38 - we're going to keep this momentum going
80:41 - that we have with the free C Camp
80:42 - Community thanks again for all your
80:44 - support for all your uh thoughtful
80:46 - feedback over the years and for creating
80:48 - these amazing free learning resources
80:50 - many of which we're publishing on fre C
80:52 - Camp so be sure to check the show notes
80:54 - and you can you can see some of Dr
80:55 - Chuck's amazing coursework I'll also
80:57 - include links to some of your various
80:59 - websites thanks again Dr
81:01 - Chuck thank you Quincy and until next
81:05 - week everybody happy
81:07 - coding cheers

Cleaned transcript:

I think that the Cs has kind of been lazy in their curriculum because it doesn't matter what they teach because you know they teach you know 80% of it is a waste and 20% of it is good and then I think you and I could teach the 20% without the 80% and re achieve the same result welcome back to the freeco camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freeco camp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people in Tech this week we are talking to Dr Chuck Dr Charles sance computer science professor at University of Michigan one of the top computer science programs in the world Dr Chuck has created many free learning resources over the years including his python for everyone course extremely popular he's created courses on C programming language D Jango web development framework so many different things and he's made them freely available for Learners we published several courses of his on the freeo camp YouTube channel Dr Chuck it's an honor to have you on the podcast how are you doing today I'm doing great Quincy and it is an honor to be on the podcast you have lots and lots of people and you're so successful to free code camp and and I know I knew you when you were like smaller but you just keep growing and growing you're staff your your viewership and everything and so it's exciting to see see you grow thank you sir uh again like uh I don't want to be overly differential but like you have been a huge inspiration to me over the years and I know to boars and to a lot of the folks on the Freo Camp team who are building these open learning resources uh so I I'm just gonna like we we usually talk about like programmer origin stories and stuff like that but I've got so many things that I want to talk to you about I'm just going to dive right into it uh and we're going to start talking about programming the craft the art the thing that it like most developers do daytoday what is a master programmer well it is the art and it is the craft the master programmer is my way of emphasizing that programming is not mathematics right programming is a creative thing and um margin story is really simple I mean I am an artist at heart uh I wanted to be in theater I mean I wanted to go to New York City after I graduated from high school my mom said why don't you go be an engineer first and um and so I'm I'm a very creative person right and and I but every time I try to draw art it's terrible because I just don't have high ey coordination or maybe it's not patience and when I'm at computers I'm like I can make a Hangman game and I can just sit at my keyboard as long as I type it right then I got a Hangman game and so the key to it was it was a way of expressing creative artistic Concepts but not requiring like a charcoal pencil to kind of shade everything and so the master the master programmer is the same concept let's just say applied to carpentry I know Master carpenters and you can literally drop a master Carpenter into any situation right you might have like a Stairway that's gotten wet and started to rot and the master compentent looks in goes like okay I've never seen this situation before but it's like a jillion other situations that I looked at before and they all of a sudden creatively are just generating a solution it's carpentry is not just like you know order a bunch of stuff and then go and um you know plug that thing in and make it all happen and so I think of the master programmer in the same way and the master programmer are these people that I know who are you know mid to late career people that can learn anything can do anything you can switch them to from java to react and they they're they're com comfortable in a couple of weeks and so they're just like amazing and you can throw them into any situation and then I I think of sort of the the way a master Carpenter becomes a master Carpenter and I want to imitate that by sort of mentoring by observation by slowly learning more stuff and then applying that stuff and getting really good at things and then eventually you are the master programmer and so the other reason I'm talking about the master programmer is I the one thing that the master programmer is not is a computer science degree I've literally never met a person who graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science that I would consider even partially a master programmer frankly they're terrible programmers computer science encourages extremely bad programming behavior and that's because they they they tell you to do this assignment and you got a week to do it and then you get it done on time and then you throw it away and then they give you a different thing to do and they give you a week to do it and you throw it away that's not what Master programmers do they come into your house and your stairs have got a rotted part and they're going to leave your house and you're going to have a fixed stairs for the next 20 years and a master programmer is the same way they they can work on software that lives long it's not maybe the most uptodate thing and and and and so I'm I'm kind of like also the enemy of things like lead code I hate lead code because leak code turns such a creative person and I'm not saying computer science students aren't creative and aren't smart and aren't wonderful and aren't talented what I'm saying is they have been taught that lead code is the purpose of their life and that's leak code is like the the Amazon fulfillment center version of you know creativ of artwork right yeah meaning that leite code you are a robot I will stick you in this room I will measure you I'll watch your blood pressure and heart rate and then based on your blood pressure and heart rate and how much how many packages you get done in an hour then I'm going to give you some numeric rating and by the way your your your average which is like oh I can't be average that must be terrible and so leak code computer science take away all the humanity of what it is that we do and if you think for example of what you've done since free code Camp was created it's not mathematical it's it's like you just have to sit and go like what what could we do whoa that's a let's try that right it's so getting things done quickly and moving on to the next thing and like you said like the Amazon Fulfillment of software as opposed to um actually like learning how to do it right and then doing every job right so that it you know it kind of stand to the the rigors of time uh and uh you know not be reclaimed by Nature as so many code bases are the moment that the programmer walks away from them right yeah um yes well you know we're not we are going to talk about computer science programs and and I I think it's oh you're back yeah I'm back sorry okay so um just just a quick uh heads up we're using the uh we're using Riverside to record this and sometimes uh if people disconnect and reconnect uh my apologies to those watching the video version but um yes so uh one of the things that you've been a huge advocate of uh for helping people learn programming is to really encourage people to learn C properly C being probably one of the most primordial programming languages still in use today uh most Things are Written In C it's like when we talk about layers of abstraction they're usually layers of abstraction on top of C somewhere in the the pile of pillows right um why should people study C in 2024 the the reason is is that the the best programmers like I said can be dropped into a completely new environment and you give them four weeks and then they probably will be the best at that new environment than other mediocre programmers who've been working in that environment for years and the reason is is that they have a mental model of what's going on inside of computers and so they're like oh we're going to do Rust and react okay rust and react is just another syntax and but the computer is the same and so all they need to do in their four weeks of coming up to speed and rust and react is kind of just glue the rust stuff to all the wonderful structures that are in their brain already and so the problem is is if if we just teach people python they're they're they're going to be capable of doing things but they don't understand what's really happening so if I take someone who's really good in Python and say you're going to go into a rough and react project they're like uh how about we convert your 10yearold rust and reactor software to python so I understand it like no no no I didn't hire you to tell me to convert my rust program to python where is a a master programmer goes like yeah rust is just another thing I'll figure that out and how is it that a master programmer can go from python to rust and then to Scala and then and Java and whatever and just do that every few months as needed maybe even every few weeks as needed and so what I'm thinking is I'm like how do people get that sort of agility in their mind that nothing is nothing is hard for them nothing scares them anymore and that's where C comes in and that is python is a great place to start right it's kind of a middle level abstraction there's lots of things that build on top of it things that you know you can do in Python and it it brings people into the Technology field than career with the least amount of wasted time I mean you just take a python class a month or two later you you're ready to do some work right you're let ready to learn the problem is is you're not ready to be agile you're not ready to evolve think of like Pokemons right you get this Pokemon and then you want to evolve your evolve your Pokemon well you're a python programmer you want to evolve your Python program and you're not capable of evolving so C learning C and then later learning Hardware even though it's a very gentle introduction to see and a very gentle introduction to Hardware is an investment in later being able to evolve to anything programming language that don't exist UI Frameworks that don't currently exist if there's one thing in Tech it changes all the time and so if you want to be ready for what goes on there is no way you can go to college and learn the 250 different technologies that are being used used in the industry today you got to learn each of those when the time comes so what can I teach you I can teach you C you know that's 1978 so that's like 50 years old and 40 years old whatever it's old and uh if I teach you C then I can give you the tools that let you learn a new thing every few weeks and master that new thing not just like oh okay I printed hello world and C then I printed hello world Rost I put it hello world in react no no no no no you got to go in and maintain a large application in Rust and react and and see is the key to that and because I can't just teach you rust and I can't teach you schola and I can't teach you all the hundreds of things that you're going to encounter in the real world but I can teach you see and I want you to really understand it and that way you've got a mental model of how computers work and that's why Hardware is important too so the next class I'm going to uh create after the cclass is a hardware class but it'll be like everything I do it'll be gentle and fun it'll take you a little while and you walk away with this solid knowledge in the back of your mind that you keep forever and then you can apply it to any new situation that you you run into awesome and is that of course going to also be in the uh for everybody like line you you got absolutely you got C I think you got C for everybody you've got python for everybody Django for everybody uh you may not know this but Kylie Ying uh she's a software engineer at Google and she also works at fre Cod camp and she creates courses for us and a few years ago I reached out and I said hey could we do uh a course called machine learning for everybody and like have it be a spiritual successor to your uh you know python for everybody because you know it's uses Python and that course has like five million views on YouTube that's it's like one of the most popular machine learning courses of all time and it's very much in the vein of the work that you've already done uh thank you for giving us permission to kind of use that that title structure it's an honor and I'm glad that someone other than me is doing AI for everybody because I I don't I I find AI too difficult right I'm trying to create people who can drop into Ai and figure it all out but I don't want to figure it out myself right and so part of with the whole for everybody thing is I gotta think very deeply about every second of every course so that I don't inadvertently make it more difficult than it needs to be so for her to do AI for everybody thumbs up awesome yeah well I am very excited to talk about AI um I but this Hardware thing uh I I really want to talk about this because uh a lot of people don't appreciate how networks work how operating systems work how things get written to memory uh all these different uh Concepts that you learn if you get like a a traditional Computer Engineering degree which not very many people get anymore because it's the computer science degrees that the employers are looking for right uh maybe you could talk a little bit about what you think if if you could just almost kind of list like a table of contents of what your course is ultimately likely to contain that would be really cool just kind of like information people can put in their back pocket so they can be looking out for those things when they're sifting around for courses on YouTube or if they're like at the library like trying to check out some books to like backfill their knowledge and understanding of these things absolutely let me I'll get to the table of contents because that's pretty easy um let me talk about my own education and where I encountered hardware and how it affected me um so you know I'm in the middle of a computer science degree chug chug chug chug chug and then I I take a hardware class right and um I I all of a sudden sort of get this situation where I'm completely obsessed with like chip layout and in chip layout it's very artistic and it's pretty and there's colors and it's like red and blue and and black and on this background and you're drawing these little traces to make chips or to make boards you draw traces and it's like this is so visual and so in this class we were laying out some and Gates and or Gates and flipflops using painting basically because you paint various materials then you make masks and they put those materials down and then you make chips out of that and I saw that and I had this project and I sat down at a computer back then it was a sun workstation and I literally didn't get up from that computer for 48 hours I was so like it's like Gamers right I just 48 Hours laying out chips learning the software this is the greatest thing ever and then I finished the class and I never took another Hardware class again right because I didn't need to know how to do that professionally but the the sense of what a professional Hardware Builder does is been very precious to me and I loved the kind of quick brief interlude into how that works and and again I I have no interest in building Hardware none whatsoever I like software and so uh hardware for everybody is just the right sampling and so uh the the key thing in hardware for everybody or computer architecture for everybody is what I call it um first we're going to start with transistors and then we're going to build a notot gate and then we're going to build a nand gate and then we're going to you know build a couple other Gates out of transistors and then we will build a flipflop out of transistors and then we'll start playing with things like flipflops and and Gates and or Gates and we'll make a half adder then we'll make a full adder um then we'll you know do a ripple carry add for like four bits and then we will stop on the hardware on the lowlevel like circuitry ones and zeros going through traces and wires and turning lights on and turning lights off that's enough that that's enough and then what we're going to do is we're going to start looking at machine language and that is how programs can be written with zeros and ones I mean what it does it mean it's all full of zeros and ones well it's not really zeros and ones it's little electric traces that are the little little electric pulses that are moving down wires that's what's going on and so but some at some point it goes from gates to instructions so I will have a machine language which is you program a you will write code with zeros and ones and I will teach you machine language then I'll teach you Assembly Language which is nothing more than a direct translation to those zero zero and ones each line of an assembling language program trans directly translates directly to a series of zeros and ones and so we'll write a machine language we'll write in Assembly Language we'll even write a simple assembler and and that's pretty much well we will do one little thing where we will run the C compiler and look at the assembler output of a c compiler so we understand how compilers create assembly language and then how that Assembly Language turns into machine code and how that machine code runs uh on computers and so everything that I ever do and we're not very good at making all my autog graders work well on free code Camp everyone has to come to my site like CC free.com and do the auto GD which is okay free code Camp is kind of the video part of it and my websites are free and they are the the autog grader part of it but the hardest part for the computer architecture for everybody is going to be the Auto graders cuz I'm going to build a chip layout system cuz I can't find one free that's kind of me right I mean there are products out there but I think they're a too hard and B they're they want to make money off this stuff they should just give me a free one but they're not going to give me a free one so I have got to build an in browser JavaScript based chip layout system where I can give an assignment to lay out a chip or lay out a circuit in the browser and then I can put probe points on that chip and then I can autograde the fact that you have actually built a half adder so I got to I got to build all that technology and when I build courses autog graders come first I just the assignments need to scale and the assignments are where the actual Learning Happens not just the me talking um and so that's the basic outline right transistors Gates kind of small circuits made up of gates machine language assembler compiler to assembler it'll be shorter than most of my courses that I teach awesome I just want to say on the note of the autog grader we're developing our own uh Auto graders around like networks and uh chips and like systems on chips like there's only so much you can really simulate in like a browser uh and accurately test but uh we're working with a software engineer who also has like a hardware background and we're we're developing kind of our own autog graders for those sorts of things so we may be able to collaborate on that and make it open source I mean you got to you got to find a way to get learning tools interoperability to your infrastructure so that anybody can write an auto grader in any topic and plug it into your your system that's the key you you and com Academy build a complete custom system and corsera that's all just blobbed into one thing for every course but if you use learning tools interoperability then you can kind of have a nice bright boundary point where autog grads live out there and the core system that you're doing grading and tracking that lives in here but yeah and one of these days you're still netlify right so we were using netlify we may be using it for some things uh we just uh I mean we have like hund like more than aund servers around the world uh so people in Singapore uh like we have a Singapore server so people in East Asia we've got like Latin American servers so everybody has like a low ping and um and we do have autog graders for JavaScript we have autog graders uh for or a lot of them just run inside a Google collaboratory for like the machine learning related tasks um and then we have uh autog graders for python but uh and we we'd like to build like a more generic like Auto grader where people could essentially have this library that they could include um so that is like a longterm goal of ours uh but like pretty much everything we design in terms of interactive design Interactive Learning we start from the premise of like how can we test this program atically so that they don't have to submit something and wait for a human to review it so that we can keep this like abut millisecond length feedback loop so people can rapidly iterate and yeah it's like a game you're you're at a boss right you're just you're just struggling with it you're figuring it out that's the moment of learning right and if we can make something that does not require the delay of a human being involved that means it's more like playing a video game where you can you got an hour and you struggle and you learn and you struggle and you learn and you and then you're you break through and then you're like oh and you didn't have to wait and so that's what why autog graders are always for me the most important part because then I like I make autog graders then I create assignments in the autog graders and then I make sure that I have a lecture that supports the learning objectives of what I'm going to assign as homework right and so it's a assessments are important and they're the most they're the most intricate to me part of of anything and now now you're probably building a much more sophisticated Hardware environment than I am because my circuit layout the hard the most difficult thing it needs to build is a 4bit ripple carry Adder which really tiny compared to like a chip or anything like that and this is where I'd let the if you're going to be a professional Hardware designer go go go to get a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering or computer engineering that's fine but I don't I think for everybody we just need to know enough to believe that we could figure out if we had to yeah I'm I'm right there with you like and one of the things that you've advocated for over the years is learning fewer things but learning them more deeply um and and retaining them and retaining them can you talk about like let's say somebody's like a first year computer science or maybe they're a fourth year and they're about to graduate and they have to make up for just kind of coasting along and doing what their teachers have been saying um and they need they need to backfill and they need to to fill in this knowledge or uh like about a third of the people in the free cam Community are career Changers who are coming from completely different fields maybe accounting maybe driving a truck uh maybe doing any number of uh different jobs that have various levels of technical proficiency associated with them or basically not not even using a computer as part of their job right um what advice would you have as far as the few things that they should focus on learning deeply if you just had to Rattle off a list well I think that uh python C like any web framework I pick Django um I mean everything is going to have the web there should be some API stuff in there and I look at like what are the four or five courses that you need in order to learn everything else and I've got this talk I I give and I gave it in India back in February to a bunch of schools and the idea was is I took all the things that you might encounter in the real world at work and I'm like okay among all these topics which of them fall below the line which means that we should teach everybody these topics and um I came up with four topics um and then three more topics and then I called that the path to the master programmer and that is what are what in effect in 2024 is a computer science degree equivalent because computer science degrees designed in 1978 when it was actually difficult and so yeah it took four years and that's the problem is is that they just make it harder but it they don't they don't they don't teach more essential things and so for me I want to cut it down to the essentials so that a person who's switching from a truck driving job to a programming job can do so in less than a year and so the path and master programmer is python see D Jango which is really more about web object orientation is a real important learning objective that I don't think has done well in computer science at all um Hardware JavaScript Java and then an internship in open source and then I going to take that truck driver and say you can go to work and the first thing that they're going to learn when they go to work is potentially none of those things that I just taught them because they'll probably react in scholar or some crazy thing like that but they'll figure it out and so that's the that is my distilling of the essence of a computer science degree into in effect seven three credit college courses now my secret hidden agenda is the time we should teach these seven courses is between the age of 14 uh 13 and 16 because people who are 15 years old their minds are like a vacuum cleaner CU if you want retention teach somebody something when they're 14 15 or 16 years old and the the way I teach courses is they're ready for high school and I got a friend who's a high school teacher and he keeps testing this and you'd be amazed at how brilliant they are graduating from high school and so imagine if we could take 25% of the people graduating from high school and give them what I consider to be the equivalent of computer science bachelor's light which is what the master programmer is how would the world change if a person could make 40 50 or $60,000 as a software developer graduating at 17 years old from high school what would their next education look like when they don't have to go get a computer science education when we taught it to him in high school and I mean I think that's a fun thing to think about and I'll you know the future looks like the past just later and that is wouldn't it be amazing if our children in 10 years were could make 60,000 bucks a year out of high school and then when we went to college they could take a really cool liberal arts degree I mean they're already professional programmers and then they go on liberal arts degree and they're like yeah I know how to program and then I want to be a lawyer or I want to be an economist oh and by the way coming along with me is professional programmer skills so every person who goes in the Congress every person who drives a train every person who drives a truck is already a software developer right yeah and I mean that's that's why the for everybody is for everybody it's really for high school students that you know but but I don't think anyone would take a class called python for high school students but that's really what I am building that's cool I had no idea that that was like like I didn't really think that much about the the name because like free C Camp like a vast majority of people who use free C Camp are in their 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s um we even have some people in their 70s and 80s doing it but like the median learner age is like 30 so these are people who've already gotten out of college and studied some field that like is difficult to pay off their student debt with a lot of times uh like I I studied liberal arts and I I definitely will uh stand for Liberal Arts like I uh like I think like a more than a quarter of liberal of like Fortune 500 CEOs and stuff are like liberal arts Majors it's one of the more common things and obviously it's a great Pathway to to working in uh law uh and ultimately in work working in any kind of creative field I think but at the same time it's not immediately clear what you do with a LS degree when you graduate most people just go to graduate school which is what I did um and I think the notion that like if people already had some skill that they could go and sell on the market and then they could decide what to do and they could pursue an actual field that they're interested in instead of just going into one of the you know highest like they look at like us news and World Report what are the highest paid majors and then they they basically make decisions around that because everything is about covering your initial cost and and potentially especially if you're coming from overseas and you're flying to the United States and you're getting like a student visa and all that stuff how in the world am I gon to make this worth it because my like two generations saved up money to be able to eventually send me to the US to get a degree right so so people basically have this economic imperative you have no idea how bad that is getting and the United States high red economy is driven by U student visas and uh they're not the deal that they want were we we can uh we can talk about that if you like it's kind of scary let's just talk about it now this is a field near and dear to something else you said in that you there was something oh the liberal arts okay let me say one thing and then we'll talk about International students let's talk about let's talk about liberal arts first think about this you went through that whole liberal arts thing think about this you come out of college as a professional programmer and now you're going to a liberal Art School but you need some spending money do you spend the next four years while you're taking cool Li large classes making coffee or flipping burgers or standing at a McDonald's drivethru or do you work as a remote worker parttime 20 hours a week riding software for companies and making instead of minimum wage you're making 20 hours a week you're making $30,000 a year cash and you're learning like crazy at the same time as you're teaching taking classes like comparative Shakespearean literature which is fun as heck when you're 22 years old right yeah and so think of not just the time you're in class in the liberal arts but think of what you're doing to make money while you're in the liberal arts degree you're learning on the job to become even better software Developers for that four years that you're in Liberal Arts because you're not working as a barista I'm saying but it doesn't mean you can't work as a barista it just means that you don't have to work as a barista you'd be surprised I'm from the University of Michigan right it's the Ivory Tower everybody at the University of Michigan is insanely wealthy and they have like you know drivers to take them to class wrong people at the University of Michigan in the undergrad when we post an undergraduate position at the University of Michigan people line up out the door and that's because some of the students undergrads are wealthy from the east coast and some are not and we have to educate everybody we can't just say well we're a we're a Midwest ivy league like school and so we're going to only wait until rich people show up and the answer is no we have lots of nonrich people and I think about if those students at the University of Michigan could be making good money because they really need survival money I'm not talking about International students now I'm talking about you know students from the state of Michigan going to the University of Michigan to get the best education you can get in that state they can't afford to eat they're hungry and we we don't we just assume that everybody at Princeton or Michigan or whatever can afford to eat and it's not a good assumption so that's why I want people to have employable skills before they come to college so they have the freedom to take a place like the University of Michigan or Princeton and see some really weird course about International economy and say you know what I want to take five more courses about International economy and I can because I'm making a decent living I mean I went to college making a living because I worked at the University fulltime so I had benefits I had money I had an apartment I had a family and I was going to school for a long time but it was so fun to go to school and not have to work at a coffee shop 20 hours a week at 2 o'clock in the morning taken away from my education okay yeah so let's talk about International students so the problem with higher education right now and and and everyone like since 1990 has basically said that higher education is is running towards a brick wall something bad's going to happen and I'm like that's not right that's not right that's not right that's not right and most of the things that they're saying is like well if you can learn something on YouTube therefore you don't need to go to school but what people don't quite understand is the purpose of an undergraduate education is not to learn anything but it's to grow up and become an awesome person and and learn to meet people your high school and your family are all kind of homogeneous and when you go to college it's people all over the world and you learn so many things when you first go to college and meet so many people that prepares you for the world that's not exactly the same as the high school that you went to yeah right and so it's important in high school to kind of not overc confuse our our young people people let them learn math and algebra and Python and hardware and C just focus in that little world and then their their minds expand and and and so the the key to a undergraduate education is mostly to grow up but then we talk about graduate education and graduate education is where we have a lot of uh foreign students and they're it's very lucrative you mentioned people save up for two generations to send one child to America so that they can get US citizenship through an H1B and their great grandchildren or greatgrandchildren can be US citizens and it's a beautiful story right the problem is that with the last two years of turndown in the tech economy and we can talk a bit about the turndown in Tech economy if you like why I think that is but with the turn down in Tech economy our graduate students who are not US citizens are are encountering uh job posting after job posting after job posting that in not so many words says foreign people need not apply have you heard that I know some people that have been going through the H1B struggle uh I know people that have been almost like kind of forced out of their employers just because like that it's cheaper to hire because it cost it the employer has to support you in your H1B effort and that cost money money and when you have a whole bunch of US citizens just walking around unemployed with lots of skills not bad people why bother going through the H1B fuss if you don't have to so these companies slowly but surely want HR decision at a Time start taking H1B off the table and as long as they take H1B off the table and they get away with it and there's enough people in the economy and enough you know citizens can be hired you pretty much make it so that it's really difficult for a noncitizen to get a job and then get H1B and then become a citizen so that their children can be US citizens which is what two generations in their home country went through yeah the beneficiary of up until two years ago of that was places like the University of Michigan that can command a high premium but really what we're selling is h1bs right the students that come to us are super talented already they have a whole bachelor's degree in computer science and they're super talented we throw a couple years of master's degree charge them outstate tuition and then you know dump them off into the H1B process and then you know that if you after you graduate if you don't have a job within 60 days you literally have to get on a plane and go home back to that family that save two generations to get you here it is not going to take long at all for for people to realize that that's becoming a very bad investment right I'm saying the quiet part out loud right and so the question becomes the United States has benefited greatly from all these brilliant people coming here and making their whole life sacrifice to be here and to help us and to make our economy better and make us the most creative and productive tech place in the world but if we're going to shut them off at the border things are going to change and universities Revenue are going to I mean I'm talking now about top ones you know the michigans the Harvard's it's not it's if if the international student population stops coming it's not like we can't fill up and do instate master's degrees we'll always have people it's just a massive amount of Revenue that we make from that will go away and honestly that's the to me as a higher ed person that to me is the quiet part out loud about the danger of the next 10 years and you might well guas that I also have a solution to that yeah well let's hear let's let's hear your prop think about well my proposed solution is um is we've got to start creating uh education high quality education that can be delivered online at scale to all corners of the world at a reasonable cost so let's just say at the University of Michigan and by the way I'm just making this up no one's agreed to this yet we make a master programmer certificate and instead of costing $35,000 it costs 3,000 and instead of 300 students we have 10,000 students but you don't have to come to United States and at the end of this not only are you programmer but we have an internship we we hook you up with jobs we hook you up with open source um and I can educate let's just say 6 to 8,000 people every year sitting in my comfy Ann Arbor going to my favorite restaurants and they don't have to come to the United States and they don't need two generations of savings to get here and we can still make money on that right we can still make money on that now here's the problem I have been in educational technology software for last 25 years and I will just say that all the software that's ever been built in educational technology is not suitable to achieve what I just described corera software is bad edx is bad Saka is bad moodle's bad canvas is bad I'm going to guess if I look closely at your stuff it's bad meaning it's just kind of like hacked up to face the moment and I think that in order to build this the first thing we got to do is build really really good education technology software I mean stuff that that is Eclipse is what Corsair is trying to do and eclipse is what edex is trying to do and eclipse what canvas is trying to do even these are all billion dollar companies right but they don't care because they're making a billion dollars they don't want to make a better piece of software they just want to keep selling the same crappy software that they've been selling so that's my solution and my solution prere requires building an entire new generation of educational technology that has not been seen on this planet yet and you think 30 years later from the mid 90s to today they've been building these things called Learning Management Systems you'd think they' have made some progress they made progress making money that's one way to put it uh ruining people they made progress making money and ruining people's privacy stealing their data don't get me started on privacy okay well I won't get you started on privacy cuz uh there's already so much to unpack there uh like obviously we feel very strongly about privacy I'm very proud to say if you go to free Cod Camp SL settings you scroll to the bottom you can delete your account and all data we have on you permanently there's no way back like we literally just delete it and there's a backup that will get deleted after like a week right so like there's no path to reclaiming your data uh and we we make it trivial there's like one are you sure yes it's done um and the other thing you could uh you could add a add a thing to that where you say look I want you to Auto delete my data after two years yeah and so there's this kind of like rolling thing like and if I'm gone two years it's just all gone right and I make it so I can extend it if I want right you send me a note to say hey it's uh it's June we're doing our annual dat a clean up I'm going to clean your data up unless you come and click this button to extend it another another year the button I can extend which means that it's like a dead man switch on a train right where it and I stole this from python anywhere by the way they give a thing say your site's going away but all you gotta do is click this button and you got another three months right and um and so a privacy perspective the key thing is auto expiring data right it's not just getting rid of it which I like that and that's good for furpa and good for all the Privacy standards but Auto expiring data and and the key to Auto expiring data not that free code Camp uh is subject to this but a commercial company should also Auto expire data because that commercial company could be sold 10 years from now so if I use some commercial company to do homework and I upload my stuff to this and my teacher grades it on this uploaded thing yeah um and that company 10 years later gets sold to say a Chinese company and they didn't Auto expire my data but I long ago forgot about it and I really don't care if it exists or not and then my homework is in China right not good not good and so that's where we got to learn Auto expire data so I zoom at the University of Michigan we've got to configured to Auto expire data after like 18 months or something and I'm always getting like emails from Zoom saying we're about to delete your data from from 18 months ago and I'm like I'm so happy when I see that email like yes that's what I want just I don't whatever that was I don't care about it I mean it was important 18 months ago I was like a office hours or a lecture or something but it's 18 months old actively delete my stuff yeah yeah for us like because people rely on these certifications that we put like and we track like all the work that they've done and we want to be able to have like a forensic chain of like in case there's ever academic dishonesty accusations or something like that yep uh but but this is definitely something that I'm thinking like you got my wheels turning I hadn't even really thought about that I think like from to extend and if they want to keep it for 20 years keep it for 20 years I mean so many of our emails end up in Gmail spam box anyway that I am kind of worried that a lot of people would be like I never got the email and all my data is gone and then we'd be spending a whole lot of support time trying to explain to people sorry we really can't get your data back like I'm sorry this went to spam uh like with my email newsletter I just C my EMA newsletter from 7 million people down to you know less than 100 thousand people and the way I did that was I sent out an email and said hey if you're enjoying this email and you want to keep getting it please click like fill out this form real quick like it's like just confirm basically uh and uh and yeah like a whole lot of people were probably it was showing up in their spam box or they were just like you know filtering it out oh I get to this someday maybe you know but um but the result is fewer people are getting the email but it's the people who really want it so I do like this this notion uh there's so many things we could talk about about privacy like again like I'm a huge believer in respecting people's privacy and asking for the bare minimum information all you need for a free Camp account is like literally an email it can be a fake email we're not going to stop you from using five minute mail or whatever but you're not going to be able to off after that because we don't use passwords because passwords are a huge security thing so we we do like basically we use uh onetime pins to get into your account for example so so like we're thinking about all these things but I I want to get back to what you said because I think it's worth noting like a lot of people may not know what Sakai is but you mentioned you you mentioned like you know Sakai is probably not like good enough uh you know of course there are all these other companies and you mentioned you know free C Camp of course we're actively working to improve and to build a more general purpose uh you know validation environment to like be able to validate that people have actually completed assignments and being able to test different things but Sakai is your own project so I just want to point out like if people haven't heard of that the humility uh in you mentioning that you know that your own stuff is not good enough either and that you're working on it can you talk about Sakai real quick absolutely Sakai is an open source learning management system competing with Blackboard Moodle canvas and desire to learn uh as an Enterprise learning management system and uh we we were founded in uh 2004 and we end up peing at about a 6% worldwide market share in like 200 eight and we've been syncing ever since uh canvas basically is the current market leader in this space and they stole all our ideas and they stole all the standards that I helped build there's the standards the IMs learning tools interoperability ring of Appliance canvas is on there but they changed their logo since I put the tattoo on um and and what happened uh that makes why Sakai doesn't have a 6% or even 100% market share is that uh University's it organizations have given up on the notion of protecting student privacy and they just want a cloud provider that they like Google or Facebook that's going to make it so they don't have to worry about the software Sakai is open source software and so there's some worry involved in it that you got to run servers if it goes down if there's a bug that needs fixing you got to kind of go fix it whereas if you just Outsource to a cloud provider like canvas you you um don't have to think about it I mean our canvas was down for 3 Days the be beginning of the semester and the IT people were just cool as a cucumber because it's like it down but it's not my problem right it's very secure if they were running sakay at that same point in time they would be people on site 24 hours a day you know and so it the it organizations of these colleges are making convenience choices for the it organization that are completely compromising the student privacy and so Sakai is a competent piece of software that's on par with all these other ones the difference is is Sakai is not purely a cloud offering Blackboard canvas desired to learn is purely a cloud offering mood and Sakai are open source which means you can as a school keep the data in your own hands rather than just give it to a company that could be sold on a whim any day you wake up in the morning and you got a contract with them that says you'll be notified when they're sold and the answer is yep you'll be notified when they're sold but your data is gone by noon and you're like well I'm going to sue you for that and the answer is yep you sue but by then the money's all gone and it's all it's whatever so thing really annoys me about uh learning management system Marketplace is that it organizations are making decisions based on their staffs and Ci's convenience and they are making a powerful choice that is the wrong choice for their students privacy yeah they are handing that data off to third parties without even telling the student that their homework assignment on human sexuality is in the hands of a private company that could be sold anytime because if they express it that way the students be like I'm not going to turn my homework in anymore but they don't express it that way right they're like and it's it people that are like got their motivations all screwed up because they don't have talented people in it anymore so that's Sakai sakai's awesome but the the key thing that why I say Sakai I need to Beyond Sakai I need to Beyond corsera I need to Beyond edx and it has to do with that high school thing we talked about because what you are not capable doing with free code camp and what Sakai is not really capable of doing is also being a publisher into other people's Learning Management Systems of content people have to come to free code Camp they experience it on free code camp but what if a high school in Singapore wanted to take a course from free code camp and teach it on their system not just tell all the kids go log into free code Camp show me your certificate when you're you're done I'll give you a grade no no no no no it needs to be resources like a publisher like Pearson and Pearson my math lab Etc like what they would do what Pearson did with my math lab is they plug it into whatever school from ninth from seventh grade to PhD they plug it into wherever you're at and nothing including Sakai and what you've written does that and so we need to think like a publisher and so that's why I need to build a whole new generation of these things that look much like learning management systems but also function as publisher systems and so the problem is is we've gotten we've sort of just gone off into this like teach a course teach a course teach a course but we haven't thought so much about authoring and reuse modification and sharing courses because College professors don't want to think about teaching until August 27th and then on May 15th they want to stop thinking about teaching and so it's it's okay so but we need a whole new generation of software yeah which I'm working on awesome yeah and and uh I'm excited about this because again you're you're correct like free Cod camp like technically it's open source any University Professor or any uh you know admin at uh High School could just spin up a local version of free Coke game or even just white label and have it be like you know charger High um computer science program and it could basically be free Cod Camp running and that's totally fine that's within the terms of free C Camp is open source we use the bstd 3 license which is extremely permissive uh the only restriction that BSD has three has that MIT doesn't have is you can't pretend that you're free C Camp and that's for obvious reasons because we don't want people like capitalizing on our good open folks are very protective of trademarks and that's appropriate yeah yeah and we have Ironclad trademark here in the US and uh and other municipalities as well municipalities other other regions uh because we don't want scammers to pretend they're free go camp and rip people off yeah yeah yeah uh so wow uh like talking about higher education uh what would your advice be to a learner who's in India because we have a lot of people in like free C Camp's Community the way to look at it is like America is by far the biggest segment of people who use free code Camp the United States specifically then we have um India is second and then we have uh Brazil Nigeria uh and then like Europe if you want to look at like the EU area and and the UK like that would be kind of like the the there's a lot of people over there that use it too but but like India is huge and you just got back from India you flew over there my understanding is you went to like 10 different universities like some Whirlwind tour can you talk about what that was like and then uh my main goal is to like understand what that was like but also to understand for Indian people that are watching this who are thinking about traveling to the US to get a master's degree like what they should consider doing or or people who are hoping to send their kids to the US to get a master's degree like you are an authority on computer science education and like I would you know presume also International students coming to the US to try to study computer science and get hb1 BS and work as software Engineers like you know a lot more about that than I do so first off my twoe trip to India was I got to feel like what it was like to be a celebrity in a real tiny little narrow world of computer science and that I was treated very well and uh you know people were applauding and there was standing room only rooms with 3,000 people in it and so and cars would take me places and food and airplane flights not private jets or anything but we just it was just fun to kind of be a celebrity um so I think and I actually think Quincy you are way ahead of the curve on this particular topic um you may or may not know that you're ahead of the curve on this particular topic but I I'll tell you what I envisioned 10 years from now and then what I'm going to try to put into place is we have historically thought of India as a place where um you can kind of Outsource stuff but you can't trust them you got to you know you know and then you hire someone in India to hire the people in India and then you're still not happy because you think I can't hire people directly in India and like what how would that work and and so there's been this kind of like Outsourcing business where all the Indian computer scientists work for companies who then resell them to United States to do kind of crap work right the work we just don't want to do and that's complet completely the wrong model that's completely the wrong model the other alternative is you save for two generations you come to United States and then you go work in Silicon Valley that's also completely the wrong model here's what the right model is the right model is that people who live in India like living in India their families are there their food is there they just like that people love India it's a great place to live you know it's a great place to raise a family it's there's lots of things about the Indian culture that you know that are just unnatural you know and when they come to America it's unnatural so how can't we come up with a scheme by which given what we learned in the pandemic about remote work can't we come up with a scheme by which companies simply directly hire Indian individuals and make them just part of the team and in doing so they pay them probably a quarter of the amount of money they'd have to pay them to live in Silicon Valley they live with their in their culture they enjoy their culture they're within their culture they're very well paid and then you just treat them like any other employee right and I I see you're nodding because you're already doing this and I know you are already doing this we have lots of teams from South team members from South Asia but they're not hidden behind some kind of like firewall of a of a consulting company right they're just people on your team that happen to show up in Zoom like everybody else shows up in Zoom right yeah and you know them and you get to grow and care for them now then imagine for a moment that you were a bigger company and you could afford to fly him to the United States for a while and you know have like a company Retreat and take all your Indian employees and your Singapore employees and bring everybody United States and so that they could enjoy United States they could get to know it they could like eat our food and then we they'd be like oh your food's no good I want to go home and eat really good food in my country right and so we got to get to the point where we the United States companies and organizations can benefit from this amazing pool of talent but without hiding behind like the contractors right they're just employees and we've learned to use zoom since 2020 we know it and so like you I have an Indian employee I figured out how taxes work I figured out how to write paychecks to Indian people and it's easy and it's great and there's companies that make it really really easy for a US organization to hire someone directly in India and then you become they're just another employee and you again locality post pandemic locality is less and less of an issue if we could fix it so that they could come on a tourist visa or a business visa for two weeks and enjoy meeting them in person so when I went to India I met my employee in person because it just turned out that he lives in one of the cities that I was in so I met him and he's doing really well I don't pay him nearly as much as I would pay a US employee and yet he is upper middle class where he lives right he's paying debts off and living a good life and and whatever and it's costing me not nearly as much money it would cause to have the same talent in the United States so what do we need to have that happen well it would be great if we had an educational system that at the end of their education they had some internships and the internships were Global and distributed and there was an organization that mediated all this so that maybe you know there would be like a kind of a code camp where you know people all over the world would participate in this posteducation camp where they're learning to work with people they're learning to work on professional software there's workshops there is internships there is connection between employers and employees there is funds from nonprofits to this hypothetical organization that creates free camplike experiences around the world for technologists and we just like scale the crap out of that I mean does that sound like an okay thing yeah I think that'd be amazing uh I mean if it involves interfacing with the US government you're the closest to it right that's why the name of your company free code Camp about togetherness not just like free education but it's about togetherness yeah yeah I mean anything that interfaces with the US government and the Visa system like I used to be a School director and I worked for like this big Japanese conglomerate we had schools I ran a school in China I ran schools here in the United States and it was such an ordeal even with this giant corporation that was really old um like 50 60 years old uh that had all these connections with like the state department and had like this entire team that understood like government relations and all this stuff like it was an ordeal to be able to get people to come to the US uh and what you just said earlier about like flying are Indian team members uh we have uh a team member in India we have two in Bangladesh we have one in Pakistan uh and then we have like 21 different countries are represented on the freeo camp team 36 people 21 different countries right um it is an ordeal to get even a tourist visa to get people like uh mesh uh who who's like basically the head of like all of our infrastructure he's kind of the equivalent of the CTO at free C Camp right he has been waiting for like a year to get his visa interview so hopefully he'll be able to come next year right uh but it's just it's a lot of paperwork and I don't really have the heart for it to be completely Ked like as much as I would like to bring people together I I I'm not the right person to do that but maybe there could be a charity that's focused on that that we could potentially partner with uh yeah I I'm talking about things 10 years I'm not talking about you got to do it next week right we know it's hard right yeah but we've got to lay down path in front of us that eventually leads to that as a natural thing right you know we're doing what we can do right now um I think the thing we got to work on in the short term is distributed scalable internships that's but the problem with that is that uh students have to have enough talent to be worthy of that because you can't just say I don't know anything about programming I'm a TR truck driver why don't I start with an internship and the answer is you will be ejected from that internship at at a very high velocity right because you're useless yeah mentoring only happens when you have skills it doesn't happen because you want skills it happens because you have skills and so our job yours and mine is to create a curriculum where they get the skills so that when they're sort of nominated for an internship people go like o yummy that's the kind of skills I could use at a very low cost and it's all taken care of by whatever and now I can get them to work on my project and and and and oh in a year I'm going to just hire them anyway so away we go and so that to me is the thing is it's not just let's do internships let's not just have free code camps around fires around the world if there's no skills involved you know and nontrivial skills right this is the back to the master programmer so for me the master programmer is the prerequisite to entry into internships because I don't like mentoring people who have no skills I've just not going to do it yeah and the reason why these internships are so selective in like Silicon Valley and the reason why they are so remunerative is is a twofold reason from the way I understand one they want to identify the best talent before they even bring them in they want to make sure they're actually going to be able to productively get things done and it's also like kind of a cheap pipeline for identifying talent that they can bring on cuz like most of the people I know they got an internship at Google or Microsoft or like a big tech company they also at the end of that internship got extended like a job offer and then they could join that was that was basically like corporate training for being able to join their company it's kind of the equivalent of going through like an employ employee boot camp almost being an intern and I agree internships are great because they're paid and uh they can they work within the US framework of visas and I know we're talking about letting people stay in their home country and not having to go through this you know naturalization process my wife went through that naturalization process by the way uh we met when I was in grad school in China uh in tingan uh and uh she eventually you know came to the US got a green card worked here for many years and uh was able to naturalize as a US citizen but like it was it was a big ordeal and you know apart from reforming the immigration system which we don't talk a lot about political things on uh the free C Camp podcast but like I'm I'm a huge believer in making it much easier for skilled immigrants to come to this country uh and I'm I'm very vocal about that I'm not I'm not going to put you on the spot and see what you think about immigration or anything like that but like apart from making it easier for talented people to come and work and contribute to the economic activity help us build up the tech ecosystem here in the United States pay taxes uh all of those things uh I do love the idea of just making it easier for people to get promising internships and helping more companies realize that internships are a path forward and that they can actually get really talented internships so that like even small businesses could potentially have interns that have a certain Baseline of skills who can come on board and there's an independent Arbiter of those skills right now the Arbiters of those skills are like Linux Foundation CompTIA and of course University degree programs whom it sounds like you would say those degree programs like computer sized programs are not sufficiently robust in uh helping sort people who are ready for an internship from people who just coasted through a CS program and aren't even that passionate about it just went because their parents pushed them to go to CS because it's a remunerative degree program right yeah I just I think that the Cs has kind of been lazy in their curriculum because it doesn't matter what they teach because you know they teach you know 80% of it is a waste and 20% of it is good and then I think you and I could teach the 20% without the 80% and achieve the same result yeah I mean from an from an immigration perspective what if the demand isn't there and United States and we just can't assume that the it's been demand has been infinite for kind of for 35 or 40 years for new software developers because that's the that's the crash in the software industry right and now and so let me just and I got to go to my flying lesson in a little bit you're looking at the clock and I'm looking at I got to go to my flying lesson bit um the reason in my opinion for the crash in the tech industry and the reason it's not going to recover is simple in 2006 Google needed to build a low latency distributed file system a thing that had never been invented and never been built that could have like 11 copies of your data and have 12 nines of reliability and so in 2006 they needed 5,000 software developers to solve that extremely difficult problem properly what problem and then they had to do like big table and then they used page Rank and then they did this and they did that the question if you look at Amazon let's just say you're the CTO of Amazon right now what are the five most important strategic innovations that Amazon needs to do right now in terms of its infrastructure and whatever can you think of anything that Amazon even needs to do that would require a thousand people technology wise I mean I have a limited you know uh view into like what their daytoday I mean if they if they're going to be serious about drone delivery maybe that would be an area like that they would need to invest a but I I can't really think anything off the top of my head how about we invent a technology that makes it so robots can do Pick and Pull in large warehouses so that we can more efficiently fill trucks up so people can get stuff in one day instead of two days why don't why don't we hire a bunch of people to figure out that robot technology oh wait it's already done right so that's the problem right you look at the things that Amazon Google Facebook Twitter and you look at what they've accomplished so far you they have a achieved a lot and then un yet as as yet unachieved things are way smaller in 2024 than they were in 2012 or 2006 so we shouldn't expect that whatever the number of software developers Amazon needs that is now shrunk is going to get big again that's not saying it's zero right because drone delivery and who knows what else right you know but man there has been a lot of technology achievement in the last 20 years and these guys have products and systems and trucks and people and that stuff works and you don't need to invent a new thing right Maps worldwide accurate Maps solved I'm not saying it doesn't need any software developers it just doesn't need tens of thousands of software developers so that notion if you think about why we needed an H1B and I'm not anti H1B I'm just looking at the things that lead to the lack of demand the reduced demand that I think is permanent now that doesn't mean that we don't that we don't need any programmers we just don't need the kinds of people with a PhD in computer science that they needed at Google in 2010 it's never coming back and so what you and I need to do is we need to educate a populace for the things the market actually wants in 2024 not pretend that it's still 2010 yeah and so we think about how does that work and that gets us back a bit to the the problems that really are important our people problems and the technical problems are getting easier and easier so if we kind of start teaching technical stuff in high school and letting people take liberal arts degrees and work great with people and create wonderful distributed teams to solve whatever human problem we need to solve that is the humans will always want a new thing right they'll they'll want a new Uber like thing and that's going to take some work but the human problems are as important as the technology problems if you're starting a company like uber so yeah how many minutes do you have before your flight lesson I want to make sure you make that and uh but I I do have like a ton of additional questions we got about five more minutes okay I'm just gonna fire these more minutes fire these off first of all you're doing you're doing flight this is this is like a soft question but you also in addition to flying planes you race cars what's the story behind that I do race cars um well I just I just like um I like I like very organic racing local racing I don't like F1 or NASCAR anything like that uh what I really like doing is driving fast around a track in a track prepared car so that when I so I don't have to speed to get my jollies on entrance ramps to to highways and so can afford I race in this thing called the 24 hours of lemons which is supposedly a $500 car that races a 16hour endurance race but it just lets me get my excitement out of my system with uh without having to be highly testosterone so I'm not a I'm like I have a five on my race car my racing team I am either the worst or the second tourist racer meaning in terms of you look at the times my times are terrible compared to my brother and my NE you and but we don't care because we're not trying to win we're just trying to really enjoy the day and drive around the track so it's just it's a very fun hobby we like preparing the cars and building them and uh and so that's where the racing hobby comes in awesome uh well we didn't even have time to talk about AI uh if I know you've answered this question like repeatedly when you were traveling through India and probably a whole lot since then but if you had just like a one minute answer to why people shouldn't be worried specifically about AI as programmers but you know all the other things that you mentioned that they should be worried about what would be like I was asked the question of why take any classes when AI is going to solve every problem yeah and I in a space of 14 days I gave the same talk over and over and over again and answer that question over and over and over again and as I was experiencing all the other things I was refining the answer to that question so I got to the point in the second to last one where I came up with an answer that that silenced the whole room right they're like why should I learn to program with AI and it happened because they were giving me a tour at the lovely professional University in Northern India and they were showing me people working on drones building new drones and I walked into that room and these young people were showing me their drones and the thing that was going off in my head is like aren't drones a solved problem I can go to Best Buy and buy a drone and I go like and it just drives around are drones a solve problem and then I started thinking about this because I'm old enough to remember when we first started hearing about quadcopters and Ai and WiFi and coordination of them and I remember seeing videos of like person starting up a quadcopter and it like crash they got nets all around it and it crashes into the the wall and breaks into a million pieces and they make another quadcopter and I'm thinking like there was a time when we the world did not know how to make quadcopters so here's what I'm telling you to do let's just say quadcopters were not in existence in 2000 so what I want you to do is I want you to grab uh all the Nvidia processors you want um and I want you to put those in a suitcase and grab all the like AI Wizards that you can grab software developers and stuff and I want you to time travel back to 2000 and I want you to arrive in 2000 and you plug Invidia processors in you plug the internet in and you say llm read everything in the world today and so we take an llm back to 2000 and the LM reads everything in 2000 and the llm finally comes up like in hit trer Guide to the Galaxy the hit llm comes up and the people gather and we're going to ask it one question and that is I am interested in building a quadcopter that's automatically selfleveling that uses WiFi to find its way WiFi existed in 2000 uses WiFi to find its way around and I want to hold a thing in my hand and drive it around that AI the the perfect Genius of all Humanity's future has no data in 2000 to invent a quad copper nothing it's like uh what's a quadcopter right that's it that's all you get from it and so we're excited about the fact that it's looking backwards in time at already solved problems and it can regurgitate the already solved problems with a little remixing a bit and we're like that's the future and the answer is no that's not the future the future is things we can't even conceive of so AI doesn't help us with the things we can't conceive of it does help us with the things that are passed it's really good search engine and I love it I mean it's great I use it all the time but to say that there is no need for futur looking creativity or any kind of research because AI is going to do it for us the answer is no it's not it's terrible at looking forward it really is terrible at looking forward it's great at looking back so there's that that's the AI thing and when I said that finally I'm they like oh yeah they right it can't know things that it's not been told yeah yeah I mean that's very much my sentiment like it's great I use it almost like as a replacement for Google in some situations like if I have a longtail query that Google's I know I'm just going to get gibberish on Google I'll go and ask it and it does a decent job uh or if I needed to make it like really specific associations like with language learning stuff it's super useful I really appreciate your time sharing these insights uh sharing the reassurance that people are still going to need to learn programming people are still going to need to have domain expertise people are still going to need to do all the things they're doing today even though we have this tool that makes it much easier to synthesize past knowledge it's not going to create new knowledge right I mean it may be able to do very specific things like go out and try all these novel combinations of you know like for drug Discovery for example I think I that it's got a lot of potential in that area but it's not going to be able to do anything you don't really tell it to do within like a kind of a bounded space so thank you again for your Time Dr Chuck it's been an absolute honor having you on the podcast this is you've been on my list of guests to have for literally years at this point and uh I'm I'm very excited to meet with you hopefully talk with you some more about the future of higher education uh practical kind of like vocational programming education uh so uh is there any message you want to leave people with before we sign off I I think uh the importance of fre code C Camp is going to go up not down I mean I think that there are things about your model that are more scalable and sustainable than any other model for educating the world thank you I'm gon to incorporate as much of your feedback as possible and we're going to keep this momentum going that we have with the free C Camp Community thanks again for all your support for all your uh thoughtful feedback over the years and for creating these amazing free learning resources many of which we're publishing on fre C Camp so be sure to check the show notes and you can you can see some of Dr Chuck's amazing coursework I'll also include links to some of your various websites thanks again Dr Chuck thank you Quincy and until next week everybody happy coding cheers
