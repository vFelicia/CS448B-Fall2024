00:00 - what's going on my name is jay and in
00:02 - this video i want to show you how you
00:04 - can use a public api
00:07 - so let's see
00:08 - so for this video we're going to be
00:10 - using
00:11 - openweathermap.org they have a very very
00:14 - simple api they have a ton of data that
00:16 - we can use
00:17 - so if you go there and then you click
00:20 - api you will see all these options right
00:22 - here but the one that i want is this one
00:26 - the first one the current weather data
00:28 - that's the one that i want
00:30 - okay so click subscribe
00:33 - you will see all these options
00:35 - um the one that we're gonna use is the
00:37 - free version which is gonna work for
00:39 - this video and it works for like a
00:41 - personal website and stuff like that
00:43 - so click on the get api key and start so
00:46 - you need to sign up just like a normal
00:49 - website just your email and password and
00:51 - all that stuff and they're gonna give
00:53 - you an api key
00:56 - um
00:57 - so that way you can request all that
00:59 - data so
01:01 - let's test the
01:04 - api so let's see if it works i have here
01:07 - the url that they provide
01:11 - which is
01:13 - this one right here
01:15 - all right
01:16 - so now we need to add question mark q
01:19 - equals to whatever city and you can see
01:22 - that i have it already there so i live
01:25 - in orlando so it's orlando and then and
01:29 - app app id
01:31 - equals to whatever
01:33 - api key they gave you
01:36 - all right so that's mine
01:38 - don't try to use mine because it's not
01:40 - gonna work for you i'm gonna hit enter
01:45 - and here you go
01:46 - so i have
01:48 - all the data from the current weather
01:52 - in orlando which is great
01:55 - one thing that i want to do right now is
01:57 - because if you can see here on
01:59 - temperature
02:01 - that's uh it's a different unit
02:03 - we use a different unit so i'm just
02:05 - gonna put it right here after this and
02:09 - so it's going to be unit
02:11 - equals to imperial
02:15 - and then
02:16 - end
02:18 - and i'm going to leave the app id so i'm
02:19 - going to hit enter again
02:23 - and now we have
02:25 - whatever
02:27 - you use
02:28 - you can
02:29 - change it but this is what we use in the
02:31 - united states
02:32 - cool
02:34 - now that we have this url ready to go
02:37 - i'm just going to go to my text editor
02:38 - and start coding
02:41 - here i have an html file the only thing
02:44 - i have is
02:45 - i'm requesting jquery we're gonna we're
02:48 - gonna use it to request the
02:50 - data we have a script
02:53 - dot dis which is empty
02:56 - and we have a style dot css it's empty
02:59 - we're going to add some stuff in a
03:00 - minute so let's start by adding some
03:04 - html here
03:06 - so the first thing i'm gonna do i'm
03:08 - gonna add a container everything's gonna
03:10 - be inside that container so it can be
03:12 - like
03:12 - weather container
03:16 - okay and inside there we can do
03:19 - a paragraph and then we can add like a
03:22 - class of
03:24 - um this can be
03:26 - actually you know what first i'm gonna
03:28 - add an icon
03:30 - like if it's raining
03:33 - if it's raining we can do like a rain
03:36 - cloud
03:37 - with some drops or whatever if it's
03:40 - sunny we can add
03:43 - you know a sun
03:44 - or something like that so that's the
03:46 - icon let's
03:48 - put icon as a class
03:50 - this is going to be like the name so if
03:52 - it's raining it's going to be like rain
03:54 - if it's sunny it's going to be sunny
03:57 - so this is we can name it name it um i
03:59 - don't know whether
04:01 - whatever
04:02 - you can name it whatever you want
04:05 - so let's create another one and this one
04:09 - is going to be the temperature of course
04:12 - tank
04:14 - all right cool i think that's
04:16 - all we need for now i like if i want the
04:18 - weather i just want like you know
04:21 - whatever is happening in the and the
04:23 - temperature and then the icon is
04:25 - something cool you know that we'd like
04:27 - to see
04:28 - all right so that's it for the html i'm
04:31 - gonna save it
04:33 - and then for the javascript
04:35 - let's go here
04:37 - because we have jquery we can use
04:39 - something called get json and get json
04:43 - is going to get all this data for us
04:45 - because this is
04:47 - json this is json file
04:51 - so let's go back there and let's do
04:53 - dollar sign dot get json
04:57 - just like this
05:00 - and then we're gonna do
05:02 - inside here
05:04 - we're gonna do the url coma and then
05:06 - function
05:08 - sorry
05:10 - function
05:12 - just like that
05:13 - all right
05:15 - so we need to include that url here
05:17 - let's go back and
05:18 - get it where is it here it is
05:22 - copy
05:25 - and paste it right there
05:27 - all right
05:29 - so what i'm going to do i'm going to put
05:31 - here
05:32 - inside the function
05:34 - i'm going to put
05:35 - data
05:36 - all the data is going to be inside there
05:38 - so i can do something like
05:42 - console.log
05:46 - data
05:48 - so i'm going to save that
05:51 - and let's go back here
05:53 - so this is my page right now i'm gonna
05:56 - reload my page
06:00 - and here you go
06:02 - we can see all the data the same thing
06:05 - we have here we can see it we have it
06:07 - now available for us on the website
06:12 - everything is here
06:14 - all right cool now that that's working
06:17 - let's go back
06:21 - and here inside the function
06:24 - we're gonna do like let's create the
06:27 - variable of the icon so let's do
06:29 - variable icon
06:32 - and i have a url that they provided
06:36 - for everyone to get
06:38 - the icon so if we go here let's see if
06:41 - they have here
06:44 - on
06:46 - weather so you can see that um there is
06:50 - a icon here and there is like a number
06:52 - in the letter
06:54 - you don't understand how we're going to
06:56 - use this in a minute
06:57 - so they provided a url for that icon so
07:01 - let's see
07:02 - let's open here
07:05 - and let's go back
07:08 - and what was the code is what 11d let's
07:11 - copy and paste it
07:13 - dot
07:14 - png look at this
07:18 - so
07:20 - every single thing
07:23 - is a different thing depending on the
07:25 - weather the icon is going to change
07:28 - and it's going to be this url
07:30 - cool so let's go back to
07:33 - my code
07:34 - let's do
07:38 - oops that's not what i want
07:40 - i want the url
07:44 - which is this
07:49 - and then i'm going to do plus
07:52 - and we need to add
07:55 - um that
07:56 - code which is going to be data dot
08:01 - let's go here let's see
08:05 - so it's data
08:07 - dot weather
08:09 - 0
08:11 - and then dot icon
08:13 - so it's data
08:15 - dot weather
08:18 - zero
08:19 - and this is because it's an array it's a
08:21 - list
08:22 - you can see that we have
08:24 - oops
08:25 - quit
08:26 - we have um
08:28 - zero one and it's an array
08:31 - so we need to do
08:33 - uh square bracket zero and then dot icon
08:39 - that's it now we're gonna have if we
08:42 - call icon we're gonna have this
08:44 - and then whatever code it is
08:48 - and actually i need to add the png file
08:50 - so the png format so let's go
08:53 - plus sign and dot png
08:56 - now that's gonna work
08:58 - there you go
09:00 - so now let me call the icon
09:03 - and see if it works
09:06 - console.log
09:09 - icon
09:12 - all right let's go back let's reload
09:14 - this page
09:15 - here it is
09:17 - just click on it and that's it we have
09:19 - the icon all right
09:22 - so let's go back here
09:26 - so that's working let's remove
09:27 - console.log we don't need it
09:32 - and now what i'm going to do is
09:35 - i want to add
09:36 - that icon
09:38 - inside this image
09:40 - so let's do
09:42 - dollar sign
09:44 - we can get that
09:46 - the icon class
09:49 - and then we're going to do attribute
09:55 - and then attribute is going to be the
09:56 - source
09:58 - and that source inside that source is
10:01 - going to be the icon which is
10:03 - all this
10:05 - all right
10:07 - cool let's save it
10:09 - let's see that works let's reload the
10:11 - page
10:13 - yay
10:14 - we have here it seems like he's like
10:17 - thunderstorms or something really bad is
10:20 - going on in here
10:21 - which is true
10:23 - like today is a very rainy day so
10:26 - yes
10:27 - um all right cool so we have the icon
10:29 - done
10:30 - so let's do the same thing with the
10:32 - temperature so let's create another
10:34 - variable
10:36 - let's call it temp
10:38 - equals two
10:41 - and it's going to be data dot
10:44 - i think is um weather dot temp
10:48 - yeah i think that's that's what it is
10:51 - and this is gonna give us
10:54 - that number so let's go back make sure
10:56 - make sure that that's true
11:00 - all right
11:01 - um
11:04 - no actually it's main so i have to fix
11:06 - that so it's
11:07 - a main dot temp so let's go back
11:10 - it's not weather
11:12 - is main
11:15 - all right cool now we do the same thing
11:18 - we're gonna go here
11:21 - and
11:24 - this is the dot the class temp
11:29 - but this time we're going to append
11:33 - that data
11:36 - and this was going to be temp
11:39 - let's save that and let's see what
11:41 - happens
11:44 - that's it
11:45 - here we go we have we have the
11:47 - temperature we have the icon the
11:48 - temperature
11:50 - and i think we're missing
11:52 - our
11:55 - whether
11:56 - um text like it's raining or it's not
11:58 - raining it's sunny what it is
12:01 - so let's go back and look let's do that
12:04 - let's do it right here
12:06 - in the middle that way we are like
12:10 - organize so variable
12:12 - we can create something called weather
12:16 - or weather name or i don't know whatever
12:18 - you want
12:20 - equals to
12:22 - data dot weather
12:26 - let's go back
12:28 - and see where it is
12:31 - so weather
12:32 - and then there's the arrays i'm gonna
12:34 - get the first one
12:38 - it's gonna be
12:40 - thunderstorm okay so there is
12:42 - thunderstorms
12:45 - so weather
12:47 - zero
12:49 - dot
12:50 - main we're going to go down here i'm
12:53 - going to do the same thing
12:55 - we're going to get
12:58 - the weather
13:00 - dot append let's append the data
13:04 - and it's going gonna be weather
13:08 - let's save it let's see what happens if
13:10 - it if it works
13:13 - yeah and there we go we have the cloud
13:15 - it says that we have thunderstorm and is
13:18 - 86. now
13:20 - i don't want to
13:22 - show this 0.49
13:24 - and point 49 i just want to show 86
13:30 - and there is a trick
13:31 - we can do it right here on the weather
13:35 - not actually on the temperature sorry
13:38 - we can do math dot
13:40 - floor
13:46 - and let's see if that helps
13:50 - whoops
13:52 - sorry
13:53 - is
13:55 - math like this
13:58 - let's go
14:03 - cool now we have only 86
14:05 - all right so
14:07 - you don't have to do the math floor
14:08 - actually there's some other options
14:11 - um
14:13 - so i'm gonna put a link in the
14:15 - description if you want to play with
14:16 - this
14:19 - but i think that's it we just
14:22 - need to kind of make it a little
14:24 - prettier because right now it looks
14:27 - very very weird
14:29 - so let's go and let's add some css so
14:32 - let's say
14:33 - weather
14:34 - container
14:39 - let's do like a i don't know like a gray
14:42 - background
14:45 - uh let's you know what let's let's align
14:48 - everything to the center
14:51 - and we have the
14:53 - the weather text the one that sets
14:56 - thunderstorm right now
14:58 - let's do font size
15:01 - i'm like 22 pixels you know bigger
15:04 - and let's remove all the margin
15:06 - because i know paragraph have
15:08 - like margin
15:10 - uh we have a temp like the temperature
15:14 - we can do this one i wanted like
15:17 - pretty big so let's do like 60 pixels
15:21 - um same thing margin zero
15:24 - and oops
15:27 - and the font
15:28 - weight i want it to be bold
15:34 - all right let's save that i think that's
15:36 - that's good for now
15:38 - let's reload the page
15:40 - and here it is
15:42 - so you have the icon
15:44 - it says we have thunderstorm
15:47 - and it's 86.
15:49 - so let's see what happens if we change
15:51 - like orlando um to like new york for
15:55 - example let's go there
15:57 - let's go here
15:59 - let's say
16:01 - um
16:02 - you know what let's do something real
16:04 - quick right here so we can do that very
16:06 - easily so let's create a variable called
16:09 - city for example
16:12 - and
16:13 - right now is orlando
16:16 - and
16:18 - right now in the url what we can do is
16:20 - let's remove the name orlando
16:22 - we just close the url there
16:25 - we do plus sign
16:28 - cd
16:30 - plus sign and then we open the url again
16:33 - all right so now
16:35 - this is coming from
16:37 - this variable
16:38 - okay so let's save it let's see if it
16:40 - works
16:43 - yep same thing
16:46 - so now let's change this to like new
16:47 - york
16:54 - let's go there reload the page
16:57 - here it is so new york right now 75
17:00 - clear seems like it's a beautiful day so
17:04 - that's how you do it um you can go very
17:07 - very complex and
17:09 - and use another api that gets
17:12 - the user specific user locations and
17:15 - then
17:16 - the cd variable will change depending on
17:19 - the location of the person and all that
17:21 - stuff it can get very complicated but
17:23 - this is
17:25 - a very very uh simple way to get started
17:28 - and understand how public api works not
17:32 - only weather but there is a bunch of
17:35 - other apis with other
17:37 - data that you can use in and you can use
17:39 - this you can use it just like this
17:42 - okay
17:44 - so that's it

Cleaned transcript:

what's going on my name is jay and in this video i want to show you how you can use a public api so let's see so for this video we're going to be using openweathermap.org they have a very very simple api they have a ton of data that we can use so if you go there and then you click api you will see all these options right here but the one that i want is this one the first one the current weather data that's the one that i want okay so click subscribe you will see all these options um the one that we're gonna use is the free version which is gonna work for this video and it works for like a personal website and stuff like that so click on the get api key and start so you need to sign up just like a normal website just your email and password and all that stuff and they're gonna give you an api key um so that way you can request all that data so let's test the api so let's see if it works i have here the url that they provide which is this one right here all right so now we need to add question mark q equals to whatever city and you can see that i have it already there so i live in orlando so it's orlando and then and app app id equals to whatever api key they gave you all right so that's mine don't try to use mine because it's not gonna work for you i'm gonna hit enter and here you go so i have all the data from the current weather in orlando which is great one thing that i want to do right now is because if you can see here on temperature that's uh it's a different unit we use a different unit so i'm just gonna put it right here after this and so it's going to be unit equals to imperial and then end and i'm going to leave the app id so i'm going to hit enter again and now we have whatever you use you can change it but this is what we use in the united states cool now that we have this url ready to go i'm just going to go to my text editor and start coding here i have an html file the only thing i have is i'm requesting jquery we're gonna we're gonna use it to request the data we have a script dot dis which is empty and we have a style dot css it's empty we're going to add some stuff in a minute so let's start by adding some html here so the first thing i'm gonna do i'm gonna add a container everything's gonna be inside that container so it can be like weather container okay and inside there we can do a paragraph and then we can add like a class of um this can be actually you know what first i'm gonna add an icon like if it's raining if it's raining we can do like a rain cloud with some drops or whatever if it's sunny we can add you know a sun or something like that so that's the icon let's put icon as a class this is going to be like the name so if it's raining it's going to be like rain if it's sunny it's going to be sunny so this is we can name it name it um i don't know whether whatever you can name it whatever you want so let's create another one and this one is going to be the temperature of course tank all right cool i think that's all we need for now i like if i want the weather i just want like you know whatever is happening in the and the temperature and then the icon is something cool you know that we'd like to see all right so that's it for the html i'm gonna save it and then for the javascript let's go here because we have jquery we can use something called get json and get json is going to get all this data for us because this is json this is json file so let's go back there and let's do dollar sign dot get json just like this and then we're gonna do inside here we're gonna do the url coma and then function sorry function just like that all right so we need to include that url here let's go back and get it where is it here it is copy and paste it right there all right so what i'm going to do i'm going to put here inside the function i'm going to put data all the data is going to be inside there so i can do something like console.log data so i'm going to save that and let's go back here so this is my page right now i'm gonna reload my page and here you go we can see all the data the same thing we have here we can see it we have it now available for us on the website everything is here all right cool now that that's working let's go back and here inside the function we're gonna do like let's create the variable of the icon so let's do variable icon and i have a url that they provided for everyone to get the icon so if we go here let's see if they have here on weather so you can see that um there is a icon here and there is like a number in the letter you don't understand how we're going to use this in a minute so they provided a url for that icon so let's see let's open here and let's go back and what was the code is what 11d let's copy and paste it dot png look at this so every single thing is a different thing depending on the weather the icon is going to change and it's going to be this url cool so let's go back to my code let's do oops that's not what i want i want the url which is this and then i'm going to do plus and we need to add um that code which is going to be data dot let's go here let's see so it's data dot weather 0 and then dot icon so it's data dot weather zero and this is because it's an array it's a list you can see that we have oops quit we have um zero one and it's an array so we need to do uh square bracket zero and then dot icon that's it now we're gonna have if we call icon we're gonna have this and then whatever code it is and actually i need to add the png file so the png format so let's go plus sign and dot png now that's gonna work there you go so now let me call the icon and see if it works console.log icon all right let's go back let's reload this page here it is just click on it and that's it we have the icon all right so let's go back here so that's working let's remove console.log we don't need it and now what i'm going to do is i want to add that icon inside this image so let's do dollar sign we can get that the icon class and then we're going to do attribute and then attribute is going to be the source and that source inside that source is going to be the icon which is all this all right cool let's save it let's see that works let's reload the page yay we have here it seems like he's like thunderstorms or something really bad is going on in here which is true like today is a very rainy day so yes um all right cool so we have the icon done so let's do the same thing with the temperature so let's create another variable let's call it temp equals two and it's going to be data dot i think is um weather dot temp yeah i think that's that's what it is and this is gonna give us that number so let's go back make sure make sure that that's true all right um no actually it's main so i have to fix that so it's a main dot temp so let's go back it's not weather is main all right cool now we do the same thing we're gonna go here and this is the dot the class temp but this time we're going to append that data and this was going to be temp let's save that and let's see what happens that's it here we go we have we have the temperature we have the icon the temperature and i think we're missing our whether um text like it's raining or it's not raining it's sunny what it is so let's go back and look let's do that let's do it right here in the middle that way we are like organize so variable we can create something called weather or weather name or i don't know whatever you want equals to data dot weather let's go back and see where it is so weather and then there's the arrays i'm gonna get the first one it's gonna be thunderstorm okay so there is thunderstorms so weather zero dot main we're going to go down here i'm going to do the same thing we're going to get the weather dot append let's append the data and it's going gonna be weather let's save it let's see what happens if it if it works yeah and there we go we have the cloud it says that we have thunderstorm and is 86. now i don't want to show this 0.49 and point 49 i just want to show 86 and there is a trick we can do it right here on the weather not actually on the temperature sorry we can do math dot floor and let's see if that helps whoops sorry is math like this let's go cool now we have only 86 all right so you don't have to do the math floor actually there's some other options um so i'm gonna put a link in the description if you want to play with this but i think that's it we just need to kind of make it a little prettier because right now it looks very very weird so let's go and let's add some css so let's say weather container let's do like a i don't know like a gray background uh let's you know what let's let's align everything to the center and we have the the weather text the one that sets thunderstorm right now let's do font size i'm like 22 pixels you know bigger and let's remove all the margin because i know paragraph have like margin uh we have a temp like the temperature we can do this one i wanted like pretty big so let's do like 60 pixels um same thing margin zero and oops and the font weight i want it to be bold all right let's save that i think that's that's good for now let's reload the page and here it is so you have the icon it says we have thunderstorm and it's 86. so let's see what happens if we change like orlando um to like new york for example let's go there let's go here let's say um you know what let's do something real quick right here so we can do that very easily so let's create a variable called city for example and right now is orlando and right now in the url what we can do is let's remove the name orlando we just close the url there we do plus sign cd plus sign and then we open the url again all right so now this is coming from this variable okay so let's save it let's see if it works yep same thing so now let's change this to like new york let's go there reload the page here it is so new york right now 75 clear seems like it's a beautiful day so that's how you do it um you can go very very complex and and use another api that gets the user specific user locations and then the cd variable will change depending on the location of the person and all that stuff it can get very complicated but this is a very very uh simple way to get started and understand how public api works not only weather but there is a bunch of other apis with other data that you can use in and you can use this you can use it just like this okay so that's it
