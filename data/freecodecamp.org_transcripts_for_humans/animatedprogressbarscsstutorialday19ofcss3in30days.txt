00:02 - into trouble
00:03 - progress bars animated
00:05 - bottom
00:07 - infinite progress bars nice hi everybody
00:09 - what's up welcome back to css3 in 30
00:11 - days today's day number 19 and we're
00:13 - gonna be coding
00:15 - in css three only
00:17 - some animated progress bars let me show
00:20 - you what we're going to be making here
00:21 - in the final result you can see we got
00:23 - two examples we got example one and two
00:25 - we got uh
00:26 - this really interesting looking nav a
00:29 - progress bar that
00:31 - slides
00:33 - up to about 60 in fact it slides exactly
00:36 - to 60 percent
00:37 - and it has this like kind of like uh
00:40 - barbershop
00:41 - you know stripey animated effect going
00:44 - on
00:44 - and it's
00:45 - it's set within and uh kind of looks
00:48 - like an inset like uh
00:51 - parent container with an inset shadow so
00:54 - it has this really cool
00:55 - three-dimensional effect some rounded
00:57 - corners it slides all the way up to
00:59 - sixty percent goes back resets
01:01 - and then example two
01:03 - the interesting thing about this one is
01:04 - that it goes
01:06 - to one hundred percent
01:08 - uh but the thing is it has a little tool
01:10 - tip that follows it to let you know it's
01:13 - loading or whatever
01:14 - you want to put in that
01:16 - so we're going to be making those it's
01:18 - relatively straightforward we're going
01:19 - to be messing around with some
01:21 - animations again and some keyframes so
01:24 - hang tight let's jump in our code editor
01:27 - open up number 19 animated progress bars
01:29 - get yourself set up and ready to go and
01:32 - let's hang out for the next 20 minutes
01:33 - or so and see what kind of trouble we
01:35 - can't get ourselves into alright so here
01:38 - is the index file i'm just going to show
01:39 - you the markup real quick it looks a
01:42 - little bit like this so example one we
01:43 - got animation bar one that's our class
01:45 - in there we have a span with a style of
01:47 - width sixty percent
01:49 - simply just means the width of that
01:51 - container is sixty percent going to be
01:53 - animating it to its its maximum width
01:57 - and example number two we have a span
01:59 - with a data label attribute
02:02 - uh that says loading
02:05 - we could have made that say just title
02:07 - or
02:08 - even
02:09 - alt but we're going to be using data
02:11 - label
02:12 - instead and we're going to be using the
02:15 - text in there just saying loading it
02:16 - could be whatever you want it to be so
02:18 - that's it for the markup
02:20 - jump into the sandbox and get started
02:23 - let's start out with
02:25 - the animation
02:28 - bar one we're going to say position
02:31 - relative
02:32 - display block
02:35 - there we go
02:36 - padding 5 pixels
02:38 - font size 16
02:40 - pixels again this is all just
02:42 - housekeeping stuff
02:43 - line height 16 pixels
02:47 - border radius we're gonna make it 30
02:50 - pixels so pretty rounded
02:52 - background
02:53 - rgba and it's going to be zero zero zero
02:56 - zero point one
02:58 - so an almost invisible black
03:00 - box shadow
03:02 - inset
03:04 - and we're going to say 0
03:07 - 1 pixel 2 pixels rgba 0 0 0 0.25
03:14 - okay
03:15 - but we're out also going to add another
03:17 - shadow to that if i left it like so
03:18 - let's see what happens
03:20 - so
03:22 - it looks pretty good as is but if i were
03:24 - to also add zero one pixel
03:27 - rgba
03:28 - and then two five five two five five two
03:30 - five five and then zero point
03:34 - one
03:35 - see what that does
03:37 - that adds a it's hard to see but what
03:40 - i'm doing here is i'm adding a little
03:42 - bit of a highlight
03:43 - on the bottom maybe if i make it more
03:45 - prominent
03:46 - you should be able to see it so let me
03:48 - just make it like
03:51 - one
03:52 - so it's a straight up white line at the
03:55 - bottom you can see just gives it a
03:57 - little bit more depth so let's make it
03:59 - actually i kind of like it pretty bright
04:00 - let's do 0.8 on that one
04:02 - okay that looks pretty good now what
04:04 - we're going to do is we're going to
04:05 - style that span within it so we're going
04:07 - to say
04:08 - animation bar
04:10 - 1 span so we're going to style that up
04:13 - we're going to say position relative
04:15 - display so this is the progress bar
04:18 - within the container that we're styling
04:19 - up here inline block we're going to say
04:22 - vertical align middle want to stay in
04:24 - the center there height 20 pixels border
04:28 - radius
04:30 - 10 pixels on the top
04:32 - zero and zero so that's zero on the
04:34 - right zero on the left zero zero on the
04:36 - right zero on the bottom ten pixels on
04:38 - the left
04:39 - so 10 pixels of border radius on the top
04:42 - and on the left
04:45 - and we're going to say
04:48 - overflow
04:49 - hidden
04:52 - background color
04:55 - we're going to say f5
04:58 - 6982
05:01 - background size 100
05:04 - we're going to be playing around with a
05:05 - background image which is why we want to
05:08 - use background size okay now we're going
05:10 - to create a gradient so let's just let
05:12 - me just take that out for a sec and just
05:13 - see what we've come up with so it's just
05:15 - a like a pink
05:17 - progress bar
05:18 - the border radius is on the top and on
05:21 - the left because if i take it out it
05:23 - looks like this it's a square and i
05:25 - don't want it on the right side so i'm
05:26 - gonna put that back save it and i'm
05:28 - gonna keep the right side square the
05:29 - left side around it so it fits nicely
05:31 - within its parent container
05:34 - and uh overflow hidden because we're
05:36 - gonna have a
05:38 - we're going to have something going on
05:39 - within the inside of that so i'll show
05:41 - you in a moment
05:42 - background size 100 because now what we
05:44 - want to do is create a gradient
05:46 - background image
05:50 - linear gradient function and we're going
05:52 - to say two bottom
05:54 - it's going to go from top to bottom
05:56 - comma
06:00 - f2395a
06:04 - comma and then the next color will be
06:07 - b90
06:10 - c2b
06:11 - okay save that check it out now it's got
06:14 - this nice
06:15 - gradient it looks very rounded that's a
06:17 - very
06:18 - interesting looking um progress bar
06:21 - static progress bar so far
06:24 - and now what we want to do
06:27 - is we want to style we're going to we're
06:29 - going to animate it so we're going to
06:30 - leave a little bit of space for that but
06:31 - right now what we're going to do is
06:32 - we're going to style animation bar 1
06:37 - span
06:38 - after sudo element
06:41 - we're going to go position
06:43 - absolute
06:45 - top 0 left 0 right zero
06:49 - bottom zero
06:52 - we're going to say content empty string
06:54 - so it appears
06:55 - background size 100 percent
06:59 - and now we're going to create that that
07:02 - stripey barbershop pull effect
07:05 - background image
07:07 - linear gradient
07:09 - hang tight 45 degrees so we want that on
07:12 - a 45 degree angle we want the next color
07:15 - stop to be uh
07:16 - white i'm just gonna say triple f
07:19 - 25 so at 25 color stop it's gonna be
07:22 - white
07:23 - so if i save that you probably shouldn't
07:26 - even really see anything okay good
07:29 - and now what we're going to do
07:31 - is i'm going to put a comma
07:33 - and i'm going to go down to the next
07:36 - line
07:37 - and line it up here
07:39 - and i'm going to say rgba
07:42 - zero zero zero zero i want it to be
07:44 - totally transparent so for the next 25 i
07:47 - want it to be
07:49 - just uh invisible just like a chunk of
07:53 - invisible black that you can't see
07:55 - and then now the next line rgba the same
07:58 - thing in fact we're going to copy that
08:00 - and we're going to paste it out
08:02 - and it's going to be at the 50 percent
08:05 - color stop
08:07 - okay so now if i were to just close that
08:10 - up and save it let's see if we see
08:12 - anything so you can see the angle
08:14 - and things are looking kind of odd here
08:16 - but uh trust me this should work out
08:20 - let's see let's go back here put a comma
08:23 - and we're going to say
08:25 - triple f
08:26 - at the 50 mark triple f
08:29 - at the 75 mark
08:32 - rgba
08:34 - we're gonna do that zero zero zero again
08:36 - but at the 75 percent color stop and
08:39 - last we're gonna do rgba invisible
08:42 - close up the parentheses of linear
08:44 - gradient semicolon save it
08:47 - let's see what we've got
08:49 - okay so we've got ourselves
08:52 - a two line so it kind of looks like a
08:55 - candy cane actually it's around
08:57 - christmas time so this is kind of a nice
08:59 - little effect
09:01 - and you can see that it's got uh so it's
09:04 - got the angle red angle so
09:07 - you can see how this works so from 25 to
09:09 - 50 percent you've got the white and then
09:12 - from 25 sorry from zero to 25 percent
09:14 - white and then you got 25 to 50. it's
09:17 - invisible so you can see
09:18 - uh you can see the the red and so on and
09:21 - so forth so that's what we created there
09:23 - but now we need to change the size i
09:24 - don't like the size of that
09:26 - remove that comma so i'm going to go
09:28 - all the way back here
09:30 - and i'm going to overwrite background
09:32 - oops that overwrite background size and
09:36 - say 30 pixels and 30 pixels so so that
09:39 - should give us something like this okay
09:41 - now we're on to something here
09:43 - but i don't like how
09:45 - uh
09:46 - candy caney it looks
09:48 - despite enjoying the christmas season
09:50 - i'm going to say 0.3
09:52 - and just make it a little bit more
09:54 - transparent there we go so it's a little
09:55 - bit more subtle
09:57 - of an effect so we're also going to
09:59 - animate that
10:01 - so what we're going to do now
10:04 - is we're gonna go back up to the span
10:07 - and let's animate that one so we're
10:08 - gonna say
10:10 - we're gonna say animation
10:12 - let's say progress
10:14 - dash bar
10:16 - one
10:17 - over the course of 10 seconds infinitely
10:21 - and um let's make it
10:24 - ease
10:26 - and now we have to go down and make a
10:27 - keyframe
10:29 - keyframes and we're going to say
10:31 - progress
10:32 - dash bar dash one
10:34 - and here's where we're gonna start
10:36 - creating that animation at zero percent
10:39 - we're gonna say the width is twenty
10:40 - percent so it starts at twenty percent
10:42 - you can start it at zero if you want uh
10:44 - we're going to say 50
10:46 - in the timeline the width will be 80 so
10:49 - it's
10:50 - it's going to be making it to 80
10:53 - uh we might even be able to make this a
10:55 - little bit more simple let's say 100
10:57 - percent zero to 100
10:59 - and this is going to go
11:02 - up to
11:03 - 100
11:05 - of the width let's just see
11:07 - what that does
11:10 - let's save that
11:12 - and let's just see
11:15 - so it animates it's got an ease it goes
11:18 - it's going to 100 percent
11:21 - see how it really slows down at the ease
11:23 - there
11:24 - we don't want it to do that we actually
11:25 - want it to only go to
11:28 - that 60 let's say that's the width that
11:31 - it goes to
11:34 - and then it goes to about 60 ease is too
11:36 - slow for me
11:38 - you can make it linear if you want i'm
11:39 - going to say linear
11:43 - or ease in
11:44 - and it will be linear essentially for
11:46 - the rest
11:47 - and over the course of let's make it six
11:50 - seconds a little bit slow for me
11:53 - and it's gonna ease in it's going to
11:55 - start speeding up
11:58 - to the 60 mark
11:59 - and it stops like that
12:02 - uh interesting i don't really like how
12:04 - that looks let's go with zero percent
12:08 - it's going to start at zero percent i'm
12:10 - going to go to 60 and let's just make it
12:11 - straight up linear
12:16 - let's see what that does
12:21 - so it makes it to 60 percent
12:23 - and then it starts back so now if you
12:25 - want it to be a no if you wanted to to
12:26 - go back
12:28 - i know it doesn't really make sense so
12:30 - it's loading and then it goes to sixty
12:31 - percent and then it would just it just
12:32 - jumps back what you could do if you
12:34 - really wanted is you could say at the 50
12:38 - of the timeline it goes to the 60
12:40 - and then it goes back
12:42 - to
12:43 - with zero percent if you want it to be
12:45 - more smooth of just an animation like
12:47 - this it's going boom 60 and it's gonna
12:51 - make its way back
12:53 - it doesn't really make sense for the
12:54 - progress bar to do that
12:56 - um because that's kind of a tease you're
12:58 - like i'm loading i'm loading i'm loading
13:00 - and then it's like no never mind so i'm
13:03 - actually just gonna go back to our
13:05 - original style here
13:07 - and at the 100 mark
13:10 - go to 60 and then it restarts
13:13 - and i actually kind of think ease
13:17 - might be a good choice here so it's
13:19 - actually a little bit more of a
13:22 - it slows its way
13:24 - to the boom there we go that makes sense
13:26 - that looks good to me so let's keep
13:27 - going now what we want to do is we want
13:29 - to animate
13:30 - those little
13:32 - angled white candy cane bars i'm gonna
13:35 - call them
13:36 - barbershop
13:38 - pole candy cane bars uh let's go to our
13:42 - uh or span after here and we're gonna
13:44 - give it
13:45 - an animation as well we're going to call
13:47 - it
13:49 - progress dash bar
13:50 - dash after dash 1.
13:53 - clunky name but we're going to say 0.5
13:55 - seconds
13:56 - infinite
13:57 - and it's going to be a linear animation
14:01 - that means we need to create a keyframe
14:04 - so let's say keyframes
14:07 - the name of it is progress dash bar dash
14:11 - after dash 1
14:12 - and the animation
14:14 - will look like so
14:17 - at zero percent
14:19 - it's going to be the background position
14:21 - is going to be zero and 100 percent
14:25 - and at 100 percent of the timeline the
14:28 - background position is going to be 30
14:30 - pixels and 100
14:32 - let's see what that does
14:35 - so see how it's now moving
14:38 - it
14:39 - looks pretty cool
14:42 - so let's see what happens if we change
14:44 - this value background position to like
14:46 - 100 pixels let's just see
14:50 - it's moving
14:52 - its position a lot further
14:54 - so it's going really fast and it looks
14:57 - kind of weird and if you did something
14:58 - like 10 pixels it's going to move to a
15:00 - lot slow like a lot slower of a distance
15:02 - or smaller of a distance rather so you
15:04 - can see it's moving 10 pixels
15:07 - as you can see
15:08 - and if i if i move it 20 pixels you're
15:10 - going to see again it's going to look
15:11 - really jumpy that's because it's not
15:13 - making the full width
15:15 - of of that
15:17 - that bar we have it set as a background
15:19 - size of 30 and 30.
15:21 - so if we say 30 pixels
15:25 - as a background position it's going to
15:26 - look like an infinite loop
15:28 - and that looks nice
15:30 - awesome okay so that's it for that
15:33 - progress bar i'm liking that and now
15:36 - let's move on to the progress bar number
15:39 - two which is this one right here so now
15:42 - we're gonna say
15:44 - animation
15:45 - bar
15:46 - two so animation dash bar dash two we're
15:49 - gonna say position relative display
15:52 - block font size 16 pixels
15:55 - line height 16 pixels
15:57 - we're going to go a background rgba
16:01 - that's going to be a 0 0 0 and 0.1
16:04 - box shadow is going to be inset
16:07 - at zero one pixel
16:09 - two pixels and rgba we're gonna go zero
16:13 - zero zero and zero point two five okay
16:16 - see what that looks like
16:18 - uh you can't see it that's because
16:19 - there's no content within it there's the
16:22 - the span within it there's nothing in
16:24 - there so it's collapsing and there's no
16:26 - hard-coded height so that's why you
16:27 - cannot see it
16:29 - so let's just for the purposes of this
16:30 - testing let's give it a height of 20
16:32 - pixels so we can see it
16:34 - there it is
16:35 - uh we're going to take that out in a
16:36 - moment
16:37 - but i want that same effect as the
16:40 - example number one so that bottom
16:44 - gradient so
16:46 - uh sorry box shot i'm going to copy this
16:48 - box shadow all together i want the same
16:51 - box shadow style
16:52 - yes that's what i was going for we got
16:54 - that white highlight at the bottom it
16:56 - looks good okay so we know that's there
16:58 - let's remove the height hard-coded
16:59 - height we don't need it
17:01 - we want it to be a dynamic height based
17:02 - on its child element
17:05 - so now we're going to say animation
17:09 - dash bar dash 2
17:11 - span
17:13 - and we're going to say
17:15 - position relative display inline block
17:20 - vertical align middle
17:23 - height 20 pixels
17:26 - background color
17:28 - let's do double o e 6
17:31 - background size 100 because we're going
17:34 - to do a gradient here using background
17:36 - image
17:37 - and we're going to say linear gradient
17:39 - it's going to go to bottom that could be
17:41 - 2 left to right to top however you want
17:43 - it to be it's going to be double zero b
17:47 - so comma double zero b three b four
17:50 - comma and then double zero eight
17:53 - zero eight one that's the the two colors
17:55 - you need for the gradient save that
17:57 - let's check it out
17:59 - of course you're not going to see it
18:01 - because it has no width right now let's
18:03 - give it a width just to so we can see
18:06 - there we go 20 width you're going to see
18:08 - the gradient top to bottom it's that
18:09 - green to dark green
18:12 - looks pretty good i like that style it
18:14 - fills out the
18:15 - the parent element
18:18 - uh it looks nice i like it okay so i'm
18:20 - gonna remove that width because i don't
18:21 - actually need it
18:22 - now we're gonna use the before and after
18:24 - pseudo elements to create a tool tip
18:26 - uh that you can see right over here so
18:28 - let's jump down here we're going to
18:29 - style those up we just did tooltips
18:31 - yesterday so this shouldn't be too crazy
18:34 - for you animation bar 2 span before
18:36 - pseudo element
18:38 - we're going to say position
18:40 - absolute right it's going to be zero
18:43 - positioned absolutely on the zero bottom
18:45 - 100
18:47 - display inline block
18:50 - width
18:51 - 0
18:52 - height 0 now we're going to do basically
18:54 - what we're doing is we're creating the
18:57 - the arrow
18:59 - 10 pixels solid transparent
19:02 - border right
19:04 - which is zero
19:06 - border left
19:08 - no border bottom width is zero
19:12 - and then the border
19:13 - top color so the one we want to appear
19:16 - will be rgba zero zero zero zero point i
19:19 - know zero zero zero
19:20 - one
19:22 - and then content
19:24 - empty string
19:26 - now that should give us a little arrow
19:29 - as you can see just like that
19:31 - so it's actually looks like it's
19:32 - pointing in the top right but it's
19:34 - actually pointing down
19:36 - because relative to what you'll see here
19:39 - we want that little tiny
19:41 - almost like a little speech bubble
19:44 - so that is what we want
19:46 - i'm liking that so far and now it's time
19:47 - to style up the animation bar dash 2
19:50 - span after pseudoelement so this is the
19:52 - tool tip itself position absolute right
19:57 - zero
19:59 - bottom here's here's f here's the fun
20:01 - part calc we're gonna do what we did
20:02 - last time yesterday 100 so 100 down
20:06 - but plus 5 pixels to give some space
20:09 - sorry bottom is going to be 100 from the
20:11 - bottom so it's going to move up 100
20:13 - plus 5 pixels for to account for that
20:16 - arrow
20:17 - is that index just one just to keep it
20:19 - above the parent
20:21 - display inline block
20:23 - content we're going to use attribute and
20:26 - then select the data label so that's
20:28 - another fun thing whatever the attribute
20:30 - name is and that's what you can use
20:33 - for for the attribute there
20:37 - okay padding so it's going to pull out
20:38 - the text of that attribute is what i'm
20:40 - trying to say padding 5 pixels border
20:43 - radius is going to be
20:45 - let's do 5 pixels
20:47 - you can maybe do less if you want 3
20:49 - pixels
20:50 - font size 0.8
20:54 - m so pretty small
20:56 - based on its parent background color
20:58 - it's going to be rgba it's going to be
21:00 - that 0
21:02 - 0 0 1 again
21:04 - and the color of the text will be triple
21:06 - f for white
21:08 - save that check it out here in the
21:10 - browser there it is that looks good
21:12 - loading it's pulling that text
21:14 - it looks really good now all we got to
21:16 - do is animate
21:18 - the actual span
21:20 - so where's the span up here animate bar
21:23 - 2
21:24 - we're going to say animation the name of
21:26 - it will be progress bar
21:29 - two it's gonna be over let's do six
21:31 - seconds
21:33 - infinite and ease
21:36 - so now we have to create a keyframe and
21:39 - it should be pretty simple it's gonna be
21:40 - keyframes it's gonna be progress dash
21:43 - bar dash two at the zero percent we're
21:47 - going to say
21:48 - width is 20 we're going to start there
21:50 - and at 100
21:52 - we're going to do width 100 very very
21:54 - simple save that check it out in the
21:56 - browser so it starts ah started at zero
22:00 - so maybe so you could see it and then it
22:02 - would animate but check it out
22:04 - there we go it's loading it's looking
22:05 - good it's easing it's easing it's easing
22:07 - just to about 100
22:09 - boom done restarts the animation that is
22:11 - it for our animation of the progress bar
22:15 - we kind of ripped through that one so
22:17 - feel free to go back and check it out
22:19 - again if you need to do that uh
22:21 - animation progress animated progress
22:23 - bars are a great thing to use
22:24 - if you're loading a website or loading a
22:26 - loading screen or anything like that
22:27 - building applications i hope you enjoyed
22:29 - today gave a few ideas i'll see you
22:31 - tomorrow when day number 20.

Cleaned transcript:

into trouble progress bars animated bottom infinite progress bars nice hi everybody what's up welcome back to css3 in 30 days today's day number 19 and we're gonna be coding in css three only some animated progress bars let me show you what we're going to be making here in the final result you can see we got two examples we got example one and two we got uh this really interesting looking nav a progress bar that slides up to about 60 in fact it slides exactly to 60 percent and it has this like kind of like uh barbershop you know stripey animated effect going on and it's it's set within and uh kind of looks like an inset like uh parent container with an inset shadow so it has this really cool threedimensional effect some rounded corners it slides all the way up to sixty percent goes back resets and then example two the interesting thing about this one is that it goes to one hundred percent uh but the thing is it has a little tool tip that follows it to let you know it's loading or whatever you want to put in that so we're going to be making those it's relatively straightforward we're going to be messing around with some animations again and some keyframes so hang tight let's jump in our code editor open up number 19 animated progress bars get yourself set up and ready to go and let's hang out for the next 20 minutes or so and see what kind of trouble we can't get ourselves into alright so here is the index file i'm just going to show you the markup real quick it looks a little bit like this so example one we got animation bar one that's our class in there we have a span with a style of width sixty percent simply just means the width of that container is sixty percent going to be animating it to its its maximum width and example number two we have a span with a data label attribute uh that says loading we could have made that say just title or even alt but we're going to be using data label instead and we're going to be using the text in there just saying loading it could be whatever you want it to be so that's it for the markup jump into the sandbox and get started let's start out with the animation bar one we're going to say position relative display block there we go padding 5 pixels font size 16 pixels again this is all just housekeeping stuff line height 16 pixels border radius we're gonna make it 30 pixels so pretty rounded background rgba and it's going to be zero zero zero zero point one so an almost invisible black box shadow inset and we're going to say 0 1 pixel 2 pixels rgba 0 0 0 0.25 okay but we're out also going to add another shadow to that if i left it like so let's see what happens so it looks pretty good as is but if i were to also add zero one pixel rgba and then two five five two five five two five five and then zero point one see what that does that adds a it's hard to see but what i'm doing here is i'm adding a little bit of a highlight on the bottom maybe if i make it more prominent you should be able to see it so let me just make it like one so it's a straight up white line at the bottom you can see just gives it a little bit more depth so let's make it actually i kind of like it pretty bright let's do 0.8 on that one okay that looks pretty good now what we're going to do is we're going to style that span within it so we're going to say animation bar 1 span so we're going to style that up we're going to say position relative display so this is the progress bar within the container that we're styling up here inline block we're going to say vertical align middle want to stay in the center there height 20 pixels border radius 10 pixels on the top zero and zero so that's zero on the right zero on the left zero zero on the right zero on the bottom ten pixels on the left so 10 pixels of border radius on the top and on the left and we're going to say overflow hidden background color we're going to say f5 6982 background size 100 we're going to be playing around with a background image which is why we want to use background size okay now we're going to create a gradient so let's just let me just take that out for a sec and just see what we've come up with so it's just a like a pink progress bar the border radius is on the top and on the left because if i take it out it looks like this it's a square and i don't want it on the right side so i'm gonna put that back save it and i'm gonna keep the right side square the left side around it so it fits nicely within its parent container and uh overflow hidden because we're gonna have a we're going to have something going on within the inside of that so i'll show you in a moment background size 100 because now what we want to do is create a gradient background image linear gradient function and we're going to say two bottom it's going to go from top to bottom comma f2395a comma and then the next color will be b90 c2b okay save that check it out now it's got this nice gradient it looks very rounded that's a very interesting looking um progress bar static progress bar so far and now what we want to do is we want to style we're going to we're going to animate it so we're going to leave a little bit of space for that but right now what we're going to do is we're going to style animation bar 1 span after sudo element we're going to go position absolute top 0 left 0 right zero bottom zero we're going to say content empty string so it appears background size 100 percent and now we're going to create that that stripey barbershop pull effect background image linear gradient hang tight 45 degrees so we want that on a 45 degree angle we want the next color stop to be uh white i'm just gonna say triple f 25 so at 25 color stop it's gonna be white so if i save that you probably shouldn't even really see anything okay good and now what we're going to do is i'm going to put a comma and i'm going to go down to the next line and line it up here and i'm going to say rgba zero zero zero zero i want it to be totally transparent so for the next 25 i want it to be just uh invisible just like a chunk of invisible black that you can't see and then now the next line rgba the same thing in fact we're going to copy that and we're going to paste it out and it's going to be at the 50 percent color stop okay so now if i were to just close that up and save it let's see if we see anything so you can see the angle and things are looking kind of odd here but uh trust me this should work out let's see let's go back here put a comma and we're going to say triple f at the 50 mark triple f at the 75 mark rgba we're gonna do that zero zero zero again but at the 75 percent color stop and last we're gonna do rgba invisible close up the parentheses of linear gradient semicolon save it let's see what we've got okay so we've got ourselves a two line so it kind of looks like a candy cane actually it's around christmas time so this is kind of a nice little effect and you can see that it's got uh so it's got the angle red angle so you can see how this works so from 25 to 50 percent you've got the white and then from 25 sorry from zero to 25 percent white and then you got 25 to 50. it's invisible so you can see uh you can see the the red and so on and so forth so that's what we created there but now we need to change the size i don't like the size of that remove that comma so i'm going to go all the way back here and i'm going to overwrite background oops that overwrite background size and say 30 pixels and 30 pixels so so that should give us something like this okay now we're on to something here but i don't like how uh candy caney it looks despite enjoying the christmas season i'm going to say 0.3 and just make it a little bit more transparent there we go so it's a little bit more subtle of an effect so we're also going to animate that so what we're going to do now is we're gonna go back up to the span and let's animate that one so we're gonna say we're gonna say animation let's say progress dash bar one over the course of 10 seconds infinitely and um let's make it ease and now we have to go down and make a keyframe keyframes and we're going to say progress dash bar dash one and here's where we're gonna start creating that animation at zero percent we're gonna say the width is twenty percent so it starts at twenty percent you can start it at zero if you want uh we're going to say 50 in the timeline the width will be 80 so it's it's going to be making it to 80 uh we might even be able to make this a little bit more simple let's say 100 percent zero to 100 and this is going to go up to 100 of the width let's just see what that does let's save that and let's just see so it animates it's got an ease it goes it's going to 100 percent see how it really slows down at the ease there we don't want it to do that we actually want it to only go to that 60 let's say that's the width that it goes to and then it goes to about 60 ease is too slow for me you can make it linear if you want i'm going to say linear or ease in and it will be linear essentially for the rest and over the course of let's make it six seconds a little bit slow for me and it's gonna ease in it's going to start speeding up to the 60 mark and it stops like that uh interesting i don't really like how that looks let's go with zero percent it's going to start at zero percent i'm going to go to 60 and let's just make it straight up linear let's see what that does so it makes it to 60 percent and then it starts back so now if you want it to be a no if you wanted to to go back i know it doesn't really make sense so it's loading and then it goes to sixty percent and then it would just it just jumps back what you could do if you really wanted is you could say at the 50 of the timeline it goes to the 60 and then it goes back to with zero percent if you want it to be more smooth of just an animation like this it's going boom 60 and it's gonna make its way back it doesn't really make sense for the progress bar to do that um because that's kind of a tease you're like i'm loading i'm loading i'm loading and then it's like no never mind so i'm actually just gonna go back to our original style here and at the 100 mark go to 60 and then it restarts and i actually kind of think ease might be a good choice here so it's actually a little bit more of a it slows its way to the boom there we go that makes sense that looks good to me so let's keep going now what we want to do is we want to animate those little angled white candy cane bars i'm gonna call them barbershop pole candy cane bars uh let's go to our uh or span after here and we're gonna give it an animation as well we're going to call it progress dash bar dash after dash 1. clunky name but we're going to say 0.5 seconds infinite and it's going to be a linear animation that means we need to create a keyframe so let's say keyframes the name of it is progress dash bar dash after dash 1 and the animation will look like so at zero percent it's going to be the background position is going to be zero and 100 percent and at 100 percent of the timeline the background position is going to be 30 pixels and 100 let's see what that does so see how it's now moving it looks pretty cool so let's see what happens if we change this value background position to like 100 pixels let's just see it's moving its position a lot further so it's going really fast and it looks kind of weird and if you did something like 10 pixels it's going to move to a lot slow like a lot slower of a distance or smaller of a distance rather so you can see it's moving 10 pixels as you can see and if i if i move it 20 pixels you're going to see again it's going to look really jumpy that's because it's not making the full width of of that that bar we have it set as a background size of 30 and 30. so if we say 30 pixels as a background position it's going to look like an infinite loop and that looks nice awesome okay so that's it for that progress bar i'm liking that and now let's move on to the progress bar number two which is this one right here so now we're gonna say animation bar two so animation dash bar dash two we're gonna say position relative display block font size 16 pixels line height 16 pixels we're going to go a background rgba that's going to be a 0 0 0 and 0.1 box shadow is going to be inset at zero one pixel two pixels and rgba we're gonna go zero zero zero and zero point two five okay see what that looks like uh you can't see it that's because there's no content within it there's the the span within it there's nothing in there so it's collapsing and there's no hardcoded height so that's why you cannot see it so let's just for the purposes of this testing let's give it a height of 20 pixels so we can see it there it is uh we're going to take that out in a moment but i want that same effect as the example number one so that bottom gradient so uh sorry box shot i'm going to copy this box shadow all together i want the same box shadow style yes that's what i was going for we got that white highlight at the bottom it looks good okay so we know that's there let's remove the height hardcoded height we don't need it we want it to be a dynamic height based on its child element so now we're going to say animation dash bar dash 2 span and we're going to say position relative display inline block vertical align middle height 20 pixels background color let's do double o e 6 background size 100 because we're going to do a gradient here using background image and we're going to say linear gradient it's going to go to bottom that could be 2 left to right to top however you want it to be it's going to be double zero b so comma double zero b three b four comma and then double zero eight zero eight one that's the the two colors you need for the gradient save that let's check it out of course you're not going to see it because it has no width right now let's give it a width just to so we can see there we go 20 width you're going to see the gradient top to bottom it's that green to dark green looks pretty good i like that style it fills out the the parent element uh it looks nice i like it okay so i'm gonna remove that width because i don't actually need it now we're gonna use the before and after pseudo elements to create a tool tip uh that you can see right over here so let's jump down here we're going to style those up we just did tooltips yesterday so this shouldn't be too crazy for you animation bar 2 span before pseudo element we're going to say position absolute right it's going to be zero positioned absolutely on the zero bottom 100 display inline block width 0 height 0 now we're going to do basically what we're doing is we're creating the the arrow 10 pixels solid transparent border right which is zero border left no border bottom width is zero and then the border top color so the one we want to appear will be rgba zero zero zero zero point i know zero zero zero one and then content empty string now that should give us a little arrow as you can see just like that so it's actually looks like it's pointing in the top right but it's actually pointing down because relative to what you'll see here we want that little tiny almost like a little speech bubble so that is what we want i'm liking that so far and now it's time to style up the animation bar dash 2 span after pseudoelement so this is the tool tip itself position absolute right zero bottom here's here's f here's the fun part calc we're gonna do what we did last time yesterday 100 so 100 down but plus 5 pixels to give some space sorry bottom is going to be 100 from the bottom so it's going to move up 100 plus 5 pixels for to account for that arrow is that index just one just to keep it above the parent display inline block content we're going to use attribute and then select the data label so that's another fun thing whatever the attribute name is and that's what you can use for for the attribute there okay padding so it's going to pull out the text of that attribute is what i'm trying to say padding 5 pixels border radius is going to be let's do 5 pixels you can maybe do less if you want 3 pixels font size 0.8 m so pretty small based on its parent background color it's going to be rgba it's going to be that 0 0 0 1 again and the color of the text will be triple f for white save that check it out here in the browser there it is that looks good loading it's pulling that text it looks really good now all we got to do is animate the actual span so where's the span up here animate bar 2 we're going to say animation the name of it will be progress bar two it's gonna be over let's do six seconds infinite and ease so now we have to create a keyframe and it should be pretty simple it's gonna be keyframes it's gonna be progress dash bar dash two at the zero percent we're going to say width is 20 we're going to start there and at 100 we're going to do width 100 very very simple save that check it out in the browser so it starts ah started at zero so maybe so you could see it and then it would animate but check it out there we go it's loading it's looking good it's easing it's easing it's easing just to about 100 boom done restarts the animation that is it for our animation of the progress bar we kind of ripped through that one so feel free to go back and check it out again if you need to do that uh animation progress animated progress bars are a great thing to use if you're loading a website or loading a loading screen or anything like that building applications i hope you enjoyed today gave a few ideas i'll see you tomorrow when day number 20.
