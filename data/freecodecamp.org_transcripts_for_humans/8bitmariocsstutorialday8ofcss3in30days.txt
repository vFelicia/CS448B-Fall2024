00:02 - welcome back to css3 in 30 days
00:05 - guess what's happening today
00:07 - we are going to be making an 8-bit super
00:10 - mario with just css3
00:13 - i'm not joking check it out over here we
00:16 - got day 8 8-bit super mario or 8-bit
00:20 - mario
00:22 - uh what's gonna happen here is check it
00:24 - out
00:25 - that
00:26 - that's what we're gonna make in css and
00:28 - then i just have this little kind of css
00:30 - animation when you click the wahoo
00:32 - button
00:39 - see something like that uh the sounds
00:41 - you have to provide yourself
00:44 - uh but that's what we're gonna be doing
00:46 - and so it's pretty interesting how it's
00:48 - done
00:49 - the html is beautifully simple and if
00:52 - only that were all you had to do then
00:54 - that would be pretty cool but the css is
00:58 - a little bit interesting and i'll show
00:59 - you why
01:00 - now keep in mind this isn't necessarily
01:02 - a practical use of css3
01:05 - i don't know how many times i've ever
01:07 - been paid
01:08 - to make super mario
01:11 - in css except for now
01:13 - whoa
01:16 - let's head over to our course files here
01:18 - and
01:19 - download the 8-bit number 8 8-bit super
01:22 - mario project files you'll go ahead and
01:24 - do that and come back right here to this
01:26 - part of the video and what's going to
01:28 - happen here is we have our index sandbox
01:30 - and final css as usual here in the index
01:34 - check out the markup
01:36 - i'm going to go
01:37 - down to the final result here
01:39 - all we have is a button
01:41 - a div with the class of mario block and
01:44 - final mario i always prepend uh
01:47 - final double underscore for the final
01:50 - res uh the final css so let's go up to
01:52 - the sandbox this is all the markup
01:54 - you're going to be using so we have the
01:55 - button
01:56 - and this is mario here mario block and
02:00 - mario
02:01 - two divs
02:03 - that is pretty cool
02:05 - so how does this work let's go over to
02:07 - the browser again and i'm just going to
02:09 - inspect this
02:11 - and show you what's going on here super
02:14 - mario is in a div called
02:17 - mario block so here he is he's in a
02:19 - block it's 320 by 320. pixels i have it
02:23 - set up as 16m by 16m
02:26 - and we'll get into the measurements in a
02:28 - moment here in there we have final mario
02:30 - and there's simply just one line going
02:32 - across it's one by one block which is 20
02:35 - by 20 pixels or um as we can see here 1m
02:40 - now
02:41 - you can see that
02:43 - there are 16 blocks going across that's
02:45 - because we've set up in final mario
02:48 - block 16 m so this is 16 by 16 which
02:51 - equates to 320 and 320 pixels in this
02:54 - case
02:55 - uh and so that means the container we're
02:57 - working with is 16 by 16.
03:00 - and each block of the mario pixel i
03:04 - guess we could say because he's an 8 bit
03:05 - so he's like a 16 pixel uh sort of thing
03:09 - the width is 1 m so we have 1 m
03:12 - and 16 of those fit across
03:15 - so final mario is officially just 1m by
03:17 - 1m and what we're doing here is using a
03:20 - bunch of box shadows you can see his
03:22 - colors here
03:23 - look at that that is hairy
03:28 - but that is how we do it we just have
03:31 - a box shadow that has multiple
03:34 - values separated by comma
03:38 - just putting the place in the colors on
03:40 - a grid so for example 0 and 0 is the top
03:43 - left and then 1 and zero is one m over
03:47 - and that you know it's at the top so it
03:49 - goes in that sort of grid like uh
03:51 - fashion
03:53 - so that is how we make mario using just
03:57 - box shadows so go over to your
03:59 - let me show you here in the final css
04:01 - you can see how it works
04:03 - we have
04:04 - box shadow and then a bunch
04:07 - of values now i'm not going to make you
04:10 - watch me code all these values out i'll
04:12 - get started to show you the pattern
04:15 - and then
04:16 - i'm going to leave it up to you
04:18 - to finish it
04:20 - now you're going to need to reference
04:23 - the
04:24 - effect the final version pretty
04:27 - pretty closely
04:29 - but keep in mind you're working on a
04:31 - grid a 16 by 16 grid you simply are just
04:34 - kind of painting by numbers or cssing by
04:36 - numbers let's jump into our sandbox
04:38 - let's go we'll get started with the
04:40 - basics so we're going to style the
04:42 - mario block
04:44 - that is the container wrapping it all
04:46 - we're going to say display inline block
04:49 - position relative
04:51 - margin 80 pixels auto
04:55 - width
04:56 - 16m
04:58 - height 16m the reason why we're using
05:01 - m's here is because the container within
05:04 - the mario block which is just called
05:06 - mario
05:07 - when we use m's it's r it's referencing
05:10 - the the size
05:12 - of its parent whereas when you're using
05:15 - ram it's relative to the root
05:18 - so with m it's relative to its parent so
05:20 - when i say 16 by 16 m that is the height
05:24 - and width of the mario block container
05:27 - you can see here in the browser we've
05:28 - got a container here that is in theory
05:30 - 16 by 16 m's
05:33 - now what we'll do
05:35 - is we will do basic styles here for
05:38 - just mario
05:40 - display block
05:42 - width 1m
05:44 - height 1m so now officially we have one
05:49 - let's call them pixels just for this
05:51 - moment they're not actual pixels
05:53 - this 1m block is going to be like one
05:56 - big ass pixel
05:58 - and there's 16 of them going across and
06:01 - 16 of them going down so now you just
06:02 - have to draw mario using box shadows
06:05 - within that so
06:07 - let's just say the background color will
06:09 - be
06:12 - the that blue background we have here in
06:14 - the container e7 double e f1
06:18 - okay
06:19 - this is where
06:21 - the magic happens let's say box shadow
06:25 - and i'm gonna go zero m zero m
06:29 - and e seven e e f one so that is the
06:33 - first line that's the top left
06:36 - zero and zero is going to be that blue
06:38 - so what's gonna happen here is we want
06:41 - this here is here is mario this is
06:43 - officially his size right here let me
06:45 - just inspect him there we go so there he
06:49 - is right there
06:50 - so
06:51 - this first block
06:54 - is going to be that blue second block
06:57 - blue third fourth fifth all the way to
06:58 - 16th is all blue
07:01 - then we go down 1m
07:04 - blue blue blue blue guess what next one
07:07 - red
07:08 - red red red blue blue
07:12 - mario skin color mario skin color mario
07:14 - skin color
07:15 - you gotta kind of kind of get that so
07:17 - now let's go here and i'm just gonna
07:18 - start adding some numbers i'm gonna just
07:21 - blast through the first row of blue
07:24 - fast forward it
07:25 - and uh and then we'll start getting into
07:27 - just the first little bit of mario
07:29 - and then we'll take it from there so
07:31 - first line that
07:35 - 1m0 m and i'm going to copy that blue
07:38 - color there so the next one over this is
07:41 - x x axis and y-axis so this means it's
07:44 - going across horizontally this means
07:45 - it's going down so we're just going one
07:47 - over none down
07:50 - next one
07:51 - copy this whole line and i'm just going
07:53 - to say 2
07:55 - and 0.
07:56 - then three and zero then
07:59 - four and zero
08:02 - then five and zero we're going to do
08:04 - this all the way
08:05 - until you guessed it 15
08:08 - because we don't need to do the 16th
08:11 - and let's just blast through that now
08:16 - all right so i've got the first row here
08:19 - of blue you're not going to see it at
08:21 - all because it's just the background
08:23 - color
08:25 - so now what we're going to do is we're
08:26 - going to go down one row here
08:28 - uh one pixel on the y-axis and we're
08:31 - going to go over
08:32 - however many blocks that is until we get
08:34 - to the top of his head his hat so let's
08:37 - start that off
08:38 - comma and then we're going to go we're
08:41 - going down now to the next level so i'm
08:42 - going to give another space that maybe
08:44 - that will work just for visual purposes
08:46 - and now let's say
08:48 - we're going to go 0m and 1m blue again
08:54 - copy that we're gonna do that up until
08:56 - the fourth m
09:00 - one two three
09:03 - four
09:04 - that's all blue now you're not gonna see
09:06 - anything yet but now if i go with the
09:08 - next row
09:09 - or the next
09:11 - m over we're actually going to start
09:12 - with this hat so that's just going to be
09:14 - flat red so we're still now we're at 5 m
09:19 - and 1 m so we're one down and we're five
09:22 - over
09:23 - red
09:24 - let's just save that i want a semicolon
09:26 - and save that and see if we have
09:27 - anything
09:28 - bam we have the first official
09:32 - pixel of mario's hat now watch what
09:34 - happens when i add more
09:37 - and i'm gonna go
09:38 - over
09:39 - six
09:40 - and then just go seven all the way up
09:42 - until nine so seven
09:45 - save that semicolon at the end if you
09:47 - wanna view it
09:48 - look at that we've got the first
09:50 - sliver of his hat that part right there
09:52 - so the next couple are gonna be blue and
09:54 - then three of his skin tone so let's go
09:56 - ahead and do those together
09:59 - and then
10:00 - i'm gonna get you to keep going by
10:02 - yourself here but i'll give you the
10:03 - colors before you go so the next one is
10:06 - going to be 10
10:07 - it's going to be 10
10:10 - and 1 and that blue color so e7 ee f1
10:15 - we're going to do
10:16 - uh two of these so one
10:19 - two
10:20 - that's going to be eleven
10:22 - and now we're going to do the skin tone
10:25 - so let's go this will be 12
10:28 - 13 14 15.
10:31 - so that'll be 12 13
10:33 - 14 and 15. the skin tone that we have
10:36 - set here for mario
10:39 - uh is
10:40 - ffc
10:43 - 966. copy that paste it out a couple a
10:46 - few times there
10:48 - semicolon at the end to test save let's
10:50 - head over here look at this we've got
10:52 - the first layer so we've got first the
10:55 - first row and the second row which you
10:56 - can start to see it start to take shape
10:58 - that's what it will turn into this is
11:00 - what it is right here so let's quickly
11:03 - do the next one and then you're kind of
11:05 - on your own here i know i keep saying
11:07 - that but i'm just going to i'm just
11:08 - going to do that
11:09 - so we have just a bunch of red
11:12 - so we have from
11:14 - two down so we got we got we're at zero
11:17 - now and now we're at two so two down
11:19 - zero so you're at the left
11:21 - two m's down and red
11:24 - so now we're going to do this all the
11:25 - way up until
11:27 - 12 m
11:28 - and all red so 0
11:31 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. change those
11:35 - numbers out real quick
11:38 - and now save that semicolon at the end
11:41 - to test to save it head over
11:43 - now we should be
11:46 - [Music]
11:48 - okay uh we don't you can see here mario
11:51 - has a few blue pixels there and i put
11:53 - them all the way over there so i just
11:54 - need to change the first few from red
11:56 - and to that blue color
11:58 - the blue brand color so it's gonna be
12:00 - this one's gonna be that color
12:04 - then number two is gonna be that color
12:06 - and number three is gonna be that color
12:07 - save it head back over now we're talking
12:10 - now it is more like it needs to be the
12:13 - last couple here
12:14 - it even looks like perhaps the
12:18 - one two three four this one has one
12:22 - two
12:24 - three i think that's three
12:26 - yes that's three so this tone up here
12:30 - is actually going to be number 15 and
12:33 - one
12:33 - it's going to be that so it should look
12:35 - more like this
12:37 - there we go and now these two have to be
12:39 - the skin tone so
12:41 - you kind of guessed it here
12:44 - copy this do do this is going to change
12:46 - to that e7e
12:48 - ef1
12:50 - and
12:51 - these values are going to be 13 and 14.
12:56 - uh actually no that's not the skin tone
12:58 - the skin tone is ffc 966
13:02 - and then
13:03 - 15
13:04 - is e7 e ef1
13:08 - semicolon save that now we've officially
13:10 - got our second row you can see that it's
13:12 - starting to take shape so now what
13:14 - you're gonna do is go through and map
13:17 - these out yourself because obviously
13:18 - this would be the longest video ever if
13:20 - i'm going to write you know
13:22 - 300 lines of box shadows so i'm going to
13:26 - leave that up to you do it just actually
13:28 - do it and try it yourself and if you get
13:30 - bored you can you know move on but try
13:32 - it it's kind of an interesting challenge
13:34 - to
13:35 - you know go through this and map mario
13:37 - out
13:38 - now what i'm going to do is i'm just
13:40 - going to quickly fast forward this video
13:42 - have it be finished and then i'm going
13:43 - to show you how to do the wahoo button
13:45 - just because
13:46 - so i'm going to go ahead and do that uh
13:48 - before i'm actually going to give you
13:50 - the final colors so you can obviously go
13:52 - to the final css but brown is just brown
13:56 - there is just blue
13:59 - and yellow okay so you are okay and i
14:02 - believe that there is like a black in
14:03 - there for his eyes
14:06 - so those are your final colors you don't
14:08 - even need me to tell you what this
14:10 - this is you already got these colors
14:12 - this is brown this is
14:14 - um
14:15 - yellow this is blue and then that's
14:17 - black so you'll be fine now what i'm
14:20 - going to do is i'm going to fast forward
14:21 - this and i'm going to show you how to do
14:22 - the animation so here we go
14:26 - [Music]
14:37 - all right there is mario there is all
14:39 - the styles there the final box shadows
14:41 - there and so now what we're going to do
14:43 - is i'm just going to show you real quick
14:44 - how to do the uh the animation this one
14:46 - right here woohoo
14:48 - cool so we've done this before i think
14:50 - the animations it's just keyframes and
14:51 - animations is pretty straightforward so
14:53 - let's go ahead and do that i'm going to
14:55 - style it up here so it's easier to see
14:58 - and we're going to start off with uh
15:00 - wahoo is the id for the button outline
15:03 - none because i don't want that that ugly
15:05 - outline there so outline none
15:08 - and we're going to go and say
15:10 - wahoo
15:11 - active so when you are actively clicking
15:13 - it sibling selector uh it's going to be
15:16 - mario block we're selecting that and
15:18 - what we're going to do is say animation
15:21 - we're going to give an animation we're
15:22 - going to call it wahoo mario it's going
15:25 - to be a 0.8 seconds
15:27 - ease in out and loop it once
15:32 - and then we're just going to build a
15:34 - keyframe
15:36 - so keyframes
15:39 - and we're gonna call it wahoo mario
15:43 - and then at zero percent
15:46 - we're gonna say left zero
15:49 - bottom zero
15:51 - transform
15:52 - rotate and it's going to be zero at the
15:55 - beginning i'm going to copy this out
15:57 - paste paste paste change the percentages
15:59 - of the timeline to 30 percent
16:03 - 80 percent and 100 so at these different
16:06 - intervals this is where we're going to
16:07 - at these uh
16:09 - kind of stops we're going to do make the
16:11 - animation do something so it's going to
16:13 - go to 200 pixels
16:15 - left and 200 pixels from the bottom up
16:19 - it's going to rotate negative 25 degrees
16:22 - and 80 we're going to do 400 pixels
16:25 - bottom is going to be zero and then zero
16:28 - left is going to be uh 100 left to zero
16:30 - bottom is zero and transform we can just
16:33 - take that right out now if i save that
16:35 - and head back over here click the button
16:39 - just like that
16:40 - there is your mario awesome good job
16:43 - good job uh this was a doozy of a lesson
16:46 - like i said not really a practical
16:47 - application of css3 but i mean if
16:49 - anything you got to see that you could
16:50 - do some pretty cool things and then some
16:52 - animations you know mapping things out
16:54 - on grids it's pretty cool um
16:57 - i don't know how often you're going to
16:58 - be doing this sort of sort of thing it's
16:59 - more so just a challenge and just to
17:01 - show you this is kind of a cool thing so
17:03 - i hope you enjoyed that lesson we've got
17:05 - some more great stuff coming up for day
17:07 - nine
17:07 - thanks for hanging out with me for so
17:09 - long and
17:12 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to css3 in 30 days guess what's happening today we are going to be making an 8bit super mario with just css3 i'm not joking check it out over here we got day 8 8bit super mario or 8bit mario uh what's gonna happen here is check it out that that's what we're gonna make in css and then i just have this little kind of css animation when you click the wahoo button see something like that uh the sounds you have to provide yourself uh but that's what we're gonna be doing and so it's pretty interesting how it's done the html is beautifully simple and if only that were all you had to do then that would be pretty cool but the css is a little bit interesting and i'll show you why now keep in mind this isn't necessarily a practical use of css3 i don't know how many times i've ever been paid to make super mario in css except for now whoa let's head over to our course files here and download the 8bit number 8 8bit super mario project files you'll go ahead and do that and come back right here to this part of the video and what's going to happen here is we have our index sandbox and final css as usual here in the index check out the markup i'm going to go down to the final result here all we have is a button a div with the class of mario block and final mario i always prepend uh final double underscore for the final res uh the final css so let's go up to the sandbox this is all the markup you're going to be using so we have the button and this is mario here mario block and mario two divs that is pretty cool so how does this work let's go over to the browser again and i'm just going to inspect this and show you what's going on here super mario is in a div called mario block so here he is he's in a block it's 320 by 320. pixels i have it set up as 16m by 16m and we'll get into the measurements in a moment here in there we have final mario and there's simply just one line going across it's one by one block which is 20 by 20 pixels or um as we can see here 1m now you can see that there are 16 blocks going across that's because we've set up in final mario block 16 m so this is 16 by 16 which equates to 320 and 320 pixels in this case uh and so that means the container we're working with is 16 by 16. and each block of the mario pixel i guess we could say because he's an 8 bit so he's like a 16 pixel uh sort of thing the width is 1 m so we have 1 m and 16 of those fit across so final mario is officially just 1m by 1m and what we're doing here is using a bunch of box shadows you can see his colors here look at that that is hairy but that is how we do it we just have a box shadow that has multiple values separated by comma just putting the place in the colors on a grid so for example 0 and 0 is the top left and then 1 and zero is one m over and that you know it's at the top so it goes in that sort of grid like uh fashion so that is how we make mario using just box shadows so go over to your let me show you here in the final css you can see how it works we have box shadow and then a bunch of values now i'm not going to make you watch me code all these values out i'll get started to show you the pattern and then i'm going to leave it up to you to finish it now you're going to need to reference the effect the final version pretty pretty closely but keep in mind you're working on a grid a 16 by 16 grid you simply are just kind of painting by numbers or cssing by numbers let's jump into our sandbox let's go we'll get started with the basics so we're going to style the mario block that is the container wrapping it all we're going to say display inline block position relative margin 80 pixels auto width 16m height 16m the reason why we're using m's here is because the container within the mario block which is just called mario when we use m's it's r it's referencing the the size of its parent whereas when you're using ram it's relative to the root so with m it's relative to its parent so when i say 16 by 16 m that is the height and width of the mario block container you can see here in the browser we've got a container here that is in theory 16 by 16 m's now what we'll do is we will do basic styles here for just mario display block width 1m height 1m so now officially we have one let's call them pixels just for this moment they're not actual pixels this 1m block is going to be like one big ass pixel and there's 16 of them going across and 16 of them going down so now you just have to draw mario using box shadows within that so let's just say the background color will be the that blue background we have here in the container e7 double e f1 okay this is where the magic happens let's say box shadow and i'm gonna go zero m zero m and e seven e e f one so that is the first line that's the top left zero and zero is going to be that blue so what's gonna happen here is we want this here is here is mario this is officially his size right here let me just inspect him there we go so there he is right there so this first block is going to be that blue second block blue third fourth fifth all the way to 16th is all blue then we go down 1m blue blue blue blue guess what next one red red red red blue blue mario skin color mario skin color mario skin color you gotta kind of kind of get that so now let's go here and i'm just gonna start adding some numbers i'm gonna just blast through the first row of blue fast forward it and uh and then we'll start getting into just the first little bit of mario and then we'll take it from there so first line that 1m0 m and i'm going to copy that blue color there so the next one over this is x x axis and yaxis so this means it's going across horizontally this means it's going down so we're just going one over none down next one copy this whole line and i'm just going to say 2 and 0. then three and zero then four and zero then five and zero we're going to do this all the way until you guessed it 15 because we don't need to do the 16th and let's just blast through that now all right so i've got the first row here of blue you're not going to see it at all because it's just the background color so now what we're going to do is we're going to go down one row here uh one pixel on the yaxis and we're going to go over however many blocks that is until we get to the top of his head his hat so let's start that off comma and then we're going to go we're going down now to the next level so i'm going to give another space that maybe that will work just for visual purposes and now let's say we're going to go 0m and 1m blue again copy that we're gonna do that up until the fourth m one two three four that's all blue now you're not gonna see anything yet but now if i go with the next row or the next m over we're actually going to start with this hat so that's just going to be flat red so we're still now we're at 5 m and 1 m so we're one down and we're five over red let's just save that i want a semicolon and save that and see if we have anything bam we have the first official pixel of mario's hat now watch what happens when i add more and i'm gonna go over six and then just go seven all the way up until nine so seven save that semicolon at the end if you wanna view it look at that we've got the first sliver of his hat that part right there so the next couple are gonna be blue and then three of his skin tone so let's go ahead and do those together and then i'm gonna get you to keep going by yourself here but i'll give you the colors before you go so the next one is going to be 10 it's going to be 10 and 1 and that blue color so e7 ee f1 we're going to do uh two of these so one two that's going to be eleven and now we're going to do the skin tone so let's go this will be 12 13 14 15. so that'll be 12 13 14 and 15. the skin tone that we have set here for mario uh is ffc 966. copy that paste it out a couple a few times there semicolon at the end to test save let's head over here look at this we've got the first layer so we've got first the first row and the second row which you can start to see it start to take shape that's what it will turn into this is what it is right here so let's quickly do the next one and then you're kind of on your own here i know i keep saying that but i'm just going to i'm just going to do that so we have just a bunch of red so we have from two down so we got we got we're at zero now and now we're at two so two down zero so you're at the left two m's down and red so now we're going to do this all the way up until 12 m and all red so 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. change those numbers out real quick and now save that semicolon at the end to test to save it head over now we should be okay uh we don't you can see here mario has a few blue pixels there and i put them all the way over there so i just need to change the first few from red and to that blue color the blue brand color so it's gonna be this one's gonna be that color then number two is gonna be that color and number three is gonna be that color save it head back over now we're talking now it is more like it needs to be the last couple here it even looks like perhaps the one two three four this one has one two three i think that's three yes that's three so this tone up here is actually going to be number 15 and one it's going to be that so it should look more like this there we go and now these two have to be the skin tone so you kind of guessed it here copy this do do this is going to change to that e7e ef1 and these values are going to be 13 and 14. uh actually no that's not the skin tone the skin tone is ffc 966 and then 15 is e7 e ef1 semicolon save that now we've officially got our second row you can see that it's starting to take shape so now what you're gonna do is go through and map these out yourself because obviously this would be the longest video ever if i'm going to write you know 300 lines of box shadows so i'm going to leave that up to you do it just actually do it and try it yourself and if you get bored you can you know move on but try it it's kind of an interesting challenge to you know go through this and map mario out now what i'm going to do is i'm just going to quickly fast forward this video have it be finished and then i'm going to show you how to do the wahoo button just because so i'm going to go ahead and do that uh before i'm actually going to give you the final colors so you can obviously go to the final css but brown is just brown there is just blue and yellow okay so you are okay and i believe that there is like a black in there for his eyes so those are your final colors you don't even need me to tell you what this this is you already got these colors this is brown this is um yellow this is blue and then that's black so you'll be fine now what i'm going to do is i'm going to fast forward this and i'm going to show you how to do the animation so here we go all right there is mario there is all the styles there the final box shadows there and so now what we're going to do is i'm just going to show you real quick how to do the uh the animation this one right here woohoo cool so we've done this before i think the animations it's just keyframes and animations is pretty straightforward so let's go ahead and do that i'm going to style it up here so it's easier to see and we're going to start off with uh wahoo is the id for the button outline none because i don't want that that ugly outline there so outline none and we're going to go and say wahoo active so when you are actively clicking it sibling selector uh it's going to be mario block we're selecting that and what we're going to do is say animation we're going to give an animation we're going to call it wahoo mario it's going to be a 0.8 seconds ease in out and loop it once and then we're just going to build a keyframe so keyframes and we're gonna call it wahoo mario and then at zero percent we're gonna say left zero bottom zero transform rotate and it's going to be zero at the beginning i'm going to copy this out paste paste paste change the percentages of the timeline to 30 percent 80 percent and 100 so at these different intervals this is where we're going to at these uh kind of stops we're going to do make the animation do something so it's going to go to 200 pixels left and 200 pixels from the bottom up it's going to rotate negative 25 degrees and 80 we're going to do 400 pixels bottom is going to be zero and then zero left is going to be uh 100 left to zero bottom is zero and transform we can just take that right out now if i save that and head back over here click the button just like that there is your mario awesome good job good job uh this was a doozy of a lesson like i said not really a practical application of css3 but i mean if anything you got to see that you could do some pretty cool things and then some animations you know mapping things out on grids it's pretty cool um i don't know how often you're going to be doing this sort of sort of thing it's more so just a challenge and just to show you this is kind of a cool thing so i hope you enjoyed that lesson we've got some more great stuff coming up for day nine thanks for hanging out with me for so long and
