With timestamps:

00:17 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:20 - with Jessie and let me know if you can
00:26 - see the the video and everything all
00:30 - right if I'm actually moving because
00:32 - something's wrong with my preview and
00:34 - it's frozen so I don't know if it's just
00:37 - me or if it's happening for everybody
00:48 - so I'm just gonna wait a few seconds
00:51 - just to get confirmation as to whether
00:53 - or not my video okay cool
00:55 - video must be cool I figured it was me
00:59 - cuz I can't play any YouTube videos
01:01 - right now on my computer I probably just
01:04 - need to restart my browser
01:06 - that's happened before not frequently
01:08 - but it has happened let's see
01:15 - so today I've decided to be really
01:19 - ambitious and I'm gonna try to set up
01:22 - graph QL to work with WordPress and I've
01:25 - never done that before
01:26 - I've never worked with graph QL at all
01:28 - before so but I know I want to learn how
01:33 - to do it so we're gonna we're gonna try
01:39 - it out I've done a little bit of
01:42 - research about this earlier today but
01:47 - most of my time has been taken up
01:49 - working on the catechetical Institute
01:51 - website that was project one that we did
01:54 - just minor updates though and some just
02:00 - some basic things so I figured that
02:02 - wasn't really worth putting on a stream
02:06 - alright I got a lot of people in the
02:08 - live chat so I'm gonna say hi before we
02:10 - start coding
02:11 - hey everybody okay cowboy says there
02:20 - might be audio interference okay let me
02:23 - know okay Evo actually has a graph QL
02:31 - API prototype so yeah definitely I'd
02:35 - love to have that link so send it I mean
02:40 - you can't really post links in the live
02:42 - chat but you can direct message me on
02:44 - Twitter or whatever social media you're
02:46 - on that you want to message me on that's
02:48 - cool let's see
02:54 - alright let's get started a couple of
03:00 - like a couple of things
03:02 - Oh for the last two streams I've forgot
03:06 - to thank some people who have submitted
03:10 - pool requests this past week so I'm just
03:13 - gonna do it right now so I don't forget
03:15 - because I'm pretty sure I will forget
03:17 - again if I try to put it off so I'm
03:21 - pretty sure I have those up here yeah
03:30 - okay cool so I'm not gonna spend a lot
03:33 - of time going over those you definitely
03:35 - can check them out yourself and this
03:38 - isn't a private repo so this is the
03:39 - Resource Center project too so we have
03:47 - okay we had to for some reason I thought
03:50 - we had more pool requests but we have to
03:53 - let me refresh just to be sure I'm not
03:55 - missing one all right there we go we
03:57 - have three that's what I thought okay so
04:00 - Matt did some fix some warnings we'll
04:06 - just click into it briefly so obviously
04:09 - you can read this if you want and check
04:10 - out what's changed but I had when I had
04:15 - implemented Google Analytics I had a lot
04:19 - of repetitive the Annette function for
04:24 - Google Analytics was just I put it how
04:27 - to put in every component so the way I
04:28 - did it was not the best way in terms of
04:32 - you know trying not to repeat myself a
04:34 - lot so Matt clean that up which is
04:37 - awesome so also found a spot where I had
04:42 - basically had two functions doing the
04:44 - exact same thing right next to each
04:46 - other didn't even realize it
04:47 - so he cleaned that up for me as well and
04:52 - then Sebastian had to pull requests so
04:55 - there was some stuff going on with our
04:57 - forms and just some warnings and things
05:03 - that got cleaned up and also he noted
05:06 - some some UI things in Firefox which I
05:09 - didn't I I did very minimal testing in
05:13 - Firefox I I can't even remember how much
05:17 - testing I didn't Firefox it's it's
05:19 - entirely possible that I just didn't
05:21 - test it at all so anyway they found some
05:25 - stuff in Firefox and fix that so really
05:29 - nice little bit of CSS cleanup and
05:33 - finally this is some really cool stuff
05:38 - so on Android added in some information
05:43 - basically to to let Android know how to
05:46 - display it how to display the app so I
05:51 - wonder it's going to be hard to see this
05:54 - so I'm gonna try it out anyway let me
05:56 - see the screen so up in actually let me
06:02 - let me make this but you trying to make
06:06 - this bigger for a minute
06:09 - you see if I can there we go
06:12 - alright so right here we have our icon
06:18 - for the Resource Center and I'm gonna
06:20 - throw this into airplane mode so it's an
06:27 - airplane mode right now I don't know if
06:28 - you can see the airplane but I'm gonna
06:29 - click it we get this screen I have the
06:33 - glares kind of rough on here so I don't
06:35 - know if you'll be able to see it let me
06:38 - go to a darker screen maybe to cut the
06:40 - glare but anyway big lit yeah there's
06:43 - really bad but this is the resource
06:44 - center it works like right now I clicked
06:47 - on the logos page and we're completely
06:48 - offline which is awesome so I don't know
06:54 - that anybody here at the University will
06:56 - ever even try that out because I mean we
07:01 - have any people at the university that
07:02 - still want us to like mail them things
07:05 - like on paper and have no interest in
07:10 - using the Internet at all or computers
07:13 - so I don't know how many people who
07:15 - appreciate that but I definitely
07:16 - appreciate it also if you go
07:18 - they're in Chrome the bar at the top now
07:21 - is the Franciscan green color so anyway
07:25 - that was just that was really cool I am
07:27 - I checked that I was showing people I
07:30 - showed I should the guy that works in
07:32 - the office next to me and I went home
07:35 - and showed my wife and because I was I
07:39 - was super excited about it
07:41 - so all right so anyway thank you Matt
07:47 - thanks Sebastian those were awesome pool
07:49 - requests I appreciate that and now now
07:56 - we're gonna get started with with some
08:00 - graph QL so let me go let's see we're
08:07 - gonna start with this I'm gonna go over
08:12 - to where we have our code for this
08:14 - project but we're probably not gonna put
08:17 - that much yeah we're probably you're not
08:22 - gonna do that much with with this code
08:24 - today what we're gonna be doing is you
08:28 - know trying to set up our WordPress to
08:32 - work with graph QL
08:40 - let's let me get my Pomodoro clock going
08:43 - so I'm gonna do 25 minutes of coding and
08:46 - then after that I'll take a five-minute
08:50 - break I'll go over the questions in the
08:52 - live chat then we'll do another
08:54 - 25-minute session and we'll do at least
08:58 - two 25-minute sessions after that we'll
09:01 - see how it's going maybe we do some more
09:02 - coding or maybe we'll just do a question
09:05 - and an answer but at least probably get
09:09 - in about an hour and our code okay all
09:16 - right so what I'm from what I've looked
09:19 - up so far and if anybody has experience
09:22 - with this put it in the live chat I'll
09:24 - try to keep an eye on the live chat to
09:26 - see if anybody's putting in some advice
09:29 - for that but from what I've seen so far
09:36 - a few other people have worked on this
09:38 - so we may not have to do this from
09:41 - scratch it's entirely possible that we
09:43 - could just pull something from github
09:45 - that'll get us started so oops I didn't
09:52 - even start my time all right so I'm
09:59 - gonna pull over some of the projects on
10:03 - github that I've been looking at I'll
10:07 - pull it over under this screen just so
10:10 - you all can see what I'm thinking about
10:13 - using
10:19 - so these are our two really different
10:22 - approaches and they're not let's see
10:27 - so this one is act actually actively
10:31 - maintained this one not so much
10:34 - but I know that it's probably hard to
10:38 - see everything the way I have these
10:41 - windows up but I'll just kind of briefly
10:43 - describe what what's going on with these
10:48 - this is more like configuring like an
10:53 - entire separate server to to run graph
10:59 - QL and then it's going to pull data
11:01 - directly from the my sequel database
11:04 - using I believe they're using sequel
11:07 - eyes to help with that okay so this one
11:09 - seems like it's a little bit more
11:11 - involved this project seems to be more
11:16 - like a wordpress plugin I haven't had
11:20 - time to read through all of it but
11:22 - that's the impression that I got from a
11:25 - little bit that I did read so it seems
11:31 - like of the two the one on the left here
11:34 - this what's it called WP graph QL would
11:41 - probably be the one that's that's a bit
11:43 - more simple to work with so I don't know
11:49 - let's let me give everyone just a minute
11:55 - or so I want to know what you all think
12:00 - if any of you have used either of these
12:03 - before if you have any any advice for me
12:06 - or if there's something else out there
12:07 - that I'm not aware of that I should
12:09 - check out so we'll give it a minute
12:11 - depending on on what said in the live
12:15 - chat I may go with something else but
12:17 - otherwise I think I'll probably try this
12:19 - one out first because it's more up to
12:22 - date and it seems seems like it'll be
12:25 - the quicker of the two so while I'm
12:30 - waiting for the
12:32 - delay and the responses I'm just going
12:35 - to explain briefly why I want to go with
12:37 - graph QL and WordPress so for this
12:40 - project in particular we already have a
12:42 - lot of data in WordPress that I want to
12:45 - bring in so that's why I'm doing
12:48 - WordPress I don't want to migrate any of
12:50 - that data the people that are in charge
12:51 - of putting that data in are already
12:53 - trained on how to do it in WordPress so
12:55 - I don't want to mess up their workflow
12:57 - having said that we've worked with the
13:00 - WordPress API in the past and it
13:02 - definitely works it works well but graph
13:06 - QL because it will enable us to in one
13:10 - API call hit all the end points that we
13:13 - need get all the data that we need and
13:15 - only the data that we need I think it
13:17 - would be a lot more efficient to do it
13:19 - that way so that's why I want to switch
13:23 - to graph QL the other reason is as I
13:26 - mentioned you know right away in the
13:29 - stream I really want to learn how to
13:31 - work with it on how to use it I've
13:34 - talked before about all these smaller
13:36 - projects contributing to the larger
13:40 - project which is redesigning the main
13:42 - university website and one of the things
13:45 - that I do would like to use for that
13:47 - website is graph QL because I don't want
13:50 - to have to have a lot of different API
13:52 - calls happening for every single page so
13:57 - this is gonna you know work up to that
14:00 - so do we absolutely need graph queue up
14:02 - for this project no we don't but if I
14:05 - don't have it then this project would
14:06 - basically be pretty much the same as
14:09 - what we had done for for project one so
14:13 - I'd hate to just have a repeat of that
14:17 - we would have a few different things but
14:19 - I think this would be better you know be
14:22 - better for me for learning and then you
14:25 - know better for you all I think just to
14:27 - have some exposure to graph QL if you
14:29 - don't already all right so enough time
14:33 - has gone by that I'm the delay is is
14:36 - dealt with now so I'm gonna check the
14:38 - live chat and then we'll be started okay
14:47 - okay so Arielle says it seems like the
14:54 - one on the left is mostly PHP and the
14:56 - one on the right is JavaScript yeah that
15:01 - was the impression that I got I'm I'm a
15:03 - little bit nervous about that so this
15:06 - one is mostly PHP and for this we're
15:11 - getting yeah JavaScript I'm a little
15:13 - nervous about that because I'm
15:17 - definitely better at JavaScript that I
15:19 - am with with PHP so here's what we'll do
15:23 - I'm gonna scroll through just the basic
15:25 - setup options and if a lot of it is
15:28 - confusing to me then we'll just move on
15:30 - and maybe go with this because well I
15:34 - think this one will be faster to set up
15:36 - if it's all in PHP and things that I
15:40 - don't understand it probably and it
15:42 - won't be faster just because of my
15:45 - inexperience with it all right so let's
15:49 - let's scroll a bit let's see
16:05 - was this did you see any setup
16:09 - instructions there
16:16 - am I missing something because I didn't
16:18 - I didn't see anything
16:21 - what okay that was it
16:24 - download and install like any WordPress
16:27 - plug-in off alright well that's that's
16:32 - super easy okay
16:34 - well that's worth the try if we just
16:37 - have to install it like any WordPress
16:39 - plug-in then I'm I'm fine with that
16:43 - that's that's easy so I think it's worth
16:47 - a shot to just install this plug-in and
16:49 - see what it's like if it doesn't work
16:51 - for what we're trying to do we can go
16:53 - with something else but otherwise this
16:56 - is probably going to save a lot of time
17:01 - and I'm just going to move this over the
17:05 - other stream but I want to keep this
17:07 - ready in case that this other one
17:10 - doesn't work out
17:20 - okay so we're
17:43 - I'm I'm guessing the entire thing then
17:46 - it's gets installed all right I will
17:53 - need a zip file for this so let's
17:56 - download the zip and then let's log in
18:08 - to log into the same the same WordPress
18:18 - install that we're using for the content
18:21 - right now that we worked with yesterday
18:33 - and that is just my might say we're
18:37 - gonna use Jessie waggle calm and I'm not
18:43 - really actively updating this site
18:46 - anymore or using it for anything so if
18:49 - this messes it up I'm I'm not really
18:52 - worried about it that'll just be
18:55 - incentive for me to actually update it
18:59 - okay I guess I'll I'll pull this over so
19:07 - you all can see if you've never updated
19:10 - let's make it bigger updated a plugin so
19:14 - there are different ways you can add a
19:16 - plug-in to WordPress so one of the ways
19:18 - is through the admin panel here you
19:22 - could also just access the files
19:25 - directly and then just drop your file
19:27 - into the plugins folder so for right now
19:32 - I think this will be the quickest way to
19:34 - do it where my plugins we're going to
19:39 - add a new plug-in and
19:45 - yeah it's update all right now I don't
19:50 - want update this right now
19:51 - in case it messes up no weird all right
19:55 - so we're gonna upload a plugin so we
19:57 - needed an zip format so that's why we I
19:59 - did the zip earlier and where we get
20:07 - downloads
20:09 - okay
20:18 - see how this goes cool let's activate
20:22 - the plugin and words to that cool so we
20:33 - have our graph QL API set up I was
20:41 - looking to see if I have any extra
20:42 - options here it doesn't look like it so
20:45 - so I guess there's no configuration
20:48 - screen or anything okay now let's see
20:55 - about getting some data just to make
20:57 - sure it's working
21:12 - I don't want to have to download a graph
21:14 - QL desktop thing right now there's got
21:17 - to be a website I can use
21:24 - does anybody know of a website I can go
21:27 - to quickly to test out graph QL
21:36 - okay let's see
22:01 - okay
22:06 - which is gonna be your side day long /
22:08 - graphic you though okay
22:22 - okay
22:50 - and I'm still trying to find a way to
22:52 - test this
23:23 - here we go I think I found a browser
23:25 - client
23:58 - okay sorry I wasn't checking out the the
24:03 - live chat I'm gonna test out some of the
24:07 - the things you all mentioned the la chat
24:35 - okay
25:24 - all right so I'm not I'm not getting
25:27 - anything to work right now I guess I
25:29 - could just go ahead and do this because
25:31 - uh oh okay I can just install this with
25:38 - homebrew so let's do that cuz that's
25:40 - gonna be easy or the Chrome extension
25:44 - yeah the Chrome extension might be
25:46 - easier
25:55 - all right
26:05 - set em points
26:16 - let's see if it works
26:21 - uh-uh I don't think it did alright so I
26:28 - don't think we're getting what we're
26:30 - supposed to be getting
26:33 - so yeah the endpoint is supposed to be
26:37 - such graphic oh all right
26:56 - yeah so we so we have dogs
27:10 - all right let's check out the ducks and
27:19 - okay
27:23 - all right we need to flush the
27:25 - permalinks would have been nice if they
27:26 - put that on the on the github repo read
27:31 - me all right it's the settings
27:39 - performance those fees paid okay all
27:46 - right so let's do that
27:47 - settings permalinks
28:06 - all right I think if I just flip it flip
28:10 - the settings that should work all right
28:18 - let's shut again
28:22 - yep well it's we had a different error
28:36 - alright let's see I need
28:52 - and see
29:01 - all right so here's what I have now so I
29:03 - need to put in a query basically which
29:09 - next step I guess is figure out how to
29:12 - do a query with graph QL so let's see
29:35 - I don't want to watch I don't want to
29:39 - watch a video there's no text that goes
29:41 - along with it all right
29:52 - okay so we can we can't add things with
29:57 - this that's good Lefty's PHP
30:11 - okay
30:18 - okay I see Kevin says the fonts pretty
30:21 - small so I'll I'll make sure a zoom in
30:28 - on things we're doing it
30:41 - all right this looks nice real basics
30:45 - it's what query okay
31:08 - all right a few more minutes then we'll
31:09 - do the question/answer let's see I'm not
31:18 - sure what this data is is looking is
31:20 - gonna look like
31:31 - so maybe what was this one again let's
31:38 - just copy something see what happens I
31:48 - guess we don't need it
31:55 - we'll paste that in see what happens
32:10 - now they
32:23 - let's check
32:34 - the post
32:37 - I need I really need to know what the
32:46 - with date I'm dealing with
33:03 - I guess I will need to check this video
33:11 - today once you graduate you can point it
33:14 - at your size calculate and planning for
33:16 - us documentation to started
33:29 - I'm just gonna watch enough of this to
33:32 - get I don't know YouTube videos but I
33:40 - said earlier YouTube videos aren't
33:41 - playing alright but actually this this
33:46 - should be enough create those alright
33:52 - let's just create those all right cool
33:59 - let's try that
34:17 - see if this oops see if this works
34:35 - must have a sub selection all right so
34:38 - chef selection those edges all right let
34:46 - me move this over so I can type it out
34:53 - all right so we're gonna try to get some
34:58 - posts here
35:09 - not data date
35:21 - all right awesome okay so here's what we
35:26 - put in here basically we're asking for
35:29 - posts as far as edges a node are
35:32 - concerned I have no idea what that's
35:34 - talking about right now it's just in the
35:36 - demo video that's what they typed in but
35:39 - then down here I've just specified which
35:45 - which items I wanted so which pieces of
35:47 - data about the posts I wanted so we
35:52 - should just get back these ones so let's
35:54 - see we did get back all right so within
35:57 - posts edges
35:59 - I guess we're we're getting all these
36:01 - nodes right so we did we just got ID
36:04 - date title and slug great and then to
36:10 - compare we had a legacy side by side
36:16 - what we get from the rest API and then
36:19 - we get from graph QL so let me find you
36:25 - find where we had this pretty sure I had
36:29 - it on this screen yep here it is okay so
36:36 - let me try to do my best to get these
36:39 - side-by-side and my my timer ran out so
36:48 - we're gonna take our five-minute break
36:49 - as soon as we just seen this side by
36:50 - side so this is the same data for the
36:55 - most part between graph QL on the left
36:59 - and the rest API on the right you can
37:02 - see by default the rest API gives us
37:04 - everything right so each one of these
37:08 - posts has all of this data that was just
37:11 - one post over here the same post is this
37:18 - right so by default they're basically
37:21 - there is no default it's whatever we
37:23 - whatever we ask for so we've been able
37:27 - to get exactly what we want based on a
37:30 - query like this so you can see
37:35 - a lot less data now but previous project
37:40 - we have found ways to cut down on this
37:43 - data but whenever we try to limit our
37:47 - API calls then we couldn't filter out
37:49 - our data like we wanted so there wasn't
37:53 - a good way to both use only one API call
37:57 - per page and limit the data we're
38:01 - getting for each API call so that was
38:04 - our that was the dilemma that we faced
38:06 - in project 2 and we ended up going with
38:11 - using one API call even though we were
38:14 - pulling in more data than we needed to
38:18 - so with graph QL we shouldn't have to
38:22 - make that decision we should be able to
38:24 - do both use one API call and at the same
38:28 - time get only the data that we need all
38:30 - right
38:31 - so let me start my five minutes himer
38:33 - we're going to do question answers for
38:35 - five minutes and then we'll go back to
38:36 - another 25 minutes of coding at this
38:38 - point it's really I mean we have a graph
38:41 - QL API up and running so we're going to
38:44 - move back to our react project and try
38:47 - to pull that data in and we want to get
38:51 - that into our Redux store so let me find
38:55 - the live chats and I'm gonna scroll up
39:04 - and let's see so I'm getting distracted
39:08 - there's a lot of messages coming over my
39:10 - slack at work I don't think any of them
39:16 - are super important for me I just want a
39:19 - glance just to make sure okay I'm like
39:24 - I'm the only person that really has
39:26 - access and knows about some of our sites
39:30 - that are kind of important so that's why
39:32 - I still I glanced at that because if an
39:35 - emergency happened I I would probably be
39:38 - the only person that could fix it all so
39:44 - here's a fun fact I learned on slack orb
39:48 - right before the stream started that the
39:50 - person who works in the office right
39:52 - next to me used to hang out with a
39:54 - member of the wu-tang clan so he's now
39:58 - the coolest person I know I don't know
40:04 - if we have any wu-tang fans in here but
40:05 - I thought that was kind of cool okay all
40:13 - right I'm trying to find the questions
40:15 - there's a it's quite a bit in the live
40:17 - chat today okay so we had a question
40:24 - about did you fix the slack link I can't
40:26 - find in the description all right I'm
40:28 - glad you brought that up because I
40:29 - completely forgot about it I remove the
40:31 - slack length from the description
40:33 - because basically it didn't work so from
40:39 - I have no idea where that original link
40:43 - came from it says that that links
40:46 - expired and we need to get a new link
40:48 - but I don't know how to get that link
40:50 - from slack so if anybody is more
40:52 - familiar with slack or whoever got that
40:54 - original link if you're watching right
40:57 - now let me know how I can get another
41:02 - link if that's even possible the other
41:06 - alternative I guess would be manually
41:11 - sending out invites so I would just I
41:14 - guess I could say anybody that wants in
41:16 - slack channel let me know and then I can
41:20 - just send you an invite based on your
41:22 - email address so you just have to give
41:23 - me your email address through whatever
41:25 - you know channel you want to give that
41:27 - to me and I can invite you I mean that
41:30 - method will work for sure but it would
41:32 - definitely be more convenient for
41:34 - everyone if if we could get the link
41:36 - working so so that's where the the slack
41:41 - link situation is at right now okay also
41:48 - I didn't start our our serve our end
41:51 - grukk server I'm gonna do that right now
41:53 - so since we're gonna be working with
41:56 - this with the react app now you all can
42:02 - go in there let me post it post the URL
42:14 - okay so that's personal live chat now so
42:18 - if you want to go there we haven't done
42:19 - anything with it yet but we will be
42:22 - working with it soon so you want to go
42:25 - there you can check it out
42:26 - not much there at this point
42:50 - okay it looks like some of you were
42:53 - talking about the progressive web app to
42:57 - the last project that I demoed at the
43:00 - beginning on my phone there the Resource
43:03 - Center yeah so create react app comes
43:06 - with a serviceworker and and that's
43:08 - basically what allows it to operate like
43:12 - that a progressive web app so so you
43:17 - would want of your app to have some
43:19 - functionality even offline and then as
43:21 - you get a better connection it
43:25 - progressively has more capabilities so
43:30 - for instance obviously offline you can't
43:32 - submit the form but if you're offline
43:34 - you could still read all the content so
43:40 - you have this core functionality in your
43:43 - app that always works in your web page
43:46 - that will work no matter what so that's
43:48 - the idea of a progressive web app
43:50 - although I was thinking I'm probably not
43:52 - gonna do it right now but it's possible
43:55 - that we could get the form data and save
43:58 - the form data until we did have an
44:01 - internet connection and then send it at
44:03 - that point so I've seen similar things
44:07 - done before like I said I don't I don't
44:10 - know that anybody is going to be using
44:11 - it like that and using it offline so I
44:14 - don't know that it's it's a good use of
44:16 - my time here at work but it would be
44:19 - kind of a cool thing to do on the side
44:21 - just to get it working so we would we
44:25 - would need to store that data may be in
44:27 - local storage I don't know we somehow
44:30 - we'd store that data and then just try
44:33 - to detect whenever we got a network
44:35 - connection and and then send it at that
44:38 - point
44:45 - okay Rowland said try Visor you can
44:47 - mirror your phone on your desktop I
44:49 - actually do a visor installed I just I
44:52 - act I hadn't even planned on showing
44:53 - that so I didn't have it have it ready
44:56 - but I'll remember next time if I'm
44:58 - planning on doing something with on my
45:02 - phone I'll have a better set up Marco
45:09 - says so create react app automatically
45:11 - makes the basic progressive web app yeah
45:14 - pretty much yeah so you so by default
45:19 - create react app is his progressive web
45:24 - app depending on how you build it I'm
45:26 - sure you can make it better or worse at
45:31 - being a progressive web app but the
45:34 - Resource Center is actually not bad like
45:35 - I said the forms obviously don't work it
45:38 - seems like some of the the images and
45:43 - everything we're still on there so that
45:47 - that was pretty cool that that worked
45:53 - well excuse me
45:55 - yawning so yeah some of the images
46:00 - worked I think it just depended on what
46:01 - actually got loaded before I put it on
46:04 - airplane mode so I was able to load the
46:07 - logos but I didn't get some of the
46:09 - images from the other pages okay all
46:16 - right so my five minutes is up I don't
46:18 - know how long it's been up for I just
46:20 - checked so I'm still not getting the
46:22 - beeping in my headphones when that's up
46:24 - so I don't I don't know what the problem
46:26 - is I probably just need to restart my my
46:32 - browser it's been quite a while since
46:34 - I've done that so let me mark down where
46:38 - I left off at and the latch
46:46 - okay
47:01 - all right so another 25-minute session
47:04 - and then after that we'll we'll see if
47:07 - we're gonna code more and I forgot that
47:11 - I had covered this up again so let me
47:13 - move that up there we go
47:16 - I had just assumed you all could see the
47:18 - timer keep forgetting that my my face is
47:24 - in that corner okay let's move this out
47:27 - of the way well I guess we have we have
47:31 - this here so we'll we'll keep this here
47:36 - now here's what we need to do so we need
47:39 - some way to bring in this graph QL data
47:42 - so from what I understand a lot of
47:47 - people use something called Apollo to
47:50 - make it easier to work with data let me
47:53 - know if if Apollo is suitable for this
47:59 - if you know of something better
48:01 - otherwise I'm going to try to install
48:04 - Apollo now and and get that working
48:27 - okay so harsh it says react Apollo and
48:29 - relay so do I use relay with Apollo or
48:33 - is it I could use either relay or Apollo
48:37 - I have reacts Apollo up on github right
48:42 - now
49:02 - hmm
49:06 - okay so it's either relay or Apollo the
49:11 - Helio thinks Apollo is the easiest to
49:15 - start working with okay all right cool
49:18 - let's start with Apollo is anybody at
49:20 - experience using Apollo with redux
49:33 - it should I even be worried about that
49:35 - or should I use something else
50:04 - okay so Helio does have experience with
50:09 - using Apollo and redux okay cool
50:23 - all right so let's install Apollo let me
50:26 - find my my terminal where am I there we
50:32 - go okay so I just had to get up they
50:40 - jump and what I do it alright so we're
50:47 - gonna do yarn add Apollo or reactive
50:54 - part
50:54 - Apollo sorry should I'd like to I'm
51:04 - interested in seeing what you all think
51:06 - do you like it better when we do streams
51:09 - like this where I'm completely clueless
51:11 - and we work our way through it together
51:13 - or do you like it better when I have it
51:17 - a better idea of what I'm doing and it's
51:21 - more like me getting everything done and
51:23 - just kind of narrating what I'm doing it
51:28 - doesn't have to be either/or we can
51:29 - always have a mix of the different types
51:32 - of of streams but if it's like
51:36 - overwhelming that you all like or don't
51:39 - like one or the other then I'll keep
51:42 - that in mind okay cool so we have this
51:46 - and let's let's see I'll bring this over
51:55 - here so this is what I'm looking at
51:58 - right now so it looks like we need to
52:02 - wrap our root component in this Apollo
52:08 - okay
52:10 - all right great let's see pretty direct
52:15 - component this component works almost
52:16 - the same as provider community react
52:18 - reacts affects you that's a store
52:20 - property new Apollo provider and also
52:22 - service provider for react redux okay
52:24 - great so it looks like we can replace
52:27 - our provider component with Apollo
52:31 - provider and it should work fine
52:34 - with with what we have set
52:37 - with Redux anyway cool so I'm going to
52:40 - move this over to the other screen and
52:44 - let's let's hook this up just go into
52:49 - our app and well first things first
52:52 - let's import what we need to import is
53:01 - where we get you if it's import follow
53:16 - Apolo client
53:23 - back to Paula and then
53:41 - if you want to follow along with these
53:43 - instructions I'm just on the react
53:45 - Apolo github repository okay alright so
53:52 - we've made a new Apollo client and now
54:00 - let's give it some instructions here
54:08 - network interface
54:22 - okay so here's what we'll put in the the
54:30 - route to our graph QL code you know our
54:34 - demo that we just set up okay so
54:45 - obviously if you're doing this on your
54:47 - project you you'd want to put in
54:52 - whatever whatever yours is or if I mean
54:57 - if you want to use mine as an example
54:58 - just to get started I don't I don't know
55:00 - the care you can do that as well okay
55:03 - great now let's hook this in to our
55:07 - provider so our provider is now going to
55:11 - be our Apollo provider and we need to
55:19 - add in client that we just made up there
55:24 - I entered passing the client and then
55:28 - since we're gonna pass in store as well
55:30 - based on the documentation it seems like
55:33 - that that will still work with what
55:36 - we're trying to do with redux so let me
55:37 - save that and
55:56 - all right well first thing let's just
55:58 - make sure we don't have any errors when
55:59 - we do have errors polar provider is not
56:03 - defined did we forget to do this I guess
56:08 - we probably forgot to import it yep we
56:14 - did forget to import it
56:29 - create a network interface is not to
56:31 - find out it
56:46 - I hope I forgot to import that too I
56:49 - don't know what I was thinking it's it's
56:51 - right there in the in the documentation
56:54 - I just I just didn't see it
57:05 - okay cool so obviously we're not seeing
57:11 - any difference but we're not getting any
57:13 - air is so now we can move on ahead to
57:15 - the next step okay all right so let me
57:22 - bring this back over for just for a
57:25 - minute so we can at this point pull in
57:32 - or it's like we can connect graph QL
57:36 - into our components but I don't think
57:39 - that's what we want to do I'm thinking
57:45 - that instead hmm sorry
57:51 - instead we would want the data to go
57:54 - into our store and then to go into our
57:59 - components from the store so I guess
58:05 - that's that's what we need to figure out
58:09 - how to do so let me bring up the the
58:15 - complete reference
58:27 - I'm just scanning really quickly just to
58:30 - see if this
58:48 - okay so here's everything let's see if
58:50 - they have anything specifically on Redux
58:53 - integrating with Redux awesome
58:56 - okay so we've already connected the
59:00 - store which yep connect the store and
59:11 - area this is what what we need this is
59:15 - really small so let me zoom in okay so
59:21 - so we're gonna keep we're gonna use
59:23 - connects though
59:31 - let's see how they how they say to do
59:33 - this
60:05 - okay I guess we could try putting some
60:09 - of this in our in our component now I'm
60:12 - not a hundred percent sure this is what
60:14 - I was thinking that we would do but
60:17 - let's at least give it a shot just to
60:20 - confirm that we've hooked everything up
60:22 - properly see if we can get some data to
60:24 - display so
60:59 - I wish I could see what the actions were
61:25 - production graph QL all right this is
61:28 - not using Apollo let me close this out I
61:32 - think I want another example so let's go
61:48 - that's for you
61:52 - all right
62:33 - actually they it looks like they were
62:35 - placing Redux with Apollo that's not
62:37 - what we want to do
62:47 - yeah I don't want to do that
63:01 - mmm this might not be up-to-date
63:23 - okay this is actually more it looks like
63:25 - it's it's more like what I want to do
63:47 - okay I wasn't super helpful but better
63:55 - idea okay let me check the time all
64:01 - right
64:01 - eight minutes let's see if we can get
64:03 - something to display in eight minutes
64:08 - all right let me move this off the side
64:10 - so I can reference it
64:18 - let's go back here to our home component
64:24 - and let's bring in I'm gonna do some
64:28 - copy and pasting just to save time
64:30 - instead of typing it out bring in graph
64:36 - QL and
65:27 - hmm
65:39 - alright I'm a little bit I'm not
65:41 - confident that I can get something to
65:43 - display in probably what is it six
65:46 - minutes now okay
65:54 - so let's at least just think this out
66:00 - maybe personal comments and so we can
66:02 - start from the same point tomorrow I I
66:07 - know that were the example that I saw in
66:10 - the documentation had an important graph
66:13 - QL here but realistically I was thinking
66:16 - more along the lines of I guess having
66:21 - graph QL in here really I'm sorry not in
66:25 - where am I looking more like in
66:28 - something like this so that when we
66:32 - dispatch an action then instead of
66:35 - making the API call to the REST API it
66:39 - would grab the data from from the graph
66:43 - QL API which would then get stored in
66:49 - the redux store now it seems like that's
66:53 - not really how Apollo works if that's
66:58 - the case then I think I need to do some
67:01 - tutorials on Apollo just to get an idea
67:05 - of how that works and see and see how we
67:10 - should be using it if for anybody that
67:16 - has worked with Apollo if I'm mistaking
67:18 - if I'm mistaken here please let me know
67:20 - but I was I was kind of assuming that
67:25 - basically Apollo would just let me do
67:29 - the same thing that I'm doing here with
67:31 - fetch but for graph QL
67:42 - I guess what I need to do then is look
67:46 - at query includes
68:03 - at the very least we can just test it
68:57 - okay cool so harsh it has linked
69:03 - something that will hopefully be useful
69:05 - let's see
70:06 - shoes
70:10 - 3:48
70:24 - okay let's bring this over then and this
70:29 - will be the last thing that we do we
70:33 - actually got farther than I thought that
70:35 - we would I thought it was gonna be a lot
70:37 - harder to get graph QL working with
70:39 - WordPress but that was that was a nice
70:42 - surprise that it was that easy okay
71:01 - okay yeah it's definitely what we're
71:04 - trying to do
72:19 - okay yeah that makes sense
72:22 - it seems like basically one I'm getting
72:26 - two important things out of this one is
72:28 - that the data even if I grab the data
72:33 - when a component loads instead of doing
72:35 - it like we're we're doing a fetch right
72:37 - now the data will still be available in
72:40 - redux under Apollo data in the Redux
72:44 - store but the second thing is since
72:47 - we're going to have a search bar I want
72:49 - to have a live search this is also going
72:54 - to come into play and that how how would
72:57 - we do a how would we fire off a an API
73:02 - call based on a user action so this
73:08 - probably have to do something like this
73:12 - as well
73:12 - okay all right thanks thanks for that
73:17 - link Harshit that does clear things up
73:21 - so probably tomorrow we'll be working on
73:24 - that more okay
73:39 - all right so I think we'll probably just
73:42 - be at will be we'll go into the question
73:47 - and answer now I was thinking about
73:49 - doing another Pomodoro session but at
73:53 - this point I think I just I wanted to
73:58 - read up a little bit more on things I
74:01 - don't think it would be a great stream
74:04 - because I'd be doing a lot of reading
74:06 - and that's not really nice to watch so
74:11 - if you can stick around and for the
74:13 - question answer session and help answer
74:16 - questions that would be awesome
74:17 - otherwise thank you so much for watching
74:20 - and I'll be back tomorrow I might stream
74:23 - a little bit earlier than normal
74:24 - tomorrow so I'll let you all know on on
74:27 - Twitter and I'll schedule the streams
74:29 - you get a notification if you subscribe
74:31 - to the free code camp channel about what
74:34 - time on stream let's see let me go I'm
74:40 - going to go back to the live shot here
74:42 - and try to answer as many questions as I
74:45 - can
75:12 - okay here's some questions here blank
75:16 - says I'm trying to send data from a form
75:23 - to Google sheets and I found an article
75:24 - and medium on how to do that but I don't
75:27 - know how to set up the last script any
75:29 - help would be great yeah that's actually
75:36 - have we have we done that on a stream
75:40 - those are the first frame you know we
75:42 - didn't do that yet okay so I've done
75:44 - that in previous projects but it's
75:46 - before I started streaming so what are
75:49 - you are you using react or just regular
75:55 - Java scripts it doesn't really matter
75:59 - that much it's pretty much the same
76:01 - either way in terms of making the call
76:05 - either with Ajax or with fetch or
76:07 - whatever you're using so Blake if you
76:12 - have the code for that on github or if
76:15 - you can share it somehow share it with
76:18 - me I'll take a look at it and maybe I
76:20 - can also send you how I've done it
76:23 - before maybe that will help
77:00 - and see
77:31 - all right not really a lot of questions
77:33 - a lot of discussions I keep scrolling
77:36 - trying to find a question
77:46 - okay let me
77:54 - would we put that this is it
78:05 - oh here was
78:14 - okay there's no schema all right so I
78:17 - was checking out Evo says if we go to
78:20 - Docs it should say it should talk about
78:23 - what feels lower but it seems like
78:26 - there's there's no nothing available
78:29 - there so anyway I'll have to keep that
78:35 - in mind maybe there's something I need
78:36 - to set up to populate this
78:50 - Rowen said try so i mentioned earlier i
78:54 - couldn't play youtube videos on my
78:56 - browser right now rowan says try
78:58 - clearing the cache just for youtube I
78:59 - tried it it did not work so I think I'll
79:02 - actually need to turn off my browser and
79:07 - turn it back hunt
79:10 - it just sounds silly to say that like
79:13 - that's it's the answers just just
79:17 - restarted it'll work but it'll probably
79:20 - work this did happen before and that was
79:22 - that was the fix
79:33 - rishabh says can we expect something
79:36 - about subscriptions in graph QL I don't
79:41 - know I don't know yet I'm late I said
79:43 - I'm still I'm very very new in learning
79:46 - graph QL like as I'm streaming so I
79:51 - don't know what we can expect with graph
79:53 - QL but any cool stuff that would be
79:56 - helpful for this project I'm definitely
79:58 - open to learning and using on this
80:01 - project oh cool
80:09 - John Hansen says I'd wondered how this
80:10 - would work thanks Jessi for your work
80:12 - through to get this better than any
80:16 - how-to video cool
80:23 - thanks thank you yeah that that's cool
80:28 - I'm glad you said that because sometimes
80:30 - I wonder how helpful these videos are
80:32 - for actually learning things so I
80:36 - appreciate that
80:41 - vacation says by the way I'm a fan a fan
80:44 - not a fan I'm not exactly sure what
80:47 - you're trying to say but I'll just take
80:49 - it as you're a fan of the stream and
80:51 - thank you thanks for watching Kevin says
81:01 - the four benefits of social media
81:03 - marketing number three will blow your
81:05 - mind I don't even remember what that is
81:07 - now I want to know brush my safe
81:20 - I'll actually my wafer at this one and
81:24 - see positive feedback
81:36 - cool yeah I had big plans for my website
81:43 - but then I got clients and I didn't have
81:45 - time and so I just never updated it
81:47 - again so he only ended up with two blog
81:49 - posts and I only wrote one of the two
82:09 - okay so good Nash says I know this is
82:16 - not a place for asking about something
82:17 - like this but wanted to know something
82:19 - about API do you know any way to send
82:22 - commands from an android app with using
82:25 - java to raspberry pi using Python
82:28 - through an API I don't know I mean
82:33 - certainly I don't think is this is the
82:35 - wrong place to ask those questions
82:36 - because we get a lot of different people
82:38 - with different skill sets that are in
82:39 - the live chat so I think any you know
82:42 - any questions fair game because someone
82:45 - might be watching that that is work with
82:47 - that I personally have never worked with
82:50 - with that type of thing
82:52 - so I'm not sure yeah I mean this is
83:02 - definitely avoiding the question and I
83:04 - don't think this will work in your
83:05 - situation but if it was me and I was
83:07 - doing it I would just build the Android
83:09 - app and react native and then I would
83:12 - use JavaScript for the Raspberry Pi we
83:14 - use node and then that way I would know
83:18 - what I was doing a little bit more
83:20 - because he would all be JavaScript but
83:23 - yeah I really don't know so I'm sorry
83:25 - about that
83:26 - so I couldn't help you but but don't
83:29 - feel bad about asking questions like
83:31 - that you know feel free to ask anything
83:43 - see vacation says can't we use rails you
83:50 - can certainly use rails I'm not going to
83:52 - use rails for this project I probably
83:53 - won't be using rails for any of the
83:55 - projects that I'm doing for work but I'm
84:00 - sure a lot of what I'm doing could be
84:02 - integrated with something that that
84:05 - you're making with rails
84:17 - oh cool so REO says guys I found
84:22 - something amazing word expressed aiyo
84:24 - this project aims to replace PHP with
84:27 - JavaScript and WordPress development by
84:28 - using nodejs and Express to consume data
84:31 - from a wordpress database using graph QL
84:34 - it uses Apollo to fetch the data that's
84:37 - really cool I mean that's just a little
84:40 - what we were trying to do that sounds
84:42 - that sounds awesome
84:44 - it fetched all des fêtes the data and
84:46 - deliver it into react components cool
85:12 - okay so I had asked earlier whether or
85:16 - not you all preferred the type of stream
85:18 - like either like we had today where I go
85:22 - into the stream just really clueless
85:23 - about how to do a thing and then we just
85:26 - work through it and learn together and
85:28 - try to see what we can do or the type of
85:31 - stream where I pretty much know what I'm
85:33 - doing I've already done it before and so
85:36 - I just kind of go through and explain
85:38 - what I'm doing but there's not as much
85:40 - guesswork and learning as we go and it
85:44 - looks like some of you definitely like
85:48 - to see me work through things and in
85:51 - troubleshoot and debug so that's awesome
85:54 - it seems like look it seems like harsh
86:00 - just said harsh it said when I do have
86:03 - an idea that I know I get through it get
86:06 - more done yeah that's true so I think
86:08 - probably what I'll end up doing is still
86:10 - having having a mix Kevin says I like
86:13 - both
86:16 - let's see Zubair says this is super fine
86:19 - your streams are better your mistakes
86:21 - make us perfect cool that was that was
86:24 - the whole point right if I make the
86:26 - mistake and you see me do it then you
86:29 - won't have to make the mistake and learn
86:31 - from it because you've already seen me
86:33 - do it uh-huh so all right cool so it
86:36 - seems like you all would like to mix so
86:39 - I'll try to keep in mind and have a mix
86:41 - I made it a lot of what I do on the
86:43 - stream just depends on what I have to do
86:44 - for work anyway so I only have just a
86:47 - certain like range of options to choose
86:49 - from each day to do a stream line but
86:52 - I'll try to keep a nice mix and and do
86:57 - both so we'll be kind of adventurous
86:59 - sometimes in the streams and try new
87:02 - things like today and then other times
87:05 - there's gonna I mean you all know when
87:07 - you're building something there's some
87:08 - times when you just have to do a thing
87:10 - that you've done a hundred times before
87:12 - but it has to be done so we'll still
87:15 - have some things like that for every
87:17 - stream you know like setting up for
87:20 - every project I mean setting up the
87:21 - server right you gotta set up a server
87:24 - for every
87:25 - so that's that's you know not really a
87:27 - big thing setting up your dev
87:29 - environment just like basic CSS layout
87:33 - you know we'll do that as well
87:44 - Harshit says enjoying the live reloading
87:47 - and and rock cool I'm glad I'm glad you
87:50 - enjoy it didn't really do that much with
87:53 - it but it'll be really cool once we
87:55 - start putting in UI elements and being
87:58 - able to instantly see that feedback and
88:00 - inspect it and dev tools see what's
88:02 - happening with the store I think it
88:04 - would be really really cool and just I
88:09 - know I said this before but it was a
88:10 - long time ago I definitely want to give
88:12 - a shout out to the people at n Grove
88:15 - I can't remember the guys name but the
88:18 - guy who I guess made and rock he's he's
88:23 - letting us use it
88:24 - unlimited for free so normally to be
88:28 - able to have this many users on and rock
88:31 - at once it would it would cost money but
88:34 - we're able to do it for free so he's
88:36 - doing that for free code camp for these
88:38 - streams so I really appreciate that
88:47 - vacation s what are you making
88:50 - Harshit did say a bulletin for the
88:52 - university yes so basically it's just
88:55 - gonna pull in posts from WordPress and
88:57 - then display those posts and it's gonna
89:02 - have like infinite scroll for the posts
89:05 - and you can you'll be able to sort the
89:07 - post by date caddy a filter by category
89:11 - so you'll be able to submit your own
89:14 - posts now they won't automatically be
89:17 - there they'll go to somebody to review
89:18 - first before they get put in to the
89:21 - bulletin so that's I mean that's pretty
89:24 - much it just display images YouTube
89:28 - embeds and text and then allow users to
89:32 - submit a form so it's not gonna be
89:34 - really complicated now I will tell you
89:37 - this if we have time I would love to
89:41 - maybe add in some extra features so
89:44 - users have to sign in so we you know
89:49 - they'll have an account right so based
89:51 - on that account we could save user
89:53 - preferences so we could say preferences
89:55 - for how they like the UI to look
89:58 - we have several different options for
90:01 - the UI so we could save their
90:03 - preferences we could save preferences
90:04 - for I don't know what categories they
90:07 - want to see at the top of the page maybe
90:10 - give them the ability to star certain
90:12 - announcements or bookmark them so that
90:15 - they can see things it would be may be
90:18 - cool to have desktop notifications when
90:21 - new things are available so there's a
90:23 - lot of extra stuff that I've thought
90:25 - about doing and I haven't done yet so
90:27 - this could be a lot more complex it just
90:30 - kind of depends on what other projects I
90:33 - have going on and how you know what the
90:36 - deadlines are like you know if there's
90:38 - anything really high priority I'll have
90:39 - to do that instead so I can't guarantee
90:44 - that we'll do stuff like that but I
90:45 - would really like to do some stuff like
90:47 - that if possible
91:00 - see
91:10 - Brett says I learned graph QL while
91:13 - giving my daughter a bath and getting
91:15 - her fed amazing it is pretty amazing
91:20 - cool
91:24 - actually I forgot today is my dog my
91:27 - youngest daughter's birthday she turned
91:29 - one today so I'm really excited about
91:33 - that she's my youngest and she's so cute
91:35 - and she's also my last because my wife
91:39 - can't have kids anymore so I just
91:41 - spoiler because it's my last little baby
91:44 - so I can't believe she's already one but
91:50 - yeah actually I want to make sure I get
91:52 - out of here somewhat soon so that I can
91:55 - go home and hang out with her
92:07 - maxime a says who used graph QL and
92:10 - meteor has anybody use graph QL a meteor
92:14 - I'm actually I'm really interested in
92:16 - meteor I've seen some cool demos of
92:17 - things people have done with it and I
92:20 - know it's been around for a while is it
92:23 - still relevant is it worth it to learn
92:25 - it or is there something newer that
92:27 - people are moving to if it's still
92:31 - relevant then I definitely interested in
92:34 - learning how to use it and doing a
92:36 - project with it okay cool so Harshit
92:43 - says I can I can get rid of the actions
92:46 - that I'm using now in this app so like
92:50 - right now we're dispatching actions to
92:52 - get our data I can get rid of that and
92:55 - instead use graph QL queries to
92:58 - basically accomplish the same thing
92:59 - that's cool that should simplify our
93:02 - code quite a bit Bret said so would we
93:10 - eliminate Redux actually that's a good
93:12 - question should we eliminate Redux or do
93:15 - we still want to use them together I
93:17 - mean I definitely still would love to
93:18 - have data in the store to be available
93:22 - but yeah I don't know if anybody has any
93:26 - opinions on that please let me know
93:57 - see
94:04 - John Henson says while I'd love to ask a
94:07 - question about adding event listeners
94:09 - when components are there and then not
94:11 - then there again think I've got it but
94:14 - whoa oh yeah cool let let me know how
94:19 - that goes and if you need help with that
94:25 - I get yes so if you're using it in
94:29 - reacts with event listeners I mean
94:33 - normally when I have like things that I
94:36 - would normally use jQuery for within
94:38 - event listeners with when I'm doing it
94:40 - with react I just make sure the state
94:44 - changes when an action happens and then
94:47 - the components will you know we rendered
94:50 - everything will be taken care of so you
94:54 - know you like you could just put like an
94:56 - on-click attribute onto the component or
95:00 - the button or you know whatever has to
95:02 - happen or I don't know what they I don't
95:06 - remember what they all or but for a lot
95:08 - of the events that you would normally
95:11 - use like that you would want to do
95:15 - usually you can just add it as an
95:17 - attribute and then change the state
95:21 - based on when that happened
95:40 - okay Harshit says is Redux compulsory
95:43 - for this project actually no not really
95:48 - well to be honest with you I didn't
95:50 - expect to use graph QL until today I
95:52 - decided today we're gonna use it so at
95:55 - first I thought we were just going to do
95:57 - Redux with the WordPress REST API which
96:01 - is what we were doing yesterday so I
96:05 - like I'm open to reevaluating whether or
96:08 - not we should even use Redux on this
96:10 - project now that we're using graph QL so
96:14 - maybe I'll have to do some research on
96:16 - that and think about that maybe we don't
96:20 - need it I mean there's definitely some
96:21 - other pieces of data parts of the state
96:26 - that we won't make API calls to get but
96:30 - it would still be nice if it was
96:31 - available in the store so we'll see
96:37 - we'll see how that goes
96:40 - but if we don't need to keep it we can
96:42 - simplify things then I guess you know
96:44 - maybe it's not
96:45 - there's no not really good reason to use
96:48 - Redux
97:01 - okay so Blake I just saw your your link
97:05 - so I'm putting that in my address bar on
97:10 - my other screen right now
97:28 - okay so off to take a look at that maybe
97:31 - after the stream maybe tomorrow because
97:33 - I do want to leave shortly after the
97:35 - stream ends so but I'll leave that up on
97:37 - my screen so I don't forget coder Jim
97:45 - says I learned a lot for your videos the
97:47 - problem is only that I don't have enough
97:50 - time to keep up to date with you yeah
97:53 - yeah I sometimes I wonder about that too
97:56 - like I just put out a lot of content
97:59 - since we're streaming I mean we do at
98:02 - least an hour every day usually closer
98:04 - to two hours you know five days a week
98:07 - not always five days a week but that's
98:10 - that's what I shoot for I know that's a
98:12 - lot so I don't know it just takes a lot
98:17 - of my idea is that maybe I would
98:20 - categorize the content better have
98:22 - better descriptions and you know like
98:25 - timestamps of when I go over certain
98:27 - topics to help you all to be able to
98:29 - sift through the material and skip what
98:32 - you don't need it's just there's so much
98:36 - of it I just don't have time to do all
98:38 - that yet but I mean I definitely
98:41 - understand it's a lot to work through so
98:43 - for those of you who are doing it and
98:45 - keeping up with it that's awesome um but
98:50 - but anyway thanks for watching you know
98:52 - even if you can't watch everything I
98:53 - appreciate even you know whatever you
98:56 - all can watch that's I mean that's
98:58 - awesome
98:59 - I should says going to sleep now it's
99:03 - 1:00 a.m. all right good night thanks
99:06 - for watching okay thanks everyone for
99:11 - saying happy birthday oh my daughter's
99:16 - name is Cordelia so we named her
99:18 - Cordelia Elizabeth and in yes she's one
99:22 - today
99:38 - okay cool so yeah so Blake says every I
99:42 - see
99:48 - all right cool Blake I will check that
99:50 - out like I said either today or tomorrow
99:53 - and figure out how to get that google
99:56 - that link to the Google sheet working
100:03 - okay Brett says react definitely
100:06 - overshadowed media okay all right
100:11 - Harshit says we'll make a pool with auth
100:15 - system you need regular email and
100:18 - password as the method actually maybe
100:22 - did I miss something
100:34 - okay so maybe I missed it seems like all
100:40 - harsh it's probably asleep right now so
100:42 - if you're still awake and you're
100:45 - watching you can hear this
100:46 - I guess that's cool with the pool
100:48 - request I'm not exactly sure what what
100:51 - is what you mean about the regular email
100:54 - and password so anyway send me a message
100:59 - on Twitter or something let me know
101:01 - oh okay in my plant yeah so for the
101:06 - login right now it's a it's a password
101:09 - this login system so a user goes to the
101:13 - bulletin and they're prompted to put
101:15 - their email in and it has to be a email
101:18 - that ends with at Franciscan edu if it
101:22 - is that kind of email then the system
101:24 - right now it's using auth0 which handles
101:28 - you know keeping track all the users and
101:31 - everything but they get out their email
101:35 - a link they click the link it logs them
101:37 - in and it stores their login credentials
101:40 - in local storage and they stay logged in
101:42 - on that browser for about a year unless
101:44 - they clear their local storage so that's
101:47 - the current system so if we go with a
101:50 - you know a new system I still would like
101:53 - to keep it so that users with the
101:56 - Franciscan email address could still do
101:59 - the password this login thing I think
102:03 - that's best
102:04 - that way users don't have to worry about
102:06 - passwords I don't have to worry about
102:07 - passwords then at some point down the
102:10 - road I would love to tie it into our
102:12 - single sign-on system here at the
102:14 - University which isn't they haven't
102:16 - launched it yet so that's why I'm not
102:19 - trying to tie it in right away because I
102:21 - it's not ready but I'll need some some
102:26 - information some more information about
102:28 - how to tie that in I'm not even sure how
102:30 - they're they're implementing it it's a
102:31 - totally different Department is handling
102:33 - it
102:33 - so so we'll see how that goes
102:38 - but that's basically what I would like
102:41 - is as a password list system sending
102:44 - email links
102:49 - all right so I've gotten to the bottom
102:51 - of the live chat hopefully I didn't miss
102:53 - anyone's questions I will be back
102:56 - tomorrow
102:57 - like I said tomorrow maybe around like
102:59 - 1:30 1 or 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time
103:03 - it's a little bit earlier than normal
103:06 - but thank you all for watching and for
103:10 - helping me get through kind of a
103:13 - challenging stream because it was all
103:15 - new you know new techniques new
103:18 - technologies that I haven't used before
103:20 - so anyway thanks again for watching and
103:25 - for contributing in the live chat I will
103:28 - be back someone else on my Twitter was
103:31 - it's in the description for the video
103:33 - it's it's at Jesse or Weibull but you
103:37 - know it's in the description too she's
103:38 - wanted to link ok so anyway yeah thanks
103:45 - and I'll be back tomorrow and until then
103:48 - have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie and let me know if you can see the the video and everything all right if I'm actually moving because something's wrong with my preview and it's frozen so I don't know if it's just me or if it's happening for everybody so I'm just gonna wait a few seconds just to get confirmation as to whether or not my video okay cool video must be cool I figured it was me cuz I can't play any YouTube videos right now on my computer I probably just need to restart my browser that's happened before not frequently but it has happened let's see so today I've decided to be really ambitious and I'm gonna try to set up graph QL to work with WordPress and I've never done that before I've never worked with graph QL at all before so but I know I want to learn how to do it so we're gonna we're gonna try it out I've done a little bit of research about this earlier today but most of my time has been taken up working on the catechetical Institute website that was project one that we did just minor updates though and some just some basic things so I figured that wasn't really worth putting on a stream alright I got a lot of people in the live chat so I'm gonna say hi before we start coding hey everybody okay cowboy says there might be audio interference okay let me know okay Evo actually has a graph QL API prototype so yeah definitely I'd love to have that link so send it I mean you can't really post links in the live chat but you can direct message me on Twitter or whatever social media you're on that you want to message me on that's cool let's see alright let's get started a couple of like a couple of things Oh for the last two streams I've forgot to thank some people who have submitted pool requests this past week so I'm just gonna do it right now so I don't forget because I'm pretty sure I will forget again if I try to put it off so I'm pretty sure I have those up here yeah okay cool so I'm not gonna spend a lot of time going over those you definitely can check them out yourself and this isn't a private repo so this is the Resource Center project too so we have okay we had to for some reason I thought we had more pool requests but we have to let me refresh just to be sure I'm not missing one all right there we go we have three that's what I thought okay so Matt did some fix some warnings we'll just click into it briefly so obviously you can read this if you want and check out what's changed but I had when I had implemented Google Analytics I had a lot of repetitive the Annette function for Google Analytics was just I put it how to put in every component so the way I did it was not the best way in terms of you know trying not to repeat myself a lot so Matt clean that up which is awesome so also found a spot where I had basically had two functions doing the exact same thing right next to each other didn't even realize it so he cleaned that up for me as well and then Sebastian had to pull requests so there was some stuff going on with our forms and just some warnings and things that got cleaned up and also he noted some some UI things in Firefox which I didn't I I did very minimal testing in Firefox I I can't even remember how much testing I didn't Firefox it's it's entirely possible that I just didn't test it at all so anyway they found some stuff in Firefox and fix that so really nice little bit of CSS cleanup and finally this is some really cool stuff so on Android added in some information basically to to let Android know how to display it how to display the app so I wonder it's going to be hard to see this so I'm gonna try it out anyway let me see the screen so up in actually let me let me make this but you trying to make this bigger for a minute you see if I can there we go alright so right here we have our icon for the Resource Center and I'm gonna throw this into airplane mode so it's an airplane mode right now I don't know if you can see the airplane but I'm gonna click it we get this screen I have the glares kind of rough on here so I don't know if you'll be able to see it let me go to a darker screen maybe to cut the glare but anyway big lit yeah there's really bad but this is the resource center it works like right now I clicked on the logos page and we're completely offline which is awesome so I don't know that anybody here at the University will ever even try that out because I mean we have any people at the university that still want us to like mail them things like on paper and have no interest in using the Internet at all or computers so I don't know how many people who appreciate that but I definitely appreciate it also if you go they're in Chrome the bar at the top now is the Franciscan green color so anyway that was just that was really cool I am I checked that I was showing people I showed I should the guy that works in the office next to me and I went home and showed my wife and because I was I was super excited about it so all right so anyway thank you Matt thanks Sebastian those were awesome pool requests I appreciate that and now now we're gonna get started with with some graph QL so let me go let's see we're gonna start with this I'm gonna go over to where we have our code for this project but we're probably not gonna put that much yeah we're probably you're not gonna do that much with with this code today what we're gonna be doing is you know trying to set up our WordPress to work with graph QL let's let me get my Pomodoro clock going so I'm gonna do 25 minutes of coding and then after that I'll take a fiveminute break I'll go over the questions in the live chat then we'll do another 25minute session and we'll do at least two 25minute sessions after that we'll see how it's going maybe we do some more coding or maybe we'll just do a question and an answer but at least probably get in about an hour and our code okay all right so what I'm from what I've looked up so far and if anybody has experience with this put it in the live chat I'll try to keep an eye on the live chat to see if anybody's putting in some advice for that but from what I've seen so far a few other people have worked on this so we may not have to do this from scratch it's entirely possible that we could just pull something from github that'll get us started so oops I didn't even start my time all right so I'm gonna pull over some of the projects on github that I've been looking at I'll pull it over under this screen just so you all can see what I'm thinking about using so these are our two really different approaches and they're not let's see so this one is act actually actively maintained this one not so much but I know that it's probably hard to see everything the way I have these windows up but I'll just kind of briefly describe what what's going on with these this is more like configuring like an entire separate server to to run graph QL and then it's going to pull data directly from the my sequel database using I believe they're using sequel eyes to help with that okay so this one seems like it's a little bit more involved this project seems to be more like a wordpress plugin I haven't had time to read through all of it but that's the impression that I got from a little bit that I did read so it seems like of the two the one on the left here this what's it called WP graph QL would probably be the one that's that's a bit more simple to work with so I don't know let's let me give everyone just a minute or so I want to know what you all think if any of you have used either of these before if you have any any advice for me or if there's something else out there that I'm not aware of that I should check out so we'll give it a minute depending on on what said in the live chat I may go with something else but otherwise I think I'll probably try this one out first because it's more up to date and it seems seems like it'll be the quicker of the two so while I'm waiting for the delay and the responses I'm just going to explain briefly why I want to go with graph QL and WordPress so for this project in particular we already have a lot of data in WordPress that I want to bring in so that's why I'm doing WordPress I don't want to migrate any of that data the people that are in charge of putting that data in are already trained on how to do it in WordPress so I don't want to mess up their workflow having said that we've worked with the WordPress API in the past and it definitely works it works well but graph QL because it will enable us to in one API call hit all the end points that we need get all the data that we need and only the data that we need I think it would be a lot more efficient to do it that way so that's why I want to switch to graph QL the other reason is as I mentioned you know right away in the stream I really want to learn how to work with it on how to use it I've talked before about all these smaller projects contributing to the larger project which is redesigning the main university website and one of the things that I do would like to use for that website is graph QL because I don't want to have to have a lot of different API calls happening for every single page so this is gonna you know work up to that so do we absolutely need graph queue up for this project no we don't but if I don't have it then this project would basically be pretty much the same as what we had done for for project one so I'd hate to just have a repeat of that we would have a few different things but I think this would be better you know be better for me for learning and then you know better for you all I think just to have some exposure to graph QL if you don't already all right so enough time has gone by that I'm the delay is is dealt with now so I'm gonna check the live chat and then we'll be started okay okay so Arielle says it seems like the one on the left is mostly PHP and the one on the right is JavaScript yeah that was the impression that I got I'm I'm a little bit nervous about that so this one is mostly PHP and for this we're getting yeah JavaScript I'm a little nervous about that because I'm definitely better at JavaScript that I am with with PHP so here's what we'll do I'm gonna scroll through just the basic setup options and if a lot of it is confusing to me then we'll just move on and maybe go with this because well I think this one will be faster to set up if it's all in PHP and things that I don't understand it probably and it won't be faster just because of my inexperience with it all right so let's let's scroll a bit let's see was this did you see any setup instructions there am I missing something because I didn't I didn't see anything what okay that was it download and install like any WordPress plugin off alright well that's that's super easy okay well that's worth the try if we just have to install it like any WordPress plugin then I'm I'm fine with that that's that's easy so I think it's worth a shot to just install this plugin and see what it's like if it doesn't work for what we're trying to do we can go with something else but otherwise this is probably going to save a lot of time and I'm just going to move this over the other stream but I want to keep this ready in case that this other one doesn't work out okay so we're I'm I'm guessing the entire thing then it's gets installed all right I will need a zip file for this so let's download the zip and then let's log in to log into the same the same WordPress install that we're using for the content right now that we worked with yesterday and that is just my might say we're gonna use Jessie waggle calm and I'm not really actively updating this site anymore or using it for anything so if this messes it up I'm I'm not really worried about it that'll just be incentive for me to actually update it okay I guess I'll I'll pull this over so you all can see if you've never updated let's make it bigger updated a plugin so there are different ways you can add a plugin to WordPress so one of the ways is through the admin panel here you could also just access the files directly and then just drop your file into the plugins folder so for right now I think this will be the quickest way to do it where my plugins we're going to add a new plugin and yeah it's update all right now I don't want update this right now in case it messes up no weird all right so we're gonna upload a plugin so we needed an zip format so that's why we I did the zip earlier and where we get downloads okay see how this goes cool let's activate the plugin and words to that cool so we have our graph QL API set up I was looking to see if I have any extra options here it doesn't look like it so so I guess there's no configuration screen or anything okay now let's see about getting some data just to make sure it's working I don't want to have to download a graph QL desktop thing right now there's got to be a website I can use does anybody know of a website I can go to quickly to test out graph QL okay let's see okay which is gonna be your side day long / graphic you though okay okay and I'm still trying to find a way to test this here we go I think I found a browser client okay sorry I wasn't checking out the the live chat I'm gonna test out some of the the things you all mentioned the la chat okay all right so I'm not I'm not getting anything to work right now I guess I could just go ahead and do this because uh oh okay I can just install this with homebrew so let's do that cuz that's gonna be easy or the Chrome extension yeah the Chrome extension might be easier all right set em points let's see if it works uhuh I don't think it did alright so I don't think we're getting what we're supposed to be getting so yeah the endpoint is supposed to be such graphic oh all right yeah so we so we have dogs all right let's check out the ducks and okay all right we need to flush the permalinks would have been nice if they put that on the on the github repo read me all right it's the settings performance those fees paid okay all right so let's do that settings permalinks all right I think if I just flip it flip the settings that should work all right let's shut again yep well it's we had a different error alright let's see I need and see all right so here's what I have now so I need to put in a query basically which next step I guess is figure out how to do a query with graph QL so let's see I don't want to watch I don't want to watch a video there's no text that goes along with it all right okay so we can we can't add things with this that's good Lefty's PHP okay okay I see Kevin says the fonts pretty small so I'll I'll make sure a zoom in on things we're doing it all right this looks nice real basics it's what query okay all right a few more minutes then we'll do the question/answer let's see I'm not sure what this data is is looking is gonna look like so maybe what was this one again let's just copy something see what happens I guess we don't need it we'll paste that in see what happens now they let's check the post I need I really need to know what the with date I'm dealing with I guess I will need to check this video today once you graduate you can point it at your size calculate and planning for us documentation to started I'm just gonna watch enough of this to get I don't know YouTube videos but I said earlier YouTube videos aren't playing alright but actually this this should be enough create those alright let's just create those all right cool let's try that see if this oops see if this works must have a sub selection all right so chef selection those edges all right let me move this over so I can type it out all right so we're gonna try to get some posts here not data date all right awesome okay so here's what we put in here basically we're asking for posts as far as edges a node are concerned I have no idea what that's talking about right now it's just in the demo video that's what they typed in but then down here I've just specified which which items I wanted so which pieces of data about the posts I wanted so we should just get back these ones so let's see we did get back all right so within posts edges I guess we're we're getting all these nodes right so we did we just got ID date title and slug great and then to compare we had a legacy side by side what we get from the rest API and then we get from graph QL so let me find you find where we had this pretty sure I had it on this screen yep here it is okay so let me try to do my best to get these sidebyside and my my timer ran out so we're gonna take our fiveminute break as soon as we just seen this side by side so this is the same data for the most part between graph QL on the left and the rest API on the right you can see by default the rest API gives us everything right so each one of these posts has all of this data that was just one post over here the same post is this right so by default they're basically there is no default it's whatever we whatever we ask for so we've been able to get exactly what we want based on a query like this so you can see a lot less data now but previous project we have found ways to cut down on this data but whenever we try to limit our API calls then we couldn't filter out our data like we wanted so there wasn't a good way to both use only one API call per page and limit the data we're getting for each API call so that was our that was the dilemma that we faced in project 2 and we ended up going with using one API call even though we were pulling in more data than we needed to so with graph QL we shouldn't have to make that decision we should be able to do both use one API call and at the same time get only the data that we need all right so let me start my five minutes himer we're going to do question answers for five minutes and then we'll go back to another 25 minutes of coding at this point it's really I mean we have a graph QL API up and running so we're going to move back to our react project and try to pull that data in and we want to get that into our Redux store so let me find the live chats and I'm gonna scroll up and let's see so I'm getting distracted there's a lot of messages coming over my slack at work I don't think any of them are super important for me I just want a glance just to make sure okay I'm like I'm the only person that really has access and knows about some of our sites that are kind of important so that's why I still I glanced at that because if an emergency happened I I would probably be the only person that could fix it all so here's a fun fact I learned on slack orb right before the stream started that the person who works in the office right next to me used to hang out with a member of the wutang clan so he's now the coolest person I know I don't know if we have any wutang fans in here but I thought that was kind of cool okay all right I'm trying to find the questions there's a it's quite a bit in the live chat today okay so we had a question about did you fix the slack link I can't find in the description all right I'm glad you brought that up because I completely forgot about it I remove the slack length from the description because basically it didn't work so from I have no idea where that original link came from it says that that links expired and we need to get a new link but I don't know how to get that link from slack so if anybody is more familiar with slack or whoever got that original link if you're watching right now let me know how I can get another link if that's even possible the other alternative I guess would be manually sending out invites so I would just I guess I could say anybody that wants in slack channel let me know and then I can just send you an invite based on your email address so you just have to give me your email address through whatever you know channel you want to give that to me and I can invite you I mean that method will work for sure but it would definitely be more convenient for everyone if if we could get the link working so so that's where the the slack link situation is at right now okay also I didn't start our our serve our end grukk server I'm gonna do that right now so since we're gonna be working with this with the react app now you all can go in there let me post it post the URL okay so that's personal live chat now so if you want to go there we haven't done anything with it yet but we will be working with it soon so you want to go there you can check it out not much there at this point okay it looks like some of you were talking about the progressive web app to the last project that I demoed at the beginning on my phone there the Resource Center yeah so create react app comes with a serviceworker and and that's basically what allows it to operate like that a progressive web app so so you would want of your app to have some functionality even offline and then as you get a better connection it progressively has more capabilities so for instance obviously offline you can't submit the form but if you're offline you could still read all the content so you have this core functionality in your app that always works in your web page that will work no matter what so that's the idea of a progressive web app although I was thinking I'm probably not gonna do it right now but it's possible that we could get the form data and save the form data until we did have an internet connection and then send it at that point so I've seen similar things done before like I said I don't I don't know that anybody is going to be using it like that and using it offline so I don't know that it's it's a good use of my time here at work but it would be kind of a cool thing to do on the side just to get it working so we would we would need to store that data may be in local storage I don't know we somehow we'd store that data and then just try to detect whenever we got a network connection and and then send it at that point okay Rowland said try Visor you can mirror your phone on your desktop I actually do a visor installed I just I act I hadn't even planned on showing that so I didn't have it have it ready but I'll remember next time if I'm planning on doing something with on my phone I'll have a better set up Marco says so create react app automatically makes the basic progressive web app yeah pretty much yeah so you so by default create react app is his progressive web app depending on how you build it I'm sure you can make it better or worse at being a progressive web app but the Resource Center is actually not bad like I said the forms obviously don't work it seems like some of the the images and everything we're still on there so that that was pretty cool that that worked well excuse me yawning so yeah some of the images worked I think it just depended on what actually got loaded before I put it on airplane mode so I was able to load the logos but I didn't get some of the images from the other pages okay all right so my five minutes is up I don't know how long it's been up for I just checked so I'm still not getting the beeping in my headphones when that's up so I don't I don't know what the problem is I probably just need to restart my my browser it's been quite a while since I've done that so let me mark down where I left off at and the latch okay all right so another 25minute session and then after that we'll we'll see if we're gonna code more and I forgot that I had covered this up again so let me move that up there we go I had just assumed you all could see the timer keep forgetting that my my face is in that corner okay let's move this out of the way well I guess we have we have this here so we'll we'll keep this here now here's what we need to do so we need some way to bring in this graph QL data so from what I understand a lot of people use something called Apollo to make it easier to work with data let me know if if Apollo is suitable for this if you know of something better otherwise I'm going to try to install Apollo now and and get that working okay so harsh it says react Apollo and relay so do I use relay with Apollo or is it I could use either relay or Apollo I have reacts Apollo up on github right now hmm okay so it's either relay or Apollo the Helio thinks Apollo is the easiest to start working with okay all right cool let's start with Apollo is anybody at experience using Apollo with redux it should I even be worried about that or should I use something else okay so Helio does have experience with using Apollo and redux okay cool all right so let's install Apollo let me find my my terminal where am I there we go okay so I just had to get up they jump and what I do it alright so we're gonna do yarn add Apollo or reactive part Apollo sorry should I'd like to I'm interested in seeing what you all think do you like it better when we do streams like this where I'm completely clueless and we work our way through it together or do you like it better when I have it a better idea of what I'm doing and it's more like me getting everything done and just kind of narrating what I'm doing it doesn't have to be either/or we can always have a mix of the different types of of streams but if it's like overwhelming that you all like or don't like one or the other then I'll keep that in mind okay cool so we have this and let's let's see I'll bring this over here so this is what I'm looking at right now so it looks like we need to wrap our root component in this Apollo okay all right great let's see pretty direct component this component works almost the same as provider community react reacts affects you that's a store property new Apollo provider and also service provider for react redux okay great so it looks like we can replace our provider component with Apollo provider and it should work fine with with what we have set with Redux anyway cool so I'm going to move this over to the other screen and let's let's hook this up just go into our app and well first things first let's import what we need to import is where we get you if it's import follow Apolo client back to Paula and then if you want to follow along with these instructions I'm just on the react Apolo github repository okay alright so we've made a new Apollo client and now let's give it some instructions here network interface okay so here's what we'll put in the the route to our graph QL code you know our demo that we just set up okay so obviously if you're doing this on your project you you'd want to put in whatever whatever yours is or if I mean if you want to use mine as an example just to get started I don't I don't know the care you can do that as well okay great now let's hook this in to our provider so our provider is now going to be our Apollo provider and we need to add in client that we just made up there I entered passing the client and then since we're gonna pass in store as well based on the documentation it seems like that that will still work with what we're trying to do with redux so let me save that and all right well first thing let's just make sure we don't have any errors when we do have errors polar provider is not defined did we forget to do this I guess we probably forgot to import it yep we did forget to import it create a network interface is not to find out it I hope I forgot to import that too I don't know what I was thinking it's it's right there in the in the documentation I just I just didn't see it okay cool so obviously we're not seeing any difference but we're not getting any air is so now we can move on ahead to the next step okay all right so let me bring this back over for just for a minute so we can at this point pull in or it's like we can connect graph QL into our components but I don't think that's what we want to do I'm thinking that instead hmm sorry instead we would want the data to go into our store and then to go into our components from the store so I guess that's that's what we need to figure out how to do so let me bring up the the complete reference I'm just scanning really quickly just to see if this okay so here's everything let's see if they have anything specifically on Redux integrating with Redux awesome okay so we've already connected the store which yep connect the store and area this is what what we need this is really small so let me zoom in okay so so we're gonna keep we're gonna use connects though let's see how they how they say to do this okay I guess we could try putting some of this in our in our component now I'm not a hundred percent sure this is what I was thinking that we would do but let's at least give it a shot just to confirm that we've hooked everything up properly see if we can get some data to display so I wish I could see what the actions were production graph QL all right this is not using Apollo let me close this out I think I want another example so let's go that's for you all right actually they it looks like they were placing Redux with Apollo that's not what we want to do yeah I don't want to do that mmm this might not be uptodate okay this is actually more it looks like it's it's more like what I want to do okay I wasn't super helpful but better idea okay let me check the time all right eight minutes let's see if we can get something to display in eight minutes all right let me move this off the side so I can reference it let's go back here to our home component and let's bring in I'm gonna do some copy and pasting just to save time instead of typing it out bring in graph QL and hmm alright I'm a little bit I'm not confident that I can get something to display in probably what is it six minutes now okay so let's at least just think this out maybe personal comments and so we can start from the same point tomorrow I I know that were the example that I saw in the documentation had an important graph QL here but realistically I was thinking more along the lines of I guess having graph QL in here really I'm sorry not in where am I looking more like in something like this so that when we dispatch an action then instead of making the API call to the REST API it would grab the data from from the graph QL API which would then get stored in the redux store now it seems like that's not really how Apollo works if that's the case then I think I need to do some tutorials on Apollo just to get an idea of how that works and see and see how we should be using it if for anybody that has worked with Apollo if I'm mistaking if I'm mistaken here please let me know but I was I was kind of assuming that basically Apollo would just let me do the same thing that I'm doing here with fetch but for graph QL I guess what I need to do then is look at query includes at the very least we can just test it okay cool so harsh it has linked something that will hopefully be useful let's see shoes 348 okay let's bring this over then and this will be the last thing that we do we actually got farther than I thought that we would I thought it was gonna be a lot harder to get graph QL working with WordPress but that was that was a nice surprise that it was that easy okay okay yeah it's definitely what we're trying to do okay yeah that makes sense it seems like basically one I'm getting two important things out of this one is that the data even if I grab the data when a component loads instead of doing it like we're we're doing a fetch right now the data will still be available in redux under Apollo data in the Redux store but the second thing is since we're going to have a search bar I want to have a live search this is also going to come into play and that how how would we do a how would we fire off a an API call based on a user action so this probably have to do something like this as well okay all right thanks thanks for that link Harshit that does clear things up so probably tomorrow we'll be working on that more okay all right so I think we'll probably just be at will be we'll go into the question and answer now I was thinking about doing another Pomodoro session but at this point I think I just I wanted to read up a little bit more on things I don't think it would be a great stream because I'd be doing a lot of reading and that's not really nice to watch so if you can stick around and for the question answer session and help answer questions that would be awesome otherwise thank you so much for watching and I'll be back tomorrow I might stream a little bit earlier than normal tomorrow so I'll let you all know on on Twitter and I'll schedule the streams you get a notification if you subscribe to the free code camp channel about what time on stream let's see let me go I'm going to go back to the live shot here and try to answer as many questions as I can okay here's some questions here blank says I'm trying to send data from a form to Google sheets and I found an article and medium on how to do that but I don't know how to set up the last script any help would be great yeah that's actually have we have we done that on a stream those are the first frame you know we didn't do that yet okay so I've done that in previous projects but it's before I started streaming so what are you are you using react or just regular Java scripts it doesn't really matter that much it's pretty much the same either way in terms of making the call either with Ajax or with fetch or whatever you're using so Blake if you have the code for that on github or if you can share it somehow share it with me I'll take a look at it and maybe I can also send you how I've done it before maybe that will help and see all right not really a lot of questions a lot of discussions I keep scrolling trying to find a question okay let me would we put that this is it oh here was okay there's no schema all right so I was checking out Evo says if we go to Docs it should say it should talk about what feels lower but it seems like there's there's no nothing available there so anyway I'll have to keep that in mind maybe there's something I need to set up to populate this Rowen said try so i mentioned earlier i couldn't play youtube videos on my browser right now rowan says try clearing the cache just for youtube I tried it it did not work so I think I'll actually need to turn off my browser and turn it back hunt it just sounds silly to say that like that's it's the answers just just restarted it'll work but it'll probably work this did happen before and that was that was the fix rishabh says can we expect something about subscriptions in graph QL I don't know I don't know yet I'm late I said I'm still I'm very very new in learning graph QL like as I'm streaming so I don't know what we can expect with graph QL but any cool stuff that would be helpful for this project I'm definitely open to learning and using on this project oh cool John Hansen says I'd wondered how this would work thanks Jessi for your work through to get this better than any howto video cool thanks thank you yeah that that's cool I'm glad you said that because sometimes I wonder how helpful these videos are for actually learning things so I appreciate that vacation says by the way I'm a fan a fan not a fan I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to say but I'll just take it as you're a fan of the stream and thank you thanks for watching Kevin says the four benefits of social media marketing number three will blow your mind I don't even remember what that is now I want to know brush my safe I'll actually my wafer at this one and see positive feedback cool yeah I had big plans for my website but then I got clients and I didn't have time and so I just never updated it again so he only ended up with two blog posts and I only wrote one of the two okay so good Nash says I know this is not a place for asking about something like this but wanted to know something about API do you know any way to send commands from an android app with using java to raspberry pi using Python through an API I don't know I mean certainly I don't think is this is the wrong place to ask those questions because we get a lot of different people with different skill sets that are in the live chat so I think any you know any questions fair game because someone might be watching that that is work with that I personally have never worked with with that type of thing so I'm not sure yeah I mean this is definitely avoiding the question and I don't think this will work in your situation but if it was me and I was doing it I would just build the Android app and react native and then I would use JavaScript for the Raspberry Pi we use node and then that way I would know what I was doing a little bit more because he would all be JavaScript but yeah I really don't know so I'm sorry about that so I couldn't help you but but don't feel bad about asking questions like that you know feel free to ask anything see vacation says can't we use rails you can certainly use rails I'm not going to use rails for this project I probably won't be using rails for any of the projects that I'm doing for work but I'm sure a lot of what I'm doing could be integrated with something that that you're making with rails oh cool so REO says guys I found something amazing word expressed aiyo this project aims to replace PHP with JavaScript and WordPress development by using nodejs and Express to consume data from a wordpress database using graph QL it uses Apollo to fetch the data that's really cool I mean that's just a little what we were trying to do that sounds that sounds awesome it fetched all des fêtes the data and deliver it into react components cool okay so I had asked earlier whether or not you all preferred the type of stream like either like we had today where I go into the stream just really clueless about how to do a thing and then we just work through it and learn together and try to see what we can do or the type of stream where I pretty much know what I'm doing I've already done it before and so I just kind of go through and explain what I'm doing but there's not as much guesswork and learning as we go and it looks like some of you definitely like to see me work through things and in troubleshoot and debug so that's awesome it seems like look it seems like harsh just said harsh it said when I do have an idea that I know I get through it get more done yeah that's true so I think probably what I'll end up doing is still having having a mix Kevin says I like both let's see Zubair says this is super fine your streams are better your mistakes make us perfect cool that was that was the whole point right if I make the mistake and you see me do it then you won't have to make the mistake and learn from it because you've already seen me do it uhhuh so all right cool so it seems like you all would like to mix so I'll try to keep in mind and have a mix I made it a lot of what I do on the stream just depends on what I have to do for work anyway so I only have just a certain like range of options to choose from each day to do a stream line but I'll try to keep a nice mix and and do both so we'll be kind of adventurous sometimes in the streams and try new things like today and then other times there's gonna I mean you all know when you're building something there's some times when you just have to do a thing that you've done a hundred times before but it has to be done so we'll still have some things like that for every stream you know like setting up for every project I mean setting up the server right you gotta set up a server for every so that's that's you know not really a big thing setting up your dev environment just like basic CSS layout you know we'll do that as well Harshit says enjoying the live reloading and and rock cool I'm glad I'm glad you enjoy it didn't really do that much with it but it'll be really cool once we start putting in UI elements and being able to instantly see that feedback and inspect it and dev tools see what's happening with the store I think it would be really really cool and just I know I said this before but it was a long time ago I definitely want to give a shout out to the people at n Grove I can't remember the guys name but the guy who I guess made and rock he's he's letting us use it unlimited for free so normally to be able to have this many users on and rock at once it would it would cost money but we're able to do it for free so he's doing that for free code camp for these streams so I really appreciate that vacation s what are you making Harshit did say a bulletin for the university yes so basically it's just gonna pull in posts from WordPress and then display those posts and it's gonna have like infinite scroll for the posts and you can you'll be able to sort the post by date caddy a filter by category so you'll be able to submit your own posts now they won't automatically be there they'll go to somebody to review first before they get put in to the bulletin so that's I mean that's pretty much it just display images YouTube embeds and text and then allow users to submit a form so it's not gonna be really complicated now I will tell you this if we have time I would love to maybe add in some extra features so users have to sign in so we you know they'll have an account right so based on that account we could save user preferences so we could say preferences for how they like the UI to look we have several different options for the UI so we could save their preferences we could save preferences for I don't know what categories they want to see at the top of the page maybe give them the ability to star certain announcements or bookmark them so that they can see things it would be may be cool to have desktop notifications when new things are available so there's a lot of extra stuff that I've thought about doing and I haven't done yet so this could be a lot more complex it just kind of depends on what other projects I have going on and how you know what the deadlines are like you know if there's anything really high priority I'll have to do that instead so I can't guarantee that we'll do stuff like that but I would really like to do some stuff like that if possible see Brett says I learned graph QL while giving my daughter a bath and getting her fed amazing it is pretty amazing cool actually I forgot today is my dog my youngest daughter's birthday she turned one today so I'm really excited about that she's my youngest and she's so cute and she's also my last because my wife can't have kids anymore so I just spoiler because it's my last little baby so I can't believe she's already one but yeah actually I want to make sure I get out of here somewhat soon so that I can go home and hang out with her maxime a says who used graph QL and meteor has anybody use graph QL a meteor I'm actually I'm really interested in meteor I've seen some cool demos of things people have done with it and I know it's been around for a while is it still relevant is it worth it to learn it or is there something newer that people are moving to if it's still relevant then I definitely interested in learning how to use it and doing a project with it okay cool so Harshit says I can I can get rid of the actions that I'm using now in this app so like right now we're dispatching actions to get our data I can get rid of that and instead use graph QL queries to basically accomplish the same thing that's cool that should simplify our code quite a bit Bret said so would we eliminate Redux actually that's a good question should we eliminate Redux or do we still want to use them together I mean I definitely still would love to have data in the store to be available but yeah I don't know if anybody has any opinions on that please let me know see John Henson says while I'd love to ask a question about adding event listeners when components are there and then not then there again think I've got it but whoa oh yeah cool let let me know how that goes and if you need help with that I get yes so if you're using it in reacts with event listeners I mean normally when I have like things that I would normally use jQuery for within event listeners with when I'm doing it with react I just make sure the state changes when an action happens and then the components will you know we rendered everything will be taken care of so you know you like you could just put like an onclick attribute onto the component or the button or you know whatever has to happen or I don't know what they I don't remember what they all or but for a lot of the events that you would normally use like that you would want to do usually you can just add it as an attribute and then change the state based on when that happened okay Harshit says is Redux compulsory for this project actually no not really well to be honest with you I didn't expect to use graph QL until today I decided today we're gonna use it so at first I thought we were just going to do Redux with the WordPress REST API which is what we were doing yesterday so I like I'm open to reevaluating whether or not we should even use Redux on this project now that we're using graph QL so maybe I'll have to do some research on that and think about that maybe we don't need it I mean there's definitely some other pieces of data parts of the state that we won't make API calls to get but it would still be nice if it was available in the store so we'll see we'll see how that goes but if we don't need to keep it we can simplify things then I guess you know maybe it's not there's no not really good reason to use Redux okay so Blake I just saw your your link so I'm putting that in my address bar on my other screen right now okay so off to take a look at that maybe after the stream maybe tomorrow because I do want to leave shortly after the stream ends so but I'll leave that up on my screen so I don't forget coder Jim says I learned a lot for your videos the problem is only that I don't have enough time to keep up to date with you yeah yeah I sometimes I wonder about that too like I just put out a lot of content since we're streaming I mean we do at least an hour every day usually closer to two hours you know five days a week not always five days a week but that's that's what I shoot for I know that's a lot so I don't know it just takes a lot of my idea is that maybe I would categorize the content better have better descriptions and you know like timestamps of when I go over certain topics to help you all to be able to sift through the material and skip what you don't need it's just there's so much of it I just don't have time to do all that yet but I mean I definitely understand it's a lot to work through so for those of you who are doing it and keeping up with it that's awesome um but but anyway thanks for watching you know even if you can't watch everything I appreciate even you know whatever you all can watch that's I mean that's awesome I should says going to sleep now it's 100 a.m. all right good night thanks for watching okay thanks everyone for saying happy birthday oh my daughter's name is Cordelia so we named her Cordelia Elizabeth and in yes she's one today okay cool so yeah so Blake says every I see all right cool Blake I will check that out like I said either today or tomorrow and figure out how to get that google that link to the Google sheet working okay Brett says react definitely overshadowed media okay all right Harshit says we'll make a pool with auth system you need regular email and password as the method actually maybe did I miss something okay so maybe I missed it seems like all harsh it's probably asleep right now so if you're still awake and you're watching you can hear this I guess that's cool with the pool request I'm not exactly sure what what is what you mean about the regular email and password so anyway send me a message on Twitter or something let me know oh okay in my plant yeah so for the login right now it's a it's a password this login system so a user goes to the bulletin and they're prompted to put their email in and it has to be a email that ends with at Franciscan edu if it is that kind of email then the system right now it's using auth0 which handles you know keeping track all the users and everything but they get out their email a link they click the link it logs them in and it stores their login credentials in local storage and they stay logged in on that browser for about a year unless they clear their local storage so that's the current system so if we go with a you know a new system I still would like to keep it so that users with the Franciscan email address could still do the password this login thing I think that's best that way users don't have to worry about passwords I don't have to worry about passwords then at some point down the road I would love to tie it into our single signon system here at the University which isn't they haven't launched it yet so that's why I'm not trying to tie it in right away because I it's not ready but I'll need some some information some more information about how to tie that in I'm not even sure how they're they're implementing it it's a totally different Department is handling it so so we'll see how that goes but that's basically what I would like is as a password list system sending email links all right so I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat hopefully I didn't miss anyone's questions I will be back tomorrow like I said tomorrow maybe around like 130 1 or 130 p.m. Eastern Time it's a little bit earlier than normal but thank you all for watching and for helping me get through kind of a challenging stream because it was all new you know new techniques new technologies that I haven't used before so anyway thanks again for watching and for contributing in the live chat I will be back someone else on my Twitter was it's in the description for the video it's it's at Jesse or Weibull but you know it's in the description too she's wanted to link ok so anyway yeah thanks and I'll be back tomorrow and until then have a great day
