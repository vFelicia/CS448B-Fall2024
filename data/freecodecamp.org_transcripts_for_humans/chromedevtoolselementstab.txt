00:00 - all right in this video we are going to
00:01 - talk about the elements tab of google
00:04 - developer tools using the elements tab
00:07 - you can do a lot with html and css
00:10 - changing some other website while you're
00:12 - in the browser it's pretty cool
00:15 - so i had a camper suggest to me to work
00:18 - on this
00:19 - page which is ian mckellen's actual
00:21 - official home page it could use some css
00:24 - and html help
00:25 - we're really just gonna
00:27 - mess around with it
00:29 - so one way to get to the console or to
00:32 - the
00:33 - really just going to mess around with it
00:35 - one way to open up the developer tools
00:38 - especially when you're looking in
00:39 - elements is to right click
00:41 - and
00:42 - hit inspect element whatever you right
00:44 - clicked that's the element that it's
00:46 - going to inspect
00:47 - so here on this left side of cascading
00:50 - information it pulled up exactly
00:53 - all the information the html and over
00:55 - here it's all the style elements that
00:57 - apply to it
00:58 - let's go ahead and change that awesome
01:00 - picture of sir ian mckellen to this
01:03 - picture of a cat in a turkey costume
01:06 - so i'm just
01:07 - clicking here
01:08 - in the src
01:10 - and i'm just gonna paste my link from
01:13 - the other link
01:14 - and suddenly
01:16 - we are looking at a cat on the home page
01:19 - of mckellen.com
01:21 - additionally so say we go down here
01:23 - let's make this color not be blue
01:25 - anymore we're going to click inspect
01:27 - element and instead of changing over on
01:28 - this left cascading side we're going to
01:31 - change in here and see you can see it
01:33 - says background color if i double click
01:35 - that let's do aaa bbb
01:38 - which turns out to be this lovely light
01:40 - purple color
01:42 - so suddenly we've changed all this kind
01:44 - of stuff and we can even change text so
01:46 - if i want it to say
01:48 - i i'm continuing to right click and hit
01:51 - inspect element here it says what's new
01:53 - instead
01:54 - let's have it say
01:56 - free code camp
01:59 - is the bomb
02:00 - dot com
02:02 - there we go and now
02:04 - free code camp is the bomb.com is what
02:06 - that first little highlightable box says
02:09 - so that's pretty cool
02:11 - um additionally
02:14 - i'm going to move everything over to the
02:15 - right hand side now
02:18 - there's this kind of box over here that
02:20 - says margin border padding that's a
02:22 - really quick and easy way to edit those
02:25 - specific attributes of whatever you're
02:26 - looking at
02:28 - um
02:29 - it says margin border padding that's a
02:31 - really quick way
02:34 - to edit those attributes within the
02:36 - browser again you can't save any of this
02:37 - within the browser without changing some
02:40 - some settings um let's inspect element
02:43 - of this cat photo
02:45 - let's have it have a border
02:47 - of 10 pixels let's just see what happens
02:50 - there
02:52 - didn't save border 10
02:56 - margin
02:57 - let's try margin
02:59 - 100
03:00 - on the top
03:01 - so here it was the top number if i do it
03:04 - on the left hand side 100
03:06 - it's there right hand side 100
03:09 - bottom 100 so really all i'm doing is
03:12 - editing it in real time which is super
03:14 - cool
03:15 - padding is the same you can do this for
03:17 - anything that you're looking at on the
03:19 - web page you can edit it all here it is
03:21 - important to remember that
03:23 - cascading as far as
03:25 - what takes precedence so if there's a
03:27 - class that has an attribute that is
03:29 - applied that's still going to be more
03:31 - important to the browser than if you
03:32 - just apply it to all divs if there's a
03:35 - div class of top box
03:38 - and that has a certain color that's
03:39 - going to override any other just general
03:41 - div things that's the same as regular
03:43 - css those rules still apply here so now
03:46 - finally we're going to erase all of our
03:47 - amazing efforts here if we refresh
03:51 - everything goes back to normal
03:53 - so that's the elements page have fun
03:55 - playing around
