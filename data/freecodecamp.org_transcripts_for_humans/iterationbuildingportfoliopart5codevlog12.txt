00:27 - Perfection the first three days of this
00:29 - week I was working on uh the design
00:32 - project another thing that I learned or
00:35 - maybe rather proved once again was that
00:38 - communication is the key and scrums are
00:42 - really useful when you work on bigger
00:44 - projects whether it's for design or for
00:47 - programming iteration is the key and
00:51 - good product is never done so based on
00:54 - your prototype you conduct the user
00:56 - testing and later you uh can Implement
01:01 - solutions that would be better and
01:03 - better for your
01:04 - users it's thur day yesterday I was
01:06 - taking part in free code Camp Meetup uh
01:09 - it was another coffee and code meeting
01:12 - where we were uh discussing the
01:14 - challenges trying to fight our bus and
01:18 - uh discuss the projects we are working
01:21 - on we are doing the design critique and
01:23 - code review trying to find better
01:25 - solutions for solving our problems since
01:29 - the more morning I was organizing
01:31 - another front and Malaga Meetup and uh
01:34 - we've just announced it it will be about
01:36 - d3e and SVG today I was also learning
01:40 - about State machine and I also came back
01:42 - to um Freo C video challenges um pretty
01:46 - basic stuff but pretty useful to know
01:49 - it's Friday today I'm working on the
01:51 - design section from my portfolio I'm
01:54 - preparing the movies in order to show my
01:57 - experience in the design for the time
01:59 - think I I can say that it's done and for
02:02 - sure I will iterate on the page in the
02:05 - future maybe change some uh items in the
02:07 - portfolio later so my new about page is
02:10 - finally live next week I'm going to come
02:13 - back to react and learn more than the
02:16 - basics I also want to finish the video
02:19 - challenges that I started this week the
02:21 - video challenges from free code camp and
02:24 - next week I'm going also to revise my
02:26 - previous project from the perspective of
02:29 - State machine keep on doing and see you
02:32 - next week
