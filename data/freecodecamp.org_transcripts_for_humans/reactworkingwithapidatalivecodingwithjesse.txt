00:09 - hey everybody is Jessie a little bit
00:12 - later today than I normally am so sorry
00:16 - for everybody who you know won't be able
00:19 - to see this hopefully you can least
00:20 - catch the recording but maybe it might
00:22 - be better for some people because
00:25 - instead of coming in at the end of my
00:27 - normal 2 o'clock train you'll be at the
00:30 - beginning of the stream today that's at
00:32 - 4:30 Eastern Time it's really hot in my
00:37 - office so I do have a fan running let me
00:39 - know if that's making a lot of noise if
00:42 - it's annoying I'll turn it off it's not
00:44 - like unbearably hot so I can stand to
00:48 - turn it off today I'm gonna start out by
00:54 - showing some of the issues that I had
00:56 - yesterday that I was able to fix and
01:00 - I'll show you those had a few like
01:03 - little design changes for the the
01:05 - resource page basically I implemented a
01:09 - lot of what we had talked about
01:10 - yesterday
01:11 - and and then I'm going to show you what
01:15 - I'm doing with the API calls so we're
01:20 - gonna do I'm basically going to be
01:22 - trying to pull in as much of the content
01:24 - as I possibly can from the WordPress API
01:28 - so that the when I'm done with this
01:33 - project they'll be like really no need
01:35 - for anyone to contact me and the people
01:39 - in charge of the content for the site
01:41 - will be able to handle all that content
01:44 - so assuming that nothing like really
01:47 - crazy happens with the site I should be
01:49 - able to just just let it go off on its
01:51 - own which that'll be good I really like
01:56 - working on this I learned a lot of stuff
01:58 - but I am ready to move on it's nice to
02:03 - it's nice to start over with a clean
02:05 - slate and be able to try to do even
02:08 - better than last time
02:10 - all right so I'm just going to check
02:12 - okay great we got our view count is up
02:14 - to a decent amount I always hate to get
02:18 - like right into it before people have
02:19 - had a chance to to join in and I know
02:22 - that this was really late notice I think
02:24 - I I posted on Twitter about it like five
02:29 - minutes maybe four minutes before I was
02:32 - going to stream so they'll probably be
02:37 - some people joining in late because they
02:42 - didn't see it but I'm gonna check the
02:45 - live chat hey hi hey everyone a lot of
02:48 - people saying hi okay so Anthony says
02:53 - there's just a little bit of background
02:55 - noise not that bad
02:57 - okay so cool yeah let me know if it if
03:00 - it does end up being bad so like I'm
03:02 - actually the fan is sitting it's kind of
03:05 - blowing directly on the microphone so I
03:07 - am gonna move it a bit and then that
03:12 - should cut down on the noise and I know
03:14 - uh you know wind can makes really bad
03:19 - noise on a microphone so I don't want
03:20 - the same thing to happen here Anthony
03:23 - says I started front-end course two
03:25 - weeks ago and I finished algorithm today
03:27 - yeah all right way to go that glad to
03:32 - hear that you're you're getting through
03:33 - some of this stuff keep me up-to-date if
03:36 - you can in the live chat I'd love to to
03:38 - hear about more about your progress and
03:45 - that's yeah Sarah said Mike's catch
03:48 - everything yeah it definitely it does so
03:50 - just I'm like turn it off after a little
03:55 - while anyway it actually has done a
03:58 - decent job of getting thing called
04:00 - getting things cooled down a bit so the
04:04 - reason I didn't stream at my normal time
04:06 - listen because I had a meeting the
04:10 - meeting I might have been able to get in
04:13 - like a really really short stream in and
04:15 - still make it to the meeting but I
04:16 - didn't want to try to you know do a
04:19 - really short stream
04:20 - and have it not be kind of like as good
04:24 - as normal I probably would have had time
04:26 - to do any questions or anything so I
04:27 - thought I'd better just a postpone it I
04:29 - plan on working late today anyway
04:31 - so so this this should work out I kind
04:36 - of thought I'd be able to get out of the
04:38 - meeting so that's why I didn't I didn't
04:40 - post earlier about the time change but
04:45 - then like right before maybe like within
04:49 - an hour before the normal extreme time I
04:52 - learned that I I was I had to go to the
04:55 - meeting so that's why I was kind of late
04:59 - notice okay well let me show you
05:09 - Jordan says moving the fan didn't change
05:13 - the sound sounds like you're sitting in
05:15 - a server rooms let me let me turn the
05:20 - fan I can actually turn it down
05:23 - I'll try turning it down a little bit
05:26 - right now and then if I have to I can
05:29 - turn it off completely I also do have
05:32 - another computer on that I don't
05:33 - normally have one so and it's kind of
05:35 - noisy as well I don't know how it turned
05:38 - on I thought I had it off maybe I just
05:40 - had it asleep but I do never like a
05:42 - really old Windows laptop that I keep
05:47 - around just in case I need it so I I
05:50 - almost never need it because I use a
05:52 - browser stack for testing now but before
05:54 - I had that it did come in handy for
05:56 - testing things okay cool
06:02 - so it seems like that sounds better now
06:05 - that the fans turned on all right so let
06:07 - me start showing you a little bit about
06:10 - what's changed since yesterday what's
06:12 - been updated the development site let me
06:17 - put the link I forgot to put the link in
06:19 - the description for the show so let me
06:22 - find the link now and
06:27 - you know I'll post it here we go have a
06:30 - lot of stuff open
06:40 - so here's the link to we now have a
06:45 - development server so normally before I
06:49 - was just doing everything locally which
06:51 - is okay but you weren't able to actually
06:55 - interact with the site near the latest
06:59 - version of the site before it really
07:01 - went live unless you clone the git repo
07:05 - and ran it you know locally on your
07:08 - machine so I had already had another
07:12 - droplet already set up and ready from
07:16 - when we were testing the load balancing
07:17 - and I never I never shut that droplet
07:20 - down so I had always planned on using it
07:22 - as a development server at some point so
07:26 - that is up and running now so you can
07:27 - check out the IP address if if I forget
07:32 - to put it in the the video and you're
07:34 - watching this later on the IP address is
07:36 - 1 6 2 dot 3.2 for 3.8 6.67 oh it's not
07:46 - working again it keeps stopping so it's
07:53 - right now I'm not running it with from
07:56 - from p.m. to
08:02 - and so it's possible that I just need to
08:07 - set that up it's probably not gonna do
08:11 - it right now
08:19 - there you go so
08:28 - I'm gonna start it up again alright it
08:34 - should be working now so I'm gonna try
08:37 - to refresh my page in my other screen
08:39 - okay it is working out I just didn't
08:42 - take the time to set it up in a more
08:44 - reliable way because at first I was only
08:47 - using it just to just to test a few
08:52 - things out but since then I had requests
08:57 - from other people to work here to see
08:58 - the site so now I probably ought to set
09:00 - it up in a better way
09:11 - push-push Pinder asks about is it
09:16 - possible to get the live session on the
09:17 - weekend the recording will be available
09:19 - so you can definitely check out the
09:22 - recording I probably won't do another
09:25 - live session on the weekend but the
09:28 - recording is definitely available so
09:30 - it'll be right here on the free code
09:32 - camp channel there's actually a playlist
09:34 - for all the streams so if you don't see
09:37 - it on like the main page you can check
09:39 - the playlist is just called live coding
09:41 - with Jesse but if you're gonna view it
09:44 - you know sometimes the next day or two
09:45 - it'll probably one of the first videos
09:47 - up on the main page
09:56 - okay
09:59 - all right so let me show you now you can
10:03 - see the site now and actually I don't
10:04 - have it looks like I don't have the the
10:07 - very latest stuff but so I'll bring the
10:10 - latest stuff up on my screen
10:18 - okay see I was wondering where am i when
10:21 - my browser window went so went here I
10:24 - think I have it the site up somewhere
10:29 - else so let's pull it over and now I
10:37 - can't find it
10:42 - oh well not a problem just go to
10:48 - localhost okay so nothing new so yeah
10:56 - nothing new there on the about page
11:03 - figures my dev server needs to be
11:06 - started again I never bothered to figure
11:11 - out why my dev server always needs
11:13 - restarted and only on this computer I
11:17 - can run the same same stuff on my other
11:22 - computers and it works so anyway so on
11:24 - this page it doesn't look like much has
11:26 - changed but all of this data is now
11:28 - being pulled in from the wordpress api
11:32 - so all the text with the exception of I
11:37 - think this title is still hard-coded and
11:39 - the image you can see I need to work on
11:43 - the formatting a bit I think WordPress
11:46 - is automatically wrapping this in a P
11:47 - tag and so it's messing up the
11:49 - formatting so I'll have to I'll have to
11:52 - account for that it'll probably be
11:55 - easier just to account for that in the
11:57 - code then to try to change how WordPress
11:59 - does things because sometimes I do want
12:02 - them to actually use wrap things in P
12:04 - tags but sometimes I don't the only
12:08 - visible change here other than that kind
12:10 - of mistake is I'm actually pulling in
12:15 - the the test pages now the data before I
12:19 - had just made some lists just just to
12:22 - see how it would look now I'm actually
12:24 - pulling this in so when we click it the
12:27 - link works and it goes to our page it's
12:31 - still just test data but hopefully we'll
12:38 - get some real data in there and be able
12:40 - to kind of get a better idea of how it
12:41 - looks and on our resources page this is
12:46 - where we have the biggest change so I
12:48 - switched up from the black which you can
12:52 - see on the dev site right now
12:55 - so I had the black before and I've
12:58 - switched it to the red the red
13:01 - background with it has like this semi
13:04 - transparent background image kind of
13:08 - going across here and then now you know
13:12 - everything's white the check marks end
13:15 - up being like that gold color that's on
13:17 - the site so I'm not sure if I like it
13:22 - being gold what I might end up switching
13:23 - it back to white but for now I think the
13:25 - gold is okay
13:28 - so before some of this stuff was gray
13:31 - but it just doesn't look very good
13:33 - against the red so I did I got some
13:35 - feedback yesterday from you all and I
13:38 - got some feedback from some of the
13:39 - people involved in the project here
13:41 - where I work and general consensus was
13:44 - going with the red would probably be
13:46 - better so with the red and then I
13:47 - increased the padding a bit just to kind
13:49 - of it looked really weird with this
13:51 - background image when it was shorter so
13:56 - that's why I increased the padding a bit
13:59 - but basically everything still functions
14:03 - the same way so everything works I
14:06 - didn't get a chance to check this out on
14:09 - multiple browsers so we did have a an
14:14 - issue open up on github based on what we
14:17 - saw in the stream yesterday and that was
14:21 - that on some browsers especially windows
14:24 - browsers one of them in Windows this
14:27 - this doesn't look right so I'll still
14:32 - have to check that out on some browsers
14:34 - but I didn't want to do it if I was
14:36 - gonna change a lot of the colors anyway
14:38 - I wanted to wait until I changed it
14:40 - before I tried to troubleshoot that so
14:43 - that's something I'll be doing soon or
14:45 - that's something that's that's open for
14:47 - for anybody to you know try out if you'd
14:50 - like to and submit a pull request I did
14:53 - have a pull request that I pulled in
14:55 - from Bill so let me show you I'll be
15:00 - I'll show you and I'll explain to you so
15:02 - since I've only pulled it in on the dev
15:03 - branch I don't think he shows up yet
15:07 - in the official like contributors page
15:09 - but basically bills contributions were
15:13 - pretty nice and that he I didn't have a
15:18 - unique ID a unique key for each of these
15:21 - which you need and reactor it gives you
15:22 - an error message it still loads it but
15:25 - within the console you get an error
15:27 - message in dev tools and then he added
15:30 - this is actually a horizontal rule now
15:32 - before we had a black bottom border now
15:35 - this is an HR and with some shadows and
15:39 - gradients and things going on actually I
15:43 - think this is how do you do is I think
15:45 - this was a background gradient so I only
15:49 - changed what bill sent in just a bit so
15:52 - I just lightened it a bit I checked out
15:55 - the material design documentation on how
15:57 - to do lists and they're lines between
16:01 - the lists are very light so I decided to
16:04 - go with that since we're kind of trying
16:06 - to follow material design principles
16:08 - here and also he put in a little bit of
16:15 - code to make sure that the last in the
16:18 - list the last element in the list
16:21 - doesn't have an HR at the bottom so
16:28 - that's it not not a whole lot happening
16:33 - I didn't get to do quite as much work as
16:37 - I had hopes because I had meetings like
16:42 - kind of unexpected meetings this morning
16:45 - that lasted lasted a while but it was
16:48 - good I guess we'll get feedback for this
16:49 - site so it worked out alright so I'm
16:54 - gonna move this over because I don't
16:56 - really need it right now
16:56 - we'll leave this here so we can keep
16:58 - referring back to it but I want to show
17:02 - you let me uh organize this a bit better
17:09 - here we go but I want to show you the
17:12 - about page and how I pulled in the the
17:16 - data and actually let me check the live
17:22 - chat I had an idea so normally I use a
17:24 - Pomodoro timer so you use this and I
17:28 - thought I should I'm gonna start using
17:30 - this timer now and that way if it goes
17:34 - off it'll be a reminder for me to check
17:36 - the live chat so I don't forget so
17:39 - hopefully I'll check it you know before
17:43 - it goes off but just in case you know at
17:45 - least every 25 minutes I'll check it and
17:47 - then that'll give me just a little
17:49 - reminder of how long these things are
17:51 - taking because I usually forget to
17:53 - record how long things take during my
17:56 - streaming so let me check back in the in
18:05 - the chat here okay not a whole lot going
18:07 - on the chat hey Sebastian how's it going
18:10 - but my employer is now in the live chat
18:12 - Franciscan University Steubenville it's
18:15 - not it's it's actually the the guy that
18:18 - works in the office right next to me he
18:20 - must just be logged into the Franciscan
18:22 - University YouTube account so he told me
18:29 - that my mom was online too but instead
18:34 - of he's just kidding
18:42 - okay so John says thin light thin border
18:45 - lines are easiest by using one pixel
18:48 - inset and a very light gray okay cool I
18:55 - might try that I am I kind of just went
18:57 - with what what bill had for this and
19:00 - just lightened it a bit but if I get a
19:03 - chance maybe I'll try to you know change
19:05 - it even more I wouldn't mind it being a
19:08 - bit thinner I mean I think this I think
19:11 - this looks fine to me but but a little
19:16 - bit thinner probably would match more
19:18 - with what's in the material design
19:20 - documentation so so thanks for that I'm
19:23 - like I'm kind of getting down to the
19:25 - wire here so I'm only gonna work on
19:27 - things that are absolutely necessary but
19:30 - I can see like I'm I'm a little bit
19:34 - confident now that I can get done what I
19:35 - need to get done before the 20th and
19:40 - then I'll switch to another project but
19:42 - it seems like I'm gonna be able to get
19:43 - things done I say that knowing that I
19:48 - usually run into unforeseen issues that
19:53 - take longer so assuming that I don't run
19:57 - into too many of those should get
19:59 - everything done then I won't have to
20:01 - work crazy hours all right so I'm gonna
20:07 - show you what I gonna show you all the
20:09 - about page I have the music I'm playing
20:15 - in my headphones is from Spotify
20:17 - throwbackthursday playlist and this week
20:19 - it's on 90s music and so if you grew up
20:22 - in the 90s like I did it will be
20:26 - nostalgic for you
20:27 - I find myself remembering like lots of
20:29 - stuff that happened in middle school in
20:32 - grade school that I associate with these
20:37 - songs alright so
20:43 - at the top here before so as of
20:46 - yesterday I wasn't pulling any data in
20:50 - for this page it was all coded directly
20:54 - into this component now I'm gonna pull
20:58 - in more data so the big problem that
21:00 - I've been wrestling with and I've
21:02 - mentioned it a few times on the in the
21:07 - live stream is that I needed a way to
21:09 - get multiple data from multiple
21:13 - different post types in one API call so
21:17 - I needed it to be here because I wanted
21:19 - anything in here gets rendered on the
21:22 - server so the API call will actually get
21:26 - made on the server and everything will
21:28 - get rendered and then the data will get
21:31 - sent to the client as an HTML page and
21:36 - then it can also be made when you do
21:39 - client-side routing so the same call
21:42 - could be made on the client the problem
21:44 - was when I tried to write some code to
21:47 - do multiple calls inside here
21:49 - I always got errors it's possible that
21:52 - there's a way to do it and I just I just
21:54 - couldn't figure it out
21:56 - so I found another way there's a plugin
21:59 - for the WordPress for WordPress that
22:03 - exposes this endpoint this multiple post
22:06 - type endpoint and then you can say what
22:10 - types of posts you want so right now I
22:12 - want the PDF page post type and then I
22:15 - want just the page post type I didn't
22:19 - want to do this because you can't if you
22:22 - specify parameters for you know for how
22:25 - you want to narrow this data down the
22:28 - parameters apply to every post type so
22:30 - it's not that useful because certain
22:34 - post types have different they have
22:36 - different data that's coming through and
22:39 - I have different needs to the post type
22:40 - so what I'm gonna have to do to make
22:42 - this work is this is fine but I'm now
22:44 - going to end up getting more data
22:46 - I would normally need and it should work
22:50 - for most pages the only pages where it's
22:52 - going to be a little bit tough is if I
22:55 - happen to have a page that has a lot of
22:56 - different data I might not get it all
22:59 - with this hundred per page thing and
23:02 - that's that's the WordPress limit you
23:04 - can't easily get more than 100 posts per
23:06 - page and I don't have time to try to
23:07 - work around that so probably what will
23:10 - end up happening is everything that's
23:12 - essential that I really want to be
23:14 - rendered on the server will be in this
23:15 - first API call and then if there's other
23:17 - things that should be rendered later on
23:20 - they can be rendered later on I'll
23:22 - render it in another API call so usually
23:25 - it'll be based on a user interaction and
23:26 - that's fine so then upon that
23:28 - interaction it'll make the call and and
23:30 - that should be fine it should work if
23:32 - for some reason there's a page where
23:34 - there's some data that just needs to
23:36 - display and there's no user interaction
23:38 - I can make it happen on a scroll so
23:41 - perhaps if a user gets like halfway down
23:43 - the page then I'll make the call and
23:45 - load the stuff at the bottom of the page
23:47 - it should work out none of the pages
23:49 - right now are so big that it won't work
23:52 - but today I'm actually gonna do some of
23:55 - this I'm kind of showing you how I did
23:56 - it first and then I'm gonna do it on
23:59 - some pages so we'll find out if it'll
24:03 - work for all the pages but since I did
24:05 - that the API call I get back has all the
24:11 - PDF pages and all the page post types
24:15 - and so down here I started doing things
24:19 - like for the intersection I made a page
24:23 - in WordPress called about intro so I'm
24:27 - grabbing the the page that has about
24:32 - interest I'm using filter and then I'm
24:36 - I'm rendering the content of that page
24:40 - inside this this column div so I've had
24:44 - to move the float X class up here to the
24:46 - column instead of having it on the P tag
24:48 - which is fine because I don't want the
24:52 - person entering things in WordPress to
24:53 - have to worry about any code so why
24:55 - don't you just be able to use the the
24:57 - WYSIWYG in WordPress which will
24:59 - automatically add
25:00 - eat eggs but it won't automatically add
25:01 - the classes we want one thing I didn't
25:04 - know about is I use the map here just
25:06 - because I was copy and pasting some
25:07 - stuff I was doing elsewhere there's only
25:10 - one post that I really want so I'm not
25:11 - sure if I have to use map so if there's
25:14 - a better way to do this where I can just
25:16 - grab this right from filter and use it
25:18 - let me know if anybody knows it if not
25:22 - I'm I'm not really gonna take the time
25:24 - to look it up right now because this
25:25 - works and this is okay because if I ever
25:29 - have to grab more than one post type and
25:32 - render it it's already set up to be able
25:34 - to handle that but for now this is the
25:38 - sodus you see I've done that for each
25:40 - section so let me show you let's go back
25:43 - to the about page just to see so each
25:45 - section is now its own page in WordPress
25:48 - and I can show you what it looks like in
25:51 - WordPress as well so in WordPress if we
25:58 - go to pages see I have about intro
26:02 - that's the top part the about quote
26:05 - banner is down here section 2 section 3
26:13 - so that's what I'm gonna do the only
26:15 - things that aren't on there right now
26:18 - these I didn't put in they're not
26:21 - editable in these for now I don't think
26:24 - I'm going to put them in because the
26:26 - odds of these changing are really small
26:31 - so there's not really high turn over
26:35 - here at the university especially for
26:37 - the upper level positions you know once
26:39 - people get up there they stay there
26:40 - forever until they're ready to retire
26:44 - also I'm not sure that these will change
26:47 - soon enough so if I have time later on
26:50 - maybe I'll do this but for now I think
26:52 - it's okay to keep these hard-coded
26:54 - because for these I would have to
26:57 - probably have to make custom post types
26:59 - so it's a little bit more work than just
27:01 - an extra page so I want to make a custom
27:04 - post type for this you know kind of bio
27:06 - card and then iterate over that
27:09 - render it and then the same thing here
27:13 - it would be a custom post type for these
27:15 - collaborator cards so I don't want to do
27:17 - all that for those sections right now
27:19 - since they're not likely to change but I
27:24 - want to check out we'll start with the
27:26 - home page and we'll just check out my
27:31 - service topic this is driving me crazy
27:36 - if I had only just took like you know 15
27:40 - minutes a month ago to fix this when it
27:43 - first happened I wouldn't have to worry
27:45 - about this and I still I still never
27:49 - take the time all right so on the home
27:55 - page I'm gonna leave all this up here
27:59 - hard-coded this is not likely to change
28:01 - and I really don't want it to change
28:03 - because all of the spacing and
28:05 - everything on all the screen sizes is
28:08 - pretty exact if someone went in here and
28:11 - changed this and made it a lot bigger or
28:13 - something it it would mess everything up
28:15 - so don't want that to change
28:19 - the video for now I'm gonna leave it
28:23 - like this at some point it might not be
28:24 - a bad idea to have a page with a custom
28:28 - field that was just the embed code for
28:31 - this video to be able to change it but
28:35 - for now I think it's it's okay like that
28:37 - I want to make these their own custom
28:40 - post type so we'll definitely be pulling
28:44 - in we're gonna make the post type for
28:46 - this and then pull in the data the the
28:51 - image for this is gonna change but I
28:57 - don't think I'm gonna take the time to
28:59 - put it in here if I'm gonna make this
29:01 - editable from WordPress then we'll see
29:05 - maybe the person in charge of the
29:07 - content will do that the person in
29:11 - charge of the content and her name is
29:12 - Amy
29:13 - I always just keep saying the person in
29:15 - charge of the content but it's much
29:17 - shorter to just say Amy so Amy is gonna
29:19 - put
29:20 - probably put the the new image in I can
29:24 - show you the image though this is it's
29:26 - going to be this image so which will
29:30 - work well because then the the title
29:32 - will go down here and this section will
29:33 - be darkened a bit so it's perfect image
29:35 - too to put the title there it won't
29:37 - really block anything this section which
29:43 - I've already made a page for this
29:46 - section will be editable I'm glad Google
29:51 - Calendar let me know that today is
29:52 - garbage day or tomorrow is garbage day
29:55 - so I need to put the garbage out today
29:56 - so glad for that reminder and then these
30:01 - will be pulled in from the API as well
30:05 - so we're gonna have three three
30:09 - different sections so we're going to
30:13 - need three different post types this
30:14 - will be a from the page post type this
30:17 - will be from I guess we'll call this the
30:20 - formation cards yeah I'm not sure what
30:25 - else to call them right now but the
30:27 - formation card post type and this will
30:30 - come from the the news or the blog
30:33 - actually we won't need to make a new
30:35 - post type because I'm gonna pull these
30:37 - from there just the normal posts that
30:40 - are built in to WordPress so that should
30:43 - be okay as is and if I have time I may
30:50 - change how these look but I think
30:53 - they're okay right now I just don't like
30:57 - that I've like kind of made them all
30:59 - have a max height and there's all this
31:02 - space but I'm not sure I'll have time to
31:06 - really do what I need to to make them
31:08 - look how I want them to look all right
31:11 - so let's go in and work on this I'll
31:16 - connect this up first and these because
31:19 - I already have the post types made and
31:21 - then I'll decide whether or not I
31:23 - actually want to make a new post type
31:25 - during the stream or not let me know in
31:27 - the live chat if you'd like to see me
31:28 - create a post site but I've already done
31:30 - it a few times so you may not even want
31:33 - to see
31:33 - again it doesn't take very long but may
31:40 - not be very interesting all right
31:44 - oops not moose no is there some setting
31:51 - that I can edit so that the my Mac
32:00 - doesn't automatically change the order
32:02 - of my my desktops like that's for some
32:07 - reason it always does that and I don't
32:08 - like it I have them in the order that I
32:10 - want them in alright so we need to find
32:15 - our home pages are the index page and
32:22 - make it slightly bigger check this so
32:30 - I'm gonna grab the about page and move
32:35 - it over I have so much going on here
32:37 - let me get rid of some of these things
32:44 - serious like such changes no I don't
32:47 - think I changed it no okay so oh you
32:56 - know what I had I just occurred to me I
32:58 - had one other error that kept happening
33:00 - at the end and I didn't show you how I
33:02 - fixed that error so the error was that
33:06 - every time I tried to go to one of those
33:07 - single pages that the PDF pages that we
33:13 - were linking to from the about page I
33:15 - would get an error about the side nav
33:17 - init function and I figured out what the
33:20 - problem was the problem was that in the
33:27 - layouts so in in the layout components I
33:35 - didn't have these two dots here so it
33:39 - was just going to static jazz app
33:41 - touches which was fine normally it was
33:45 - working normally
33:46 - for some reason when it was coming from
33:50 - one of those pages that we were using
33:53 - the parameterised routing for it just
33:57 - wasn't working so the reason it I didn't
34:02 - catch it before was because the the one
34:04 - page that I was looking off of that did
34:06 - work was he wasn't using the layout it
34:09 - was using the old style of how we did
34:11 - this so anyway that's all I had to fix
34:13 - and it fixed everything so it took a
34:15 - while to figure it out but it was an
34:18 - easy fix once once I did all right so
34:24 - now I'm going to take the about page and
34:25 - move it over here so that we can copy
34:28 - and paste some stuff if we need to and I
34:32 - do want to copy and paste this it's not
34:37 - really fun to type out so we want to hit
34:44 - that end point that multiple post type
34:46 - end point that we get from the plug-in
34:50 - and we're gonna need we don't need PDF
34:55 - page when you post
34:59 - I think post is the post type we'll see
35:03 - in a second we either get the data we
35:05 - want and then we want page we haven't
35:07 - made that other post type yet so I'm not
35:09 - I'm going to try to get it because we'll
35:10 - get an error and I can check this right
35:15 - away to see if it worked by going into
35:17 - dev tools for the site and we can go
35:23 - into the react dev tools screen and
35:26 - we'll see our props up here oops we're
35:33 - getting an empty objects I did something
35:35 - wrong so let me maybe I need to say
35:38 - posts which I it again
35:46 - hmm
35:50 - still not get anything all right so I'm
35:58 - gonna just grab this and we'll try it
36:01 - out right in the browser
36:14 - hmm not getting anything
36:20 - okay we should have gotten something on
36:22 - that first time
36:33 - oops I grabbed the wrong site it ought
36:36 - to it auto-filled this other site which
36:39 - I also built in a similar way okay so
36:46 - this is better so this is giving us what
36:48 - we need
36:49 - I'm not sure why it didn't work the
36:50 - first time I did it let's try it again
36:56 - and I'm gonna manually refresh this it's
37:04 - possible it was just a refresh problem
37:07 - there we go and now we have everything
37:11 - safe - props and we can filter things by
37:18 - its type if we need to or filter by
37:23 - anything we want but for the news part
37:27 - we're gonna filter by post and then
37:32 - we're gonna filter secondarily by we
37:38 - have a custom field where's our custom
37:42 - field ID so why our type inside this
37:47 - advanced custom field okay I'm gonna
37:52 - check the lights out again it's been a
37:53 - while this timer actually is really
37:56 - helping me to remember how long it's
37:58 - been
38:09 - d 404 says just arrived welcome also
38:16 - after you use the fetch API to get your
38:19 - data I do I do tests or I do use the
38:24 - fetch API so I recommend using it if you
38:27 - haven't tried it yet definitely try it
38:29 - out it's way easier than any other
38:31 - method I've ever used to make API calls
38:33 - and don't worry about the browser
38:40 - support just use the polyfill so as long
38:46 - as you use the polyfill you should be
38:48 - fine on most modern browsers it even
38:52 - works on it works on Internet Explorer
38:54 - 11 so definitely it's definitely worth
39:00 - learning it'll save you time it's just
39:04 - so much more simple I really like it a
39:07 - lot better then do the other ways of
39:11 - making API calls with you know Ajax or
39:14 - you know just like a plain xhr request
39:19 - Sebastian asks what do you need tested
39:21 - on edge ok the yeah the drop down the
39:29 - the select input on the resources page
39:33 - was acting weird if you check out the
39:36 - the github repo there's an issue open
39:41 - for that
39:50 - okay so Sarah Sarah tested her on
39:53 - Firefox and it looks fine on Firefox
39:54 - that's awesome but it looks like she
39:57 - said Opera and Chrome on on windows are
40:05 - not it's like waiting out everything so
40:08 - I have to test that out
40:19 - okay yeah if you want to see it in
40:22 - action I did put a link in so maybe for
40:27 - everyone that's come in a little bit
40:30 - later on I'll put the link in the live
40:32 - chat again for the dev server hopefully
40:35 - it's working and it didn't quit working
40:38 - again okay it's still working so should
40:44 - be able to go there
40:48 - okay blad says just landed here why does
40:51 - jessie have a timer running it's a
40:54 - Pomodoro timer which I usually run this
40:56 - all the time when I'm working and I
40:58 - record how long it takes me to do
41:01 - everything I record that in my Trello
41:04 - board so you can check out my Trello
41:06 - board I just not realised I have my
41:08 - calendar up here so I've been showing
41:09 - everyone everything I'm doing all month
41:11 - so I hope there's nothing embarrassing
41:12 - up there
41:13 - and it's not as my wife's calendar on
41:15 - there too so I really don't have a good
41:18 - idea of what's on there because she
41:20 - could have put anything in there so
41:21 - maybe I'll have to move that to another
41:24 - screen for future streams or just get
41:28 - rid of it maybe that's better I'll just
41:30 - headaches it out of anyway so like these
41:36 - numbers that are on my Trello board and
41:38 - there's a link to my Trello board in the
41:39 - description if you want to check it out
41:41 - these are like the dark numbers or how
41:44 - many plummeted or cycles I estimate that
41:46 - a task will take and then the greyed out
41:48 - ones or the the slightly transparent
41:53 - ones are how long it actually has taken
41:57 - me so this is really helpful for me to
42:01 - be able to like I can go back in and see
42:03 - how long things took me before it's
42:05 - helpful for being able to accurately
42:06 - estimate future projects how much time
42:09 - it will take me and it is helpful as
42:13 - well for me to remember just to take a
42:15 - break because otherwise I would just
42:17 - keep working and working and lose track
42:19 - of time so for every time I get through
42:23 - a 25-minute session I take a five minute
42:25 - break after four sessions I take a ten
42:28 - minute break which is the long gray
42:29 - and during that time I can check my
42:32 - email I check Twitter you know get up
42:35 - and walk around so often times that'll
42:40 - be a nice break for me to just evaluate
42:42 - like is what I'm doing right now the
42:44 - most important thing I could be doing
42:46 - should I switch to something else like
42:47 - just gives my brain a break and I
42:50 - noticed when I don't do that I can they
42:53 - get stuck on one problem for hours and
42:55 - hours and not get anywhere and sometimes
43:00 - I shouldn't worried about that problem I
43:02 - should have just let it go and moved on
43:04 - but since I never really stopped to
43:06 - think about it I don't make that
43:08 - decision so this is a really nice way of
43:10 - doing things and I know I've seen
43:19 - actually a lot of people use this and
43:21 - there's even a one of the free code camp
43:23 - challenges is to make your own Pomodoro
43:26 - clock I haven't gotten to that challenge
43:28 - yet so I am still working through my
43:31 - free code camp front-end certification
43:36 - it's actually I'm gonna do here's what
43:40 - I'm gonna do I'm gonna do my short break
43:41 - and then I know if this time is up then
43:44 - I should probably get back to coding
43:45 - again our likeness this I'm gonna try to
43:49 - remember this from now on we're gonna do
43:50 - Pomodoro sessions and we're gonna try to
43:54 - stick to during the session we code and
43:56 - then during the break we talk and that
44:03 - might be a more that'll be a nicer flow
44:07 - for things and then it'll let you all
44:10 - know like what's coming yeah I like that
44:14 - idea let me know if you think about that
44:16 - I think it should it should work but has
44:23 - anybody made the Pomodoro timer and the
44:27 - free code camp thing right now I'm
44:29 - working on my well I should say I
44:33 - finished working on my weather my
44:35 - weather thing my weather app but I
44:37 - didn't I didn't move on like I didn't
44:40 - end in a link to
44:41 - anything because I was gonna style it
44:44 - but functionally it can it works it
44:46 - works fine I just haven't done any
44:47 - anything to style it yet and I built it
44:51 - in reacts all right so I'm gonna check
44:58 - out
45:06 - okay so it looks like Sebastian also is
45:09 - verifying that chrome and edge or white
45:12 - for that talking about this this
45:18 - drop-down is it's all white and you
45:22 - can't see anything on chrome and edge
45:24 - for for Windows so I have to work on
45:28 - that
45:29 - oh yes Patrick you're my hero today
45:35 - alright so a few minutes ago I had asked
45:38 - about these desktops being rearranged
45:46 - automatically and I don't want that to
45:48 - happen so Patrick just sent me
45:51 - instructions on how to do this so I'll
45:55 - do it on this screen so in case you've
45:57 - ever had a similar problem we have
45:59 - System Preferences and Mission Control
46:04 - and uncheck oh wow that's really obvious
46:09 - so I even asked that everybody I should
46:12 - have just I should have just checked so
46:18 - we'll uncheck that and then that will
46:20 - fix the problem
46:23 - awesome I'm actually I was like a
46:28 - Windows user for my entire life until I
46:30 - got this job and I've been working here
46:34 - for almost two years so I've only been a
46:37 - Mac user for about two years less than
46:40 - two years so still don't really know
46:43 - enough and and actually I come way
46:47 - behind because Windows 10 like I haven't
46:49 - really used Windows 10 that much so I
46:52 - don't know what's going on there so I
46:54 - feel like I'm not really an expert in
46:56 - any operating system like if you like
47:00 - put me in front of a Windows XP computer
47:03 - then I would be fine I can do anything
47:06 - you want me to do but right now I am NOT
47:09 - not an expert at any operating system
47:13 - oh cool
47:16 - so Patrick actually like look that up
47:19 - and figured it out because that annoyed
47:22 - him as well so awesome Thank You Patrick
47:24 - thanks for taking the time to do that
47:28 - okay Vlad says it's a really interesting
47:31 - way to keep track and make sure you're
47:32 - working smart I may steal the process
47:34 - from you yeah feel free to steal it for
47:36 - me I took it from somebody else
47:38 - so I definitely did not invent this I
47:41 - did a course on Pluralsight because I
47:44 - got a free like three months
47:46 - subscription to Flora site and there was
47:49 - a course on using agile methodologies
47:52 - for one
47:53 - so usually agile was used for teams well
47:56 - I pretty much work just myself on all my
47:59 - projects so I thought it sounded really
48:03 - cool and I took the course and part of
48:06 - the course was talking about the
48:07 - Pomodoro timer and so that's where I
48:11 - picked that up from and I thought I'd
48:13 - give it a trial and use it for a few
48:14 - weeks and see how I liked it and that
48:17 - was last year and I've liked it so much
48:19 - I've continued to use it for for all my
48:23 - my projects occasionally I'll do a
48:26 - little side project where I won't use it
48:28 - but sometimes even on side projects I I
48:32 - still use it because it's still a good
48:34 - idea to you know break up the work like
48:36 - that
48:43 - okay Sara says she's on the jQuery part
48:47 - now for free code camp so cool yeah that
48:51 - would be cool if you all are doing the
48:52 - free code camp stuff too it would be fun
48:54 - to know what what part you all are on so
48:57 - if you're in the live chat right now and
48:59 - you can type go ahead and type if you
49:02 - feel like sharing of like about where
49:05 - you're at and if you're watching this
49:08 - later on you put it in the comments
49:11 - that'd be really cool just to get an
49:13 - idea of where we're all at if if if you
49:16 - are doing the free code camp challenges
49:19 - I had a question about the Trello Adams
49:23 - so actually so my my time here for my
49:27 - short break is up so I'm just gonna
49:28 - answer this last question and then get
49:30 - back to the code the question was about
49:33 - the Trello add-ons that I'm using with
49:35 - the Pomodoro Technique
49:36 - so yeah that's a great question let me I
49:39 - believe that this is actually a Chrome
49:43 - extension so let me see let's assume my
49:49 - extensions are okay so here are my
49:56 - extensions I'm gonna make this
49:57 - bigger yeah okay so where's that
50:07 - there we go so the extension is called
50:10 - scrum for Trello so I think that's it I
50:17 - think on a previous livestream I may
50:20 - have said that it was a Trello add-on
50:24 - but I think I was mistaken so I
50:27 - apologize if anybody tried to add this
50:29 - in Trello and couldn't find the add-on
50:31 - but then later on I I realized that it
50:35 - was an extension and I had meant to
50:39 - mention it in a stream after that and
50:41 - then I forgot until now so so that's
50:44 - really cool while I'm in here my
50:46 - extensions I'll show you this is a
50:48 - really useful extension this tells me
50:52 - like how what websites are built on so
50:54 - I'm constantly using this when I see a
50:56 - website that I like or one that's really
50:59 - terrible and I just want to see like
51:00 - what what do they build this with yeah
51:04 - this is Michael tampermonkey is the one
51:06 - that you need to make the colors on
51:09 - github change so react dev tools is how
51:14 - I get the react stuff in the in from
51:18 - developer tools and something what else
51:23 - all the JSON format err definitely
51:26 - recommend that if you want to check out
51:27 - JSON data that's why when I look at the
51:30 - data from the WordPress API it looks
51:32 - nice and not all jumbled and I think
51:36 - that's it for like developer stuff
51:38 - browsers that local I've actually never
51:40 - used this I download this and I never
51:42 - used it at all so I can't really say
51:44 - whether it's good or not and then
51:47 - retired j/s is kind of cool you can see
51:49 - if there's any vulnerable JavaScript
51:51 - libraries being used on any of your
51:53 - sites it's not bad but I found like 99%
51:56 - of the time it just shows like some
51:58 - version of jQuery as being vulnerable
52:02 - which which is ok but it's not like that
52:08 - useful because if everybody is using
52:11 - this same vulnerable version like I
52:13 - don't I don't know like there's got to
52:15 - be some version of jQuery that's not
52:17 - vulnerable but it seems like everybody
52:19 - that's using jQuery
52:20 - it shows up as vulnerable so anyway
52:24 - hopefully that was a little bit helpful
52:28 - can't believe I never thought of showing
52:30 - that before because I use those really
52:32 - often so you can see this is that
52:36 - analyzer here it's telling me that
52:38 - Trello was built with jQuery they're
52:41 - using Quantcast for analytics and Google
52:43 - tag manager and Google Analytics so this
52:46 - is actually this is crazy
52:48 - I wouldn't guest:i if I were to guess
52:50 - that I thought Trello was built with
52:52 - some sort of like JavaScript framework
52:54 - but it's it's actually just all jQuery
52:57 - crazy I've been surprised to see how
53:01 - many sites are built with react now that
53:04 - I didn't realize her built with react so
53:06 - which one was I was on GoDaddy recently
53:09 - and GoDaddy site is now built with react
53:12 - that was a little surprising Wow okay so
53:17 - the song you guys remember the song
53:20 - Mmmbop from the 90s from by a Hansen
53:23 - that just came on I'm definitely gonna
53:24 - skip that it's nostalgic but not not
53:31 - really the song I want to listen to
53:40 - okay so let me get back to the code now
53:43 - I did ask a question and I'm getting
53:46 - answers in the live chat I'll read them
53:47 - off really quick it's not really polite
53:52 - to ask a question and then ignore the
53:54 - answers oh cool so Patrick has done the
54:00 - Pomodoro thing and actually put a link
54:02 - to it in the live chat so I'm gonna
54:08 - check it out and while that's loading
54:17 - yeah
54:19 - that's nachiket says join the camp only
54:23 - a day ago and have reached only till
54:25 - bootstrap also well you got a good start
54:29 - good start keep doing keep going and
54:32 - keep us updated on how it goes inside
54:36 - the matrix is on the twitch API projects
54:38 - about halfway done with it also gave
54:44 - your Pomodoro a heart Patrick all right
54:47 - cool it oh okay so here's Patrick's
54:49 - Pomodoro nice
54:58 - I like that okay
55:06 - oh so it automatically takes you into
55:08 - the break interesting that's cool we can
55:11 - double click to reset that's really cool
55:17 - I'm gonna check out the code to this
55:19 - later on that's awesome yeah thanks for
55:22 - uh thanks for sharing that link
55:32 - hey Andrew so Andrew joining us welcome
55:40 - glad you can make it inside the matrix
55:45 - says I've been listening in 90s rock
55:46 - such alternative on Pandora lately so
55:49 - many middle-school memories yeah we must
55:52 - be a brown the same age because that's I
55:54 - was in grade school in Middle School in
55:56 - the 90s as well so it's always it's
56:00 - always fun to listen to the old music
56:03 - and then just have all these memories
56:05 - come up
56:22 - Manny says it would be cool to link the
56:24 - timer to the Trello board and have it
56:27 - forcefully limit how much time you can
56:29 - spend on each feature I think it would
56:31 - increase productivity man he also says
56:35 - 90s for the best hey Manny I'm not I'm
56:40 - not sure if I've seen you post in the
56:42 - live chat before so I may be mistaken
56:45 - but if this is your first time posting
56:47 - then welcome and thanks for contributing
56:51 - here in the live chat yeah Manny that's
56:55 - like a really really good idea I'm not
56:58 - sure how I would accomplish that but I
57:00 - think that would be a really cool side
57:03 - project
57:14 - okay jonbi says hi hi again hey how's it
57:17 - going glad you could make it alright so
57:22 - let me go back I spent a lot more time
57:25 - so that the Pomodoro timer only really
57:29 - is effective if you if you pay attention
57:32 - to it and actually stop working or start
57:36 - working when you're supposed to that's a
57:39 - top tip for me you have to be
57:44 - disciplined about it alright so now
57:46 - we're back on our homepage we're getting
57:48 - the data that we need so now all we have
57:50 - to do is render that data in the right
57:54 - places so okay I was thinking that
58:00 - where's all their stuff that I forgot
58:03 - it's down the bottom because this is the
58:05 - alternate version of the homepage that
58:07 - will end up being the new version all
58:15 - right so this is where we're gonna put
58:18 - our the data from our quote so I need to
58:25 - figure out what the what the slug is for
58:28 - that so let me do that you find the slug
58:40 - pretty sure it as the word quote in it
58:54 - maybe it doesn't I have to bring up the
58:59 - the actual WordPress and bring it over
59:03 - let's see oh I didn't even call it quote
59:06 - I called it home black banner instead of
59:09 - quote banner so I guess that works
59:13 - yeah that it works because we're not
59:14 - we're not actually using a quote in
59:16 - there before it used to be a quote and
59:18 - now it's the mission statement so this
59:20 - yeah this actually does describe what it
59:22 - is
59:24 - so I'm assuming that that's the yeah
59:27 - that's the we need okay so we're
59:31 - gonna grab and we'll need to change this
59:35 - as well because we're not this is the
59:36 - the old information that was there okay
59:45 - so I know I was going to copy copy this
59:53 - to make it easier
59:59 - I should copy I have a similar section
60:02 - on the about page so I will copy the
60:04 - section that most closely matches it I
60:13 - think it's up
60:17 - up here
60:21 - here it is
60:24 - so I'm a copy and paste but then I'll go
60:27 - through what it does mmm this is
60:39 - actually a little bit different because
60:40 - we have this h3 but it is inside the
60:46 - block how are you gonna do this
61:00 - okay I think maybe we can do this so I'm
61:04 - gonna change it up a little bit so this
61:07 - is still gonna be we're still gonna have
61:10 - this blockquote like we do here but I
61:14 - want to have
61:24 - well actually is that why they're
61:26 - automatically make it a div I think I
61:28 - figured out why it wasn't formatting
61:29 - properly I didn't realize that it
61:34 - happened so that's cool I might have
61:40 - fixed this just by this and I won't have
61:43 - to worry about it again so let's check
61:45 - this out rearrange this
61:48 - [Music]
62:00 - because this will be good if this works
62:01 - now then that'll save me a bit of time
62:18 - anybody remember Lauryn Hill from the
62:21 - 90s just just had Lauryn Hill come along
62:24 - Spotify if you'd like to follow along
62:28 - with my playlist as well check out the
62:31 - throwback Thursday playlist on Spotify
62:33 - nice alright so that was the issue with
62:36 - the formatting so awesome so I
62:42 - inadvertently figured that out as always
62:47 - this is fun alright so let's I still
62:58 - need to do it alter this just a bit well
63:01 - I mean I need to make this home and
63:08 - [Music]
63:10 - inside of the block quote we're gonna
63:15 - have an h3 and the h3
63:29 - is going to have the title wait no it
63:36 - won't because we have a title already
63:47 - we already have it site or the title is
63:49 - the home black banner okay so we can't
63:51 - do it like that
63:53 - but since WordPress already has a way to
63:58 - make things like an H tag without having
64:00 - to deal with the code then I'm okay with
64:02 - leaving it like that so I think we can
64:04 - safely just bring in everything
64:06 - including that that H tag and it should
64:10 - be pretty obvious to whoever is is
64:13 - updating it that it should work so I'm
64:17 - gonna copy this paste it in here and
64:24 - make sure see that's an h3 so it's
64:27 - already you know it's easy and WordPress
64:30 - to make that in h3 and let's check out
64:35 - the code really quickly so h3 I didn't
64:41 - realize when I copied it over it grabbed
64:43 - that I don't want that to stay that
64:45 - could cause problems
64:46 - I may have to double check and make sure
64:49 - that it didn't do it with other things
64:50 - as well okay so we'll update that so we
64:56 - can get there the correct data in there
64:59 - and then now we'll get rid of this block
65:03 - load
65:10 - and oops we need to make sure we close
65:13 - that I'm not worried about the
65:16 - formatting says we'll have once we once
65:23 - we commit this it will auto format it
65:24 - for us but it looks like something is
65:34 - making there we go
65:35 - the highlighting was just weird but I
65:37 - think that all right everything should
65:40 - work now so save that let's make sure
65:45 - okay so it's not bringing in everything
65:49 - let's check it out
66:00 - what happened did we not the update this
66:08 - maybe it was just it was probably
66:10 - keeping the that's really weird
66:22 - that was the old data right maybe it's
66:28 - just caching the old data
66:39 - let's see
66:48 - yeah for some reason that data is
66:51 - getting you still cashed maybe refresh
67:02 - maybe I need to log into WordPress again
67:13 - it looks like
67:22 - no I mean it looks fun that's all I'm
67:27 - not gonna worry about it I mean the data
67:30 - will update eventually usually it
67:37 - updates pretty quickly but anyway we'll
67:43 - check back in a few minutes the next
67:48 - thing is we can pull in some stuff from
67:50 - here and we may need to maybe to see I
68:00 - don't know if I'll need to copy and
68:05 - paste these myself or maybe Amy who
68:09 - handles the content can do this I think
68:12 - they'll probably be some additional
68:14 - things and so we'll see I'm gonna worry
68:18 - about it now but I do want to do the
68:19 - code to be able to pull these in so that
68:22 - they're not hard-coded
68:31 - okay cool um I was thinking I'd have to
68:35 - make a new component but it looks like I
68:37 - already made one so glad about that
68:47 - now I just check the live chat inside
68:49 - the matrix says the Fugees yes the the
68:51 - Fugees that's what I meant so I had I
68:53 - was listening to Lauryn Hill song but it
68:56 - probably was a Fuji song it's just
68:59 - Lauryn Hill does most of the singing
69:03 - let's see
69:22 - I just saw a couple of things in the
69:24 - live chat right now so I'm gonna check
69:26 - it really quick I'm gonna read it out
69:28 - really quick I can see if a few of you
69:34 - remember the Lauren Hill and Fuji song
69:37 - so yeah definitely good songs Jordan
69:40 - asked would it would I miss today we
69:44 - haven't really got that much done today
69:45 - we just kind of went over some of the
69:47 - fixes that I did for some things that
69:49 - were going wrong yesterday and we're
69:52 - just kind of gradually going through and
69:54 - taking a lot of this content that has
69:58 - kind of been hard-coded in and we're
70:00 - instead pulling it from the WordPress
70:02 - API because I would like as much of the
70:06 - site as possible to be editable in
70:09 - WordPress yes Ellie thanks for thanks
70:21 - for asking about the code editor it is
70:24 - Adam so I love it when people ask me
70:28 - about the editor the the theme is the
70:32 - steady theme SCT I also Ellie I don't
70:37 - think that I've seen you in the chat
70:39 - before so welcome sorry if this is not
70:42 - your first time and I just don't
70:44 - remember but welcome to the live chat
70:48 - Manny says sorry I'm late to the party
70:50 - here but did you scrape some content
70:52 - into the JSON I noticed that the quote
70:55 - had tags on the JSON object and I
70:58 - haven't seen that before
71:03 - yeah
71:04 - [Music]
71:08 - let me see
71:15 - let me make sure I know exactly what
71:17 - you're referring to let's see and I'm
71:24 - pretty sure you're referring about the
71:26 - JSON that we saw here and let's find it
71:33 - so are you talking about like the HTML
71:37 - tags that are showing up here in if that
71:41 - case if that is true then yeah we are
71:44 - we're getting this content out of
71:45 - WordPress the wordpress api and for the
71:50 - content fields you actually do get all
71:54 - the HTML that's included in those fields
71:57 - as well and it comes through with the
71:59 - json that's why we had to set it with
72:01 - dangerously set enter HTML because up
72:08 - here so that the tags actually rendered
72:11 - as HTML tags instead of just being
72:14 - printed out on the screen
72:15 - because we wouldn't want to see we
72:19 - wouldn't want to see those tags
72:20 - displayed on the screen we want them to
72:22 - be actually evaluated you know by the
72:25 - browser
72:35 - well Jeremy has got an interview
72:37 - tomorrow
72:38 - so it says thanks for the advice awesome
72:41 - really really happy for you so you'll
72:44 - have to let us know how the interview
72:45 - goes hope maybe if the interview is
72:51 - early enough tomorrow would you be able
72:53 - to let us know in tomorrow afternoon's
72:56 - livestream that would be really cool
72:58 - otherwise they can wait till next week
73:00 - but I'm excited so I want to know how it
73:03 - goes haha jonbi says one of these days
73:10 - you should just switch to a different
73:11 - editor just to mess with us actually I
73:13 - love so jahnvi I have an uncle who
73:19 - everybody calls him John be even like
73:22 - his kids call him call him John B or
73:24 - Johnny B sometimes so I I think every
73:27 - time I I see that name and say it there
73:29 - I always think of him
73:41 - all right so let's get back to this and
73:46 - we have a lot done already since we
73:48 - already have these cards made so all we
73:53 - need to do is put some data in there and
73:59 - we'll need C in this case we do we are
74:06 - gonna iterate over the column as well or
74:10 - we want to keep printing the column so
74:11 - we'll go at this point and let's see for
74:21 - a second I thought about doing a similar
74:23 - thing to what we had done on the
74:25 - resources page where you know we have
74:28 - all these different tabs and we're doing
74:30 - some pretty fancy stuff that I think it
74:32 - was fabian had submitted a pull request
74:35 - and did some cool stuff with the tabs
74:37 - and how that gets rendered out but since
74:44 - it's such a small amount of data I think
74:46 - we're fine just to actually render out
74:49 - the things for the for the tabs just
74:54 - right off the bat for both tabs so I
74:56 - think that should work and I don't think
75:01 - it warrants trying to pull in the code
75:04 - from the resources page and replicate
75:07 - what's going on there so for this one
75:11 - we're just going to just do really
75:12 - simply this for our data and we want to
75:19 - filter so everything needs to be
75:21 - filtered since we're pulling in these
75:23 - this big chunk of data that has multiple
75:25 - post types
75:26 - so the first filter we need to put on it
75:28 - is going to filter for the post type so
75:33 - we're gonna do post post type and we
75:40 - want the type that equals post
75:45 - and loose equals post and then after
75:52 - that we're going to do filter it further
75:55 - and we want the post that's gonna have
76:01 - the post a CF type of what is this one
76:11 - announcement and let me check let me
76:16 - check to make sure that that's the value
76:18 - we want yep announcement okay great and
76:25 - the other one is I think news right so
76:30 - our tights for getting announcement in
76:31 - news great
76:32 - okay so announcement and then after
76:41 - we've done that then we can map and go
76:45 - through everything so we're gonna post
76:49 - and for we're gonna grab all of this
77:01 - and on here we're gonna add a key and
77:07 - the key is gonna be our post ID whoops
77:15 - to put that in brackets if you're not
77:19 - familiar with react anything that you
77:22 - put in brackets inside your JSX which is
77:24 - basically this HTML looking stuff here
77:27 - that ends up it's JavaScript it's
77:30 - evaluated as JavaScript so that's why
77:34 - we're pulling in data and putting it in
77:36 - brackets like this okay so our title is
77:40 - going to be post oops
77:53 - title and our content
78:04 - our content is going to be post content
78:13 - rendered and actually I need to put
78:17 - render it up here too
78:18 - and the the reason these all have to be
78:22 - worded like this this is this is just
78:25 - how it comes out from the WordPress API
78:28 - and then for the URL it's going to be I
78:35 - think it's just I'm gonna double check
78:42 - that though all right so let's see
78:52 - oh we call it link
78:57 - now we didn't that's not it that would
79:01 - be the link for WordPress we don't want
79:07 - that link we want I hope we made a field
79:11 - for this because we need it otherwise
79:12 - you're gonna have to make one now
79:28 - mmm well that's no good I'm gonna
79:33 - double-check
79:46 - let's check out what it looks like in in
79:54 - WordPress so we have news if I see a
79:58 - description slug and we didn't put in
80:03 - anything for URL so let's make that post
80:07 - right now we'll make that that field no
80:14 - wait a second I remember why we didn't
80:18 - do it now okay because we want these to
80:24 - link to the actual blog post page
80:29 - originally some of them were gonna link
80:31 - to external resources but I don't think
80:35 - we want to do that now we want to we
80:37 - want this to work just like a regular
80:38 - blog so it's gonna link to a blog page
80:40 - alright so forget everything that I was
80:43 - just saying I've lost my mind for a
80:44 - second okay
80:47 - so wish that we're good so the URL then
80:50 - becomes
80:58 - let's see do we want to put this
81:08 - we don't really need the URL we need the
81:10 - slug let me check out the I want to
81:16 - check out this component just to see how
81:18 - what we're doing with that inside the
81:21 - component
81:32 - okay
81:36 - all right so then what we're gonna do is
81:38 - build the URL here and pass the complete
81:43 - URL in there because inside of here
81:45 - you know we're checking for a blank URL
81:48 - we're checking if so we're actually not
81:54 - gonna lame
82:06 - this is probably gonna be unnecessarily
82:09 - Vitt in here just for now just in case
82:11 - but it'll probably unnecessary to check
82:13 - for a blank link because the way we're
82:15 - gonna do it there's never gonna be a
82:16 - blank link but it's okay well no sense
82:24 - in like refactoring in the middle of
82:25 - this if I'm not a hundred percent sure
82:27 - that I'm not gonna use that so for this
82:32 - URL I want to make it I'm gonna use a
82:39 - template literal and I'm gonna say slash
82:43 - news and then so I can go back into
82:49 - JavaScript inside my template literal we
82:52 - need to put a dollar sign and then curly
82:55 - brackets and so now we can put
82:57 - JavaScript in and then I'm gonna say
82:59 - post slug and that's gonna put together
83:07 - that that URL will work because we're
83:13 - using parameterised routing for anything
83:15 - that's on the route of news so it'll
83:21 - just pass the slug along to our template
83:24 - for news which is our single news page
83:27 - template and then it'll use that here it
83:32 - will pass it along as ID so this is
83:35 - really the slug it will use the slug
83:36 - here to make the API call to get just
83:38 - the data that it needs for that
83:41 - particular post so we're good
83:44 - alright so we should be able to save
83:47 - that and I can delete the rest of these
83:53 - and I got a Hootie and the Blowfish is
84:01 - playing right now I totally forgot about
84:04 - them I used to really like Hootie and
84:07 - the Blowfish when I was in grade school
84:11 - we can also copy this now and with only
84:15 - one change use it down here
84:20 - and all what i have to change is this
84:24 - filter and then we can get rid of this
84:32 - and let's save it and refresh restart my
84:41 - search
84:46 - it's getting worse it used to be that I
84:48 - could code for a while without having to
84:50 - restart my dev server and now it's like
84:52 - very frequently oh man my timer ran out
84:55 - I didn't even notice it all right well I
84:57 - guess I'll start the showed up again
84:59 - with the break let's go down here
85:01 - whoa I'll shoot I had thought about that
85:04 - and then I forgot so this I'm actually
85:08 - kind of glad this has happened so this
85:09 - is what happens if you don't dangerous
85:12 - yet enter HTML when you're grabbing
85:13 - stuff from WordPress content the tags
85:17 - actually show up so you can see them
85:20 - there and you can see here the tags are
85:23 - showing up the good thing is what we did
85:25 - worked and it is in fact filtering
85:28 - things into the right spot and also good
85:33 - news is we know exactly how to fix this
85:35 - so let's do that now so we need to go
85:37 - into our text card before since we were
85:41 - manually typing in a string of what we
85:45 - wanted these to be I had never bothered
85:48 - with setting the inner HTML and probably
85:52 - lazily because I always knew this was
85:54 - eventually gonna be populated with other
85:55 - data so I should have just done it
85:57 - before but now we can just grab I'll
86:03 - just grab this I don't even have to type
86:04 - it out again
86:05 - so for the title and the description we
86:10 - want to do this for both of them so I'm
86:12 - gonna put this on the title and on the
86:14 - description and we're gonna change this
86:21 - to this drops title and we're gonna
86:29 - change
86:31 - this one - this crops do we call it
86:38 - content
86:39 - I just want to double-check yes we did
86:41 - call it content here this props content
86:46 - okay now we can remove this okay we can
86:51 - remove this and let's save it just to
86:55 - make sure it works
86:56 - whoa
87:03 - all right this is I forgot that okay so
87:09 - here's what's happening here in this
87:12 - post I went to pages sorry
87:19 - in this post there's an image I had done
87:24 - this earlier when I was meeting with
87:26 - with Amy who does the content just to
87:28 - show her how to put an image in and I've
87:30 - forgotten about it but what we want to
87:32 - do is we actually don't want that image
87:34 - to show up so here's what I think I
87:38 - think we only want the excerpt to show
87:40 - up here we don't want the full text
87:42 - because it could be really big like this
87:46 - already extends out so let's let's
87:48 - change this so what we want to do we
87:51 - only have to change it here post excerpt
88:01 - and now let's check out
88:09 - wait a second let me check the check
88:15 - this
88:19 - I didn't think the excerpt kept images
88:23 - Oh actually no I don't think I want to
88:28 - keep the excerpt because it adds in this
88:30 - more this more link I don't want that
88:33 - and I know I can change this and the
88:35 - function is a PHP file but I don't want
88:38 - to go through all that so all right I'm
88:47 - gonna go since I had already used up
88:48 - most of my five minutes that I was gonna
88:50 - spend on a live chat I'm gonna go to
88:52 - lunch at now that will give us a minute
88:54 - to think about the best way to address
88:55 - this basically the problem is I don't
88:59 - have enough space here here to put
89:03 - everything so I need a way to just get
89:05 - some of the data also I need to strip
89:08 - out any images because I don't want
89:10 - images in here
89:10 - the simplest way seemed to be to get the
89:13 - excerpt from WordPress instead of the
89:16 - entire content but that's not gonna work
89:18 - because of the more tag so potentially I
89:21 - could use that and then just strip out
89:23 - the more tag either on this end with
89:27 - JavaScript or on the wordpress end with
89:29 - PHP so I'm gonna go back to the live
89:33 - chat and talk for a little bit with you
89:36 - all when we can all think about what the
89:38 - best way to do that is
89:52 - okay I did get a Sarah asked if I'd
89:55 - tried Visual Studio code yeah I have
89:58 - tried Visual Studio code I was using it
90:03 - actually used it on some of my earliest
90:05 - live streams so the ones I did on my own
90:07 - channel before I got invited to stream
90:10 - for free code camp I was using visual
90:13 - studio code on some of those so if you
90:15 - actually want to see me using Visual
90:16 - Studio code go check out some of my my
90:19 - first live streams the I will warn you
90:24 - though the first couple of streams are a
90:26 - little bit rough because the quality I
90:29 - didn't I didn't really have the hang of
90:32 - using OBS yet to do my streaming so the
90:36 - quality is not great and there were some
90:39 - streams where I had no one watching so
90:41 - it's just me talking no interaction with
90:43 - anyone but you will get to see me use
90:47 - Visual Studio code so I think the
90:49 - project I'll be working on after I
90:51 - switched from this one which will be
90:53 - like at the end of next week I think I'm
90:56 - gonna switch back to the project that
90:57 - was working on so I'll probably be
90:59 - switching back to Visual Studio code the
91:01 - reason I use Visual Studio code for that
91:03 - project is because a lot of it is
91:05 - written in c-sharp and when I tried to
91:08 - load c-sharp and Adam it didn't
91:10 - automatically highlight things for me
91:11 - but when I loaded it in Visual Studio
91:13 - code it did highlight things really
91:15 - nicely so instead of getting the right
91:18 - plug-in for Adam I just used Visual
91:20 - Studio code because that was that was
91:22 - faster and I had been looking for an
91:25 - excuse to try it out anyway and so it
91:29 - was good I I liked it I'm not ready to
91:32 - switch from Adam but I do like it
91:44 - a new path says hi hey how's it going
91:48 - Ali says hi Sabir says hi hey everyone
91:51 - thanks for joining in wow this would
91:54 - already it's already 6 o'clock Wow hey I
91:59 - just checked my phone so a man at 6
92:01 - o'clock I wonder for my wife's tried to
92:03 - call me she did not try to call me but
92:06 - she did ask me in the text do you know
92:09 - what happened to the sweet Italian
92:11 - sausages and no I don't know what
92:14 - happened to them I hope the dog didn't
92:16 - eat them we recently got a dog against
92:24 - my against my will
92:27 - we got a dog and basically I didn't want
92:34 - a dog because there are a lot of work
92:35 - and I knew that I would probably be
92:38 - doing a lot of the work and I knew that
92:40 - I would fall in love with the dog and
92:43 - there was a good chance that we wouldn't
92:45 - be able to keep the dog because the last
92:46 - time my wife wanted a dog it didn't get
92:50 - along with the kids and so we had to get
92:51 - rid of it it broke my heart so I didn't
92:53 - want my heart broken again but she
92:55 - brought on this dog and the dog loves me
92:57 - sorry for the little tangent but there
92:59 - was no questions in the live chat so I
93:01 - thought I'd just say it so the dog loves
93:04 - me and wants to be around me all the
93:06 - time and the dog hated my wife which was
93:12 - kind of funny because she's the one that
93:14 - really wanted a dog so the dog I mean
93:17 - literally that that if the dog was
93:19 - eating and my wife walked into the room
93:22 - the dog would leave the room wait for my
93:24 - wife to leave and then come back in and
93:26 - resume eating so I did feel bad for my
93:30 - wife because she really wanted that dog
93:31 - so the dog in my wife now get along but
93:34 - now my wife thinks that she's allergic
93:36 - to the dog so I think we're gonna end up
93:40 - getting rid of the dog I feel really bad
93:43 - for the dog because it just changed
93:45 - homes to us and now it's gonna change
93:47 - again and so anyway and then I'm gonna
93:50 - miss the dog so anyway the whole reason
93:56 - I even get onto that is
93:58 - the dog's been eating food off the table
94:00 - so if one of the kids has like a
94:01 - hamburger or something and leaves it on
94:03 - the table and goes in the other room
94:04 - when they come back in the room the
94:07 - hamburger is missing and the plate is
94:09 - clean it's because the dog eats eats all
94:13 - their stuff so now I'm gonna check the
94:19 - live chat really quick and then I'll get
94:20 - back to to what we were doing we'll
94:22 - figure out a solution to our little
94:24 - problem as youngbae said yeah blame it
94:29 - on the dog Jesse it's true I didn't he I
94:31 - only ate one sausage I didn't eat all of
94:34 - them
94:42 - Wow Sebastian scissors after midnight
94:46 - where you were you from Sebastian you
94:49 - probably told me before and I just don't
94:50 - remember
94:57 - alright okay I did have some other
94:59 - questions come in the live chat while I
95:00 - was telling a story about my dog
95:03 - so Jambi yes how long did it take you to
95:05 - learn react and basically anything I
95:12 - really didn't pay that much attention to
95:15 - react until last May so I went to a
95:19 - conference last May and everybody was
95:21 - talking about react and so that's what I
95:23 - really like seriously started thinking
95:25 - like that I need to learn about react
95:26 - because it looks cool I had like I had
95:30 - heard of react before then but my
95:32 - attitude was kind of like oh man another
95:34 - JavaScript framework like well we'll see
95:36 - we'll see if this one is sticks around
95:40 - you know because there's so many
95:41 - frameworks right so basically it's been
95:46 - about a year I haven't I didn't really
95:50 - try to build anything in react until
95:55 - probably like January or May so it
96:03 - wasn't until this year that I actually
96:05 - tried to build something in react I had
96:08 - done some tutorials in react before so I
96:10 - had watched some video tutorials I did
96:12 - the Khan Academy a tutorial for react
96:15 - but I hadn't really successfully built
96:18 - anything until until this this year so
96:24 - sometime in in the early months of 2017
96:29 - I started like seriously starting to
96:33 - build things and learn more about react
96:35 - so I the first react site that I ever
96:37 - launched like for a client I launched it
96:41 - on April 1st of 2017 so that was my
96:46 - first successful site and so it hasn't
96:51 - really been that long it's kind of
96:54 - surprising now that I think about it
96:56 - that I've I'm building site so when I
97:01 - say like that I really had consider
97:03 - myself to be very new and still learning
97:05 - react like really it hasn't
97:07 - that long so I'm definitely not an
97:10 - expert at it
97:12 - Oh Jeremy's got a see you later Jeremy
97:15 - Jeremy says it's got to go
97:18 - thanks for the videos I'll let you know
97:20 - how my interview goes tomorrow if I
97:21 - catch it all right awesome
97:22 - yeah definitely want to hear about the
97:24 - interview good luck with that and yeah
97:27 - and thanks thanks for watching
97:29 - let me check I'm going to take a few
97:32 - more questions
97:34 - well Sebastian said you can add an
97:36 - excerpt field in WordPress so whoever
97:38 - adds the post can add a little excerpt
97:40 - with no image and then use the real post
97:43 - for the blog post yeah I can oh I'm
97:48 - gonna think about that I got to think
97:50 - I'm not sure if I want I can see pros
97:57 - and cons to that so definitely it would
98:00 - be cool for the content editors to be
98:05 - able to say exactly what they won on the
98:07 - front but it would also be a little bit
98:11 - of extra work I guess they could just
98:15 - copy and paste like the first paragraph
98:18 - if they really wanted to
98:22 - so we'll see maybe maybe although that
98:24 - is I kind of like that I do you know and
98:26 - I think about it more that might be the
98:28 - best solution here
98:37 - sir-sir guala says it's five where I'm
98:40 - located cool does that mean like 5:00
98:42 - a.m. or 5:00 p.m. if it's 5 p.m. then
98:49 - you're probably pretty close to my
98:50 - timezone if it's 5 a.m. then you you're
98:55 - probably on the other side of the world
98:56 - I encourage says it's 3:30 5:00 a.m.
99:02 - here in India okay cool yeah I mean I
99:04 - usually remember what time it is in
99:06 - India because I've had who is it Rohan
99:10 - always tells me what time it is in India
99:12 - so Rohan must have been asleep for this
99:15 - one usually he stays up to like 2:00
99:17 - a.m. India time and I don't know how he
99:24 - does it and on couch how are you up at
99:27 - 3:35 a.m. watching this I'm glad I'm
99:31 - glad you're watching this thanks for
99:34 - watching but that's crazy all right
99:42 - Sebastian has a cat sitting on his lap
99:47 - right at the moment it's really hot in
99:49 - the house and the hairy cat is not
99:51 - helping yeah is it you know like pets
99:54 - pets and kids always want to like be
99:57 - right next to you when it's hot and like
100:00 - my son my oldest son Raphael like when I
100:04 - go to put him to sleep at night like
100:06 - he'll cuddle up next to me and we'll
100:08 - read a book or something and he'll say
100:11 - like oh I'm so hot and I'm like dude
100:13 - just like you're you're like on top of
100:15 - me you know you can't just scoot over a
100:18 - little bit it's not that I don't you
100:19 - know I don't want to cuddle with him but
100:22 - it's like doesn't help if the body heat
100:25 - is being shared okay Sebastian you're
100:29 - Spain all right awesome
100:39 - oh it's about Sebastian Asif if I saw
100:43 - what he said about what I asked yeah uh
100:45 - obviously I saw that now so I think that
100:49 - is a good idea and I'm probably gonna go
100:51 - with that dyad asks what do you think
100:55 - about the UJS I haven't used UJ s and I
100:59 - haven't learned enough about it to have
101:01 - a good opinion on it so I'm not gonna
101:03 - try to give you an answer that I would
101:05 - just make up what I will say is that
101:08 - I've seen a lot of people talk about it
101:11 - on Twitter so I mean it seems legit just
101:15 - from like the amount of buzz this
101:17 - getting and amount of hype on Twitter
101:19 - and the people that are like legitimate
101:21 - programmers who are using it and saying
101:24 - it's good so I can't say firsthand
101:26 - anything about it but it does seem like
101:28 - it's a legitimate alternative framework
101:37 - Andrew said I started at work to make an
101:40 - admin dashboard and react and react
101:42 - router and fell in love with it that's
101:45 - awesome
101:46 - I'd like to see that I don't know if
101:48 - you're able to share that share a coder
101:51 - there any anything with that or a link
101:53 - but that would be really cool to see
101:54 - Andrew John B says I gotta head out
101:57 - myself to hope you all have a good day
101:59 - have a good day Jesse and see you again
102:00 - sometime soon
102:01 - all right see you John B probably
102:04 - already left so I didn't read that fast
102:05 - enough but in case you're still here see
102:07 - you thanks for joining and contributing
102:11 - in a live chat really appreciate that on
102:15 - couche says I just came in what's the
102:17 - problem we were having okay so here's
102:19 - the problem he came in so basically you
102:20 - can see on the screen it's pulling in
102:24 - I'm pulling in some data but it's
102:29 - pulling in like an image and stuff and I
102:31 - don't want that I basically just want a
102:33 - little bit of text like the first bit of
102:34 - text so I think the solution we're gonna
102:36 - do is I'm gonna make another field for
102:39 - this post
102:40 - so I'll have another field probably up
102:43 - here down here somewhere
102:44 - that's just going to be for the the
102:47 - excerpt right so the content editor is
102:50 - going to type in just a little bit and
102:52 - that's
102:52 - here here and then the real content will
102:55 - appear after you click it will take you
102:57 - to another page and show it all Alberto
103:03 - says without giving it too much thought
103:04 - add a style for the card image to
103:07 - display none yeah actually that's a
103:10 - really good idea that would that would
103:11 - solve the image thing it still wouldn't
103:14 - solve the problem of trying to pool like
103:16 - all the the content but that's a really
103:22 - good idea for like a simple fix okay let
103:32 - me get back to this now that we've we've
103:34 - kind of decided on a solution let's do
103:38 - this I'm gonna make I know that there's
103:39 - an excerpt field that you can add that's
103:42 - like kind of by default comes in
103:44 - WordPress but I'm not going to use that
103:45 - one because I don't know I don't think
103:49 - that'll automatically strip out the tags
103:51 - and I want all the tags stripped out for
103:54 - this part because I don't want people
103:56 - putting like an unordered list or
103:58 - something crazy in here that's gonna
103:59 - throw off my formatting so I'm gonna use
104:02 - the custom fields plug-in to make a
104:05 - field I already have the posts field and
104:11 - I'm just gonna add excerpt and the other
104:18 - cool thing I can do with this is that I
104:19 - can put explanatory text so let me make
104:23 - this a text area and I can also limit
104:26 - the characters so let me think how many
104:29 - characters would probably fit there
104:31 - there's anybody good with estimating
104:33 - characters so I wanted to fill up I mean
104:36 - it can go all the way down to here but I
104:38 - don't want it any any more so I wonder
104:40 - if I have all right
104:51 - this is about 30 characters across okay
104:59 - so 300 I'm gonna set a three hundred
105:01 - character limit because it's about 30
105:03 - characters across and I'm pretty sure I
105:05 - could get at least ten lines on here so
105:07 - 30 or 300 character limit
105:11 - and for the formatting I'm gonna say no
105:17 - formatting so it's not gonna pull in any
105:19 - of the HTML tags for the instructions
105:23 - I'm gonna say
105:34 - give a little bit of instruction and
105:37 - it's just going to be required yes this
105:40 - will be required we need this otherwise
105:42 - we'll get nothing on here and that
105:44 - that'll be no good so not all the posts
105:47 - will appear here I'm just gonna grab the
105:49 - newest post so I won't actually need
105:53 - this for all of them but at some point
105:54 - probably every post will appear here
105:56 - unless unless like more than four posts
106:00 - get added all at the same time all right
106:04 - I'm gonna double check make sure I
106:06 - filled everything in and all right that
106:10 - looks good so let's update and I'm gonna
106:15 - go back to posts and I'm just gonna fill
106:18 - in some of this data so we have
106:19 - something excerpt and I'm gonna grab
106:23 - some lorem ipsum text or maybe I use
106:30 - bacon if some yesterday of the day
106:32 - before
106:34 - what's your favorite lorem ipsum
106:36 - generator I know I've seen a generator
106:40 - for samuel l.jackson it's just like
106:44 - Samuel Epson we could try to use that
106:48 - there's like a
106:54 - there's a generator that uses all like
107:00 - the bad language versions of it and then
107:02 - I think there's another one that just
107:03 - has the quotes that that don't have bad
107:10 - language in it so I think we'll use the
107:13 - stuff without the bad language
107:29 - I
107:37 - I gotta read the quotes first since I'm
107:40 - not you know this is a site for the
107:41 - University I sure don't put it anything
107:43 - crazy up here but this is a quote I
107:45 - think from the movie unbreakable I
107:50 - believe so
107:55 - this will this should work I do want to
107:58 - test out
108:00 - okay so cool so this did work so we have
108:03 - we stopped at 300 characters so that
108:08 - would definitely work out to give us an
108:10 - idea of how much the 300 characters are
108:12 - so let me update this and I need to
108:18 - update our code because we're grabbing
108:23 - the excerpts from the ACF field now and
108:28 - we might end up getting an error I'm
108:32 - just going to try but we'll probably end
108:33 - up getting an error because this field
108:35 - is not going to exist for the some of
108:37 - the posts right now we save not actually
108:45 - safe I just need to restart the dev
108:48 - server
109:06 - hmm
109:12 - well
109:16 - actually this is odd we're still if you
109:18 - notice like this is still the old data
109:21 - and nothing is nothing is updating I
109:31 - don't like that that's really weird
109:40 - wow this is so I haven't blocked this
109:43 - off so that it doesn't display anything
109:45 - this is what the site would look like
109:47 - it's not too bad but it's still showing
109:53 - okay now that is the right data that is
109:56 - still showing why is it not pulling in
110:00 - what we just did right content imposed a
110:03 - CFX oh yeah what's going on
110:31 - that's weird
110:43 - oops I was looking for content I meant
110:45 - excerpt
110:53 - here we go
110:55 - ACF excerpts all right so it's here we
111:01 - see it here
111:15 - okay so what's going on here
111:36 - yeah I'm thinking maybe it is the cash
111:39 - so Sebastian just said cash but the
111:42 - other thing is like I'm not there
111:46 - shouldn't be any cash when I'm running
111:48 - the dev server so I have it set so that
111:53 - the the cash is like one second or
111:56 - something so that shouldn't be the issue
111:57 - and then I haven't set up a cash for the
112:03 - WordPress API and obviously like we're
112:06 - getting the new data in the API as well
112:22 - actually I want to add a new post to
112:36 - okay
112:46 - so you check that out so we got this so
112:49 - it's not an API caching thing but
112:53 - potentially like I guess it could be
112:56 - trying to pull in most ACS excellent
113:04 - are we caching
113:16 - you check my server Dutch AS VAL to make
113:20 - sure i'm not cashing anyone so yeah so
113:26 - it should be yeah so the cache time it
113:34 - looks like I've set it to 100
113:36 - milliseconds
114:00 - yeah so that that looks like it's set up
114:02 - fine
114:11 - okay so let's open up getting some
114:14 - requests to open up dev tools let's see
114:19 - I think I have it automatically set to
114:22 - disable the cache if dev tools are open
114:31 - so let's see if that fixed it just from
114:36 - being open no but it did freeze my desk
114:42 - for her again
114:45 - alright so we'll start that up again
114:46 - with dev tools open
114:56 - this is one of those unexpected
114:57 - slowdowns that I was worried about let
115:05 - me make sure that I have the cash
115:10 - disabled
115:22 - I can't remember where that what that is
115:31 - anybody remember where that option is in
115:34 - dev tools
115:43 - should I read through all the ones make
115:45 - sure I'm not missing it
116:01 - maybe it's somewhere else let me check
116:03 - oh that's in the network tab okay sorry
116:07 - I wasn't looking over there yeah okay
116:12 - cool I did have disabled cash checks I
116:15 - thought I always did keep that off
116:31 - it's such a huge here's what's weird to
116:35 - me so we've definitely now I know what
116:39 - happened man if you haven't already
116:43 - figured it out oh I feel so silly now
116:49 - okay so we only changed it here right
116:54 - our this is behaving exactly as we told
116:59 - it to behave because it's still being
117:01 - told to pull the content rendered for
117:05 - the announcements oh man
117:10 - see this there we go that's what we need
117:20 - all right that's it and that's pretty
117:24 - much perfect as far as the length goes
117:31 - we could increase it a bit
117:39 - so I can maybe go like three owner we
117:44 - could probably fit another line in there
117:45 - I don't want it to look too crowded at
117:47 - the bottom so maybe I can go like two
117:50 - 320 characters who ever really wanted to
118:02 - but I don't think that's a big deal
118:04 - we'll see if that's really something
118:07 - that's necessary I can increase it a bit
118:09 - okay so so this works and actually the
118:14 - cool thing is I wasn't getting errors I
118:16 - was I was thinking I may get an error
118:18 - because that field wouldn't exist at all
118:20 - in ACF but it seems like we're not
118:24 - getting the error at least it's not
118:30 - causing it man these things are coming
118:34 - from looks like we're not giving
118:43 - something in it a key somewhere so we
118:49 - need to figure out what's not getting
118:50 - the key and they say Oh since you won 34
118:53 - in the blockquote that's weird because
118:57 - we're we're only pulling one thing maybe
119:00 - it still wants a key even though it's
119:02 - one thing so we give that a key these
119:04 - are caused by the YouTube embed so the
119:12 - YouTube embed seems to be working so I
119:14 - guess I'm not gonna worry about these is
119:16 - there any special thing that needs to
119:19 - happen with YouTube embeds and react
119:20 - that's gonna mess up the site if so you
119:24 - know about it
119:25 - please let me know otherwise I'll just
119:28 - kind of let it go and make sure that I
119:33 - test out that homepage on different
119:36 - browsers so let's put in the key and
119:42 - wish do like we've been doing and say
119:45 - post id loose post id
119:55 - and we can check to make sure I guess I
120:02 - didn't refresh
120:08 - great okay so we don't have that error
120:11 - anymore oh so let's I'm just going to go
120:16 - ahead so we've been working on this for
120:18 - a while and how long were you doing this
120:20 - I have at least done probably four
120:28 - Pomodoro sessions so far I've been
120:31 - streaming for what like two hours I want
120:35 - to say at least three or four I'm gonna
120:37 - say I've done three more sessions so I'm
120:40 - gonna bump that up to six because I have
120:43 - done some a little bit of talking so
120:45 - three sessions I'm glad that I estimated
120:49 - it at 13 because I'll probably need most
120:53 - of that time although we as we run into
120:57 - and figure out you know some of these
121:00 - issues it'll make each successive page a
121:03 - bit easier but anyway a home page just
121:07 - looking at looking decent now so this is
121:10 - everything that we wanted to do for the
121:11 - home page well with the exception of
121:13 - this what the heck is going on with this
121:19 - let's double check let's check this
121:22 - again for some reason
121:35 - oh you know what why is this a quote
121:42 - let's change this so I think I put
121:52 - I think I took out the normal editor and
121:54 - I put in this custom field here and
121:56 - that's probably what's messing things up
121:58 - because the original data probably had
122:02 - this in it and nothing else
122:09 - yeah so that's what's go into our custom
122:12 - fields and yep home barriner fields and
122:19 - we had the quote in alright so let's
122:22 - let's just get rid of that because I
122:24 - don't think we need yeah we don't need
122:30 - that this should work without it better
122:35 - to just simplify it if we don't need it
122:38 - now let's go back to the pages we'll see
122:41 - what's going on
122:42 - and if I'm correct yep there we go so
122:47 - once again it's doing exactly what we
122:51 - told it to do I was just confused about
122:53 - what I was telling it to do so let me
122:56 - grab
123:03 - what I have it I still have the
123:06 - development server open which does have
123:09 - the text that I want so I'll grab it
123:11 - from there here and then let's make sure
123:21 - yeah I want to get rid of that data JSX
123:25 - cuz that'll mess things up and update
123:31 - now we'll be able to see what it really
123:33 - looks like and if it's it's gonna look
123:40 - how we want it to look
123:51 - man this dev server is like stopping so
123:54 - often it might be faster to just not
123:56 - have hot module reloading and manually
123:58 - refresh the page alright cool so this is
124:02 - working this is how we wanted it to look
124:06 - awesome
124:12 - so that's the home page done and I
124:17 - forgot to start up my my timer again
124:21 - no let's I'm gonna commit this
124:32 - check out the status okay so we've
124:35 - edited what do we do the about I don't
124:39 - remember what we did to the about page
124:41 - it's probably just some sort of Auto
124:43 - formatting thing that that happened so
124:50 - I'm not gonna worry about it Oh
125:01 - [Music]
125:27 - enough to remember to push all these
125:29 - changes to the the dev server so you all
125:34 - can see this I'll try to remember to do
125:36 - that before I leave today okay so we've
125:44 - got the home page getting the data that
125:47 - we want from the API I'm gonna check the
125:49 - live chat and then I'm have to decide
125:53 - whether I want to keep working or go
125:56 - home since it's after 6:30 p.m. my time
126:03 - so it's definitely beyond the point at
126:06 - which I normally go home I've been here
126:08 - since 9:30 a.m. and I worked through my
126:12 - lunch break alright so I'm gonna scroll
126:20 - up a bit so you see what I missed
126:48 - okay Sara showed there's a Bible Epsom
126:52 - Oh seriously that that would actually be
126:55 - perfect for this site I'm gonna look
126:58 - that up on my other screen that would be
127:01 - way more appropriate than Samuel Jackson
127:03 - Epsom for this site like I wouldn't mind
127:05 - it for like a side project but oh really
127:11 - cool awesome
127:18 - all right cool I'm definitely gonna use
127:21 - the Bible if some now when I need lorem
127:24 - ipsum text the rest of the site I think
127:26 - the people who are in charge of
127:29 - catechetical Institute would appreciate
127:31 - that much more than the samuel l.jackson
127:33 - or even the bacon ipsum as awesome as
127:36 - that is okay it looks like some of you
127:42 - were asking about like to see things in
127:44 - dev tools and stuff but I think that was
127:49 - in reference to the problem we're having
127:50 - and sorted that all out it was basically
127:53 - just my fault and not changing what I
127:56 - needed to change so birdperson asked and
128:02 - this was maybe 20 minutes ago so sorry
128:05 - for getting back to you a little later
128:09 - but very person as Jesse can you advise
128:12 - starting point to study react what you
128:15 - read watch Thanks so my advice would be
128:21 - to watch just to get an idea of like the
128:26 - the whole philosophy behind react
128:29 - there's some videos you can watch from
128:32 - like the react conf like Facebook's
128:35 - react conference what do they call is it
128:39 - just called react conf I can't remember
128:41 - now but if you check out the react like
128:47 - the Facebook developers YouTube or
128:49 - something I can't remember what it is
128:50 - now what the YouTube channel is for sure
128:52 - but check out like some of the keynote
128:56 - addresses where they explain the
128:59 - reasoning behind it that's kind of cool
129:00 - you don't need to know that to know
129:01 - react but it's kind of cool to get in
129:03 - the mindset of like why why even make
129:07 - another framework you know what's this
129:08 - for so that's kind of cool some of the
129:12 - talks will be like way over your head
129:13 - some of the socks are still over my head
129:16 - so you know probably don't need to watch
129:19 - them all there's some stuff about react
129:22 - on will stern has a YouTube channel
129:26 - called learn code
129:29 - Academy I think that's that's what is
129:31 - called so he has some react stuff that's
129:34 - good the videos are a little bit older
129:36 - but they still work for an introduction
129:39 - to react the react documentation on like
129:43 - the official react website is pretty
129:45 - good code Academy has like an in-browser
129:49 - react tutorial that you can go through
129:51 - this kind of nice because you don't need
129:53 - to know how to set up any development
129:54 - environments so that will be helpful and
129:59 - I think what else free code camp I
130:04 - haven't checked out the react section in
130:07 - a while I'm not sure that the react
130:09 - section is actually finished for like
130:12 - the the official courses right now the
130:16 - official challenges but the beta version
130:18 - of the challenges I think has more react
130:21 - stuff in it I I haven't checked that in
130:26 - a while so I can't say for sure so that
130:29 - those resources are what I would
130:31 - probably check out I think you could
130:35 - probably get some idea of what's going
130:38 - on and react from some of my past
130:39 - streams but my streams aren't exactly
130:42 - like a tutorial so that might be useful
130:46 - like if you were working on something
130:47 - else and just wanted to play it in the
130:49 - background and just like watch when
130:51 - something was happening that was useful
130:53 - that might be it might be helpful to you
130:57 - otherwise like it wouldn't be really
131:00 - efficient to try to watch my streams to
131:02 - actually learn anything because there's
131:05 - so much other stuff going on that it's
131:08 - not focused enough so you'll you will
131:10 - probably learn stuff but it'll be all
131:13 - over the place most of the time and the
131:16 - streams are brief can be really long so
131:18 - anyway I hope at least some of those
131:21 - resources are helpful to you and all
131:27 - right also I recommend starting out with
131:29 - something like an XJS or create react
131:32 - app just to help you get started
131:34 - building something oh also too if if you
131:38 - if you have money to spend on trying
131:42 - to learn react Udacity has a good react
131:45 - course they just started and I'm I'm
131:46 - taking the course right now and I've
131:48 - been impressed with it so far but the
131:49 - course is 500 dollars like so like in US
131:52 - dollars it's 500 dollars
131:54 - so not sure you know how much you want
131:57 - to spend on react but that that course
132:00 - has been good so far from me
132:09 - let's see okay it looks like Andrew sent
132:14 - an image I'm assuming this is of the
132:18 - admin panel that you made in react we'll
132:21 - find out in a second I'm going to open
132:22 - up on my other screen here and just say
132:26 - oops I say I think I put left this space
132:36 - in there
132:36 - there we go that's weird
132:57 - so anyway Andrew I tried to check out
132:59 - that image and it's it's giving me the
133:04 - error the error page for imager so Sara
133:14 - said in response to bird person's
133:16 - question about react the try level up
133:18 - tux or level up I'm not sure how you
133:21 - pronounce it it's level up to UTS which
133:24 - is supposed to be short for tutorials
133:26 - but I always look at it and want to say
133:29 - level up tuts
133:30 - and so I'm not sure how are you supposed
133:33 - to pronounce it yeah okay thanks
133:38 - everyone for trying to try to help out
133:43 - with the air I was having I can see now
133:45 - on the chat that you were all kind of
133:46 - asking about it but sorry about the
133:49 - silly mistake on my part
134:07 - okay so Patrick had a link that looks
134:09 - like it's gonna be useful so I'm gonna
134:11 - open this on my other screen real quick
134:13 - and if maybe I'll pull it over under my
134:16 - main screen so I get why they don't let
134:24 - you put links in the live chat but it
134:26 - ends up being annoying to have to copy
134:29 - and paste them and then take out the
134:30 - spaces and stuff so anyway this is the
134:34 - resource that patrick has just put in
134:38 - the live chat for learning react so this
134:44 - is the react redux length on github so
134:52 - it looks like it has a lot of nice stuff
134:55 - for getting started tutorials so nice
135:01 - that's that's this looks really good
135:03 - Patrick so thanks for this so this
135:06 - should be helpful to anyone it looks
135:10 - like to anyone starting out or at any
135:13 - level of trying to learn react this is
135:15 - really cool I'm definitely gonna star
135:18 - this hey I already started cool does
135:25 - that ever happen anyone else you find
135:27 - this really awesome github repo and then
135:29 - you go to start and you realize that
135:31 - you've already started at some point I
135:33 - need to go back and look through this
135:35 - stuff I've starred I'm sure I'll find
135:38 - useful stuff there that I've completely
135:40 - forgotten about but this one looks good
135:42 - it looks like it's it's kept up to date
135:44 - like I mean look this two days ago it
135:48 - was updated so that's cool sometimes you
135:50 - see nice lists like this but they're a
135:52 - little outdated but this one is kept up
135:54 - so thanks Patrick
136:08 - okay Sara also says for in terms of
136:11 - react courses also if you don't mind
136:15 - paying try West boss calm so yeah I've
136:20 - never taken any courses from there I've
136:22 - seen maybe on Twitter i'm not i don't
136:26 - remember where I've seen it maybe an
136:28 - advertisement or something for that so
136:29 - but I can't really say personally
136:32 - anything about it because I haven't
136:34 - haven't taken any any courses okay
136:39 - Sebastian says if you use map you need a
136:42 - key so since I used earlier I was
136:46 - getting the air that I needed a key but
136:49 - it was even it was on this block quote
136:50 - and I'm only pulling one thing for the
136:52 - block but quote but since I was using
136:55 - map I still needed the key which that
136:58 - makes sense I don't mind putting the key
137:00 - on there that will help me get used to
137:02 - putting the key in there all the time
137:04 - which I frequently forget to do so maybe
137:06 - if I make myself do it enough times I'll
137:09 - remember it
137:20 - Sebastien says by the way you get the
137:22 - solution to the warning in the warning
137:24 - itself yeah I know usually react is
137:28 - really good about providing really
137:31 - useful warnings
137:39 - thanks you wanna check that out now and
137:41 - actually didn't read this frameborder oh
137:44 - that's why thanks for saying that
137:47 - Sebastian because now I realized that I
137:51 - should have just read this oh man okay
137:57 - so let's just fix this right now I feel
138:01 - so so silly right now that I didn't just
138:04 - take three seconds to actually read that
138:06 - warning so basically in react it wants
138:16 - me to camelcase this let me see what's
138:21 - this when it wants allowfullscreen okay
138:23 - wants me to camelcase these I gotten
138:25 - lazy with this stuff because I have a
138:29 - NPM module that actually lets me use
138:32 - like class instead of class name and
138:34 - things like that but I guess it doesn't
138:36 - convert stuff like this let's see yeah
138:47 - it looks like I think this is new stuff
138:49 - here so it looks like it went away I I
138:52 - do want to double check just want to see
138:54 - that nice clean clean screen there yeah
139:00 - all right check it out now we only have
139:02 - I should get rid of this console log and
139:08 - this console ugh
139:14 - I'm gonna do that right now cuz
139:17 - otherwise I'll forget I think that's in
139:21 - analytic that's both in the analytics
139:23 - okay so I don't need this and I don't
139:26 - need this
139:42 - that now we're those the heirs all right
139:46 - those are the areas that I get when my
139:51 - my dev server fails all right so next
139:54 - time I see those errors I'm not just
139:55 - gonna get rid of them actually gonna
139:57 - read them and try to figure out what is
139:58 - going on but at least I won't it won't
140:04 - be quite so cluttered now that I've
140:06 - gotten rid of some of the logs okay
140:14 - Patrick says +14 west boss he's awesome
140:18 - okay so maybe that that resources we got
140:23 - two people in the live chat now
140:24 - recommending that resource so maybe I'll
140:28 - have to check it out I don't have time
140:30 - to take on another course right now
140:32 - since I'm already doing one well I'm
140:34 - already doing free code camp and Udacity
140:37 - on top of my other work and taking care
140:41 - of all my kids so maybe when I finish up
140:45 - with one of the things then I can do
140:47 - check out west boss how's the pricing on
140:51 - that is it like really expensive or you
140:54 - know compared to a lot of other courses
141:00 - okay Andrews asking about the Pomodoro
141:03 - Technique and the stuff in Trello I
141:05 - explained it like in more depth early in
141:07 - the stream so if you can check out the
141:09 - recording like you'll get a better
141:11 - explanation but basically the numbers in
141:14 - Trello or the number of Pomodoro
141:15 - sessions that each task takes so a
141:20 - Pomodoro session is 25 minutes so every
141:23 - 25 minutes I take a five-minute break
141:25 - after four sessions I take a 10-minute
141:28 - break it helps break up the work and it
141:31 - helps to more accurately estimate the
141:33 - time the tasks take so the the dark
141:35 - numbers in Trello or how many Pomodoro
141:39 - sessions I think it's going to take and
141:41 - the lighter numbers are how many it
141:43 - actually took me to do I see now that
141:49 - Sara already answered Andrews it's
141:51 - thanks there sorry I didn't see that I
141:53 - was
141:55 - anyway those those two cadets and
141:59 - Patrick answered as well to man ten as
142:04 - what software are you using for your dev
142:05 - server basically it's just like it's web
142:09 - pack but it I don't have to customize it
142:11 - myself because next Jas is automatically
142:14 - running it so that's part of the reason
142:16 - why I haven't even dug into the issue
142:17 - because I I didn't need to set it up
142:20 - myself so I know like I'm gonna have to
142:22 - learn how it was set up before I can
142:25 - even try to fix it so but basically it
142:29 - is web pack though Sebastian says I
142:35 - think you have some more posts with data
142:38 - - JSX I think you're right - because I
142:41 - was copy and pasting earlier in the day
142:42 - and I didn't remove that so I'm gonna
142:44 - have to go back and double-check
142:45 - everything
143:00 - well Andrew says in my country for West
143:03 - bust courses I get a 52% discount that's
143:05 - sweet wit what country are you from
143:07 - Andrew you probably told me before so
143:10 - sorry I don't I don't remember but we'll
143:15 - see if you if that 52% is a big discount
143:17 - it might be worth moving for I'm just
143:21 - joking it probably wouldn't be but maybe
143:24 - if you're gonna take enough courses
143:30 - Manny says have you tried fetching from
143:33 - Component did mount and saving your data
143:35 - in your app state object yeah I actually
143:38 - do that on some of the pages some of the
143:41 - components but the thing is with with
143:44 - next J s you if you want it to be able
143:48 - to render server-side you have to fetch
143:52 - the data from in here from get initial
143:54 - props so what I do if I want to put it
143:56 - into state is I end up in component did
143:58 - mount transferring the data into state
144:02 - so I still grab it here and it still
144:05 - goes to props first and then it goes
144:07 - into state and then I can you know
144:10 - manipulate the data use it after at that
144:12 - point so on this page I really don't
144:15 - have any need to save it the state
144:16 - because I'm not like I don't ever need
144:19 - to change it to make things rerender or
144:21 - happen so but on on some pages like the
144:23 - resource page I do I am doing that but
144:28 - it still I still grab everything
144:30 - initially with this get initial props
144:33 - just for the sake of the server-side
144:34 - rendering
144:50 - okay Manny says you Demi's modern react
144:53 - and redux is very awesome for starting
144:56 - out a very awesome course so albury
144:58 - person says thank you Jesse for the
145:00 - advice you're welcome I hope some of it
145:02 - is helpful to you and make sure like if
145:05 - you can come back some other live chats
145:07 - and let us know like how it's going and
145:09 - what resources you found helpful I think
145:12 - that would be awesome it'd be helpful
145:13 - for me and I'm sure would probably be
145:14 - helpful for some other people that are
145:16 - that are watching Manny says learn a lot
145:21 - from you awesome I'm glad I'm but glad
145:24 - that I could be helpful a lot of times I
145:26 - feel like I'm not really being helpful
145:28 - to you all you are teaching me a lot so
145:31 - it's nice when sometimes I I'm doing the
145:35 - teaching a little bit all right so
145:41 - Andrew posted the link again yeah me
145:45 - maybe I thought I got rid of all the
145:47 - spaces let me try it again
145:54 - yeah it did work I must have just left
145:57 - the space in there and didn't realize it
145:59 - oh very cool
146:11 - that's really cool Andrew I'm checking
146:14 - out on my other screen I don't know if
146:15 - you want me to show it to everybody in
146:17 - the live stream or not so that's why I
146:19 - open it on the other stream or the other
146:21 - screen that's really cool I like that
146:33 - yeah so if if anyone is sharing any of
146:37 - their own work by default I will just
146:39 - open it on another screen in case you
146:42 - don't want everybody to be able to see
146:45 - it in the stream you know and in the
146:47 - recording but if you don't mind that
146:49 - just let me know when you give me the
146:51 - link and then I can as long as it's
146:55 - appropriate if nobody's ever tried to
146:56 - share anything inappropriate but as long
146:58 - as it's appropriate I'll put it up there
147:01 - that's also another reason why I open it
147:03 - on a separate screen just on on the off
147:05 - chance that someone would happen to post
147:12 - something inappropriate actually that
147:16 - link the Heroku link is it's not working
147:25 - for me it's saying access denied for me
147:33 - why is it saying what are Y saying
147:36 - asketh access denied when I try to put
147:40 - the link in okay I see you posted
147:46 - another link a little a little bit after
148:09 - okay ceressus 72 and 98 so I assume
148:14 - that's in response to my question about
148:15 - the pricing for for West boss and Manny
148:18 - also recommends West boss okay that's
148:20 - not too bad actually
148:22 - oh yeah that's a decent price so 72
148:26 - dollars 98 so it seems like West boss is
148:29 - the way to go I might even have to check
148:31 - that out I mean like I said I there's no
148:33 - way I could do another course right now
148:34 - but I'll keep that in mind for the
148:35 - future okay Andrew says Moldova cool so
148:39 - you're from so I have three three of my
148:44 - wife's cousins were adopted from Moldova
148:47 - so that's what I remember when they were
148:49 - adopted they were just really little and
148:51 - could barely speak English or anything
148:54 - and I remember visiting with my wife's
148:57 - and uncle and they live they live in a
149:02 - different state so went down there and
149:05 - stayed with them for like a week and
149:06 - helped out with the kids and everything
149:08 - it was cool when now the kids are like
149:10 - they're teenagers so it makes me feel
149:14 - old
149:15 - but anyway that's cool and I I get I
149:19 - know people from Moldova
149:34 - okay rich Rishabh I'm not sure I
149:40 - pronounce a so sorry
149:41 - but rich a vas hey I just came to this
149:44 - live video I want to know how we can
149:45 - link with react I want to know
149:48 - that suit actually says so in this video
149:52 - I'm actually linking WordPress with
149:54 - react through the WordPress API so I'm
149:57 - not dealing with a database directly
150:00 - there's like the WordPress API is
150:02 - sitting between the database and it's a
150:05 - different kind so I mean WordPress uses
150:07 - a sequel database which is definitely
150:09 - different than so at some point
150:13 - it's likely that I will do something
150:16 - that uses a database with react
150:19 - but I can't I can't guarantee when that
150:22 - project will happen so so I can't answer
150:25 - your question right now unfortunately
150:27 - but I hope that in the future I can do
150:30 - more streams with with and react
150:38 - okay see you later mani
150:40 - mandis gotta head out thanks thanks for
150:44 - watching I know you're contributing in
150:48 - the latch at
150:58 - Patrick says in response to the question
151:01 - about DB says I would expect you
151:04 - would want to write a back-end service
151:06 - in something like no tour Express to
151:10 - provide endpoints for interacting with
151:12 - MongoDB yeah that's actually that's a
151:15 - really good answer so I mean that would
151:17 - be you know that wanting in specifics of
151:20 - how you do that that I mean that would
151:22 - be the way to go you obviously you
151:24 - wouldn't be reacting like you wouldn't
151:25 - be going directly from reacts like
151:28 - client-side directly to a database most
151:30 - likely you would have some sort of I get
151:33 - would you call that a middleware I don't
151:35 - know but but your back-end node Express
151:38 - would be interacting with the database
151:40 - and then sending that so
151:51 - yes Sebastian says sorry about the
151:53 - language change Sebastian just started
151:55 - talking in another language in the live
151:57 - chat or typing in another language
152:00 - birdperson says thank you very much
152:02 - Jessy I was glad to spent this time with
152:04 - FCC campers jordan says shouldn't you be
152:08 - going home Jessie yeah I should I was
152:09 - just thinking the same thing so anyway
152:12 - you're welcome birdperson so yeah I'm
152:15 - glad you spent time with us as well so
152:18 - yeah anyway I think I am gonna wrap it
152:20 - up cuz it's 7:00 and I need to go home
152:24 - and put my kids to sleep so yeah so I
152:30 - kinda hope to get a little bit more done
152:32 - but unfortunately I did have some silly
152:36 - issues that came up and we're entirely
152:38 - just my fault for not paying attention
152:41 - more closely to my code so I need to
152:45 - commit those last couple changes we made
152:48 - to get rid of the errors and that's
152:51 - about it I'm going to commit that I'm
152:53 - going to push everything up to the dev
152:55 - server and I might check the dev server
152:58 - to make sure it does it quits just
153:00 - shutting down and then that way at least
153:02 - it'll be open to anyone who wants to see
153:05 - it and then I'll I'll be here tomorrow
153:08 - morning and I'll do some more work and
153:10 - I'll see you all tomorrow I'm pretty
153:13 - sure that I can do the stream at the
153:16 - normal time tomorrow I have a meeting
153:18 - with a potential client at 5:00 p.m. so
153:24 - it won't be a super long stream but I
153:26 - could probably do like an hour hour and
153:28 - a half stream and still have enough time
153:30 - to make it to the meeting so anyway it
153:36 - was it was cool I'm glad I got to do
153:38 - this and death see some different people
153:40 - probably because of the different you
153:41 - know time that I strained that so
153:44 - tomorrow it'll be at the normal time
153:46 - most likely 2 p.m. Eastern time thank
153:49 - you so much everyone for watching and
153:51 - for helping out and in the live chat is
153:54 - really awesome and really cool just
153:57 - working on this project you you all have
153:59 - been like kind of with this project for
154:01 - the whole
154:01 - time you know pretty much from the
154:03 - beginning so this is very much like I
154:05 - think our project together and it's
154:07 - really cool so I can't wait to like be
154:09 - done with it and move on but then you
154:11 - know have this entire project from start
154:14 - to finish like all live-streamed I think
154:18 - that's that's gonna be really cool so
154:21 - anyway good night everybody at least in
154:24 - my timezone good night and have a great
154:26 - night I'll see y'all tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody is Jessie a little bit later today than I normally am so sorry for everybody who you know won't be able to see this hopefully you can least catch the recording but maybe it might be better for some people because instead of coming in at the end of my normal 2 o'clock train you'll be at the beginning of the stream today that's at 430 Eastern Time it's really hot in my office so I do have a fan running let me know if that's making a lot of noise if it's annoying I'll turn it off it's not like unbearably hot so I can stand to turn it off today I'm gonna start out by showing some of the issues that I had yesterday that I was able to fix and I'll show you those had a few like little design changes for the the resource page basically I implemented a lot of what we had talked about yesterday and and then I'm going to show you what I'm doing with the API calls so we're gonna do I'm basically going to be trying to pull in as much of the content as I possibly can from the WordPress API so that the when I'm done with this project they'll be like really no need for anyone to contact me and the people in charge of the content for the site will be able to handle all that content so assuming that nothing like really crazy happens with the site I should be able to just just let it go off on its own which that'll be good I really like working on this I learned a lot of stuff but I am ready to move on it's nice to it's nice to start over with a clean slate and be able to try to do even better than last time all right so I'm just going to check okay great we got our view count is up to a decent amount I always hate to get like right into it before people have had a chance to to join in and I know that this was really late notice I think I I posted on Twitter about it like five minutes maybe four minutes before I was going to stream so they'll probably be some people joining in late because they didn't see it but I'm gonna check the live chat hey hi hey everyone a lot of people saying hi okay so Anthony says there's just a little bit of background noise not that bad okay so cool yeah let me know if it if it does end up being bad so like I'm actually the fan is sitting it's kind of blowing directly on the microphone so I am gonna move it a bit and then that should cut down on the noise and I know uh you know wind can makes really bad noise on a microphone so I don't want the same thing to happen here Anthony says I started frontend course two weeks ago and I finished algorithm today yeah all right way to go that glad to hear that you're you're getting through some of this stuff keep me uptodate if you can in the live chat I'd love to to hear about more about your progress and that's yeah Sarah said Mike's catch everything yeah it definitely it does so just I'm like turn it off after a little while anyway it actually has done a decent job of getting thing called getting things cooled down a bit so the reason I didn't stream at my normal time listen because I had a meeting the meeting I might have been able to get in like a really really short stream in and still make it to the meeting but I didn't want to try to you know do a really short stream and have it not be kind of like as good as normal I probably would have had time to do any questions or anything so I thought I'd better just a postpone it I plan on working late today anyway so so this this should work out I kind of thought I'd be able to get out of the meeting so that's why I didn't I didn't post earlier about the time change but then like right before maybe like within an hour before the normal extreme time I learned that I I was I had to go to the meeting so that's why I was kind of late notice okay well let me show you Jordan says moving the fan didn't change the sound sounds like you're sitting in a server rooms let me let me turn the fan I can actually turn it down I'll try turning it down a little bit right now and then if I have to I can turn it off completely I also do have another computer on that I don't normally have one so and it's kind of noisy as well I don't know how it turned on I thought I had it off maybe I just had it asleep but I do never like a really old Windows laptop that I keep around just in case I need it so I I almost never need it because I use a browser stack for testing now but before I had that it did come in handy for testing things okay cool so it seems like that sounds better now that the fans turned on all right so let me start showing you a little bit about what's changed since yesterday what's been updated the development site let me put the link I forgot to put the link in the description for the show so let me find the link now and you know I'll post it here we go have a lot of stuff open so here's the link to we now have a development server so normally before I was just doing everything locally which is okay but you weren't able to actually interact with the site near the latest version of the site before it really went live unless you clone the git repo and ran it you know locally on your machine so I had already had another droplet already set up and ready from when we were testing the load balancing and I never I never shut that droplet down so I had always planned on using it as a development server at some point so that is up and running now so you can check out the IP address if if I forget to put it in the the video and you're watching this later on the IP address is 1 6 2 dot 3.2 for 3.8 6.67 oh it's not working again it keeps stopping so it's right now I'm not running it with from from p.m. to and so it's possible that I just need to set that up it's probably not gonna do it right now there you go so I'm gonna start it up again alright it should be working now so I'm gonna try to refresh my page in my other screen okay it is working out I just didn't take the time to set it up in a more reliable way because at first I was only using it just to just to test a few things out but since then I had requests from other people to work here to see the site so now I probably ought to set it up in a better way pushpush Pinder asks about is it possible to get the live session on the weekend the recording will be available so you can definitely check out the recording I probably won't do another live session on the weekend but the recording is definitely available so it'll be right here on the free code camp channel there's actually a playlist for all the streams so if you don't see it on like the main page you can check the playlist is just called live coding with Jesse but if you're gonna view it you know sometimes the next day or two it'll probably one of the first videos up on the main page okay all right so let me show you now you can see the site now and actually I don't have it looks like I don't have the the very latest stuff but so I'll bring the latest stuff up on my screen okay see I was wondering where am i when my browser window went so went here I think I have it the site up somewhere else so let's pull it over and now I can't find it oh well not a problem just go to localhost okay so nothing new so yeah nothing new there on the about page figures my dev server needs to be started again I never bothered to figure out why my dev server always needs restarted and only on this computer I can run the same same stuff on my other computers and it works so anyway so on this page it doesn't look like much has changed but all of this data is now being pulled in from the wordpress api so all the text with the exception of I think this title is still hardcoded and the image you can see I need to work on the formatting a bit I think WordPress is automatically wrapping this in a P tag and so it's messing up the formatting so I'll have to I'll have to account for that it'll probably be easier just to account for that in the code then to try to change how WordPress does things because sometimes I do want them to actually use wrap things in P tags but sometimes I don't the only visible change here other than that kind of mistake is I'm actually pulling in the the test pages now the data before I had just made some lists just just to see how it would look now I'm actually pulling this in so when we click it the link works and it goes to our page it's still just test data but hopefully we'll get some real data in there and be able to kind of get a better idea of how it looks and on our resources page this is where we have the biggest change so I switched up from the black which you can see on the dev site right now so I had the black before and I've switched it to the red the red background with it has like this semi transparent background image kind of going across here and then now you know everything's white the check marks end up being like that gold color that's on the site so I'm not sure if I like it being gold what I might end up switching it back to white but for now I think the gold is okay so before some of this stuff was gray but it just doesn't look very good against the red so I did I got some feedback yesterday from you all and I got some feedback from some of the people involved in the project here where I work and general consensus was going with the red would probably be better so with the red and then I increased the padding a bit just to kind of it looked really weird with this background image when it was shorter so that's why I increased the padding a bit but basically everything still functions the same way so everything works I didn't get a chance to check this out on multiple browsers so we did have a an issue open up on github based on what we saw in the stream yesterday and that was that on some browsers especially windows browsers one of them in Windows this this doesn't look right so I'll still have to check that out on some browsers but I didn't want to do it if I was gonna change a lot of the colors anyway I wanted to wait until I changed it before I tried to troubleshoot that so that's something I'll be doing soon or that's something that's that's open for for anybody to you know try out if you'd like to and submit a pull request I did have a pull request that I pulled in from Bill so let me show you I'll be I'll show you and I'll explain to you so since I've only pulled it in on the dev branch I don't think he shows up yet in the official like contributors page but basically bills contributions were pretty nice and that he I didn't have a unique ID a unique key for each of these which you need and reactor it gives you an error message it still loads it but within the console you get an error message in dev tools and then he added this is actually a horizontal rule now before we had a black bottom border now this is an HR and with some shadows and gradients and things going on actually I think this is how do you do is I think this was a background gradient so I only changed what bill sent in just a bit so I just lightened it a bit I checked out the material design documentation on how to do lists and they're lines between the lists are very light so I decided to go with that since we're kind of trying to follow material design principles here and also he put in a little bit of code to make sure that the last in the list the last element in the list doesn't have an HR at the bottom so that's it not not a whole lot happening I didn't get to do quite as much work as I had hopes because I had meetings like kind of unexpected meetings this morning that lasted lasted a while but it was good I guess we'll get feedback for this site so it worked out alright so I'm gonna move this over because I don't really need it right now we'll leave this here so we can keep referring back to it but I want to show you let me uh organize this a bit better here we go but I want to show you the about page and how I pulled in the the data and actually let me check the live chat I had an idea so normally I use a Pomodoro timer so you use this and I thought I should I'm gonna start using this timer now and that way if it goes off it'll be a reminder for me to check the live chat so I don't forget so hopefully I'll check it you know before it goes off but just in case you know at least every 25 minutes I'll check it and then that'll give me just a little reminder of how long these things are taking because I usually forget to record how long things take during my streaming so let me check back in the in the chat here okay not a whole lot going on the chat hey Sebastian how's it going but my employer is now in the live chat Franciscan University Steubenville it's not it's it's actually the the guy that works in the office right next to me he must just be logged into the Franciscan University YouTube account so he told me that my mom was online too but instead of he's just kidding okay so John says thin light thin border lines are easiest by using one pixel inset and a very light gray okay cool I might try that I am I kind of just went with what what bill had for this and just lightened it a bit but if I get a chance maybe I'll try to you know change it even more I wouldn't mind it being a bit thinner I mean I think this I think this looks fine to me but but a little bit thinner probably would match more with what's in the material design documentation so so thanks for that I'm like I'm kind of getting down to the wire here so I'm only gonna work on things that are absolutely necessary but I can see like I'm I'm a little bit confident now that I can get done what I need to get done before the 20th and then I'll switch to another project but it seems like I'm gonna be able to get things done I say that knowing that I usually run into unforeseen issues that take longer so assuming that I don't run into too many of those should get everything done then I won't have to work crazy hours all right so I'm gonna show you what I gonna show you all the about page I have the music I'm playing in my headphones is from Spotify throwbackthursday playlist and this week it's on 90s music and so if you grew up in the 90s like I did it will be nostalgic for you I find myself remembering like lots of stuff that happened in middle school in grade school that I associate with these songs alright so at the top here before so as of yesterday I wasn't pulling any data in for this page it was all coded directly into this component now I'm gonna pull in more data so the big problem that I've been wrestling with and I've mentioned it a few times on the in the live stream is that I needed a way to get multiple data from multiple different post types in one API call so I needed it to be here because I wanted anything in here gets rendered on the server so the API call will actually get made on the server and everything will get rendered and then the data will get sent to the client as an HTML page and then it can also be made when you do clientside routing so the same call could be made on the client the problem was when I tried to write some code to do multiple calls inside here I always got errors it's possible that there's a way to do it and I just I just couldn't figure it out so I found another way there's a plugin for the WordPress for WordPress that exposes this endpoint this multiple post type endpoint and then you can say what types of posts you want so right now I want the PDF page post type and then I want just the page post type I didn't want to do this because you can't if you specify parameters for you know for how you want to narrow this data down the parameters apply to every post type so it's not that useful because certain post types have different they have different data that's coming through and I have different needs to the post type so what I'm gonna have to do to make this work is this is fine but I'm now going to end up getting more data I would normally need and it should work for most pages the only pages where it's going to be a little bit tough is if I happen to have a page that has a lot of different data I might not get it all with this hundred per page thing and that's that's the WordPress limit you can't easily get more than 100 posts per page and I don't have time to try to work around that so probably what will end up happening is everything that's essential that I really want to be rendered on the server will be in this first API call and then if there's other things that should be rendered later on they can be rendered later on I'll render it in another API call so usually it'll be based on a user interaction and that's fine so then upon that interaction it'll make the call and and that should be fine it should work if for some reason there's a page where there's some data that just needs to display and there's no user interaction I can make it happen on a scroll so perhaps if a user gets like halfway down the page then I'll make the call and load the stuff at the bottom of the page it should work out none of the pages right now are so big that it won't work but today I'm actually gonna do some of this I'm kind of showing you how I did it first and then I'm gonna do it on some pages so we'll find out if it'll work for all the pages but since I did that the API call I get back has all the PDF pages and all the page post types and so down here I started doing things like for the intersection I made a page in WordPress called about intro so I'm grabbing the the page that has about interest I'm using filter and then I'm I'm rendering the content of that page inside this this column div so I've had to move the float X class up here to the column instead of having it on the P tag which is fine because I don't want the person entering things in WordPress to have to worry about any code so why don't you just be able to use the the WYSIWYG in WordPress which will automatically add eat eggs but it won't automatically add the classes we want one thing I didn't know about is I use the map here just because I was copy and pasting some stuff I was doing elsewhere there's only one post that I really want so I'm not sure if I have to use map so if there's a better way to do this where I can just grab this right from filter and use it let me know if anybody knows it if not I'm I'm not really gonna take the time to look it up right now because this works and this is okay because if I ever have to grab more than one post type and render it it's already set up to be able to handle that but for now this is the sodus you see I've done that for each section so let me show you let's go back to the about page just to see so each section is now its own page in WordPress and I can show you what it looks like in WordPress as well so in WordPress if we go to pages see I have about intro that's the top part the about quote banner is down here section 2 section 3 so that's what I'm gonna do the only things that aren't on there right now these I didn't put in they're not editable in these for now I don't think I'm going to put them in because the odds of these changing are really small so there's not really high turn over here at the university especially for the upper level positions you know once people get up there they stay there forever until they're ready to retire also I'm not sure that these will change soon enough so if I have time later on maybe I'll do this but for now I think it's okay to keep these hardcoded because for these I would have to probably have to make custom post types so it's a little bit more work than just an extra page so I want to make a custom post type for this you know kind of bio card and then iterate over that render it and then the same thing here it would be a custom post type for these collaborator cards so I don't want to do all that for those sections right now since they're not likely to change but I want to check out we'll start with the home page and we'll just check out my service topic this is driving me crazy if I had only just took like you know 15 minutes a month ago to fix this when it first happened I wouldn't have to worry about this and I still I still never take the time all right so on the home page I'm gonna leave all this up here hardcoded this is not likely to change and I really don't want it to change because all of the spacing and everything on all the screen sizes is pretty exact if someone went in here and changed this and made it a lot bigger or something it it would mess everything up so don't want that to change the video for now I'm gonna leave it like this at some point it might not be a bad idea to have a page with a custom field that was just the embed code for this video to be able to change it but for now I think it's it's okay like that I want to make these their own custom post type so we'll definitely be pulling in we're gonna make the post type for this and then pull in the data the the image for this is gonna change but I don't think I'm gonna take the time to put it in here if I'm gonna make this editable from WordPress then we'll see maybe the person in charge of the content will do that the person in charge of the content and her name is Amy I always just keep saying the person in charge of the content but it's much shorter to just say Amy so Amy is gonna put probably put the the new image in I can show you the image though this is it's going to be this image so which will work well because then the the title will go down here and this section will be darkened a bit so it's perfect image too to put the title there it won't really block anything this section which I've already made a page for this section will be editable I'm glad Google Calendar let me know that today is garbage day or tomorrow is garbage day so I need to put the garbage out today so glad for that reminder and then these will be pulled in from the API as well so we're gonna have three three different sections so we're going to need three different post types this will be a from the page post type this will be from I guess we'll call this the formation cards yeah I'm not sure what else to call them right now but the formation card post type and this will come from the the news or the blog actually we won't need to make a new post type because I'm gonna pull these from there just the normal posts that are built in to WordPress so that should be okay as is and if I have time I may change how these look but I think they're okay right now I just don't like that I've like kind of made them all have a max height and there's all this space but I'm not sure I'll have time to really do what I need to to make them look how I want them to look all right so let's go in and work on this I'll connect this up first and these because I already have the post types made and then I'll decide whether or not I actually want to make a new post type during the stream or not let me know in the live chat if you'd like to see me create a post site but I've already done it a few times so you may not even want to see again it doesn't take very long but may not be very interesting all right oops not moose no is there some setting that I can edit so that the my Mac doesn't automatically change the order of my my desktops like that's for some reason it always does that and I don't like it I have them in the order that I want them in alright so we need to find our home pages are the index page and make it slightly bigger check this so I'm gonna grab the about page and move it over I have so much going on here let me get rid of some of these things serious like such changes no I don't think I changed it no okay so oh you know what I had I just occurred to me I had one other error that kept happening at the end and I didn't show you how I fixed that error so the error was that every time I tried to go to one of those single pages that the PDF pages that we were linking to from the about page I would get an error about the side nav init function and I figured out what the problem was the problem was that in the layouts so in in the layout components I didn't have these two dots here so it was just going to static jazz app touches which was fine normally it was working normally for some reason when it was coming from one of those pages that we were using the parameterised routing for it just wasn't working so the reason it I didn't catch it before was because the the one page that I was looking off of that did work was he wasn't using the layout it was using the old style of how we did this so anyway that's all I had to fix and it fixed everything so it took a while to figure it out but it was an easy fix once once I did all right so now I'm going to take the about page and move it over here so that we can copy and paste some stuff if we need to and I do want to copy and paste this it's not really fun to type out so we want to hit that end point that multiple post type end point that we get from the plugin and we're gonna need we don't need PDF page when you post I think post is the post type we'll see in a second we either get the data we want and then we want page we haven't made that other post type yet so I'm not I'm going to try to get it because we'll get an error and I can check this right away to see if it worked by going into dev tools for the site and we can go into the react dev tools screen and we'll see our props up here oops we're getting an empty objects I did something wrong so let me maybe I need to say posts which I it again hmm still not get anything all right so I'm gonna just grab this and we'll try it out right in the browser hmm not getting anything okay we should have gotten something on that first time oops I grabbed the wrong site it ought to it autofilled this other site which I also built in a similar way okay so this is better so this is giving us what we need I'm not sure why it didn't work the first time I did it let's try it again and I'm gonna manually refresh this it's possible it was just a refresh problem there we go and now we have everything safe props and we can filter things by its type if we need to or filter by anything we want but for the news part we're gonna filter by post and then we're gonna filter secondarily by we have a custom field where's our custom field ID so why our type inside this advanced custom field okay I'm gonna check the lights out again it's been a while this timer actually is really helping me to remember how long it's been d 404 says just arrived welcome also after you use the fetch API to get your data I do I do tests or I do use the fetch API so I recommend using it if you haven't tried it yet definitely try it out it's way easier than any other method I've ever used to make API calls and don't worry about the browser support just use the polyfill so as long as you use the polyfill you should be fine on most modern browsers it even works on it works on Internet Explorer 11 so definitely it's definitely worth learning it'll save you time it's just so much more simple I really like it a lot better then do the other ways of making API calls with you know Ajax or you know just like a plain xhr request Sebastian asks what do you need tested on edge ok the yeah the drop down the the select input on the resources page was acting weird if you check out the the github repo there's an issue open for that okay so Sarah Sarah tested her on Firefox and it looks fine on Firefox that's awesome but it looks like she said Opera and Chrome on on windows are not it's like waiting out everything so I have to test that out okay yeah if you want to see it in action I did put a link in so maybe for everyone that's come in a little bit later on I'll put the link in the live chat again for the dev server hopefully it's working and it didn't quit working again okay it's still working so should be able to go there okay blad says just landed here why does jessie have a timer running it's a Pomodoro timer which I usually run this all the time when I'm working and I record how long it takes me to do everything I record that in my Trello board so you can check out my Trello board I just not realised I have my calendar up here so I've been showing everyone everything I'm doing all month so I hope there's nothing embarrassing up there and it's not as my wife's calendar on there too so I really don't have a good idea of what's on there because she could have put anything in there so maybe I'll have to move that to another screen for future streams or just get rid of it maybe that's better I'll just headaches it out of anyway so like these numbers that are on my Trello board and there's a link to my Trello board in the description if you want to check it out these are like the dark numbers or how many plummeted or cycles I estimate that a task will take and then the greyed out ones or the the slightly transparent ones are how long it actually has taken me so this is really helpful for me to be able to like I can go back in and see how long things took me before it's helpful for being able to accurately estimate future projects how much time it will take me and it is helpful as well for me to remember just to take a break because otherwise I would just keep working and working and lose track of time so for every time I get through a 25minute session I take a five minute break after four sessions I take a ten minute break which is the long gray and during that time I can check my email I check Twitter you know get up and walk around so often times that'll be a nice break for me to just evaluate like is what I'm doing right now the most important thing I could be doing should I switch to something else like just gives my brain a break and I noticed when I don't do that I can they get stuck on one problem for hours and hours and not get anywhere and sometimes I shouldn't worried about that problem I should have just let it go and moved on but since I never really stopped to think about it I don't make that decision so this is a really nice way of doing things and I know I've seen actually a lot of people use this and there's even a one of the free code camp challenges is to make your own Pomodoro clock I haven't gotten to that challenge yet so I am still working through my free code camp frontend certification it's actually I'm gonna do here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do my short break and then I know if this time is up then I should probably get back to coding again our likeness this I'm gonna try to remember this from now on we're gonna do Pomodoro sessions and we're gonna try to stick to during the session we code and then during the break we talk and that might be a more that'll be a nicer flow for things and then it'll let you all know like what's coming yeah I like that idea let me know if you think about that I think it should it should work but has anybody made the Pomodoro timer and the free code camp thing right now I'm working on my well I should say I finished working on my weather my weather thing my weather app but I didn't I didn't move on like I didn't end in a link to anything because I was gonna style it but functionally it can it works it works fine I just haven't done any anything to style it yet and I built it in reacts all right so I'm gonna check out okay so it looks like Sebastian also is verifying that chrome and edge or white for that talking about this this dropdown is it's all white and you can't see anything on chrome and edge for for Windows so I have to work on that oh yes Patrick you're my hero today alright so a few minutes ago I had asked about these desktops being rearranged automatically and I don't want that to happen so Patrick just sent me instructions on how to do this so I'll do it on this screen so in case you've ever had a similar problem we have System Preferences and Mission Control and uncheck oh wow that's really obvious so I even asked that everybody I should have just I should have just checked so we'll uncheck that and then that will fix the problem awesome I'm actually I was like a Windows user for my entire life until I got this job and I've been working here for almost two years so I've only been a Mac user for about two years less than two years so still don't really know enough and and actually I come way behind because Windows 10 like I haven't really used Windows 10 that much so I don't know what's going on there so I feel like I'm not really an expert in any operating system like if you like put me in front of a Windows XP computer then I would be fine I can do anything you want me to do but right now I am NOT not an expert at any operating system oh cool so Patrick actually like look that up and figured it out because that annoyed him as well so awesome Thank You Patrick thanks for taking the time to do that okay Vlad says it's a really interesting way to keep track and make sure you're working smart I may steal the process from you yeah feel free to steal it for me I took it from somebody else so I definitely did not invent this I did a course on Pluralsight because I got a free like three months subscription to Flora site and there was a course on using agile methodologies for one so usually agile was used for teams well I pretty much work just myself on all my projects so I thought it sounded really cool and I took the course and part of the course was talking about the Pomodoro timer and so that's where I picked that up from and I thought I'd give it a trial and use it for a few weeks and see how I liked it and that was last year and I've liked it so much I've continued to use it for for all my my projects occasionally I'll do a little side project where I won't use it but sometimes even on side projects I I still use it because it's still a good idea to you know break up the work like that okay Sara says she's on the jQuery part now for free code camp so cool yeah that would be cool if you all are doing the free code camp stuff too it would be fun to know what what part you all are on so if you're in the live chat right now and you can type go ahead and type if you feel like sharing of like about where you're at and if you're watching this later on you put it in the comments that'd be really cool just to get an idea of where we're all at if if if you are doing the free code camp challenges I had a question about the Trello Adams so actually so my my time here for my short break is up so I'm just gonna answer this last question and then get back to the code the question was about the Trello addons that I'm using with the Pomodoro Technique so yeah that's a great question let me I believe that this is actually a Chrome extension so let me see let's assume my extensions are okay so here are my extensions I'm gonna make this bigger yeah okay so where's that there we go so the extension is called scrum for Trello so I think that's it I think on a previous livestream I may have said that it was a Trello addon but I think I was mistaken so I apologize if anybody tried to add this in Trello and couldn't find the addon but then later on I I realized that it was an extension and I had meant to mention it in a stream after that and then I forgot until now so so that's really cool while I'm in here my extensions I'll show you this is a really useful extension this tells me like how what websites are built on so I'm constantly using this when I see a website that I like or one that's really terrible and I just want to see like what what do they build this with yeah this is Michael tampermonkey is the one that you need to make the colors on github change so react dev tools is how I get the react stuff in the in from developer tools and something what else all the JSON format err definitely recommend that if you want to check out JSON data that's why when I look at the data from the WordPress API it looks nice and not all jumbled and I think that's it for like developer stuff browsers that local I've actually never used this I download this and I never used it at all so I can't really say whether it's good or not and then retired j/s is kind of cool you can see if there's any vulnerable JavaScript libraries being used on any of your sites it's not bad but I found like 99% of the time it just shows like some version of jQuery as being vulnerable which which is ok but it's not like that useful because if everybody is using this same vulnerable version like I don't I don't know like there's got to be some version of jQuery that's not vulnerable but it seems like everybody that's using jQuery it shows up as vulnerable so anyway hopefully that was a little bit helpful can't believe I never thought of showing that before because I use those really often so you can see this is that analyzer here it's telling me that Trello was built with jQuery they're using Quantcast for analytics and Google tag manager and Google Analytics so this is actually this is crazy I wouldn't guesti if I were to guess that I thought Trello was built with some sort of like JavaScript framework but it's it's actually just all jQuery crazy I've been surprised to see how many sites are built with react now that I didn't realize her built with react so which one was I was on GoDaddy recently and GoDaddy site is now built with react that was a little surprising Wow okay so the song you guys remember the song Mmmbop from the 90s from by a Hansen that just came on I'm definitely gonna skip that it's nostalgic but not not really the song I want to listen to okay so let me get back to the code now I did ask a question and I'm getting answers in the live chat I'll read them off really quick it's not really polite to ask a question and then ignore the answers oh cool so Patrick has done the Pomodoro thing and actually put a link to it in the live chat so I'm gonna check it out and while that's loading yeah that's nachiket says join the camp only a day ago and have reached only till bootstrap also well you got a good start good start keep doing keep going and keep us updated on how it goes inside the matrix is on the twitch API projects about halfway done with it also gave your Pomodoro a heart Patrick all right cool it oh okay so here's Patrick's Pomodoro nice I like that okay oh so it automatically takes you into the break interesting that's cool we can double click to reset that's really cool I'm gonna check out the code to this later on that's awesome yeah thanks for uh thanks for sharing that link hey Andrew so Andrew joining us welcome glad you can make it inside the matrix says I've been listening in 90s rock such alternative on Pandora lately so many middleschool memories yeah we must be a brown the same age because that's I was in grade school in Middle School in the 90s as well so it's always it's always fun to listen to the old music and then just have all these memories come up Manny says it would be cool to link the timer to the Trello board and have it forcefully limit how much time you can spend on each feature I think it would increase productivity man he also says 90s for the best hey Manny I'm not I'm not sure if I've seen you post in the live chat before so I may be mistaken but if this is your first time posting then welcome and thanks for contributing here in the live chat yeah Manny that's like a really really good idea I'm not sure how I would accomplish that but I think that would be a really cool side project okay jonbi says hi hi again hey how's it going glad you could make it alright so let me go back I spent a lot more time so that the Pomodoro timer only really is effective if you if you pay attention to it and actually stop working or start working when you're supposed to that's a top tip for me you have to be disciplined about it alright so now we're back on our homepage we're getting the data that we need so now all we have to do is render that data in the right places so okay I was thinking that where's all their stuff that I forgot it's down the bottom because this is the alternate version of the homepage that will end up being the new version all right so this is where we're gonna put our the data from our quote so I need to figure out what the what the slug is for that so let me do that you find the slug pretty sure it as the word quote in it maybe it doesn't I have to bring up the the actual WordPress and bring it over let's see oh I didn't even call it quote I called it home black banner instead of quote banner so I guess that works yeah that it works because we're not we're not actually using a quote in there before it used to be a quote and now it's the mission statement so this yeah this actually does describe what it is so I'm assuming that that's the yeah that's the we need okay so we're gonna grab and we'll need to change this as well because we're not this is the the old information that was there okay so I know I was going to copy copy this to make it easier I should copy I have a similar section on the about page so I will copy the section that most closely matches it I think it's up up here here it is so I'm a copy and paste but then I'll go through what it does mmm this is actually a little bit different because we have this h3 but it is inside the block how are you gonna do this okay I think maybe we can do this so I'm gonna change it up a little bit so this is still gonna be we're still gonna have this blockquote like we do here but I want to have well actually is that why they're automatically make it a div I think I figured out why it wasn't formatting properly I didn't realize that it happened so that's cool I might have fixed this just by this and I won't have to worry about it again so let's check this out rearrange this because this will be good if this works now then that'll save me a bit of time anybody remember Lauryn Hill from the 90s just just had Lauryn Hill come along Spotify if you'd like to follow along with my playlist as well check out the throwback Thursday playlist on Spotify nice alright so that was the issue with the formatting so awesome so I inadvertently figured that out as always this is fun alright so let's I still need to do it alter this just a bit well I mean I need to make this home and inside of the block quote we're gonna have an h3 and the h3 is going to have the title wait no it won't because we have a title already we already have it site or the title is the home black banner okay so we can't do it like that but since WordPress already has a way to make things like an H tag without having to deal with the code then I'm okay with leaving it like that so I think we can safely just bring in everything including that that H tag and it should be pretty obvious to whoever is is updating it that it should work so I'm gonna copy this paste it in here and make sure see that's an h3 so it's already you know it's easy and WordPress to make that in h3 and let's check out the code really quickly so h3 I didn't realize when I copied it over it grabbed that I don't want that to stay that could cause problems I may have to double check and make sure that it didn't do it with other things as well okay so we'll update that so we can get there the correct data in there and then now we'll get rid of this block load and oops we need to make sure we close that I'm not worried about the formatting says we'll have once we once we commit this it will auto format it for us but it looks like something is making there we go the highlighting was just weird but I think that all right everything should work now so save that let's make sure okay so it's not bringing in everything let's check it out what happened did we not the update this maybe it was just it was probably keeping the that's really weird that was the old data right maybe it's just caching the old data let's see yeah for some reason that data is getting you still cashed maybe refresh maybe I need to log into WordPress again it looks like no I mean it looks fun that's all I'm not gonna worry about it I mean the data will update eventually usually it updates pretty quickly but anyway we'll check back in a few minutes the next thing is we can pull in some stuff from here and we may need to maybe to see I don't know if I'll need to copy and paste these myself or maybe Amy who handles the content can do this I think they'll probably be some additional things and so we'll see I'm gonna worry about it now but I do want to do the code to be able to pull these in so that they're not hardcoded okay cool um I was thinking I'd have to make a new component but it looks like I already made one so glad about that now I just check the live chat inside the matrix says the Fugees yes the the Fugees that's what I meant so I had I was listening to Lauryn Hill song but it probably was a Fuji song it's just Lauryn Hill does most of the singing let's see I just saw a couple of things in the live chat right now so I'm gonna check it really quick I'm gonna read it out really quick I can see if a few of you remember the Lauren Hill and Fuji song so yeah definitely good songs Jordan asked would it would I miss today we haven't really got that much done today we just kind of went over some of the fixes that I did for some things that were going wrong yesterday and we're just kind of gradually going through and taking a lot of this content that has kind of been hardcoded in and we're instead pulling it from the WordPress API because I would like as much of the site as possible to be editable in WordPress yes Ellie thanks for thanks for asking about the code editor it is Adam so I love it when people ask me about the editor the the theme is the steady theme SCT I also Ellie I don't think that I've seen you in the chat before so welcome sorry if this is not your first time and I just don't remember but welcome to the live chat Manny says sorry I'm late to the party here but did you scrape some content into the JSON I noticed that the quote had tags on the JSON object and I haven't seen that before yeah let me see let me make sure I know exactly what you're referring to let's see and I'm pretty sure you're referring about the JSON that we saw here and let's find it so are you talking about like the HTML tags that are showing up here in if that case if that is true then yeah we are we're getting this content out of WordPress the wordpress api and for the content fields you actually do get all the HTML that's included in those fields as well and it comes through with the json that's why we had to set it with dangerously set enter HTML because up here so that the tags actually rendered as HTML tags instead of just being printed out on the screen because we wouldn't want to see we wouldn't want to see those tags displayed on the screen we want them to be actually evaluated you know by the browser well Jeremy has got an interview tomorrow so it says thanks for the advice awesome really really happy for you so you'll have to let us know how the interview goes hope maybe if the interview is early enough tomorrow would you be able to let us know in tomorrow afternoon's livestream that would be really cool otherwise they can wait till next week but I'm excited so I want to know how it goes haha jonbi says one of these days you should just switch to a different editor just to mess with us actually I love so jahnvi I have an uncle who everybody calls him John be even like his kids call him call him John B or Johnny B sometimes so I I think every time I I see that name and say it there I always think of him all right so let's get back to this and we have a lot done already since we already have these cards made so all we need to do is put some data in there and we'll need C in this case we do we are gonna iterate over the column as well or we want to keep printing the column so we'll go at this point and let's see for a second I thought about doing a similar thing to what we had done on the resources page where you know we have all these different tabs and we're doing some pretty fancy stuff that I think it was fabian had submitted a pull request and did some cool stuff with the tabs and how that gets rendered out but since it's such a small amount of data I think we're fine just to actually render out the things for the for the tabs just right off the bat for both tabs so I think that should work and I don't think it warrants trying to pull in the code from the resources page and replicate what's going on there so for this one we're just going to just do really simply this for our data and we want to filter so everything needs to be filtered since we're pulling in these this big chunk of data that has multiple post types so the first filter we need to put on it is going to filter for the post type so we're gonna do post post type and we want the type that equals post and loose equals post and then after that we're going to do filter it further and we want the post that's gonna have the post a CF type of what is this one announcement and let me check let me check to make sure that that's the value we want yep announcement okay great and the other one is I think news right so our tights for getting announcement in news great okay so announcement and then after we've done that then we can map and go through everything so we're gonna post and for we're gonna grab all of this and on here we're gonna add a key and the key is gonna be our post ID whoops to put that in brackets if you're not familiar with react anything that you put in brackets inside your JSX which is basically this HTML looking stuff here that ends up it's JavaScript it's evaluated as JavaScript so that's why we're pulling in data and putting it in brackets like this okay so our title is going to be post oops title and our content our content is going to be post content rendered and actually I need to put render it up here too and the the reason these all have to be worded like this this is this is just how it comes out from the WordPress API and then for the URL it's going to be I think it's just I'm gonna double check that though all right so let's see oh we call it link now we didn't that's not it that would be the link for WordPress we don't want that link we want I hope we made a field for this because we need it otherwise you're gonna have to make one now mmm well that's no good I'm gonna doublecheck let's check out what it looks like in in WordPress so we have news if I see a description slug and we didn't put in anything for URL so let's make that post right now we'll make that that field no wait a second I remember why we didn't do it now okay because we want these to link to the actual blog post page originally some of them were gonna link to external resources but I don't think we want to do that now we want to we want this to work just like a regular blog so it's gonna link to a blog page alright so forget everything that I was just saying I've lost my mind for a second okay so wish that we're good so the URL then becomes let's see do we want to put this we don't really need the URL we need the slug let me check out the I want to check out this component just to see how what we're doing with that inside the component okay all right so then what we're gonna do is build the URL here and pass the complete URL in there because inside of here you know we're checking for a blank URL we're checking if so we're actually not gonna lame this is probably gonna be unnecessarily Vitt in here just for now just in case but it'll probably unnecessary to check for a blank link because the way we're gonna do it there's never gonna be a blank link but it's okay well no sense in like refactoring in the middle of this if I'm not a hundred percent sure that I'm not gonna use that so for this URL I want to make it I'm gonna use a template literal and I'm gonna say slash news and then so I can go back into JavaScript inside my template literal we need to put a dollar sign and then curly brackets and so now we can put JavaScript in and then I'm gonna say post slug and that's gonna put together that that URL will work because we're using parameterised routing for anything that's on the route of news so it'll just pass the slug along to our template for news which is our single news page template and then it'll use that here it will pass it along as ID so this is really the slug it will use the slug here to make the API call to get just the data that it needs for that particular post so we're good alright so we should be able to save that and I can delete the rest of these and I got a Hootie and the Blowfish is playing right now I totally forgot about them I used to really like Hootie and the Blowfish when I was in grade school we can also copy this now and with only one change use it down here and all what i have to change is this filter and then we can get rid of this and let's save it and refresh restart my search it's getting worse it used to be that I could code for a while without having to restart my dev server and now it's like very frequently oh man my timer ran out I didn't even notice it all right well I guess I'll start the showed up again with the break let's go down here whoa I'll shoot I had thought about that and then I forgot so this I'm actually kind of glad this has happened so this is what happens if you don't dangerous yet enter HTML when you're grabbing stuff from WordPress content the tags actually show up so you can see them there and you can see here the tags are showing up the good thing is what we did worked and it is in fact filtering things into the right spot and also good news is we know exactly how to fix this so let's do that now so we need to go into our text card before since we were manually typing in a string of what we wanted these to be I had never bothered with setting the inner HTML and probably lazily because I always knew this was eventually gonna be populated with other data so I should have just done it before but now we can just grab I'll just grab this I don't even have to type it out again so for the title and the description we want to do this for both of them so I'm gonna put this on the title and on the description and we're gonna change this to this drops title and we're gonna change this one this crops do we call it content I just want to doublecheck yes we did call it content here this props content okay now we can remove this okay we can remove this and let's save it just to make sure it works whoa all right this is I forgot that okay so here's what's happening here in this post I went to pages sorry in this post there's an image I had done this earlier when I was meeting with with Amy who does the content just to show her how to put an image in and I've forgotten about it but what we want to do is we actually don't want that image to show up so here's what I think I think we only want the excerpt to show up here we don't want the full text because it could be really big like this already extends out so let's let's change this so what we want to do we only have to change it here post excerpt and now let's check out wait a second let me check the check this I didn't think the excerpt kept images Oh actually no I don't think I want to keep the excerpt because it adds in this more this more link I don't want that and I know I can change this and the function is a PHP file but I don't want to go through all that so all right I'm gonna go since I had already used up most of my five minutes that I was gonna spend on a live chat I'm gonna go to lunch at now that will give us a minute to think about the best way to address this basically the problem is I don't have enough space here here to put everything so I need a way to just get some of the data also I need to strip out any images because I don't want images in here the simplest way seemed to be to get the excerpt from WordPress instead of the entire content but that's not gonna work because of the more tag so potentially I could use that and then just strip out the more tag either on this end with JavaScript or on the wordpress end with PHP so I'm gonna go back to the live chat and talk for a little bit with you all when we can all think about what the best way to do that is okay I did get a Sarah asked if I'd tried Visual Studio code yeah I have tried Visual Studio code I was using it actually used it on some of my earliest live streams so the ones I did on my own channel before I got invited to stream for free code camp I was using visual studio code on some of those so if you actually want to see me using Visual Studio code go check out some of my my first live streams the I will warn you though the first couple of streams are a little bit rough because the quality I didn't I didn't really have the hang of using OBS yet to do my streaming so the quality is not great and there were some streams where I had no one watching so it's just me talking no interaction with anyone but you will get to see me use Visual Studio code so I think the project I'll be working on after I switched from this one which will be like at the end of next week I think I'm gonna switch back to the project that was working on so I'll probably be switching back to Visual Studio code the reason I use Visual Studio code for that project is because a lot of it is written in csharp and when I tried to load csharp and Adam it didn't automatically highlight things for me but when I loaded it in Visual Studio code it did highlight things really nicely so instead of getting the right plugin for Adam I just used Visual Studio code because that was that was faster and I had been looking for an excuse to try it out anyway and so it was good I I liked it I'm not ready to switch from Adam but I do like it a new path says hi hey how's it going Ali says hi Sabir says hi hey everyone thanks for joining in wow this would already it's already 6 o'clock Wow hey I just checked my phone so a man at 6 o'clock I wonder for my wife's tried to call me she did not try to call me but she did ask me in the text do you know what happened to the sweet Italian sausages and no I don't know what happened to them I hope the dog didn't eat them we recently got a dog against my against my will we got a dog and basically I didn't want a dog because there are a lot of work and I knew that I would probably be doing a lot of the work and I knew that I would fall in love with the dog and there was a good chance that we wouldn't be able to keep the dog because the last time my wife wanted a dog it didn't get along with the kids and so we had to get rid of it it broke my heart so I didn't want my heart broken again but she brought on this dog and the dog loves me sorry for the little tangent but there was no questions in the live chat so I thought I'd just say it so the dog loves me and wants to be around me all the time and the dog hated my wife which was kind of funny because she's the one that really wanted a dog so the dog I mean literally that that if the dog was eating and my wife walked into the room the dog would leave the room wait for my wife to leave and then come back in and resume eating so I did feel bad for my wife because she really wanted that dog so the dog in my wife now get along but now my wife thinks that she's allergic to the dog so I think we're gonna end up getting rid of the dog I feel really bad for the dog because it just changed homes to us and now it's gonna change again and so anyway and then I'm gonna miss the dog so anyway the whole reason I even get onto that is the dog's been eating food off the table so if one of the kids has like a hamburger or something and leaves it on the table and goes in the other room when they come back in the room the hamburger is missing and the plate is clean it's because the dog eats eats all their stuff so now I'm gonna check the live chat really quick and then I'll get back to to what we were doing we'll figure out a solution to our little problem as youngbae said yeah blame it on the dog Jesse it's true I didn't he I only ate one sausage I didn't eat all of them Wow Sebastian scissors after midnight where you were you from Sebastian you probably told me before and I just don't remember alright okay I did have some other questions come in the live chat while I was telling a story about my dog so Jambi yes how long did it take you to learn react and basically anything I really didn't pay that much attention to react until last May so I went to a conference last May and everybody was talking about react and so that's what I really like seriously started thinking like that I need to learn about react because it looks cool I had like I had heard of react before then but my attitude was kind of like oh man another JavaScript framework like well we'll see we'll see if this one is sticks around you know because there's so many frameworks right so basically it's been about a year I haven't I didn't really try to build anything in react until probably like January or May so it wasn't until this year that I actually tried to build something in react I had done some tutorials in react before so I had watched some video tutorials I did the Khan Academy a tutorial for react but I hadn't really successfully built anything until until this this year so sometime in in the early months of 2017 I started like seriously starting to build things and learn more about react so I the first react site that I ever launched like for a client I launched it on April 1st of 2017 so that was my first successful site and so it hasn't really been that long it's kind of surprising now that I think about it that I've I'm building site so when I say like that I really had consider myself to be very new and still learning react like really it hasn't that long so I'm definitely not an expert at it Oh Jeremy's got a see you later Jeremy Jeremy says it's got to go thanks for the videos I'll let you know how my interview goes tomorrow if I catch it all right awesome yeah definitely want to hear about the interview good luck with that and yeah and thanks thanks for watching let me check I'm going to take a few more questions well Sebastian said you can add an excerpt field in WordPress so whoever adds the post can add a little excerpt with no image and then use the real post for the blog post yeah I can oh I'm gonna think about that I got to think I'm not sure if I want I can see pros and cons to that so definitely it would be cool for the content editors to be able to say exactly what they won on the front but it would also be a little bit of extra work I guess they could just copy and paste like the first paragraph if they really wanted to so we'll see maybe maybe although that is I kind of like that I do you know and I think about it more that might be the best solution here sirsir guala says it's five where I'm located cool does that mean like 500 a.m. or 500 p.m. if it's 5 p.m. then you're probably pretty close to my timezone if it's 5 a.m. then you you're probably on the other side of the world I encourage says it's 330 500 a.m. here in India okay cool yeah I mean I usually remember what time it is in India because I've had who is it Rohan always tells me what time it is in India so Rohan must have been asleep for this one usually he stays up to like 200 a.m. India time and I don't know how he does it and on couch how are you up at 335 a.m. watching this I'm glad I'm glad you're watching this thanks for watching but that's crazy all right Sebastian has a cat sitting on his lap right at the moment it's really hot in the house and the hairy cat is not helping yeah is it you know like pets pets and kids always want to like be right next to you when it's hot and like my son my oldest son Raphael like when I go to put him to sleep at night like he'll cuddle up next to me and we'll read a book or something and he'll say like oh I'm so hot and I'm like dude just like you're you're like on top of me you know you can't just scoot over a little bit it's not that I don't you know I don't want to cuddle with him but it's like doesn't help if the body heat is being shared okay Sebastian you're Spain all right awesome oh it's about Sebastian Asif if I saw what he said about what I asked yeah uh obviously I saw that now so I think that is a good idea and I'm probably gonna go with that dyad asks what do you think about the UJS I haven't used UJ s and I haven't learned enough about it to have a good opinion on it so I'm not gonna try to give you an answer that I would just make up what I will say is that I've seen a lot of people talk about it on Twitter so I mean it seems legit just from like the amount of buzz this getting and amount of hype on Twitter and the people that are like legitimate programmers who are using it and saying it's good so I can't say firsthand anything about it but it does seem like it's a legitimate alternative framework Andrew said I started at work to make an admin dashboard and react and react router and fell in love with it that's awesome I'd like to see that I don't know if you're able to share that share a coder there any anything with that or a link but that would be really cool to see Andrew John B says I gotta head out myself to hope you all have a good day have a good day Jesse and see you again sometime soon all right see you John B probably already left so I didn't read that fast enough but in case you're still here see you thanks for joining and contributing in a live chat really appreciate that on couche says I just came in what's the problem we were having okay so here's the problem he came in so basically you can see on the screen it's pulling in I'm pulling in some data but it's pulling in like an image and stuff and I don't want that I basically just want a little bit of text like the first bit of text so I think the solution we're gonna do is I'm gonna make another field for this post so I'll have another field probably up here down here somewhere that's just going to be for the the excerpt right so the content editor is going to type in just a little bit and that's here here and then the real content will appear after you click it will take you to another page and show it all Alberto says without giving it too much thought add a style for the card image to display none yeah actually that's a really good idea that would that would solve the image thing it still wouldn't solve the problem of trying to pool like all the the content but that's a really good idea for like a simple fix okay let me get back to this now that we've we've kind of decided on a solution let's do this I'm gonna make I know that there's an excerpt field that you can add that's like kind of by default comes in WordPress but I'm not going to use that one because I don't know I don't think that'll automatically strip out the tags and I want all the tags stripped out for this part because I don't want people putting like an unordered list or something crazy in here that's gonna throw off my formatting so I'm gonna use the custom fields plugin to make a field I already have the posts field and I'm just gonna add excerpt and the other cool thing I can do with this is that I can put explanatory text so let me make this a text area and I can also limit the characters so let me think how many characters would probably fit there there's anybody good with estimating characters so I wanted to fill up I mean it can go all the way down to here but I don't want it any any more so I wonder if I have all right this is about 30 characters across okay so 300 I'm gonna set a three hundred character limit because it's about 30 characters across and I'm pretty sure I could get at least ten lines on here so 30 or 300 character limit and for the formatting I'm gonna say no formatting so it's not gonna pull in any of the HTML tags for the instructions I'm gonna say give a little bit of instruction and it's just going to be required yes this will be required we need this otherwise we'll get nothing on here and that that'll be no good so not all the posts will appear here I'm just gonna grab the newest post so I won't actually need this for all of them but at some point probably every post will appear here unless unless like more than four posts get added all at the same time all right I'm gonna double check make sure I filled everything in and all right that looks good so let's update and I'm gonna go back to posts and I'm just gonna fill in some of this data so we have something excerpt and I'm gonna grab some lorem ipsum text or maybe I use bacon if some yesterday of the day before what's your favorite lorem ipsum generator I know I've seen a generator for samuel l.jackson it's just like Samuel Epson we could try to use that there's like a there's a generator that uses all like the bad language versions of it and then I think there's another one that just has the quotes that that don't have bad language in it so I think we'll use the stuff without the bad language I I gotta read the quotes first since I'm not you know this is a site for the University I sure don't put it anything crazy up here but this is a quote I think from the movie unbreakable I believe so this will this should work I do want to test out okay so cool so this did work so we have we stopped at 300 characters so that would definitely work out to give us an idea of how much the 300 characters are so let me update this and I need to update our code because we're grabbing the excerpts from the ACF field now and we might end up getting an error I'm just going to try but we'll probably end up getting an error because this field is not going to exist for the some of the posts right now we save not actually safe I just need to restart the dev server hmm well actually this is odd we're still if you notice like this is still the old data and nothing is nothing is updating I don't like that that's really weird wow this is so I haven't blocked this off so that it doesn't display anything this is what the site would look like it's not too bad but it's still showing okay now that is the right data that is still showing why is it not pulling in what we just did right content imposed a CFX oh yeah what's going on that's weird oops I was looking for content I meant excerpt here we go ACF excerpts all right so it's here we see it here okay so what's going on here yeah I'm thinking maybe it is the cash so Sebastian just said cash but the other thing is like I'm not there shouldn't be any cash when I'm running the dev server so I have it set so that the the cash is like one second or something so that shouldn't be the issue and then I haven't set up a cash for the WordPress API and obviously like we're getting the new data in the API as well actually I want to add a new post to okay so you check that out so we got this so it's not an API caching thing but potentially like I guess it could be trying to pull in most ACS excellent are we caching you check my server Dutch AS VAL to make sure i'm not cashing anyone so yeah so it should be yeah so the cache time it looks like I've set it to 100 milliseconds yeah so that that looks like it's set up fine okay so let's open up getting some requests to open up dev tools let's see I think I have it automatically set to disable the cache if dev tools are open so let's see if that fixed it just from being open no but it did freeze my desk for her again alright so we'll start that up again with dev tools open this is one of those unexpected slowdowns that I was worried about let me make sure that I have the cash disabled I can't remember where that what that is anybody remember where that option is in dev tools should I read through all the ones make sure I'm not missing it maybe it's somewhere else let me check oh that's in the network tab okay sorry I wasn't looking over there yeah okay cool I did have disabled cash checks I thought I always did keep that off it's such a huge here's what's weird to me so we've definitely now I know what happened man if you haven't already figured it out oh I feel so silly now okay so we only changed it here right our this is behaving exactly as we told it to behave because it's still being told to pull the content rendered for the announcements oh man see this there we go that's what we need all right that's it and that's pretty much perfect as far as the length goes we could increase it a bit so I can maybe go like three owner we could probably fit another line in there I don't want it to look too crowded at the bottom so maybe I can go like two 320 characters who ever really wanted to but I don't think that's a big deal we'll see if that's really something that's necessary I can increase it a bit okay so so this works and actually the cool thing is I wasn't getting errors I was I was thinking I may get an error because that field wouldn't exist at all in ACF but it seems like we're not getting the error at least it's not causing it man these things are coming from looks like we're not giving something in it a key somewhere so we need to figure out what's not getting the key and they say Oh since you won 34 in the blockquote that's weird because we're we're only pulling one thing maybe it still wants a key even though it's one thing so we give that a key these are caused by the YouTube embed so the YouTube embed seems to be working so I guess I'm not gonna worry about these is there any special thing that needs to happen with YouTube embeds and react that's gonna mess up the site if so you know about it please let me know otherwise I'll just kind of let it go and make sure that I test out that homepage on different browsers so let's put in the key and wish do like we've been doing and say post id loose post id and we can check to make sure I guess I didn't refresh great okay so we don't have that error anymore oh so let's I'm just going to go ahead so we've been working on this for a while and how long were you doing this I have at least done probably four Pomodoro sessions so far I've been streaming for what like two hours I want to say at least three or four I'm gonna say I've done three more sessions so I'm gonna bump that up to six because I have done some a little bit of talking so three sessions I'm glad that I estimated it at 13 because I'll probably need most of that time although we as we run into and figure out you know some of these issues it'll make each successive page a bit easier but anyway a home page just looking at looking decent now so this is everything that we wanted to do for the home page well with the exception of this what the heck is going on with this let's double check let's check this again for some reason oh you know what why is this a quote let's change this so I think I put I think I took out the normal editor and I put in this custom field here and that's probably what's messing things up because the original data probably had this in it and nothing else yeah so that's what's go into our custom fields and yep home barriner fields and we had the quote in alright so let's let's just get rid of that because I don't think we need yeah we don't need that this should work without it better to just simplify it if we don't need it now let's go back to the pages we'll see what's going on and if I'm correct yep there we go so once again it's doing exactly what we told it to do I was just confused about what I was telling it to do so let me grab what I have it I still have the development server open which does have the text that I want so I'll grab it from there here and then let's make sure yeah I want to get rid of that data JSX cuz that'll mess things up and update now we'll be able to see what it really looks like and if it's it's gonna look how we want it to look man this dev server is like stopping so often it might be faster to just not have hot module reloading and manually refresh the page alright cool so this is working this is how we wanted it to look awesome so that's the home page done and I forgot to start up my my timer again no let's I'm gonna commit this check out the status okay so we've edited what do we do the about I don't remember what we did to the about page it's probably just some sort of Auto formatting thing that that happened so I'm not gonna worry about it Oh enough to remember to push all these changes to the the dev server so you all can see this I'll try to remember to do that before I leave today okay so we've got the home page getting the data that we want from the API I'm gonna check the live chat and then I'm have to decide whether I want to keep working or go home since it's after 630 p.m. my time so it's definitely beyond the point at which I normally go home I've been here since 930 a.m. and I worked through my lunch break alright so I'm gonna scroll up a bit so you see what I missed okay Sara showed there's a Bible Epsom Oh seriously that that would actually be perfect for this site I'm gonna look that up on my other screen that would be way more appropriate than Samuel Jackson Epsom for this site like I wouldn't mind it for like a side project but oh really cool awesome all right cool I'm definitely gonna use the Bible if some now when I need lorem ipsum text the rest of the site I think the people who are in charge of catechetical Institute would appreciate that much more than the samuel l.jackson or even the bacon ipsum as awesome as that is okay it looks like some of you were asking about like to see things in dev tools and stuff but I think that was in reference to the problem we're having and sorted that all out it was basically just my fault and not changing what I needed to change so birdperson asked and this was maybe 20 minutes ago so sorry for getting back to you a little later but very person as Jesse can you advise starting point to study react what you read watch Thanks so my advice would be to watch just to get an idea of like the the whole philosophy behind react there's some videos you can watch from like the react conf like Facebook's react conference what do they call is it just called react conf I can't remember now but if you check out the react like the Facebook developers YouTube or something I can't remember what it is now what the YouTube channel is for sure but check out like some of the keynote addresses where they explain the reasoning behind it that's kind of cool you don't need to know that to know react but it's kind of cool to get in the mindset of like why why even make another framework you know what's this for so that's kind of cool some of the talks will be like way over your head some of the socks are still over my head so you know probably don't need to watch them all there's some stuff about react on will stern has a YouTube channel called learn code Academy I think that's that's what is called so he has some react stuff that's good the videos are a little bit older but they still work for an introduction to react the react documentation on like the official react website is pretty good code Academy has like an inbrowser react tutorial that you can go through this kind of nice because you don't need to know how to set up any development environments so that will be helpful and I think what else free code camp I haven't checked out the react section in a while I'm not sure that the react section is actually finished for like the the official courses right now the official challenges but the beta version of the challenges I think has more react stuff in it I I haven't checked that in a while so I can't say for sure so that those resources are what I would probably check out I think you could probably get some idea of what's going on and react from some of my past streams but my streams aren't exactly like a tutorial so that might be useful like if you were working on something else and just wanted to play it in the background and just like watch when something was happening that was useful that might be it might be helpful to you otherwise like it wouldn't be really efficient to try to watch my streams to actually learn anything because there's so much other stuff going on that it's not focused enough so you'll you will probably learn stuff but it'll be all over the place most of the time and the streams are brief can be really long so anyway I hope at least some of those resources are helpful to you and all right also I recommend starting out with something like an XJS or create react app just to help you get started building something oh also too if if you if you have money to spend on trying to learn react Udacity has a good react course they just started and I'm I'm taking the course right now and I've been impressed with it so far but the course is 500 dollars like so like in US dollars it's 500 dollars so not sure you know how much you want to spend on react but that that course has been good so far from me let's see okay it looks like Andrew sent an image I'm assuming this is of the admin panel that you made in react we'll find out in a second I'm going to open up on my other screen here and just say oops I say I think I put left this space in there there we go that's weird so anyway Andrew I tried to check out that image and it's it's giving me the error the error page for imager so Sara said in response to bird person's question about react the try level up tux or level up I'm not sure how you pronounce it it's level up to UTS which is supposed to be short for tutorials but I always look at it and want to say level up tuts and so I'm not sure how are you supposed to pronounce it yeah okay thanks everyone for trying to try to help out with the air I was having I can see now on the chat that you were all kind of asking about it but sorry about the silly mistake on my part okay so Patrick had a link that looks like it's gonna be useful so I'm gonna open this on my other screen real quick and if maybe I'll pull it over under my main screen so I get why they don't let you put links in the live chat but it ends up being annoying to have to copy and paste them and then take out the spaces and stuff so anyway this is the resource that patrick has just put in the live chat for learning react so this is the react redux length on github so it looks like it has a lot of nice stuff for getting started tutorials so nice that's that's this looks really good Patrick so thanks for this so this should be helpful to anyone it looks like to anyone starting out or at any level of trying to learn react this is really cool I'm definitely gonna star this hey I already started cool does that ever happen anyone else you find this really awesome github repo and then you go to start and you realize that you've already started at some point I need to go back and look through this stuff I've starred I'm sure I'll find useful stuff there that I've completely forgotten about but this one looks good it looks like it's it's kept up to date like I mean look this two days ago it was updated so that's cool sometimes you see nice lists like this but they're a little outdated but this one is kept up so thanks Patrick okay Sara also says for in terms of react courses also if you don't mind paying try West boss calm so yeah I've never taken any courses from there I've seen maybe on Twitter i'm not i don't remember where I've seen it maybe an advertisement or something for that so but I can't really say personally anything about it because I haven't haven't taken any any courses okay Sebastian says if you use map you need a key so since I used earlier I was getting the air that I needed a key but it was even it was on this block quote and I'm only pulling one thing for the block but quote but since I was using map I still needed the key which that makes sense I don't mind putting the key on there that will help me get used to putting the key in there all the time which I frequently forget to do so maybe if I make myself do it enough times I'll remember it Sebastien says by the way you get the solution to the warning in the warning itself yeah I know usually react is really good about providing really useful warnings thanks you wanna check that out now and actually didn't read this frameborder oh that's why thanks for saying that Sebastian because now I realized that I should have just read this oh man okay so let's just fix this right now I feel so so silly right now that I didn't just take three seconds to actually read that warning so basically in react it wants me to camelcase this let me see what's this when it wants allowfullscreen okay wants me to camelcase these I gotten lazy with this stuff because I have a NPM module that actually lets me use like class instead of class name and things like that but I guess it doesn't convert stuff like this let's see yeah it looks like I think this is new stuff here so it looks like it went away I I do want to double check just want to see that nice clean clean screen there yeah all right check it out now we only have I should get rid of this console log and this console ugh I'm gonna do that right now cuz otherwise I'll forget I think that's in analytic that's both in the analytics okay so I don't need this and I don't need this that now we're those the heirs all right those are the areas that I get when my my dev server fails all right so next time I see those errors I'm not just gonna get rid of them actually gonna read them and try to figure out what is going on but at least I won't it won't be quite so cluttered now that I've gotten rid of some of the logs okay Patrick says +14 west boss he's awesome okay so maybe that that resources we got two people in the live chat now recommending that resource so maybe I'll have to check it out I don't have time to take on another course right now since I'm already doing one well I'm already doing free code camp and Udacity on top of my other work and taking care of all my kids so maybe when I finish up with one of the things then I can do check out west boss how's the pricing on that is it like really expensive or you know compared to a lot of other courses okay Andrews asking about the Pomodoro Technique and the stuff in Trello I explained it like in more depth early in the stream so if you can check out the recording like you'll get a better explanation but basically the numbers in Trello or the number of Pomodoro sessions that each task takes so a Pomodoro session is 25 minutes so every 25 minutes I take a fiveminute break after four sessions I take a 10minute break it helps break up the work and it helps to more accurately estimate the time the tasks take so the the dark numbers in Trello or how many Pomodoro sessions I think it's going to take and the lighter numbers are how many it actually took me to do I see now that Sara already answered Andrews it's thanks there sorry I didn't see that I was anyway those those two cadets and Patrick answered as well to man ten as what software are you using for your dev server basically it's just like it's web pack but it I don't have to customize it myself because next Jas is automatically running it so that's part of the reason why I haven't even dug into the issue because I I didn't need to set it up myself so I know like I'm gonna have to learn how it was set up before I can even try to fix it so but basically it is web pack though Sebastian says I think you have some more posts with data JSX I think you're right because I was copy and pasting earlier in the day and I didn't remove that so I'm gonna have to go back and doublecheck everything well Andrew says in my country for West bust courses I get a 52% discount that's sweet wit what country are you from Andrew you probably told me before so sorry I don't I don't remember but we'll see if you if that 52% is a big discount it might be worth moving for I'm just joking it probably wouldn't be but maybe if you're gonna take enough courses Manny says have you tried fetching from Component did mount and saving your data in your app state object yeah I actually do that on some of the pages some of the components but the thing is with with next J s you if you want it to be able to render serverside you have to fetch the data from in here from get initial props so what I do if I want to put it into state is I end up in component did mount transferring the data into state so I still grab it here and it still goes to props first and then it goes into state and then I can you know manipulate the data use it after at that point so on this page I really don't have any need to save it the state because I'm not like I don't ever need to change it to make things rerender or happen so but on on some pages like the resource page I do I am doing that but it still I still grab everything initially with this get initial props just for the sake of the serverside rendering okay Manny says you Demi's modern react and redux is very awesome for starting out a very awesome course so albury person says thank you Jesse for the advice you're welcome I hope some of it is helpful to you and make sure like if you can come back some other live chats and let us know like how it's going and what resources you found helpful I think that would be awesome it'd be helpful for me and I'm sure would probably be helpful for some other people that are that are watching Manny says learn a lot from you awesome I'm glad I'm but glad that I could be helpful a lot of times I feel like I'm not really being helpful to you all you are teaching me a lot so it's nice when sometimes I I'm doing the teaching a little bit all right so Andrew posted the link again yeah me maybe I thought I got rid of all the spaces let me try it again yeah it did work I must have just left the space in there and didn't realize it oh very cool that's really cool Andrew I'm checking out on my other screen I don't know if you want me to show it to everybody in the live stream or not so that's why I open it on the other stream or the other screen that's really cool I like that yeah so if if anyone is sharing any of their own work by default I will just open it on another screen in case you don't want everybody to be able to see it in the stream you know and in the recording but if you don't mind that just let me know when you give me the link and then I can as long as it's appropriate if nobody's ever tried to share anything inappropriate but as long as it's appropriate I'll put it up there that's also another reason why I open it on a separate screen just on on the off chance that someone would happen to post something inappropriate actually that link the Heroku link is it's not working for me it's saying access denied for me why is it saying what are Y saying asketh access denied when I try to put the link in okay I see you posted another link a little a little bit after okay ceressus 72 and 98 so I assume that's in response to my question about the pricing for for West boss and Manny also recommends West boss okay that's not too bad actually oh yeah that's a decent price so 72 dollars 98 so it seems like West boss is the way to go I might even have to check that out I mean like I said I there's no way I could do another course right now but I'll keep that in mind for the future okay Andrew says Moldova cool so you're from so I have three three of my wife's cousins were adopted from Moldova so that's what I remember when they were adopted they were just really little and could barely speak English or anything and I remember visiting with my wife's and uncle and they live they live in a different state so went down there and stayed with them for like a week and helped out with the kids and everything it was cool when now the kids are like they're teenagers so it makes me feel old but anyway that's cool and I I get I know people from Moldova okay rich Rishabh I'm not sure I pronounce a so sorry but rich a vas hey I just came to this live video I want to know how we can link with react I want to know that suit actually says so in this video I'm actually linking WordPress with react through the WordPress API so I'm not dealing with a database directly there's like the WordPress API is sitting between the database and it's a different kind so I mean WordPress uses a sequel database which is definitely different than so at some point it's likely that I will do something that uses a database with react but I can't I can't guarantee when that project will happen so so I can't answer your question right now unfortunately but I hope that in the future I can do more streams with with and react okay see you later mani mandis gotta head out thanks thanks for watching I know you're contributing in the latch at Patrick says in response to the question about DB says I would expect you would want to write a backend service in something like no tour Express to provide endpoints for interacting with MongoDB yeah that's actually that's a really good answer so I mean that would be you know that wanting in specifics of how you do that that I mean that would be the way to go you obviously you wouldn't be reacting like you wouldn't be going directly from reacts like clientside directly to a database most likely you would have some sort of I get would you call that a middleware I don't know but but your backend node Express would be interacting with the database and then sending that so yes Sebastian says sorry about the language change Sebastian just started talking in another language in the live chat or typing in another language birdperson says thank you very much Jessy I was glad to spent this time with FCC campers jordan says shouldn't you be going home Jessie yeah I should I was just thinking the same thing so anyway you're welcome birdperson so yeah I'm glad you spent time with us as well so yeah anyway I think I am gonna wrap it up cuz it's 700 and I need to go home and put my kids to sleep so yeah so I kinda hope to get a little bit more done but unfortunately I did have some silly issues that came up and we're entirely just my fault for not paying attention more closely to my code so I need to commit those last couple changes we made to get rid of the errors and that's about it I'm going to commit that I'm going to push everything up to the dev server and I might check the dev server to make sure it does it quits just shutting down and then that way at least it'll be open to anyone who wants to see it and then I'll I'll be here tomorrow morning and I'll do some more work and I'll see you all tomorrow I'm pretty sure that I can do the stream at the normal time tomorrow I have a meeting with a potential client at 500 p.m. so it won't be a super long stream but I could probably do like an hour hour and a half stream and still have enough time to make it to the meeting so anyway it was it was cool I'm glad I got to do this and death see some different people probably because of the different you know time that I strained that so tomorrow it'll be at the normal time most likely 2 p.m. Eastern time thank you so much everyone for watching and for helping out and in the live chat is really awesome and really cool just working on this project you you all have been like kind of with this project for the whole time you know pretty much from the beginning so this is very much like I think our project together and it's really cool so I can't wait to like be done with it and move on but then you know have this entire project from start to finish like all livestreamed I think that's that's gonna be really cool so anyway good night everybody at least in my timezone good night and have a great night I'll see y'all tomorrow
