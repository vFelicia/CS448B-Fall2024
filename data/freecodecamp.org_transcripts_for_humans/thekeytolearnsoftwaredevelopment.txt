00:00 - one of the hardest things on your path
00:02 - to becoming a developer and learning to
00:04 - code is
00:05 - consistency this is probably the
00:08 - number one thing people would say when
00:10 - learning code is it's about
00:12 - repetition it's about doing it every day
00:13 - it's about working at it um again and
00:16 - again and again and um you know if you
00:18 - don't take any breaks you're gonna get
00:20 - there much quicker than if you do take
00:21 - breaks and so consistency is something
00:23 - that a lot of people struggle with in
00:25 - all aspects of their life so i'm gonna
00:26 - talk to you about five ways that when i
00:28 - was learning to be a self-taught dev
00:31 - i i
00:33 - made sure that i was able to code every
00:34 - day i was consistent with my my learning
00:37 - and that i was able to finally uh just
00:41 - get it right and just finally
00:43 - grab and understand oh my god it's
00:45 - starting to click these are things that
00:46 - i made sure so that i had a consistent
00:48 - path
00:51 - [Music]
00:58 - so the first thing is about getting rid
01:00 - of distractions eliminating things
01:02 - oftentimes
01:03 - you are trying to make a career change
01:05 - you are trying to make a life change and
01:08 - uh learning code and all those things so
01:10 - it's a it's a big change and you need to
01:13 - sort of refactor some of your life to
01:14 - make to make it a change that will
01:17 - actually last and so you need to start
01:19 - getting rid of distractions as that's
01:21 - really the first thing that i did and
01:24 - those were a couple different categories
01:25 - of distractions and um you know some of
01:27 - you may disagree say you know dylan
01:30 - i don't want to get rid of all that it
01:32 - sounds like you're getting rid of all
01:33 - the fun right uh well you have to
01:35 - understand when you're when you're
01:36 - taking on uh you know a career change or
01:38 - a
01:39 - life change
01:40 - your your life and career are changing
01:42 - and you need to reflect that so um for
01:45 - me i personally sold all my game systems
01:47 - like i always had an issue where i
01:48 - couldn't
01:49 - i say couldn't i didn't have the
01:51 - self-control to have a game console in
01:54 - the house
01:55 - and not play it when i should be coding
01:57 - when i should be going to a meetup when
01:59 - i should be reading um
02:01 - a book about software
02:03 - so that's the first things and that's
02:04 - more than just you know physical items
02:07 - in the house uh if you watch a ton of tv
02:09 - sell your tv
02:11 - uh sell your game systems um surround
02:14 - yourself with like-minded individuals as
02:15 - well right so one thing that i had to do
02:18 - was i had to stop hanging out with my
02:19 - friends who were you know losers
02:21 - essentially and uh losers in the sense
02:23 - that
02:24 - they you know they just want to go out
02:26 - drink every night and you know they were
02:28 - okay going and working their you know
02:30 - minimum wage job in the morning and
02:32 - that's if that's what you want to do but
02:34 - to me that's not those aren't the people
02:36 - are going to help me become a better
02:38 - developer
02:39 - so surround yourself with people who are
02:41 - trying to who are developers are trying
02:43 - to be better developers and slowly those
02:45 - distractions whether they be friends
02:48 - whether they be game consoles in my case
02:51 - uh will slowly
02:53 - weave them out because you're going to
02:54 - be changing as a person but you can in
02:57 - the in the short term you can get rid of
02:58 - the stuff that you don't need uh that
03:00 - are just items relatively quickly
03:03 - number two is um pretty much setting a
03:05 - schedule
03:07 - setting a schedule um the uh the the
03:10 - thing here is
03:12 - it is very easy to say that you are
03:13 - going to
03:15 - you know work hard every day but what
03:17 - does that mean what does that really
03:18 - mean and when you have a schedule you
03:21 - are forcing yourself into a situation
03:23 - where
03:24 - no matter what from the hours of 7 a.m
03:26 - to 8 a.m i'm going to be doing an hour
03:28 - of something from the hours of you know
03:31 - 7 p.m to 9 00 p.m every night i give
03:33 - those examples because those are the
03:34 - hours that i work um on my youtube
03:37 - channel on my courses
03:39 - on becoming a better developer
03:41 - in the same hours that i worked when i
03:43 - was learning to code before i was a
03:45 - developer because you know most of us
03:47 - probably aren't self-employed probably
03:50 - aren't uh independently wealthy so we
03:52 - have to find the time and
03:54 - when you find the time you know so far
03:56 - we've eliminated the distractions which
03:58 - in theory should create the time so that
04:00 - we can stick to our schedule
04:02 - and
04:03 - it's hard to do but it is one of the
04:07 - ways to stick with being consistent to
04:09 - consistently work hard and
04:12 - you'll continue to make progress if you
04:14 - do that
04:15 - now tip number three is having clearly
04:18 - defined milestones now what does that
04:20 - really mean
04:22 - in reality what we're really talking
04:23 - about is having goals and knowing when
04:25 - you have accomplished those goals it's
04:28 - very easy to
04:29 - have one goal right i want to be a
04:32 - developer dylan that's my one and only
04:34 - goal okay well what are the goals you
04:36 - need to achieve to accomplish that goal
04:38 - right
04:39 - goal number one
04:41 - set up a github right all right cool i
04:43 - set up a github i have a new project
04:45 - cool a little baby milestone first
04:47 - project on github awesome you have a
04:49 - linkedin cool you've worked on your
04:50 - linkedin you've got it out there oh
04:52 - you've built your personal portfolio
04:53 - site in react in angular whatever it is
04:55 - if you're a frontend dev back in dev but
04:57 - you built some project all these little
04:59 - goals and milestones understand what it
05:01 - is that you want to accomplish if your
05:03 - end goal is to become a front-end
05:05 - developer you need to have
05:07 - 10
05:08 - mini goals on your path to getting there
05:11 - that include all the languages you need
05:13 - to be familiar with the framework that
05:14 - you want to learn the projects that
05:15 - you're building in that framework
05:17 - etc etc etc not only will
05:20 - it give you a better idea and a learning
05:22 - path that you need to have a lot of
05:24 - times it gets very overwhelming
05:26 - especially in the the web dev world
05:28 - because there's new stuff coming out oh
05:30 - should i learn view should you know
05:31 - python django what what what should i
05:34 - learn
05:35 - you can do your own research on that but
05:37 - what you need to do is after you've done
05:39 - your research after you've talked with
05:41 - your mentor after you've you know
05:42 - watched videos read blogs
05:45 - you need to define that path on how to
05:48 - get to your end goal and those many
05:50 - milestones you get there not only will
05:52 - it keep you motivated because you'll see
05:55 - like oh i'm getting closer because
05:57 - you're either going zero to a hundred if
05:58 - your only goal here is to be a dev
06:01 - you're going to feel like you're at zero
06:02 - until you're a hundred and that's very
06:03 - demotivating so you need to have those
06:05 - clearly
06:06 - clearly defined goals and also give you
06:08 - the confidence for when you are ready to
06:10 - start throwing out those job
06:12 - applications when you are ready to start
06:14 - saying you know what
06:16 - i'm ready let's go interview right let's
06:18 - go start submitting those resumes let's
06:20 - start doing those technical interviews
06:22 - those those phone screens
06:24 - so those clearly defined goals are going
06:25 - to be what allow you to stay motivated
06:28 - and it's a little it's nice all right
06:29 - i'm you know i'm one step closer so
06:31 - that's something that i think is a big
06:33 - deal that you need to have set up in in
06:34 - your learning path to stay consistent
06:37 - all right this may come as a little bit
06:39 - of a uh like well didn't you just say
06:41 - you need to get rid of those distracting
06:43 - friends well yes
06:44 - but you need to expose your process to
06:48 - other people
06:49 - so that they're on the same page and
06:51 - that doesn't mean that i'm telling you
06:52 - to kick out your mother kick out your
06:54 - brother from your life or anything like
06:55 - that or your kids because you know they
06:57 - take up your time and energy to a degree
07:00 - but for those people who you're like you
07:03 - know they're not a negative in influence
07:05 - on me but they do they are time right if
07:08 - you have kids you need to watch them you
07:09 - know your husband or your wife you know
07:11 - while you're out learning that's taking
07:13 - energy away from the family and so
07:15 - everyone needs to be on the same page
07:16 - right
07:17 - one thing that i did
07:19 - when i was living with my mother and i
07:21 - was coding is i had a sign and i
07:24 - basically did the pomodoro technique for
07:26 - except i did about hours so if you're
07:27 - not familiar with pomodoro technique you
07:29 - work then you take a break for a certain
07:30 - amount so typically people do about 30
07:32 - minutes and then they take a 10 minute
07:34 - break so uh what i did was i worked for
07:36 - about an hour and my mother loved her
07:39 - death she'd always be knocking on the
07:40 - door hey you want anything to eat you
07:41 - know hey can you help me move the couch
07:44 - all this sort of stuff not that she's
07:45 - trying to bother me but this is you know
07:47 - when you are coding you need to get into
07:49 - a groove right you need to
07:52 - you need to be able to
07:54 - sit down
07:55 - and 50 it might take you 15 20 minutes
07:57 - to ramp up and then you get 40 minutes
07:59 - productivity in an hour everyone's
08:00 - different but um if you let the people
08:03 - in your life know that okay well you
08:04 - know
08:05 - you let your children know if daddy has
08:07 - this sign on the door says um you know
08:09 - busy learning or whatever it is don't
08:11 - come in you know go ask mommy and then
08:13 - you have 40 minutes and you just have
08:15 - people respect that and then in my case
08:17 - i would put on the door and i come out
08:18 - and say hey mom is there anything you
08:19 - need you know april anything i can help
08:21 - you with whatever it may be and reach
08:24 - out to them but it is important that
08:25 - people understand because they they may
08:27 - not right uh my mother to this day still
08:29 - thinks i'm just in there playing video
08:31 - games right she thinks i'm just in there
08:33 - playing starcraft um
08:35 - uh you know that's what she's so but she
08:37 - did respect the fact that i you know set
08:40 - some boundaries to a degree and and said
08:42 - hey you know what i'm i'm i'm just
08:45 - trying to learn here i'm trying to
08:46 - better myself and to do that i need i
08:49 - need to be able to focus i need the time
08:52 - that it is required to accomplish that
08:55 - and when you when you've set those those
08:57 - boundaries other people are on the same
08:59 - page and then you you also feel a sense
09:01 - of pride because now people know what
09:03 - you're trying to accomplish and now it's
09:05 - like oh well i don't want to let moms
09:07 - down i don't want to let the girlfriend
09:08 - down whatever maybe the husband down um
09:11 - so i i encourage you to explain your
09:13 - process and get people to be on the same
09:16 - page as you
09:18 - last but not least is a little bit more
09:19 - of a
09:20 - flexible be flexible with yourself um a
09:23 - lot of what was talking about scheduling
09:26 - having organized goals
09:28 - um being able to to inform people of you
09:31 - know how can they work within your
09:34 - system so that everyone's on the same
09:35 - page you get the time you need but being
09:37 - flexible with yourself is probably the
09:39 - number one thing that you
09:41 - need to understand to a degree right
09:44 - what do i mean by being flexible with
09:45 - yourself well
09:47 - if you're trying to learn to code or
09:49 - even you're a developer you're just
09:50 - trying to get better and you're saying
09:52 - look man i'm already a developer i want
09:53 - to go from junior to senior and i want
09:55 - to do it in a year
09:56 - i want to build i want to write a book i
09:57 - want to build a course whatever it is um
10:00 - there's going to be days where you don't
10:01 - want to do it there's going to be days
10:03 - where you're tired um you know you just
10:06 - got off work your boss just verbally
10:09 - abused you right whatever it is um you
10:12 - know your boyfriend dumped you your
10:13 - girlfriend
10:14 - uh is cheating on you whatever it may be
10:17 - right there's going to be days where
10:18 - you're just in a
10:20 - awful place
10:21 - could nothing could happen you're just
10:23 - tired you're not bored um you're stuck
10:25 - on something and for those days it's
10:27 - okay take a break no but it is okay
10:31 - to
10:32 - change your attitude and change
10:35 - how you're going to refocus yourself so
10:37 - if you've been hacking away on a project
10:39 - and you've just hit
10:40 - something and you're you're at a wall
10:42 - how can you continue your learning path
10:44 - how can you continue to be consistent
10:46 - within your schedule well you can um you
10:48 - can read some blogs for instance learn
10:50 - about stuff you can watch you know a
10:51 - two-hour talk on es6 es7 whatever it is
10:54 - whatever you're interested in
10:57 - you can go to hackathons you can go to
10:58 - meetups have all this sort of stuff
11:00 - where
11:01 - you know go hang out with a friend who
11:04 - hopefully is a developer and you know do
11:06 - some pair programming
11:08 - do some just change it up is what i'm
11:10 - trying to say for those days that you're
11:12 - like
11:13 - god man i just i'm tired like i love
11:15 - this i love this but i'm so tired today
11:19 - and i don't want to do it well
11:22 - do something else that's still going to
11:23 - help you accomplish those milestones
11:25 - it's going to make you a better
11:26 - developer and make you stay on the path
11:29 - right because
11:30 - the thing is is every time every day
11:32 - even if it feels like the tiniest of
11:34 - steps your that consistency is moving
11:36 - you one step closer to your goal a one
11:39 - step closer to the milestone you know
11:41 - each one of these milestones are like a
11:42 - gas station we're just filling up again
11:44 - before you get to your final destination
11:47 - and that consistency through all of it
11:48 - is really what you're going to need to
11:50 - succeed in any aspect of your software
11:52 - career and i highly encourage you to try
11:54 - and keep it fun keep it fresh and keep
11:56 - it consistent because consistency will
11:58 - be what takes you to the next level of
12:00 - your career wherever they may be but uh
12:03 - anyhow guys that's my five tips on how
12:04 - to be consistent how to work hard
12:06 - essentially and stay on the path uh
12:08 - whatever your path may be so i hope you
12:10 - found it helpful thank you for watching
12:12 - the video and check out my channel
12:14 - sometime i guess

Cleaned transcript:

one of the hardest things on your path to becoming a developer and learning to code is consistency this is probably the number one thing people would say when learning code is it's about repetition it's about doing it every day it's about working at it um again and again and again and um you know if you don't take any breaks you're gonna get there much quicker than if you do take breaks and so consistency is something that a lot of people struggle with in all aspects of their life so i'm gonna talk to you about five ways that when i was learning to be a selftaught dev i i made sure that i was able to code every day i was consistent with my my learning and that i was able to finally uh just get it right and just finally grab and understand oh my god it's starting to click these are things that i made sure so that i had a consistent path so the first thing is about getting rid of distractions eliminating things oftentimes you are trying to make a career change you are trying to make a life change and uh learning code and all those things so it's a it's a big change and you need to sort of refactor some of your life to make to make it a change that will actually last and so you need to start getting rid of distractions as that's really the first thing that i did and those were a couple different categories of distractions and um you know some of you may disagree say you know dylan i don't want to get rid of all that it sounds like you're getting rid of all the fun right uh well you have to understand when you're when you're taking on uh you know a career change or a life change your your life and career are changing and you need to reflect that so um for me i personally sold all my game systems like i always had an issue where i couldn't i say couldn't i didn't have the selfcontrol to have a game console in the house and not play it when i should be coding when i should be going to a meetup when i should be reading um a book about software so that's the first things and that's more than just you know physical items in the house uh if you watch a ton of tv sell your tv uh sell your game systems um surround yourself with likeminded individuals as well right so one thing that i had to do was i had to stop hanging out with my friends who were you know losers essentially and uh losers in the sense that they you know they just want to go out drink every night and you know they were okay going and working their you know minimum wage job in the morning and that's if that's what you want to do but to me that's not those aren't the people are going to help me become a better developer so surround yourself with people who are trying to who are developers are trying to be better developers and slowly those distractions whether they be friends whether they be game consoles in my case uh will slowly weave them out because you're going to be changing as a person but you can in the in the short term you can get rid of the stuff that you don't need uh that are just items relatively quickly number two is um pretty much setting a schedule setting a schedule um the uh the the thing here is it is very easy to say that you are going to you know work hard every day but what does that mean what does that really mean and when you have a schedule you are forcing yourself into a situation where no matter what from the hours of 7 a.m to 8 a.m i'm going to be doing an hour of something from the hours of you know 7 p.m to 9 00 p.m every night i give those examples because those are the hours that i work um on my youtube channel on my courses on becoming a better developer in the same hours that i worked when i was learning to code before i was a developer because you know most of us probably aren't selfemployed probably aren't uh independently wealthy so we have to find the time and when you find the time you know so far we've eliminated the distractions which in theory should create the time so that we can stick to our schedule and it's hard to do but it is one of the ways to stick with being consistent to consistently work hard and you'll continue to make progress if you do that now tip number three is having clearly defined milestones now what does that really mean in reality what we're really talking about is having goals and knowing when you have accomplished those goals it's very easy to have one goal right i want to be a developer dylan that's my one and only goal okay well what are the goals you need to achieve to accomplish that goal right goal number one set up a github right all right cool i set up a github i have a new project cool a little baby milestone first project on github awesome you have a linkedin cool you've worked on your linkedin you've got it out there oh you've built your personal portfolio site in react in angular whatever it is if you're a frontend dev back in dev but you built some project all these little goals and milestones understand what it is that you want to accomplish if your end goal is to become a frontend developer you need to have 10 mini goals on your path to getting there that include all the languages you need to be familiar with the framework that you want to learn the projects that you're building in that framework etc etc etc not only will it give you a better idea and a learning path that you need to have a lot of times it gets very overwhelming especially in the the web dev world because there's new stuff coming out oh should i learn view should you know python django what what what should i learn you can do your own research on that but what you need to do is after you've done your research after you've talked with your mentor after you've you know watched videos read blogs you need to define that path on how to get to your end goal and those many milestones you get there not only will it keep you motivated because you'll see like oh i'm getting closer because you're either going zero to a hundred if your only goal here is to be a dev you're going to feel like you're at zero until you're a hundred and that's very demotivating so you need to have those clearly clearly defined goals and also give you the confidence for when you are ready to start throwing out those job applications when you are ready to start saying you know what i'm ready let's go interview right let's go start submitting those resumes let's start doing those technical interviews those those phone screens so those clearly defined goals are going to be what allow you to stay motivated and it's a little it's nice all right i'm you know i'm one step closer so that's something that i think is a big deal that you need to have set up in in your learning path to stay consistent all right this may come as a little bit of a uh like well didn't you just say you need to get rid of those distracting friends well yes but you need to expose your process to other people so that they're on the same page and that doesn't mean that i'm telling you to kick out your mother kick out your brother from your life or anything like that or your kids because you know they take up your time and energy to a degree but for those people who you're like you know they're not a negative in influence on me but they do they are time right if you have kids you need to watch them you know your husband or your wife you know while you're out learning that's taking energy away from the family and so everyone needs to be on the same page right one thing that i did when i was living with my mother and i was coding is i had a sign and i basically did the pomodoro technique for except i did about hours so if you're not familiar with pomodoro technique you work then you take a break for a certain amount so typically people do about 30 minutes and then they take a 10 minute break so uh what i did was i worked for about an hour and my mother loved her death she'd always be knocking on the door hey you want anything to eat you know hey can you help me move the couch all this sort of stuff not that she's trying to bother me but this is you know when you are coding you need to get into a groove right you need to you need to be able to sit down and 50 it might take you 15 20 minutes to ramp up and then you get 40 minutes productivity in an hour everyone's different but um if you let the people in your life know that okay well you know you let your children know if daddy has this sign on the door says um you know busy learning or whatever it is don't come in you know go ask mommy and then you have 40 minutes and you just have people respect that and then in my case i would put on the door and i come out and say hey mom is there anything you need you know april anything i can help you with whatever it may be and reach out to them but it is important that people understand because they they may not right uh my mother to this day still thinks i'm just in there playing video games right she thinks i'm just in there playing starcraft um uh you know that's what she's so but she did respect the fact that i you know set some boundaries to a degree and and said hey you know what i'm i'm i'm just trying to learn here i'm trying to better myself and to do that i need i need to be able to focus i need the time that it is required to accomplish that and when you when you've set those those boundaries other people are on the same page and then you you also feel a sense of pride because now people know what you're trying to accomplish and now it's like oh well i don't want to let moms down i don't want to let the girlfriend down whatever maybe the husband down um so i i encourage you to explain your process and get people to be on the same page as you last but not least is a little bit more of a flexible be flexible with yourself um a lot of what was talking about scheduling having organized goals um being able to to inform people of you know how can they work within your system so that everyone's on the same page you get the time you need but being flexible with yourself is probably the number one thing that you need to understand to a degree right what do i mean by being flexible with yourself well if you're trying to learn to code or even you're a developer you're just trying to get better and you're saying look man i'm already a developer i want to go from junior to senior and i want to do it in a year i want to build i want to write a book i want to build a course whatever it is um there's going to be days where you don't want to do it there's going to be days where you're tired um you know you just got off work your boss just verbally abused you right whatever it is um you know your boyfriend dumped you your girlfriend uh is cheating on you whatever it may be right there's going to be days where you're just in a awful place could nothing could happen you're just tired you're not bored um you're stuck on something and for those days it's okay take a break no but it is okay to change your attitude and change how you're going to refocus yourself so if you've been hacking away on a project and you've just hit something and you're you're at a wall how can you continue your learning path how can you continue to be consistent within your schedule well you can um you can read some blogs for instance learn about stuff you can watch you know a twohour talk on es6 es7 whatever it is whatever you're interested in you can go to hackathons you can go to meetups have all this sort of stuff where you know go hang out with a friend who hopefully is a developer and you know do some pair programming do some just change it up is what i'm trying to say for those days that you're like god man i just i'm tired like i love this i love this but i'm so tired today and i don't want to do it well do something else that's still going to help you accomplish those milestones it's going to make you a better developer and make you stay on the path right because the thing is is every time every day even if it feels like the tiniest of steps your that consistency is moving you one step closer to your goal a one step closer to the milestone you know each one of these milestones are like a gas station we're just filling up again before you get to your final destination and that consistency through all of it is really what you're going to need to succeed in any aspect of your software career and i highly encourage you to try and keep it fun keep it fresh and keep it consistent because consistency will be what takes you to the next level of your career wherever they may be but uh anyhow guys that's my five tips on how to be consistent how to work hard essentially and stay on the path uh whatever your path may be so i hope you found it helpful thank you for watching the video and
