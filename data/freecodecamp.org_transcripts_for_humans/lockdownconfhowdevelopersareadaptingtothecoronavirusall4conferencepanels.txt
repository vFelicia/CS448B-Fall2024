00:21 - around the world today
00:23 - we
00:23 - are also going to be delving into
00:26 - four different topics that i think are
00:28 - very near and dear to all of our hearts
00:31 - these days
00:32 - continuing
00:34 - working from home effectively
00:36 - finding a job during this pandemic this
00:38 - unprecedented change in lifestyle for
00:41 - pretty much everybody around the world
00:43 - this is massive economic shock
00:47 - and
00:47 - finding
00:48 - opportunities
00:49 - and we're going to find that there are
00:52 - many many opportunities out there even
00:53 - in
00:54 - the tragedy uh the human tragedy in the
00:58 - chaos of this pandemic so
01:02 - first i would love to introduce
01:04 - fuzzil
01:05 - he is
01:07 - uh the co-founder
01:09 - of
01:10 - hashnote which is an amazing developer
01:12 - community where you can go you can
01:14 - configure your developer
01:16 - your dev blog you can have a blog
01:18 - running right on your website uh on your
01:20 - own domain you can set it up really
01:22 - quickly you can customize it it's really
01:24 - powerful tool and just so just check out
01:26 - hash note if you haven't i created the
01:28 - astronaut blog a while back

01:48 - completely candid about that uh we are
01:51 - limiting the chatting on the youtube
01:53 - video uh to people who are willing to
01:56 - become members on youtube uh i think
01:59 - it's it scales with which city you're in
02:01 - so if you're in india i think it's like
02:03 - the equivalent of two us dollars i think
02:05 - in the us it's closer to five dollars um
02:07 - i'm not sure what it is in other cities
02:09 - but those are the two prices i've heard
02:11 - um and this money goes to funding free
02:14 - code camp uh which
02:16 - is creating lots of free learning
02:18 - resources for people around the world

04:19 - thank you quincy
04:20 - it's a pleasure to co-host
04:23 - yes thank you yeah great to be
04:26 - here all right so first uh i think we
04:31 - should just open it up this is the topic
04:33 - of this first panel is
04:35 - learning the code during the pandemic uh
04:38 - during the in the age of social
04:40 - distancing
04:44 - i think the first thing that's going to
04:45 - be on pretty much everybody's mind is
04:48 - you know
04:50 - how should they best use in just general
04:52 - terms how should they best use this
04:53 - block of time that fate has handed them
04:56 - uh assuming that like activities that
04:58 - used to occupy a lot of their their free
05:00 - time are now just spent sitting at home
05:02 - uh
05:03 - how how should they best use that
05:05 - uh in your opinion and we'll go ahead
05:07 - and start with angie what are your
05:08 - thoughts on that yeah let me let me
05:11 - start off by saying that you know this
05:13 - is a trying time for everyone so
05:17 - um personally i've been you know having
05:20 - ups and downs as far as my moods and
05:24 - um the time this this time that we feel
05:28 - we have available some days it's not
05:31 - it's just a myth right um it feels like
05:33 - i have this extra time um but you know i
05:37 - have i still have my job to do
05:39 - um if you have kids at home that's
05:41 - additional work as well and if you're
05:43 - just not feeling up to it you're just
05:45 - not feeling up to it and i think that
05:47 - that's okay so i just want to preface
05:49 - anything i say with that all right
05:52 - for me
05:53 - i love learning new things i'm a teacher
05:56 - at heart as well
05:58 - so i'm trying to produce lots of content
06:01 - for people who are at home and want to
06:03 - level up during this time
06:07 - as far as my own learning my own uh
06:10 - productivity
06:11 - i
06:13 - i use my updates right so the days that
06:15 - i am feeling good and i'm feeling
06:17 - productive and i'm kind of tuning out
06:20 - the news or the days that i'm able to
06:23 - delve into
06:25 - all of the things that are out there
06:27 - there's so much content free code camp
06:30 - plenty of content there
06:32 - just all over the web there's all of
06:34 - these courses and things like that
06:37 - um that you can take a lot of them for
06:40 - free so that that's my recommendation
06:42 - like find
06:44 - what's the skill that you want to learn
06:45 - don't try to learn like all the things
06:47 - during this time but pick like one or
06:49 - two things that
06:51 - you would like to master during this
06:52 - time and find the
06:54 - resources to do so
06:58 - okay awesome thank you for that
07:00 - comprehensive insightful answer angie
07:02 - and and i just want to echo what angie
07:04 - said it's totally fine during this
07:06 - unprecedented time especially if you
07:07 - have family members who are sick or if
07:09 - you're concerned that you yourself have
07:10 - become sick uh with kavit 19 or or if
07:14 - you have other medical issues and you're
07:16 - just
07:16 - anxious about not being able to go to
07:18 - the hospital like normal
07:20 - or see a doctor like normal uh
07:22 - please don't make learning the number
07:24 - one priority like staying sane and
07:28 - just having a healthy lifestyle and
07:30 - having serenity those are the top
07:31 - priority and
07:32 - thank you very much for uh coming right
07:34 - out and saying that at the beginning
07:36 - angie because that's one thing i want to
07:38 - uh definitely emphasize everybody like
07:40 - you don't need to make personal
07:41 - sacrifices significant personal
07:43 - sacrifices
07:44 - i mean you may have to give up playing
07:45 - fortnite or watching netflix for a few
07:47 - hours but you but you shouldn't be
07:49 - giving up sleep you shouldn't be giving
07:51 - up uh
07:52 - prayer or meditation or however it is
07:55 - that you stay centered um emma uh what
07:59 - are your thoughts on
08:01 - prioritizing and figuring out what you
08:03 - want to learn during this period
08:05 - definitely i just want to reiterate what
08:07 - angie said because i believe that that
08:09 - is so
08:12 - vital right now is
08:14 - you can't learn new skills if you are
08:16 - not okay as a person so first and
08:18 - foremost take care of yourself
08:20 - um
08:22 - you know i've been struggling with
08:23 - motivation the past few weeks i was
08:25 - actually supposed to go visit my family
08:27 - for the first time in over a year and i
08:29 - had to cancel that trip so i won't see
08:30 - them for another year and so for me
08:32 - mentally that was really hard but i was
08:34 - also in the midst of preparing for
08:36 - technical interviews and so i had to
08:38 - balance studying and learning new skills
08:41 - with the emotional distress of living in
08:43 - a foreign country and being isolated
08:45 - from my family
08:47 - so it kind of all depends on your
08:50 - personal goals so if your goal is to
08:51 - look for a new job because many of us
08:53 - have been laid off
08:54 - which is very unfortunate kind of come
08:56 - up with a plan for yourself you know
08:58 - looking for a full-time job is is a
09:00 - full-time job so figure out what you
09:02 - need to learn and kind of chunk those
09:04 - into digestible pieces every single day
09:07 - don't overwork yourself
09:09 - but if your goal is to improve your
09:11 - skills and your day job or to learn
09:13 - something new find what you're
09:14 - passionate about or pick one skill to
09:16 - learn really
09:18 - really well this is the time to become
09:20 - t-shaped so having you know vertical
09:22 - knowledge in one area but also branching
09:24 - out to new areas and just picking up
09:26 - tangential skills is really important
09:28 - and uh you know not to just be
09:30 - uh totally all about free code camp even
09:33 - though i'm a fan girl um i did use free
09:35 - code camp a lot the past several weeks
09:37 - and it landed me a new job a dream job
09:40 - so i personally would recommend it to
09:42 - anyone looking to improve their skills
09:45 - and web development
09:47 - okay thank you very much uh
09:49 - for the uh we're so thrilled to hear
09:51 - about uh your new job and and we're
09:53 - excited like of course whenever you get
09:55 - a new job you want to like focus on
09:56 - getting that but at some point we would
09:58 - love to have a write-up from you about
10:00 - your your path to getting that job and
10:03 - the decisions you made and how you did
10:05 - it along the way
10:06 - um absolutely
10:08 - thank you emma uh
10:09 - that wall so
10:11 - you have
10:12 - a really deep knowledge of this but
10:14 - maybe you want to say something about uh
10:15 - balance because i know you're very
10:17 - athletic and a lot of the things you
10:19 - enjoy doing you're not able to do at the
10:20 - moment
10:23 - yeah i usually love to play badminton
10:25 - and that's
10:26 - i've been doing remote for a few years
10:28 - now and badminton was my one contact
10:31 - with society
10:32 - so
10:33 - i tried to
10:34 - you know work out at home or in uh for a
10:37 - long time
10:39 - uh while working on class central uh
10:41 - badminton was the only thing that got me
10:42 - away from it so
10:44 - i think you should there are other
10:46 - things that you can learn which are not
10:48 - stressful which are not job related
10:51 - so you can also start learning just for
10:53 - fun
10:54 - so that it does so there is no pressure
10:57 - that you need to understand the material
10:59 - i would specifically recommend a course
11:01 - called learning how to learn which also
11:03 - sets you up for like other courses that
11:05 - will do in the future and it's also very
11:07 - entertaining and a light course that i
11:10 - took a few years ago and it's
11:12 - some of the techniques that i learned in
11:14 - that course applies to uh every day
11:19 - awesome yes uh barbara oakley she's an
11:22 - amazing
11:23 - uh university professor but also just
11:25 - teacher and she's very passionate about
11:27 - learning and that really comes through
11:28 - in that course and i believe
11:30 - that's the most popular course on that's
11:33 - the most popular mooc of all uh massive
11:35 - open online courses uh is it still
11:39 - i think it's one it's it's that one or
11:41 - it's andrew ing's machine learning
11:43 - course one of those two
11:45 - yeah and by the way just to reiterate
11:49 - if you ever wondered about massive open
11:51 - online courses like these free
11:52 - university courses you keep hearing
11:53 - about uh double is
11:57 - dare i say one of the world's foremost
11:58 - experts on this having run class central
12:01 - for how many years at this point seven
12:03 - eight years eight years eight and a half
12:05 - yeah eight and a half yeah so
12:08 - any questions anybody has about
12:09 - university courses this is a perfect
12:11 - time to ask them i'm just gonna very
12:13 - quickly read a couple comments uh from
12:15 - the chat uh
12:17 - uh catalan pitt uh uh said coming from
12:20 - someone who suffered from severe anxiety
12:23 - and burnout nothing is more
12:25 - precious than your health take care of
12:26 - yourself everyone
12:28 - and beth jackson said i love how angie
12:30 - and emma uh started with uh just giving
12:33 - us all permission to check in with
12:35 - ourselves and how we're feeling
12:38 - so
12:39 - there's uh
12:40 - i i've been gathering questions uh from
12:43 - both uh the hashtag lockdown conf and
12:45 - just monitoring the chat uh
12:48 - and if anybody asks the question that
12:50 - i'm like oh this is a great question i'm
12:51 - going to feel that uh
12:53 - i will i'll do so so be sure to ask in
12:55 - chat or tweet with the hashtag
12:56 - lockdowncomp uh
12:58 - but i'd like to know a little bit about
13:00 - time management so
13:03 - high management slash procrastination
13:05 - management
13:08 - uh let's start with you angie because i
13:10 - know you're uh precocious and you learn
13:12 - a whole lot and uh
13:13 - you're constantly learning new things
13:16 - um
13:17 - how do you manage your time and how do
13:19 - you keep yourself moving forward even
13:21 - without like some structure to impose
13:24 - upon you to force you to perform and
13:26 - learn new things
13:27 - yeah um it was really difficult for me
13:29 - for a while because i i am ambitious and
13:32 - i want to learn like all the things
13:35 - and do all the things and it was really
13:37 - difficult to keep up and i'm sure we've
13:39 - all been in a place where you start some
13:41 - tutorial and you never finish it or you
13:44 - start some side project and then it
13:47 - starts collecting dust
13:49 - i'm known on twitter for spanking
13:50 - people's hands when they buy new domain
13:53 - names that they're never going to use
13:56 - what i've learned to do is uh is form
13:59 - systems for example my
14:03 - go-to is trello so i use trello
14:08 - to manage everything my work my side
14:11 - project my side projects my
14:14 - learning everything like i make cards
14:17 - for them
14:19 - and
14:20 - that was working for a little while and
14:22 - then it stopped working um and so
14:25 - i went a step further just to be a
14:27 - little bit more rigid and actually put
14:29 - like dates on all of the cards you know
14:32 - like at work
14:33 - and um you know here here's where i'm
14:36 - slotting out the dates some people also
14:38 - use their calendars in a similar way
14:40 - like okay
14:41 - let me block out this time for learning
14:45 - or whatever right um and so i'm i'm not
14:48 - that structured like i don't like
14:50 - oh at six o'clock i have to do x y and z
14:54 - um
14:55 - so i i do it in the form of days so
14:58 - today
14:59 - here are the five things i would like to
15:01 - do and i
15:03 - have that today column on my um trello
15:06 - board or whatever and so i kind of plan
15:09 - it
15:09 - i might take like
15:11 - a sunday or something and plan out my
15:13 - week um and that way i'm making sure i'm
15:15 - getting done the things that i want to
15:17 - get done including the things for my own
15:19 - professional development
15:23 - okay awesome it sounds very organized
15:25 - and a systematic approach
15:28 - procrastination
15:30 - yeah but there's one issue with that uh
15:33 - managing the trailer board is people
15:35 - often forget to revisit that board uh
15:38 - like once you move with your day-to-day
15:40 - uh
15:41 - life uh you
15:43 - get you come across something which is
15:45 - more important than what you had
15:46 - actually planned so how do you manage
15:48 - those how do you try to stay uh in the
15:51 - same schedule that you had actually
15:53 - planned what's your trick angie yeah i
15:55 - live out of this board so i don't know
15:58 - about you all but
15:59 - in the world of so many distractions
16:01 - even before
16:03 - covet um you kind of just get
16:05 - sidetracked a lot like what am i
16:07 - supposed to be doing what was i working
16:09 - on you know um so i live out of this
16:12 - board so i never forget to come back to
16:14 - it because i forget what i'm supposed to
16:15 - be doing and so it's like oh let me go
16:18 - to my board oh yeah yeah this was the
16:20 - task that i needed to do next and you're
16:22 - right things do come up my boss might
16:24 - contact me like angie i need a blog post
16:26 - asap it's like that wasn't really on my
16:29 - list of things today so you kind of you
16:32 - know re-prioritize and and although it
16:34 - sounds structured trust me i'm like very
16:37 - kind of fluid so
16:40 - um i don't mind like changing the date
16:42 - on something like okay well i guess i'm
16:43 - not gonna be able to
16:45 - um read emma's new blog post today let
16:48 - me put that for tomorrow or something
16:52 - great
16:54 - yeah and how about you emma what what
16:56 - approaches have you used
16:59 - um so i think my biggest um
17:02 - i'm taking notes because i don't want to
17:03 - forget this point i think it's really
17:05 - important so i'm going to start with the
17:07 - fact that
17:08 - i am definitely one of those people who
17:10 - like takes a ton of courses and like has
17:13 - to finish them i can't start one and not
17:15 - finish it like it's the same with
17:17 - reading books so i like waste a lot of
17:18 - time and i'll honestly taking courses
17:20 - that i don't need to be taking but in
17:22 - any case um
17:24 - i like to think about learning as
17:27 - kind of
17:28 - like from the financial world
17:29 - perspective i do a lot of learning about
17:31 - finances and how if you're going to buy
17:33 - something large think about how much
17:34 - time you have until you need to buy that
17:36 - thing and then kind of amortize that
17:38 - over every single day that you
17:40 - have until the deadline so if i have an
17:42 - interview coming up in two weeks what
17:44 - are all the things that i need to learn
17:45 - and let's amortize learning all of those
17:47 - things over every single day let's break
17:49 - it up into even pieces so you're not
17:50 - completely overwhelmed so i did that
17:53 - when i was studying for technical
17:54 - interviews
17:55 - but i never pushed myself so if i
17:57 - mentally was not in a place where i knew
18:00 - i could digest information i wouldn't i
18:02 - wouldn't learn uh it's just uh it's not
18:06 - practical to push yourself if you're not
18:08 - in a learning
18:09 - mind space um but that being said
18:12 - there's also this concept of intentional
18:14 - procrastination which is something that
18:16 - i practice so it's pushing tasks off um
18:20 - to a later time but in the in the back
18:22 - of your mind like your subconscious mind
18:24 - is putting pieces together um so if i
18:26 - have a big project like i won't start
18:28 - working on it right away because likely
18:30 - all of this that work i'm going to be
18:31 - doing is going to change over the course
18:33 - of a week so as opposed to doing all
18:36 - that work i'm actually just processing
18:38 - it in the back of my mind push off the
18:40 - tangible work until a later date and by
18:42 - that point i've kind of worked out the
18:43 - kinks in my head
18:45 - but there's a really great book called
18:47 - um
18:48 - uh
18:49 - why we sleep and it talks about how we
18:51 - form new connections when we're sleeping
18:53 - so make sure you're getting enough sleep
18:54 - it's more important than you think you
18:56 - can't actually build new
18:59 - not new memories but you can't build new
19:01 - synapses create new synapses in your
19:02 - brain to learn these new concepts if
19:04 - you're not sleeping enough so that's my
19:06 - my biggest tip
19:08 - right intentional practice
19:11 - procrastination did i get that right
19:13 - yeah
19:15 - that's definitely the term of the day
19:17 - for me because it seems like
19:19 - almost
19:20 - yeah it seems like a self-contradictory
19:22 - term but that makes so much sense
19:25 - because you're right so much of the work
19:26 - is gonna is gonna change down the road
19:29 - thanks for sharing that with us and and
19:30 - just to be 100 clear the name of that
19:32 - book again
19:34 - why we sleep um why we sleep yeah
19:36 - there's another one called make it stick
19:38 - that i haven't read yet it's next up on
19:40 - my docket but it's about how different
19:42 - learning styles uh kind of work
19:46 - the the most efficiently with you and
19:48 - your preferred learning style so if i'd
19:49 - like to watch uh video tutorials that
19:51 - might actually not be the most efficient
19:52 - way for me to learn so i'd also
19:54 - recommend that one
19:56 - awesome uh thanks for the book
19:58 - recommendations just a pop quiz
20:00 - what time did everybody go to sleep last
20:03 - night in your local time zone
20:06 - 3 am
20:08 - no that hurts me
20:10 - i did 11 11 pm okay great
20:14 - so yeah
20:15 - [Laughter]
20:20 - i usually sleep at 4am so
20:22 - my goodness well to be fair everyone's
20:25 - like uh
20:26 - what are those called your cycles i'm
20:28 - losing my english uh everyone's
20:29 - circadian rhythms are different
20:31 - especially through ages but like i'm
20:32 - usually in bed by 10 not gonna lie
20:36 - that's great no it's great to hear both
20:38 - angie and emma are uh early sleeper or
20:41 - relatively early sleepers um yeah no i
20:44 - just knew i had to be here at the crack
20:46 - of dawn but you just
20:50 - so just for some context for everybody
20:52 - tuning in
20:53 - you may be wondering like if you're in
20:54 - california why is this conference so so
20:56 - early
20:57 - well we have lots of friends in in
21:00 - asia
21:01 - and uh and uh eastern europe uh we just
21:05 - wanted to make sure
21:06 - that
21:07 - especially down in australia oceanica
21:09 - like we wanted to make sure that they
21:10 - were able to to come as well and the the
21:13 - best time to do things generally it's
21:15 - like really early u.s time it kind of
21:18 - inconveniences americans but it's it
21:20 - makes it possible for everybody else to
21:22 - attend without having to stay up super
21:23 - duper late so uh thanks if you're one of
21:26 - those people who like woke up super
21:27 - early to watch this we appreciate it uh
21:30 - you're taking one for the entire global
21:31 - team
21:34 - and uh dawal let's talk about you like
21:36 - time management
21:38 - uh and managing procrastination
21:40 - what are some uh insights you've had on
21:43 - that
21:44 - yeah i mean i'm very similar to emma and
21:47 - uh what she talked about intentional
21:48 - procrastination
21:50 - uh or
21:51 - uh barbara oakley actually calls it like
21:53 - diffused mode of thinking
21:55 - so what are like some of these uh
21:58 - concepts are
21:59 - you see them across different
22:01 - productivity books
22:03 - so like learning how to learn is what
22:05 - taught me about a
22:07 - refuse mode of thinking and it made me
22:09 - comfortable with procrastination so i
22:12 - don't really do a lot of time management
22:14 - right now
22:15 - i just have a simple sublime text list
22:17 - which keeps growing
22:19 - and if it's not important i don't come
22:21 - back to it you know so and i try like i
22:24 - think my biggest step has been for me is
22:27 - not to feel guilty about procrastination
22:31 - so especially when you're creating
22:33 - something new it's
22:34 - you know
22:36 - i think procrastination is natural and
22:39 - yeah i usually
22:41 - sit on that let it sit in my head for a
22:43 - while and it's usually when you get to
22:45 - it you do it much faster
22:48 - i think it has such a negative
22:49 - connotation
22:50 - classically and i
22:52 - i would love to change that stigma i
22:54 - think it can be used as a tool if you
22:57 - use it properly
23:00 - right
23:01 - procrastination can be kind of a compass
23:03 - needle that shows you where you actually
23:05 - need to go because the one thing that
23:06 - you are procrastinating is probably the
23:08 - most important thing that you need to do
23:10 - right
23:11 - yeah
23:12 - i also really quickly i'm going to throw
23:13 - out one more book recommendation because
23:15 - it's great in terms of achieving your
23:17 - goals especially when you're trying to
23:19 - learn and that's atomic habits by james
23:21 - clear and i promote this book every
23:23 - chance i get because it's my favorite
23:25 - but essentially it talks about instead
23:26 - of setting goals just make sure you're
23:28 - on the right trajectory to achieving
23:30 - some sort of
23:32 - mindset but also change your mindset so
23:34 - like if you are trying to quit smoking
23:36 - for example identify as a non-smoker as
23:38 - opposed to saying i don't smoke or i'm
23:40 - sorry as opposed to saying like oh i
23:41 - quit smoking so i'm not a smoker
23:44 - and changing your mindset and saying i
23:46 - am a full stack developer that will help
23:48 - you achieve these milestones and make
23:49 - sure you're on the right trajectory
23:52 - that that's great very practical advice
23:54 - uh just a very simple little mind hack
23:56 - that you can do to overcome imposter
23:58 - syndrome and
24:00 - one of our uh you know our prolific
24:02 - contributors and and community members
24:05 - over the years danny with gdg memphis
24:07 - was just asking i'm going to quote his
24:09 - question verbatim is very well phrased
24:11 - with the current times and with mental
24:14 - health being a big subject how do you
24:16 - deal with imposter syndrome and how do
24:17 - you deal with the doubts that you're
24:19 - facing especially during the lockdown
24:22 - and i'll just open that up to anybody
24:24 - who wants to jump in and has thoughts on
24:26 - that
24:29 - it's really long so i teach like an
24:31 - inspired
24:32 - workshop on like combating
24:36 - imposter syndrome i'll try to be very
24:39 - brief here um
24:41 - focus on the things that
24:44 - you know you know um imposter syndrome
24:47 - is something that
24:48 - people of all levels of success
24:52 - suffer with right um what really hit
24:54 - home for me is a quote um from maya
24:57 - angelou who is you know just profound
25:00 - and world renowned and uh she was like
25:03 - yeah i've written x number of books
25:05 - something like you know
25:07 - 19 books or something and every time i
25:10 - write the next one is when i think that
25:12 - the world is going to figure out i'm a
25:13 - fraud and it's like wow somebody who
25:17 - clearly is an expert um
25:20 - an inspiration to an entire generation
25:24 - feels that you know she's not good
25:26 - enough and she suffers with imposter
25:28 - syndrome as well so
25:31 - um it really just helped me like okay
25:32 - this is a thing it's a goofy thing and
25:35 - um
25:36 - and we gotta get over it right and so
25:38 - some i'll give you one trick that um i
25:41 - use with people who i know suffer with
25:43 - um imposter syndrome and it could be
25:46 - like um like just write down take maybe
25:50 - 30 seconds
25:52 - um give yourself 30 seconds to like two
25:55 - minutes and write down
25:58 - 10 things that you're good at
26:00 - right and that timer there is going to
26:04 - help you cheat the imposter syndrome
26:06 - because it doesn't have time to get in
26:08 - your head and talk to talk you out of it
26:11 - you're just writing it down quickly
26:13 - before you can second guess yourself and
26:15 - then at the end of that you look at that
26:17 - and reflect on it and it's like wow i
26:20 - have 10 things that i'm pretty good at
26:22 - that's that's really great you know um
26:26 - kick that imposter syndrome out
26:30 - yeah i love that i want to reiterate
26:33 - what
26:34 - you said about the fact that everyone
26:36 - regardless of where you are in your
26:38 - career how much money you make where you
26:40 - come from
26:42 - how many followers you have everyone
26:44 - experiences imposter syndrome and me
26:45 - personally i don't think i'll ever get
26:46 - over it people ask how do you get over
26:48 - it i don't think i ever will um but i
26:50 - don't know that that's a bad thing
26:51 - because it keeps me working hard um
26:55 - i will say
26:57 - try to recognize your small wins if you
26:58 - can recognize all these small things
27:00 - that you do that will compound over time
27:02 - you'll recognize how far you've come
27:04 - but i also kind of just want to
27:06 - challenge the question of like what is
27:08 - an expert like there's no definition of
27:09 - what exactly you have to have skill set
27:12 - wise to be considered an expert um and
27:14 - you don't need to be an expert to have
27:15 - valuable information so you know your
27:18 - your journey is unique and no one will
27:21 - ever walk that same journey as you which
27:23 - means you are viewing the world and your
27:26 - experiences through a different lens of
27:27 - someone else so your information and
27:29 - what you're teaching even if it's been
27:31 - done a thousand times if you want to
27:33 - teach react hooks um do it like
27:36 - absolutely because the way that you've
27:38 - learned it might resonate with someone
27:40 - else who was struggling with the concept
27:42 - so i would say you know recognize your
27:44 - small wins and just
27:46 - try to
27:49 - realize that everyone feels this way
27:50 - it's not just you
27:52 - can i piggyback on what emma said real
27:54 - quickly
27:56 - on um owning like your expertise and
27:59 - your your voice is so important
28:02 - um like emma said there's going to be
28:05 - dozens of
28:07 - blog posts tutorials or whatever on a
28:10 - certain topic and maybe you want to
28:13 - speak on that topic because you just
28:14 - learned about it and you want to write
28:17 - on like you know a hash note or
28:19 - something like that um and you're like
28:21 - oh well you know the the great expert
28:24 - has already written about it who am i to
28:26 - write about it let me tell you um when
28:29 - i'm learning trying to learn something
28:31 - and think about it from your own point
28:33 - of view you google whatever the topic is
28:35 - and you find like a bunch of results and
28:38 - you go to like one of them right
28:41 - and that one's not clicking for you so
28:43 - you go to the second one and then maybe
28:45 - you go to the third one um there's
28:47 - sometimes it's not until like the fifth
28:49 - or sixth one that i go to that is like
28:52 - okay this is speaking to me and how i
28:55 - learned this is great the other ones are
28:58 - in a different learning style
29:01 - are taught in a different style that
29:03 - doesn't resonate with me as well right
29:05 - so don't be afraid to put out content um
29:09 - that is already out there your voice and
29:11 - your approach
29:13 - is the differentiator
29:16 - [Music]
29:19 - so
29:20 - what other thoughts you all have as far
29:22 - as uh
29:24 - just
29:26 - using that confidence that you're
29:27 - getting uh these these same techniques
29:30 - that you're using to overcome imposter
29:32 - syndrome in terms of
29:33 - uh
29:34 - approaching
29:36 - the
29:37 - you know the meta of
29:39 - learning the code and going out and
29:40 - getting new developer jobs and working
29:42 - as a developer
29:44 - how would you use those same or similar
29:47 - techniques
29:48 - to
29:49 - learning a new topic for example it is
29:51 - very common for people to get stressed
29:53 - out about
29:55 - learning new mathematical concepts like
29:57 - if you wanted to learn linear algebra
29:59 - for example and you wanted to get uh
30:01 - it's a very commonly used uh
30:03 - form of mathematics and software
30:05 - development especially these days with
30:06 - like all the machine learning
30:08 - uh tools out there and and
30:09 - [Music]
30:11 - how would you yourself pump yourself up
30:13 - if you wanted to sit down and like i'm
30:15 - gonna learn some linear algebra this
30:17 - weekend
30:18 - what would your process be
30:21 - i think you need to find your why this
30:23 - is another book i could just open up you
30:25 - know a conference to talk about books
30:27 - find your why is
30:29 - start with why i'm sorry by simon sinek
30:31 - um he talks a lot about the reasoning
30:34 - behind why we do things if you can sit
30:36 - there and tell yourself
30:38 - i want to learn linear algebra because
30:40 - it will help me get a job at nasa i
30:42 - don't know maybe that's one of the
30:43 - requirements um as opposed to i need to
30:46 - learn this
30:47 - it's going to change your mindset um and
30:50 - it's i get to learn this right like i
30:52 - have the ability to learn this that's
30:54 - not something everyone get you know has
30:55 - the the privilege or the ability to do
30:58 - so for me it wasn't
30:59 - uh i have to study for technical
31:01 - interviews it was i get the opportunity
31:03 - to interview for an incredible job and
31:06 - that is my driving force
31:10 - great
31:13 - so um i would like to bring uh focus on
31:17 - like how do you measure success like you
31:19 - have talk uh you have spoken about how
31:21 - do you manage your tasks uh how do you
31:24 - pick books how do you pick resources how
31:26 - do you stay motivated but during this
31:28 - pandemic since a lot of things are
31:30 - happening at the same time you're
31:31 - hearing news from presidents you are
31:33 - hearing news uh breaking news from so
31:36 - many different areas how do you measure
31:38 - your success like how do you measure
31:40 - what you have learned and what you have
31:42 - not learned and because
31:44 - right now nobody is validating those
31:46 - things you are not attending interviews
31:49 - so how do you measure your success
31:51 - during this pandemic time
31:54 - i take small wins i'm going to focus on
31:57 - the learning piece of it um so starting
32:00 - a course yay me like i i am my biggest
32:04 - cheerleader right um and that helps
32:07 - fight imposter syndrome as well so yay
32:09 - me i started a course yay me i finished
32:12 - a chapter and you know i got a pretty
32:15 - good result on the quiz there
32:18 - um gay me i've actually finished this
32:21 - course you're going to hear about it on
32:22 - twitter yay i did it and then i take it
32:26 - a step further as well right because we
32:28 - all know that you can watch a tutorial
32:31 - but it's especially on coding but until
32:34 - you actually code yourself it's really
32:36 - hard to
32:38 - retain that information and so um then i
32:41 - want to go build something you know i'm
32:43 - going to take it a step further and it
32:44 - doesn't have to be a big huge app just
32:47 - something that's exercising what it is
32:49 - that i learned and yep i'm going to have
32:51 - to
32:52 - go back to that tutorial because some of
32:54 - the things i forgot i don't quite
32:56 - remember the syntax i don't beat myself
32:58 - up about that that's normal right we're
33:01 - i'm new to this
33:03 - um and that's okay forgive yourself yup
33:06 - that's why the resources are there keep
33:08 - consulting it right and it's not just
33:10 - one problem i might say okay now let me
33:12 - do another problem and after maybe two
33:14 - or three of those i'm not checking those
33:17 - resources as much anymore that's a win i
33:20 - count those small wins all day long
33:24 - absolutely yeah
33:28 - go ahead
33:29 - oh
33:30 - class central was a side project for me
33:32 - so it was the same thing i was trying to
33:35 - get better at php and i started it as a
33:37 - side project a one-page site to list all
33:40 - the courses from stanford and i just
33:43 - happened to be at the right place right
33:44 - time and for the first two years it was
33:47 - a side project
33:48 - and i kept adding new things just for
33:51 - the fun of it and
33:53 - i'm lucky now it's my job but
33:56 - i think finding a project finding some
33:58 - sort of
33:59 - thing that you're passionate about and
34:01 - then building something around it is is
34:03 - a good way to sort of
34:06 - implement what you're learning courses
34:08 - sometimes can give you a false sense of
34:11 - learning
34:12 - so trying to do something that's not
34:14 - following a script of a
34:16 - project or that somebody else gave it to
34:19 - you can be a good way to actually test
34:22 - yourself
34:23 - and figure out what you have not learned
34:26 - right right
34:28 - i um
34:29 - i just quickly wanted to mention a
34:31 - couple of things so for me success is
34:34 - success is subjective um but for me
34:36 - success is not a salary or a job title
34:39 - it's a mindset and
34:41 - i
34:42 - for me
34:43 - i realize i'm successful if i post a
34:46 - piece of content and it helps one person
34:49 - that makes me feel successful um but
34:51 - just to kind of visualize these things
34:53 - print out uh
34:55 - like a chart or whatever and you've got
34:58 - like different values on there and you
35:00 - every time you complete a course for
35:01 - example you color in a square or
35:03 - something so i do this when i'm paying
35:04 - off all my medical debt but i still have
35:06 - in the us like fill in hundred or
35:08 - thousand dollar increments right and
35:10 - every time you pay off a thousand
35:11 - dollars color it in you can apply that
35:12 - same thing to taking courses or um you
35:15 - know having successful github repos that
35:18 - aren't half alive like all of mine are i
35:20 - mean every time you take a course or you
35:22 - uh close a pull request like color it in
35:24 - and those visual reinforcements will
35:26 - help you stay motivated
35:29 - right
35:31 - awesome so visualizing your learning it
35:33 - like mapping it out uh do you all use
35:35 - any sort of tools to build like road
35:38 - maps of what you're going to learn or to
35:41 - how would you organize okay let me just
35:43 - ask a very open-ended high-level
35:45 - question okay
35:46 - you decide that you need to that you've
35:48 - always been relatively weak in
35:50 - mathematics uh maybe you got through
35:52 - like the high school stuff and you kind
35:54 - of dodged or took the easier math
35:56 - courses in university the the easiest
35:58 - required ones uh you know or you didn't
36:00 - even go to university and like basically
36:02 - your math stopped it like high school
36:04 - geometry or trigonometry or something i
36:06 - mean if you're in the us i know in like
36:07 - china you would learn way more than that
36:09 - by the time you finished high school but
36:11 - um
36:12 - let's say
36:13 - that you want to go back and fill in the
36:16 - gaps how would you just using what you
36:18 - already know about learning lots of
36:20 - about qa
36:21 - or learning a whole lot about uh you
36:23 - know software engineering concepts uh
36:25 - learning new programming languages using
36:28 - what you know from your years and years
36:30 - of actually learning things new on your
36:32 - own and on the job
36:34 - how would you go about tackling that
36:36 - task
36:37 - how would you decide what to do let's
36:39 - just start from from
36:40 - day one you sit down you decide that you
36:43 - need to learn this new thing and we'll
36:44 - just say like you need to learn linear
36:46 - algebra since that's what i mentioned if
36:48 - you already know linear algebra don't
36:49 - worry about this maybe you can choose a
36:50 - different math this one
36:52 - and we'll go ahead and just start with
36:54 - uh we'll start with emma
36:56 - yeah so first of all i did terribly in
36:58 - math like i basically failed calculus if
37:00 - you're also bad at math it's fine i just
37:03 - want to throw that out there but um what
37:05 - i like to do is on one piece of printer
37:08 - paper i write down everything that's
37:11 - related i create almost like a graph
37:12 - structure where i'll start with the main
37:14 - topic i'm going to use data structures
37:16 - and algorithms because for me i can talk
37:17 - about that more freely so if i need to
37:19 - learn data structures and algorithms all
37:21 - right what data structures do i need
37:22 - break that down okay i need to learn
37:24 - things that are already built into
37:26 - javascript arrays objects sets things
37:28 - like that well what other things do i
37:30 - need to learn that aren't built into
37:31 - javascript linked lists uh you know hash
37:35 - tables i don't know whatever other ones
37:37 - stacks cues
37:38 - and kind of just create a little map of
37:40 - my for myself on one piece of paper and
37:43 - then based on those things what are the
37:44 - things i already am confident in
37:46 - color those in um and for the things
37:49 - that i need to work on what resources
37:50 - can i use to learn those and i create
37:52 - like a playlist i saw someone in the
37:54 - chat mention notion i use notion all day
37:56 - every day i also use the things app to
37:59 - create different lists like a to do
38:00 - application
38:02 - um
38:03 - and between those two i just kind of
38:05 - keep tabs on the on the different
38:06 - resources that i would like to
38:09 - watch to fill in those knowledge gaps
38:13 - okay awesome and how would you tackle
38:15 - that angie
38:17 - yeah i'll be honest like sometimes when
38:18 - i'm about to learn something new i'm not
38:21 - quite sure of
38:23 - um
38:25 - what's what am i supposed to be learning
38:27 - exactly right it's a new concept i just
38:29 - know let's say i'm going for a job or
38:30 - something and i need to know
38:34 - react right
38:36 - given that all i know is the word react
38:38 - i don't know anything about it i don't
38:40 - know i don't even know how to examine
38:41 - the courses that i could look at to see
38:44 - okay what does this course cover versus
38:46 - this course i don't know what i'm
38:48 - supposed to be looking for so in um
38:50 - situations like that i need to figure
38:53 - out like okay what's the best course for
38:55 - me what is it that i need to learn here
38:57 - and with that i seek out other people
39:00 - right um you don't have to do this all
39:02 - and figure it out on your own i'll give
39:04 - you a little tip though don't send
39:05 - people like generic questions of
39:08 - um hey i want to learn react where
39:11 - should i start right because that could
39:13 - be a really big answer and
39:15 - people if they don't know you might not
39:17 - take the time out to answer those types
39:19 - of things so try to be like very
39:21 - specific i need to learn react because i
39:24 - want to do x y and z
39:27 - maybe here are two or three courses that
39:30 - i'm considering do you have any opinions
39:34 - on you know which one of these would
39:35 - best get me to
39:37 - point b where i'm trying to get to right
39:40 - so that's a more specific question
39:42 - so figuring out like okay what is it
39:44 - that i even need to learn i'm finding
39:47 - that course again i have to block out
39:49 - the time otherwise the day gets away
39:51 - from me so
39:53 - i'll say okay i'm gonna take this course
39:55 - it says that this course is six hours
39:58 - long
39:59 - um okay where can i squeeze six hours in
40:01 - and i'm scheduling it out like maybe i
40:04 - only have 30 minutes or an hour that i
40:07 - can devote to something a day so okay
40:10 - let me make my little trello cards with
40:12 - 30 minute slots
40:14 - i can probably squeeze it in on monday
40:16 - and then again on thursday and then
40:18 - maybe you know tuesday or whatever so
40:20 - figure out and be realistic with
40:22 - yourself don't try to squeeze in more
40:25 - than you know you have time for um space
40:28 - it out if it takes you
40:30 - three weeks to get through six hour
40:32 - course that is okay you know
40:34 - you've done it you've gotten through it
40:36 - versus trying to do six hours and one
40:38 - day which is not that realistic for a
40:40 - lot of people
40:42 - yeah i just i wanna i wanna say plus one
40:45 - to everything angie just said 100
40:47 - because like half the time i have no
40:48 - idea where to start and it's just a
40:50 - dumpster fire but secondly um
40:53 - don't memorize solutions understand the
40:55 - concepts and it's gonna take longer to
40:57 - do that but if you're interviewing for
41:00 - example um if you just memorize
41:02 - solutions but can't under don't
41:03 - understand that underlying foundations
41:05 - it's gonna be nearly impossible for you
41:07 - to explain this to an interviewer so
41:10 - be patient with yourself because
41:11 - understanding concepts takes a lot
41:13 - longer than memorizing but it will go a
41:16 - lot a long way
41:18 - awesome and i just want to highlight
41:19 - what jillian keenan said in chat uh she
41:22 - said
41:23 - i think a really good way to determine
41:24 - knowledge gaps is to ask yourself
41:26 - can you teach this to someone else maybe
41:29 - if you i mean there's always the rubber
41:31 - duck method if you're if you're social
41:33 - distancing completely by yourself but if
41:35 - you're with your partner or if you've
41:37 - got kids around you could try to teach
41:39 - them a little bit and and uh you know
41:42 - there's the saying i can't remember who
41:44 - said it but it was in my email blast
41:46 - that i sent last week it says teaching
41:47 - is learning twice
41:49 - um and
41:51 - you know
41:52 - you figure out the gaps in your own
41:53 - knowledge when you try to teach someone
41:55 - else
41:56 - i want to make sure we get an answer
41:57 - from daw although because i know he's
41:59 - just this is what he does he eats sleeps
42:01 - and breathes uh continuing education uh
42:05 - dal wall how many moocs have you
42:07 - completed by the way at this point you
42:08 - think
42:09 - probably a dozen not too many
42:11 - okay yeah but still i mean that's like
42:13 - the equivalent of like doing a graduate
42:15 - degree it's like 12 12 courses right uh
42:18 - but yeah how would you how would you
42:20 - tackle learning a big ambiguous new
42:23 - field of study
42:25 - i think i would try to find a starter
42:27 - course
42:28 - that allows me to put like five to ten
42:30 - hours
42:31 - and just making sure it's good enough
42:33 - and try to do a speed run through it
42:36 - basically understand like you don't have
42:38 - to understand everything but just to
42:40 - know what you don't know and i think
42:42 - that will help you understand
42:44 - then from there on it would help you
42:46 - plan out better
42:48 - i think we sometimes try to optimize
42:51 - things that we don't even know so i
42:52 - think just getting started as quickly as
42:54 - possible
42:55 - is something i would uh try to do
42:58 - instead of
43:00 - because you can go down the internet
43:02 - rabbit hole for of the best courses
43:05 - uh reddit comments you know like
43:07 - everywhere and then
43:08 - you might actually spend up more time
43:10 - finding a course then
43:12 - doing some sort of a short course that
43:14 - uh could take a few hours
43:17 - right right and uh i would like to bring
43:19 - focus on uh something that's uh
43:22 - happening in the
43:23 - internet right now that most of the
43:25 - companies like coursera and egghead they
43:27 - are opening up their courses they are
43:30 - giving the courses for free so what are
43:31 - your thoughts on that like do you think
43:33 - this is the right time for developers to
43:35 - grab this opportunity and learn as much
43:38 - as possible or should they focus on
43:40 - picking the right topic on these
43:42 - platforms and just completing few
43:46 - i think definitely picking the right
43:48 - topics um
43:50 - like places like free code camp always
43:53 - have free content i run test automation
43:56 - university we have free courses on
43:59 - programming and testing and all the
44:01 - things uh development
44:03 - um
44:04 - and yeah i think it's great that other
44:06 - platforms like pluralsight and things
44:09 - are opening up their content right now
44:11 - for free but i wouldn't recommend like
44:14 - oh let me start all the things right if
44:16 - you have 10 tutorials going
44:19 - the likelihood of you finishing them all
44:21 - is very small
44:23 - even the likelihood of finishing one
44:25 - probably goes down when you've started
44:28 - so many
44:29 - figure out what it is that you want to
44:30 - learn and i'm sure a lot of us have like
44:32 - backlists
44:34 - of things that we've always wanted to do
44:36 - and now maybe we have a little bit extra
44:38 - time
44:39 - and so it feels like we should probably
44:41 - tackle that entire list no
44:44 - think about like i don't know what are
44:46 - you most passionate about or what do you
44:48 - need right away for your current job or
44:50 - your next job or you know
44:53 - what's just something interesting that
44:54 - you would want to learn and maybe pick
44:56 - one
44:58 - and start that i don't know do any of
45:00 - you do like multiple tutorials in
45:02 - parallel i i personally have to do like
45:04 - one at a time
45:06 - yeah don't do it um
45:08 - i learned this the hard way um
45:10 - i
45:11 - your time and your willpower are
45:13 - depletable resources so you need to use
45:16 - them efficiently and effectively and i'm
45:18 - the kind of person that has shiny object
45:20 - syndrome like i see a tutorial i want to
45:22 - take it and i start it but what that
45:23 - means is i'm actually learning the
45:25 - skills that are relevant to me right now
45:27 - so um i would definitely recommend
45:29 - sticking with one because human beings
45:32 - like to think we can multitask but we
45:34 - can't
45:37 - great yeah i mean i would agree to
45:40 - trying to i that's why i usually prefer
45:42 - like full courses which are like almost
45:44 - a month long or something so once you
45:46 - start something you don't have to think
45:48 - too much
45:49 - in terms of finding resources
45:51 - you just do one single curriculum it's
45:54 - like what it's one storyline
45:57 - so
45:58 - hopefully it's coherent so you're
45:59 - building on top of the knowledge week
46:01 - after week and that's why you generally
46:04 - have a preference for university courses
46:07 - uh if i can jump in and just say like
46:11 - the reason free co-camp is a single
46:12 - linear curriculum is precisely to avoid
46:15 - what angie and emma are talking about
46:17 - shiny object syndrome
46:21 - historically
46:23 - universities just had a single major
46:25 - everybody just studied liberal arts and
46:26 - that was like you learn greek and you
46:28 - learn latin you learn math and you learn
46:30 - all these different topics but everybody
46:32 - learned the exact same thing
46:34 - and everybody in the world who went to
46:36 - college essentially learned the same
46:37 - general body of knowledge and we've
46:40 - gotten away from that with like all
46:41 - these different electives and it makes
46:42 - sense if you're like learning nursing
46:44 - that you shouldn't have to necessarily
46:45 - learn um
46:46 - you know
46:49 - i'm i'm trying to think of a good
46:51 - a good analogy here but but you wouldn't
46:53 - necessarily need to learn uh
46:57 - a lot of different skills if you were
46:58 - going to become a super specialist but i
47:00 - would argue that we should have a more
47:04 - generalistic uh you know university
47:06 - experience and then people can
47:07 - specialize on the job
47:09 - but anyway to to try to
47:12 - blunt the uh
47:14 - the power of shiny into object syndrome
47:16 - of grabbing your attention pulling you
47:18 - away from what you need to do and
47:19 - ultimately serving as a tool for
47:21 - procrastination we decided very early
47:23 - that free cooking would have a single
47:25 - linear curriculum and people would work
47:27 - from the top to the bottom and there
47:29 - wouldn't be a bunch of forks in the road
47:30 - uh because generally when your
47:32 - university is asking you to choose
47:33 - electives they're they're basically
47:36 - asking you to make a decision in a
47:38 - relatively uninformed way
47:40 - um
47:41 - yeah i like that free code camp is
47:43 - linear but it's kind of like a la carte
47:44 - in a sense because you can start
47:45 - anywhere you don't have to start at the
47:47 - beginning um
47:49 - which is really invaluable like you have
47:51 - a clear path but you don't have to
47:52 - follow that path if you don't fit into
47:55 - it
47:57 - yeah and i
47:59 - i don't want to talk too much about free
48:00 - code camp on this because there's no way
48:01 - you're here
48:03 - like everybody watching wants to hear
48:04 - from you all but i will say like
48:06 - it's highly informed from like video
48:08 - game design and i think the future
48:11 - of education you can see it in video
48:13 - games uh that that it's not only fun but
48:16 - it's almost addictive
48:18 - if we can make learning addictive
48:20 - then we've truly won
48:22 - and uh we're truly gonna have like a
48:24 - really uh
48:25 - enlightened
48:26 - uh
48:28 - populist
48:34 - so we still have about six minutes five
48:36 - and a half minutes left
48:38 - uh
48:39 - fuzzil do you did you have any closing
48:41 - questions that you wanted to ask to the
48:43 - panel
48:43 - yeah i'm just going through the twitter
48:45 - feed and uh someone uh
48:48 - recently asked one question uh which is
48:50 - like really interesting and something we
48:52 - keep on seeing on astronaut every time
48:55 - which is like uh
48:58 - oh my god
48:59 - uh
49:00 - like how do you uh
49:03 - overcome uh the um that someone else is
49:06 - doing better than you uh has learned
49:08 - something really good and has created a
49:10 - really popular open source project and i
49:13 - am some and i am somebody who is lagging
49:15 - behind so again like as emma has spoken
49:18 - about the self-motivation so what tips
49:21 - do you have for beginners who are
49:22 - feeling this way
49:24 - i always tell people beginners
49:27 - experts anybody
49:29 - there's a philosophy i follow where
49:34 - i think about it as running a race right
49:39 - and when i'm running my race
49:41 - i'm looking ahead
49:43 - and focusing on my own path
49:46 - and yeah i might glance over to other
49:48 - people who are running but my focus is
49:51 - on my race right and if you
49:54 - stare too hard at other people think
49:57 - about the momentum that you're losing
49:59 - because you're not focused ahead
50:02 - and that's true in life if you're so
50:04 - focused on everyone else's journey
50:06 - that's time and energy and momentum and
50:10 - self-confidence that you're losing
50:13 - focus on your own race everyone has
50:15 - different circumstances right i'm at
50:18 - home i don't have kids
50:20 - my job is very flexible so i probably
50:23 - can do more than someone else who has
50:26 - five children at home and a partner who
50:29 - is sick
50:30 - and you know their fever is running high
50:33 - and you know it's just a lot of
50:35 - different circumstances don't focus on
50:38 - other people's journey you don't really
50:39 - know their story you don't know how many
50:41 - times that they've fallen down this
50:44 - might be their third attempt at the
50:45 - thing that this is your first attempt at
50:48 - right and maybe that's why they're
50:49 - moving a little faster
50:51 - it could be a million different reasons
50:53 - don't focus on it because you're losing
50:55 - momentum in your own race focus on your
50:58 - race
50:59 - i also think too this is an important
51:02 - message which is computers are binary
51:04 - but humans aren't and so you're and you
51:07 - mentioned your journey is not going to
51:09 - have feature parody
51:12 - with another person so
51:14 - focus on who you were are today and
51:16 - compare that to who you were yesterday
51:19 - right
51:20 - right so here's a tip for all the big
51:22 - nerd developers don't get intimidated by
51:24 - someone else's success focus on your own
51:27 - journey
51:31 - yeah yeah i know i know i don't want to
51:33 - monopolize this but
51:36 - someone else's success does not take
51:37 - away from your success
51:39 - so
51:40 - you know unless you're applying for the
51:41 - same job but don't compare yourself to
51:43 - anyone else um focus on yourself and be
51:45 - genuinely happy for others who are doing
51:47 - well because again it doesn't impact
51:48 - your success
51:50 - right
51:51 - yeah i think so many people get in this
51:53 - kind of scarcity mindset where they're
51:54 - like feeling like they're competing with
51:56 - other people that are their peers but
51:59 - the reality is you know the world is a
52:01 - big place i mean we can't even fathom
52:04 - seven billion people like our brains
52:07 - can't capacitate those like that scale
52:09 - of numbers and uh you know nobody
52:12 - understands how everything works nobody
52:14 - understands how the market works how
52:16 - different companies are able to bring in
52:18 - revenue and survive it's a complex
52:20 - ecosystem
52:21 - and uh within all that ambiguity you can
52:24 - be assured that there is a tremendous
52:25 - amount of
52:27 - opportunity
52:28 - uh i mean we've somehow managed for most
52:31 - of modern human history to keep a bulk
52:33 - of people employed after this pandemic
52:35 - passes
52:37 - there are going to be new opportunities
52:38 - out there
52:39 - and you're not going to be competing
52:41 - head-to-head with people around you in
52:43 - some abstract way you'll be competing in
52:45 - the sense that the more entrants into a
52:46 - field potentially you know the the more
52:49 - uh supply and demand uh demand uh is met
52:52 - and price goes down as a result but
52:55 - that's only going to have a very small
52:57 - marginal impact on you
52:59 - in practice all these people
53:01 - that are here in this chat room with you
53:03 - that are watching this video with you
53:05 - they're your allies and you have so much
53:07 - more to gain
53:08 - from collaborating with them than you
53:09 - have to lose from them also succeeding i
53:12 - mean
53:12 - it it really is true like other people's
53:15 - success is your success
53:17 - and celebrating other people's success
53:19 - is a great way to build rapport with
53:21 - them because that's the moment that they
53:23 - really are proud of and that they want
53:25 - other people to jump in uh any closing
53:28 - thoughts before we end this panel just
53:31 - there have been so many great things
53:32 - that you all have said focus on your own
53:34 - race your own journey
53:35 - is something angie said and just a
53:37 - minute ago
53:40 - emma said your journey is not going to
53:41 - have feature parity with another person
53:44 - great great use of uh software uh
53:46 - analogy there
53:50 - all right well we are going to
53:53 - uh i just want to thank
53:55 - everyone for joining we're going to take
53:58 - a
53:59 - five to ten minute break there are going
54:00 - to be slides playing there's going to be
54:02 - music from bass rebels which is this
54:04 - great youtube channel with with
54:06 - copyright free music
54:08 - that we can listen to uh while and jam
54:10 - out and just chat uh tweet questions for
54:13 - the next panel the next panel is going
54:15 - to be
54:16 - um
54:18 - how to work successfully from home
54:19 - without going crazy
54:21 - and i just want to thank our phenomenal
54:24 - guests for everything that they brought
54:26 - to the table here and that they've
54:27 - shared with us angie uh jones up in san
54:30 - francisco uh be sure to scroll down in

56:01 - uh of course joined by my uh co-mc
56:05 - puzzle with uh hashnow.com and hey guys
56:11 - hey
56:12 - um and we this panel is about how to
56:15 - work productively from home

56:19 - and we're going to be talking with three
56:21 - people who probably have a combined
56:23 - total of at least a decade or two of
56:25 - working from home
56:27 - uh
56:28 - tons of wisdom here if you're just
56:31 - starting working from home this is the
56:33 - panel for you you're gonna learn all the
56:35 - little tricks and hacks that these
56:36 - people have picked up over the years uh
56:38 - so i'm gonna go ahead and i'm thrilled
56:41 - to introduce you to our guests
56:44 - these are prominent developers from the
56:46 - community uh many of whom uh i've
56:49 - interviewed
56:50 - on the free cocaine podcast where we
56:52 - publish like videos of their workflows
56:54 - and things like that so i'll start with
56:56 - uh
56:57 - colleen schneidel schnetler
57:00 - and and she is a
57:03 - freelance developer in the arlington
57:05 - virginia area she has three kids and she
57:08 - manages to work from home
57:10 - while her three kids are
57:12 - not like barging in and completely
57:14 - disrupting her all day which is quite an
57:15 - accomplishment uh we also have
57:18 - jessica chan from the austin area in
57:21 - texas um
57:23 - and jessica is the coder coder you may
57:26 - have heard of her or
57:28 - checked out her in incredible instagram
57:30 - which is just
57:31 - filled with programming tips and it's
57:34 - just
57:35 - it's one of my favorite instagrams i
57:37 - strongly recommend you all check it out
57:39 - and uh and then of course we have sid
57:41 - who's in uh
57:44 - he's in amsterdam and he works for code
57:46 - sandbox which you may have heard of it's
57:48 - a new
57:49 - relatively new coding playground where
57:51 - you can go and build projects right in
57:52 - the browser
57:54 - he was previously at off zero
57:56 - again both jessica and sid have
57:59 - extensive experience working remotely as
58:01 - well
58:03 - so uh welcome
58:08 - thank you
58:10 - yeah
58:11 - so uh just just to start off like
58:16 - what has changed over the past month and
58:19 - a half
58:20 - for each of you maybe you could describe
58:22 - how
58:23 - the pandemic is affecting your your
58:26 - day-to-day life and and we can we can
58:28 - start with uh jessica
58:31 - sure well i have been working remotely
58:34 - for maybe the past four years or so so
58:36 - it's kind of weird because
58:38 - on a day-to-day basis even before this
58:40 - all happened i wasn't really
58:42 - i didn't have like a huge active you
58:44 - know life outside the house i would you
58:46 - know stay indoors do my work
58:48 - and so day to day a lot of things have
58:51 - stayed really the same
58:53 - but obviously i think just knowing
58:55 - what's going on in the world right now
58:56 - and you know not being able to say visit
58:59 - family and friends in person that's
59:01 - definitely been a huge change
59:05 - and just kind of moving from in-person
59:07 - meetups with friends to you know house
59:09 - party or you know
59:11 - different hangouts with friends instead
59:13 - so it's just kind of moving into the
59:15 - online virtual space like we're doing
59:17 - now
59:19 - awesome uh and how about you colleen
59:22 - so our lives have been completely
59:25 - upended because of the the children are
59:27 - no longer going to school and in the
59:29 - state of virginia they have cancelled
59:31 - school for the rest of the school year
59:33 - so
59:33 - it's been a month now my kids are three
59:36 - six and eight and none of them are um in
59:40 - school we don't have any child care
59:41 - options
59:42 - so
59:43 - it's i mean it's been really hard i've
59:45 - got to be honest like it has been okay i
59:47 - have a second grader so he should
59:49 - probably learn something the
59:50 - kindergartner and the three-year-old
59:52 - like they'll be okay
59:54 - um so trying to balance like this
59:57 - homeschooling which i am not a teacher
60:00 - um i've challenged i've been very it's
60:02 - been very challenging bad and like still
60:03 - finding the time for work
60:07 - yeah
60:08 - i can only imagine i i have two kids and
60:10 - it's it's crazy enough but yeah again
60:12 - they're they're not school-aged so we
60:14 - don't have to really worry about
60:15 - teaching them
60:18 - um and sid how about you how how's uh
60:20 - calvin 19 impacted your day-to-day life
60:23 - out there in amsterdam
60:24 - so i'm closer to jessica on this one
60:26 - that on the surface it's kind of the
60:29 - same like i was working remotely the
60:31 - whole team works remotely
60:33 - but i want to say that
60:35 - it doesn't feel like the usual at all
60:38 - like it feels very very weird
60:40 - um at home there's been like some tiny
60:43 - changes we have to make because my wife
60:45 - also works at home now so with like this
60:47 - this is the meeting room and the dining
60:49 - table is the co-working space so it's
60:52 - like we can't have like we can't sit at
60:54 - the same place and have meetings at the
60:55 - same time so we're like constantly
60:58 - booking the conference room
61:00 - uh but other than that it just it feels
61:03 - weird but like it's
61:06 - my life overall probably hasn't been
61:08 - impacted as much
61:10 - right i don't know about you guys but do
61:11 - you feel like like i feel like just the
61:14 - stress of the whole situation has really
61:16 - impacted my ability to focus too so
61:19 - there's been kind of third order effects
61:21 - like checking the news and seeing what's
61:23 - going on and then trying to work
61:25 - definitely right
61:27 - right yeah i've had to push myself back
61:29 - from keeping up to date on the news
61:31 - because it was kind of getting a little
61:33 - too much and just affecting your mental
61:35 - state
61:37 - right right so as you know like there
61:39 - are a lot of companies who had never
61:41 - heard about work from home concept so
61:43 - this is like the first time they are
61:45 - introduced to and i keep getting
61:47 - complaints from
61:49 - my colleagues my friends and they are
61:50 - saying like none of the work is
61:52 - happening is actually happening so
61:54 - things that were supposed to take one
61:56 - day of time it's like they're taking
61:58 - seven days of time to finish so what
62:00 - advice do you have for developers who
62:02 - are introduced to work from home
62:04 - environment for the first time
62:09 - so yeah i said you can go ahead first
62:13 - i can start
62:14 - i kind of feel bad for them because
62:16 - this isn't remote this is like this is
62:19 - not how
62:20 - remote jobs usually are so they've kind
62:22 - of been thrown into this without
62:24 - preparation without being set up for
62:27 - this so i'm feeling like
62:29 - and to be honest it's not just them even
62:31 - remote teams like mine are probably
62:33 - working at like 50 percent productivity
62:36 - right right now so i'd say that's just
62:38 - kind of the way it is right now because
62:40 - of like the stress and like it's just
62:42 - hard to focus and get things done
62:44 - right um
62:45 - we can talk about tips soon but i just
62:48 - want to like start by saying like it it
62:51 - would be harsh to like force
62:53 - productivity on anyone at this time and
62:55 - what's been really useful in our team is
62:57 - just kind of having that conversation
63:00 - where like i have a lot of guilt about
63:02 - not being productive because that's
63:04 - something i struggled with anyways so
63:06 - just having that conversation in the
63:08 - team has been has been kind of like
63:10 - comforting because i realize nobody is
63:12 - at their best right now so people are
63:14 - more forgiving than you would imagine
63:17 - right right
63:20 - yeah i do think it comes
63:22 - down a lot to just your company culture
63:25 - and how
63:26 - maybe empathetic or sympathetic your
63:28 - manager as well as the higher ups your
63:30 - company can be so i think you know this
63:32 - unfortunately might be one of your these
63:34 - your miles your mileage may vary
63:36 - situations um you know if your company
63:38 - is really understanding and they they
63:39 - know that you know there's parents
63:41 - having to homeschool their kids and
63:42 - there's more understanding in terms of
63:44 - having expectations but
63:46 - it can be difficult if you're working
63:48 - for
63:49 - a company or a manager who's expecting
63:52 - you know the same or maybe even a higher
63:53 - amount of productivity out of you at
63:56 - this current time which is just not
63:57 - really possible
63:58 - [Music]
64:00 - i just wanted to um just kind of like
64:02 - this is a great panel but i just want to
64:04 - come out and acknowledge the fact that
64:05 - we're all five developers like everybody
64:08 - here on this call we're five people who
64:10 - can
64:11 - work from home
64:13 - and i think it it
64:14 - we should it
64:17 - it requires saying that we are extremely
64:19 - fortunate in this regard many many
64:21 - people
64:22 - uh
64:23 - cannot work remotely like
64:26 - many people have to go and deliver
64:29 - packages or they have to
64:32 - work in a logistics center or they have
64:34 - to work in a hospital
64:36 - to help people who are sick
64:38 - many
64:39 - many things do require physically
64:41 - reporting to a specific location at a
64:43 - specific time
64:44 - and there is a tremendous amount of risk
64:46 - associated with that and
64:48 - so
64:49 - i just want to make sure everybody
64:50 - watching realizes that we do
64:53 - feel grateful
64:54 - for that reality and and that uh
64:57 - i i don't want anybody to get the
64:59 - impression that we're you know a bunch
65:00 - of entitled developers talking about how
65:02 - our our productivity's gone down 30 or
65:05 - something like that when people are out
65:06 - there like subjecting themselves to
65:08 - incredible risks uh them and their
65:11 - families uh so
65:13 - um
65:15 - this should not be a dour
65:18 - panel because we should be extremely
65:19 - happy i'm extremely grateful like i i
65:22 - look at like what i was doing before i
65:24 - was running a school i was a school
65:25 - director before i learned to code and
65:26 - became a developer and
65:29 - i had students from all over the world
65:31 - and they would fly in and help with
65:32 - their their visa paperwork and help with
65:36 - you know just
65:38 - monitor the the teaching staff and we
65:40 - had in-person instruction
65:42 - and i think about
65:44 - how
65:46 - that would have completely turned my
65:47 - life upside down like i was working like
65:49 - 50 60 hours a week just making sure all
65:51 - my teachers were happy all instruction
65:53 - all the admin staff were happy
65:56 - have you all worked in fields other than
65:58 - software development where working
66:00 - remotely would not be possible
66:02 - and how do you envision the difference
66:04 - between what life is like right now for
66:06 - you as a developer and what life would
66:09 - be like if you stayed in your old field
66:14 - um so i used to work uh in defense and
66:18 - that was a job where we had to go into
66:19 - the office because of the things we did
66:21 - and you know it's interesting you
66:22 - brought this up because i was just
66:23 - saying to my friend the other day i was
66:26 - saying like
66:27 - i hate to complain at all about the
66:28 - situation because our situation is
66:30 - better than 90 of the people in the
66:32 - world right now um just because of
66:34 - everything you said like i'm so lucky
66:36 - that i made this transition
66:38 - i mean at my old job like
66:40 - i assume we would have lost our jobs
66:41 - like they can't pay you if you know
66:44 - if you can't go to work um and just just
66:47 - even now like because i'm a consultant
66:49 - contractor
66:50 - um i don't know if i'm gonna have a job
66:52 - in three months like i don't know if our
66:54 - current contract our contract was
66:55 - supposed to be renewed but now we're
66:57 - waiting so we don't really know what's
66:58 - gonna happen happen
67:00 - and that's stressful but my partner also
67:02 - works so between we are so we have that
67:04 - safety net of a dual income household
67:06 - but i have so many friends who are
67:08 - independent consultants and contractors
67:10 - where they have one spouse that stays
67:11 - home with the kids and one spouse that
67:12 - works and that anxiety and that stress
67:16 - of like am i gonna have a job in three
67:17 - months like i have to support this
67:19 - family like feed these kids is
67:21 - it can be i mean i just feel like it can
67:22 - be overwhelming
67:28 - yeah i can i can relate to that a little
67:30 - so my first job was in the environmental
67:34 - physics setup so my job is literally to
67:36 - go
67:38 - fill in
67:40 - tests
67:42 - there's a stuff on it to see like how
67:44 - much like co2 in the atmosphere and all
67:45 - of that this was before like i decided
67:48 - that i don't want to do physics anymore
67:50 - uh but what's interesting is like i
67:51 - can't imagine doing that right now
67:54 - because it's like it we needed like
67:55 - these giant instruments that were only
67:58 - there in lab
67:59 - it's like you you just can't have that
68:01 - anymore and like being the most junior
68:03 - person over there i'm pretty sure i'm
68:05 - the first one that would lose the job
68:08 - right if the labs like
68:09 - labs work on like funding and they have
68:11 - to publish research and in time like
68:13 - this there is no research happening like
68:15 - you can't publish anything so if funding
68:18 - gets cut it's it's the it's the people
68:20 - who put the test tubes that lose the job
68:22 - first
68:27 - yeah i used to work in higher ed in just
68:30 - doing like administrative uh
68:32 - office type work and i'd imagine as you
68:35 - know many schools are either closing
68:36 - closed or trying to go online like
68:39 - my job probably would have been
68:41 - eliminated at some point or would be
68:43 - kind of on the edge so yeah definitely
68:45 - feel very
68:46 - fortunate and
68:47 - it's a tough situation for a lot of
68:49 - people in terms of their their work
68:50 - situation
68:54 - yeah and i i know that many people
68:56 - watching this
68:58 - many of your jobs may have evaporated
68:59 - and i just want to emphasize that we
69:02 - uh we want to do everything we can to
69:05 - help you find a new opportunity and i'm
69:08 - hopeful that this uh this conference
69:10 - that we're doing will be helpful in that
69:11 - regard um
69:13 - somebody in in chat uh just said he was
69:15 - laid off two weeks ago uh but that the
69:18 - benefit of being a developer is that he
69:21 - can take an idea or a problem and he can
69:24 - build something that could potentially
69:25 - replace that income
69:27 - so let's talk about work from home tools
69:31 - because that's a huge
69:33 - area of interest right now in terms of
69:35 - like like if you look at the companies
69:36 - that are hiring right now many of them
69:38 - like focus on remote productivity like
69:42 - microsoft teams or slack or zoom or some
69:44 - of these tools
69:46 - what is your work from home
69:48 - tool chain like and and
69:51 - how do you stay productive and work with
69:53 - your colleagues remotely what are the
69:55 - main the main tools you all use
70:03 - well my uh my workpiece is slack for
70:05 - everything so everyone's on slack even
70:07 - before this all happened i think they
70:08 - were
70:09 - they have offices in different parts of
70:11 - the world so
70:12 - they had already kind of had this
70:15 - system set up where everyone can
70:16 - communicate pretty well and everyone
70:17 - sort of knows how to
70:19 - you know do project management and other
70:21 - things um
70:22 - on online which has been pretty great so
70:25 - i think yeah some chat tool whether
70:27 - that's slack or discord or you know
70:29 - maybe even google hangouts i think is
70:31 - super helpful
70:34 - yeah and how about you sid what are you
70:35 - using over at code sandbox
70:37 - um so i guess slack is the common one
70:41 - view is zoom
70:43 - and we've recently gone through a bunch
70:45 - of pair programming apps
70:47 - because everyone that we used was having
70:49 - scaling problems so like our default
70:51 - choices kind of went went away
70:54 - but we've like settled on tuple.app
70:57 - which i think is new to maybe it's not
70:59 - as popular so it's working great for us
71:02 - that plus zoom plus notion
71:05 - it's i i feel like it's mostly
71:06 - communication tools and we're doing a
71:08 - lot of asynchronous communication these
71:10 - days like a bunch of writing more than
71:12 - they've ever done i think this has just
71:13 - made us like better at being remote than
71:16 - we were already
71:20 - interesting so just just to
71:22 - highlight what you just said there
71:23 - working remotely is is kind of increase
71:26 - everybody's average level of
71:27 - communication skills you'd say
71:30 - i mean we we were already remote so we
71:33 - had to communicate a bunch but then you
71:35 - always had the option that you know you
71:37 - could ping someone and
71:39 - you could say let's let's chart it this
71:41 - time or let's get on the zoom call right
71:43 - but even though we're like relatively
71:45 - close by like i think everyone in the
71:46 - team is in europe they're kind of
71:48 - working different time zones because
71:50 - somebody has a kid and then they have to
71:52 - you know sometimes they have to take the
71:54 - morning while their partner takes the
71:55 - evening so it's like everyone's schedule
71:58 - has kind of been just thrown off
72:00 - so now it's most of the conversations
72:03 - are asynchronous and i think
72:05 - we've gotten into a good habit of
72:07 - documenting and just like passing on
72:09 - thoughts processing them and then
72:11 - sharing them
72:12 - otherwise we would just like get on a
72:14 - zoom call and treat it like a
72:17 - tap on the shoulder
72:21 - yeah and how about you colleen what kind
72:23 - of tools are you all using
72:25 - so my teams use slack and zoom and
72:27 - whereby and google hangouts if we're
72:29 - feeling lazy um so just just those kind
72:32 - of communication tools i think because i
72:34 - this one team i'm working with um
72:36 - i i agree that this has actually helped
72:38 - us become more communicative
72:40 - which i think has been great for our
72:43 - team we're more likely to kind of jump
72:45 - on a screen share than we were before
72:46 - this happened which i'm not exactly sure
72:49 - why um
72:51 - but but that yeah so that's worked
72:52 - pretty well for us
72:55 - okay awesome it sounds like somebody
72:56 - might be washing dishes in the
72:58 - background
73:00 - uh if
73:01 - if your partner's washing dishes please
73:03 - mute um
73:04 - so
73:05 - uh
73:07 - one question we have from uh
73:10 - uh
73:11 - chat
73:12 - that i really want to highlight elliot
73:13 - sanford uh long time freako camp uh
73:16 - remember i think he's at a coding
73:17 - bootcamp right now too um
73:20 - elliott says how are you able to cope
73:22 - with being a parent and spouse but also
73:25 - able to learn and work from home and
73:28 - what do you do to keep work from taking
73:30 - over i'm struggling here so
73:32 - balancing familial obligations with
73:35 - um
73:36 - just
73:37 - uh work in general and the diffuse
73:39 - nature of working from home i should say
73:41 - yeah i i mean we i'm i'm struggling with
73:44 - this right because usually my kids are
73:45 - in school um and so it's been a month
73:47 - we've been on lockdown here for a month
73:50 - and
73:51 - at first i tried to like set the kids up
73:53 - with their work and work on my laptop by
73:55 - then but i found that my children are i
73:58 - guess too young they need more focused
74:00 - attention so for me it's really about
74:02 - managing my expectations so part of the
74:04 - reason i'm a contractor so i have free
74:06 - time to work on side projects as you
74:08 - mentioned earlier quincy someone said he
74:10 - got laid off and he was going to start
74:11 - building something that's amazing and
74:13 - that's what i do for fun
74:14 - and i have just accepted the fact that
74:17 - until we're out of lockdown like i just
74:20 - cannot do it i just don't have time like
74:22 - i will lose my sanity if i do it i mean
74:25 - you know i have to let some do you just
74:27 - have to let something go i think and so
74:29 - what we do here is i take the kids
74:31 - except for today of course i usually
74:33 - take the kids from 6 a.m to 1 p.m
74:36 - and then my partner takes them in the
74:37 - afternoon and then i supplement work in
74:40 - the night you know after hours um as
74:43 - needed
74:44 - but but it's hard and i think you know
74:46 - we don't know how long this is going to
74:47 - go on for so i think it's it's really
74:49 - important to although you have to work
74:51 - nights to probably meet your deadlines
74:53 - and continue your learning like don't
74:55 - burn yourself out um try to remember to
74:57 - take breaks try to like block i think
75:00 - it's about expectation management too
75:02 - like if you're gonna do kids from six to
75:04 - one like block out that time for them
75:05 - and just accept
75:07 - you're not gonna get any work done
75:08 - during that time but i mean i don't have
75:11 - a great solution like i think you know
75:13 - i'm just figuring it out
75:17 - yeah
75:19 - how about you jessica inter i know like
75:22 - how are you coping with the balance the
75:24 - work-life balance when work and life are
75:26 - happening in the same space
75:28 - yeah i mean my husband and i don't have
75:30 - kids so i think that's one
75:32 - i think big difference from my situation
75:35 - but i do know that when i first moved
75:38 - from working in a physical office to
75:40 - working remotely that was like a huge
75:42 - transition and it honestly not to like
75:45 - scare people it probably took me a year
75:46 - before i felt like comfortable and
75:49 - productive i was just like supe i felt
75:51 - very unproductive um and i felt like
75:54 - during work hours i would be distracted
75:56 - and i wouldn't really be able to focus
75:58 - on my work but then i would have to
76:00 - catch up on my work during the evening
76:02 - time when i should be sort of relaxing
76:04 - and getting ready for the next day so
76:05 - and kind of what colleen was saying in
76:07 - terms of time blocking
76:09 - is you know even if it's not nine to
76:11 - five hours try to when you're working be
76:13 - 100 working as much as possible of
76:15 - course and then when you're not working
76:17 - try not to let work sort of creep in but
76:20 - even if you're catching up on your work
76:22 - you know in the evening times i think
76:23 - you can still at least try to
76:26 - whatever current task you're doing sort
76:28 - of try to stay focused on that as much
76:29 - as you as much as possible
76:35 - yeah i can relate to that so
76:37 - um i had to learn the same way like when
76:39 - i started working i was either totally
76:42 - unproductive or i was working all the
76:44 - time i kind of like juggled between the
76:47 - two before i found a balance and what's
76:49 - been interesting is that like last month
76:52 - when i when my wife started working from
76:54 - home
76:54 - all of that balance kind of went out the
76:56 - window and we had to discover it all
76:58 - over again
76:59 - and i saw her working all the time and i
77:02 - was like what do i do so i also like the
77:05 - options were look at twitter look at the
77:07 - news or lose yourself and work so i
77:10 - think the first three weeks we just
77:12 - worked like all day all night
77:14 - but recently like with finally like it
77:17 - took three weeks to adjust but i think
77:18 - we've found a balance where
77:20 - uh we have a few things to work like we
77:23 - have certain workers and then we also
77:25 - know when to call it a day and that's
77:27 - the funny thing with remote like you
77:29 - don't see people walking out of the
77:31 - office or you don't like nobody tells
77:33 - you that it's time so you kind of just
77:35 - have to set a boundary for yourself and
77:37 - if you're in the floor if you're dealing
77:39 - with like a bug that you just can't fix
77:41 - and you want to get it done sometimes
77:43 - you just have to say
77:44 - it's 6 p.m
77:46 - i did what i could do today i'm gonna
77:48 - try again tomorrow
77:50 - and one thing that has really helped
77:51 - with this which which is new to me like
77:53 - i i did not do this earlier but it's new
77:55 - now because i found these
77:57 - escapes right and it can be like a
78:00 - productive escape like a side project so
78:02 - i've started working on a side project
78:04 - i'm super efficient with that now or it
78:06 - could be something which is not so
78:08 - productive like playing animal crossing
78:10 - right but just having something to look
78:12 - forward to in the evening like when you
78:15 - say
78:15 - like people talk about blocking time for
78:17 - work i started blocking time for not
78:19 - work so like three hours in the evening
78:22 - i'm either gonna work on my side project
78:23 - or play video game and because i'm
78:25 - looking forward to that i'm more
78:27 - motivated to finish my work during the
78:30 - day so that we can you know do stuff do
78:33 - something in the evening like we've been
78:35 - so many shows on netflix and
78:37 - it's it's fine
78:39 - like that's what helps the rest get done
78:41 - exactly my pet is super happy right now
78:44 - i'm spending more time with my cat
78:46 - taking her to walk so it's like no
78:49 - lockdown for her but it's locked down
78:50 - for me
78:54 - so yeah uh developers uh need to uh
78:57 - utilize this time that they have got uh
78:59 - and then they
79:00 - make best use of it and also balance it
79:04 - out between work and
79:05 - the home life
79:09 - right
79:10 - yeah and
79:11 - let's talk about time and the
79:13 - temporality of working from home because
79:17 - a lot of if you're no longer in an
79:19 - office you're no longer like how many of
79:21 - your meetings
79:22 - are synchronous where you're all talking
79:24 - like at the same time
79:26 - uh where you have like a scheduled
79:28 - meeting like what percentage of your day
79:30 - would you say is is actually
79:32 - has to be a
79:35 - tackled at a specific time versus like
79:37 - just an open-ended block of time that
79:39 - you could potentially shift to nighttime
79:41 - when your kids are asleep for example uh
79:43 - or other times like uh
79:46 - yeah
79:47 - we'll start with you uh colleen like
79:52 - what percentage of your day is
79:55 - strictly regimented to specific times
79:58 - um very little in terms of my work like
80:00 - we have
80:01 - um you know so most of my co-workers on
80:04 - for this team i'm on now on the west
80:05 - coast um so i prefer to you know kind of
80:08 - it works better for me to work later
80:10 - hours but we're completely asynchronous
80:12 - with slack so
80:13 - um i'm totally flexible there
80:17 - okay and how about you um jessica
80:21 - most yeah most of the communication with
80:23 - my team is probably asynchronous as well
80:25 - but there are i do have a few meetings
80:27 - per week where we try to be it has to be
80:30 - everybody at the same time but we're in
80:33 - relatively all the same time zones so
80:34 - it's not too much of a problem
80:38 - yeah and instead with uh
80:40 - yeah i mean how big is the code sandbox
80:42 - team because i talked to the founder of
80:43 - code sandbox like a year or two ago and
80:45 - it's grown so much
80:47 - yeah i mean i mean so much is relative i
80:50 - think when you talked with four people
80:52 - now it's nine
80:54 - but it's still a pretty tiny team
80:56 - uh what's been interesting is that we do
80:58 - the we do a daily stand up every day
81:00 - i've done it since the start
81:02 - and it's one of those like it's super
81:04 - optional oh i love this
81:06 - this reminds me of the
81:08 - famous kid walking
81:11 - sorry i knew this was to happen that we
81:13 - just moved into a new place and that
81:15 - door doesn't lie
81:18 - did you find this
81:21 - hang on it's very appropriate this is
81:22 - what we're all living with right now
81:24 - okay
81:27 - this is real life
81:28 - yep
81:29 - okay he's gonna hang out he's not gonna
81:31 - touch the keyboard or anything um he'll
81:33 - just be here for a few minutes until
81:34 - he's bored okay so
81:37 - um
81:38 - sorry for the interruption i i
81:40 - anticipated that might happen my wife
81:41 - has been kind of like on standby to
81:43 - prevent that but the kids are very wily
81:47 - it's very welcome i've met like my in my
81:50 - team i've met all the kids all the pets
81:52 - like this is like if a cat comes
81:54 - crawling here you just let it be it's
81:56 - fine
81:57 - this is part of the part of your team
81:58 - now
81:59 - yeah
82:00 - yes i was talking about the stand-up so
82:02 - we decided a long back like a while back
82:05 - they do a daily stand up and it wasn't
82:07 - so much to sync up on work it was mostly
82:09 - to see each other's faces
82:11 - and now more than ever that's been
82:13 - really useful
82:14 - that i think we've increased our
82:16 - meetings now because it just kind of
82:18 - helps to pair on something like we had
82:21 - so many meetings where we just spare
82:22 - even if it's like anyone can solve the
82:25 - problem we would just pair to do it
82:26 - together because it's like a it's like a
82:29 - reminder that we work together and
82:31 - honestly it's kind of nice to fade into
82:33 - like api details and not worry about
82:35 - like the
82:37 - looming thing in the background of your
82:38 - head
82:40 - yeah and we have a question from the
82:42 - chat for you sid uh
82:43 - uh leonardo uh gallante is asking uh
82:47 - what is the pair programming tool that
82:49 - you all use currently
82:52 - um so we use code sandbox uh paired with
82:56 - tuple
82:58 - tuple okay cool and code sandbox of
83:01 - course
83:02 - i think does it support uh multiple
83:04 - people editing uh a sandbox at the same
83:07 - time
83:08 - yeah you can invite someone and then do
83:09 - the dual cursor thingy
83:12 - yeah
83:13 - yeah so your whole team remote
83:16 - okay i mean there are three people in
83:18 - amsterdam but then
83:22 - right yeah
83:23 - so you're able to dog food your own
83:24 - product dog fooding being like you eat
83:26 - your own dog food
83:28 - you're able to use code sandbox to work
83:30 - on code sandbox
83:32 - yep yep
83:33 - that's somewhere
83:36 - it gets hard sometimes yeah
83:41 - all right so what advice do you have for
83:43 - companies who are
83:45 - trying to get used to this work from
83:47 - home environment so as said you have
83:49 - spoken about stand-ups so how can
83:52 - companies effectively do stand-ups
83:54 - should it be like 15 minutes 45 minutes
83:56 - one hour two hours because i have heard
83:58 - companies staying online and coding live
84:01 - so is that the right thing or what is
84:03 - the right thing here
84:08 - i i can start so yeah i don't think
84:11 - there's any right or wrong per se
84:14 - right like i think like stand-ups are
84:16 - great to just get everyone in the room
84:18 - uh where stand-ups i've seen gone wrong
84:21 - is where you just start trying to solve
84:23 - problems in the stand-up itself right
84:26 - right it's nice to just catch up with
84:27 - everyone which for us with like super
84:29 - tiny so it takes 10 minutes but like
84:32 - depending on how many people in the room
84:33 - you can go on for like 20 25 minutes
84:36 - uh but then what's useful is that you
84:38 - don't try to do things there
84:40 - and instead break out into different
84:42 - rooms so a lot of times our standups end
84:44 - with somebody saying somebody asking the
84:47 - other person to stay back because they
84:48 - have a question for them
84:50 - and everyone else just says buys and
84:51 - goes away and the two people stay on for
84:54 - the call for longer
84:57 - yes
84:59 - how about you jessica
85:02 - um yeah i mean i think this is one of
85:04 - those questions where the the correct
85:05 - answer is it depends but
85:08 - you know i think um
85:10 - yeah i think just trying to effectively
85:12 - and efficiently run your meetings
85:13 - whether they're in person or online is
85:15 - really important because you know if you
85:16 - have a giant zoom call with like 25
85:18 - people i think you may not be able to be
85:20 - as productive as you could if you you
85:22 - know um
85:23 - split up into different rooms
85:25 - and also maybe being mindful of the the
85:27 - amount of bandwidth that's available for
85:29 - zoom worldwide and other places
85:32 - so yeah
85:38 - yeah and colleen did you have anything
85:39 - you wanted to add on this
85:41 - oh right i believe in over communication
85:44 - in this situation um
85:46 - now our team has always been remote but
85:48 - like i i liked i love sid actually i
85:51 - love the idea of a daily 10-minute stand
85:53 - up because i'm an extrovert and like
85:55 - i've been in this house for four weeks
85:57 - so i'm like talk to me someone talk to
85:59 - me um so i love that but uh we're trying
86:02 - to move towards more towards a more
86:04 - communicative model because we've just i
86:06 - mean we also have a really small team
86:08 - and the code base is small so we're like
86:10 - stepping on each other's toes sometimes
86:12 - if we don't communicate enough um so i
86:14 - just think it's a situation where you
86:15 - over communicate i love the daily
86:17 - standup idea i'm gonna suggest that to
86:19 - the guys i work with
86:20 - and um you know the the slack messages
86:23 - and just just a lot of communication
86:25 - because you're not there you can't go
86:27 - look over someone's shoulder and be like
86:28 - oh you're working on this i'm working on
86:30 - the same thing well that's you know
86:32 - project management so
86:36 - so how frequently do you think companies
86:38 - should uh discuss um their updates with
86:42 - the developers like in a day like is
86:44 - stand up the only thing like
86:46 - calling like how what process do you
86:48 - follow in your company like do they meet
86:50 - multiple times in a day or do they meet
86:53 - twice like in the in the morning or and
86:55 - once in the
86:56 - by the end of the day
86:58 - so we don't do daily meetings um we just
87:01 - do all our communication on trello and
87:03 - slack and a call like if necessary um
87:06 - but i like i said i would actually i'm
87:08 - actually going to push to do a little
87:09 - bit more because i think it's hard to
87:12 - manage you know you guys know like you
87:13 - have github issues you got trello issues
87:15 - you got jira who knows where interests
87:17 - are so
87:18 - i i think it's better i mean i think
87:20 - like maybe even a daily like we don't
87:23 - have um someone that is just a program
87:25 - manager so everyone manages their own
87:27 - issues and so
87:29 - we only have we have maybe like priority
87:32 - issues once a week where we get together
87:34 - and talk about like is the priority
87:36 - still the same coming from the customer
87:38 - um
87:39 - so that's kind of what we've been doing
87:41 - great yeah
87:43 - and as far as uh like physical space so
87:47 - i know you all are working
87:48 - from home uh in some cities people are
87:51 - fortunate enough to be able to have like
87:53 - multi-room
87:54 - setups i used to live in san francisco
87:56 - and we lived in a uh and like maybe 700
87:59 - square feet with uh with the two with
88:01 - the little baby and it was uh i can only
88:04 - imagine what it's like to be going
88:06 - through that sort of situation right now
88:07 - during the pandemic hit the pandemic
88:09 - just had the dice rolled differently in
88:11 - the pandemic hit when i was still living
88:12 - in there my life would be very different
88:14 - from being in kind of a texas standard
88:17 - issue house
88:19 - but uh but for those of you who do have
88:23 - you know more than one room or different
88:25 - spaces around the house do you delegate
88:27 - a specific room for like okay i'm in
88:29 - work mode now
88:31 - uh and
88:32 - how do you go about deciding which space
88:34 - you use for what and do you have any
88:36 - hard and fast rules that you apply
88:40 - for that
88:42 - sure yeah i mean i i also am fortunate
88:45 - to live in a relatively low cost of
88:47 - living part of the country and so i do
88:49 - have a dedicated office which i'm
88:51 - extremely fortunate to have so
88:54 - yeah as much as possible i try to limit
88:57 - myself you know in the physical space to
88:59 - just do work in the office so like i'll
89:01 - i'll never do work on my couch or my bed
89:05 - of course part of that's probably
89:06 - because i have an external monitor that
89:07 - i'm completely addicted to but you know
89:10 - i think i think it is important to you
89:12 - know if you're working from home keep
89:14 - have a dedicated area even if it's just
89:16 - like your dining table um during certain
89:18 - parts of the day dedicated to work
89:25 - yeah that that's been interesting so
89:27 - like this room is was used to be my
89:29 - office and i've i'm the same like i've
89:31 - been lucky enough that i was already set
89:33 - up for this so i didn't have to change
89:35 - much
89:36 - what's different is that now this is
89:38 - also my wife's office
89:40 - right so then we have to take turns so
89:42 - now the dining table has kind of become
89:45 - the other office
89:47 - and the couch in this room has become
89:49 - where we have dinner right so it kind of
89:51 - had to repurpose the house because it's
89:53 - either the dining table or the bed and i
89:55 - know i'm not gonna get anything done
89:57 - from the bed
89:58 - like
89:59 - the dining table is the office desk now
90:02 - and the couch is where we have our
90:04 - dinner so you have to like change it up
90:06 - a little but
90:07 - i think like just just defining those
90:09 - spaces was really helpful
90:12 - um because it takes a while like it took
90:14 - us two weeks but now we're now i sit on
90:16 - the dining table and i know it's the
90:18 - place where i work and not where i eat
90:20 - food
90:22 - so that helps me get into the zone as
90:24 - well
90:25 - right
90:26 - so one question uh that somebody has
90:28 - asked me on twitter is
90:31 - what do you think that companies are uh
90:34 - actually cautious about their ip being
90:36 - late uh their ideas being leaked because
90:38 - as cdo said like you and your wife are
90:40 - working in two different companies and
90:42 - uh
90:44 - so the projects that you are working on
90:46 - so how do how do how should developers
90:49 - manage this like
90:51 - how can they take care of this thing
90:53 - because sometimes companies are very
90:55 - cautious about their ideas their
90:57 - projects that they are currently working
90:59 - on should not be linked to others so
91:01 - what do you have to say about that
91:06 - are they concerned about leaking by like
91:08 - someone talking to their friend about
91:10 - the project or is it more like a
91:11 - security like a hack type i i don't know
91:14 - just the idea being discussed with
91:16 - someone else or a person from another
91:18 - company
91:21 - yeah so i guess a lot of discussions
91:23 - might have previously taken place in
91:25 - secure rooms especially like you know
91:27 - colleen mentioned she was in defense and
91:29 - i imagine they have all kinds of
91:30 - additional layers of security there but
91:32 - uh
91:33 - if if you're at home there could be like
91:35 - an alexa unit that's just passively
91:38 - listening and we don't know like
91:40 - whether that is actually being
91:41 - transcribed somewhere
91:42 - same thing with like people's phones and
91:44 - stuff like all the traditional security
91:47 - when you're on a meeting you know things
91:48 - could be said that uh could be recorded
91:50 - somewhere else or people could hear
91:52 - about
91:53 - or if you and your spouse are in the
91:55 - same industry
91:56 - then you know competitive information
91:58 - might inadvertently be shared that uh
92:01 - you know so i guess
92:03 - i'm not sure if this affects any of you
92:04 - all but uh d do your companies have any
92:07 - sort of policies or are they even
92:08 - thinking about these things at this
92:09 - point i imagine there are lots of other
92:11 - things they're thinking about
92:12 - [Music]
92:13 - i mean i i guess it's brave to assume
92:16 - that
92:17 - my wife already doesn't know everything
92:19 - about my work
92:20 - [Laughter]
92:22 - like being at home it doesn't really
92:23 - give an advantage but i do understand
92:25 - where the question is coming from so
92:27 - like uh before this like a long time ago
92:30 - i used to work for a healthcare startup
92:32 - and there were a bunch of rules about uh
92:34 - personal information like health data is
92:36 - kind of like very private and stuff so
92:39 - uh just for like for checking off all
92:42 - the
92:43 - things in the security audit we were
92:45 - supposed to have uh like what we call
92:47 - fingerprint scanners in the office and
92:49 - you weren't allowed to take any hardware
92:51 - outside of the office so there's like a
92:53 - bunch of
92:54 - rules
92:55 - and i imagine any company that requires
92:58 - you to like log in from a certain
92:59 - terminal all of that now is up up in the
93:01 - air right you work with whatever thing
93:03 - you have at home
93:04 - and
93:05 - like i
93:07 - like if i was still at zero maybe they
93:09 - would have a very good answer because
93:10 - they kind of are a security company but
93:13 - with code sandbox like the more we do in
93:15 - the open the better it is for us so i
93:18 - it's something that i've just like
93:20 - forgotten about
93:24 - yeah
93:25 - well let's talk about let's move to the
93:26 - staying sane part uh
93:28 - of working from home productively
93:30 - because i think it's clear that you all
93:32 - are working productively it sounds like
93:35 - things are still getting done
93:36 - uh most of you were already working from
93:38 - home before so it's just the same
93:40 - routine probably just compressed time i
93:43 - would imagine with uh other
93:45 - responsibilities and also
93:48 - i guess one question is like a lot of
93:50 - you have colleagues who weren't working
93:51 - from home
93:52 - uh and now they are and suddenly they're
93:55 - having to rapidly spool up on what you
93:58 - all had already kind of intuited
94:00 - about successfully working from home
94:02 - what would be your advice to your
94:04 - colleagues uh and have you given any
94:06 - advice to colleagues or that who've
94:08 - approached you and said like oh i know
94:09 - you work from home like how can i do
94:10 - this right like what would be your quick
94:13 - and dirty tips uh for successfully
94:16 - working from home if a colleague
94:17 - approached you and asked you
94:19 - colleen
94:20 - so i have a lot of tips
94:22 - because i feel like jessica it took me
94:24 - maybe a year to kind of like figure this
94:26 - out
94:27 - um so i think you have to remember to
94:29 - we're in the middle of a pandemic so as
94:31 - we discussed at the beginning of this
94:33 - your mental and emotional state aren't
94:35 - going to be what they would be otherwise
94:37 - so you need to be mindful of that but
94:39 - like practical tips are this um you're
94:41 - at home so you don't have the natural
94:43 - breaks that you would have in an office
94:45 - so do a pomodoro timer you can actually
94:48 - see my yoga mat behind me because i do
94:50 - 25 minutes of work and then five minutes
94:52 - of stretching um and i do that all day
94:55 - but um i would recommend that to force
94:57 - breaks first give your eyes a break
94:59 - just give yourself a little break i also
95:02 - recommend during that time do not get on
95:04 - social media because that will distract
95:05 - your brain from whatever you were
95:07 - working on before
95:08 - so i like to take those five minutes of
95:10 - break time and like i said like do yoga
95:13 - or you know throw a load of laundry in
95:14 - or something like that um and then the
95:16 - time blocking we talked about earlier i
95:18 - thought was um was really good that
95:21 - really helps and then so what i do kind
95:23 - of like the office i also have an office
95:25 - and i use my noise cancelling headphones
95:27 - like you guys have on and that kind of
95:28 - puts me in like the mental work state
95:30 - like when i even though i don't always
95:32 - turn them on like if they're on my ears
95:34 - like i know i'm supposed to be working
95:37 - so i think actually someone in the last
95:39 - chat talked about atomic habits but um
95:42 - james clear talks about that in his book
95:44 - as having these habit cues and so for me
95:46 - one of my habit cues is noise canceling
95:48 - headphones so that really helps
95:52 - okay awesome noise cancelling headphones
95:54 - pomodoro technique
95:56 - um
95:57 - having something you can do during that
95:59 - that uh break time during the pomodoro
96:01 - to and and staying away from social
96:03 - media during breaks because who you know
96:05 - for the second you landed twitter
96:06 - trending it's just it's all over like
96:08 - you're like what's that oh my gosh is
96:10 - that really happening
96:12 - is is the real world really this
96:13 - horrible
96:16 - now um
96:17 - how about you jessica what would you how
96:20 - would you advise a colleague who just
96:23 - realized that they have to work from
96:24 - home uh for the first time
96:26 - yeah i think i mean colin has some
96:28 - really excellent tips i think just
96:30 - to add to that i'd say maybe
96:32 - one is take breaks like i tried to get
96:35 - out of the house and take a brief walk a
96:37 - couple times a day obviously you know
96:39 - following whatever guidelines are in
96:40 - place for where you live
96:43 - and i think
96:44 - it's
96:45 - really hard for people who
96:47 - were working in a physical office until
96:49 - recently
96:50 - to feel connected especially if you're
96:52 - more on the extroverted side so one
96:54 - thing that i've been doing with
96:55 - colleagues is
96:57 - actually doing zoom meetings just to
96:58 - kind of catch up so like we'll do like a
97:00 - virtual coffee break a couple times a
97:02 - week
97:03 - if any of you have played jack box it's
97:05 - like a game you can play over zoom
97:07 - relatively easily if you share your
97:08 - screen just like a group game everyone
97:10 - plays um
97:11 - on their phone and so it's just kind of
97:13 - a fun way to have a little break in the
97:15 - day kind of get maybe some of that
97:17 - energy the social energy back
97:21 - okay great um and
97:25 - uh how about you sid
97:27 - yeah what advice would you have for a
97:28 - colleague
97:30 - everything jessica and coin said uh the
97:33 - only thing i'd add is
97:35 - like i first of all i really like what
97:36 - jessica said because it's something that
97:39 - i have started doing too and it's like
97:41 - i'm not extroverted
97:44 - but this is also not my happy place
97:47 - right like even as an introvert being
97:49 - logged in your house is not what
97:50 - introverts want right like i like the
97:53 - choice of going to a party i just don't
97:54 - like going to parties right
97:58 - but what i've like
97:59 - what i've been enjoying which is new for
98:01 - me is exactly what she said just calling
98:03 - up your co-workers just to have a chat
98:06 - which is not about work right just
98:07 - asking them how they're holding up what
98:09 - are they up to and just just the fact
98:11 - that we're all doing this together at
98:14 - the same time
98:15 - kind of takes away a lot of guilt that i
98:18 - get for like not being efficient or not
98:20 - working
98:21 - and i think more than like getting the
98:22 - work done getting away from the guilt
98:24 - has been really helpful for me
98:26 - and that kind of motivates me to get
98:29 - back to work uh
98:31 - practical tips what i like is like i'm
98:33 - kind of obsessed with blocking time
98:35 - so like early in the morning or like the
98:38 - night before i'll plan out what do i
98:40 - want to do the next day and then in the
98:42 - morning i'll just have blocks of time
98:44 - like this is this is when i make lunch
98:47 - right this is when my meeting is this is
98:49 - what i try to get done and then just
98:51 - making sure i have
98:53 - at least a few giant chunks of time
98:55 - where i can actually write code uh is is
98:58 - kind of crucial for me
99:00 - and
99:01 - the the last thing i would add is having
99:03 - like a
99:04 - ritual almost like a habit thing like we
99:07 - we think that we can hustle our way
99:09 - through this right like we all we lack
99:11 - is motivation to work it honestly like
99:14 - our brains are stupider than that so we
99:16 - really have to like pull them into it so
99:18 - i really like having like a morning
99:21 - start work routine where it's like i
99:23 - open a notepad i look at my tasks and i
99:25 - just write for 15 minutes and that kind
99:28 - of gets me in the in the headspace to
99:30 - start work instead of you know thinking
99:33 - about twitter or
99:34 - recently thinking about tick tock
99:36 - because that's what it has come to
99:38 - and in
99:42 - taking a walk so this was like my pre
99:44 - uh lockdown routine where i would just
99:47 - to
99:47 - end work i would go for a 15 minute work
99:50 - now that 15 minute has become i just
99:52 - like
99:53 - stretch on or do some exercise on my
99:56 - wife's yoga mat so it's like just having
99:58 - these tiny events or like tiny
100:01 - actions that kind of say that okay this
100:04 - ends my work day and now i'm ready for
100:06 - like the other stuff has kind of been
100:08 - useful to
100:09 - fool my brain into it like stop thinking
100:11 - about work start thinking about your
100:12 - wife now
100:16 - right on well one thing that i think we
100:18 - would be remiss not to cover is how
100:21 - is this pandemic going to affect the
100:23 - future of work
100:24 - um how is this experience of social
100:27 - distancing
100:28 - and basically
100:30 - all of us working from home during this
100:32 - period like do you think that people are
100:34 - going to go back to offices
100:36 - everything's just going to go back to
100:38 - normal and snap back the moment that a
100:40 - vaccine comes out and is widely
100:42 - available and we're all safely able to
100:44 - just return to the office like do you
100:46 - think that that is going to happen or do
100:48 - you think that this is going to cause
100:50 - some permanent waves
100:57 - well i think it will cause permanent
100:59 - waves because i think
101:01 - without a pandemic
101:03 - generally obviously depends on the
101:05 - person but working from home is just so
101:07 - much better
101:09 - so
101:10 - you know i'm in this social slack group
101:11 - with some friends and one of the guys
101:13 - is disabled and he's been telling he was
101:15 - telling us like for years he's a web
101:17 - developer for years company with
101:19 - companies wouldn't hire him because they
101:21 - said you can't work remotely and now
101:23 - surprise everyone can work remotely
101:25 - so you know that's frustrating for him
101:27 - but he's also he also thinks it's
101:28 - wonderful because he's like the whole
101:29 - disabled
101:31 - tech community
101:32 - now has been given more opportunities to
101:34 - work from home something they were told
101:35 - they couldn't do
101:37 - um and i mean i think for everyone most
101:39 - people again remote work is just it's
101:41 - just better so i think a lot of people
101:43 - are gonna push to keep it if they can
101:45 - and it's cheaper for the company right
101:47 - like office space in manhattan
101:49 - you know
101:53 - right many developers are going to
101:55 - realize that they are actually more
101:56 - productive now and hopefully after the
101:59 - lockdown they are going to request their
102:02 - employers to
102:04 - like allow them to work from home
102:06 - yeah i think so
102:08 - i'm kind of like
102:10 - double minded on that because i think a
102:12 - lot of developers would like it because
102:14 - it kind of takes away the skepticism
102:15 - they had right like i've talked to a
102:17 - bunch of friends who said this would
102:18 - never work right are they like no i'm an
102:21 - extrovert i need people around me but
102:23 - now that they're forced into it they
102:25 - were forced to also look at the good
102:27 - sides along with the bad side so i have
102:29 - a feeling like at least a bunch of
102:30 - developers would want to do it yes i'm
102:33 - also afraid that a lot of
102:35 - like higher ups in the team right would
102:39 - look at this and say we tried remote
102:41 - work it wasn't as productive right like
102:43 - this was this would be the bad case
102:45 - study
102:46 - yeah
102:47 - where the truth is like nobody is
102:48 - productive right
102:50 - so i think i think it would definitely
102:53 - increase the number of chances so if
102:55 - you're a company that can go remote i
102:57 - think you'll just
102:58 - there would be more demand for remote
103:00 - work and you can just capitalize on that
103:04 - by all people to work remotely and your
103:06 - folks would like having the choice i
103:08 - think would be the difference yeah
103:12 - so i have a question for you guys for uh
103:14 - do you guys have people in an office
103:16 - anywhere press both for sid and jessica
103:19 - are you is your company fully remote
103:20 - because i always have i have this theory
103:22 - that a pack of people are in the office
103:24 - and you're remote then it's bad for the
103:25 - remote person and i'm wondering if
103:27 - that's true
103:28 - right i think it depends on the company
103:30 - my company is
103:32 - majority in office so i was working
103:35 - remotely even before
103:37 - i am a minority but
103:38 - um
103:39 - i think that
103:41 - it really depends on the company they've
103:42 - done just such a great job of making
103:44 - remote remote employees feel on the same
103:47 - level as like the in person obviously
103:49 - you know we miss out on some of the
103:50 - water cooler chat and some other you
103:52 - know talking about projects that might
103:54 - come up but for the most part it's been
103:56 - done well so i think it may depend on
103:58 - the company
104:01 - yeah i can relate to that so i think it
104:03 - depends on like how how seriously does
104:05 - the company want to take it so at odd
104:08 - zero i was working with a i want to say
104:10 - 13 our time difference
104:12 - um like most of my team was in the honor
104:14 - service in argentina so even though they
104:17 - were all remote they were kind of in the
104:18 - same time zone um
104:21 - so what was interesting was
104:23 - that the team kind of had a rule that if
104:25 - they're having a meeting with one person
104:27 - remote they'll just go sit in different
104:29 - corners of the office and all join by a
104:31 - zoom so i think just having it's like
104:34 - treating everyone as equal was kind of
104:37 - the point and even if a decision is made
104:39 - in person where for example like a lot
104:41 - of time people would meet in the office
104:43 - when i'm just sleeping
104:44 - but they'll make sure they document it
104:46 - and they put it in a dock where we just
104:48 - like chew on it for a while and comment
104:50 - on it to to get the conversation so i
104:52 - think a lot of it is like i'm sure a lot
104:55 - of companies are bad when they start and
104:57 - then they learn this through the times
104:59 - and then like just having a mature
105:01 - process around it really helps
105:03 - uh right now at code sandbox we do have
105:06 - an office which is like it's it's we
105:09 - call it an office it's a room in a
105:10 - co-working space right so sometimes when
105:13 - we feel like seeing each other's faces
105:15 - we just end up going there so like we
105:17 - have three people in amsterdam including
105:18 - me so we end up meeting each other once
105:21 - a week and then
105:23 - every month one or two people from
105:26 - around europe just like flies in to
105:28 - spend some time in the office and that's
105:30 - more of like a social thing
105:33 - than uh it's like like there are there
105:35 - are co-workers that i've never met in
105:36 - person which kind of feels weird so this
105:39 - helps that once in a while you just get
105:41 - to sit next to them and you know i don't
105:43 - know look at look that they actually
105:45 - have legs an artist
105:49 - just an insight from chat jesse weigel
105:52 - uh frequent uh youtube streamer here on
105:55 - the free cocaine channel on a prolific
105:57 - dev he said uh he often feels that uh
106:00 - it's difficult to participate in a
106:01 - meeting when he's working remotely and
106:04 - everybody else is in an office and and
106:07 - being the remote person is kind of like
106:09 - you're you're the outsider and there
106:10 - have been studies conducted i think
106:12 - stanford did a study of remote work in
106:14 - china and they found that it's harder to
106:15 - get like you're just as productive as
106:18 - everybody else or maybe more productive
106:19 - because you don't have to spend a lot of
106:20 - time commuting but uh you are less
106:23 - likely to be promoted because the work
106:25 - you're doing isn't as visible as the
106:26 - people in the office
106:27 - so we could talk about this for another
106:29 - hour uh this has been fantastic i've
106:32 - learned so much i've gotten so much
106:34 - insight and i i think it's going to
106:36 - change how i personally work from home
106:38 - especially a lot of the insights i've
106:39 - gotten you know from uh from colleen
106:42 - who's done this for so long and it's
106:44 - great hearing how uh
106:46 - how sid and how um jessica's
106:49 - organizations are approaching this as
106:50 - well uh this is almost a reckoning for
106:53 - everybody who is previously like uh not
106:56 - working remotely and working with other
106:57 - people remotely now there's going to be
106:59 - a lot more empathy i think going forward
107:01 - when they're working with colleagues who
107:03 - work from home because hey
107:04 - everybody's going to have had that
107:06 - experience
107:07 - right it'll be it'll be kind of a
107:08 - permanent uh memory uh that will persist
107:12 - and hopefully
107:13 - you know
107:15 - make people more empathetic going
107:16 - forward so
107:18 - um
107:19 - i'm hopeful that that is one silver
107:21 - lining that'll come out of this i just
107:23 - want to thank you all uh all three of
107:25 - you for coming on it's been phenomenal
107:27 - uh
107:28 - as i said i've learned so much i've been
107:30 - sharing some insights in chat and over
107:32 - on
107:33 - twitter and everybody who's watching
107:35 - this and hears like a you know a really
107:37 - compelling thing like the point colleen
107:40 - made about people who were previously
107:42 - told they couldn't
107:43 - get a job because they couldn't work
107:45 - remotely because you can't work remotely
107:48 - if you're if you have a disability that
107:49 - requires you to stay home hey
107:52 - like
107:52 - there's a proof of concept now that work
107:55 - can be done remotely so therefore
107:57 - hopefully this is you know a huge boon
107:59 - to people in the disabled community who
108:02 - are who are interested in uh getting
108:04 - more job opportunities so yeah there's a
108:07 - silver lining to every cloud even a
108:09 - cloud is as black as this one
108:13 - so again i want to thank you very much
108:16 - uh jessica colleen sid
108:19 - everybody scroll down

108:43 - thank you
108:44 - we are going to be talking all about the
108:47 - post coronavirus pandemic uh developer
108:51 - job market essentially uh what
108:54 - you need to do to be able to get a job
108:57 - during this pandemic uh what your
108:59 - prospects are uh how you might want to
109:02 - change your approach
109:04 - and like what your odds are who's
109:06 - actually still hiring what kind of
109:08 - organizations are likely to grow during
109:10 - this period
109:11 - where opportunities are going to come
109:12 - from we're gonna be talking about all
109:14 - those things and more and i am very
109:16 - proud to have gotten three amazing
109:19 - guests who all know quite a bit about
109:21 - this domain um
109:24 - first
109:25 - alien
109:26 - learner
109:28 - she is extremely learned as her last
109:31 - name may suggest
109:32 - she studied at mit and is an engineer
109:35 - and a developer and she also worked as a
109:38 - recruiter
109:40 - and she was
109:41 - unsatisfied with the way
109:43 - uh
109:44 - technical recruiting worked and she
109:47 - founded a company called interviewing.io
109:49 - where you can go and you can get uh
109:51 - interview training and you can work with
109:53 - real people to get uh interviewed and
109:56 - you get a job through there too and
109:57 - maybe she can share some statistics
109:59 - about like the number of people who have
110:00 - gone through later but uh we're we're
110:02 - thrilled to have you with us
110:04 - thank you thank you
110:06 - andrew brown
110:08 - uh from toronto uh
110:10 - and he is a
110:14 - super knowledgeable guy he's worked as a
110:15 - developer for years and years and now he
110:18 - runs exam pro dot co which is a website
110:21 - where you can go to get uh comprehensive
110:23 - aws certification training and he's been
110:26 - working
110:27 - on getting as many people as possible
110:30 - through these certifications so they get
110:32 - certified so they can get the many many
110:34 - cloud engineer jobs that are out there
110:37 - and probably growing as a result of this
110:40 - pandemic um
110:42 - and
110:43 - so andrew brown thank you very much for
110:44 - joining us
110:46 - oh thank you and
110:48 - laurence bradford uh you have probably
110:50 - heard her if you're learning the code uh
110:53 - learn to code with
110:54 - dot me is her website it is an amazing
110:58 - website that she she's got a blog she's
111:00 - written a whole lot actually everybody
111:02 - here i'll just say everybody here on
111:04 - this uh panel has published extensively
111:07 - with free code camp so if they're if
111:09 - they seem familiar that may be one of
111:10 - the reasons why alien learner has
111:11 - written extensively about uh the job
111:13 - market and uh the technical interview
111:16 - process and shared tons of data that
111:18 - she's gotten from her platform andrew
111:20 - has created
111:21 - uh at least three i think four major
111:24 - full-length courses that are on free
111:26 - code camp's youtube channel including an
111:28 - aws for startups
111:30 - and also uh through three different aws
111:33 - certifications and laurence has done
111:36 - so many amazing articles on freecodecamp
111:39 - as well and she has
111:42 - uh
111:43 - one of the longest running programming
111:45 - related podcasts out there it's the
111:47 - learn to code with me podcast so uh if
111:50 - you go into itunes or wherever you
111:51 - listen to podcasts just search learn to
111:53 - code with me and you will find her
111:56 - podcast and she has done 120 episodes
111:59 - she's she's getting ready to head into i
112:01 - think season uh season
112:03 - seven season seven okay
112:06 - yeah so
112:09 - these people are extremely prolific and
112:11 - knowledgeable and i'm super excited to
112:14 - hear their insights about uh the
112:16 - evolving job market so as i started with
112:18 - the other panels i just want to
112:21 - it is strange to be talking about
112:24 - opportunity
112:25 - uh in a time of
112:27 - death and despair and disease
112:30 - and i just want to emphasize
112:33 - that
112:35 - we are aware of all these things
112:38 - we are not physicians we're not
112:40 - front-line workers we're developers
112:43 - we're all doing the best we can
112:46 - we can take as a given that
112:49 - life kind of sucks right now for a whole
112:51 - lot of people
112:53 - and we can be empathetic about that
112:55 - at the same time
112:57 - i'm optimistic that
112:59 - you know 12 18 months from now
113:02 - there will be a widely available
113:03 - vaccination and life will go back to
113:05 - some semblance of what it was before
113:07 - and this is a good time for us to be
113:09 - thinking about that
113:11 - and thinking about what the world might
113:12 - look like coming out of that and also
113:14 - figuring out what we can do
113:16 - today
113:18 - to
113:19 - you know create a positive
113:21 - influence on tomorrow so
113:24 - uh i just want to say that right now it
113:26 - may seem crass that we're talking very
113:29 - uh
113:31 - transactionally very um
113:33 - bluntly about the developer ecosystem
113:35 - and the job market and all those things
113:37 - when people are out there
113:38 - dying and i just want to say that
113:41 - we we do care about that we're aware of
113:43 - those things but we're gonna we're not
113:46 - doctors we're not gonna give you any
113:47 - medical advice or anything like that
113:48 - we're just gonna stay focused on what we
113:50 - know what we know is helping people
113:52 - advance their developer careers
113:54 - so thank you
113:56 - with that note uh i want to go ahead and
113:59 - kick it off and just uh
114:01 - ask aileen
114:03 - how's everything going with you how's
114:05 - everything going with uh the
114:08 - developer job ecosystem in general at a
114:11 - very high level in your in your thinking
114:13 - yeah um things have changed quickly in
114:16 - some ways and they've stayed the same in
114:18 - others so
114:20 - my my whole world is my company and i'm
114:23 - very heads down in that but fortunately
114:25 - what we do is very tied to the subject
114:26 - we're talking about so i'll just share
114:28 - what we've seen and hopefully that's
114:29 - useful um as kind of a microcosm of
114:32 - what's going on everywhere everywhere
114:34 - else in the world so um interviewing io
114:37 - does two things we help people prepare
114:39 - for technical interviews and then if
114:41 - they do well regardless of how they look
114:43 - on paper we actually let them skip a lot
114:46 - of the stuff that happens at the top of
114:48 - the funnel like applying online or
114:49 - talking to recruiters and they can like
114:51 - directly book technical interviews with
114:53 - engineers at companies where they might
114:55 - want to work
114:56 - so
114:57 - what is uh what are the implications of
114:59 - that um on one hand uh we've seen a lot
115:02 - more engagement
115:04 - among our existing users right so i
115:07 - think people are home now more than they
115:09 - used to be which means they don't have
115:11 - to go hide in a conference room to do an
115:13 - interview during the work day so we're
115:15 - seeing people interviewing a lot more
115:17 - which also means there's more
115:18 - competition for potentially a smaller
115:21 - number of jobs i'll get to that in a
115:22 - moment we've also seen and i'll just be
115:24 - transparent about this um a good chunk
115:27 - of our customers freeze hiring
115:30 - and it's sort of it kind of came in this
115:32 - sort of um
115:33 - uh normal distribution like at first it
115:35 - was this trickle right and people are
115:38 - like yeah we're just gonna freeze for a
115:39 - week everything's fine and then you know
115:42 - a few days later no it's we're gonna
115:43 - freeze for like two or three weeks and
115:45 - then more and more customers came in and
115:46 - started freezing um those tended to be
115:50 - if we were to put a category there
115:52 - companies that are probably series a and
115:54 - um earlier
115:56 - so those companies i think are the ones
115:58 - that tend to have
116:00 - the most uncertainty and the most
116:02 - instability um and in some cases less
116:04 - runway so of course uh makes sense that
116:06 - they're being conservative
116:09 - um some of our larger customers
116:11 - we've seen pick up on hiring
116:14 - i think in part it's a response to the
116:17 - increased inbound applications that
116:19 - they're getting and in part i think it's
116:21 - because
116:23 - unless they're very very stable right
116:25 - let's say you're a series b series c
116:28 - type company right you're probably going
116:29 - to start seeing a little more attrition
116:31 - right now because some portion of your
116:33 - engineers are going to proactively go to
116:37 - the most stable jobs of all which is
116:39 - probably fang right facebook um apple
116:41 - amazon netflix google and microsoft
116:44 - potentially um so uh we have seen a
116:46 - shift to to more people applying there
116:48 - but we have seen a pickup in hiring
116:51 - especially among um these sort of larger
116:53 - companies that are doing things that are
116:56 - in some way related to solving the
116:58 - problems the world is facing right now
117:00 - maybe it's remote communication right
117:03 - maybe it's healthcare and healthcare is
117:05 - a very big umbrella that covers a lot of
117:07 - different things but in general we've
117:09 - seen that that space pick up um
117:12 - maybe it's logistics right uh maybe it's
117:15 - delivery of food uh so there have been
117:17 - these sort of spikes and then there's
117:20 - been a lot of drops and i think net if
117:22 - we were to average out the whole thing
117:24 - there's definitely been a slowdown in
117:26 - hiring um but it doesn't we were
117:29 - expecting to see maybe you know half or
117:32 - more of our customers freeze and that
117:34 - absolutely has not happened and our
117:36 - overall interview volume like how it's
117:38 - what it's constituted of has shifted but
117:41 - it actually hasn't dropped very much
117:44 - okay great
117:45 - so just to be clear like
117:47 - the number of opportunities may have
117:49 - decreased but it's not nearly as big of
117:51 - a decrease as you might think yep and
117:54 - who knows i mean
117:55 - i don't know i basically stopped trying
117:57 - to predict the future right uh things
117:59 - change so quickly like in a matter of
118:01 - days and our strategy has changed like
118:03 - three times internally now so it's a
118:05 - hard time for us but um
118:07 - so far it's less bad than i think
118:09 - anybody internally thought it would be
118:12 - okay awesome and uh alien if you could
118:14 - just kind of hold your mic slightly off
118:16 - your shirt it's just it's pushing your
118:17 - mic which is creating a little bit of
118:18 - clicking so exactly yeah no worries i
118:20 - didn't want to like
118:22 - ruin your flow or anything yeah just
118:24 - when you're talking and you can just
118:26 - mute when you're not talking so you
118:27 - don't have to worry about it but that's
118:28 - like a frequent thing i'm sure laurence
118:30 - has encountered that when she's doing
118:31 - podcasts like the itu the apple
118:33 - headphones always had the mic rub
118:35 - against the shirt collar i get very
118:36 - animated
118:38 - also like if you have jewelry on i do
118:40 - this like sometimes it can bang against
118:42 - the table and i realize that i'm like oh
118:44 - i'm probably so loud like right near the
118:46 - microphone but yeah
118:49 - yeah well laurence uh so
118:51 - you're experiencing this from a from a
118:53 - different perspective you have tons of
118:54 - friends who are applying for jobs uh
118:56 - what has your experience been like
118:58 - anecdotally
119:00 - yeah so my experience is really
119:02 - different because i'm not um working
119:04 - with directly people who are applying to
119:06 - different companies i'm not
119:08 - working with companies who are
119:09 - interviewing candidates but i've been
119:11 - hearing from friends and also just my
119:14 - own research
119:15 - honestly the last few weeks i don't i
119:17 - don't know why but i've been very into
119:19 - following who's hiring who's laying off
119:23 - um like these shifts and where like
119:25 - people are spending money the new york
119:26 - times actually published a really
119:28 - interesting graphic yesterday that
119:30 - showed it was like this really this bar
119:32 - chart that showed where people are
119:34 - spending less concerts uh restaurants a
119:38 - few other things that just like aren't
119:39 - really a reality right now when we can't
119:41 - go outside and be in groups but then it
119:44 - showed this like spike in spending in
119:46 - other areas like delivery services
119:48 - groceries i mean i know personally as a
119:50 - household we spent twice as much last
119:52 - month on groceries like going to the
119:54 - grocery store buying food or delivery
119:56 - stuff than we did the month prior
119:59 - and
120:00 - i'm so yeah i've just been fascinated
120:01 - with this shift and like where we're
120:02 - spending money how we're spending money
120:04 - the company's laying off the companies
120:05 - who are hiring more now
120:07 - and as you said quincy i've had friends
120:09 - who have been laid off or on the other
120:12 - hand friends that are completely
120:14 - overwhelmed and really stressed out with
120:16 - work right now because
120:18 - they're having the most work that
120:19 - they've ever had in their life and
120:21 - specifically the two friends i'm
120:22 - thinking of work in like shipping
120:24 - logistics e-commerce
120:27 - uh my
120:28 - my like childhood best friend growing up
120:30 - she
120:31 - she doesn't work in tech but she works
120:33 - in like shipping logistics for dhl which
120:35 - is a really big like shipping company
120:36 - and she has huge clients all around the
120:38 - globe and she's like
120:40 - this has been the craziest week i've
120:42 - worked here for five years and this the
120:44 - craziest few weeks has been absolutely
120:45 - insane but turning the conversation like
120:48 - back towards technology
120:50 - i've been really following a lot of the
120:52 - news again of the companies that are
120:54 - laying people off which there are a lot
120:55 - i feel like if you look at the headlines
120:57 - or you turn on cnn or what have you
120:59 - another company is laying people off and
121:01 - other companies laying people off but
121:02 - then on the flip side there are a lot of
121:04 - companies that are increasing hiring
121:06 - another friend of mine who used to work
121:08 - at a cannabis startup of sorts i don't
121:11 - know exactly what they did but i know
121:14 - she got laid off and i know she very
121:16 - quickly got an interview
121:18 - at a
121:19 - life insurance company because it's not
121:22 - really shocking but life insurance sales
121:24 - i think they've doubled or something
121:26 - since all the coronavirus stuff has been
121:27 - happening so there are these industries
121:29 - that maybe isn't talked about as much
121:31 - that are seeing an increase in demand
121:33 - because of all this um and as you said
121:36 - in the beginning quincy like
121:38 - it is really unfortunate that so many
121:39 - companies are going under or laying
121:41 - people off and then there are like these
121:43 - winners and losers but it just is
121:46 - i don't know the way it is right now
121:49 - yeah and andrew what's your experience
121:51 - you're you're coming to us from uh
121:54 - north of the border uh yeah
121:56 - yeah i can give you the canadian
121:58 - experience and i do know a little bit
122:00 - that's going on uh to our our friends to
122:02 - the south um and i would i would agree
122:04 - with laurence um there are industries
122:06 - that are definitely taking off and ones
122:08 - that aren't i can specifically say like
122:09 - if you're looking at edtech med tech or
122:12 - stream tech uh those ones we're seeing
122:14 - uh
122:15 - that they're uh that they're thriving
122:18 - because they're going virtual or you
122:20 - know it's direct to the pandemic or the
122:22 - fact that everybody has to uh now uh
122:24 - work virtually um other industries that
122:27 - uh the technical demand is growing i
122:28 - wouldn't say they're thriving but the
122:29 - the demand is there is insure tax so
122:32 - lauren's just mentioned that that's a
122:33 - really good uh point and delivery tech
122:35 - that's another one right how to get
122:36 - stuff to people or logistics uh so you
122:39 - know if you are looking for a job uh you
122:41 - know consider looking at those
122:43 - industries and trying to
122:44 - tailor tailor your resume or tailor your
122:47 - skills for these industries in the short
122:48 - term
122:49 - because i think that's going to help you
122:51 - um to talk specifically about the roles
122:54 - that we're seeing that people are
122:56 - getting laid off for
122:57 - for those who don't know like um you
122:59 - know i wasn't just a developer i was a
123:00 - cto um for multiple startups prior and
123:03 - so i'm very fortunate to be part of a
123:05 - network of ctos in canada and so when
123:08 - people say that um that companies are
123:10 - laying them off i literally see the ctos
123:12 - and the slack group saying i had to lay
123:13 - off these people
123:15 - and then what they're doing is they are
123:17 - trying to
123:18 - mitigate that by helping um uh or
123:21 - finding other companies to help hire
123:23 - these people back okay
123:25 - um but to talk specifically about the
123:27 - actual rules where i'm seeing um uh that
123:30 - are being de-prioritized and the ones
123:31 - that are now scaling up on i actually
123:34 - made a little list here so there's
123:36 - there's uh what i've been seeing for
123:37 - people getting let go for is sales and
123:39 - business development digital marketing
123:42 - ux and web design uh in some cases uh uh
123:45 - uh data analysis uh and and that's why i
123:48 - like to think of it as that there's
123:49 - growth aesthetics and
123:50 - and
123:51 - analysis which are being cut down on
123:53 - because that's really when you're
123:54 - focusing on the growth of your business
123:56 - and right now people are being more
123:57 - conservative and so they're looking uh
123:59 - more for security reliability and
124:01 - support and for those kind of roles
124:03 - we're seeing a huge increase in a
124:05 - general technologist if we're talking
124:07 - about from the cloud perspective that's
124:08 - called a solution architect uh project
124:11 - management's very important uh cloud
124:13 - engineer so that's a hybrid between web
124:14 - developer and cloud skills virtual
124:16 - assistants i even have to get a virtual
124:18 - assistant because the increase in this
124:20 - um this market has been uh crazy social
124:24 - media support so we might have seen a
124:26 - decrease in people doing sales and
124:27 - marketing but we're seeing an increase
124:29 - in support uh for uh existing users uh
124:32 - and that stuff like that data engineers
124:34 - so we saw a drop with um uh data
124:36 - analysis but we're seeing now data
124:37 - engineers will become more popular site
124:39 - reliability officer that's someone that
124:41 - can make sure that the platform is
124:43 - running uh stable and security engineers
124:46 - so you know listen to that uh that list
124:49 - i gave you i might share it uh later on
124:51 - into the free code camp discord as a as
124:53 - a conversation after after there if you
124:55 - want to know a little bit more about
124:56 - those roles but that is my take on it
124:58 - and that's me looking at these lists
125:00 - that are coming in who's getting laid
125:01 - off and that stuff and by the way uh
125:04 - these lists are actually public um i
125:06 - just don't feel like they're publicized
125:07 - very well and so i was able to grab
125:09 - those links and i have a list of lists
125:11 - of places that are are are hiring and a
125:14 - list of lists that are layoffs you can
125:16 - go through there and you can see what's
125:18 - being hired for and what's not and
125:19 - there's another list of of of people
125:22 - that are getting uh that are looking for
125:24 - work right it's called the helpless dot
125:26 - ca um and i i think there's other
125:28 - countries doing it i just know i just
125:30 - know the canadian space um uh but but
125:32 - you look at those lists and and you can
125:34 - even get a feel of you know how you can
125:36 - align to that market to get a job uh so
125:39 - you know there i think that's a a bit
125:41 - for now so
125:43 - i'll tell you yeah i mean that in the
125:44 - background
125:45 - fantastic and it sounds like you have
125:47 - the making of like a big you know like a
125:50 - major article like or maybe even a
125:52 - regular article like hey
125:54 - here like this this week's update uh
125:56 - during the uh
125:58 - uh pandemic pandemic job
126:00 - status
126:01 - anyway
126:02 - any way i could help i'd love to write
126:03 - an article it's just it's people just
126:05 - have to ask me right so yeah right yeah
126:07 - well
126:08 - consider this a request for another
126:09 - there you go then you get and you'll get
126:11 - an article and and laurence i know
126:13 - you've also been trying to assemble as
126:16 - much information as you can
126:17 - and get it out there in the hands of
126:19 - people as far as like uh i mean we could
126:21 - we could absolutely run like some sort
126:23 - of survey or something i should actually
126:25 - put together a survey for
126:27 - this conference sorry i didn't think
126:29 - about that until now uh
126:31 - but i will i'll get that together and
126:32 - i'll shoot that link out through twitter
126:34 - so just
126:35 - follow the lockdown conf hashtag and
126:37 - look for a post conference survey a lot
126:39 - of people are watching live right now
126:41 - we're getting some questions i'll go to
126:42 - those in a moment thank you everybody
126:44 - for asking your questions please just
126:46 - pile all your questions in there
126:48 - we've got experts for the next uh 30
126:51 - minutes or so and we want to get as many
126:53 - other questions to them as as we can
126:56 - and then a huge number of people
126:58 - probably like ninety percent of the
126:59 - people who are going to watch this are
127:00 - gonna watch this after the stream ends
127:02 - and just watch the uh
127:04 - you know the the edited version where
127:06 - we're gonna edit out the breaks and
127:07 - everything but um so
127:11 - uh i have a very very quick
127:14 - um
127:16 - question that i think uh
127:19 - i want to ask
127:20 - to my co-emcee um
127:24 - how are things going in bangalore and
127:26 - what's the indian experience like
127:27 - because india is a massive country with
127:30 - tons of tech companies and
127:31 - i just heard that the uh lockdown was
127:33 - further extended today yeah yeah yeah
127:36 - the lockdown has been extended uh yeah
127:38 - the lockdown has been extended till may
127:40 - 3rd
127:41 - we just got the news from the prime
127:43 - minister this morning and uh
127:46 - the companies are taking it slow here
127:49 - from what i have heard
127:51 - most of the companies
127:54 - like food delivery companies and
127:57 - hyper local markets and all those
127:59 - companies have reduced the number of
128:01 - hiring here at the
128:03 - in the current time and most of the
128:07 - hiring that are going on as andrew said
128:10 - are on the non-technical uh
128:13 - jobs right now so
128:16 - so yeah um
128:18 - it's it hasn't impacted um like some
128:22 - anything different from the rest of the
128:23 - world
128:25 - okay great and uh
128:28 - this question comes from the audience uh
128:30 - from elliot sanford who as i mentioned
128:32 - earlier we had a question from him uh he
128:35 - is a boot camp student and he's getting
128:37 - ready to graduate it's kind of like the
128:39 - university graduate
128:41 - in 2008 right like coming out to a
128:43 - fairly tepid job market a relatively
128:46 - tepid market
128:48 - coming out of a coding bootcamp in 2020
128:51 - uh
128:52 - what would be
128:54 - uh his question is how should i as a
128:56 - boot camper near graduation combat
128:58 - negativity and what things
129:00 - can i do to compete against the more
129:03 - experienced developers in the hiring
129:04 - pool
129:07 - oh i'll start
129:08 - great
129:09 - yeah um so there are two things that
129:12 - make coming out of a boot camp really
129:14 - hard and i think these things were
129:17 - always hard even in a great market and
129:19 - they're going to be extra hard now so
129:22 - the first thing is even getting your
129:24 - foot in the door so as you probably know
129:26 - there is a somewhat potentially unfair
129:28 - bias against boot camp grads um and what
129:32 - makes it even harder now
129:34 - is that one of the other groups that we
129:35 - haven't talked about who's experiencing
129:37 - heavy layoffs is recruiters
129:40 - so recruiters are getting laid off like
129:42 - crazy which means that a company that
129:44 - previously potentially had a whole team
129:46 - dealing with junior hiring might now
129:48 - have just a handful of people that are
129:50 - scattered between sales recruiting ops
129:53 - recruiting um and engineering recruiting
129:56 - and some of them might not be domain
129:57 - experts in those fields because they're
129:59 - just being grabbed and that's what
130:01 - they're doing now
130:02 - um so
130:04 - it's even more important now than it
130:06 - ever was before to find a way to
130:09 - get noticed and stand out and if you
130:12 - apply online and i've said this before
130:14 - about applying online even in the best
130:16 - situations it's kind of like screaming
130:17 - into a black hole like the abyss will
130:20 - probably not answer you uh so
130:22 - if you can um just bypass recruiting
130:25 - entirely find an engineer that works at
130:28 - that company find somebody even if you
130:29 - don't know them maybe they wrote a blog
130:31 - post about something you're interested
130:32 - in just get on hacker news get on the
130:34 - company blog get on linkedin make a list
130:37 - of engineers that work there that you
130:39 - have something smart you can say to or
130:41 - something that you uh can talk about a
130:43 - shared interest you know maybe maybe you
130:45 - know somebody in common and just treat
130:47 - it like a sales job so pretend you're a
130:50 - sales development representative and you
130:52 - have a funnel
130:53 - and it's your job to just reach out to
130:56 - engineers at a bunch of companies that
130:58 - you want to work and to each one say
131:00 - something that doesn't just say hey i
131:02 - graduated from a bootcamp and i'm
131:03 - looking for a job talk about something
131:05 - they've done you're interested in talk
131:06 - about something you've done that is
131:08 - related to the subject matter and you're
131:10 - going to get a lot of you're not even
131:12 - going to get rejections most people will
131:13 - just ignore you but this will probably
131:15 - improve your odds of getting noticed by
131:17 - an order of magnitude
131:19 - if not more so that's the first thing
131:22 - the second thing that makes graduating
131:24 - from a boot camp really hard
131:26 - is being prepared for technical
131:28 - interviews
131:29 - now different companies interview
131:31 - differently not everybody does full-on
131:33 - algorithmic interviews but depending on
131:35 - where you're applying
131:36 - chances are they do and you can probably
131:38 - find out one of my personal biggest pet
131:42 - peeves with i think every boot camp
131:44 - under the sun is that they do not do an
131:46 - adequate job of preparing you for this
131:48 - and they also de-emphasize how important
131:50 - it is
131:51 - so i would get on starting your funnel
131:53 - doing all your outreach to everybody to
131:56 - get your foot in the door and in
131:58 - parallel
131:59 - i would start
132:00 - heavily preparing for technical
132:03 - interviews code camp has a free code
132:05 - camp has a lot of resources of course my
132:07 - company does this so we'll encourage you
132:09 - to go to interviewing i o but there are
132:11 - books there there are a ton of resources
132:13 - out there um and i would spend
132:16 - weeks if not months and i'm sorry this
132:19 - this is going to sound discouraging but
132:20 - weeks if not months working algorithmic
132:23 - problems
132:24 - uh understanding data structures and
132:26 - filling in those gaps that your boot
132:29 - camp probably left in your education
132:31 - it's going to be hard but if you kind of
132:33 - embrace the idea that it's going to be
132:35 - hard and make peace with it
132:36 - you'll be successful just sort of say
132:39 - it's going to take three months for me
132:40 - to find a job maybe more i'm okay with
132:42 - it and in the meantime i'm gonna go
132:44 - heads down and focus on these two things
132:49 - cool
132:50 - awesome advice and i'm actually typing
132:52 - up verbatim a quote you just said aileen
132:54 - uh so uh andrew did you want to talk
132:57 - about this a little bit too oh yeah
132:59 - i would love to talk about it so it uh
133:01 - so for those who don't know i'm in the
133:03 - uh the greater toronto area and i
133:05 - actually do a lot of mentorship with
133:06 - boot camp grads from a variety of
133:08 - different ones here so we have general
133:10 - assembly
133:11 - lighthouse labs uh we cloud data
133:14 - and juno and so there is a bit of a
133:17 - difficulty getting the job at the tail
133:18 - end there um the career services for
133:20 - every boot camp is different some are
133:22 - some give you a lot of support
133:23 - afterwards um some uh put on you to to
133:27 - do that effort but i can give you a
133:28 - couple of hacks of what you could do to
133:30 - try to get a job in the market um and so
133:33 - there's there's two ways we can we can
133:34 - take the friendly way or we can do the
133:35 - cold call way and so let's talk about
133:37 - the cold call way um and this is my
133:39 - approach and i could do this today and
133:41 - get a job uh in a week and so so this is
133:44 - what i would do i would go to angel list
133:46 - uh camera if it's dot say or whatever
133:48 - the or dot io i feel like it's a dot io
133:50 - but if you look up angel list it has all
133:52 - the startups uh in the world uh per
133:55 - country so i would say okay what's my
133:57 - closest uh tech hub it's toronto or
134:00 - what's in my time zone as long as it's
134:02 - my time zone or near me that's great i'm
134:04 - going to sort by the greenest greenest
134:06 - meaning the newest startups on the
134:08 - market i'm going to go down the list i'm
134:09 - going to try to guess who
134:11 - is near raising money to get uh their
134:14 - their their it depends on what kind of
134:16 - risk you want to take but if you're if
134:18 - they're close to getting their seed or
134:19 - their series a i'm going to find those
134:21 - green companies i'm going to look at
134:22 - them and say um what do they do and what
134:26 - impact can i make on their company and
134:29 - then what i'm going to do is i'm going
134:30 - to reach out with them and i'm actually
134:31 - going to build them something and i'm
134:33 - just going to ship it to them because if
134:35 - you show up and hand with some something
134:37 - it's very hard for people to say no if
134:38 - you can guess what it is that's going to
134:40 - really help them uh it's it's very
134:42 - unlikely they will will turn you away
134:44 - but i think it's a better method than
134:46 - applying to 30 40 places if you uh it's
134:49 - better to build 10 apps that are for
134:51 - very specific industries and then you
134:53 - get to keep those apps and also um you
134:55 - get faster and faster building
134:57 - applications so you say if you think it
134:58 - takes a lot a lot of time that is the
135:00 - number one thing i find boot camp grads
135:02 - coming out of their curriculum is that
135:04 - they do not have the the technical speed
135:07 - um so they might have the skill but they
135:08 - don't have the speed and so you should
135:10 - be able to build out uh small
135:12 - applications whether it's five or ten in
135:15 - a week and ship those things out and
135:16 - you'll get a much greater response
135:19 - and the thing is people are always
135:20 - worried about giving those away for free
135:22 - the reason i'm not worried about doing
135:23 - it is that if somebody wants to utilize
135:26 - it they need the person that built it to
135:28 - maintain it and you have them on the
135:29 - hook so they're going to want to
135:32 - bring you in the door for that you've
135:34 - really thought about what the problem is
135:35 - for the business owner and a lot of
135:37 - startups just do not post their jobs
135:39 - online because they do not have time or
135:41 - uh there's such a small team it's just
135:43 - like they feel like they're wasting
135:44 - their time so they're gonna wait till
135:45 - they get to a certain growth before they
135:46 - post that stuff out and by taking that
135:48 - initiative that is a great way to get
135:51 - your foot in the door and also to get a
135:53 - role that you normally wouldn't be able
135:54 - to get and then quickly move up the
135:56 - ladder okay so that is the cold call way
135:59 - the other way is the friendly way and i
136:00 - find this works for
136:01 - medium to large companies
136:03 - and uh the idea is that you want to
136:05 - become friends with whoever it is uh
136:09 - that works for that company so if you
136:10 - want to work at aws you better go on
136:12 - linkedin you better add everybody you
136:13 - know that works at aws
136:16 - um and and be authentic and and try to
136:18 - be as helpful as you can and document
136:20 - your journey that is parallel to this
136:22 - company and uh you know hopefully what
136:24 - they'll do is they'll take notice of uh
136:26 - of it they'll like your stuff i never
136:28 - tell people to go message people
136:30 - directly on linkedin i say go add
136:31 - somebody
136:32 - you don't have to message them and then
136:34 - just if they'll see if you're active
136:36 - they'll see you in their stream if
136:37 - they're interacting with you that means
136:39 - they're aware of your content and then
136:41 - you can go reach out or you can go on
136:43 - linkedin say boy i wish i had a job like
136:45 - this and those people who have already
136:46 - seen it and then they'll reach out to
136:48 - you um and and that's the friendly
136:50 - canadian way to get a job i don't know
136:52 - if it works everywhere but it definitely
136:53 - works really well here
136:55 - so those are my two hacks for you
136:58 - one thing i'll quickly add if that's
136:59 - okay
137:00 - i strongly advise not messaging
137:03 - engineers on linkedin or adding them on
137:05 - linkedin because they're not they they
137:07 - hate it because all they ever get there
137:08 - is recruiter spam right so
137:11 - sorry so i would say that in context it
137:13 - depends what it is so if you want to add
137:15 - engineers just add them if your profile
137:17 - looks and by the way i have an article i
137:19 - think called linkedin for losers i don't
137:21 - know why i named it that but because
137:22 - it's like ll
137:24 - but i i agree with you i think you're
137:25 - right i get so much spam it drives me
137:27 - crazy but if you just add somebody what
137:30 - they're going to do is they're going to
137:31 - look at your linkedin profile they're
137:32 - going to say what is this person's
137:34 - motivation what why do they want to
137:35 - connect with with me and if you look
137:38 - like that you just you're interested in
137:40 - the same space and you're going to share
137:42 - cool content and you're not going to be
137:43 - like like spamming that person trying to
137:46 - get a job then they're going to add you
137:48 - and then down the road when you build up
137:49 - that friendship then you can message
137:51 - them or or do that subtle thing saying
137:53 - oh boy i wish i could work here yeah um
137:56 - i guess both approaches can work i in my
137:58 - experience i found that just figuring
138:00 - out somebody's email address and writing
138:02 - them a highly personalized email that
138:04 - touches on something they've done before
138:06 - and something you're interested in is
138:08 - much more effective but i uh i have not
138:10 - tried uh sort of the add me and then i'm
138:13 - gonna post interesting well i'll tell
138:14 - you i'll tell you the other day i got an
138:15 - email from somebody and and they sent me
138:17 - a really long email and it was great but
138:20 - uh it was so long and especially like
138:22 - when you're uh like a developer you're
138:24 - busy you don't have time to read long
138:26 - emails your brain just turns off so if
138:27 - you do want to take that approach make
138:29 - sure it's concise but the only reason i
138:31 - stuck with that email was because the
138:33 - person who sent me the email their
138:34 - profile was was star trek themed so they
138:37 - said so that is a big long thing and i'm
138:39 - going to read this going oh man they're
138:41 - just trying to they're just trying to
138:42 - like uh uh
138:43 - game me you know like trying to trying
138:45 - to uh build that relationship really
138:47 - fast um but that they had that that uh
138:50 - personal biased uh and that that got
138:52 - them a personal response back for me i
138:54 - wouldn't say uh that always works every
138:57 - single time but it just that time it
138:58 - worked so yeah personalization is key
139:01 - i've gotten so many emails where people
139:02 - just rehash everything they've ever done
139:04 - and it just reads like a generic cover
139:06 - letter i get dozens of those a day and i
139:08 - tend to ignore them
139:10 - i would say oh sorry about that i would
139:12 - say um i would say that it's not just
139:15 - being personable it's being authentic
139:17 - and i think as humans we can tell when
139:19 - something is off so so even if you think
139:22 - you're being personable it's like we
139:23 - know you're up to something right so
139:25 - personal so something that touches on
139:27 - something you've done something i've
139:28 - done something that
139:30 - not just friendly but something that
139:31 - that draws on a shared interest or or
139:33 - something useful that isn't just
139:35 - networking i think we're saying the same
139:36 - thing oh you don't know for certainly
139:38 - i'm just i'm just trying to to iterate
139:40 - that uh being personable is not the same
139:42 - thing as being authentic totally and i
139:45 - think that you know you can be
139:46 - personable but we're like okay great but
139:47 - we see that there's an agenda behind it
139:50 - um you know and i get just to interrupt
139:52 - like i get a lot of emails
139:54 - uh and a lot of them address me as sir
139:56 - like sir
139:57 - and i immediately know okay this
139:58 - person's probably asking for something
140:00 - if they're calling me sir right off the
140:02 - bat if that's how they address me uh and
140:04 - also
140:05 - if i get an email from you and it's in a
140:08 - like a non-plain text font
140:10 - i'm just gonna automatically archive it
140:11 - like i won't read it because
140:14 - the quality of the emails that i get
140:17 - that are not in like just the standard
140:18 - text that have some sort of formatting
140:20 - on them
140:21 - is always very low uh so it's just like
140:23 - pattern recognition don't use funky
140:25 - fonts don't use like a lengthy signature
140:28 - um those kinds of things are tells that
140:30 - uh you're not human
140:32 - yeah
140:33 - okay i had one thing oh real quick about
140:36 - that for the boot camp grad so i think
140:39 - both of your answers were fantastic and
140:42 - i always tell people like it's never too
140:44 - early to start practicing for a
140:45 - technical interview like yeah months in
140:47 - advance like even if you're not even
140:48 - thinking about getting a tech job yet um
140:51 - pandemic or not like start practicing
140:53 - for those technical interview questions
140:55 - for sure super important that can like
140:57 - literally make or break your opportunity
140:59 - of getting a tech job and competing with
141:01 - other people who do have computer
141:03 - science degrees however if you're a
141:05 - coding bootcamp graduate or soon to be
141:07 - or someone else looking to get a job in
141:08 - tech
141:09 - and you're feeling a lot of pressure
141:11 - because it's like wow i'm going into
141:14 - the job market in like the worst
141:15 - possible time like literally when was
141:17 - the last time you had a major pandemic
141:19 - like this affecting our lives like
141:21 - i don't know like
141:23 - like what this uh in 1918 or something
141:25 - so years ago yeah so yeah so like give
141:28 - yourself some grace like
141:30 - like realize that these are crazy
141:32 - unforeseen circumstances and if you're
141:35 - in a situation where you need a job to
141:37 - support yourself or your family it is
141:40 - completely okay to have a temporary job
141:43 - plan even if you did just go to this
141:44 - coding bootcamp even if you did just
141:46 - graduate
141:47 - from a degree with or a school with
141:49 - computer science degree
141:51 - uh of course go after those positions
141:53 - but do something else in the meantime to
141:55 - make ends meet and there are companies
141:57 - like i know instacart is doubling their
142:00 - customer support um
142:02 - staff by the end of may so i think they
142:04 - have 1200 now and they're going to be
142:07 - uh going up to three thousand like
142:09 - but yeah by the end of may so like six
142:11 - weeks or something maybe a customer
142:13 - support role at instacart isn't your
142:15 - dream job but nonetheless i think it
142:17 - could even be a step in the right
142:19 - direction depending on what industry
142:20 - you're coming into because instacart is
142:22 - still a tech company
142:24 - maybe you you know again maybe it's not
142:26 - exactly what you want but it could be a
142:27 - step there you could get your foot in
142:29 - the door at that company or maybe you
142:31 - could leverage that experience in the
142:33 - future to get a job at another delivery
142:36 - company of sorts but as a junior
142:38 - developer so give yourself some grace
142:40 - this is a really hard time right now and
142:42 - like
142:43 - just
142:44 - take that in as you you know go about
142:45 - your job search
142:47 - i would like to bring to this
142:49 - something to the focus here like what
142:52 - advice do you have for developers who
142:54 - are planning to uh land a job uh in
142:57 - companies like facebook and google
142:58 - because today morning uh
143:00 - cheryl from facebook announced that they
143:02 - are going to hire 10 000 people in
143:04 - engineering and product by the end of
143:06 - the year so what advice do you have for
143:08 - developers to
143:10 - apply for these companies and also crack
143:12 - those jobs
143:16 - for oh i i actually i'm not sure if i
143:18 - would be the best to answer this because
143:19 - a lot of my experience is like at
143:21 - startups and whatnot but i did see this
143:23 - statistic you're talking about as far as
143:25 - um facebook playing to hire 10 000 more
143:28 - developers which is like literally five
143:30 - times the size of my college that's like
143:32 - a town
143:33 - of how many developers that they're
143:34 - hiring i know they have a lot of
143:35 - employees though but i feel like eileen
143:37 - maybe you'd be better at answering that
143:39 - and like approaching um a big tech
143:41 - company like that yeah i mean my uh my
143:44 - advice is not going to be that different
143:45 - for those companies than than for other
143:47 - groups again um
143:49 - right now those companies are getting
143:50 - hit really really hard because everybody
143:53 - views them as a stable place to work
143:55 - right so
143:56 - uh they are some of the only ones that
143:58 - are advertising loudly that they're
144:00 - hiring during this time they also pay
144:02 - more so even even in an easy easy
144:04 - economy it's hard to get noticed and
144:06 - here it's going to be even harder so um
144:10 - if you can try to get a referral in try
144:13 - to um chances are a lot of them
144:16 - one thing that people don't know about
144:17 - recruiters at these companies is that
144:19 - most recruiters are contractors and i'll
144:21 - explain why i'm talking about this in a
144:23 - moment so
144:24 - um
144:25 - what can happen sometimes is you get
144:27 - reached out to by a recruiter if you're
144:29 - fortunate enough for that to happen and
144:31 - then by the time you see it maybe you
144:32 - missed it you reach back out to them and
144:34 - they're no longer there these people are
144:36 - usually contractors that work at these
144:38 - companies for six months stints and then
144:41 - they move on to the next place um
144:44 - so again i would try to forge a genuine
144:47 - authentic
144:48 - relationship with an engineer at one of
144:51 - these companies maybe an engineering
144:52 - manager maybe think about which teams
144:56 - might be hiring more than others you'll
144:58 - still have to go through that like
144:59 - centralized interview process but at
145:01 - least you'll have somebody um
145:03 - put your hat into the ring
145:05 - um so that's that's one i know that's
145:07 - not super useful advice the fact is like
145:09 - it's really
145:10 - really hard and it's gonna get even
145:12 - harder but if you are fortunate enough
145:14 - to get in and this is um extra important
145:17 - interviews at these companies are very
145:19 - very difficult and they tend to follow a
145:22 - very very specific pattern and you
145:25 - really only get one shot one one piece
145:27 - of data that we've seen on our platform
145:29 - over and over is that the same engineer
145:31 - can do very very well in a technical
145:34 - interview one day and then the next day
145:36 - absolutely bomb even if those interviews
145:39 - are of comparable difficulty with
145:40 - engineers who are comparably strict it's
145:43 - because the interview process is just
145:45 - fundamentally non-deterministic and
145:47 - there's just so much room for error the
145:49 - best thing you can do once you get your
145:51 - foot in the door is to spend even longer
145:54 - than i advise before preparing for
145:56 - interviews so that when you do get your
145:58 - opportunity
146:00 - you don't screw it up here's another
146:01 - thing that i've seen a lot of people do
146:03 - wrong
146:04 - sometimes somebody is so happy that they
146:07 - finally hear from one of these big
146:08 - companies that the recruiter who's
146:10 - incent i mean recruiters are
146:11 - incentivized to make hires as quickly as
146:13 - possible because they're compensated on
146:15 - it and they're they're uh generally uh
146:18 - that's like their um their bar for
146:21 - performance
146:22 - that doesn't mean that you have to
146:23 - interview immediately if facebook
146:25 - reaches out to you they get back to you
146:26 - and they say okay great get on the phone
146:28 - with a facebook engineer next week
146:31 - if you're not ready
146:32 - just push it out and they're gonna be
146:34 - okay with it don't panic don't say okay
146:36 - this is my only chance i'm just gonna
146:38 - cram the night before it's gonna if
146:40 - you've never done these kinds of
146:41 - interviews it will take you months
146:44 - so accept that push your interview off
146:46 - schedule it a few months out and then
146:48 - spend hours a day preparing
146:52 - so i might be able to touch a bit on the
146:53 - like fang or large companies there so um
146:56 - one of my friends he wanted to uh work
146:59 - at google well i don't know if he wanted
147:00 - to work at google but what he did was uh
147:02 - he was reached out from uh uh from
147:05 - recruiters uh within google and he went
147:08 - all the way he went all the way and they
147:10 - offered them the job and then he said no
147:12 - so he didn't really want the job he
147:15 - loved the challenge and now he he makes
147:17 - video games he lives on an island uh and
147:19 - but the thing the thing about that is
147:21 - that he's they said okay well who should
147:23 - we uh who should we hire since you're so
147:25 - great who can you recommend and then
147:27 - they reached out to me and so i was
147:28 - going through the process and then i did
147:29 - the same thing i went yeah you know what
147:31 - i'm having fun doing this but really i'm
147:32 - not going to see to the end so i'm going
147:34 - to stop here and they went to me and
147:36 - said who can you recommend so um you
147:38 - know if you if if you know any friends
147:40 - who've gone through the process um or or
147:43 - make friends with other people that are
147:44 - going through it because maybe they can
147:46 - pass you along and and the process is
147:48 - very uh uh
147:50 - uh random so like i was going really uh
147:52 - really well through google i cannot get
147:54 - hired at aws to save my life and it
147:56 - makes no sense because everybody around
147:58 - me you'll be able to work at says you
148:00 - are qualified um the process is crazy
148:03 - i've had like senior senior develop
148:05 - developer advocates reach out to me and
148:07 - say to me you know i had to apply five
148:10 - times to work to work here before i got
148:12 - in so you just have to take your bumps
148:15 - and realize that it's going to be
148:17 - a very difficult process
148:19 - i can say that you know for any of these
148:20 - companies assist well depends for the
148:22 - job but
148:23 - systems design is a very important thing
148:25 - so understanding how to build a complex
148:27 - systems so
148:28 - or looking for a systems design engineer
148:31 - if you google those terms
148:33 - those might help you understand
148:35 - conceptually how to put things together
148:36 - and obviously there's algorithmic
148:38 - challenges interview preparation if you
148:40 - could find any good services for that
148:42 - that would be great too um you know so
148:44 - that's just my two cents on uh on that
148:46 - part uh just one more thing to add there
148:48 - um if you are from india and you're
148:50 - coming to canada last year we started
148:52 - fast tracking visas to india because we
148:55 - really want more talent here um so so
148:58 - there's a lot of opportunities uh there
149:00 - as well
149:01 - if you want to work at a big company but
149:03 - not necessarily one of the fan companies
149:05 - uh there's good recruiters like uh
149:07 - vanhack i always hear really good things
149:09 - about them and you might think that
149:10 - right now there's no opportunities
149:12 - because there's no way to uh there's no
149:14 - way to bring people actually into canada
149:17 - but what what's happening is that these
149:19 - companies are hiring the remote and
149:20 - they're waiting for everything to blow
149:21 - over and then they bring them into
149:23 - canada so we're not seeing a drop uh
149:26 - drop in there uh if uh if you want to
149:28 - get into cloud jefferson frank is a
149:30 - really really good recruiter
149:31 - if you want to get in into
149:33 - data science roles or anything data in
149:35 - canada we career is really really good
149:36 - they're not a recruiter but they they
149:38 - know a lot of companies uh that can get
149:40 - you placed um and those those are the
149:42 - three recorders that i like generally i
149:44 - don't have a good relationship with
149:45 - recruiters um so i do like to mention
149:48 - the ones that i feel that uh do care
149:50 - about you and are trying to do a good
149:51 - job and they're the ones that are
149:52 - working on contract and they're trying
149:54 - to push every person every applicant uh
149:56 - into that into that uh that box you know
150:02 - laurence uh do you have any friends who
150:04 - are
150:05 - applying for like large
150:07 - you know that we say fang but that could
150:09 - also include you know shopify could
150:11 - include infosys and microsoft and a lot
150:13 - of other big companies
150:17 - that are actively applying
150:20 - not that i know of um
150:23 - i feel like a lot of the people that
150:26 - i'm around either well actually honestly
150:27 - don't work in tech because i
150:30 - grew up i was not in tech at all right
150:31 - so a lot of my friends from college and
150:33 - before that are not in tech uh or like
150:36 - startups like my husband um just
150:39 - like we met actually at the last art
150:41 - that we worked at and now he just
150:43 - started his new startup i do this um so
150:47 - a lot of like the people that were kind
150:48 - of around a lot of the time are more so
150:51 - in the startup world but i have been
150:53 - reached out by or i have been reached
150:55 - out to from recruiters from
150:58 - google definitely and um
151:00 - one of the things that you're saying
151:01 - andrew in your example i know that at
151:04 - least one of the people it was because
151:06 - someone else i know that he was working
151:08 - at youtube he gave her my information
151:11 - because i also do think please correct
151:13 - me if i'm wrong um but say if i did end
151:16 - up working there he would get a referral
151:17 - he would get like a bonus right yes so
151:19 - like they really incentivized employees
151:22 - for good people
151:23 - yes yeah
151:25 - i i'm not sure if it's the same with
151:26 - candidates as well but yes
151:28 - yeah i don't yeah i'm not sure about
151:30 - that but yeah for the people who work
151:31 - there it's like good so they a lot of
151:33 - times will like
151:34 - share
151:35 - qualified people that they know of to
151:37 - the recruiters that work
151:39 - at those companies so
151:41 - yeah but
151:43 - yeah
151:44 - well
151:45 - so there's a pretty big gulf because a
151:47 - lot of people are in kind of startup
151:48 - land and other people are in like big
151:50 - company land like their they've kind of
151:52 - got their sites set on working for a big
151:54 - known company um
151:57 - uh
151:59 - elene what would be your advice to
152:01 - somebody because we already heard a
152:02 - little bit from andrew about applying to
152:04 - smaller startups uh but what how would
152:07 - you vary your approach if you were going
152:09 - to go on the job market today as a
152:11 - developer and you wanted to work at like
152:13 - a small upcoming
152:14 - company like for example code sandbox uh
152:16 - sid from code sandbox was on the
152:18 - previous one and they're they're growing
152:20 - they're still very small it's like i
152:21 - think you said like nine people maybe a
152:23 - company that has closer to like 50
152:25 - people like
152:26 - how would your approach be different
152:28 - there than applying to a microsoft or an
152:31 - amazon
152:32 - yeah depending on the company size let's
152:35 - say it's under 20 i would probably reach
152:38 - out directly to a founder
152:40 - and ideally the cto right
152:43 - that person is the one that has the most
152:46 - leeway to make exceptions companies of
152:49 - that size are typically biased against
152:51 - hiring junior talent because uh when
152:54 - you're that small you don't always have
152:55 - the luxury of thinking months years
152:57 - ahead you're often kind of thinking uh
153:00 - just a couple months ahead
153:02 - and that means that you may not have the
153:03 - bandwidth to train somebody up and
153:06 - depending on the constitution of your
153:07 - team you may not have the mentorship
153:09 - ability to get somebody from a to b
153:12 - right but
153:14 - rules are meant to be broken um people
153:16 - that are not the founder will probably
153:18 - be more risk-averse about breaking those
153:21 - rules because everybody has some amount
153:23 - of social capital at a company or and
153:25 - you use it you like you get a few shots
153:27 - right and you you try to spend it on
153:29 - things that are going to have the best
153:30 - outcome but if you're a founder you can
153:32 - do all sorts of crazy right so um i
153:35 - would i would probably reach out to a
153:37 - founder and um
153:39 - you know write the best most concise
153:42 - most authentic email that i can if i can
153:44 - get an introduction to them even better
153:46 - understand that founders are very very
153:48 - busy they're probably not spending more
153:50 - than a few seconds on any email so just
153:53 - say in the first two sentences
153:55 - who uh what you want and then explain
153:57 - why you deserve it and that's the whole
153:59 - email right maybe link to some things if
154:01 - you've done cool stuff uh for a slightly
154:04 - bigger company um who probably is hiring
154:06 - juniors because they do have that
154:08 - mentorship and within the ability to
154:10 - think ahead more
154:11 - um you may want to reach out to say a
154:13 - director of engineering um sometimes you
154:17 - get lucky and you find stuff they've
154:18 - written about hiring and if you can find
154:21 - something they've written about hiring
154:23 - and reference that and of course tell a
154:25 - compelling story about how hiring you
154:28 - fits into their world view and thesis
154:31 - that's a win they will definitely they
154:33 - might not hire you but they will at
154:34 - least answer you and once you have your
154:36 - foot in the door then it's just on you
154:38 - to show that you're capable um
154:40 - but you know uh in in this climate if
154:42 - you have a limited amount of time and i
154:45 - would probably not spend it on applying
154:47 - to very small companies because they're
154:49 - dropping like flies
154:52 - all right
154:54 - well that's some really good advice just
154:56 - just to recap what she said there a lot
154:58 - of people are proud of their hiring
155:00 - process and they will publicly write
155:01 - about it like i don't know if i've
155:03 - actually written about how free code
155:04 - camp hires but like
155:06 - if you want to work at free code camp
155:07 - you just have to be a prolific volunteer
155:10 - contributor and 100 of our hires come
155:13 - from people who are already essentially
155:15 - working as volunteers in the develop the
155:17 - developer community
155:19 - so if you can find like how they hire
155:22 - that can be huge information because you
155:24 - can just
155:25 - kind of go right into that flip stream
155:28 - and uh
155:29 - present yourself as an ideal model so
155:31 - knowing a lot about the interviewing
155:33 - party and their uh their thinking on
155:36 - things and how they think about yeah
155:41 - yes and we have been getting a lot of
155:42 - requests from twitter uh andrea would
155:45 - you mind re-sharing the recruiter's
155:47 - lists so i absolutely will yeah
155:50 - you should open source on github make a
155:53 - list or something and then share it with
155:55 - everybody
155:56 - oh yeah people tell me to do it i'll do
155:59 - it
156:00 - yeah and
156:01 - and laurence if you want to write
156:03 - something we would happily propagate
156:05 - these kinds of things because this is
156:06 - precisely what people are looking for is
156:08 - just some some information that they can
156:10 - go on uh but the one of the big
156:13 - takeaways i'm getting especially from
156:15 - hearing aileen uh talk is
156:18 - we should be
156:20 - practicing as much as possible and this
156:22 - might be a really great time to just
156:24 - really go deep on learning algorithms
156:26 - data structures design patterns and just
156:29 - getting really good at programming so
156:30 - that you can really nail those
156:32 - interviews
156:33 - you can apply to hundreds of jobs and
156:35 - you may have to apply to hundreds of
156:36 - jobs anyway to actually get uh
156:38 - interviews and get offers
156:41 - but that process will be much easier if
156:43 - when you actually do get those
156:44 - interviews and when you you know you're
156:47 - prepared
156:48 - what
156:49 - yeah
156:51 - so in terms of just very quick advice
156:53 - for like what people should prioritize
156:55 - and you know let's say that they have
156:58 - been handed this block of time that they
157:00 - you know had
157:01 - previously eight hours of sleep eight
157:02 - hours of work eight hours a leisure very
157:04 - few people actually had that split it's
157:05 - probably closer to like four hours of
157:07 - leisure maybe seven hours of sleep but
157:10 - if people do suddenly have a few extra
157:12 - hours a day
157:13 - what would be the most efficient
157:15 - allocation of that time and we're just
157:18 - going to go once around and that'll be
157:19 - our closing question uh we'll start with
157:21 - you aileen great
157:23 - so um
157:24 - if i it's going to depend on your
157:26 - seniority level so for this i'll assume
157:28 - that you're junior and you haven't done
157:30 - a lot of this before
157:31 - there's one great book whose name
157:33 - escapes me but that i will get after
157:35 - this and tweet it out
157:37 - the theme of the book is basically
157:39 - algorithms and data structures for
157:41 - non-technical people that just learn to
157:43 - code so it breaks it down in this very
157:46 - approachable way and isn't super mathy
157:48 - is just mathy enough
157:50 - um i think it's exceptional so i will
157:52 - get that uh that's step one is to just
157:54 - get your head around what you're dealing
157:56 - with step two is to work problems on
157:58 - your own
158:00 - there's leet code and then there's a
158:01 - great repository of problems that
158:04 - actually shows you exactly the steps
158:06 - that you would take to solve them called
158:07 - interview cake big fan of both of those
158:10 - step three once you've read a read a
158:12 - little bit about this and then actually
158:14 - work some problems is to start
158:16 - practicing um we are not the only
158:18 - practice site out there i think we do a
158:20 - great job but
158:21 - even if you don't use us if you go to
158:23 - interviewing dot io slash recordings or
158:26 - just go to our main site and then in the
158:27 - nav bar there's a link called watch
158:29 - interviews you can actually watch other
158:32 - people practicing it's kind of like a
158:34 - boring twitch
158:35 - if you will
158:36 - but if you haven't seen these interviews
158:38 - before you're just going to see what
158:40 - interviews are like with google
158:41 - engineers and microsoft engineers and
158:43 - linkedin engineers and airbnb and a
158:45 - bunch of other companies so just watch
158:47 - those
158:48 - and then once you get over the shock
158:51 - then start practicing because working
158:53 - problems on lead code is very very
158:56 - different than working a problem while
158:58 - somebody is breathing down your neck and
159:00 - watching your every move it's really
159:02 - really nerve-wracking but the good news
159:04 - is once you get used to it and once you
159:06 - get used to thinking out loud it gets
159:08 - better and then of course um potentially
159:10 - one of your practice interviewers who's
159:12 - probably from fang can refer you into
159:14 - that company so there's there's a
159:16 - journey if i were to do it
159:18 - awesome thank you alien uh
159:21 - and uh laurence if you were if you were
159:23 - going to go apply
159:24 - for a job and you had some time how
159:26 - would you how would you spend that time
159:28 - preparing for a job application spree
159:32 - yeah i think i mean everything that she
159:34 - said about interviewing was great
159:36 - information i think
159:37 - beyond that though just trying to build
159:39 - a community and build i don't like to
159:41 - use the word connections because it
159:43 - feels so like
159:45 - oh yeah i'm like going networking events
159:47 - which we can't even do right now can't
159:49 - go to meetups or networking events
159:51 - but just building friends essentially
159:53 - that work in the tech space so obviously
159:55 - free code camp is a great resource for
159:58 - that there's also a number of different
160:00 - slack communities for developers or for
160:03 - other folks that work in technology or
160:05 - design
160:06 - um there are online events like this and
160:09 - i know because i keep seeing a bunch in
160:11 - the news there's other kinds of online
160:13 - conferences and i imagine they have like
160:15 - maybe like virtual breakout groups of
160:16 - sorts where you can meet other people
160:19 - and i think that is just like a great
160:20 - way to spend your time right now and as
160:23 - you were i'm chatting before about
160:26 - getting jobs at startups i just
160:28 - remembered i had a flashback to someone
160:29 - i worked with at my last company who
160:31 - studied philosophy in college he was the
160:34 - company's first customer support hire
160:38 - he wasn't great at that role but he
160:40 - taught himself how to code on weekends
160:41 - and nights and he ended up building the
160:43 - first internal staff app no one asked
160:45 - him to do it he just did it on nights
160:47 - and weekends
160:48 - super helpful for the company he then
160:51 - became an engineer and now to this day
160:53 - it's like six years later he's leading
160:55 - the entire internal tools pod and has
160:58 - people reporting to him and this was
160:59 - someone who
161:00 - learned to code on nights and weekends
161:02 - has a philosophy degree and he just kind
161:04 - of showed up put himself out there did
161:07 - things on his own took you know
161:08 - initiative and of course made
161:10 - connections with people at the company
161:11 - or made friendships and he's still there
161:13 - to this day so i think just making
161:15 - yourself useful and building um or
161:17 - building friendships
161:19 - okay awesome and andrew oh cool yeah so
161:22 - i would say uh you want to build and
161:24 - ship and document okay so build
161:25 - applications ship them off to small
161:28 - startups document your your journey so
161:30 - so people can uh can find how you're
161:33 - doing stuff i believe there's a lot of
161:34 - startups small startups that are are
161:36 - hiring you you can uh create yourself
161:39 - your own role that is irreplaceable uh
161:42 - and i think there's a lot of there's
161:43 - companies that are going away but
161:45 - there's a lot of companies that are are
161:47 - thriving in this industry so look for
161:49 - those particular techs and try to focus
161:52 - your energies uh there and i think if
161:54 - you do those three things i think that's
161:56 - gonna be a lot more valuable than
161:57 - anything else because if you can produce
162:00 - a value or result for a company in the
162:02 - form of an application that is your
162:04 - proof right
162:05 - um so that's that would be my approach
162:08 - awesome well i want to thank all three
162:10 - of you uh everybody watching

164:18 - great to have you here uh next we have
164:21 - phoebe
164:23 - faddell
164:24 - she is a developer in the uk
164:27 - and she has also worked extensively as a
164:30 - freelancer and now is working full-time
164:33 - at a company as a developer um
164:35 - welcome phoebe
164:37 - thank you quincy
164:41 - it's good to have you here
164:43 - and
164:43 - we have luke siciliano who literally
164:47 - wrote the course and the book
164:50 - on uh freelancing and he has uh done
164:54 - an incredible amount of freelancing over
164:56 - the years
164:57 - he i believe has done
165:00 - 25 years worth of freelancing and
165:03 - running a consultancy that does
165:05 - freelance development work and seo
165:07 - consulting and things like that so
165:10 - we're
165:11 - privileged to have with
165:12 - with us this walking talking repository
165:15 - of freelancing wisdom
165:17 - so thank you very much for joining us
165:19 - luke oh well thanks for having me it's
165:21 - honestly it's my pleasure to be here so
165:24 - yeah
165:25 - well uh we are going to be talking
165:27 - extensively about freelancing this is
165:30 - a time when many people are looking for
165:32 - work uh many people have unfortunately
165:35 - lost their jobs just in the united
165:37 - states alone uh unemployment claims
165:39 - which is just people who can actually
165:41 - successfully get through the phone to
165:42 - claim unemployment benefits
165:45 - uh 16
165:46 - million people over the past three weeks
165:48 - so this has been absolutely devastating
165:51 - uh to people
165:53 - here in the us and i imagine also in in
165:56 - nigeria and in the uk and europe uh and
166:01 - we are going to um
166:04 - we're going to delve into all that but i
166:06 - just want to preface this with
166:08 - everybody who has
166:10 - who's listening here who has been laid
166:11 - off or has been furloughed
166:15 - we're very sad about that situation
166:18 - we're gonna do everything we can in our
166:20 - power to give you the tools that you can
166:22 - go out
166:23 - and you can find other organizations in
166:26 - need small businesses large businesses
166:29 - uh
166:30 - non-profits
166:32 - other organizations and that you can
166:33 - help them solve their own problems
166:35 - uh through technology as a as a
166:38 - freelancer so
166:40 - um my first question
166:42 - to all three of you uh and and we can
166:44 - start with phoebe um
166:48 - what
166:49 - is freelance software development and
166:51 - how would you describe
166:53 - the field of freelancing as far as
166:57 - you know doing software development
167:00 - um so from my experience i i freelance
167:04 - for experience because um i'm a career
167:07 - changer so i went from one industry into
167:09 - another and
167:10 - a lot of what i was doing i was learning
167:12 - at home
167:13 - and i wasn't having that kind of
167:16 - sort of more practical experience so i
167:18 - started freelancing and
167:20 - the easiest thing for me to do was to do
167:23 - wordpress sites because it's you know
167:25 - it's very low cost
167:27 - for the client and
167:30 - so from that point of view
167:32 - i kind of approached um sort of local
167:35 - businesses
167:36 - and family and asked them if they wanted
167:39 - websites so i started quite low-key
167:42 - um purely for experience um
167:45 - and it kind of like snowballed from
167:47 - there really because i just did one site
167:49 - and then word got around and then it
167:52 - kind of you know kind of had a life of
167:54 - his own so um yeah so i think for me it
167:57 - was started off just to get some
167:58 - experience but then it kind of became a
168:00 - bit of a side business next to my
168:02 - studying and also i was looking after my
168:04 - two kids at home because i was a
168:06 - stay-at-home mom as well so for me you
168:08 - know
168:09 - you know i i wasn't aiming for something
168:12 - that i was going to do for long term but
168:13 - it kind of ended up that way
168:16 - yeah and if if anybody is interested in
168:18 - phoebe's story it's really remarkable
168:21 - and uh she's written about it at length
168:23 - uh if you just google from stay at home
168:25 - mom to
168:26 - freelance developer i think is the
168:27 - headline you'll pull it up
168:29 - maybe somebody can share it in the chat
168:31 - for everybody
168:33 - but so phoebe used freelance development
168:36 - as a way to transition into tech and i
168:38 - think that's pretty common uh bolaji how
168:41 - about you how would you describe
168:43 - freelance development and and your
168:45 - experience freelancing in the past
168:49 - okay
168:50 - um so
168:51 - basically i've been freelancing for like
168:53 - two years now and
168:54 - at the point when i started i was just
168:56 - possibly a beginner and like
168:58 - you know before you get hired you have
168:59 - to get a point where you're really
169:00 - experienced at least um surpass the
169:02 - interviews and all that right
169:04 - so at that point i wasn't really so good
169:07 - but i knew what i was doing and so
169:08 - that's one of the best way i could
169:09 - practice my skills you know try it out
169:11 - with friends families and know hey i can
169:13 - do this i can do that and all that so
169:16 - and then people were really interested
169:17 - in help having me
169:19 - build stuff for them and then through
169:21 - that i was able to get started with
169:23 - building projects and all that and
169:26 - i was able to build stuff like a lot of
169:28 - stuff and then i had um so many clients
169:31 - around me and then while growing i was
169:32 - learning more and then i eventually um
169:35 - got hired and started working
169:37 - professionally but still i still feel as
169:39 - even up to now like a few days like
169:41 - virtually every month because like i
169:42 - started with freelance and like it's
169:44 - really cool
169:47 - awesome and uh luke tell us a little bit
169:49 - about your experience in 25 years ago
169:52 - how you got into freelancing um i would
169:54 - say more than anything it really just
169:56 - started by coming across a few people
169:58 - with some problems that i knew how to
170:00 - solve
170:02 - the specific answer to your question is
170:05 - i got asked to write an app for a local
170:08 - deli that wanted to have a street
170:09 - fighter 2 tournament back when playing
170:11 - games in the arcade was
170:13 - like actually a thing so i wrote an app
170:15 - so he could track that and then
170:17 - one thing led to another i would really
170:19 - just define freelancing more than
170:20 - anything else as
170:22 - as an individual solving
170:24 - other people's problems i mean and as
170:27 - long as you just keep doing that people
170:28 - are going to keep calling you
170:31 - [Music]
170:32 - okay awesome
170:33 - and
170:34 - uh let's start with talking about what
170:37 - kind of how the market may have changed
170:40 - for freelance developers because prior
170:42 - to freelance developers you know we
170:44 - weren't in a global recession like we
170:46 - are now a lot of people had a lot more
170:48 - cash on hand
170:49 - now
170:50 - things may have tightened a little bit
170:52 - the kind of people who are looking for
170:53 - freelance help
170:55 - may not be looking anymore others may
170:57 - have new problems that they're looking
170:58 - for freelancers to solve
171:01 - perhaps you could talk a little bit
171:03 - about uh the kinds of new clients you're
171:05 - getting
171:06 - luke and and how they're approaching you
171:09 - um right now i would say it it's the
171:12 - markets definitely changed in number one
171:14 - like you were saying earlier i mean
171:15 - we're all really fortunate to be in a
171:17 - spot where we can keep working right now
171:18 - as opposed to being furloughed and
171:22 - so i'm just kind of trying to make the
171:23 - most of that opportunity
171:25 - in terms of
171:26 - clients right now the first thing i
171:28 - noticed is
171:30 - quite a bit coming in from
171:32 - current or previous customers
171:34 - just to give an example
171:36 - i built a progressive web app for a
171:38 - small church about a year ago and
171:41 - because of what's going on they couldn't
171:42 - hold services so they wanted to
171:44 - integrate video streaming into their
171:46 - website so
171:47 - getting a
171:49 - surprising number of calls from either
171:51 - customers i've been helping on an
171:52 - ongoing basis or previous customers just
171:54 - needing
171:55 - something else done
171:57 - in some regard
172:00 - in terms of other business beyond that i
172:03 - think that this has
172:05 - really
172:06 - created possibilities
172:08 - while i know a lot of people
172:10 - may look at a time of crisis like this
172:12 - and think that possibilities may be
172:14 - decreasing it's true that a lot of
172:16 - possibilities decrease but other ones
172:18 - open up because
172:21 - anytime anything creates a problem for
172:22 - small businesses that's a problem that
172:24 - needs to be solved
172:26 - and nine times out of ten or a lot of i
172:29 - shouldn't say nine times that temp a lot
172:30 - of times developers can
172:32 - solve those kinds of problems so it's
172:34 - definitely creating opportunities
172:36 - anything ranging from
172:38 - for example um
172:40 - the small local restaurant that knows
172:42 - they've
172:43 - needed a new website an app for the last
172:45 - 10 years and they've just never gotten
172:47 - around to it now all of a sudden they're
172:48 - prioritizing that so
172:50 - you know people can order online um you
172:54 - know the consulting firm that's used to
172:55 - dealing with people one-on-one now
172:57 - they've got to deal with everyone
172:58 - virtually so they need a mechanism where
173:00 - people can securely submit documents to
173:02 - them
173:02 - um things like that this has really
173:04 - changed the
173:06 - business needs of a lot of different
173:07 - types of companies out there now that
173:09 - those are problems that developers can
173:11 - solve so those are the new kinds of
173:13 - customers i'm largely seeing as people
173:15 - that
173:16 - now have a problem
173:18 - that they didn't have before and they
173:19 - need that
173:20 - problem solved and like i said that's
173:22 - after
173:23 - just doing things for previous customers
173:27 - yeah and that makes perfect sense so
173:29 - your previous customers are proactively
173:31 - reaching out to you because you're on
173:32 - their radar
173:34 - right and and they know that you have
173:36 - proven that you're capable of solving
173:38 - the problems in the past so they're
173:39 - reaching back out to you um
173:42 - phoebe if you were to
173:44 - uh like not magically not be working in
173:47 - your current job hopefully that doesn't
173:48 - happen
173:50 - but let's say hypothetically you were to
173:52 - go back on the market as a freelancer
173:54 - like how would you re-establish contact
173:57 - with
173:57 - past customers and let let them know
173:59 - like hey i'm i'm back in business and
174:02 - whom would you approach and like what
174:04 - would be your general strategy for that
174:07 - um well actually i maintain contact with
174:10 - all my clients a lot of them um i have
174:13 - like a care package with them so i
174:15 - maintain their domain and their hosting
174:18 - and i get in touch with them you know
174:21 - once every couple of months and sort of
174:23 - say is everything okay just checking in
174:25 - so i kind of maintain that relationship
174:27 - with them anyway
174:29 - um but in terms of sort of finding new
174:32 - clients i think it's just um
174:35 - usually actually i get approached i get
174:37 - approached now um even when i'm working
174:40 - full-time
174:41 - um and
174:43 - with the pandemic actually i think
174:45 - people have had that kind of downtime
174:46 - when they start thinking about
174:48 - um i should really get back into looking
174:51 - into that website i need to update so
174:53 - i've had um
174:55 - actually a few contacts that i've got in
174:57 - touch with me saying
174:58 - can you work on the website so a lot
175:00 - unfortunately i've had to turn people
175:01 - away but i've referred it to other
175:03 - people i know in the field
175:04 - um
175:06 - so
175:06 - it's kind of it's kind of a strange
175:08 - situation because i noticed that the
175:10 - work stopped and then the moment that
175:12 - this horrible situation happened people
175:14 - started getting back in touch so um i
175:16 - guess like you know i would probably
175:18 - approach local businesses
175:20 - see if they're okay and sort of say do
175:22 - you need any kind of updating
175:25 - um and that's what i did when i was
175:27 - freelancing anyway i would sort of make
175:29 - contact and usually through
175:32 - my existing networks so it doesn't come
175:34 - across as cold calling i guess so you
175:37 - know say hey i know this person you know
175:39 - heard that you might possibly need a
175:41 - website updating
175:43 - and i think that works best kind of
175:45 - building that trust
175:46 - um and you know having that kind of
175:48 - credibility already so it's you know if
175:50 - you get referred on by someone else that
175:52 - really helps
175:53 - so
175:55 - awesome and it's great to hear both of
175:57 - you have existing relationships that are
175:59 - continuing with these people and
176:01 - a lot of things that if you're new to
176:02 - freelancing you may think oh i built
176:04 - that and it's done but it sounds like a
176:06 - lot of your work uh as a freelancer is
176:10 - maintenance of code and making sure that
176:11 - things continue to work would you would
176:13 - you say that's accurate phoebe
176:15 - yeah i agree yeah definitely and it's
176:17 - just you know
176:18 - a lot of time you know um
176:21 - some of my clients don't have a massive
176:23 - budget so they say oh i want this and i
176:25 - said
176:26 - but they can't afford to do it and i
176:27 - said well that's fine you know we can
176:28 - build features on top you know once you
176:31 - get the budget um
176:33 - so it's it's you know so it's kind of
176:35 - prioritizing what they want and what
176:37 - they need and trying to differentiate
176:39 - the you know
176:41 - rather desire versus what they actually
176:43 - need to get the website off you know so
176:46 - um
176:46 - yeah so i say definitely maintenance and
176:49 - just adding new features as well um it's
176:52 - just kind of a continued relationship
176:55 - awesome and uh fazel uh within the
176:58 - hashnow community what pro what
177:00 - proportion of people would you say that
177:01 - are really active on hash node are
177:03 - interested in freelancing or doing
177:05 - freelance development
177:06 - um i would say uh we don't get a lot of
177:09 - questions or discussions specifically
177:11 - for
177:12 - related to freelancing so uh
177:16 - i'm not sure that we can i can come up
177:18 - with a number on number of people who
177:20 - are actively looking for freelancers on
177:21 - hash product because uh
177:24 - we don't get questions on those uh on on
177:26 - this area
177:29 - okay well well do you
177:31 - uh have you noticed any discussions
177:34 - around this uh yeah uh with linking yes
177:37 - yes uh one question that i have um like
177:40 - uh often come across is people like
177:42 - there are developers who are uh
177:44 - trying to get into freelancing for the
177:46 - first time there's maybe there's maybe
177:48 - new new uh developers beginner
177:51 - developers or experienced developers so
177:53 - what advice do you have for
177:55 - people like this how can they start
177:57 - their freelancing career
178:00 - okay awesome uh and uh have any of you
178:04 - found like aside from uh luke's
178:07 - comprehensive course by the way uh it's
178:09 - right here on this youtube channel you
178:10 - can check it out after this if you're
178:11 - interested in freelancing uh it's
178:14 - several hours long and it he also has
178:17 - like a lawyer
178:18 - like a small business lawyer and like an
178:20 - accountant uh so it's kind of full
178:22 - spectrum small business
178:24 - advice for people who want to become
178:26 - freelance developers and i strongly
178:27 - encourage everybody to check that out
178:29 - aside from that
178:31 - what are some other resources you all
178:33 - have found over the years that you've
178:35 - found helped you a lot
178:38 - communities
178:39 - or other learning resources that are
178:42 - useful for
178:44 - premises that they should be aware of
178:48 - i would i honestly think the things i
178:51 - found most useful are
178:53 - not necessarily even uh related to
178:56 - uh working as a coder or freelancing in
178:58 - general but just uh general business
179:01 - books uh general personal finance books
179:04 - things of that nature um i strongly
179:07 - strongly and a whole bunch of stronglys
179:10 - think that you know working for yourself
179:12 - as a developer or working for yourself
179:15 - as an independent baker or working for
179:17 - yourself running you know as an
179:18 - independent auto mechanic really aren't
179:20 - all that different i think
179:22 - you know a lot of it just kind of comes
179:24 - down to
179:25 - the same ideas and some same basic
179:28 - principles um
179:30 - so i think anyone who is trying to
179:32 - strike out on their own right now in
179:34 - addition to
179:35 - just reading as much as they can about
179:37 - uh you know i guess i'm trying to say
179:39 - don't limit your reading to
179:41 - how do i start up my independent dev
179:43 - shop or how do i start making money as a
179:45 - freelancer start reading as much as
179:47 - reading and absorbing as much as you can
179:49 - about being self-employed in general
179:51 - i would say that that's the probably the
179:52 - best resource that a lot of people could
179:55 - engage in
179:56 - a couple of books i would probably
179:58 - suggest just off the top of my head
180:01 - um one is called the millionaire next
180:03 - door
180:04 - um i actually think that should be
180:05 - required reading in high school so
180:06 - that's just you know my personal opinion
180:08 - which you know it doesn't count for much
180:10 - obviously
180:11 - that one
180:13 - a book called the innovators by walter
180:15 - isaacson
180:17 - is you know like a really really good
180:19 - one and a book called profit first
180:22 - which is really just about managing the
180:24 - finances of a small business profit
180:26 - first might even be the first one i
180:27 - would say somebody should read right now
180:30 - yeah and i haven't read the millionaire
180:32 - next door but my understanding is it's
180:33 - an older book and it it really
180:36 - uh the book's
180:38 - core thesis i think is that anybody
180:40 - who's working like a middle class type
180:42 - job and this may not be completely true
180:44 - in 2020 where we've got you know
180:46 - a lot of people working as contractors
180:48 - and having limited access to opportunity
180:50 - but people who are making like the
180:52 - median level wage for an american which
180:54 - would in america it's about i think it's
180:56 - like sixty thousand dollars is now the
180:58 - median wage it's gone up a little bit um
181:01 - if you can figure out ways to cut costs
181:03 - and save a whole lot of money you can
181:05 - use that as a nice cushion and you can
181:07 - invest that in the stock market maybe
181:09 - not the stock market but you'll you'll
181:11 - get
181:13 - enough recurring
181:15 - revenue from that that it just keeps
181:17 - reinvesting and i think it's like the
181:18 - benjamin franklin quote about like the
181:20 - most powerful forcing the universe's
181:22 - compound interest right uh
181:24 - yeah actually that may have been
181:25 - einstein quote because it doesn't sound
181:27 - as profound coming from somebody who's
181:29 - focused on money but from somebody who's
181:31 - focused on science i think that compound
181:33 - interest is so powerful uh so
181:36 - so just to
181:38 - to process a little bit about what luke
181:40 - said there
181:41 - general business books can be just as
181:43 - helpful as anything else because a lot
181:45 - of what you're trying to do
181:46 - is figure out the physics of business
181:48 - uh so that you can keep your
181:50 - organization alive and that ultimately
181:52 - you can provide your for your family and
181:54 - uh
181:55 - you know keep the the cash coming in
181:56 - which is the lifeblood of any business
181:59 - um
182:00 - so so thank thanks for sharing this uh
182:03 - yeah so one question that we have is
182:06 - how can uh freelancers market themselves
182:09 - developers developer freelancers can
182:11 - market themselves during these times
182:13 - right if they are starting out what uh
182:16 - do you have any tips for them
182:18 - and it'd be great to get uh your
182:20 - perspective on this belagi if you have
182:22 - advice since
182:23 - um i know uh nigeria is very competitive
182:26 - market there are a lot of really skilled
182:28 - developers there
182:29 - yeah yeah
182:31 - right
182:32 - so when it comes to marketing it starts
182:35 - from your network itself um it's much
182:37 - more like internal than external so
182:39 - marketing starts from your small peers
182:41 - like your friends your families your
182:44 - neighbors and all that so like you start
182:45 - marketing from people around you um like
182:48 - your closest sphere should understand
182:49 - that this is what i do and then they are
182:51 - the ones who like go out and market you
182:53 - external and say oh i have a friend that
182:55 - does this so you possibly might not be
182:57 - able to reach out to someone um let's
182:59 - secrecy i might not be able to reach out
183:01 - to chris's friends but quincy knows me
183:03 - right and he knows i i do the stuff and
183:05 - i do it well enough so quincy can go out
183:07 - and talk to his friends about me and say
183:09 - oh i do this stuff and then that's it
183:12 - they reach out to queen c and queen c
183:13 - connects me today i'm like i've done
183:15 - like huge marketing right there like
183:17 - without having to um
183:19 - do a lot of marketing strategies and all
183:21 - that like i just work with my peers and
183:22 - work with my friends right
183:24 - and another great option you might want
183:26 - to try out is social media like that's a
183:28 - really good place to like market
183:30 - yourself one thing you should note about
183:31 - marketing is people would um
183:34 - love you if they can see what you're
183:36 - doing right so like i'm not just
183:37 - marketing and saying hey i can view this
183:39 - stuff and then that's it no i told you i
183:42 - can do this stuff and this is the stuff
183:43 - i've built right and then i look at it
183:45 - and i'm like wow this is awesome i like
183:46 - it like how can i reach out to you can
183:48 - you do the same stuff for me right so i
183:51 - am marketing with like proof i'm showing
183:52 - them samples of stuff i've done and then
183:54 - through that i can get more um clients
183:56 - and more returns from that so it's very
183:58 - simple start marketing from your peers
184:01 - like your small friends and families and
184:03 - then as much as you're trying to market
184:04 - on social media or other platform try as
184:06 - much as possible to show samples show
184:08 - them stuff you build like live projects
184:10 - and all that and through that you would
184:12 - be able to like
184:13 - get a lot of clients that would be
184:14 - interested in you and even if they would
184:16 - not be interested at that moment like
184:18 - it's more like stored in their catalogue
184:20 - and they're like ah there's this guy i
184:22 - saw like one month ago oh i'm used to
184:24 - this awesome stuff right and i want to
184:26 - reach out to him so like just by doing
184:28 - that alone you're preparing like
184:30 - more clients for yourself so that's it
184:32 - basically
184:34 - awesome and uh
184:37 - one question that we have from chat is
184:40 - uh how do you figure out how much to
184:42 - charge as a
184:44 - freelance developer and uh how do you
184:47 - triangulate prices that clients will
184:49 - actually pay you
184:52 - that's a hard one
184:57 - yeah i mean like i think for me um
185:00 - because i was new to the scene and i
185:04 - hadn't had much experience um i kind of
185:07 - just did it as i'm starting from the
185:09 - bottom i'm just going to charge my time
185:12 - because i'm getting experience people
185:13 - are taking a chance from me
185:15 - and i kind of took it from there really
185:17 - and also with demand so the more demand
185:19 - that came in
185:21 - i kind of adjusted my prices accordingly
185:23 - because you know um
185:25 - so
185:26 - i i kind of like response to market
185:28 - almost but at the start i did kind of
185:30 - offer a i built um my first site for
185:34 - free
185:35 - because i wanted the experience i kind
185:36 - of want to do a
185:38 - real kind of client relationship but not
185:40 - have kind of pressure on myself
185:42 - and then um and then from there i kind
185:45 - of did what i would call the equivalent
185:47 - of minimum wage
185:49 - um and then once i kind of built up my
185:51 - confidence and i thought ah okay and now
185:53 - i can start charging kind of more the
185:55 - rates that i i think equate with my
185:57 - skills so it's just kind of building up
185:59 - from there really and you know it's it's
186:01 - a hard one i mean like it also depends
186:04 - on your clients budget
186:05 - and you kind of don't want to
186:08 - undersell yourself
186:10 - but you also have to sort of if they say
186:12 - we've only got x amount of pounds to do
186:14 - this site you can say i can build this
186:17 - this and this for you and you kind of
186:18 - prioritize what can be built so
186:21 - i would say it just depends on your
186:23 - experience
186:24 - and
186:26 - and
186:27 - just take it from there really the more
186:28 - you build
186:29 - the bigger your reputation becomes you
186:31 - get more kind of clout and then you can
186:34 - probably just start charging a bit more
186:36 - so i kind of adjusted as i went along
186:40 - and that makes that makes sense and
186:42 - that's a really reasonable way to
186:44 - approach it
186:45 - um
186:46 - and how about you luke like how have you
186:47 - negotiated uh
186:49 - price elasticity
186:51 - among your uh your clients
186:54 - um fortunately right now i'm kind of in
186:57 - a phase where my price is my price and
187:00 - i don't don't negotiate it down too much
187:03 - to be frank um
187:05 - now if i wasn't in that situation um i
187:08 - think what phoebe said uh just said hits
187:11 - the nail on the head more than anything
187:14 - when she said
187:16 - uh
187:17 - when the client says here's my budget
187:19 - and you say
187:20 - i can do a b and c
187:22 - um to do
187:24 - i just think that's an import just such
187:26 - an important part of selling something
187:28 - and coming up with the right price if
187:30 - you know if a customer says
187:33 - you know i want items one two and three
187:36 - and and the developer just says here's
187:39 - what it's going to cost and they say
187:40 - that's not what's in my budget
187:42 - that that's kind of the developer saying
187:44 - too bad and then you know the person's
187:46 - obviously not going to buy the services
187:48 - and
187:49 - it's not good for anybody
187:51 - another way to think of that is don't
187:53 - end by telling somebody no right if
187:56 - somebody says i need one two and three
187:58 - and this is my budget
188:00 - and you just say no
188:02 - then that's just the end of the
188:04 - conversation whereas what if you say
188:06 - here's what i can do for you so it's
188:08 - kind of like well um you know i can't
188:10 - build you your own uh you know i can't
188:13 - you know i can't build your own uh
188:15 - video player but i'm happy to embed
188:17 - youtube for you so you can stream it
188:18 - live so in other words end with what you
188:20 - can do for them as opposed to what you
188:22 - can't do for them and then they suddenly
188:24 - feel like they're getting a deal within
188:25 - their limited budget and it helps make
188:27 - the sale helps keeps the price down it
188:29 - just works out better for everybody
188:32 - and a lot of times uh clients may not
188:35 - know what they want
188:36 - and they may but they do know what the
188:38 - problem is so they're the stakeholder
188:40 - they can describe what the problem is
188:42 - and as a freelancer you can interpret
188:45 - that problem into a potential solution
188:47 - and right size it and you know make it
188:49 - like like you just said the cost of
188:51 - creating your own video streaming stool
188:53 - and uh having your own video player and
188:55 - all that stuff may be prohibitive but
188:57 - the cost of embedding youtube may only
189:00 - be you know a day's work uh to be able
189:03 - to have them have a tool where they can
189:05 - update the video and everything right so
189:07 - yeah yeah
189:09 - i think what you just said is actually
189:10 - really really important um i've finished
189:12 - uh two sports related apps for different
189:14 - clients i would so doesn't matter let's
189:17 - call it within
189:18 - the last 30 days and
189:20 - um
189:21 - you know and everybody else on the panel
189:23 - will can talk we'll say this too that
189:25 - you know when we get clients that call
189:27 - us
189:27 - a client will say
189:29 - you know i want whatever it is they want
189:32 - and it's really important to give those
189:33 - clients feedback you can give them
189:35 - possibilities that they didn't know they
189:37 - had in front of them they obviou they'll
189:40 - instantly see how those possibilities
189:42 - can
189:42 - you know help their business and it's
189:44 - also important to give them feedback if
189:46 - they're saying they want certain
189:47 - features or functionality that you know
189:49 - from having done something similar is
189:50 - probably a bad idea it's important to in
189:53 - polite terms explain to them why it's a
189:55 - bad idea why they shouldn't you know
189:57 - spend the money on that and
189:58 - um so on and so forth and that also just
190:01 - really goes a long way towards a getting
190:03 - people to sign up for with you be you
190:06 - know helping them you know get the most
190:08 - for you know like their money and and
190:10 - things of that um you know it's really
190:12 - important as a freelancer to think
190:14 - yourself as a problem solver and it's
190:16 - hard to solve a problem without giving
190:17 - feedback to somebody right um so i just
190:21 - i just think you really just hit the
190:22 - nail on the head that's really important
190:24 - to not just take a call and say someone
190:27 - says to you
190:28 - i want one two and three and you just
190:30 - say okay it's really important to give
190:31 - them that feedback
190:34 - um i just want to add to what luke said
190:36 - um yeah i mean i completely agree about
190:39 - giving the client feedback because a lot
190:41 - of the time
190:42 - they don't know what they want or they
190:44 - don't know how the best way to solve the
190:46 - problem
190:46 - so um and i find that you know some
190:49 - people probably think oh i shouldn't
190:51 - really say that i think i'm being
190:52 - critical but in fact they appreciate the
190:55 - advice because you're
190:56 - you know you you have more experience
190:58 - that you know what you're talking about
190:59 - so um they're like i never thought of it
191:02 - that way so actually giving back
191:04 - feedback is is probably a good thing and
191:06 - you should be honest as well i think
191:08 - that's that's another thing don't just
191:09 - keep on saying yes yes i think that's a
191:12 - great idea i think being honest and they
191:14 - actually do appreciate that so
191:16 - yeah i just wanted to add that to luke's
191:19 - comments
191:20 - awesome uh i have an interesting
191:22 - question for luke uh look if you had to
191:25 - start freelancing today what are the
191:27 - three things you would not do
191:30 - what are the three things i would not do
191:32 - if i had to start
191:34 - that list is probably a lot longer than
191:35 - three things first of all um and it
191:37 - would also include a lot of the mistakes
191:39 - i made early on um
191:41 - if i had to
191:43 - start over today um i would say
191:47 - some of the things um that i would
191:50 - definitely stay away from and this is
191:52 - going to sound
191:53 - counterintuitive
191:56 - to a lot of people
191:59 - i wouldn't focus on trying to get as
192:02 - many sales as possible on day one i
192:04 - would really focus on trying to get that
192:06 - first sale and
192:07 - doing as good a job for that client as i
192:10 - could
192:12 - in other words get that first product in
192:14 - and probably just focus on that until
192:16 - it's out the door because then not only
192:18 - have you been paid for a completed
192:19 - product you've got someone who's a
192:21 - potential referral source now because
192:22 - you've just done a really good job for
192:24 - them um
192:26 - so one thing i think a lot of people
192:29 - a big mistake a lot of people make early
192:30 - on myself included is how do i get my
192:33 - name out there to
192:34 - as many people as possible on day one
192:36 - it's like no no get your name out there
192:38 - to one person who will hire you today
192:40 - you know that's
192:42 - that's probably the first thing i would
192:44 - do
192:44 - the second thing i would definitely
192:48 - avoid
192:49 - and this is going to sound
192:51 - counter-intuitive
192:53 - to a lot of people is
192:55 - i would avoid going to a lot of
192:56 - networking events
192:58 - which is another mistake i made early on
193:02 - um
193:03 - you know once when you go to a
193:04 - networking event there are so many hours
193:06 - in a day and that time is gone forever
193:08 - and for the most part
193:11 - it's all they're all a little different
193:12 - but for the most part you're hoping to
193:13 - meet people that will connect you with
193:15 - other people at networking events
193:17 - i think if you're going to go out and
193:18 - try to sell yourself to people like that
193:20 - it's you can just as easily spend that
193:22 - time walking into the local bakery and
193:24 - saying hey you know i notice you don't
193:26 - have online ordering i notice you don't
193:28 - have this let me solve these problems so
193:30 - go out and try to meet your customers
193:32 - one on one as opposed to trying to meet
193:34 - them through other people that was
193:35 - another mistake you know i made
193:37 - early on um
193:40 - and i would say the
193:42 - third mistake um that i probably made
193:45 - early on that i would uh definitely not
193:48 - repeat is
193:50 - and this may sound like i'm on my
193:52 - soapbox but
193:53 - you know definitely learning as much as
193:55 - i can about the business issues from day
193:57 - one getting set up for proper tax
194:00 - structures and
194:01 - things of that nature
194:03 - um because kind of what quincy was
194:05 - saying about compound interest earlier
194:07 - is really true and if you start off with
194:10 - some bad structures in place
194:12 - and by structures i mean
194:14 - how you've structured your business for
194:16 - taxes um how you've set up some of your
194:18 - workflows and those kinds of things if
194:20 - you start off in a bad spot those things
194:22 - are just going to compound as you start
194:24 - getting uh more customers and more and
194:27 - more money bleeds out of your business
194:28 - as a result of it
194:30 - so you know in not necessarily in those
194:33 - orders in that order those are the three
194:35 - things i would really
194:37 - not do is you know and again i think
194:39 - what i did early on is what a lot of
194:40 - people do i thought oh boy i'm in
194:42 - business and i just went
194:44 - plowing out without thinking about
194:46 - how do i structure things for taxes and
194:48 - you know like like things of that nature
194:50 - and at the end of the year i regretted
194:51 - it you know like way back when so
194:54 - wow that's a great list
194:57 - how about you phoebe
194:59 - um
195:01 - i would say
195:02 - yeah i mean it's it's it's different
195:04 - from because i used to work for a
195:06 - company they took care of you know
195:09 - paying me or the taxes
195:11 - and there's quite a steep learning curve
195:13 - when you go self-employed you know
195:16 - you have to you know you have to do
195:18 - self-assessment in the uk you have to be
195:20 - aware of you know you have to have um
195:23 - insurance
195:24 - to make sure that you know that you
195:26 - don't get if you get sued you're covered
195:28 - you know things like that that you don't
195:29 - necessarily think about because you you
195:31 - haven't had to think about it yet so i
195:33 - think it's like what luke said it's just
195:35 - kind of having that infrastructure in
195:36 - place you know using kind of an online
195:39 - accounting tools um
195:41 - so i started using wave which was an
195:44 - invoicing tool rather than producing
195:46 - them
195:47 - um you know things like that just kind
195:49 - of learn as you go on the job um but it
195:52 - is quite hard i mean i think you have to
195:54 - have to be prepared for that you you
195:56 - know you don't have someone else taking
195:57 - care of that you don't have like a hr
195:59 - department you don't have a
196:01 - finance department you know so it's all
196:03 - you
196:04 - so if you are going to freelancing just
196:06 - just kind of be aware of that and um
196:09 - read up on it make sure you're aware of
196:12 - what's you know you need to do to to um
196:15 - so that you don't get hit by the tax man
196:17 - and you get fined etc so um yeah i mean
196:20 - i think for me i didn't realize how much
196:22 - was involved um and i wish i was better
196:25 - prepared for it at the beginning but you
196:27 - know once i did learn i i made sure that
196:30 - i caught up with it so
196:33 - awesome
196:34 - and uh bolaji
196:36 - what are some things that you made
196:38 - mistakes you made early on that you've
196:40 - uh
196:41 - kind of learned from okay
196:43 - yeah um so the first thing would be
196:45 - understanding that i'm freelancing it's
196:47 - not just about writing code like it's
196:49 - way much more than just writing code
196:50 - like it's it decompasses communication
196:53 - marketing and so much more so like if
196:55 - you focus at the early stage is just
196:57 - writing code you would miss out from so
196:59 - many goodies i've had times where i had
197:01 - to write like serious complex features
197:04 - for the clients but meanwhile they
197:05 - really don't want all that and then at
197:06 - the end i have to like cut down most of
197:08 - these things and i'm like what this is
197:10 - really good like you need this you need
197:11 - and then like i don't need it i know
197:13 - that's right so um the ability to
197:15 - communicate well with your clients it's
197:17 - very very essential because like luke
197:18 - said like most of them don't know what
197:20 - they want and most of when they have
197:22 - ideas of what he wants but like not like
197:24 - the full idea and then when they tell
197:25 - you i want x and then tell them oh you
197:28 - can you can get like an x y z or
197:30 - something like oh this is cool and most
197:32 - time you can tell them um you can get
197:33 - like an x y z and they tell you um i
197:35 - don't really need that that's too
197:36 - complex for me at the moment and then
197:38 - you have to go back and forth i'm trying
197:40 - to communicate with them it's like first
197:42 - of all on the standard it's not just
197:43 - about writing code like it's way much
197:45 - more than that so if you're working for
197:46 - a company you have tax and also you just
197:48 - go just pick a ticket and just work on
197:50 - your tax for freelancing you're trying
197:52 - to build something for someone who is
197:54 - not you it's like you have to put
197:55 - yourself in their position and try to
197:56 - understand what they want and
197:59 - this also leads to like my second um
198:00 - regrets that i would like which i never
198:02 - did is try as much as possible to give
198:05 - feedback to your clients like um let's
198:07 - say weekly okay let's say the deadline
198:09 - for the project is like one month try to
198:11 - give like demos in like maybe four times
198:14 - in a month because like if you wait to
198:15 - the end of the one month you might
198:17 - present the entire day when they're like
198:19 - wow why this why it happened you have to
198:20 - go back and revert so many things like
198:22 - right so you can do weekly demos with
198:24 - them and then the first week you look at
198:26 - it and tell you what um i change this
198:28 - and change that and you can easily
198:30 - revise because it's not going so far but
198:32 - like imagine you've gone like one month
198:33 - into the project you have to go back to
198:35 - like three weeks ago like that's really
198:37 - really stressful so the ability to give
198:39 - feedbacks to your clients like um weekly
198:42 - or like three days it's very very
198:43 - important and i think the last one for
198:46 - me would be to automate stuff like i
198:47 - made
198:49 - i always tell people like
198:51 - as much as we are developers like we
198:53 - have so much to do like there's so much
198:55 - to do you have to install this installed
198:56 - and like the tooling we use is quite
198:58 - much more than the code we actually
198:59 - write so like one thing we should try to
199:01 - do is um automate stuff and that's one
199:03 - mistake i never did so like the time i
199:05 - spent trying to do some basic stuff if i
199:07 - had automated them i wouldn't have to
199:09 - spend that time doing those things so
199:10 - like you can use aliases and and so much
199:12 - more like try to automate some of your
199:14 - toolings and workflows so it makes um it
199:16 - gives you much more time to like do more
199:18 - works like that's it
199:22 - awesome that's an excellent answer all
199:24 - three of you have a lot of wisdom on
199:26 - this topic
199:28 - um i want to talk a little bit about the
199:30 - experience of trying to because a lot of
199:32 - people ask like oh i'm in india
199:34 - specifically trying to find freelance
199:37 - opportunities and i realize that's
199:39 - probably very different from the us
199:42 - in terms of like we have completely
199:43 - different types of businesses
199:45 - here in the us and lots of different
199:47 - opportunities are there any is let me
199:50 - just say is there any advice that you
199:52 - think specific to people in your country
199:55 - or your region uh might be really
199:56 - helpful
200:00 - for uh finding freelance
200:02 - customers uh and
200:04 - because
200:05 - i i'll just say that like a lot of
200:07 - people a lot of times i'll give people
200:09 - freelancing advice i'll be like oh well
200:10 - why don't you try talking to this and
200:11 - this and they'll be like well it's a
200:13 - little bit different in india we don't
200:15 - have that like
200:16 - uh i i realize this is a really really
200:18 - vague question but i'm just curious if
200:21 - there's some insight that i as as an
200:23 - american uh
200:25 - am missing out on that in the more
200:28 - global freelancing
200:30 - field might be like super actionable
200:33 - [Music]
200:41 - i think um
200:44 - it's something
200:45 - i mean i don't know if it's specific to
200:46 - the uk but i found um
200:49 - that
200:50 - kind of um
200:52 - approaching people
200:53 - face to face i mean i know we can't do
200:55 - that now but during the pandemic but
200:57 - just kind of all picking up the phone um
201:00 - that really helped kind of having that
201:01 - kind of one-to-one relationship
201:03 - um and i noticed that when um you know
201:07 - particular clients they kind of wanted
201:08 - you more local
201:10 - so uh they didn't want someone who was
201:12 - abroad they wanted someone local that
201:14 - they can sort of go to it's kind of like
201:16 - even though you can work remote they
201:17 - kind of wanted that safety net like you
201:19 - know we want to be able to you know
201:22 - call you or you can come to us and you
201:24 - know you can talk it out so it's kind of
201:27 - um i don't know if that's
201:29 - specific to the uk but i found that with
201:31 - clients they kind of it does help kind
201:33 - of being in that local area and having
201:35 - the option to to kind of get in touch
201:38 - with you when they can on their time
201:40 - zone and um or in person or on the phone
201:43 - it's just that kind of availability
201:44 - thing i don't know if it's if it's kind
201:46 - of a specific uk thing
201:49 - yeah and i find that too that of the new
201:52 - customers i get who aren't you know
201:54 - existing i mean i get them from all over
201:56 - but i do get a surprising number just
201:57 - from people that are looking for
201:59 - somebody in their local market
202:02 - the one thing i'll say
202:04 - wherever
202:05 - anybody is is
202:07 - yeah it try to approach people from a
202:10 - problem-solving standpoint i know i keep
202:11 - saying this over and over and i i don't
202:13 - mean to sound like a broken record
202:15 - um
202:16 - but like right now you know like here in
202:18 - the united states and here in dayton i
202:20 - think
202:20 - just about everywhere in the united
202:22 - states
202:23 - uh most restaurants for just as an
202:24 - example most restaurants can only do you
202:27 - know like carry out
202:28 - so instead of you know if you're gonna
202:30 - call let's say you're gonna cold call
202:32 - people
202:33 - instead of cold calling you know just
202:35 - random businesses
202:37 - you know the restaurants have a problem
202:39 - that needs solved you know they need
202:40 - people to be able to order food online
202:41 - and schedule a time to pick it up and
202:43 - things like that so
202:45 - instead of saying i'm gonna instead of
202:47 - taking the approach of
202:49 - i'm gonna look for work and i'm just
202:50 - gonna call every business in my
202:51 - neighborhood you know like let's say or
202:53 - something of the sort
202:55 - what i would say is identify a class of
202:56 - customers and under the example i just
202:58 - gave restaurants
203:00 - and you know then say here's a class of
203:02 - customers what problem are they having
203:05 - specifically right now
203:07 - especially right now with everything
203:08 - going on
203:09 - and when you call them
203:11 - you know you're not going to have to
203:12 - tell them they have a problem they know
203:13 - they have a problem and you know
203:16 - i think a lot of people would be
203:17 - surprised at how often
203:18 - they are pleased to be getting a call
203:21 - from somebody you know is reaching out
203:22 - with a problem-solving standpoint you've
203:24 - got an issue let me fix it for you and
203:27 - so i think whatever market you're in
203:29 - whether it's
203:30 - a state somewhere in the u.s whether
203:31 - it's a another country like india
203:33 - whether it's a place like the uk or just
203:36 - pick a place try to identify what kind
203:37 - of problems people in that market are
203:39 - having and present yourself as someone
203:41 - that's solving them and i really do
203:43 - think that's the biggest answer to the
203:44 - question
203:46 - and one of the things that you touched
203:47 - on there is because we're all trapped in
203:50 - our homes uh due to the pandemic and and
203:52 - doing the responsible thing in social
203:54 - distancing and in virtually every
203:55 - country i think in some places like
203:57 - south korea they've got the testing so
204:00 - on lockdown that they are able to
204:02 - release the lockdown
204:03 - that was really bad sorry
204:06 - um
204:07 - but what i wanted to
204:09 - ask is
204:11 - what are some strategies because you
204:12 - know there's of course email there's
204:13 - calling
204:14 - but what are some
204:16 - some ways that generally seem to work
204:18 - for contacting people virtually when you
204:20 - can't just walk into a bakery and and
204:22 - say like hey i've been using your bakery
204:25 - like buy something and then like use
204:26 - that as like a reciprocation technique
204:28 - or something like that by the way i can
204:30 - build this for you you know when you
204:31 - can't actually talk to people face to
204:33 - face and you have to rely on email
204:35 - communication or other modalities what
204:37 - are some tips are there any specific
204:39 - platforms that you found really helpful
204:41 - for
204:42 - finding clients anything like that
204:45 - i mean honestly i my first suggestion
204:47 - would be to just call people on the
204:48 - phone
204:50 - and and if you call and leave someone a
204:52 - voicemail or a message on their machine
204:54 - and you know say you're calling a local
204:56 - business and they don't call you back
204:58 - don't be shy about calling say over the
205:00 - course of a week or two don't be shy
205:01 - about calling two or three times now
205:03 - after a while if they don't call you
205:04 - back then obviously you stop calling
205:05 - them but
205:06 - don't be shy about you know call you
205:08 - know calling two or three times um
205:11 - getting someone on the phone is just a
205:12 - lot more personal than you know an email
205:14 - or
205:15 - something of the sort
205:17 - um so a i would say get people on the
205:20 - phone
205:21 - but also as soon as you get people on
205:24 - the phone
205:25 - you know uh pres i would say present it
205:27 - from their perspective um
205:30 - you know like let's say
205:31 - uh
205:32 - uh
205:33 - like i just built an app for a
205:35 - laundromat in
205:36 - my local area and uh what's a dry
205:39 - cleaning establishment and just because
205:42 - of the situation he doesn't want people
205:43 - coming up to the window you know he
205:45 - wants people you know scheduling stuff
205:47 - and so when i call him and uh talked to
205:50 - him about i know you you know you um i
205:52 - know you're preferring to just do
205:54 - scheduling like etc etc and i said let's
205:57 - build something so people can just
205:58 - schedule online with you okay um so for
206:02 - example if you're calling a restaurant
206:03 - you know presented as i would like to
206:06 - help your customers be able to order
206:07 - food from your restaurant online
206:10 - you know not i want to
206:12 - hire i want you to hire me to do
206:13 - something though presented as
206:16 - here's what i want to do to help you
206:18 - improve your business here's what i want
206:19 - to do to help your customers and i think
206:22 - that's just a in just my personal
206:25 - opinion i think that's a way better way
206:26 - to approach somebody
206:28 - versus um
206:30 - hi i'm a web developer um i'd like to
206:32 - talk about building something for you
206:34 - which says pay me some money whereas let
206:36 - me help your customers says let me help
206:38 - you make more money
206:40 - yeah and
206:41 - i guess you can always pitch it as like
206:43 - look you're gonna make a whole lot more
206:44 - money the money that you're ending up
206:46 - paying me will just be a drop in the
206:47 - bucket compared to the additional
206:49 - business you get uh so so like
206:52 - the benefit to them is going to
206:54 - completely offset any cost to them and
206:56 - and ideally there won't be any risk
206:58 - either
206:59 - right so
207:01 - um how about you phoebe do you have any
207:02 - tips for uh how you
207:05 - in the past to have you how did you find
207:07 - your clients and how that would be
207:09 - different today when we're all under
207:11 - lockdown
207:12 - um yeah i mean it's a hard one because
207:16 - um i did kind of rely more on the
207:18 - face-to-face and i think i built a lot
207:20 - of kind of clients through that medium
207:22 - but
207:22 - um you know i guess you can just
207:24 - transfer that to more kind of video
207:26 - conferencing um
207:28 - i mean like it's
207:30 - strange for the younger generation i
207:31 - find that they kind of prefer to be
207:32 - messaged you know kind of like whatsapp
207:35 - and things like that initially
207:37 - um so i i mean i would move it more to
207:39 - kind of having regular meetings but
207:41 - instead of face-to-face having the video
207:43 - conferencing using google meet or
207:45 - something like that
207:47 - um
207:48 - but yeah i mean like it's it's kind of
207:51 - in a way it's
207:52 - it's no different
207:54 - um
207:54 - you know you're just using a tool to
207:56 - talk to them
207:58 - but um i think
207:59 - uh if you are going to approach clients
208:02 - like what luke said i think it's you
208:04 - have to approach it the right way you
208:06 - you want to become across as the problem
208:08 - solver and i find that if you do your
208:10 - research on the business it really helps
208:13 - so then it looks like you've put the
208:15 - effort in so you know
208:17 - i always look at it to see if they've
208:18 - got an existing website how can i
208:20 - improve it and then you've kind of you
208:22 - know and usually they kind of appreciate
208:24 - that so kind of not just cold calling
208:26 - said hey i'm a web developer what do you
208:28 - need built you kind of say i've looked
208:30 - into your website i think you can
208:32 - improve this you can improve you know
208:33 - you look at the analytic you know the um
208:36 - you can look at the speed of the website
208:37 - if you can look at you know the
208:38 - accessibility you can go into
208:41 - uh
208:41 - the chrome dev tools and have a look um
208:44 - through lighthouse and you can sort of
208:45 - you know you can do things like that and
208:48 - then approach them so
208:50 - um but yeah i think it's just kind of
208:52 - getting your foot in the door um you
208:53 - know getting them to respond to you
208:55 - and you can and i would say be
208:57 - persistent email you know phone calls
209:01 - you know and and yeah and i say utilize
209:04 - your network as well
209:06 - awesome and balaji how have you found
209:08 - your freelance clients in the past and
209:10 - how would that be different now uh in
209:12 - light of the pandemic
209:14 - okay
209:15 - um so for me i i never really
209:18 - went out to look for clients at the
209:20 - early stages i
209:22 - much more got more referrals than me
209:24 - looking at clients and i never used
209:26 - emails because like emails doesn't work
209:27 - for me i only use emails when i have to
209:29 - like maybe um communicate like send
209:31 - files and all that like i think to go
209:34 - more personal with my clients like check
209:36 - them out and then we have video calls
209:38 - more often than normal and then we have
209:39 - phone calls because that way i can
209:41 - communicate more with them and
209:42 - understand
209:43 - their needs right so i do that a lot i
209:46 - call them and then we chat and then you
209:48 - get to understand okay this is what you
209:49 - want and um
209:51 - just what you need right and that's
209:52 - worked very very effectively for me and
209:55 - like one other thing i would say is
209:57 - trying to build up like your um your
209:58 - portfolio like your your appreciation
210:01 - because at the early stage um no clients
210:03 - will come up to you if they don't see
210:05 - something good enough you've done yeah
210:06 - it's like that's really strange like
210:08 - it's really rare for you to find out
210:10 - like while you're starting out you need
210:11 - to build more stuff because like you get
210:13 - more clients when they see you done more
210:15 - stuff because most often clients would
210:16 - reach out to you either from seeing um
210:18 - your work from somewhere else and then
210:20 - like reach out and like i want the same
210:22 - thing right so try as much as possible
210:24 - to like build up your portfolio like
210:25 - allow your clients to see one or two or
210:27 - three projects you've done that are
210:28 - really sexual and that way you can
210:30 - easily um
210:31 - communicate with them like it's not like
210:33 - saying i do this for this person and
210:35 - this is these are the results from um
210:37 - what i did and then here's what i can do
210:38 - for you also like i'm fully said like um
210:42 - reaching out to them by telling them you
210:44 - want to improve something from their
210:45 - already existing products is an
210:46 - effective way to like get them to use
210:48 - you i know i've reached out some clients
210:50 - and i'm like oh i checked out your
210:51 - website and then it's not really
210:52 - accessible and they're like what's
210:53 - accessibility like i now have an
210:55 - opportunity like to explain to them what
210:56 - it really means and then tell them why
210:58 - they're losing out and why they're
211:00 - losing some clients and then i tell them
211:02 - your images are so large or like your
211:03 - your website is not optimized and
211:05 - they're like what's all that and then i
211:06 - i break it down to them and let them
211:08 - understand why they need to optimize
211:09 - stuff and why their website needs to be
211:11 - accessible right so them understanding
211:13 - those concepts they're not like oh wow
211:15 - like i really didn't think about this
211:17 - right so they now have to like um go to
211:19 - the resources i sent to them when they
211:20 - say okay okay um i'm really interested
211:23 - in this and then how do we go about it
211:24 - it's like i've done two things now i
211:26 - educated them on why they should solve
211:28 - this problem and then
211:29 - i can now come in and say oh now i'm
211:31 - here to solve the problem for you so
211:33 - it's much more than just um
211:34 - using a product for them like it goes
211:36 - beyond just trying to understand the
211:38 - problem that comes from the existing
211:39 - project like luke said also when you
211:41 - understand um what problem they have
211:44 - already based on their existing project
211:45 - you can reach out to them and explain
211:46 - how they can improve it based on your
211:48 - own experience
211:50 - oh no
211:51 - go ahead luke can i add just one thing
211:53 - to all that i mean sure i completely
211:55 - agree if every in this more just of an
211:57 - ad to what everybody just said but
212:00 - the one thing i and to get back to it is
212:03 - in terms of getting business
212:05 - focus on your existing customers first
212:07 - and a lot of people may sound feel like
212:09 - oh i've only got this one customer i've
212:10 - got to go out and get some more
212:13 - and just to give a personal example
212:16 - call it
212:17 - 18 months ago
212:19 - i built an app for
212:21 - a realtor
212:22 - when she was out showing houses to her
212:26 - customers one of her customers uh
212:28 - like the user experience on that and he
212:31 - needed something she referred him to me
212:33 - i built something for him he has since
212:35 - referred me to more people
212:37 - so
212:38 - again that all came from that one
212:40 - project i got for
212:42 - the realtor so
212:43 - it's as crucial as it is to get new
212:46 - business and to how you sell yourself to
212:48 - people the best way to sell yourself to
212:50 - people is by doing a really good job for
212:52 - the people you're already working for
212:53 - that's just the most important part
212:56 - yeah i agree with that
212:58 - yeah i agree
213:01 - and that's an excellent takeaway to end
213:03 - our conference on everybody you heard
213:05 - that right from luke the best way to get
213:08 - new business is to focus on your
213:10 - existing customers dazzle them they will
213:12 - send more business your way
213:15 - definitely resonates with what i've
213:16 - heard and both phoebe and bolaji just
213:18 - agreed with that so
213:20 - uh i want to first of all i just want to
213:22 - thank uh phoebe

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone i'm quincy coming to you from dallas texas uh united states of america i am thrilled to be here to open lockdown conf and we have some amazing interviews uh some amazing panels with some really incredible developers from around the world today we are also going to be delving into four different topics that i think are very near and dear to all of our hearts these days continuing working from home effectively finding a job during this pandemic this unprecedented change in lifestyle for pretty much everybody around the world this is massive economic shock and finding opportunities and we're going to find that there are many many opportunities out there even in the tragedy uh the human tragedy in the chaos of this pandemic so first i would love to introduce fuzzil he is uh the cofounder of hashnote which is an amazing developer community where you can go you can configure your developer your dev blog you can have a blog running right on your website uh on your own domain you can set it up really quickly you can customize it it's really powerful tool and just so just check out hash note if you haven't i created the astronaut blog a while back i think it's amazing uh and then of course he's going to be with me the entire time coemptying fielding questions from the audience from both twitter and from our live chat as a spam counter measure and also to support the free cocaine nonprofit i'll just be completely candid about that uh we are limiting the chatting on the youtube video uh to people who are willing to become members on youtube uh i think it's it scales with which city you're in so if you're in india i think it's like the equivalent of two us dollars i think in the us it's closer to five dollars um i'm not sure what it is in other cities but those are the two prices i've heard um and this money goes to funding free code camp uh which is creating lots of free learning resources for people around the world so uh first i'd like to introduce angie jones she is a quality assurance engineer expert she's been doing this for a long time she is a developer evangelist at appletools and she's also the director of the test automation u learning resource i strongly recommend you check her out follow her on twitter her information should be in the description as with all the other uh panelists today in the description down below you can just scroll down you can just command click or control click open up all those awesome people on twitter follow them there i follow all of them they're all super interesting on twitter uh so thank you very much for joining us angie um next emma bostian coming to us from karlsruhe uh in germany i hope i pronounced that correctly thanks um she is a uh prolific developer and podcaster you may have heard the ladybug podcast uh i strongly recommend following her on twitter as well uh she is constantly doing exciting things and then of course dalwah shah uh the founder of classcentral.com which you may very well have used in the past month they've been growing very rapidly because they have indexed i don't know thousands maybe 100 000 reviews at this point of different free online courses and paid online courses like udemy courses and stuff it's a great place to find courses to figure out what how you want to learn what kind of resources you want to use which universities are putting out the best courses so it's a great way to just find the best courses to learn so welcome everybody thank you quincy it's a pleasure to cohost yes thank you yeah great to be here all right so first uh i think we should just open it up this is the topic of this first panel is learning the code during the pandemic uh during the in the age of social distancing i think the first thing that's going to be on pretty much everybody's mind is you know how should they best use in just general terms how should they best use this block of time that fate has handed them uh assuming that like activities that used to occupy a lot of their their free time are now just spent sitting at home uh how how should they best use that uh in your opinion and we'll go ahead and start with angie what are your thoughts on that yeah let me let me start off by saying that you know this is a trying time for everyone so um personally i've been you know having ups and downs as far as my moods and um the time this this time that we feel we have available some days it's not it's just a myth right um it feels like i have this extra time um but you know i have i still have my job to do um if you have kids at home that's additional work as well and if you're just not feeling up to it you're just not feeling up to it and i think that that's okay so i just want to preface anything i say with that all right for me i love learning new things i'm a teacher at heart as well so i'm trying to produce lots of content for people who are at home and want to level up during this time as far as my own learning my own uh productivity i i use my updates right so the days that i am feeling good and i'm feeling productive and i'm kind of tuning out the news or the days that i'm able to delve into all of the things that are out there there's so much content free code camp plenty of content there just all over the web there's all of these courses and things like that um that you can take a lot of them for free so that that's my recommendation like find what's the skill that you want to learn don't try to learn like all the things during this time but pick like one or two things that you would like to master during this time and find the resources to do so okay awesome thank you for that comprehensive insightful answer angie and and i just want to echo what angie said it's totally fine during this unprecedented time especially if you have family members who are sick or if you're concerned that you yourself have become sick uh with kavit 19 or or if you have other medical issues and you're just anxious about not being able to go to the hospital like normal or see a doctor like normal uh please don't make learning the number one priority like staying sane and just having a healthy lifestyle and having serenity those are the top priority and thank you very much for uh coming right out and saying that at the beginning angie because that's one thing i want to uh definitely emphasize everybody like you don't need to make personal sacrifices significant personal sacrifices i mean you may have to give up playing fortnite or watching netflix for a few hours but you but you shouldn't be giving up sleep you shouldn't be giving up uh prayer or meditation or however it is that you stay centered um emma uh what are your thoughts on prioritizing and figuring out what you want to learn during this period definitely i just want to reiterate what angie said because i believe that that is so vital right now is you can't learn new skills if you are not okay as a person so first and foremost take care of yourself um you know i've been struggling with motivation the past few weeks i was actually supposed to go visit my family for the first time in over a year and i had to cancel that trip so i won't see them for another year and so for me mentally that was really hard but i was also in the midst of preparing for technical interviews and so i had to balance studying and learning new skills with the emotional distress of living in a foreign country and being isolated from my family so it kind of all depends on your personal goals so if your goal is to look for a new job because many of us have been laid off which is very unfortunate kind of come up with a plan for yourself you know looking for a fulltime job is is a fulltime job so figure out what you need to learn and kind of chunk those into digestible pieces every single day don't overwork yourself but if your goal is to improve your skills and your day job or to learn something new find what you're passionate about or pick one skill to learn really really well this is the time to become tshaped so having you know vertical knowledge in one area but also branching out to new areas and just picking up tangential skills is really important and uh you know not to just be uh totally all about free code camp even though i'm a fan girl um i did use free code camp a lot the past several weeks and it landed me a new job a dream job so i personally would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their skills and web development okay thank you very much uh for the uh we're so thrilled to hear about uh your new job and and we're excited like of course whenever you get a new job you want to like focus on getting that but at some point we would love to have a writeup from you about your your path to getting that job and the decisions you made and how you did it along the way um absolutely thank you emma uh that wall so you have a really deep knowledge of this but maybe you want to say something about uh balance because i know you're very athletic and a lot of the things you enjoy doing you're not able to do at the moment yeah i usually love to play badminton and that's i've been doing remote for a few years now and badminton was my one contact with society so i tried to you know work out at home or in uh for a long time uh while working on class central uh badminton was the only thing that got me away from it so i think you should there are other things that you can learn which are not stressful which are not job related so you can also start learning just for fun so that it does so there is no pressure that you need to understand the material i would specifically recommend a course called learning how to learn which also sets you up for like other courses that will do in the future and it's also very entertaining and a light course that i took a few years ago and it's some of the techniques that i learned in that course applies to uh every day awesome yes uh barbara oakley she's an amazing uh university professor but also just teacher and she's very passionate about learning and that really comes through in that course and i believe that's the most popular course on that's the most popular mooc of all uh massive open online courses uh is it still i think it's one it's it's that one or it's andrew ing's machine learning course one of those two yeah and by the way just to reiterate if you ever wondered about massive open online courses like these free university courses you keep hearing about uh double is dare i say one of the world's foremost experts on this having run class central for how many years at this point seven eight years eight years eight and a half yeah eight and a half yeah so any questions anybody has about university courses this is a perfect time to ask them i'm just gonna very quickly read a couple comments uh from the chat uh uh catalan pitt uh uh said coming from someone who suffered from severe anxiety and burnout nothing is more precious than your health take care of yourself everyone and beth jackson said i love how angie and emma uh started with uh just giving us all permission to check in with ourselves and how we're feeling so there's uh i i've been gathering questions uh from both uh the hashtag lockdown conf and just monitoring the chat uh and if anybody asks the question that i'm like oh this is a great question i'm going to feel that uh i will i'll do so so be sure to ask in chat or tweet with the hashtag lockdowncomp uh but i'd like to know a little bit about time management so high management slash procrastination management uh let's start with you angie because i know you're uh precocious and you learn a whole lot and uh you're constantly learning new things um how do you manage your time and how do you keep yourself moving forward even without like some structure to impose upon you to force you to perform and learn new things yeah um it was really difficult for me for a while because i i am ambitious and i want to learn like all the things and do all the things and it was really difficult to keep up and i'm sure we've all been in a place where you start some tutorial and you never finish it or you start some side project and then it starts collecting dust i'm known on twitter for spanking people's hands when they buy new domain names that they're never going to use what i've learned to do is uh is form systems for example my goto is trello so i use trello to manage everything my work my side project my side projects my learning everything like i make cards for them and that was working for a little while and then it stopped working um and so i went a step further just to be a little bit more rigid and actually put like dates on all of the cards you know like at work and um you know here here's where i'm slotting out the dates some people also use their calendars in a similar way like okay let me block out this time for learning or whatever right um and so i'm i'm not that structured like i don't like oh at six o'clock i have to do x y and z um so i i do it in the form of days so today here are the five things i would like to do and i have that today column on my um trello board or whatever and so i kind of plan it i might take like a sunday or something and plan out my week um and that way i'm making sure i'm getting done the things that i want to get done including the things for my own professional development okay awesome it sounds very organized and a systematic approach procrastination yeah but there's one issue with that uh managing the trailer board is people often forget to revisit that board uh like once you move with your daytoday uh life uh you get you come across something which is more important than what you had actually planned so how do you manage those how do you try to stay uh in the same schedule that you had actually planned what's your trick angie yeah i live out of this board so i don't know about you all but in the world of so many distractions even before covet um you kind of just get sidetracked a lot like what am i supposed to be doing what was i working on you know um so i live out of this board so i never forget to come back to it because i forget what i'm supposed to be doing and so it's like oh let me go to my board oh yeah yeah this was the task that i needed to do next and you're right things do come up my boss might contact me like angie i need a blog post asap it's like that wasn't really on my list of things today so you kind of you know reprioritize and and although it sounds structured trust me i'm like very kind of fluid so um i don't mind like changing the date on something like okay well i guess i'm not gonna be able to um read emma's new blog post today let me put that for tomorrow or something great yeah and how about you emma what what approaches have you used um so i think my biggest um i'm taking notes because i don't want to forget this point i think it's really important so i'm going to start with the fact that i am definitely one of those people who like takes a ton of courses and like has to finish them i can't start one and not finish it like it's the same with reading books so i like waste a lot of time and i'll honestly taking courses that i don't need to be taking but in any case um i like to think about learning as kind of like from the financial world perspective i do a lot of learning about finances and how if you're going to buy something large think about how much time you have until you need to buy that thing and then kind of amortize that over every single day that you have until the deadline so if i have an interview coming up in two weeks what are all the things that i need to learn and let's amortize learning all of those things over every single day let's break it up into even pieces so you're not completely overwhelmed so i did that when i was studying for technical interviews but i never pushed myself so if i mentally was not in a place where i knew i could digest information i wouldn't i wouldn't learn uh it's just uh it's not practical to push yourself if you're not in a learning mind space um but that being said there's also this concept of intentional procrastination which is something that i practice so it's pushing tasks off um to a later time but in the in the back of your mind like your subconscious mind is putting pieces together um so if i have a big project like i won't start working on it right away because likely all of this that work i'm going to be doing is going to change over the course of a week so as opposed to doing all that work i'm actually just processing it in the back of my mind push off the tangible work until a later date and by that point i've kind of worked out the kinks in my head but there's a really great book called um uh why we sleep and it talks about how we form new connections when we're sleeping so make sure you're getting enough sleep it's more important than you think you can't actually build new not new memories but you can't build new synapses create new synapses in your brain to learn these new concepts if you're not sleeping enough so that's my my biggest tip right intentional practice procrastination did i get that right yeah that's definitely the term of the day for me because it seems like almost yeah it seems like a selfcontradictory term but that makes so much sense because you're right so much of the work is gonna is gonna change down the road thanks for sharing that with us and and just to be 100 clear the name of that book again why we sleep um why we sleep yeah there's another one called make it stick that i haven't read yet it's next up on my docket but it's about how different learning styles uh kind of work the the most efficiently with you and your preferred learning style so if i'd like to watch uh video tutorials that might actually not be the most efficient way for me to learn so i'd also recommend that one awesome uh thanks for the book recommendations just a pop quiz what time did everybody go to sleep last night in your local time zone 3 am no that hurts me i did 11 11 pm okay great so yeah [Laughter] i usually sleep at 4am so my goodness well to be fair everyone's like uh what are those called your cycles i'm losing my english uh everyone's circadian rhythms are different especially through ages but like i'm usually in bed by 10 not gonna lie that's great no it's great to hear both angie and emma are uh early sleeper or relatively early sleepers um yeah no i just knew i had to be here at the crack of dawn but you just so just for some context for everybody tuning in you may be wondering like if you're in california why is this conference so so early well we have lots of friends in in asia and uh and uh eastern europe uh we just wanted to make sure that especially down in australia oceanica like we wanted to make sure that they were able to to come as well and the the best time to do things generally it's like really early u.s time it kind of inconveniences americans but it's it makes it possible for everybody else to attend without having to stay up super duper late so uh thanks if you're one of those people who like woke up super early to watch this we appreciate it uh you're taking one for the entire global team and uh dawal let's talk about you like time management uh and managing procrastination what are some uh insights you've had on that yeah i mean i'm very similar to emma and uh what she talked about intentional procrastination uh or uh barbara oakley actually calls it like diffused mode of thinking so what are like some of these uh concepts are you see them across different productivity books so like learning how to learn is what taught me about a refuse mode of thinking and it made me comfortable with procrastination so i don't really do a lot of time management right now i just have a simple sublime text list which keeps growing and if it's not important i don't come back to it you know so and i try like i think my biggest step has been for me is not to feel guilty about procrastination so especially when you're creating something new it's you know i think procrastination is natural and yeah i usually sit on that let it sit in my head for a while and it's usually when you get to it you do it much faster i think it has such a negative connotation classically and i i would love to change that stigma i think it can be used as a tool if you use it properly right procrastination can be kind of a compass needle that shows you where you actually need to go because the one thing that you are procrastinating is probably the most important thing that you need to do right yeah i also really quickly i'm going to throw out one more book recommendation because it's great in terms of achieving your goals especially when you're trying to learn and that's atomic habits by james clear and i promote this book every chance i get because it's my favorite but essentially it talks about instead of setting goals just make sure you're on the right trajectory to achieving some sort of mindset but also change your mindset so like if you are trying to quit smoking for example identify as a nonsmoker as opposed to saying i don't smoke or i'm sorry as opposed to saying like oh i quit smoking so i'm not a smoker and changing your mindset and saying i am a full stack developer that will help you achieve these milestones and make sure you're on the right trajectory that that's great very practical advice uh just a very simple little mind hack that you can do to overcome imposter syndrome and one of our uh you know our prolific contributors and and community members over the years danny with gdg memphis was just asking i'm going to quote his question verbatim is very well phrased with the current times and with mental health being a big subject how do you deal with imposter syndrome and how do you deal with the doubts that you're facing especially during the lockdown and i'll just open that up to anybody who wants to jump in and has thoughts on that it's really long so i teach like an inspired workshop on like combating imposter syndrome i'll try to be very brief here um focus on the things that you know you know um imposter syndrome is something that people of all levels of success suffer with right um what really hit home for me is a quote um from maya angelou who is you know just profound and world renowned and uh she was like yeah i've written x number of books something like you know 19 books or something and every time i write the next one is when i think that the world is going to figure out i'm a fraud and it's like wow somebody who clearly is an expert um an inspiration to an entire generation feels that you know she's not good enough and she suffers with imposter syndrome as well so um it really just helped me like okay this is a thing it's a goofy thing and um and we gotta get over it right and so some i'll give you one trick that um i use with people who i know suffer with um imposter syndrome and it could be like um like just write down take maybe 30 seconds um give yourself 30 seconds to like two minutes and write down 10 things that you're good at right and that timer there is going to help you cheat the imposter syndrome because it doesn't have time to get in your head and talk to talk you out of it you're just writing it down quickly before you can second guess yourself and then at the end of that you look at that and reflect on it and it's like wow i have 10 things that i'm pretty good at that's that's really great you know um kick that imposter syndrome out yeah i love that i want to reiterate what you said about the fact that everyone regardless of where you are in your career how much money you make where you come from how many followers you have everyone experiences imposter syndrome and me personally i don't think i'll ever get over it people ask how do you get over it i don't think i ever will um but i don't know that that's a bad thing because it keeps me working hard um i will say try to recognize your small wins if you can recognize all these small things that you do that will compound over time you'll recognize how far you've come but i also kind of just want to challenge the question of like what is an expert like there's no definition of what exactly you have to have skill set wise to be considered an expert um and you don't need to be an expert to have valuable information so you know your your journey is unique and no one will ever walk that same journey as you which means you are viewing the world and your experiences through a different lens of someone else so your information and what you're teaching even if it's been done a thousand times if you want to teach react hooks um do it like absolutely because the way that you've learned it might resonate with someone else who was struggling with the concept so i would say you know recognize your small wins and just try to realize that everyone feels this way it's not just you can i piggyback on what emma said real quickly on um owning like your expertise and your your voice is so important um like emma said there's going to be dozens of blog posts tutorials or whatever on a certain topic and maybe you want to speak on that topic because you just learned about it and you want to write on like you know a hash note or something like that um and you're like oh well you know the the great expert has already written about it who am i to write about it let me tell you um when i'm learning trying to learn something and think about it from your own point of view you google whatever the topic is and you find like a bunch of results and you go to like one of them right and that one's not clicking for you so you go to the second one and then maybe you go to the third one um there's sometimes it's not until like the fifth or sixth one that i go to that is like okay this is speaking to me and how i learned this is great the other ones are in a different learning style are taught in a different style that doesn't resonate with me as well right so don't be afraid to put out content um that is already out there your voice and your approach is the differentiator so what other thoughts you all have as far as uh just using that confidence that you're getting uh these these same techniques that you're using to overcome imposter syndrome in terms of uh approaching the you know the meta of learning the code and going out and getting new developer jobs and working as a developer how would you use those same or similar techniques to learning a new topic for example it is very common for people to get stressed out about learning new mathematical concepts like if you wanted to learn linear algebra for example and you wanted to get uh it's a very commonly used uh form of mathematics and software development especially these days with like all the machine learning uh tools out there and and how would you yourself pump yourself up if you wanted to sit down and like i'm gonna learn some linear algebra this weekend what would your process be i think you need to find your why this is another book i could just open up you know a conference to talk about books find your why is start with why i'm sorry by simon sinek um he talks a lot about the reasoning behind why we do things if you can sit there and tell yourself i want to learn linear algebra because it will help me get a job at nasa i don't know maybe that's one of the requirements um as opposed to i need to learn this it's going to change your mindset um and it's i get to learn this right like i have the ability to learn this that's not something everyone get you know has the the privilege or the ability to do so for me it wasn't uh i have to study for technical interviews it was i get the opportunity to interview for an incredible job and that is my driving force great so um i would like to bring uh focus on like how do you measure success like you have talk uh you have spoken about how do you manage your tasks uh how do you pick books how do you pick resources how do you stay motivated but during this pandemic since a lot of things are happening at the same time you're hearing news from presidents you are hearing news uh breaking news from so many different areas how do you measure your success like how do you measure what you have learned and what you have not learned and because right now nobody is validating those things you are not attending interviews so how do you measure your success during this pandemic time i take small wins i'm going to focus on the learning piece of it um so starting a course yay me like i i am my biggest cheerleader right um and that helps fight imposter syndrome as well so yay me i started a course yay me i finished a chapter and you know i got a pretty good result on the quiz there um gay me i've actually finished this course you're going to hear about it on twitter yay i did it and then i take it a step further as well right because we all know that you can watch a tutorial but it's especially on coding but until you actually code yourself it's really hard to retain that information and so um then i want to go build something you know i'm going to take it a step further and it doesn't have to be a big huge app just something that's exercising what it is that i learned and yep i'm going to have to go back to that tutorial because some of the things i forgot i don't quite remember the syntax i don't beat myself up about that that's normal right we're i'm new to this um and that's okay forgive yourself yup that's why the resources are there keep consulting it right and it's not just one problem i might say okay now let me do another problem and after maybe two or three of those i'm not checking those resources as much anymore that's a win i count those small wins all day long absolutely yeah go ahead oh class central was a side project for me so it was the same thing i was trying to get better at php and i started it as a side project a onepage site to list all the courses from stanford and i just happened to be at the right place right time and for the first two years it was a side project and i kept adding new things just for the fun of it and i'm lucky now it's my job but i think finding a project finding some sort of thing that you're passionate about and then building something around it is is a good way to sort of implement what you're learning courses sometimes can give you a false sense of learning so trying to do something that's not following a script of a project or that somebody else gave it to you can be a good way to actually test yourself and figure out what you have not learned right right i um i just quickly wanted to mention a couple of things so for me success is success is subjective um but for me success is not a salary or a job title it's a mindset and i for me i realize i'm successful if i post a piece of content and it helps one person that makes me feel successful um but just to kind of visualize these things print out uh like a chart or whatever and you've got like different values on there and you every time you complete a course for example you color in a square or something so i do this when i'm paying off all my medical debt but i still have in the us like fill in hundred or thousand dollar increments right and every time you pay off a thousand dollars color it in you can apply that same thing to taking courses or um you know having successful github repos that aren't half alive like all of mine are i mean every time you take a course or you uh close a pull request like color it in and those visual reinforcements will help you stay motivated right awesome so visualizing your learning it like mapping it out uh do you all use any sort of tools to build like road maps of what you're going to learn or to how would you organize okay let me just ask a very openended highlevel question okay you decide that you need to that you've always been relatively weak in mathematics uh maybe you got through like the high school stuff and you kind of dodged or took the easier math courses in university the the easiest required ones uh you know or you didn't even go to university and like basically your math stopped it like high school geometry or trigonometry or something i mean if you're in the us i know in like china you would learn way more than that by the time you finished high school but um let's say that you want to go back and fill in the gaps how would you just using what you already know about learning lots of about qa or learning a whole lot about uh you know software engineering concepts uh learning new programming languages using what you know from your years and years of actually learning things new on your own and on the job how would you go about tackling that task how would you decide what to do let's just start from from day one you sit down you decide that you need to learn this new thing and we'll just say like you need to learn linear algebra since that's what i mentioned if you already know linear algebra don't worry about this maybe you can choose a different math this one and we'll go ahead and just start with uh we'll start with emma yeah so first of all i did terribly in math like i basically failed calculus if you're also bad at math it's fine i just want to throw that out there but um what i like to do is on one piece of printer paper i write down everything that's related i create almost like a graph structure where i'll start with the main topic i'm going to use data structures and algorithms because for me i can talk about that more freely so if i need to learn data structures and algorithms all right what data structures do i need break that down okay i need to learn things that are already built into javascript arrays objects sets things like that well what other things do i need to learn that aren't built into javascript linked lists uh you know hash tables i don't know whatever other ones stacks cues and kind of just create a little map of my for myself on one piece of paper and then based on those things what are the things i already am confident in color those in um and for the things that i need to work on what resources can i use to learn those and i create like a playlist i saw someone in the chat mention notion i use notion all day every day i also use the things app to create different lists like a to do application um and between those two i just kind of keep tabs on the on the different resources that i would like to watch to fill in those knowledge gaps okay awesome and how would you tackle that angie yeah i'll be honest like sometimes when i'm about to learn something new i'm not quite sure of um what's what am i supposed to be learning exactly right it's a new concept i just know let's say i'm going for a job or something and i need to know react right given that all i know is the word react i don't know anything about it i don't know i don't even know how to examine the courses that i could look at to see okay what does this course cover versus this course i don't know what i'm supposed to be looking for so in um situations like that i need to figure out like okay what's the best course for me what is it that i need to learn here and with that i seek out other people right um you don't have to do this all and figure it out on your own i'll give you a little tip though don't send people like generic questions of um hey i want to learn react where should i start right because that could be a really big answer and people if they don't know you might not take the time out to answer those types of things so try to be like very specific i need to learn react because i want to do x y and z maybe here are two or three courses that i'm considering do you have any opinions on you know which one of these would best get me to point b where i'm trying to get to right so that's a more specific question so figuring out like okay what is it that i even need to learn i'm finding that course again i have to block out the time otherwise the day gets away from me so i'll say okay i'm gonna take this course it says that this course is six hours long um okay where can i squeeze six hours in and i'm scheduling it out like maybe i only have 30 minutes or an hour that i can devote to something a day so okay let me make my little trello cards with 30 minute slots i can probably squeeze it in on monday and then again on thursday and then maybe you know tuesday or whatever so figure out and be realistic with yourself don't try to squeeze in more than you know you have time for um space it out if it takes you three weeks to get through six hour course that is okay you know you've done it you've gotten through it versus trying to do six hours and one day which is not that realistic for a lot of people yeah i just i wanna i wanna say plus one to everything angie just said 100 because like half the time i have no idea where to start and it's just a dumpster fire but secondly um don't memorize solutions understand the concepts and it's gonna take longer to do that but if you're interviewing for example um if you just memorize solutions but can't under don't understand that underlying foundations it's gonna be nearly impossible for you to explain this to an interviewer so be patient with yourself because understanding concepts takes a lot longer than memorizing but it will go a lot a long way awesome and i just want to highlight what jillian keenan said in chat uh she said i think a really good way to determine knowledge gaps is to ask yourself can you teach this to someone else maybe if you i mean there's always the rubber duck method if you're if you're social distancing completely by yourself but if you're with your partner or if you've got kids around you could try to teach them a little bit and and uh you know there's the saying i can't remember who said it but it was in my email blast that i sent last week it says teaching is learning twice um and you know you figure out the gaps in your own knowledge when you try to teach someone else i want to make sure we get an answer from daw although because i know he's just this is what he does he eats sleeps and breathes uh continuing education uh dal wall how many moocs have you completed by the way at this point you think probably a dozen not too many okay yeah but still i mean that's like the equivalent of like doing a graduate degree it's like 12 12 courses right uh but yeah how would you how would you tackle learning a big ambiguous new field of study i think i would try to find a starter course that allows me to put like five to ten hours and just making sure it's good enough and try to do a speed run through it basically understand like you don't have to understand everything but just to know what you don't know and i think that will help you understand then from there on it would help you plan out better i think we sometimes try to optimize things that we don't even know so i think just getting started as quickly as possible is something i would uh try to do instead of because you can go down the internet rabbit hole for of the best courses uh reddit comments you know like everywhere and then you might actually spend up more time finding a course then doing some sort of a short course that uh could take a few hours right right and uh i would like to bring focus on uh something that's uh happening in the internet right now that most of the companies like coursera and egghead they are opening up their courses they are giving the courses for free so what are your thoughts on that like do you think this is the right time for developers to grab this opportunity and learn as much as possible or should they focus on picking the right topic on these platforms and just completing few i think definitely picking the right topics um like places like free code camp always have free content i run test automation university we have free courses on programming and testing and all the things uh development um and yeah i think it's great that other platforms like pluralsight and things are opening up their content right now for free but i wouldn't recommend like oh let me start all the things right if you have 10 tutorials going the likelihood of you finishing them all is very small even the likelihood of finishing one probably goes down when you've started so many figure out what it is that you want to learn and i'm sure a lot of us have like backlists of things that we've always wanted to do and now maybe we have a little bit extra time and so it feels like we should probably tackle that entire list no think about like i don't know what are you most passionate about or what do you need right away for your current job or your next job or you know what's just something interesting that you would want to learn and maybe pick one and start that i don't know do any of you do like multiple tutorials in parallel i i personally have to do like one at a time yeah don't do it um i learned this the hard way um i your time and your willpower are depletable resources so you need to use them efficiently and effectively and i'm the kind of person that has shiny object syndrome like i see a tutorial i want to take it and i start it but what that means is i'm actually learning the skills that are relevant to me right now so um i would definitely recommend sticking with one because human beings like to think we can multitask but we can't great yeah i mean i would agree to trying to i that's why i usually prefer like full courses which are like almost a month long or something so once you start something you don't have to think too much in terms of finding resources you just do one single curriculum it's like what it's one storyline so hopefully it's coherent so you're building on top of the knowledge week after week and that's why you generally have a preference for university courses uh if i can jump in and just say like the reason free cocamp is a single linear curriculum is precisely to avoid what angie and emma are talking about shiny object syndrome historically universities just had a single major everybody just studied liberal arts and that was like you learn greek and you learn latin you learn math and you learn all these different topics but everybody learned the exact same thing and everybody in the world who went to college essentially learned the same general body of knowledge and we've gotten away from that with like all these different electives and it makes sense if you're like learning nursing that you shouldn't have to necessarily learn um you know i'm i'm trying to think of a good a good analogy here but but you wouldn't necessarily need to learn uh a lot of different skills if you were going to become a super specialist but i would argue that we should have a more generalistic uh you know university experience and then people can specialize on the job but anyway to to try to blunt the uh the power of shiny into object syndrome of grabbing your attention pulling you away from what you need to do and ultimately serving as a tool for procrastination we decided very early that free cooking would have a single linear curriculum and people would work from the top to the bottom and there wouldn't be a bunch of forks in the road uh because generally when your university is asking you to choose electives they're they're basically asking you to make a decision in a relatively uninformed way um yeah i like that free code camp is linear but it's kind of like a la carte in a sense because you can start anywhere you don't have to start at the beginning um which is really invaluable like you have a clear path but you don't have to follow that path if you don't fit into it yeah and i i don't want to talk too much about free code camp on this because there's no way you're here like everybody watching wants to hear from you all but i will say like it's highly informed from like video game design and i think the future of education you can see it in video games uh that that it's not only fun but it's almost addictive if we can make learning addictive then we've truly won and uh we're truly gonna have like a really uh enlightened uh populist so we still have about six minutes five and a half minutes left uh fuzzil do you did you have any closing questions that you wanted to ask to the panel yeah i'm just going through the twitter feed and uh someone uh recently asked one question uh which is like really interesting and something we keep on seeing on astronaut every time which is like uh oh my god uh like how do you uh overcome uh the um that someone else is doing better than you uh has learned something really good and has created a really popular open source project and i am some and i am somebody who is lagging behind so again like as emma has spoken about the selfmotivation so what tips do you have for beginners who are feeling this way i always tell people beginners experts anybody there's a philosophy i follow where i think about it as running a race right and when i'm running my race i'm looking ahead and focusing on my own path and yeah i might glance over to other people who are running but my focus is on my race right and if you stare too hard at other people think about the momentum that you're losing because you're not focused ahead and that's true in life if you're so focused on everyone else's journey that's time and energy and momentum and selfconfidence that you're losing focus on your own race everyone has different circumstances right i'm at home i don't have kids my job is very flexible so i probably can do more than someone else who has five children at home and a partner who is sick and you know their fever is running high and you know it's just a lot of different circumstances don't focus on other people's journey you don't really know their story you don't know how many times that they've fallen down this might be their third attempt at the thing that this is your first attempt at right and maybe that's why they're moving a little faster it could be a million different reasons don't focus on it because you're losing momentum in your own race focus on your race i also think too this is an important message which is computers are binary but humans aren't and so you're and you mentioned your journey is not going to have feature parody with another person so focus on who you were are today and compare that to who you were yesterday right right so here's a tip for all the big nerd developers don't get intimidated by someone else's success focus on your own journey yeah yeah i know i know i don't want to monopolize this but someone else's success does not take away from your success so you know unless you're applying for the same job but don't compare yourself to anyone else um focus on yourself and be genuinely happy for others who are doing well because again it doesn't impact your success right yeah i think so many people get in this kind of scarcity mindset where they're like feeling like they're competing with other people that are their peers but the reality is you know the world is a big place i mean we can't even fathom seven billion people like our brains can't capacitate those like that scale of numbers and uh you know nobody understands how everything works nobody understands how the market works how different companies are able to bring in revenue and survive it's a complex ecosystem and uh within all that ambiguity you can be assured that there is a tremendous amount of opportunity uh i mean we've somehow managed for most of modern human history to keep a bulk of people employed after this pandemic passes there are going to be new opportunities out there and you're not going to be competing headtohead with people around you in some abstract way you'll be competing in the sense that the more entrants into a field potentially you know the the more uh supply and demand uh demand uh is met and price goes down as a result but that's only going to have a very small marginal impact on you in practice all these people that are here in this chat room with you that are watching this video with you they're your allies and you have so much more to gain from collaborating with them than you have to lose from them also succeeding i mean it it really is true like other people's success is your success and celebrating other people's success is a great way to build rapport with them because that's the moment that they really are proud of and that they want other people to jump in uh any closing thoughts before we end this panel just there have been so many great things that you all have said focus on your own race your own journey is something angie said and just a minute ago emma said your journey is not going to have feature parity with another person great great use of uh software uh analogy there all right well we are going to uh i just want to thank everyone for joining we're going to take a five to ten minute break there are going to be slides playing there's going to be music from bass rebels which is this great youtube channel with with copyright free music that we can listen to uh while and jam out and just chat uh tweet questions for the next panel the next panel is going to be um how to work successfully from home without going crazy and i just want to thank our phenomenal guests for everything that they brought to the table here and that they've shared with us angie uh jones up in san francisco uh be sure to scroll down in the description there again there are links to everybody's twitter you should absolutely follow emma you should absolutely follow angie and dal wall uh of course uh emma thank you for joining us from germany congratulations on your dream job we're all excited you know a few weeks after you've settled in maybe months after you this is what you're going to be doing you're going to be learning all the different uh tacit knowledge associated with working at that company so that's what you're probably going to be doing but once that slows down and you have time we'd love for a check in on the free code camp publication you got it and then daw all thank you again for everything you are doing with class central you're taking all these huge you know this huge volume of free online courses and you're making it uh searchable and you're giving people qualitative feedback on you know like you can read the anecdotes from somebody who actually went through the course what they thought of the course and then you can see like it's just like amazon like you know the star review system so you can find the best courses for different topics and of course dawa also frequently publishes lists of the best courses based on data so thank you uh everyone for joining fazel and i will be right back in about five minutes with a new panel thank you thank you for your time it was nice talking to you all bye thanks for having me bye bye bye everyone have a beautiful day hey everybody welcome back uh i'm quincy larson with free code camp uh of course joined by my uh comc puzzle with uh hashnow.com and hey guys hey um and we this panel is about how to work productively from home and stay sane and we're going to be talking with three people who probably have a combined total of at least a decade or two of working from home uh tons of wisdom here if you're just starting working from home this is the panel for you you're gonna learn all the little tricks and hacks that these people have picked up over the years uh so i'm gonna go ahead and i'm thrilled to introduce you to our guests these are prominent developers from the community uh many of whom uh i've interviewed on the free cocaine podcast where we publish like videos of their workflows and things like that so i'll start with uh colleen schneidel schnetler and and she is a freelance developer in the arlington virginia area she has three kids and she manages to work from home while her three kids are not like barging in and completely disrupting her all day which is quite an accomplishment uh we also have jessica chan from the austin area in texas um and jessica is the coder coder you may have heard of her or checked out her in incredible instagram which is just filled with programming tips and it's just it's one of my favorite instagrams i strongly recommend you all check it out and uh and then of course we have sid who's in uh he's in amsterdam and he works for code sandbox which you may have heard of it's a new relatively new coding playground where you can go and build projects right in the browser he was previously at off zero again both jessica and sid have extensive experience working remotely as well so uh welcome thank you yeah so uh just just to start off like what has changed over the past month and a half for each of you maybe you could describe how the pandemic is affecting your your daytoday life and and we can we can start with uh jessica sure well i have been working remotely for maybe the past four years or so so it's kind of weird because on a daytoday basis even before this all happened i wasn't really i didn't have like a huge active you know life outside the house i would you know stay indoors do my work and so day to day a lot of things have stayed really the same but obviously i think just knowing what's going on in the world right now and you know not being able to say visit family and friends in person that's definitely been a huge change and just kind of moving from inperson meetups with friends to you know house party or you know different hangouts with friends instead so it's just kind of moving into the online virtual space like we're doing now awesome uh and how about you colleen so our lives have been completely upended because of the the children are no longer going to school and in the state of virginia they have cancelled school for the rest of the school year so it's been a month now my kids are three six and eight and none of them are um in school we don't have any child care options so it's i mean it's been really hard i've got to be honest like it has been okay i have a second grader so he should probably learn something the kindergartner and the threeyearold like they'll be okay um so trying to balance like this homeschooling which i am not a teacher um i've challenged i've been very it's been very challenging bad and like still finding the time for work yeah i can only imagine i i have two kids and it's it's crazy enough but yeah again they're they're not schoolaged so we don't have to really worry about teaching them um and sid how about you how how's uh calvin 19 impacted your daytoday life out there in amsterdam so i'm closer to jessica on this one that on the surface it's kind of the same like i was working remotely the whole team works remotely but i want to say that it doesn't feel like the usual at all like it feels very very weird um at home there's been like some tiny changes we have to make because my wife also works at home now so with like this this is the meeting room and the dining table is the coworking space so it's like we can't have like we can't sit at the same place and have meetings at the same time so we're like constantly booking the conference room uh but other than that it just it feels weird but like it's my life overall probably hasn't been impacted as much right i don't know about you guys but do you feel like like i feel like just the stress of the whole situation has really impacted my ability to focus too so there's been kind of third order effects like checking the news and seeing what's going on and then trying to work definitely right right yeah i've had to push myself back from keeping up to date on the news because it was kind of getting a little too much and just affecting your mental state right right so as you know like there are a lot of companies who had never heard about work from home concept so this is like the first time they are introduced to and i keep getting complaints from my colleagues my friends and they are saying like none of the work is happening is actually happening so things that were supposed to take one day of time it's like they're taking seven days of time to finish so what advice do you have for developers who are introduced to work from home environment for the first time so yeah i said you can go ahead first i can start i kind of feel bad for them because this isn't remote this is like this is not how remote jobs usually are so they've kind of been thrown into this without preparation without being set up for this so i'm feeling like and to be honest it's not just them even remote teams like mine are probably working at like 50 percent productivity right right now so i'd say that's just kind of the way it is right now because of like the stress and like it's just hard to focus and get things done right um we can talk about tips soon but i just want to like start by saying like it it would be harsh to like force productivity on anyone at this time and what's been really useful in our team is just kind of having that conversation where like i have a lot of guilt about not being productive because that's something i struggled with anyways so just having that conversation in the team has been has been kind of like comforting because i realize nobody is at their best right now so people are more forgiving than you would imagine right right yeah i do think it comes down a lot to just your company culture and how maybe empathetic or sympathetic your manager as well as the higher ups your company can be so i think you know this unfortunately might be one of your these your miles your mileage may vary situations um you know if your company is really understanding and they they know that you know there's parents having to homeschool their kids and there's more understanding in terms of having expectations but it can be difficult if you're working for a company or a manager who's expecting you know the same or maybe even a higher amount of productivity out of you at this current time which is just not really possible i just wanted to um just kind of like this is a great panel but i just want to come out and acknowledge the fact that we're all five developers like everybody here on this call we're five people who can work from home and i think it it we should it it requires saying that we are extremely fortunate in this regard many many people uh cannot work remotely like many people have to go and deliver packages or they have to work in a logistics center or they have to work in a hospital to help people who are sick many many things do require physically reporting to a specific location at a specific time and there is a tremendous amount of risk associated with that and so i just want to make sure everybody watching realizes that we do feel grateful for that reality and and that uh i i don't want anybody to get the impression that we're you know a bunch of entitled developers talking about how our our productivity's gone down 30 or something like that when people are out there like subjecting themselves to incredible risks uh them and their families uh so um this should not be a dour panel because we should be extremely happy i'm extremely grateful like i i look at like what i was doing before i was running a school i was a school director before i learned to code and became a developer and i had students from all over the world and they would fly in and help with their their visa paperwork and help with you know just monitor the the teaching staff and we had inperson instruction and i think about how that would have completely turned my life upside down like i was working like 50 60 hours a week just making sure all my teachers were happy all instruction all the admin staff were happy have you all worked in fields other than software development where working remotely would not be possible and how do you envision the difference between what life is like right now for you as a developer and what life would be like if you stayed in your old field um so i used to work uh in defense and that was a job where we had to go into the office because of the things we did and you know it's interesting you brought this up because i was just saying to my friend the other day i was saying like i hate to complain at all about the situation because our situation is better than 90 of the people in the world right now um just because of everything you said like i'm so lucky that i made this transition i mean at my old job like i assume we would have lost our jobs like they can't pay you if you know if you can't go to work um and just just even now like because i'm a consultant contractor um i don't know if i'm gonna have a job in three months like i don't know if our current contract our contract was supposed to be renewed but now we're waiting so we don't really know what's gonna happen happen and that's stressful but my partner also works so between we are so we have that safety net of a dual income household but i have so many friends who are independent consultants and contractors where they have one spouse that stays home with the kids and one spouse that works and that anxiety and that stress of like am i gonna have a job in three months like i have to support this family like feed these kids is it can be i mean i just feel like it can be overwhelming yeah i can i can relate to that a little so my first job was in the environmental physics setup so my job is literally to go fill in tests there's a stuff on it to see like how much like co2 in the atmosphere and all of that this was before like i decided that i don't want to do physics anymore uh but what's interesting is like i can't imagine doing that right now because it's like it we needed like these giant instruments that were only there in lab it's like you you just can't have that anymore and like being the most junior person over there i'm pretty sure i'm the first one that would lose the job right if the labs like labs work on like funding and they have to publish research and in time like this there is no research happening like you can't publish anything so if funding gets cut it's it's the it's the people who put the test tubes that lose the job first yeah i used to work in higher ed in just doing like administrative uh office type work and i'd imagine as you know many schools are either closing closed or trying to go online like my job probably would have been eliminated at some point or would be kind of on the edge so yeah definitely feel very fortunate and it's a tough situation for a lot of people in terms of their their work situation yeah and i i know that many people watching this many of your jobs may have evaporated and i just want to emphasize that we uh we want to do everything we can to help you find a new opportunity and i'm hopeful that this uh this conference that we're doing will be helpful in that regard um somebody in in chat uh just said he was laid off two weeks ago uh but that the benefit of being a developer is that he can take an idea or a problem and he can build something that could potentially replace that income so let's talk about work from home tools because that's a huge area of interest right now in terms of like like if you look at the companies that are hiring right now many of them like focus on remote productivity like microsoft teams or slack or zoom or some of these tools what is your work from home tool chain like and and how do you stay productive and work with your colleagues remotely what are the main the main tools you all use well my uh my workpiece is slack for everything so everyone's on slack even before this all happened i think they were they have offices in different parts of the world so they had already kind of had this system set up where everyone can communicate pretty well and everyone sort of knows how to you know do project management and other things um on online which has been pretty great so i think yeah some chat tool whether that's slack or discord or you know maybe even google hangouts i think is super helpful yeah and how about you sid what are you using over at code sandbox um so i guess slack is the common one view is zoom and we've recently gone through a bunch of pair programming apps because everyone that we used was having scaling problems so like our default choices kind of went went away but we've like settled on tuple.app which i think is new to maybe it's not as popular so it's working great for us that plus zoom plus notion it's i i feel like it's mostly communication tools and we're doing a lot of asynchronous communication these days like a bunch of writing more than they've ever done i think this has just made us like better at being remote than we were already interesting so just just to highlight what you just said there working remotely is is kind of increase everybody's average level of communication skills you'd say i mean we we were already remote so we had to communicate a bunch but then you always had the option that you know you could ping someone and you could say let's let's chart it this time or let's get on the zoom call right but even though we're like relatively close by like i think everyone in the team is in europe they're kind of working different time zones because somebody has a kid and then they have to you know sometimes they have to take the morning while their partner takes the evening so it's like everyone's schedule has kind of been just thrown off so now it's most of the conversations are asynchronous and i think we've gotten into a good habit of documenting and just like passing on thoughts processing them and then sharing them otherwise we would just like get on a zoom call and treat it like a tap on the shoulder yeah and how about you colleen what kind of tools are you all using so my teams use slack and zoom and whereby and google hangouts if we're feeling lazy um so just just those kind of communication tools i think because i this one team i'm working with um i i agree that this has actually helped us become more communicative which i think has been great for our team we're more likely to kind of jump on a screen share than we were before this happened which i'm not exactly sure why um but but that yeah so that's worked pretty well for us okay awesome it sounds like somebody might be washing dishes in the background uh if if your partner's washing dishes please mute um so uh one question we have from uh uh chat that i really want to highlight elliot sanford uh long time freako camp uh remember i think he's at a coding bootcamp right now too um elliott says how are you able to cope with being a parent and spouse but also able to learn and work from home and what do you do to keep work from taking over i'm struggling here so balancing familial obligations with um just uh work in general and the diffuse nature of working from home i should say yeah i i mean we i'm i'm struggling with this right because usually my kids are in school um and so it's been a month we've been on lockdown here for a month and at first i tried to like set the kids up with their work and work on my laptop by then but i found that my children are i guess too young they need more focused attention so for me it's really about managing my expectations so part of the reason i'm a contractor so i have free time to work on side projects as you mentioned earlier quincy someone said he got laid off and he was going to start building something that's amazing and that's what i do for fun and i have just accepted the fact that until we're out of lockdown like i just cannot do it i just don't have time like i will lose my sanity if i do it i mean you know i have to let some do you just have to let something go i think and so what we do here is i take the kids except for today of course i usually take the kids from 6 a.m to 1 p.m and then my partner takes them in the afternoon and then i supplement work in the night you know after hours um as needed but but it's hard and i think you know we don't know how long this is going to go on for so i think it's it's really important to although you have to work nights to probably meet your deadlines and continue your learning like don't burn yourself out um try to remember to take breaks try to like block i think it's about expectation management too like if you're gonna do kids from six to one like block out that time for them and just accept you're not gonna get any work done during that time but i mean i don't have a great solution like i think you know i'm just figuring it out yeah how about you jessica inter i know like how are you coping with the balance the worklife balance when work and life are happening in the same space yeah i mean my husband and i don't have kids so i think that's one i think big difference from my situation but i do know that when i first moved from working in a physical office to working remotely that was like a huge transition and it honestly not to like scare people it probably took me a year before i felt like comfortable and productive i was just like supe i felt very unproductive um and i felt like during work hours i would be distracted and i wouldn't really be able to focus on my work but then i would have to catch up on my work during the evening time when i should be sort of relaxing and getting ready for the next day so and kind of what colleen was saying in terms of time blocking is you know even if it's not nine to five hours try to when you're working be 100 working as much as possible of course and then when you're not working try not to let work sort of creep in but even if you're catching up on your work you know in the evening times i think you can still at least try to whatever current task you're doing sort of try to stay focused on that as much as you as much as possible yeah i can relate to that so um i had to learn the same way like when i started working i was either totally unproductive or i was working all the time i kind of like juggled between the two before i found a balance and what's been interesting is that like last month when i when my wife started working from home all of that balance kind of went out the window and we had to discover it all over again and i saw her working all the time and i was like what do i do so i also like the options were look at twitter look at the news or lose yourself and work so i think the first three weeks we just worked like all day all night but recently like with finally like it took three weeks to adjust but i think we've found a balance where uh we have a few things to work like we have certain workers and then we also know when to call it a day and that's the funny thing with remote like you don't see people walking out of the office or you don't like nobody tells you that it's time so you kind of just have to set a boundary for yourself and if you're in the floor if you're dealing with like a bug that you just can't fix and you want to get it done sometimes you just have to say it's 6 p.m i did what i could do today i'm gonna try again tomorrow and one thing that has really helped with this which which is new to me like i i did not do this earlier but it's new now because i found these escapes right and it can be like a productive escape like a side project so i've started working on a side project i'm super efficient with that now or it could be something which is not so productive like playing animal crossing right but just having something to look forward to in the evening like when you say like people talk about blocking time for work i started blocking time for not work so like three hours in the evening i'm either gonna work on my side project or play video game and because i'm looking forward to that i'm more motivated to finish my work during the day so that we can you know do stuff do something in the evening like we've been so many shows on netflix and it's it's fine like that's what helps the rest get done exactly my pet is super happy right now i'm spending more time with my cat taking her to walk so it's like no lockdown for her but it's locked down for me so yeah uh developers uh need to uh utilize this time that they have got uh and then they make best use of it and also balance it out between work and the home life right yeah and let's talk about time and the temporality of working from home because a lot of if you're no longer in an office you're no longer like how many of your meetings are synchronous where you're all talking like at the same time uh where you have like a scheduled meeting like what percentage of your day would you say is is actually has to be a tackled at a specific time versus like just an openended block of time that you could potentially shift to nighttime when your kids are asleep for example uh or other times like uh yeah we'll start with you uh colleen like what percentage of your day is strictly regimented to specific times um very little in terms of my work like we have um you know so most of my coworkers on for this team i'm on now on the west coast um so i prefer to you know kind of it works better for me to work later hours but we're completely asynchronous with slack so um i'm totally flexible there okay and how about you um jessica most yeah most of the communication with my team is probably asynchronous as well but there are i do have a few meetings per week where we try to be it has to be everybody at the same time but we're in relatively all the same time zones so it's not too much of a problem yeah and instead with uh yeah i mean how big is the code sandbox team because i talked to the founder of code sandbox like a year or two ago and it's grown so much yeah i mean i mean so much is relative i think when you talked with four people now it's nine but it's still a pretty tiny team uh what's been interesting is that we do the we do a daily stand up every day i've done it since the start and it's one of those like it's super optional oh i love this this reminds me of the famous kid walking sorry i knew this was to happen that we just moved into a new place and that door doesn't lie did you find this hang on it's very appropriate this is what we're all living with right now okay this is real life yep okay he's gonna hang out he's not gonna touch the keyboard or anything um he'll just be here for a few minutes until he's bored okay so um sorry for the interruption i i anticipated that might happen my wife has been kind of like on standby to prevent that but the kids are very wily it's very welcome i've met like my in my team i've met all the kids all the pets like this is like if a cat comes crawling here you just let it be it's fine this is part of the part of your team now yeah yes i was talking about the standup so we decided a long back like a while back they do a daily stand up and it wasn't so much to sync up on work it was mostly to see each other's faces and now more than ever that's been really useful that i think we've increased our meetings now because it just kind of helps to pair on something like we had so many meetings where we just spare even if it's like anyone can solve the problem we would just pair to do it together because it's like a it's like a reminder that we work together and honestly it's kind of nice to fade into like api details and not worry about like the looming thing in the background of your head yeah and we have a question from the chat for you sid uh uh leonardo uh gallante is asking uh what is the pair programming tool that you all use currently um so we use code sandbox uh paired with tuple tuple okay cool and code sandbox of course i think does it support uh multiple people editing uh a sandbox at the same time yeah you can invite someone and then do the dual cursor thingy yeah yeah so your whole team remote okay i mean there are three people in amsterdam but then right yeah so you're able to dog food your own product dog fooding being like you eat your own dog food you're able to use code sandbox to work on code sandbox yep yep that's somewhere it gets hard sometimes yeah all right so what advice do you have for companies who are trying to get used to this work from home environment so as said you have spoken about standups so how can companies effectively do standups should it be like 15 minutes 45 minutes one hour two hours because i have heard companies staying online and coding live so is that the right thing or what is the right thing here i i can start so yeah i don't think there's any right or wrong per se right like i think like standups are great to just get everyone in the room uh where standups i've seen gone wrong is where you just start trying to solve problems in the standup itself right right it's nice to just catch up with everyone which for us with like super tiny so it takes 10 minutes but like depending on how many people in the room you can go on for like 20 25 minutes uh but then what's useful is that you don't try to do things there and instead break out into different rooms so a lot of times our standups end with somebody saying somebody asking the other person to stay back because they have a question for them and everyone else just says buys and goes away and the two people stay on for the call for longer yes how about you jessica um yeah i mean i think this is one of those questions where the the correct answer is it depends but you know i think um yeah i think just trying to effectively and efficiently run your meetings whether they're in person or online is really important because you know if you have a giant zoom call with like 25 people i think you may not be able to be as productive as you could if you you know um split up into different rooms and also maybe being mindful of the the amount of bandwidth that's available for zoom worldwide and other places so yeah yeah and colleen did you have anything you wanted to add on this oh right i believe in over communication in this situation um now our team has always been remote but like i i liked i love sid actually i love the idea of a daily 10minute stand up because i'm an extrovert and like i've been in this house for four weeks so i'm like talk to me someone talk to me um so i love that but uh we're trying to move towards more towards a more communicative model because we've just i mean we also have a really small team and the code base is small so we're like stepping on each other's toes sometimes if we don't communicate enough um so i just think it's a situation where you over communicate i love the daily standup idea i'm gonna suggest that to the guys i work with and um you know the the slack messages and just just a lot of communication because you're not there you can't go look over someone's shoulder and be like oh you're working on this i'm working on the same thing well that's you know project management so so how frequently do you think companies should uh discuss um their updates with the developers like in a day like is stand up the only thing like calling like how what process do you follow in your company like do they meet multiple times in a day or do they meet twice like in the in the morning or and once in the by the end of the day so we don't do daily meetings um we just do all our communication on trello and slack and a call like if necessary um but i like i said i would actually i'm actually going to push to do a little bit more because i think it's hard to manage you know you guys know like you have github issues you got trello issues you got jira who knows where interests are so i i think it's better i mean i think like maybe even a daily like we don't have um someone that is just a program manager so everyone manages their own issues and so we only have we have maybe like priority issues once a week where we get together and talk about like is the priority still the same coming from the customer um so that's kind of what we've been doing great yeah and as far as uh like physical space so i know you all are working from home uh in some cities people are fortunate enough to be able to have like multiroom setups i used to live in san francisco and we lived in a uh and like maybe 700 square feet with uh with the two with the little baby and it was uh i can only imagine what it's like to be going through that sort of situation right now during the pandemic hit the pandemic just had the dice rolled differently in the pandemic hit when i was still living in there my life would be very different from being in kind of a texas standard issue house but uh but for those of you who do have you know more than one room or different spaces around the house do you delegate a specific room for like okay i'm in work mode now uh and how do you go about deciding which space you use for what and do you have any hard and fast rules that you apply for that sure yeah i mean i i also am fortunate to live in a relatively low cost of living part of the country and so i do have a dedicated office which i'm extremely fortunate to have so yeah as much as possible i try to limit myself you know in the physical space to just do work in the office so like i'll i'll never do work on my couch or my bed of course part of that's probably because i have an external monitor that i'm completely addicted to but you know i think i think it is important to you know if you're working from home keep have a dedicated area even if it's just like your dining table um during certain parts of the day dedicated to work yeah that that's been interesting so like this room is was used to be my office and i've i'm the same like i've been lucky enough that i was already set up for this so i didn't have to change much what's different is that now this is also my wife's office right so then we have to take turns so now the dining table has kind of become the other office and the couch in this room has become where we have dinner right so it kind of had to repurpose the house because it's either the dining table or the bed and i know i'm not gonna get anything done from the bed like the dining table is the office desk now and the couch is where we have our dinner so you have to like change it up a little but i think like just just defining those spaces was really helpful um because it takes a while like it took us two weeks but now we're now i sit on the dining table and i know it's the place where i work and not where i eat food so that helps me get into the zone as well right so one question uh that somebody has asked me on twitter is what do you think that companies are uh actually cautious about their ip being late uh their ideas being leaked because as cdo said like you and your wife are working in two different companies and uh so the projects that you are working on so how do how do how should developers manage this like how can they take care of this thing because sometimes companies are very cautious about their ideas their projects that they are currently working on should not be linked to others so what do you have to say about that are they concerned about leaking by like someone talking to their friend about the project or is it more like a security like a hack type i i don't know just the idea being discussed with someone else or a person from another company yeah so i guess a lot of discussions might have previously taken place in secure rooms especially like you know colleen mentioned she was in defense and i imagine they have all kinds of additional layers of security there but uh if if you're at home there could be like an alexa unit that's just passively listening and we don't know like whether that is actually being transcribed somewhere same thing with like people's phones and stuff like all the traditional security when you're on a meeting you know things could be said that uh could be recorded somewhere else or people could hear about or if you and your spouse are in the same industry then you know competitive information might inadvertently be shared that uh you know so i guess i'm not sure if this affects any of you all but uh d do your companies have any sort of policies or are they even thinking about these things at this point i imagine there are lots of other things they're thinking about i mean i i guess it's brave to assume that my wife already doesn't know everything about my work [Laughter] like being at home it doesn't really give an advantage but i do understand where the question is coming from so like uh before this like a long time ago i used to work for a healthcare startup and there were a bunch of rules about uh personal information like health data is kind of like very private and stuff so uh just for like for checking off all the things in the security audit we were supposed to have uh like what we call fingerprint scanners in the office and you weren't allowed to take any hardware outside of the office so there's like a bunch of rules and i imagine any company that requires you to like log in from a certain terminal all of that now is up up in the air right you work with whatever thing you have at home and like i like if i was still at zero maybe they would have a very good answer because they kind of are a security company but with code sandbox like the more we do in the open the better it is for us so i it's something that i've just like forgotten about yeah well let's talk about let's move to the staying sane part uh of working from home productively because i think it's clear that you all are working productively it sounds like things are still getting done uh most of you were already working from home before so it's just the same routine probably just compressed time i would imagine with uh other responsibilities and also i guess one question is like a lot of you have colleagues who weren't working from home uh and now they are and suddenly they're having to rapidly spool up on what you all had already kind of intuited about successfully working from home what would be your advice to your colleagues uh and have you given any advice to colleagues or that who've approached you and said like oh i know you work from home like how can i do this right like what would be your quick and dirty tips uh for successfully working from home if a colleague approached you and asked you colleen so i have a lot of tips because i feel like jessica it took me maybe a year to kind of like figure this out um so i think you have to remember to we're in the middle of a pandemic so as we discussed at the beginning of this your mental and emotional state aren't going to be what they would be otherwise so you need to be mindful of that but like practical tips are this um you're at home so you don't have the natural breaks that you would have in an office so do a pomodoro timer you can actually see my yoga mat behind me because i do 25 minutes of work and then five minutes of stretching um and i do that all day but um i would recommend that to force breaks first give your eyes a break just give yourself a little break i also recommend during that time do not get on social media because that will distract your brain from whatever you were working on before so i like to take those five minutes of break time and like i said like do yoga or you know throw a load of laundry in or something like that um and then the time blocking we talked about earlier i thought was um was really good that really helps and then so what i do kind of like the office i also have an office and i use my noise cancelling headphones like you guys have on and that kind of puts me in like the mental work state like when i even though i don't always turn them on like if they're on my ears like i know i'm supposed to be working so i think actually someone in the last chat talked about atomic habits but um james clear talks about that in his book as having these habit cues and so for me one of my habit cues is noise canceling headphones so that really helps okay awesome noise cancelling headphones pomodoro technique um having something you can do during that that uh break time during the pomodoro to and and staying away from social media during breaks because who you know for the second you landed twitter trending it's just it's all over like you're like what's that oh my gosh is that really happening is is the real world really this horrible now um how about you jessica what would you how would you advise a colleague who just realized that they have to work from home uh for the first time yeah i think i mean colin has some really excellent tips i think just to add to that i'd say maybe one is take breaks like i tried to get out of the house and take a brief walk a couple times a day obviously you know following whatever guidelines are in place for where you live and i think it's really hard for people who were working in a physical office until recently to feel connected especially if you're more on the extroverted side so one thing that i've been doing with colleagues is actually doing zoom meetings just to kind of catch up so like we'll do like a virtual coffee break a couple times a week if any of you have played jack box it's like a game you can play over zoom relatively easily if you share your screen just like a group game everyone plays um on their phone and so it's just kind of a fun way to have a little break in the day kind of get maybe some of that energy the social energy back okay great um and uh how about you sid yeah what advice would you have for a colleague everything jessica and coin said uh the only thing i'd add is like i first of all i really like what jessica said because it's something that i have started doing too and it's like i'm not extroverted but this is also not my happy place right like even as an introvert being logged in your house is not what introverts want right like i like the choice of going to a party i just don't like going to parties right but what i've like what i've been enjoying which is new for me is exactly what she said just calling up your coworkers just to have a chat which is not about work right just asking them how they're holding up what are they up to and just just the fact that we're all doing this together at the same time kind of takes away a lot of guilt that i get for like not being efficient or not working and i think more than like getting the work done getting away from the guilt has been really helpful for me and that kind of motivates me to get back to work uh practical tips what i like is like i'm kind of obsessed with blocking time so like early in the morning or like the night before i'll plan out what do i want to do the next day and then in the morning i'll just have blocks of time like this is this is when i make lunch right this is when my meeting is this is what i try to get done and then just making sure i have at least a few giant chunks of time where i can actually write code uh is is kind of crucial for me and the the last thing i would add is having like a ritual almost like a habit thing like we we think that we can hustle our way through this right like we all we lack is motivation to work it honestly like our brains are stupider than that so we really have to like pull them into it so i really like having like a morning start work routine where it's like i open a notepad i look at my tasks and i just write for 15 minutes and that kind of gets me in the in the headspace to start work instead of you know thinking about twitter or recently thinking about tick tock because that's what it has come to and in taking a walk so this was like my pre uh lockdown routine where i would just to end work i would go for a 15 minute work now that 15 minute has become i just like stretch on or do some exercise on my wife's yoga mat so it's like just having these tiny events or like tiny actions that kind of say that okay this ends my work day and now i'm ready for like the other stuff has kind of been useful to fool my brain into it like stop thinking about work start thinking about your wife now right on well one thing that i think we would be remiss not to cover is how is this pandemic going to affect the future of work um how is this experience of social distancing and basically all of us working from home during this period like do you think that people are going to go back to offices everything's just going to go back to normal and snap back the moment that a vaccine comes out and is widely available and we're all safely able to just return to the office like do you think that that is going to happen or do you think that this is going to cause some permanent waves well i think it will cause permanent waves because i think without a pandemic generally obviously depends on the person but working from home is just so much better so you know i'm in this social slack group with some friends and one of the guys is disabled and he's been telling he was telling us like for years he's a web developer for years company with companies wouldn't hire him because they said you can't work remotely and now surprise everyone can work remotely so you know that's frustrating for him but he's also he also thinks it's wonderful because he's like the whole disabled tech community now has been given more opportunities to work from home something they were told they couldn't do um and i mean i think for everyone most people again remote work is just it's just better so i think a lot of people are gonna push to keep it if they can and it's cheaper for the company right like office space in manhattan you know right many developers are going to realize that they are actually more productive now and hopefully after the lockdown they are going to request their employers to like allow them to work from home yeah i think so i'm kind of like double minded on that because i think a lot of developers would like it because it kind of takes away the skepticism they had right like i've talked to a bunch of friends who said this would never work right are they like no i'm an extrovert i need people around me but now that they're forced into it they were forced to also look at the good sides along with the bad side so i have a feeling like at least a bunch of developers would want to do it yes i'm also afraid that a lot of like higher ups in the team right would look at this and say we tried remote work it wasn't as productive right like this was this would be the bad case study yeah where the truth is like nobody is productive right so i think i think it would definitely increase the number of chances so if you're a company that can go remote i think you'll just there would be more demand for remote work and you can just capitalize on that by all people to work remotely and your folks would like having the choice i think would be the difference yeah so i have a question for you guys for uh do you guys have people in an office anywhere press both for sid and jessica are you is your company fully remote because i always have i have this theory that a pack of people are in the office and you're remote then it's bad for the remote person and i'm wondering if that's true right i think it depends on the company my company is majority in office so i was working remotely even before i am a minority but um i think that it really depends on the company they've done just such a great job of making remote remote employees feel on the same level as like the in person obviously you know we miss out on some of the water cooler chat and some other you know talking about projects that might come up but for the most part it's been done well so i think it may depend on the company yeah i can relate to that so i think it depends on like how how seriously does the company want to take it so at odd zero i was working with a i want to say 13 our time difference um like most of my team was in the honor service in argentina so even though they were all remote they were kind of in the same time zone um so what was interesting was that the team kind of had a rule that if they're having a meeting with one person remote they'll just go sit in different corners of the office and all join by a zoom so i think just having it's like treating everyone as equal was kind of the point and even if a decision is made in person where for example like a lot of time people would meet in the office when i'm just sleeping but they'll make sure they document it and they put it in a dock where we just like chew on it for a while and comment on it to to get the conversation so i think a lot of it is like i'm sure a lot of companies are bad when they start and then they learn this through the times and then like just having a mature process around it really helps uh right now at code sandbox we do have an office which is like it's it's we call it an office it's a room in a coworking space right so sometimes when we feel like seeing each other's faces we just end up going there so like we have three people in amsterdam including me so we end up meeting each other once a week and then every month one or two people from around europe just like flies in to spend some time in the office and that's more of like a social thing than uh it's like like there are there are coworkers that i've never met in person which kind of feels weird so this helps that once in a while you just get to sit next to them and you know i don't know look at look that they actually have legs an artist just an insight from chat jesse weigel uh frequent uh youtube streamer here on the free cocaine channel on a prolific dev he said uh he often feels that uh it's difficult to participate in a meeting when he's working remotely and everybody else is in an office and and being the remote person is kind of like you're you're the outsider and there have been studies conducted i think stanford did a study of remote work in china and they found that it's harder to get like you're just as productive as everybody else or maybe more productive because you don't have to spend a lot of time commuting but uh you are less likely to be promoted because the work you're doing isn't as visible as the people in the office so we could talk about this for another hour uh this has been fantastic i've learned so much i've gotten so much insight and i i think it's going to change how i personally work from home especially a lot of the insights i've gotten you know from uh from colleen who's done this for so long and it's great hearing how uh how sid and how um jessica's organizations are approaching this as well uh this is almost a reckoning for everybody who is previously like uh not working remotely and working with other people remotely now there's going to be a lot more empathy i think going forward when they're working with colleagues who work from home because hey everybody's going to have had that experience right it'll be it'll be kind of a permanent uh memory uh that will persist and hopefully you know make people more empathetic going forward so um i'm hopeful that that is one silver lining that'll come out of this i just want to thank you all uh all three of you for coming on it's been phenomenal uh as i said i've learned so much i've been sharing some insights in chat and over on twitter and everybody who's watching this and hears like a you know a really compelling thing like the point colleen made about people who were previously told they couldn't get a job because they couldn't work remotely because you can't work remotely if you're if you have a disability that requires you to stay home hey like there's a proof of concept now that work can be done remotely so therefore hopefully this is you know a huge boon to people in the disabled community who are who are interested in uh getting more job opportunities so yeah there's a silver lining to every cloud even a cloud is as black as this one so again i want to thank you very much uh jessica colleen sid everybody scroll down click on their twitter follow these people on twitter they're fantastic i don't regret it all following them i've learned so much from them and be sure to check out jessica's uh fantastic instagram thank you everybody we'll be right back in about 10 minutes everybody stay tuned and uh just keep each other company in chat cheers thank you we are going to be talking all about the post coronavirus pandemic uh developer job market essentially uh what you need to do to be able to get a job during this pandemic uh what your prospects are uh how you might want to change your approach and like what your odds are who's actually still hiring what kind of organizations are likely to grow during this period where opportunities are going to come from we're gonna be talking about all those things and more and i am very proud to have gotten three amazing guests who all know quite a bit about this domain um first alien learner she is extremely learned as her last name may suggest she studied at mit and is an engineer and a developer and she also worked as a recruiter and she was unsatisfied with the way uh technical recruiting worked and she founded a company called interviewing.io where you can go and you can get uh interview training and you can work with real people to get uh interviewed and you get a job through there too and maybe she can share some statistics about like the number of people who have gone through later but uh we're we're thrilled to have you with us thank you thank you andrew brown uh from toronto uh and he is a super knowledgeable guy he's worked as a developer for years and years and now he runs exam pro dot co which is a website where you can go to get uh comprehensive aws certification training and he's been working on getting as many people as possible through these certifications so they get certified so they can get the many many cloud engineer jobs that are out there and probably growing as a result of this pandemic um and so andrew brown thank you very much for joining us oh thank you and laurence bradford uh you have probably heard her if you're learning the code uh learn to code with dot me is her website it is an amazing website that she she's got a blog she's written a whole lot actually everybody here i'll just say everybody here on this uh panel has published extensively with free code camp so if they're if they seem familiar that may be one of the reasons why alien learner has written extensively about uh the job market and uh the technical interview process and shared tons of data that she's gotten from her platform andrew has created uh at least three i think four major fulllength courses that are on free code camp's youtube channel including an aws for startups and also uh through three different aws certifications and laurence has done so many amazing articles on freecodecamp as well and she has uh one of the longest running programming related podcasts out there it's the learn to code with me podcast so uh if you go into itunes or wherever you listen to podcasts just search learn to code with me and you will find her podcast and she has done 120 episodes she's she's getting ready to head into i think season uh season seven season seven okay yeah so these people are extremely prolific and knowledgeable and i'm super excited to hear their insights about uh the evolving job market so as i started with the other panels i just want to it is strange to be talking about opportunity uh in a time of death and despair and disease and i just want to emphasize that we are aware of all these things we are not physicians we're not frontline workers we're developers we're all doing the best we can we can take as a given that life kind of sucks right now for a whole lot of people and we can be empathetic about that at the same time i'm optimistic that you know 12 18 months from now there will be a widely available vaccination and life will go back to some semblance of what it was before and this is a good time for us to be thinking about that and thinking about what the world might look like coming out of that and also figuring out what we can do today to you know create a positive influence on tomorrow so uh i just want to say that right now it may seem crass that we're talking very uh transactionally very um bluntly about the developer ecosystem and the job market and all those things when people are out there dying and i just want to say that we we do care about that we're aware of those things but we're gonna we're not doctors we're not gonna give you any medical advice or anything like that we're just gonna stay focused on what we know what we know is helping people advance their developer careers so thank you with that note uh i want to go ahead and kick it off and just uh ask aileen how's everything going with you how's everything going with uh the developer job ecosystem in general at a very high level in your in your thinking yeah um things have changed quickly in some ways and they've stayed the same in others so my my whole world is my company and i'm very heads down in that but fortunately what we do is very tied to the subject we're talking about so i'll just share what we've seen and hopefully that's useful um as kind of a microcosm of what's going on everywhere everywhere else in the world so um interviewing io does two things we help people prepare for technical interviews and then if they do well regardless of how they look on paper we actually let them skip a lot of the stuff that happens at the top of the funnel like applying online or talking to recruiters and they can like directly book technical interviews with engineers at companies where they might want to work so what is uh what are the implications of that um on one hand uh we've seen a lot more engagement among our existing users right so i think people are home now more than they used to be which means they don't have to go hide in a conference room to do an interview during the work day so we're seeing people interviewing a lot more which also means there's more competition for potentially a smaller number of jobs i'll get to that in a moment we've also seen and i'll just be transparent about this um a good chunk of our customers freeze hiring and it's sort of it kind of came in this sort of um uh normal distribution like at first it was this trickle right and people are like yeah we're just gonna freeze for a week everything's fine and then you know a few days later no it's we're gonna freeze for like two or three weeks and then more and more customers came in and started freezing um those tended to be if we were to put a category there companies that are probably series a and um earlier so those companies i think are the ones that tend to have the most uncertainty and the most instability um and in some cases less runway so of course uh makes sense that they're being conservative um some of our larger customers we've seen pick up on hiring i think in part it's a response to the increased inbound applications that they're getting and in part i think it's because unless they're very very stable right let's say you're a series b series c type company right you're probably going to start seeing a little more attrition right now because some portion of your engineers are going to proactively go to the most stable jobs of all which is probably fang right facebook um apple amazon netflix google and microsoft potentially um so uh we have seen a shift to to more people applying there but we have seen a pickup in hiring especially among um these sort of larger companies that are doing things that are in some way related to solving the problems the world is facing right now maybe it's remote communication right maybe it's healthcare and healthcare is a very big umbrella that covers a lot of different things but in general we've seen that that space pick up um maybe it's logistics right uh maybe it's delivery of food uh so there have been these sort of spikes and then there's been a lot of drops and i think net if we were to average out the whole thing there's definitely been a slowdown in hiring um but it doesn't we were expecting to see maybe you know half or more of our customers freeze and that absolutely has not happened and our overall interview volume like how it's what it's constituted of has shifted but it actually hasn't dropped very much okay great so just to be clear like the number of opportunities may have decreased but it's not nearly as big of a decrease as you might think yep and who knows i mean i don't know i basically stopped trying to predict the future right uh things change so quickly like in a matter of days and our strategy has changed like three times internally now so it's a hard time for us but um so far it's less bad than i think anybody internally thought it would be okay awesome and uh alien if you could just kind of hold your mic slightly off your shirt it's just it's pushing your mic which is creating a little bit of clicking so exactly yeah no worries i didn't want to like ruin your flow or anything yeah just when you're talking and you can just mute when you're not talking so you don't have to worry about it but that's like a frequent thing i'm sure laurence has encountered that when she's doing podcasts like the itu the apple headphones always had the mic rub against the shirt collar i get very animated also like if you have jewelry on i do this like sometimes it can bang against the table and i realize that i'm like oh i'm probably so loud like right near the microphone but yeah yeah well laurence uh so you're experiencing this from a from a different perspective you have tons of friends who are applying for jobs uh what has your experience been like anecdotally yeah so my experience is really different because i'm not um working with directly people who are applying to different companies i'm not working with companies who are interviewing candidates but i've been hearing from friends and also just my own research honestly the last few weeks i don't i don't know why but i've been very into following who's hiring who's laying off um like these shifts and where like people are spending money the new york times actually published a really interesting graphic yesterday that showed it was like this really this bar chart that showed where people are spending less concerts uh restaurants a few other things that just like aren't really a reality right now when we can't go outside and be in groups but then it showed this like spike in spending in other areas like delivery services groceries i mean i know personally as a household we spent twice as much last month on groceries like going to the grocery store buying food or delivery stuff than we did the month prior and i'm so yeah i've just been fascinated with this shift and like where we're spending money how we're spending money the company's laying off the companies who are hiring more now and as you said quincy i've had friends who have been laid off or on the other hand friends that are completely overwhelmed and really stressed out with work right now because they're having the most work that they've ever had in their life and specifically the two friends i'm thinking of work in like shipping logistics ecommerce uh my my like childhood best friend growing up she she doesn't work in tech but she works in like shipping logistics for dhl which is a really big like shipping company and she has huge clients all around the globe and she's like this has been the craziest week i've worked here for five years and this the craziest few weeks has been absolutely insane but turning the conversation like back towards technology i've been really following a lot of the news again of the companies that are laying people off which there are a lot i feel like if you look at the headlines or you turn on cnn or what have you another company is laying people off and other companies laying people off but then on the flip side there are a lot of companies that are increasing hiring another friend of mine who used to work at a cannabis startup of sorts i don't know exactly what they did but i know she got laid off and i know she very quickly got an interview at a life insurance company because it's not really shocking but life insurance sales i think they've doubled or something since all the coronavirus stuff has been happening so there are these industries that maybe isn't talked about as much that are seeing an increase in demand because of all this um and as you said in the beginning quincy like it is really unfortunate that so many companies are going under or laying people off and then there are like these winners and losers but it just is i don't know the way it is right now yeah and andrew what's your experience you're you're coming to us from uh north of the border uh yeah yeah i can give you the canadian experience and i do know a little bit that's going on uh to our our friends to the south um and i would i would agree with laurence um there are industries that are definitely taking off and ones that aren't i can specifically say like if you're looking at edtech med tech or stream tech uh those ones we're seeing uh that they're uh that they're thriving because they're going virtual or you know it's direct to the pandemic or the fact that everybody has to uh now uh work virtually um other industries that uh the technical demand is growing i wouldn't say they're thriving but the the demand is there is insure tax so lauren's just mentioned that that's a really good uh point and delivery tech that's another one right how to get stuff to people or logistics uh so you know if you are looking for a job uh you know consider looking at those industries and trying to tailor tailor your resume or tailor your skills for these industries in the short term because i think that's going to help you um to talk specifically about the roles that we're seeing that people are getting laid off for for those who don't know like um you know i wasn't just a developer i was a cto um for multiple startups prior and so i'm very fortunate to be part of a network of ctos in canada and so when people say that um that companies are laying them off i literally see the ctos and the slack group saying i had to lay off these people and then what they're doing is they are trying to mitigate that by helping um uh or finding other companies to help hire these people back okay um but to talk specifically about the actual rules where i'm seeing um uh that are being deprioritized and the ones that are now scaling up on i actually made a little list here so there's there's uh what i've been seeing for people getting let go for is sales and business development digital marketing ux and web design uh in some cases uh uh uh data analysis uh and and that's why i like to think of it as that there's growth aesthetics and and analysis which are being cut down on because that's really when you're focusing on the growth of your business and right now people are being more conservative and so they're looking uh more for security reliability and support and for those kind of roles we're seeing a huge increase in a general technologist if we're talking about from the cloud perspective that's called a solution architect uh project management's very important uh cloud engineer so that's a hybrid between web developer and cloud skills virtual assistants i even have to get a virtual assistant because the increase in this um this market has been uh crazy social media support so we might have seen a decrease in people doing sales and marketing but we're seeing an increase in support uh for uh existing users uh and that stuff like that data engineers so we saw a drop with um uh data analysis but we're seeing now data engineers will become more popular site reliability officer that's someone that can make sure that the platform is running uh stable and security engineers so you know listen to that uh that list i gave you i might share it uh later on into the free code camp discord as a as a conversation after after there if you want to know a little bit more about those roles but that is my take on it and that's me looking at these lists that are coming in who's getting laid off and that stuff and by the way uh these lists are actually public um i just don't feel like they're publicized very well and so i was able to grab those links and i have a list of lists of places that are are are hiring and a list of lists that are layoffs you can go through there and you can see what's being hired for and what's not and there's another list of of of people that are getting uh that are looking for work right it's called the helpless dot ca um and i i think there's other countries doing it i just know i just know the canadian space um uh but but you look at those lists and and you can even get a feel of you know how you can align to that market to get a job uh so you know there i think that's a a bit for now so i'll tell you yeah i mean that in the background fantastic and it sounds like you have the making of like a big you know like a major article like or maybe even a regular article like hey here like this this week's update uh during the uh uh pandemic pandemic job status anyway any way i could help i'd love to write an article it's just it's people just have to ask me right so yeah right yeah well consider this a request for another there you go then you get and you'll get an article and and laurence i know you've also been trying to assemble as much information as you can and get it out there in the hands of people as far as like uh i mean we could we could absolutely run like some sort of survey or something i should actually put together a survey for this conference sorry i didn't think about that until now uh but i will i'll get that together and i'll shoot that link out through twitter so just follow the lockdown conf hashtag and look for a post conference survey a lot of people are watching live right now we're getting some questions i'll go to those in a moment thank you everybody for asking your questions please just pile all your questions in there we've got experts for the next uh 30 minutes or so and we want to get as many other questions to them as as we can and then a huge number of people probably like ninety percent of the people who are going to watch this are gonna watch this after the stream ends and just watch the uh you know the the edited version where we're gonna edit out the breaks and everything but um so uh i have a very very quick um question that i think uh i want to ask to my coemcee um how are things going in bangalore and what's the indian experience like because india is a massive country with tons of tech companies and i just heard that the uh lockdown was further extended today yeah yeah yeah the lockdown has been extended uh yeah the lockdown has been extended till may 3rd we just got the news from the prime minister this morning and uh the companies are taking it slow here from what i have heard most of the companies like food delivery companies and hyper local markets and all those companies have reduced the number of hiring here at the in the current time and most of the hiring that are going on as andrew said are on the nontechnical uh jobs right now so so yeah um it's it hasn't impacted um like some anything different from the rest of the world okay great and uh this question comes from the audience uh from elliot sanford who as i mentioned earlier we had a question from him uh he is a boot camp student and he's getting ready to graduate it's kind of like the university graduate in 2008 right like coming out to a fairly tepid job market a relatively tepid market coming out of a coding bootcamp in 2020 uh what would be uh his question is how should i as a boot camper near graduation combat negativity and what things can i do to compete against the more experienced developers in the hiring pool oh i'll start great yeah um so there are two things that make coming out of a boot camp really hard and i think these things were always hard even in a great market and they're going to be extra hard now so the first thing is even getting your foot in the door so as you probably know there is a somewhat potentially unfair bias against boot camp grads um and what makes it even harder now is that one of the other groups that we haven't talked about who's experiencing heavy layoffs is recruiters so recruiters are getting laid off like crazy which means that a company that previously potentially had a whole team dealing with junior hiring might now have just a handful of people that are scattered between sales recruiting ops recruiting um and engineering recruiting and some of them might not be domain experts in those fields because they're just being grabbed and that's what they're doing now um so it's even more important now than it ever was before to find a way to get noticed and stand out and if you apply online and i've said this before about applying online even in the best situations it's kind of like screaming into a black hole like the abyss will probably not answer you uh so if you can um just bypass recruiting entirely find an engineer that works at that company find somebody even if you don't know them maybe they wrote a blog post about something you're interested in just get on hacker news get on the company blog get on linkedin make a list of engineers that work there that you have something smart you can say to or something that you uh can talk about a shared interest you know maybe maybe you know somebody in common and just treat it like a sales job so pretend you're a sales development representative and you have a funnel and it's your job to just reach out to engineers at a bunch of companies that you want to work and to each one say something that doesn't just say hey i graduated from a bootcamp and i'm looking for a job talk about something they've done you're interested in talk about something you've done that is related to the subject matter and you're going to get a lot of you're not even going to get rejections most people will just ignore you but this will probably improve your odds of getting noticed by an order of magnitude if not more so that's the first thing the second thing that makes graduating from a boot camp really hard is being prepared for technical interviews now different companies interview differently not everybody does fullon algorithmic interviews but depending on where you're applying chances are they do and you can probably find out one of my personal biggest pet peeves with i think every boot camp under the sun is that they do not do an adequate job of preparing you for this and they also deemphasize how important it is so i would get on starting your funnel doing all your outreach to everybody to get your foot in the door and in parallel i would start heavily preparing for technical interviews code camp has a free code camp has a lot of resources of course my company does this so we'll encourage you to go to interviewing i o but there are books there there are a ton of resources out there um and i would spend weeks if not months and i'm sorry this this is going to sound discouraging but weeks if not months working algorithmic problems uh understanding data structures and filling in those gaps that your boot camp probably left in your education it's going to be hard but if you kind of embrace the idea that it's going to be hard and make peace with it you'll be successful just sort of say it's going to take three months for me to find a job maybe more i'm okay with it and in the meantime i'm gonna go heads down and focus on these two things cool awesome advice and i'm actually typing up verbatim a quote you just said aileen uh so uh andrew did you want to talk about this a little bit too oh yeah i would love to talk about it so it uh so for those who don't know i'm in the uh the greater toronto area and i actually do a lot of mentorship with boot camp grads from a variety of different ones here so we have general assembly lighthouse labs uh we cloud data and juno and so there is a bit of a difficulty getting the job at the tail end there um the career services for every boot camp is different some are some give you a lot of support afterwards um some uh put on you to to do that effort but i can give you a couple of hacks of what you could do to try to get a job in the market um and so there's there's two ways we can we can take the friendly way or we can do the cold call way and so let's talk about the cold call way um and this is my approach and i could do this today and get a job uh in a week and so so this is what i would do i would go to angel list uh camera if it's dot say or whatever the or dot io i feel like it's a dot io but if you look up angel list it has all the startups uh in the world uh per country so i would say okay what's my closest uh tech hub it's toronto or what's in my time zone as long as it's my time zone or near me that's great i'm going to sort by the greenest greenest meaning the newest startups on the market i'm going to go down the list i'm going to try to guess who is near raising money to get uh their their their it depends on what kind of risk you want to take but if you're if they're close to getting their seed or their series a i'm going to find those green companies i'm going to look at them and say um what do they do and what impact can i make on their company and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to reach out with them and i'm actually going to build them something and i'm just going to ship it to them because if you show up and hand with some something it's very hard for people to say no if you can guess what it is that's going to really help them uh it's it's very unlikely they will will turn you away but i think it's a better method than applying to 30 40 places if you uh it's better to build 10 apps that are for very specific industries and then you get to keep those apps and also um you get faster and faster building applications so you say if you think it takes a lot a lot of time that is the number one thing i find boot camp grads coming out of their curriculum is that they do not have the the technical speed um so they might have the skill but they don't have the speed and so you should be able to build out uh small applications whether it's five or ten in a week and ship those things out and you'll get a much greater response and the thing is people are always worried about giving those away for free the reason i'm not worried about doing it is that if somebody wants to utilize it they need the person that built it to maintain it and you have them on the hook so they're going to want to bring you in the door for that you've really thought about what the problem is for the business owner and a lot of startups just do not post their jobs online because they do not have time or uh there's such a small team it's just like they feel like they're wasting their time so they're gonna wait till they get to a certain growth before they post that stuff out and by taking that initiative that is a great way to get your foot in the door and also to get a role that you normally wouldn't be able to get and then quickly move up the ladder okay so that is the cold call way the other way is the friendly way and i find this works for medium to large companies and uh the idea is that you want to become friends with whoever it is uh that works for that company so if you want to work at aws you better go on linkedin you better add everybody you know that works at aws um and and be authentic and and try to be as helpful as you can and document your journey that is parallel to this company and uh you know hopefully what they'll do is they'll take notice of uh of it they'll like your stuff i never tell people to go message people directly on linkedin i say go add somebody you don't have to message them and then just if they'll see if you're active they'll see you in their stream if they're interacting with you that means they're aware of your content and then you can go reach out or you can go on linkedin say boy i wish i had a job like this and those people who have already seen it and then they'll reach out to you um and and that's the friendly canadian way to get a job i don't know if it works everywhere but it definitely works really well here so those are my two hacks for you one thing i'll quickly add if that's okay i strongly advise not messaging engineers on linkedin or adding them on linkedin because they're not they they hate it because all they ever get there is recruiter spam right so sorry so i would say that in context it depends what it is so if you want to add engineers just add them if your profile looks and by the way i have an article i think called linkedin for losers i don't know why i named it that but because it's like ll but i i agree with you i think you're right i get so much spam it drives me crazy but if you just add somebody what they're going to do is they're going to look at your linkedin profile they're going to say what is this person's motivation what why do they want to connect with with me and if you look like that you just you're interested in the same space and you're going to share cool content and you're not going to be like like spamming that person trying to get a job then they're going to add you and then down the road when you build up that friendship then you can message them or or do that subtle thing saying oh boy i wish i could work here yeah um i guess both approaches can work i in my experience i found that just figuring out somebody's email address and writing them a highly personalized email that touches on something they've done before and something you're interested in is much more effective but i uh i have not tried uh sort of the add me and then i'm gonna post interesting well i'll tell you i'll tell you the other day i got an email from somebody and and they sent me a really long email and it was great but uh it was so long and especially like when you're uh like a developer you're busy you don't have time to read long emails your brain just turns off so if you do want to take that approach make sure it's concise but the only reason i stuck with that email was because the person who sent me the email their profile was was star trek themed so they said so that is a big long thing and i'm going to read this going oh man they're just trying to they're just trying to like uh uh game me you know like trying to trying to uh build that relationship really fast um but that they had that that uh personal biased uh and that that got them a personal response back for me i wouldn't say uh that always works every single time but it just that time it worked so yeah personalization is key i've gotten so many emails where people just rehash everything they've ever done and it just reads like a generic cover letter i get dozens of those a day and i tend to ignore them i would say oh sorry about that i would say um i would say that it's not just being personable it's being authentic and i think as humans we can tell when something is off so so even if you think you're being personable it's like we know you're up to something right so personal so something that touches on something you've done something i've done something that not just friendly but something that that draws on a shared interest or or something useful that isn't just networking i think we're saying the same thing oh you don't know for certainly i'm just i'm just trying to to iterate that uh being personable is not the same thing as being authentic totally and i think that you know you can be personable but we're like okay great but we see that there's an agenda behind it um you know and i get just to interrupt like i get a lot of emails uh and a lot of them address me as sir like sir and i immediately know okay this person's probably asking for something if they're calling me sir right off the bat if that's how they address me uh and also if i get an email from you and it's in a like a nonplain text font i'm just gonna automatically archive it like i won't read it because the quality of the emails that i get that are not in like just the standard text that have some sort of formatting on them is always very low uh so it's just like pattern recognition don't use funky fonts don't use like a lengthy signature um those kinds of things are tells that uh you're not human yeah okay i had one thing oh real quick about that for the boot camp grad so i think both of your answers were fantastic and i always tell people like it's never too early to start practicing for a technical interview like yeah months in advance like even if you're not even thinking about getting a tech job yet um pandemic or not like start practicing for those technical interview questions for sure super important that can like literally make or break your opportunity of getting a tech job and competing with other people who do have computer science degrees however if you're a coding bootcamp graduate or soon to be or someone else looking to get a job in tech and you're feeling a lot of pressure because it's like wow i'm going into the job market in like the worst possible time like literally when was the last time you had a major pandemic like this affecting our lives like i don't know like like what this uh in 1918 or something so years ago yeah so yeah so like give yourself some grace like like realize that these are crazy unforeseen circumstances and if you're in a situation where you need a job to support yourself or your family it is completely okay to have a temporary job plan even if you did just go to this coding bootcamp even if you did just graduate from a degree with or a school with computer science degree uh of course go after those positions but do something else in the meantime to make ends meet and there are companies like i know instacart is doubling their customer support um staff by the end of may so i think they have 1200 now and they're going to be uh going up to three thousand like but yeah by the end of may so like six weeks or something maybe a customer support role at instacart isn't your dream job but nonetheless i think it could even be a step in the right direction depending on what industry you're coming into because instacart is still a tech company maybe you you know again maybe it's not exactly what you want but it could be a step there you could get your foot in the door at that company or maybe you could leverage that experience in the future to get a job at another delivery company of sorts but as a junior developer so give yourself some grace this is a really hard time right now and like just take that in as you you know go about your job search i would like to bring to this something to the focus here like what advice do you have for developers who are planning to uh land a job uh in companies like facebook and google because today morning uh cheryl from facebook announced that they are going to hire 10 000 people in engineering and product by the end of the year so what advice do you have for developers to apply for these companies and also crack those jobs for oh i i actually i'm not sure if i would be the best to answer this because a lot of my experience is like at startups and whatnot but i did see this statistic you're talking about as far as um facebook playing to hire 10 000 more developers which is like literally five times the size of my college that's like a town of how many developers that they're hiring i know they have a lot of employees though but i feel like eileen maybe you'd be better at answering that and like approaching um a big tech company like that yeah i mean my uh my advice is not going to be that different for those companies than than for other groups again um right now those companies are getting hit really really hard because everybody views them as a stable place to work right so uh they are some of the only ones that are advertising loudly that they're hiring during this time they also pay more so even even in an easy easy economy it's hard to get noticed and here it's going to be even harder so um if you can try to get a referral in try to um chances are a lot of them one thing that people don't know about recruiters at these companies is that most recruiters are contractors and i'll explain why i'm talking about this in a moment so um what can happen sometimes is you get reached out to by a recruiter if you're fortunate enough for that to happen and then by the time you see it maybe you missed it you reach back out to them and they're no longer there these people are usually contractors that work at these companies for six months stints and then they move on to the next place um so again i would try to forge a genuine authentic relationship with an engineer at one of these companies maybe an engineering manager maybe think about which teams might be hiring more than others you'll still have to go through that like centralized interview process but at least you'll have somebody um put your hat into the ring um so that's that's one i know that's not super useful advice the fact is like it's really really hard and it's gonna get even harder but if you are fortunate enough to get in and this is um extra important interviews at these companies are very very difficult and they tend to follow a very very specific pattern and you really only get one shot one one piece of data that we've seen on our platform over and over is that the same engineer can do very very well in a technical interview one day and then the next day absolutely bomb even if those interviews are of comparable difficulty with engineers who are comparably strict it's because the interview process is just fundamentally nondeterministic and there's just so much room for error the best thing you can do once you get your foot in the door is to spend even longer than i advise before preparing for interviews so that when you do get your opportunity you don't screw it up here's another thing that i've seen a lot of people do wrong sometimes somebody is so happy that they finally hear from one of these big companies that the recruiter who's incent i mean recruiters are incentivized to make hires as quickly as possible because they're compensated on it and they're they're uh generally uh that's like their um their bar for performance that doesn't mean that you have to interview immediately if facebook reaches out to you they get back to you and they say okay great get on the phone with a facebook engineer next week if you're not ready just push it out and they're gonna be okay with it don't panic don't say okay this is my only chance i'm just gonna cram the night before it's gonna if you've never done these kinds of interviews it will take you months so accept that push your interview off schedule it a few months out and then spend hours a day preparing so i might be able to touch a bit on the like fang or large companies there so um one of my friends he wanted to uh work at google well i don't know if he wanted to work at google but what he did was uh he was reached out from uh uh from recruiters uh within google and he went all the way he went all the way and they offered them the job and then he said no so he didn't really want the job he loved the challenge and now he he makes video games he lives on an island uh and but the thing the thing about that is that he's they said okay well who should we uh who should we hire since you're so great who can you recommend and then they reached out to me and so i was going through the process and then i did the same thing i went yeah you know what i'm having fun doing this but really i'm not going to see to the end so i'm going to stop here and they went to me and said who can you recommend so um you know if you if if you know any friends who've gone through the process um or or make friends with other people that are going through it because maybe they can pass you along and and the process is very uh uh uh random so like i was going really uh really well through google i cannot get hired at aws to save my life and it makes no sense because everybody around me you'll be able to work at says you are qualified um the process is crazy i've had like senior senior develop developer advocates reach out to me and say to me you know i had to apply five times to work to work here before i got in so you just have to take your bumps and realize that it's going to be a very difficult process i can say that you know for any of these companies assist well depends for the job but systems design is a very important thing so understanding how to build a complex systems so or looking for a systems design engineer if you google those terms those might help you understand conceptually how to put things together and obviously there's algorithmic challenges interview preparation if you could find any good services for that that would be great too um you know so that's just my two cents on uh on that part uh just one more thing to add there um if you are from india and you're coming to canada last year we started fast tracking visas to india because we really want more talent here um so so there's a lot of opportunities uh there as well if you want to work at a big company but not necessarily one of the fan companies uh there's good recruiters like uh vanhack i always hear really good things about them and you might think that right now there's no opportunities because there's no way to uh there's no way to bring people actually into canada but what what's happening is that these companies are hiring the remote and they're waiting for everything to blow over and then they bring them into canada so we're not seeing a drop uh drop in there uh if uh if you want to get into cloud jefferson frank is a really really good recruiter if you want to get in into data science roles or anything data in canada we career is really really good they're not a recruiter but they they know a lot of companies uh that can get you placed um and those those are the three recorders that i like generally i don't have a good relationship with recruiters um so i do like to mention the ones that i feel that uh do care about you and are trying to do a good job and they're the ones that are working on contract and they're trying to push every person every applicant uh into that into that uh that box you know laurence uh do you have any friends who are applying for like large you know that we say fang but that could also include you know shopify could include infosys and microsoft and a lot of other big companies that are actively applying not that i know of um i feel like a lot of the people that i'm around either well actually honestly don't work in tech because i grew up i was not in tech at all right so a lot of my friends from college and before that are not in tech uh or like startups like my husband um just like we met actually at the last art that we worked at and now he just started his new startup i do this um so a lot of like the people that were kind of around a lot of the time are more so in the startup world but i have been reached out by or i have been reached out to from recruiters from google definitely and um one of the things that you're saying andrew in your example i know that at least one of the people it was because someone else i know that he was working at youtube he gave her my information because i also do think please correct me if i'm wrong um but say if i did end up working there he would get a referral he would get like a bonus right yes so like they really incentivized employees for good people yes yeah i i'm not sure if it's the same with candidates as well but yes yeah i don't yeah i'm not sure about that but yeah for the people who work there it's like good so they a lot of times will like share qualified people that they know of to the recruiters that work at those companies so yeah but yeah well so there's a pretty big gulf because a lot of people are in kind of startup land and other people are in like big company land like their they've kind of got their sites set on working for a big known company um uh elene what would be your advice to somebody because we already heard a little bit from andrew about applying to smaller startups uh but what how would you vary your approach if you were going to go on the job market today as a developer and you wanted to work at like a small upcoming company like for example code sandbox uh sid from code sandbox was on the previous one and they're they're growing they're still very small it's like i think you said like nine people maybe a company that has closer to like 50 people like how would your approach be different there than applying to a microsoft or an amazon yeah depending on the company size let's say it's under 20 i would probably reach out directly to a founder and ideally the cto right that person is the one that has the most leeway to make exceptions companies of that size are typically biased against hiring junior talent because uh when you're that small you don't always have the luxury of thinking months years ahead you're often kind of thinking uh just a couple months ahead and that means that you may not have the bandwidth to train somebody up and depending on the constitution of your team you may not have the mentorship ability to get somebody from a to b right but rules are meant to be broken um people that are not the founder will probably be more riskaverse about breaking those rules because everybody has some amount of social capital at a company or and you use it you like you get a few shots right and you you try to spend it on things that are going to have the best outcome but if you're a founder you can do all sorts of crazy right so um i would i would probably reach out to a founder and um you know write the best most concise most authentic email that i can if i can get an introduction to them even better understand that founders are very very busy they're probably not spending more than a few seconds on any email so just say in the first two sentences who uh what you want and then explain why you deserve it and that's the whole email right maybe link to some things if you've done cool stuff uh for a slightly bigger company um who probably is hiring juniors because they do have that mentorship and within the ability to think ahead more um you may want to reach out to say a director of engineering um sometimes you get lucky and you find stuff they've written about hiring and if you can find something they've written about hiring and reference that and of course tell a compelling story about how hiring you fits into their world view and thesis that's a win they will definitely they might not hire you but they will at least answer you and once you have your foot in the door then it's just on you to show that you're capable um but you know uh in in this climate if you have a limited amount of time and i would probably not spend it on applying to very small companies because they're dropping like flies all right well that's some really good advice just just to recap what she said there a lot of people are proud of their hiring process and they will publicly write about it like i don't know if i've actually written about how free code camp hires but like if you want to work at free code camp you just have to be a prolific volunteer contributor and 100 of our hires come from people who are already essentially working as volunteers in the develop the developer community so if you can find like how they hire that can be huge information because you can just kind of go right into that flip stream and uh present yourself as an ideal model so knowing a lot about the interviewing party and their uh their thinking on things and how they think about yeah yes and we have been getting a lot of requests from twitter uh andrea would you mind resharing the recruiter's lists so i absolutely will yeah you should open source on github make a list or something and then share it with everybody oh yeah people tell me to do it i'll do it yeah and and laurence if you want to write something we would happily propagate these kinds of things because this is precisely what people are looking for is just some some information that they can go on uh but the one of the big takeaways i'm getting especially from hearing aileen uh talk is we should be practicing as much as possible and this might be a really great time to just really go deep on learning algorithms data structures design patterns and just getting really good at programming so that you can really nail those interviews you can apply to hundreds of jobs and you may have to apply to hundreds of jobs anyway to actually get uh interviews and get offers but that process will be much easier if when you actually do get those interviews and when you you know you're prepared what yeah so in terms of just very quick advice for like what people should prioritize and you know let's say that they have been handed this block of time that they you know had previously eight hours of sleep eight hours of work eight hours a leisure very few people actually had that split it's probably closer to like four hours of leisure maybe seven hours of sleep but if people do suddenly have a few extra hours a day what would be the most efficient allocation of that time and we're just going to go once around and that'll be our closing question uh we'll start with you aileen great so um if i it's going to depend on your seniority level so for this i'll assume that you're junior and you haven't done a lot of this before there's one great book whose name escapes me but that i will get after this and tweet it out the theme of the book is basically algorithms and data structures for nontechnical people that just learn to code so it breaks it down in this very approachable way and isn't super mathy is just mathy enough um i think it's exceptional so i will get that uh that's step one is to just get your head around what you're dealing with step two is to work problems on your own there's leet code and then there's a great repository of problems that actually shows you exactly the steps that you would take to solve them called interview cake big fan of both of those step three once you've read a read a little bit about this and then actually work some problems is to start practicing um we are not the only practice site out there i think we do a great job but even if you don't use us if you go to interviewing dot io slash recordings or just go to our main site and then in the nav bar there's a link called watch interviews you can actually watch other people practicing it's kind of like a boring twitch if you will but if you haven't seen these interviews before you're just going to see what interviews are like with google engineers and microsoft engineers and linkedin engineers and airbnb and a bunch of other companies so just watch those and then once you get over the shock then start practicing because working problems on lead code is very very different than working a problem while somebody is breathing down your neck and watching your every move it's really really nervewracking but the good news is once you get used to it and once you get used to thinking out loud it gets better and then of course um potentially one of your practice interviewers who's probably from fang can refer you into that company so there's there's a journey if i were to do it awesome thank you alien uh and uh laurence if you were if you were going to go apply for a job and you had some time how would you how would you spend that time preparing for a job application spree yeah i think i mean everything that she said about interviewing was great information i think beyond that though just trying to build a community and build i don't like to use the word connections because it feels so like oh yeah i'm like going networking events which we can't even do right now can't go to meetups or networking events but just building friends essentially that work in the tech space so obviously free code camp is a great resource for that there's also a number of different slack communities for developers or for other folks that work in technology or design um there are online events like this and i know because i keep seeing a bunch in the news there's other kinds of online conferences and i imagine they have like maybe like virtual breakout groups of sorts where you can meet other people and i think that is just like a great way to spend your time right now and as you were i'm chatting before about getting jobs at startups i just remembered i had a flashback to someone i worked with at my last company who studied philosophy in college he was the company's first customer support hire he wasn't great at that role but he taught himself how to code on weekends and nights and he ended up building the first internal staff app no one asked him to do it he just did it on nights and weekends super helpful for the company he then became an engineer and now to this day it's like six years later he's leading the entire internal tools pod and has people reporting to him and this was someone who learned to code on nights and weekends has a philosophy degree and he just kind of showed up put himself out there did things on his own took you know initiative and of course made connections with people at the company or made friendships and he's still there to this day so i think just making yourself useful and building um or building friendships okay awesome and andrew oh cool yeah so i would say uh you want to build and ship and document okay so build applications ship them off to small startups document your your journey so so people can uh can find how you're doing stuff i believe there's a lot of startups small startups that are are hiring you you can uh create yourself your own role that is irreplaceable uh and i think there's a lot of there's companies that are going away but there's a lot of companies that are are thriving in this industry so look for those particular techs and try to focus your energies uh there and i think if you do those three things i think that's gonna be a lot more valuable than anything else because if you can produce a value or result for a company in the form of an application that is your proof right um so that's that would be my approach awesome well i want to thank all three of you uh everybody watching scroll down follow these people on twitter they're super interesting check out interviewing.io check out exam pro and of course all the awesome free courses that andrew has already published on freecodecamp for aws certification check out the learn to code with me podcast and laurence's blog there are a ton of resources out there everything you need to prepare for the developer interview process is out there just explore those resources i hope you all learned a whole lot from these three people who've been there and who've done that and are kind of sending information back through time to you at your earlier stage in your careers um thank you all and we'll be right back with our final panel of the day which is around finding freelance opportunities so don't go anywhere uh enjoy some slides and some some music for the next 10ish minutes and we'll see you in a sec thanks thank you everybody thank you hey everyone welcome back this is the final segment of lockdown conf 2020 we might do another one depending on uh feedback uh i am going to get a survey out uh shortly after the event with the hashtag lockdownconf uh so if you all have feedback on ideas you'd like us to discuss for future events let us know but i am thrilled to introduce you all to three prolific uh freelance workers very experienced in this field they're also people who have contributed a great deal of uh lessons and and courses to frico camp over the years uh first bolaji uh from nigeria he is a seasoned freelancer and most recently he's working at hashnode as a developer and uh he knows quite a bit we're going to hear a lot from him hello how has everything going with you bolaji hi quincy how's it going great to have you here uh next we have phoebe faddell she is a developer in the uk and she has also worked extensively as a freelancer and now is working fulltime at a company as a developer um welcome phoebe thank you quincy it's good to have you here and we have luke siciliano who literally wrote the course and the book on uh freelancing and he has uh done an incredible amount of freelancing over the years he i believe has done 25 years worth of freelancing and running a consultancy that does freelance development work and seo consulting and things like that so we're privileged to have with with us this walking talking repository of freelancing wisdom so thank you very much for joining us luke oh well thanks for having me it's honestly it's my pleasure to be here so yeah well uh we are going to be talking extensively about freelancing this is a time when many people are looking for work uh many people have unfortunately lost their jobs just in the united states alone uh unemployment claims which is just people who can actually successfully get through the phone to claim unemployment benefits uh 16 million people over the past three weeks so this has been absolutely devastating uh to people here in the us and i imagine also in in nigeria and in the uk and europe uh and we are going to um we're going to delve into all that but i just want to preface this with everybody who has who's listening here who has been laid off or has been furloughed we're very sad about that situation we're gonna do everything we can in our power to give you the tools that you can go out and you can find other organizations in need small businesses large businesses uh nonprofits other organizations and that you can help them solve their own problems uh through technology as a as a freelancer so um my first question to all three of you uh and and we can start with phoebe um what is freelance software development and how would you describe the field of freelancing as far as you know doing software development um so from my experience i i freelance for experience because um i'm a career changer so i went from one industry into another and a lot of what i was doing i was learning at home and i wasn't having that kind of sort of more practical experience so i started freelancing and the easiest thing for me to do was to do wordpress sites because it's you know it's very low cost for the client and so from that point of view i kind of approached um sort of local businesses and family and asked them if they wanted websites so i started quite lowkey um purely for experience um and it kind of like snowballed from there really because i just did one site and then word got around and then it kind of you know kind of had a life of his own so um yeah so i think for me it was started off just to get some experience but then it kind of became a bit of a side business next to my studying and also i was looking after my two kids at home because i was a stayathome mom as well so for me you know you know i i wasn't aiming for something that i was going to do for long term but it kind of ended up that way yeah and if if anybody is interested in phoebe's story it's really remarkable and uh she's written about it at length uh if you just google from stay at home mom to freelance developer i think is the headline you'll pull it up maybe somebody can share it in the chat for everybody but so phoebe used freelance development as a way to transition into tech and i think that's pretty common uh bolaji how about you how would you describe freelance development and and your experience freelancing in the past okay um so basically i've been freelancing for like two years now and at the point when i started i was just possibly a beginner and like you know before you get hired you have to get a point where you're really experienced at least um surpass the interviews and all that right so at that point i wasn't really so good but i knew what i was doing and so that's one of the best way i could practice my skills you know try it out with friends families and know hey i can do this i can do that and all that so and then people were really interested in help having me build stuff for them and then through that i was able to get started with building projects and all that and i was able to build stuff like a lot of stuff and then i had um so many clients around me and then while growing i was learning more and then i eventually um got hired and started working professionally but still i still feel as even up to now like a few days like virtually every month because like i started with freelance and like it's really cool awesome and uh luke tell us a little bit about your experience in 25 years ago how you got into freelancing um i would say more than anything it really just started by coming across a few people with some problems that i knew how to solve the specific answer to your question is i got asked to write an app for a local deli that wanted to have a street fighter 2 tournament back when playing games in the arcade was like actually a thing so i wrote an app so he could track that and then one thing led to another i would really just define freelancing more than anything else as as an individual solving other people's problems i mean and as long as you just keep doing that people are going to keep calling you okay awesome and uh let's start with talking about what kind of how the market may have changed for freelance developers because prior to freelance developers you know we weren't in a global recession like we are now a lot of people had a lot more cash on hand now things may have tightened a little bit the kind of people who are looking for freelance help may not be looking anymore others may have new problems that they're looking for freelancers to solve perhaps you could talk a little bit about uh the kinds of new clients you're getting luke and and how they're approaching you um right now i would say it it's the markets definitely changed in number one like you were saying earlier i mean we're all really fortunate to be in a spot where we can keep working right now as opposed to being furloughed and so i'm just kind of trying to make the most of that opportunity in terms of clients right now the first thing i noticed is quite a bit coming in from current or previous customers just to give an example i built a progressive web app for a small church about a year ago and because of what's going on they couldn't hold services so they wanted to integrate video streaming into their website so getting a surprising number of calls from either customers i've been helping on an ongoing basis or previous customers just needing something else done in some regard in terms of other business beyond that i think that this has really created possibilities while i know a lot of people may look at a time of crisis like this and think that possibilities may be decreasing it's true that a lot of possibilities decrease but other ones open up because anytime anything creates a problem for small businesses that's a problem that needs to be solved and nine times out of ten or a lot of i shouldn't say nine times that temp a lot of times developers can solve those kinds of problems so it's definitely creating opportunities anything ranging from for example um the small local restaurant that knows they've needed a new website an app for the last 10 years and they've just never gotten around to it now all of a sudden they're prioritizing that so you know people can order online um you know the consulting firm that's used to dealing with people oneonone now they've got to deal with everyone virtually so they need a mechanism where people can securely submit documents to them um things like that this has really changed the business needs of a lot of different types of companies out there now that those are problems that developers can solve so those are the new kinds of customers i'm largely seeing as people that now have a problem that they didn't have before and they need that problem solved and like i said that's after just doing things for previous customers yeah and that makes perfect sense so your previous customers are proactively reaching out to you because you're on their radar right and and they know that you have proven that you're capable of solving the problems in the past so they're reaching back out to you um phoebe if you were to uh like not magically not be working in your current job hopefully that doesn't happen but let's say hypothetically you were to go back on the market as a freelancer like how would you reestablish contact with past customers and let let them know like hey i'm i'm back in business and whom would you approach and like what would be your general strategy for that um well actually i maintain contact with all my clients a lot of them um i have like a care package with them so i maintain their domain and their hosting and i get in touch with them you know once every couple of months and sort of say is everything okay just checking in so i kind of maintain that relationship with them anyway um but in terms of sort of finding new clients i think it's just um usually actually i get approached i get approached now um even when i'm working fulltime um and with the pandemic actually i think people have had that kind of downtime when they start thinking about um i should really get back into looking into that website i need to update so i've had um actually a few contacts that i've got in touch with me saying can you work on the website so a lot unfortunately i've had to turn people away but i've referred it to other people i know in the field um so it's kind of it's kind of a strange situation because i noticed that the work stopped and then the moment that this horrible situation happened people started getting back in touch so um i guess like you know i would probably approach local businesses see if they're okay and sort of say do you need any kind of updating um and that's what i did when i was freelancing anyway i would sort of make contact and usually through my existing networks so it doesn't come across as cold calling i guess so you know say hey i know this person you know heard that you might possibly need a website updating and i think that works best kind of building that trust um and you know having that kind of credibility already so it's you know if you get referred on by someone else that really helps so awesome and it's great to hear both of you have existing relationships that are continuing with these people and a lot of things that if you're new to freelancing you may think oh i built that and it's done but it sounds like a lot of your work uh as a freelancer is maintenance of code and making sure that things continue to work would you would you say that's accurate phoebe yeah i agree yeah definitely and it's just you know a lot of time you know um some of my clients don't have a massive budget so they say oh i want this and i said but they can't afford to do it and i said well that's fine you know we can build features on top you know once you get the budget um so it's it's you know so it's kind of prioritizing what they want and what they need and trying to differentiate the you know rather desire versus what they actually need to get the website off you know so um yeah so i say definitely maintenance and just adding new features as well um it's just kind of a continued relationship awesome and uh fazel uh within the hashnow community what pro what proportion of people would you say that are really active on hash node are interested in freelancing or doing freelance development um i would say uh we don't get a lot of questions or discussions specifically for related to freelancing so uh i'm not sure that we can i can come up with a number on number of people who are actively looking for freelancers on hash product because uh we don't get questions on those uh on on this area okay well well do you uh have you noticed any discussions around this uh yeah uh with linking yes yes uh one question that i have um like uh often come across is people like there are developers who are uh trying to get into freelancing for the first time there's maybe there's maybe new new uh developers beginner developers or experienced developers so what advice do you have for people like this how can they start their freelancing career okay awesome uh and uh have any of you found like aside from uh luke's comprehensive course by the way uh it's right here on this youtube channel you can check it out after this if you're interested in freelancing uh it's several hours long and it he also has like a lawyer like a small business lawyer and like an accountant uh so it's kind of full spectrum small business advice for people who want to become freelance developers and i strongly encourage everybody to check that out aside from that what are some other resources you all have found over the years that you've found helped you a lot communities or other learning resources that are useful for premises that they should be aware of i would i honestly think the things i found most useful are not necessarily even uh related to uh working as a coder or freelancing in general but just uh general business books uh general personal finance books things of that nature um i strongly strongly and a whole bunch of stronglys think that you know working for yourself as a developer or working for yourself as an independent baker or working for yourself running you know as an independent auto mechanic really aren't all that different i think you know a lot of it just kind of comes down to the same ideas and some same basic principles um so i think anyone who is trying to strike out on their own right now in addition to just reading as much as they can about uh you know i guess i'm trying to say don't limit your reading to how do i start up my independent dev shop or how do i start making money as a freelancer start reading as much as reading and absorbing as much as you can about being selfemployed in general i would say that that's the probably the best resource that a lot of people could engage in a couple of books i would probably suggest just off the top of my head um one is called the millionaire next door um i actually think that should be required reading in high school so that's just you know my personal opinion which you know it doesn't count for much obviously that one a book called the innovators by walter isaacson is you know like a really really good one and a book called profit first which is really just about managing the finances of a small business profit first might even be the first one i would say somebody should read right now yeah and i haven't read the millionaire next door but my understanding is it's an older book and it it really uh the book's core thesis i think is that anybody who's working like a middle class type job and this may not be completely true in 2020 where we've got you know a lot of people working as contractors and having limited access to opportunity but people who are making like the median level wage for an american which would in america it's about i think it's like sixty thousand dollars is now the median wage it's gone up a little bit um if you can figure out ways to cut costs and save a whole lot of money you can use that as a nice cushion and you can invest that in the stock market maybe not the stock market but you'll you'll get enough recurring revenue from that that it just keeps reinvesting and i think it's like the benjamin franklin quote about like the most powerful forcing the universe's compound interest right uh yeah actually that may have been einstein quote because it doesn't sound as profound coming from somebody who's focused on money but from somebody who's focused on science i think that compound interest is so powerful uh so so just to to process a little bit about what luke said there general business books can be just as helpful as anything else because a lot of what you're trying to do is figure out the physics of business uh so that you can keep your organization alive and that ultimately you can provide your for your family and uh you know keep the the cash coming in which is the lifeblood of any business um so so thank thanks for sharing this uh yeah so one question that we have is how can uh freelancers market themselves developers developer freelancers can market themselves during these times right if they are starting out what uh do you have any tips for them and it'd be great to get uh your perspective on this belagi if you have advice since um i know uh nigeria is very competitive market there are a lot of really skilled developers there yeah yeah right so when it comes to marketing it starts from your network itself um it's much more like internal than external so marketing starts from your small peers like your friends your families your neighbors and all that so like you start marketing from people around you um like your closest sphere should understand that this is what i do and then they are the ones who like go out and market you external and say oh i have a friend that does this so you possibly might not be able to reach out to someone um let's secrecy i might not be able to reach out to chris's friends but quincy knows me right and he knows i i do the stuff and i do it well enough so quincy can go out and talk to his friends about me and say oh i do this stuff and then that's it they reach out to queen c and queen c connects me today i'm like i've done like huge marketing right there like without having to um do a lot of marketing strategies and all that like i just work with my peers and work with my friends right and another great option you might want to try out is social media like that's a really good place to like market yourself one thing you should note about marketing is people would um love you if they can see what you're doing right so like i'm not just marketing and saying hey i can view this stuff and then that's it no i told you i can do this stuff and this is the stuff i've built right and then i look at it and i'm like wow this is awesome i like it like how can i reach out to you can you do the same stuff for me right so i am marketing with like proof i'm showing them samples of stuff i've done and then through that i can get more um clients and more returns from that so it's very simple start marketing from your peers like your small friends and families and then as much as you're trying to market on social media or other platform try as much as possible to show samples show them stuff you build like live projects and all that and through that you would be able to like get a lot of clients that would be interested in you and even if they would not be interested at that moment like it's more like stored in their catalogue and they're like ah there's this guy i saw like one month ago oh i'm used to this awesome stuff right and i want to reach out to him so like just by doing that alone you're preparing like more clients for yourself so that's it basically awesome and uh one question that we have from chat is uh how do you figure out how much to charge as a freelance developer and uh how do you triangulate prices that clients will actually pay you that's a hard one yeah i mean like i think for me um because i was new to the scene and i hadn't had much experience um i kind of just did it as i'm starting from the bottom i'm just going to charge my time because i'm getting experience people are taking a chance from me and i kind of took it from there really and also with demand so the more demand that came in i kind of adjusted my prices accordingly because you know um so i i kind of like response to market almost but at the start i did kind of offer a i built um my first site for free because i wanted the experience i kind of want to do a real kind of client relationship but not have kind of pressure on myself and then um and then from there i kind of did what i would call the equivalent of minimum wage um and then once i kind of built up my confidence and i thought ah okay and now i can start charging kind of more the rates that i i think equate with my skills so it's just kind of building up from there really and you know it's it's a hard one i mean like it also depends on your clients budget and you kind of don't want to undersell yourself but you also have to sort of if they say we've only got x amount of pounds to do this site you can say i can build this this and this for you and you kind of prioritize what can be built so i would say it just depends on your experience and and just take it from there really the more you build the bigger your reputation becomes you get more kind of clout and then you can probably just start charging a bit more so i kind of adjusted as i went along and that makes that makes sense and that's a really reasonable way to approach it um and how about you luke like how have you negotiated uh price elasticity among your uh your clients um fortunately right now i'm kind of in a phase where my price is my price and i don't don't negotiate it down too much to be frank um now if i wasn't in that situation um i think what phoebe said uh just said hits the nail on the head more than anything when she said uh when the client says here's my budget and you say i can do a b and c um to do i just think that's an import just such an important part of selling something and coming up with the right price if you know if a customer says you know i want items one two and three and and the developer just says here's what it's going to cost and they say that's not what's in my budget that that's kind of the developer saying too bad and then you know the person's obviously not going to buy the services and it's not good for anybody another way to think of that is don't end by telling somebody no right if somebody says i need one two and three and this is my budget and you just say no then that's just the end of the conversation whereas what if you say here's what i can do for you so it's kind of like well um you know i can't build you your own uh you know i can't you know i can't build your own uh video player but i'm happy to embed youtube for you so you can stream it live so in other words end with what you can do for them as opposed to what you can't do for them and then they suddenly feel like they're getting a deal within their limited budget and it helps make the sale helps keeps the price down it just works out better for everybody and a lot of times uh clients may not know what they want and they may but they do know what the problem is so they're the stakeholder they can describe what the problem is and as a freelancer you can interpret that problem into a potential solution and right size it and you know make it like like you just said the cost of creating your own video streaming stool and uh having your own video player and all that stuff may be prohibitive but the cost of embedding youtube may only be you know a day's work uh to be able to have them have a tool where they can update the video and everything right so yeah yeah i think what you just said is actually really really important um i've finished uh two sports related apps for different clients i would so doesn't matter let's call it within the last 30 days and um you know and everybody else on the panel will can talk we'll say this too that you know when we get clients that call us a client will say you know i want whatever it is they want and it's really important to give those clients feedback you can give them possibilities that they didn't know they had in front of them they obviou they'll instantly see how those possibilities can you know help their business and it's also important to give them feedback if they're saying they want certain features or functionality that you know from having done something similar is probably a bad idea it's important to in polite terms explain to them why it's a bad idea why they shouldn't you know spend the money on that and um so on and so forth and that also just really goes a long way towards a getting people to sign up for with you be you know helping them you know get the most for you know like their money and and things of that um you know it's really important as a freelancer to think yourself as a problem solver and it's hard to solve a problem without giving feedback to somebody right um so i just i just think you really just hit the nail on the head that's really important to not just take a call and say someone says to you i want one two and three and you just say okay it's really important to give them that feedback um i just want to add to what luke said um yeah i mean i completely agree about giving the client feedback because a lot of the time they don't know what they want or they don't know how the best way to solve the problem so um and i find that you know some people probably think oh i shouldn't really say that i think i'm being critical but in fact they appreciate the advice because you're you know you you have more experience that you know what you're talking about so um they're like i never thought of it that way so actually giving back feedback is is probably a good thing and you should be honest as well i think that's that's another thing don't just keep on saying yes yes i think that's a great idea i think being honest and they actually do appreciate that so yeah i just wanted to add that to luke's comments awesome uh i have an interesting question for luke uh look if you had to start freelancing today what are the three things you would not do what are the three things i would not do if i had to start that list is probably a lot longer than three things first of all um and it would also include a lot of the mistakes i made early on um if i had to start over today um i would say some of the things um that i would definitely stay away from and this is going to sound counterintuitive to a lot of people i wouldn't focus on trying to get as many sales as possible on day one i would really focus on trying to get that first sale and doing as good a job for that client as i could in other words get that first product in and probably just focus on that until it's out the door because then not only have you been paid for a completed product you've got someone who's a potential referral source now because you've just done a really good job for them um so one thing i think a lot of people a big mistake a lot of people make early on myself included is how do i get my name out there to as many people as possible on day one it's like no no get your name out there to one person who will hire you today you know that's that's probably the first thing i would do the second thing i would definitely avoid and this is going to sound counterintuitive to a lot of people is i would avoid going to a lot of networking events which is another mistake i made early on um you know once when you go to a networking event there are so many hours in a day and that time is gone forever and for the most part it's all they're all a little different but for the most part you're hoping to meet people that will connect you with other people at networking events i think if you're going to go out and try to sell yourself to people like that it's you can just as easily spend that time walking into the local bakery and saying hey you know i notice you don't have online ordering i notice you don't have this let me solve these problems so go out and try to meet your customers one on one as opposed to trying to meet them through other people that was another mistake you know i made early on um and i would say the third mistake um that i probably made early on that i would uh definitely not repeat is and this may sound like i'm on my soapbox but you know definitely learning as much as i can about the business issues from day one getting set up for proper tax structures and things of that nature um because kind of what quincy was saying about compound interest earlier is really true and if you start off with some bad structures in place and by structures i mean how you've structured your business for taxes um how you've set up some of your workflows and those kinds of things if you start off in a bad spot those things are just going to compound as you start getting uh more customers and more and more money bleeds out of your business as a result of it so you know in not necessarily in those orders in that order those are the three things i would really not do is you know and again i think what i did early on is what a lot of people do i thought oh boy i'm in business and i just went plowing out without thinking about how do i structure things for taxes and you know like like things of that nature and at the end of the year i regretted it you know like way back when so wow that's a great list how about you phoebe um i would say yeah i mean it's it's it's different from because i used to work for a company they took care of you know paying me or the taxes and there's quite a steep learning curve when you go selfemployed you know you have to you know you have to do selfassessment in the uk you have to be aware of you know you have to have um insurance to make sure that you know that you don't get if you get sued you're covered you know things like that that you don't necessarily think about because you you haven't had to think about it yet so i think it's like what luke said it's just kind of having that infrastructure in place you know using kind of an online accounting tools um so i started using wave which was an invoicing tool rather than producing them um you know things like that just kind of learn as you go on the job um but it is quite hard i mean i think you have to have to be prepared for that you you know you don't have someone else taking care of that you don't have like a hr department you don't have a finance department you know so it's all you so if you are going to freelancing just just kind of be aware of that and um read up on it make sure you're aware of what's you know you need to do to to um so that you don't get hit by the tax man and you get fined etc so um yeah i mean i think for me i didn't realize how much was involved um and i wish i was better prepared for it at the beginning but you know once i did learn i i made sure that i caught up with it so awesome and uh bolaji what are some things that you made mistakes you made early on that you've uh kind of learned from okay yeah um so the first thing would be understanding that i'm freelancing it's not just about writing code like it's way much more than just writing code like it's it decompasses communication marketing and so much more so like if you focus at the early stage is just writing code you would miss out from so many goodies i've had times where i had to write like serious complex features for the clients but meanwhile they really don't want all that and then at the end i have to like cut down most of these things and i'm like what this is really good like you need this you need and then like i don't need it i know that's right so um the ability to communicate well with your clients it's very very essential because like luke said like most of them don't know what they want and most of when they have ideas of what he wants but like not like the full idea and then when they tell you i want x and then tell them oh you can you can get like an x y z or something like oh this is cool and most time you can tell them um you can get like an x y z and they tell you um i don't really need that that's too complex for me at the moment and then you have to go back and forth i'm trying to communicate with them it's like first of all on the standard it's not just about writing code like it's way much more than that so if you're working for a company you have tax and also you just go just pick a ticket and just work on your tax for freelancing you're trying to build something for someone who is not you it's like you have to put yourself in their position and try to understand what they want and this also leads to like my second um regrets that i would like which i never did is try as much as possible to give feedback to your clients like um let's say weekly okay let's say the deadline for the project is like one month try to give like demos in like maybe four times in a month because like if you wait to the end of the one month you might present the entire day when they're like wow why this why it happened you have to go back and revert so many things like right so you can do weekly demos with them and then the first week you look at it and tell you what um i change this and change that and you can easily revise because it's not going so far but like imagine you've gone like one month into the project you have to go back to like three weeks ago like that's really really stressful so the ability to give feedbacks to your clients like um weekly or like three days it's very very important and i think the last one for me would be to automate stuff like i made i always tell people like as much as we are developers like we have so much to do like there's so much to do you have to install this installed and like the tooling we use is quite much more than the code we actually write so like one thing we should try to do is um automate stuff and that's one mistake i never did so like the time i spent trying to do some basic stuff if i had automated them i wouldn't have to spend that time doing those things so like you can use aliases and and so much more like try to automate some of your toolings and workflows so it makes um it gives you much more time to like do more works like that's it awesome that's an excellent answer all three of you have a lot of wisdom on this topic um i want to talk a little bit about the experience of trying to because a lot of people ask like oh i'm in india specifically trying to find freelance opportunities and i realize that's probably very different from the us in terms of like we have completely different types of businesses here in the us and lots of different opportunities are there any is let me just say is there any advice that you think specific to people in your country or your region uh might be really helpful for uh finding freelance customers uh and because i i'll just say that like a lot of people a lot of times i'll give people freelancing advice i'll be like oh well why don't you try talking to this and this and they'll be like well it's a little bit different in india we don't have that like uh i i realize this is a really really vague question but i'm just curious if there's some insight that i as as an american uh am missing out on that in the more global freelancing field might be like super actionable i think um it's something i mean i don't know if it's specific to the uk but i found um that kind of um approaching people face to face i mean i know we can't do that now but during the pandemic but just kind of all picking up the phone um that really helped kind of having that kind of onetoone relationship um and i noticed that when um you know particular clients they kind of wanted you more local so uh they didn't want someone who was abroad they wanted someone local that they can sort of go to it's kind of like even though you can work remote they kind of wanted that safety net like you know we want to be able to you know call you or you can come to us and you know you can talk it out so it's kind of um i don't know if that's specific to the uk but i found that with clients they kind of it does help kind of being in that local area and having the option to to kind of get in touch with you when they can on their time zone and um or in person or on the phone it's just that kind of availability thing i don't know if it's if it's kind of a specific uk thing yeah and i find that too that of the new customers i get who aren't you know existing i mean i get them from all over but i do get a surprising number just from people that are looking for somebody in their local market the one thing i'll say wherever anybody is is yeah it try to approach people from a problemsolving standpoint i know i keep saying this over and over and i i don't mean to sound like a broken record um but like right now you know like here in the united states and here in dayton i think just about everywhere in the united states uh most restaurants for just as an example most restaurants can only do you know like carry out so instead of you know if you're gonna call let's say you're gonna cold call people instead of cold calling you know just random businesses you know the restaurants have a problem that needs solved you know they need people to be able to order food online and schedule a time to pick it up and things like that so instead of saying i'm gonna instead of taking the approach of i'm gonna look for work and i'm just gonna call every business in my neighborhood you know like let's say or something of the sort what i would say is identify a class of customers and under the example i just gave restaurants and you know then say here's a class of customers what problem are they having specifically right now especially right now with everything going on and when you call them you know you're not going to have to tell them they have a problem they know they have a problem and you know i think a lot of people would be surprised at how often they are pleased to be getting a call from somebody you know is reaching out with a problemsolving standpoint you've got an issue let me fix it for you and so i think whatever market you're in whether it's a state somewhere in the u.s whether it's a another country like india whether it's a place like the uk or just pick a place try to identify what kind of problems people in that market are having and present yourself as someone that's solving them and i really do think that's the biggest answer to the question and one of the things that you touched on there is because we're all trapped in our homes uh due to the pandemic and and doing the responsible thing in social distancing and in virtually every country i think in some places like south korea they've got the testing so on lockdown that they are able to release the lockdown that was really bad sorry um but what i wanted to ask is what are some strategies because you know there's of course email there's calling but what are some some ways that generally seem to work for contacting people virtually when you can't just walk into a bakery and and say like hey i've been using your bakery like buy something and then like use that as like a reciprocation technique or something like that by the way i can build this for you you know when you can't actually talk to people face to face and you have to rely on email communication or other modalities what are some tips are there any specific platforms that you found really helpful for finding clients anything like that i mean honestly i my first suggestion would be to just call people on the phone and and if you call and leave someone a voicemail or a message on their machine and you know say you're calling a local business and they don't call you back don't be shy about calling say over the course of a week or two don't be shy about calling two or three times now after a while if they don't call you back then obviously you stop calling them but don't be shy about you know call you know calling two or three times um getting someone on the phone is just a lot more personal than you know an email or something of the sort um so a i would say get people on the phone but also as soon as you get people on the phone you know uh pres i would say present it from their perspective um you know like let's say uh uh like i just built an app for a laundromat in my local area and uh what's a dry cleaning establishment and just because of the situation he doesn't want people coming up to the window you know he wants people you know scheduling stuff and so when i call him and uh talked to him about i know you you know you um i know you're preferring to just do scheduling like etc etc and i said let's build something so people can just schedule online with you okay um so for example if you're calling a restaurant you know presented as i would like to help your customers be able to order food from your restaurant online you know not i want to hire i want you to hire me to do something though presented as here's what i want to do to help you improve your business here's what i want to do to help your customers and i think that's just a in just my personal opinion i think that's a way better way to approach somebody versus um hi i'm a web developer um i'd like to talk about building something for you which says pay me some money whereas let me help your customers says let me help you make more money yeah and i guess you can always pitch it as like look you're gonna make a whole lot more money the money that you're ending up paying me will just be a drop in the bucket compared to the additional business you get uh so so like the benefit to them is going to completely offset any cost to them and and ideally there won't be any risk either right so um how about you phoebe do you have any tips for uh how you in the past to have you how did you find your clients and how that would be different today when we're all under lockdown um yeah i mean it's a hard one because um i did kind of rely more on the facetoface and i think i built a lot of kind of clients through that medium but um you know i guess you can just transfer that to more kind of video conferencing um i mean like it's strange for the younger generation i find that they kind of prefer to be messaged you know kind of like whatsapp and things like that initially um so i i mean i would move it more to kind of having regular meetings but instead of facetoface having the video conferencing using google meet or something like that um but yeah i mean like it's it's kind of in a way it's it's no different um you know you're just using a tool to talk to them but um i think uh if you are going to approach clients like what luke said i think it's you have to approach it the right way you you want to become across as the problem solver and i find that if you do your research on the business it really helps so then it looks like you've put the effort in so you know i always look at it to see if they've got an existing website how can i improve it and then you've kind of you know and usually they kind of appreciate that so kind of not just cold calling said hey i'm a web developer what do you need built you kind of say i've looked into your website i think you can improve this you can improve you know you look at the analytic you know the um you can look at the speed of the website if you can look at you know the accessibility you can go into uh the chrome dev tools and have a look um through lighthouse and you can sort of you know you can do things like that and then approach them so um but yeah i think it's just kind of getting your foot in the door um you know getting them to respond to you and you can and i would say be persistent email you know phone calls you know and and yeah and i say utilize your network as well awesome and balaji how have you found your freelance clients in the past and how would that be different now uh in light of the pandemic okay um so for me i i never really went out to look for clients at the early stages i much more got more referrals than me looking at clients and i never used emails because like emails doesn't work for me i only use emails when i have to like maybe um communicate like send files and all that like i think to go more personal with my clients like check them out and then we have video calls more often than normal and then we have phone calls because that way i can communicate more with them and understand their needs right so i do that a lot i call them and then we chat and then you get to understand okay this is what you want and um just what you need right and that's worked very very effectively for me and like one other thing i would say is trying to build up like your um your portfolio like your your appreciation because at the early stage um no clients will come up to you if they don't see something good enough you've done yeah it's like that's really strange like it's really rare for you to find out like while you're starting out you need to build more stuff because like you get more clients when they see you done more stuff because most often clients would reach out to you either from seeing um your work from somewhere else and then like reach out and like i want the same thing right so try as much as possible to like build up your portfolio like allow your clients to see one or two or three projects you've done that are really sexual and that way you can easily um communicate with them like it's not like saying i do this for this person and this is these are the results from um what i did and then here's what i can do for you also like i'm fully said like um reaching out to them by telling them you want to improve something from their already existing products is an effective way to like get them to use you i know i've reached out some clients and i'm like oh i checked out your website and then it's not really accessible and they're like what's accessibility like i now have an opportunity like to explain to them what it really means and then tell them why they're losing out and why they're losing some clients and then i tell them your images are so large or like your your website is not optimized and they're like what's all that and then i i break it down to them and let them understand why they need to optimize stuff and why their website needs to be accessible right so them understanding those concepts they're not like oh wow like i really didn't think about this right so they now have to like um go to the resources i sent to them when they say okay okay um i'm really interested in this and then how do we go about it it's like i've done two things now i educated them on why they should solve this problem and then i can now come in and say oh now i'm here to solve the problem for you so it's much more than just um using a product for them like it goes beyond just trying to understand the problem that comes from the existing project like luke said also when you understand um what problem they have already based on their existing project you can reach out to them and explain how they can improve it based on your own experience oh no go ahead luke can i add just one thing to all that i mean sure i completely agree if every in this more just of an ad to what everybody just said but the one thing i and to get back to it is in terms of getting business focus on your existing customers first and a lot of people may sound feel like oh i've only got this one customer i've got to go out and get some more and just to give a personal example call it 18 months ago i built an app for a realtor when she was out showing houses to her customers one of her customers uh like the user experience on that and he needed something she referred him to me i built something for him he has since referred me to more people so again that all came from that one project i got for the realtor so it's as crucial as it is to get new business and to how you sell yourself to people the best way to sell yourself to people is by doing a really good job for the people you're already working for that's just the most important part yeah i agree with that yeah i agree and that's an excellent takeaway to end our conference on everybody you heard that right from luke the best way to get new business is to focus on your existing customers dazzle them they will send more business your way definitely resonates with what i've heard and both phoebe and bolaji just agreed with that so uh i want to first of all i just want to thank uh phoebe luke bolaji thank you so much for being on this panel uh your cumulative decades of freelancing experience are extremely helpful and we've learned so much from your insights so thank you for being here for everybody who's still tuning in uh it's been a fourhour long conference this entire conference will be on youtube at this i believe at the same exact url as soon as this ends it'll take a minute we're going to edit out like the breaks and everything you'll have a nice three ish three and a half ish hour video you can watch again you can watch it on double speed if you want you can watch it on your phone while you go for a walk in a uh you know in a safe manner outside um we hope that there's been a lot of insight here uh thank you to everybody who tweeted questions thank you to everybody in chat also i've been reading your uh chat's been super positive i don't think we've had any spam or anybody that's needed to be banned or anything because we put that member paywall up sorry over i mean it's like two dollars or five dollars depending on where you are in the world so i really appreciate uh all the supporting free code camp uh that you know has basically offset the costs associated with this there's one very special person whom i want to thank uh and and uh not just fuzzle who's been incredibly helpful and uh has been an amazing comc here um and it's pretty late in india so i really appreciate you staying up and thank you to your family for tolerating that yeah it's 11 30 and uh i really enjoyed this conference uh quincy thanks for partnering with us and making this happen and thanks for giving us an opportunity to be a part of something like this awesome everybody check out the devblog functionality on hashnote i did it and i wrote an article

there many of the trends we've seen toward automation toward remote work are only going to be accelerated by this pandemic uh this like software development is probably one of the fields that will be least impacted by the pandemic and all the economic destruction and all the lives lost uh so we can be very grateful for that if nothing else so uh one other person recognized chris chris over in
