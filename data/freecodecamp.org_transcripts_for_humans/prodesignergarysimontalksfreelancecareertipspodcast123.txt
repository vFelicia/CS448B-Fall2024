00:02 - [Music]
00:20 - welcome back to the free C Camp podcast
00:22 - I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of
00:24 - freecodecamp.org each week we're talking
00:27 - with developers Founders and ambitious
00:30 - people getting into Tech this week I'm
00:33 - joined by Gary Simon founder of designc
00:36 - course.com
00:38 - designer extraordinaire guitar
00:42 - virtuoso and uh just amazing
00:45 - allaround uh expert on freelancing on
00:50 - web design on using contemporary tools
00:53 - just getting things done and uh he's got
00:56 - like more than a million YouTube
00:58 - subscribers on his channel he's been at
01:00 - this for a very long time and he's
01:02 - carved a path for himself and I think
01:04 - there's a great deal we can learn from
01:05 - him Gary welcome thanks for that awesome
01:09 - intro yeah we're so thrilled to have you
01:11 - here man I'm like I'm a longterm like
01:14 - longtime admirer of the work you do the
01:17 - production of the videos the level of
01:19 - insight uh just you know how it's great
01:23 - watching you do like a tear down of a
01:24 - website and like look at like the
01:27 - different design decisions that were
01:28 - made yeah thanks no know and and the
01:30 - feeling is mutual of course I mean 9
01:32 - million subscribers on YouTube I mean it
01:35 - can't be that so yeah I'm very excited
01:37 - for this uh to have this conversation
01:40 - yeah well I want to start off by just
01:41 - talking like a lot of people have heard
01:43 - the term web design it used to be the
01:44 - main term that people talk about in
01:46 - terms of getting things on the web now
01:49 - you heard the term web development but
01:51 - the but web design and web development
01:52 - are kind of two distinct disciplines
01:55 - that you know web design still exists
01:57 - it's it's completely different set of
01:58 - skills right right right so like back in
02:01 - the day when I started maybe we started
02:04 - uh you know was like in the early '90s
02:07 - to to late 90s and I we had the term Web
02:10 - Master back then so I was like a web
02:12 - master I think and I think that's I
02:14 - think that that's the term I used I call
02:15 - myself a Web Master even though yeah and
02:17 - I was I was doing design and code back
02:19 - then but I for me yeah a web designer
02:23 - the way I give that definition it's
02:25 - essentially somebody who's dealing
02:27 - mainly with the Aesthetics uh and if to
02:30 - to break that down more specifically you
02:32 - could say UI ux designer um for me web
02:36 - development is a is a term that would
02:38 - could possibly include web design or
02:41 - like the design aspect depending on who
02:43 - you ask but uh for me if I'm talking
02:45 - about development I'm I'm probably
02:46 - talking about front end development and
02:48 - and backend and stuff like that yeah
02:50 - Okay cool so
02:53 - Aesthetics how would you define
02:55 - Aesthetics and uh as like like let's
02:58 - pretend okay okay there are probably a
03:00 - lot of people listening to this who
03:02 - don't even have you know the faculty of
03:05 - site like we have a lot of blind people
03:06 - in the free cocing community like how
03:08 - would you describe Aesthetics well
03:12 - unless I'm wrong about the definition of
03:14 - Aesthetics I you for me it would be uh
03:18 - the the visual aspect of building you
03:20 - know a digital project like a website or
03:22 - an app or a SAS you know and so the the
03:24 - tools for that for me would be figma
03:27 - perhaps I so when I say aesthetic even
03:30 - when I'm referring to like bodybuilding
03:32 - I'm saying what does that look like so
03:34 - for me if I'm talking about the
03:35 - Aesthetics of a website I I'm talking
03:37 - about the visual aspect um I'm not sure
03:40 - if that is consistent with the correct
03:42 - definition uh because I know you you you
03:44 - precluded that by individuals who can't
03:47 - you know who can't see or have a hard
03:49 - time you know seeing a website but
03:51 - that's that's how I traditionally have
03:53 - approached that that definition yeah
03:55 - that makes a lot of sense how did you
03:57 - build up your sense of Aesthetics over
03:59 - the years um right so so um I've been
04:03 - designing for a real long time and I've
04:05 - always been artistic I like to draw as a
04:07 - kid you know not to say that you have to
04:09 - be artistic for UI design uh because you
04:12 - don't have to be but for me um you know
04:15 - I've always you know we could talk about
04:17 - this a little bit more down the road but
04:19 - you know in in the late mid to late 90s
04:22 - I I was just fascinated by early
04:24 - computer Graphics back then like
04:26 - Photoshop 2.0 had these lightning bolt
04:28 - strikes and stuff and I in terms of
04:31 - developing my current taste and how it's
04:34 - transformed over years and such uh
04:37 - that's just a matter of experience you
04:39 - know once you start playing around with
04:40 - things and Building Things designing
04:42 - things you'll develop your own sense of
04:45 - what makes you tick you know I'm a big
04:47 - fan of like minimalism but also sci-fi
04:50 - and so I that I kind of work that
04:53 - sometimes we're appropriate but that I
04:55 - like that sort of stuff just kind of
04:56 - like we all have our own musical tastes
04:58 - you know in terms of we can also have
05:00 - our taste as well awesome yeah well
05:04 - let's you know let's talk about that
05:05 - early those early experiences oh yeah
05:08 - with computers because I I know you're
05:10 - like a big fan of kind of like retro
05:13 - Computing Aesthetics and uh you know
05:16 - there's a great video that I'm going to
05:17 - link to in the show notes I'll be
05:19 - linking to a lot of the things that Gary
05:21 - brings up during this conversation but
05:24 - uh it's it's like right before the year
05:26 - 2020 and it's just Gary uh jamming out
05:30 - on the guitar with this really cool kind
05:32 - of like uh I I mean if anybody's seen
05:36 - the movie Kung Fury like it's just got
05:38 - that kind of like Dusty smoke fil dark
05:42 - kind of like school computer yeah yeah
05:45 - yeah it's great yeah yeah I can't wait
05:48 - to utilize the new studio to do more
05:50 - crazy stuff but but yeah we'll talk
05:52 - about that but yeah how I got started
05:56 - with computers yeah I mean you grew up
05:58 - in Ohio
06:00 - yes yeah which is in the middle of
06:02 - America pretty much like it's
06:05 - Northeastern it's it's right under it's
06:07 - right attached to the Great Lakes Lake
06:08 - Erie and yeah yeah so like a lot of
06:12 - people have probably not been out there
06:14 - like I've never been there it's it's
06:17 - what is it like is it like uh you know
06:19 - it's just like a it's a rural you know
06:21 - and I've only lived like within a a 10
06:23 - mile radius my entire life I've probably
06:25 - been four or five places but I it's it's
06:28 - very like where I live now I it's like I
06:31 - have a horse farm across the street my
06:33 - neighbors are far away I have eight
06:35 - Acres that's that's that's what we like
06:38 - my wife and I um we did live in the city
06:41 - and it of course it's not a big city
06:42 - there's like 36,000 people there um but
06:45 - people were just close together and I I
06:47 - like having space you know and that was
06:50 - kind of how I grew up as well early on
06:52 - yeah yeah well as I uh as listeners to
06:56 - the show know I grew up in Oklahoma City
06:58 - and it it is similar like in it's just
07:00 - like less dense right yeah you would
07:03 - drive on your way to school you might
07:05 - drive by right an actual Farm oh yeah
07:08 - yeah yeah I run past them all the time
07:11 - yeah so um maybe you can talk about
07:14 - those early days like what you were into
07:16 - as a kid I mean you mentioned you drew a
07:18 - lot yeah I was into art um I was also
07:22 - into baseball you know I was a pitcher
07:24 - and I I went I I played all the way up
07:26 - until about e8th grade and I stopped
07:28 - because I became too obsessed with
07:30 - computers um and so yeah I ran and I you
07:34 - know I was athletic and and then I
07:37 - wasn't because the computers took over
07:39 - yeah uh and and my first introduction to
07:42 - computers was uh my friend actually he
07:45 - showed me AOL um on his computer I
07:48 - didn't we didn't have a home computer
07:50 - and I was like what is this and it was
07:51 - dial up we didn't have cable modem back
07:53 - then and I just thought it was amazing
07:55 - those private rooms everybody's talking
07:57 - with each other so I begged my parents
07:58 - for a computer
08:00 - and they bought me a nice computer it
08:02 - was like $2,000 back then and I and and
08:05 - I started getting into that and then I
08:07 - started playing Doom I my sister's
08:09 - boyfriend brought over the five you know
08:12 - hard diss of Doom to install Doom the
08:14 - floppy disc you had they had this cool
08:16 - like Doss in your face where it would
08:18 - show the progress bar and so I played
08:20 - that and then I I I realized you can
08:22 - actually make levels and so that's my
08:24 - very first taste of any type of
08:26 - development creating things on the
08:28 - computer was making Doom too levels it
08:30 - had their own little apps and stuff and
08:32 - it was complex too it was hard and and
08:35 - um and then I got into uh AOL a bit more
08:39 - um creating programs pries as they were
08:41 - called The Very irritating things that
08:44 - where you could kick people offline and
08:46 - freeze their computer and like I just
08:48 - thought that was the funnest thing to do
08:49 - to my friends and in order to do that
08:52 - you had to learn Visual Basic and and
08:54 - that is my first step into actual
08:55 - development of any sort and that's
08:58 - hardcore I desktop development and you I
09:01 - had to learn it and and I learned a
09:04 - Visual Basic API programming and it it
09:07 - was just something that a 13 14
09:08 - year-old's doing it's like what is
09:10 - happening I and I learned a lot from
09:12 - that yes I learned a lot from that CU
09:15 - basically these little pries as they
09:17 - were called or prags I they they were
09:20 - separate desktop applications that you
09:22 - ran on your computer and you click
09:25 - buttons and it would literally control
09:27 - the interface of AOL
09:29 - so if you had a friend screen name and
09:31 - they were online right now and you
09:33 - wanted to like freeze their computer you
09:34 - could send like this IM spam to them
09:36 - automatically and it just froze their
09:38 - computer and like we just thought it was
09:39 - hilarious uh but in doing that and being
09:42 - you know a terribly annoying teenager I
09:46 - I learned how to code actually and I
09:48 - liked it it was fun um and challenging I
09:52 - shortly after that is when I started oh
09:54 - designing web pages and and that's that
09:56 - was kind of that I left that stuff
09:58 - behind fortunately
10:00 - I and I got into designing web pages
10:02 - yeah yeah I remember back in the day I
10:04 - think my friend had something called AO
10:06 - hell oh
10:07 - yes little scripts that you could use to
10:10 - like troll people about five six years
10:12 - ago I did a video kind of showing all
10:15 - the old AOL prags as they are called um
10:18 - and yeah trip down memory lane the
10:21 - designs of these UI are just horrendous
10:23 - it's hilarious but I that's how we
10:25 - learned back then yeah well um let's
10:28 - talk about like just so you you've
10:31 - abandoned baseball uh and just gone deep
10:35 - into the underworld of trolling people
10:37 - on AOL building Doom wads if I recall
10:41 - correctly wads yeah wad files awesome
10:43 - and and man like the degree of artistic
10:47 - expression within that game it was just
10:49 - incredible I saw the most incredible
10:51 - mods for Doom cuz I played the heck out
10:54 - of Doom I I remember like I believe the
10:57 - only time I did I actually like ate up
10:59 - like more than one day without sleep was
11:02 - when I first got the Doom
11:04 - shareware uh and I just remember walking
11:07 - around and just being like this is
11:09 - incredible for like I don't think I
11:11 - slept for like two days yeah had I was
11:14 - having so much fun the book was like
11:16 - this thick of like how to make Doom
11:18 - levels it was amazing like there was it
11:21 - was such a fascinating world and I was
11:22 - never good like really good it was just
11:24 - a young kid doing it I but I knew then I
11:28 - was like this is so exciting just
11:29 - creating stuff on a computer you know
11:31 - and that's what got me into it um and
11:34 - like I said then then the web page stuff
11:36 - came along and we're talking about like
11:37 - front page 97 or front page 98 microft
11:41 - like you don't need to learn HTML or css
11:43 - anymore yeah is that funny thinking at
11:45 - the time yeah yeah yeah and I didn't you
11:48 - know I I didn't know HTML CSS not I
11:51 - never typed in a notepad I my friend
11:53 - locally did I was like you're hardcore
11:55 - you know I I didn't do that stuff I you
11:58 - know I'm talking about like 99 98 99
12:00 - 2000 or so mhm and and so I used front
12:03 - page 98 and then um and then we switch I
12:06 - upgraded my workflow to uh back then it
12:10 - was macr media Dream Weaver I think yes
12:12 - and uh Adobe of course bought them a
12:14 - while later but macr media Dream Weaver
12:17 - uh my workflow for designing websites
12:21 - used to look like this they use Adobe
12:22 - photosop to design it think of that like
12:25 - as the old school figma yeah except it
12:27 - was never meant for designing website
12:29 - interfaces but that's what people did
12:31 - that's all we had uh so you design your
12:34 - mockup in that first your website mockup
12:37 - and then you would step into Adobe
12:40 - fireworks which may have been a
12:41 - macromedia product as well I I forget
12:44 - and fireworks you import that and then
12:47 - you do your slices so you kind of cut up
12:49 - with this slice tool again there's no
12:52 - programming here or coding at all H and
12:54 - you slice it up and then you hit export
12:57 - and it would export your website for you
13:00 - in these sliced frames and then you take
13:02 - it into something like Dream Weaver and
13:04 - then you would have to kind of fine-tune
13:07 - it uh so that it makes sense on a
13:09 - website and not everything is image
13:10 - slices right if that makes sense so
13:13 - there was a whole workflow and that I
13:14 - did that for a while as well yeah I mean
13:17 - like early 2000s if you go back and look
13:19 - at like the early Coca-Cola website uh
13:22 - or other Big Brand websites they had
13:25 - pretty elaborate looking websites way
13:27 - even way back in like the late '90s
13:29 - early 2000s but they were a lot of
13:32 - images everywhere right they have this
13:34 - really cool typography but it's really
13:36 - just like a little Fir and they were all
13:40 - and when these tools like fireworks
13:42 - would export your your page it was all
13:45 - structured and scaffolded by tables HTML
13:48 - table the element so everything was
13:51 - based on tables back then we didn't have
13:53 - like divs and stuff yeah U so it was
13:55 - interesting and and you had your white
13:57 - space controlled by the cbls by the
14:00 - thickness of the cells and all this it
14:02 - was interesting entirely different way
14:04 - you know different times in terms of how
14:05 - we approach design you know right now
14:08 - but even in doing that I still was
14:10 - developing my sense for UI design
14:13 - because that's timeless it was all the
14:14 - same concept you're just designing for
14:16 - one screen size essentially like 800 by
14:18 - 600 back then it was Tiny um and so yeah
14:22 - even even those very early days still
14:25 - probably impact what I do today in some
14:28 - weird way yeah yeah uh that's
14:30 - interesting to hear that like even
14:31 - though the tools have changed a whole
14:33 - lot the uh considerations uh I mean
14:36 - using the web is just 100 times better
14:37 - of a user experience in 2024 than it was
14:41 - back then in the sense that everything
14:42 - is like you go to a website you get up
14:44 - you go pour a cup of coffee or something
14:46 - because it's going to take a while for
14:48 - like all the assets to
14:50 - load you have to be careful about what
14:52 - you click on because you go to a
14:54 - different web page and you have to wait
14:55 - for things to load right yeah and go
14:58 - ahead I was just going to say the
14:59 - aesthetic back in like the the there
15:01 - used to be like these portal websites
15:03 - like Yahoo which I believe still exists
15:05 - U where you would it's just a giant list
15:08 - of everything on one page because they
15:10 - know like right like page load takes a
15:13 - long time and like every click is kind
15:15 - of like Precious so like let's put
15:17 - everything right in front of and to this
15:18 - day if you look at like a lot of Chinese
15:20 - websites a lot of Japanese websites they
15:22 - are incredibly like content dense
15:24 - compared to like you know us websites
15:28 - right right yeah and we had some bad
15:30 - practices too early on like a lot of us
15:33 - we were doing Splash Pages you know we
15:35 - just had a splash page for your
15:37 - portfolio some type of interesting
15:39 - graphic you made in Photoshop enter here
15:41 - and you click enter here it's like the
15:43 - most unnecessary thing now we still have
15:45 - that on some of these even Awards like
15:47 - winning websites uh but fortunately
15:50 - that's not the de facto and and a lot of
15:53 - people did that you know a lot of our
15:55 - startup web designers like click here to
15:57 - enter it's your splash page you know you
15:58 - got to have the splash page it's like no
16:00 - you
16:01 - don't but but then we also had flash
16:03 - around the same time and Flash was real
16:06 - interesting because you know like you
16:08 - said the big companies they knew I what
16:11 - you were talking what you were just
16:12 - talking about we need to get people the
16:13 - information fast but back then if you
16:16 - were a teenager you wanted glitzy crazy
16:19 - Graphics you wanted crazy animations and
16:22 - that's what we took advantage of with
16:24 - flash uh and Flash you know for those of
16:26 - you who aren't watching maybe you're too
16:28 - young it was just uh it was a really fun
16:31 - way to create animated interactive
16:34 - websites uh and you could do some really
16:36 - cool things with flash like special
16:39 - graphics and effects that was just
16:41 - groundbreaking back then um and so in
16:44 - one way looking back on it you know we
16:47 - were approaching it probably the wrong
16:48 - way I a lot of us aspiring designers
16:51 - back then because we were really just
16:53 - probably utilizing way too much page
16:55 - load time because of the dialup modems
16:58 - like they didn't not afford you you know
17:00 - a lot of room to work with and so you
17:02 - had to be careful with all those the
17:04 - audio clicks on the UI you know you
17:07 - click a button you want to sound Ur you
17:09 - know it's like all this stuff was just
17:10 - taking way too way too long to load
17:12 - essentially yeah uh so that's something
17:14 - we had to grow up out of yeah well was
17:16 - there a period so this is one thing that
17:19 - I'm interested in we've got so much to
17:20 - talk about but was there a period where
17:23 - people enough people had Broadband that
17:25 - you could have like really fancy splashy
17:27 - websites before rise of like mobile
17:29 - phones and then you had to like think
17:31 - about okay people are going to be
17:32 - consuming this on a phone too was there
17:33 - like some specific period where people
17:36 - could just go Hog Wild and like build
17:38 - any kind of crazy website and was was
17:41 - there that kind of period of I don't
17:43 - have I don't have that sense of there
17:45 - being a specific time frame like that I
17:47 - do know I waited for a long time for
17:51 - cable modem you know like Fast cable
17:53 - based internet speed to come to my area
17:56 - and the area that I noticed the biggest
17:58 - like factor for that was gaming when I
18:01 - was playing Quake 2 so I played Quake 2
18:03 - like for like 10 years the same game
18:05 - Quake 2 multiplayer and when I would
18:08 - shoot the rocket launcher on dialup I
18:11 - had to aim like in the virtual world
18:15 - like 10 feet ahead of the person yeah
18:18 - and because it would just take time it
18:20 - was a big lag uh but then when you got
18:22 - the cable mode and and your my my ping
18:25 - was like 215 back then that would be
18:27 - like a great that would be a great ping
18:29 - and then we got the cable modem and it
18:31 - was like 32 sometimes it was the biggest
18:33 - difference now of course that was a huge
18:35 - difference with the web as well um but
18:38 - for me I kind of don't really recall
18:40 - that time I I was slower on the uptake
18:43 - with mobile development like when the
18:45 - iPhone came out I I I kind of just
18:48 - waited it not not intentionally I just
18:50 - kind of never got involved with the
18:53 - early adopters of um mobile design uh
18:57 - cuz it was just so new and I didn't
18:59 - really you know I didn't really consider
19:01 - that very much yeah well um in terms of
19:06 - what you did with those skills as you
19:08 - were you're you're a teenager you're
19:11 - into building Doom Maps you're into
19:14 - building designs with uh some of these
19:18 - primordial tools Photoshop fireworks
19:22 - dream waver getting things live on the
19:24 - internet without even necessarily
19:25 - needing to know the HTML and CSS that of
19:27 - course like timately everybody has to
19:30 - learn you know when performance
19:32 - accessibility all these other things you
19:33 - don't necessarily want to hand that over
19:36 - to a tool right so right maybe you can
19:39 - talk about like where you went from
19:40 - there in terms of what the next few
19:43 - years of your life were like like right
19:45 - you went to you did you finish high
19:47 - school and where you went from there
19:49 - right so yeah once I hit High
19:52 - School um that's when you know the I I
19:56 - forget it was the counselor in the high
19:58 - school they they talk to every kid and
20:00 - they're like okay what are your plans
20:01 - you know do you want to go to college
20:02 - and my parents were old school and they
20:05 - just you know they didn't grow up with a
20:07 - rich family so they were old they didn't
20:09 - realize loans existed so they always
20:11 - told me and my my siblings I have a
20:13 - brother and sister who are older I
20:15 - you're not going to college you know
20:16 - that you're not going to be able to
20:17 - afford that we can't afford that you
20:19 - know so you know you're on your own you
20:21 - know go to like a technical school or
20:22 - something like that and I was like well
20:24 - you know what I I really like computers
20:26 - and I know I can make a living from this
20:28 - and back then like in high school early
20:30 - High School the way I made money is I
20:33 - would do these design contests that
20:35 - these Web Master forms would put on so
20:38 - design contests are a thing that uh
20:40 - actually still exists today this day um
20:42 - and they were I think probably more
20:44 - popular back in the day but like 99
20:46 - designs.com is one of them um that's a
20:49 - modern example but yeah I would do
20:51 - design contest that people would have on
20:52 - forums um like design this logo winner
20:55 - gets $300 and you know so I would get
20:57 - $300 here and maybe design a landing
21:00 - page or something like that and get $800
21:03 - here it's very sparse you know being in
21:05 - in high school and actually one time um
21:08 - to back up a little bit I think I was in
21:11 - seventh or eth grade and I got a job
21:13 - offer from a software company in Fort
21:16 - Knox um for because I was helping this
21:19 - guy with AOL API Visual Basic
21:23 - programming it never worked out because
21:25 - they were going to pay me a $30 an hour
21:27 - but they're human resources wouldn't
21:29 - allow it cuz I was just too young and so
21:32 - that you know that experience and then
21:34 - making a little bit of money online
21:36 - that's I was like I'm I'm going to
21:37 - finish high school but I'm not going to
21:38 - college because it's just I didn't know
21:40 - otherwise and I'm glad that actually
21:42 - happened in the long run um because I
21:45 - didn't have all those bills and it did
21:47 - work out in the end yeah and that's four
21:49 - years you got to spend in Industry that
21:50 - you would have SP right right and so
21:53 - parties or something I don't know do in
21:54 - college so then I I graduated and at
21:57 - that point I'm not making any type of
21:58 - consistent you know normal amount of
22:00 - money unfortunately my parents weren't
22:02 - the type like you're 18 you have to get
22:03 - out so I stayed I lived with them until
22:07 - I was 23 um and that whole time I had
22:09 - this girlfriend and we got engaged and
22:12 - so I when we got married I moved out
22:14 - like that same day it's like a a very
22:16 - traditional thing it just worked out
22:18 - that way but all the way up until that
22:20 - point like I was about 23 I wasn't
22:22 - making any consistent money I was very
22:24 - worried I was like I have to leave soon
22:26 - I'm not making good money I don't want
22:27 - to work for some somebody else because
22:29 - my father he had always been
22:31 - self-employed and what did he do yeah so
22:34 - he he all he did and and he actually
22:36 - still just did it here recently after
22:39 - three Strokes by the way I he he
22:41 - serviced washers and dryers and also
22:44 - sell he sold used washers and dryers and
22:47 - so it doesn't sound glamorous at all but
22:49 - he was making like for a while when he
22:51 - was really established like you know
22:53 - $10,000 months which is a lot of money
22:56 - back then yeah and and so all the greed
22:59 - flation of 2022 like in the 80s $10,000
23:04 - a month is like the equivalent of like
23:05 - $30,000 a month oh yeah yeah it's crazy
23:08 - yeah very very solid income so he and
23:10 - and he didn't it was rare that he hit
23:13 - that number mean usually I think it was
23:14 - like six or 7,000 a month but you know
23:16 - having seen that and also having this
23:18 - idea even if it was false that I can't
23:20 - go to college that it BW a fire under my
23:24 - butt but I realized it was hard to like
23:26 - figure out how am I going to make it in
23:28 - a free Lance context you know and um it
23:32 - it how I ended up actually making my
23:34 - first like my establishing a real career
23:37 - out of this was purely by accident you
23:40 - know I was um dig.com um I'm not sure if
23:43 - you're familiar
23:45 - with. y Reddit precursor yes and it's
23:49 - basically a social one of the first if
23:51 - not the first social book marking type
23:53 - site um I'm not sure if it was but it
23:56 - was real popular back then and if you
23:58 - made it to the if your article or your
24:00 - content made it to the front page of
24:01 - dig.com you were getting thousands of
24:03 - visitors to your website and so I
24:06 - remember thinking in my my wedding is
24:08 - six months away and I'm not making
24:11 - consistent money yet at all and like I
24:13 - wouldn't be able to afford our our rent
24:15 - for our apartment or whatever well I
24:18 - decided I like I'm going to rate a
24:19 - tutorial just to see if I can get hit
24:21 - front page dig.com and it was it was one
24:23 - of the worst tutorials ever how to
24:25 - design an awesome logo and it hit from
24:29 - page dig.com and I I got all these
24:32 - thousands like 13,000 visitors or
24:34 - something and I wasn't selling anything
24:35 - there was no monetization and you know I
24:37 - was like okay that's cool and then like
24:39 - five months later I just randomly check
24:41 - my website stats and I'm getting like a
24:43 - thousand visitors per day like where's
24:45 - this coming from and it was Google and
24:47 - so back then if you ranked very well on
24:49 - dig.com other websites were linked to
24:51 - you so it had a natural like SEO effect
24:54 - yeah where I I'm ranking like literally
24:57 - number one number two number three for
24:59 - like how to design a logo how to create
25:00 - a logo how to make a logo and so I
25:02 - thought to myself wait okay so I'm
25:05 - showing in this one really long like
25:07 - written tutorial how to make a logo most
25:09 - people realize they're not going to be
25:10 - able to so I sold I I made my own
25:13 - backend because I understood I PHP and
25:16 - and MySQL and stuff I made my own
25:19 - backend I and people could just click
25:21 - this Banner like hey I'll design your
25:23 - logo for you if you're not competent or
25:25 - something like that and the way I did it
25:28 - is I didn't want to talk to clients so I
25:31 - built a entire order system and there
25:33 - was an intake form for for the project
25:36 - um and I charged $75 for One logo design
25:40 - concept and that was it um and once I
25:42 - put that Banner on that that page I got
25:47 - basically one order per day I averaged
25:49 - so there I go and I just started a
25:51 - career by accident and of course over
25:54 - the next 5 to seven years I was doing
25:57 - primary
25:58 - primarily logo and identity designs
26:01 - essentially and I had to masked about
26:03 - 2,000 clients and I I I increased the
26:06 - the price up to like 300 um which you
26:09 - know I would have done things
26:11 - differently if I had the information I
26:12 - know now but I and then of course those
26:16 - people needed websites as well U some of
26:18 - them and so I would um offer a service
26:22 - where they could have a website design
26:25 - designed for them like like a Photoshop
26:27 - like a mockup for like $600 and and so
26:30 - that's how I started making money and
26:32 - fortunately right when I moved out I was
26:33 - making enough money and then I started
26:35 - making more and we could talk about you
26:37 - know what I did thereafter but that's
26:39 - how I kind of got started from okay
26:40 - being a teenager who's has some skills
26:43 - but not sure how to make money um into
26:46 - what was essentially an accident I and
26:48 - that lasted for five to seven years
26:50 - before the algorithm and those that that
26:52 - page eventually stopped you know
26:55 - receiving as much traffic yeah so I mean
26:58 - $300 a design you said you're getting
27:00 - like around one client per day 2,000
27:03 - clients like that's a lot of work it is
27:05 - insane and you know what's interesting
27:07 - is
27:08 - I traditionally people think you know if
27:11 - you're a freelancer you have to you have
27:13 - to talk with the client you have to have
27:14 - meetings with the clients and stuff and
27:16 - if you're at a certain price point um
27:19 - and and I I know I think his name is
27:21 - Brett from design Joy he has this
27:24 - similar approach and I know there's a
27:27 - lot of controversy around you know him
27:29 - and his business or whatever but that
27:31 - certainly can work where you don't have
27:35 - to necessarily talk to the clients
27:36 - before they actually pay you uh so it it
27:39 - really comes down to having a really
27:41 - good landing page um that's effective on
27:43 - all fronts and uh you you can actually
27:46 - you know make a living by not having to
27:49 - deal with the client aspect as long as
27:51 - if you have really good intake form um
27:54 - and I did I was able to find tune Bine
27:55 - to get to get the information that I
27:58 - needed out of the client essentially so
28:00 - they would order fill out the form I it
28:03 - would tell them there's a weight period
28:04 - And I would design it and they would see
28:07 - it and then offer feedback like like if
28:10 - they're Happ like they could request a
28:11 - revision if they want for x amount and
28:14 - if they we would have a back and forth
28:15 - with like a little comment system and
28:18 - most clients were really cool most
28:19 - clients I was able to satisfy within one
28:21 - to two revisions and then of course you
28:23 - have your outliers that uh were
28:26 - nightmares to deal with after you know
28:28 - of course if you're dealing with that
28:29 - bulk of clients you're going to have
28:31 - terrible clients that you you deal with
28:33 - and at that point you just kind of
28:34 - refund them and just you know I'm sorry
28:36 - I can't but that was very few and far
28:38 - between so it worked very well yeah wow
28:42 - so uh that's that's really good Insight
28:44 - like in terms of kind of productizing
28:46 - your services right uh essentially
28:50 - getting it to where you've got a system
28:52 - in place that is not necessarily one
28:54 - size fit all but one size fits most so
28:57 - that yes there are people who are just
28:59 - incompatible with the way you want to
29:00 - get things done right and uh your time's
29:03 - too valuable to you know try to work
29:06 - with every client and make everything a
29:07 - success so you just give them the money
29:09 - back right and part ways and focus on
29:12 - the people that you can help and it
29:13 - doesn't sound like you had any shortage
29:15 - of people that wanted your help no no I
29:18 - I mean that website you know I I I I
29:21 - replicated that success with that
29:23 - article with a with one called how to
29:24 - design a website and so I actually ended
29:27 - up ranking for number one number two
29:29 - number three for those typee of keywords
29:30 - as well and so yeah I was making over
29:33 - well over 100,000 a year um for you know
29:37 - a good couple two or three years um and
29:39 - that was B basically from 2007 2006 to
29:43 - like 2012 2013 or so and so I was doing
29:47 - web design for clients all exclusive
29:49 - work I my only tutorial was that
29:51 - tutorial that I wrote you know and then
29:54 - my very first YouTube video was on 2010
29:56 - and that was just for the fun of it
29:58 - um I didn't take YouTube seriously until
30:01 - about 2014 but we might be skipping
30:03 - ahead a little bit too much but yeah
30:05 - well let's step back and kind of like
30:07 - unpack some of the things that you just
30:09 - said so you're you didn't go to college
30:12 - uh you don't have to worry about paying
30:14 - back student debt uh you've lived very
30:16 - economically it sounds like staying with
30:18 - your parents until you got married you
30:19 - got married pretty young like I did I
30:21 - think I was like 20 five maybe when I
30:23 - got married okay so uh and so you've
30:26 - just got this kind of like
30:28 - and and also you didn't move to like a
30:30 - big expensive city like a lot of people
30:32 - do when they're young uh you just kind
30:34 - of stayed around well I I'll tell you
30:37 - why and and basically I think it was a
30:40 - year after we got married I my wife got
30:45 - pregnant and we realized you know we
30:49 - can't move from our family you know
30:50 - they're too much help yeah absolutely so
30:53 - like there was so much help and our
30:55 - firstborn was you know she was is still
30:58 - you know our our our trying child you
31:01 - know it requires all of our energy so I
31:03 - we had tremendous help here locally and
31:05 - like just you know better weather is it
31:09 - did not supersede having help from
31:11 - family and now we're just here you know
31:13 - we really love our our property so we
31:15 - don't feel like moving so awesome yeah
31:17 - well you're one of the first people I've
31:19 - interviewed on the show who like lives
31:20 - out in the open I think you said you
31:22 - have like seven acres which is uh for
31:26 - anyone outside of the US I'm not going
31:28 - to attempt to convert that into hectares
31:30 - but it's a lot it's a lot of space like
31:32 - I think this house this is a very
31:33 - standard uh you know Texas you know
31:36 - house uh I think it's it occupies maybe
31:39 - like a a quarter of an acre okay you
31:42 - know so the property that was our house
31:44 - before this in the city yeah yeah it was
31:47 - real small and um but you know I started
31:49 - to become more successful and like we
31:51 - just had to get a bigger place cuz we
31:53 - were in like a I think it was like a
31:54 - 12200 foot like house at that time then
31:58 - we moved here about three or four years
31:59 - ago and it's a lot better yeah yeah yeah
32:03 - actually this might be like an eighth of
32:04 - an acre it's it's pretty small uh we do
32:06 - have a backyard uh and one of the things
32:08 - I want to talk about real quick while
32:09 - we're talking about houses and
32:10 - backyards you were on the path of the
32:15 - eclipse uh that happened here in the
32:17 - United States this week as a recording
32:19 - uh today is April 10th when we're
32:21 - recording this uh just just two days ago
32:24 - there was a cosmic event that only
32:28 - happens at least in Dallas once every
32:29 - 300 years or so um yes it was cool yeah
32:34 - we we ran at a cabin uh it's about 25
32:36 - minutes away from here to and my wife
32:39 - and my mom like they've been planning
32:41 - this for like 5 years since like we had
32:43 - a partial one in 2017 uh so theyve been
32:46 - gung-ho over it you know and I saw it
32:48 - and it was it was really cool it was
32:50 - cooler than I thought it would be um
32:52 - just to look up and like you see that
32:54 - perfect little ring there I it was very
32:56 - cool yeah the cricket started chirping
32:59 - in the middle of the day because it got
33:00 - dark it was really cool because we were
33:02 - up next to a lake it was it was so cool
33:05 - yeah we just watched it from our
33:06 - backyard and like all our LED yard
33:08 - lights came on yeah which is really
33:10 - funny cuz they're all like you know uh
33:13 - now we're planning we're planning on
33:15 - going um in 2044 to North or South
33:18 - Dakota because that's the next total
33:20 - eclipse I guess 204 20 20 years away
33:24 - yeah if you go to South Dakota or North
33:26 - Dakota that's why my wife said is that
33:28 - otherwise here
33:29 - 2099 so I'm not sure if I'm going to be
33:31 - able to live that long I'd be 116 yeah
33:34 - that'd be uh you can hold that I was
33:36 - like man I like the eclipse so much
33:38 - think I'm just going to chill in my
33:39 - backyard for the next 300 years and
33:41 - catch the next one right but yeah like
33:44 - it it was how did how did it make you
33:47 - feel no it was cool I had my family
33:49 - around me um and it was really cool you
33:52 - know I we had our glasses you know our
33:55 - little glasses and and I
33:58 - yeah it it was awesome
34:00 - I I did I didn't make a huge big deal
34:03 - about it as much as my you know I think
34:05 - it it it really inspired my wife and my
34:07 - family a little bit more than me but I
34:09 - knew it's just it's just the moon going
34:11 - in front of the sun it is cool though
34:13 - yeah and the fact that they can pinpoint
34:15 - the pr you know accuracy and know
34:17 - exactly where it's at as people in NASA
34:20 - yeah it's really impressive uh technical
34:22 - Fe being able to predict these things
34:24 - right uh given how complex you know
34:27 - orbits are and everything right right
34:30 - yeah but yeah well so you've got this I
34:35 - mean you're in a very you know enviable
34:39 - position having all this freelance
34:41 - business coming in you're not
34:42 - necessarily I mean you do Marketing in
34:44 - the form of publishing these tutorials
34:46 - that generate SEO uh essentially that
34:49 - generate inbound leads but yes you're
34:52 - not out there having to like pound the
34:54 - pavement and sell yourself sell clients
34:57 - on like hey uh I'm Gary Simon and I can
35:00 - do web design for you I can do what you
35:02 - need me to do you know like people are
35:03 - coming to you that's amazing right and
35:07 - so and I I really that was great that I
35:10 - had that win um but I knew in just just
35:14 - in the back of my mind but I didn't act
35:16 - on it and this is just being young and
35:18 - it was a it was a very difficult lesson
35:20 - to learn is that you can't get
35:22 - complacent especially with anything
35:24 - dealing with internet and Technology
35:25 - because it moves fast um and so I
35:28 - remember I was out there playing tennis
35:30 - this one day I was thinking to myself if
35:32 - man if you know if if I stop getting
35:34 - orders and and Google stops sending me
35:36 - traffic I'm going to be in a bad place
35:39 - you know because I have this $1,400
35:41 - mortgage we just moved into this nice
35:43 - place my second daughter was just born
35:45 - and I sure enough you know Google made
35:48 - some changes to their algorithm and I
35:51 - only had those two pages like I didn't
35:53 - keep making content that was such a
35:55 - stupid idea and I just took it for
35:57 - granted that I would just rank forever
36:00 - and slow enough over about a six-month
36:02 - period you know my income went from like
36:05 - making you know like 10,000 a month down
36:08 - to like you know 4,000 3,000 and it was
36:13 - such a bad time and that was what was
36:16 - that that was about 11 years ago 11 12
36:18 - years ago and um and so I took up you
36:21 - know I I started drinking a lot and like
36:24 - I we had to move out of our house cuz we
36:26 - couldn't afford it damn damn you had to
36:28 - like give up your house yes and so we
36:30 - moved to you to the city into a much
36:33 - smaller place more manageable uh house
36:35 - payment um my wife went back to work as
36:38 - a register nurse part-time I so that was
36:42 - a real big wakeup call for me that was
36:44 - like okay you knew this was going to
36:46 - happen like nothing lasts forever why
36:48 - were you just you know being complacent
36:50 - you know and that's the biggest that's a
36:52 - big takeaway that still applies today
36:54 - probably in any I aspect of a business
36:58 - any type of business um but especially
37:00 - if you're a freelancer if you're not
37:02 - doing enough to push yourself out there
37:04 - continually and and promote yourself and
37:06 - try to diversify the ways in which
37:08 - you're able to to make money I after a
37:12 - while you might have like a run for five
37:14 - years consider yourself lucky if if
37:16 - you're able to just kind of like
37:17 - maintain the status quo for five years
37:19 - um doing nothing essentially because
37:22 - that was me I was I was doing something
37:24 - by working with my clients but I
37:28 - the new leads weren't coming in because
37:29 - the traffic was dropping and so I I had
37:32 - to make some decisions at that
37:34 - point yeah well uh that's like a nice um
37:39 - terrible Parable uh as as I like to
37:42 - always tell my friends who are in SEO
37:44 - you know we always say live by the
37:46 - Google die by the Google right right
37:50 - yeah it's amazing when it's working and
37:52 - but when it's not it's like oh myy yeah
37:54 - absolutely uh and and certainly I I
37:57 - think you've learned a lot from that and
38:00 - you now got this very distributed kind
38:02 - of like multifaceted approach toward
38:05 - business um and you know I'd like to
38:08 - talk more autobiographically but maybe
38:10 - you could talk about what your your
38:13 - setup looks like today how you're
38:15 - bringing in clients uh before we get
38:17 - into the nitty-gritty of working with
38:19 - clients because there are going to be a
38:20 - lot of practical takeaways I just want
38:22 - to understand what you learned how you
38:24 - applied those learnings and what you
38:26 - know design course what Gary Simon uh
38:29 - Incorporated looks like today right so
38:32 - today I don't deal with clients um I
38:36 - guess you could call my coaching clients
38:37 - clients uh but that's entirely different
38:40 - um so you know after just to back up I
38:43 - won't spend much time on this yet but to
38:45 - back up after right right when my
38:47 - business was failing another opportunity
38:50 - presented itself and somebody emailed me
38:52 - asking if I would create a course for
38:54 - them uh because they saw a couple of the
38:56 - YouTube videos I did and I was just
38:59 - doing Photoshop tutorials and um I had
39:02 - only up to like a couple of them and and
39:04 - so I took that offer up and they paid me
39:07 - like $2,500 to make a course on like
39:10 - Photoshop or something and so I started
39:13 - making my money that way and so I
39:14 - pivoted from client work to teaching now
39:19 - and that happened very quick fortunately
39:20 - and I'm glad it did because I was able
39:22 - to not have to get a regular job so to
39:24 - speak I and I was just basically
39:26 - contracted on a month basis to create a
39:28 - course so I was making one course every
39:30 - month typically about 120 you know 90 to
39:33 - it was typically about 90 minutes long
39:35 - that they wanted and this was in vad
39:37 - network which are the people behind
39:39 - theme forest uh which is I think still
39:42 - popular but it used to be really popular
39:44 - familiar with their work we've oh I get
39:46 - their emails occasionally because I
39:47 - think I bought something on one of their
39:49 - websites a long time and so they own tou
39:51 - plus.com yeah and that's what I was
39:53 - teaching on and so I did about two years
39:55 - worth of work with that so anyhow not to
39:58 - we can go back to that but just to
40:00 - answer your question so I haven't really
40:02 - I of course sparingly maybe one time a
40:05 - year I'll have a client that I do actual
40:07 - work with I but it's sometimes that
40:10 - client could be me it could be a
40:12 - personal project um but that's one of
40:15 - those things you know being a creator
40:16 - for so long now I've been in you know
40:19 - being a creator for about 10 years uh
40:22 - and being on the teaching side of things
40:24 - is yes you have to continually learn a
40:26 - lot of new things to be be able to
40:27 - create new content but I'm at a point
40:30 - now it's like I want to start getting
40:32 - back into client work so that I could
40:34 - start changing for for one I could start
40:37 - getting real world experience again back
40:39 - with working with clients which I'm not
40:41 - afraid of because I know how to do it
40:42 - yeah um and I know the current skills
40:44 - you know obviously my skills 10 years
40:46 - ago wouldn't translate today but so I'm
40:48 - I'm always very current because I have
40:49 - to be with my YouTube channel I but I I
40:52 - I do want to get back into um creating
40:55 - you know some type of a hybrid of a a
40:57 - design subscription agency maybe where I
40:59 - only take on one client a month or so
41:02 - until I'm done with them and then as a
41:04 - part of their package they'll get
41:05 - featured their if they want it to be
41:07 - their project will get featured on my
41:08 - YouTube channel so it's kind of like a
41:10 - win-win if they want that marketing and
41:12 - publicity along with having me design
41:14 - their site and so I'm going to get if
41:16 - that's my plan is to get back into that
41:18 - sort of thing as a way to a get into
41:20 - client workk but also be I have new
41:23 - content and interesting content on the
41:25 - YouTube channel yeah so let's say I have
41:27 - like a barbecue sauce company and uh I'm
41:30 - like oh I can not only get my barbecue
41:33 - sauce website designed implemented uh
41:37 - potentially set up to be relatively
41:38 - maintainable but also I'm going to get
41:41 - free not free publ based in like people
41:45 - are going to be looking at my barbecue
41:46 - website as Gary explains how we built it
41:49 - right it's just like additional
41:50 - incidental publicity right right yeah
41:53 - yeah and I would think you know maybe it
41:55 - wouldn't be a barbecue uh sauce company
41:57 - maybe it would be you know somebody who
41:59 - has a business that could benefit from
42:02 - that type of audience that I have so
42:03 - something like devel design or
42:06 - development related perhaps because they
42:08 - would get their biggest bang for the
42:09 - buck in that that context so so like
42:11 - let's say some loow code tool for
42:14 - example or would be potentially like uh
42:17 - you know an AI API or something like
42:20 - that right right yeah so I'm excited to
42:23 - to start working on that sometime this
42:24 - year so very cool well anyway body who
42:27 - wants to potentially be a c of G's shoot
42:30 - him a message uh I'll I'll put his
42:32 - contact below uh but um I want to talk
42:35 - about freelance because freelance is how
42:39 - most people start their developer
42:40 - careers unless they just happen to go to
42:43 - a career affir after graduating from
42:44 - Stanford computer science degree like
42:47 - had this like nice carpet rolled out for
42:49 - them by like right a Fang company or
42:51 - something like that most
42:53 - people uh that are learning the code are
42:55 - going to get a friend or family member a
42:57 - local business somebody to give them
43:00 - money uh to develop something for them
43:03 - develop like some internal tool develop
43:05 - some sort of um you know website uh
43:08 - maybe even just build like uh you know a
43:10 - custom Shopify page or something like
43:12 - that right like
43:14 - so maybe you can talk a little bit about
43:17 - the skills that are important to a
43:19 - freelancer and I've got a bunch of
43:20 - questions I'm going to fire off at you
43:22 - first maybe you can talk about the
43:23 - importance of like sales and marketing
43:26 - skills okay as a freelancer yeah so I'm
43:30 - going to say um not a lot of people want
43:32 - to hear this probably but in my opinion
43:34 - at the very least understanding
43:37 - marketing um is just as important if not
43:40 - more important than understanding you
43:43 - know the actual skills that you need to
43:45 - deliver the product or the service in
43:46 - this case if it's it could be uiux
43:48 - design skills or front-end development
43:50 - or backend um or even internet marketing
43:52 - if you're doing that route but I knowing
43:55 - how to do internet marketing itself is
43:57 - just as important uh than those things
44:00 - as well in my opinion uh because I even
44:03 - even though I I satisfied like 97 98% of
44:08 - my clients I with the logo design
44:10 - business and stuff once Google stopped
44:12 - sending me all those you know all that
44:15 - traffic I I didn't know what to do
44:17 - really from there and and so I didn't
44:19 - really have good marketing skills even
44:22 - though I that's because I had I got
44:23 - lucky you know that that web page ranked
44:26 - very well and I got lucky with it uh so
44:29 - when that happened I was like oh my how
44:31 - do I get how do I get traffic you know
44:33 - and like I could design really well and
44:34 - you know I can do all these things but
44:36 - they're worth nothing if you don't have
44:39 - the traffic and you don't have you know
44:41 - the ability to sell your your services
44:44 - and so my my practical advice in today's
44:48 - you know current environment is there's
44:50 - many different ways to get clients um
44:52 - there's there's search engine
44:54 - optimization which is still around I
44:56 - don't think that's going anywhere of
44:57 - course you know the AI stuff has kind of
44:59 - thrown a wrench into that a little bit
45:01 - but I search engine optimization if you
45:03 - want to choose that and you want to
45:05 - stick with that um as being your go-to
45:08 - source of like how I'm going to get
45:09 - clients you can completely do that and
45:11 - go down that rabbit hole and start
45:13 - learning SEO um or you can go the social
45:17 - media route and that's that's a route
45:20 - that I took for my business my education
45:22 - business of course I focused hardcore on
45:25 - YouTube um and so so you have to pick an
45:28 - Avenue and you have to stick with it if
45:31 - you try to spread yourself too thin by
45:33 - trying to do you know SEO on top of
45:36 - Instagram and Tik Tok and YouTube and x
45:39 - and all that stuff it's going to be
45:41 - probably a little bit more difficult um
45:43 - at the same time there's a middle ground
45:45 - because you don't want to just choose
45:46 - one like I did with Google I but the the
45:51 - the the the good part of the story is
45:53 - that it's just it's just a matter of
45:55 - okay you took the time to start learning
45:58 - your craft and your skills like if
46:00 - you're a UI designer that might be being
46:02 - really good at UI design and and you
46:03 - have a great eye for UI design
46:05 - Aesthetics well you need to take that
46:07 - same that same type of motivation apply
46:10 - it equally to okay I have to get clients
46:13 - now I and how am I going to do that
46:15 - that's through internet marketing
46:17 - through one of those channels yeah
46:18 - interesting so just to recap what you're
46:20 - saying take that same passion that you
46:22 - feel for the technology that you're
46:24 - using and channel it into getting
46:26 - clients and learning how to use
46:28 - marketing channels to your advantage
46:30 - right I can talk a little bit more
46:33 - specifically about how one can do that
46:35 - but yes yeah I mean a lot of people out
46:37 - there consider themselves like
46:38 - introverts and uh as a result they may
46:43 - feel very out of place going to like a
46:47 - you know a Toast Masters or like like a
46:50 - rot club or uh or going to like a just
46:53 - like a local American Chamber of
46:55 - Commerce type event or something that
46:57 - and trying to make friends and
46:58 - potentially get clients um right what
47:02 - would your advice be to those you have
47:04 - to yeah and so that that's like the same
47:06 - thing with my wife she's huge in
47:08 - introvert um and I want her to start
47:12 - creating an internet presence for her
47:14 - she's a lactation consultant now so she
47:16 - she helps moms breastfeed basically um
47:19 - and she's the only one in the tricon
47:20 - area and and I I told her I was like you
47:23 - can make a lot of money like if you were
47:24 - to sell like a book or something and
47:26 - become the influencer route and but
47:28 - she's like I hate being in front of the
47:29 - camera and I was like okay well I didn't
47:32 - like the idea either if you go back on
47:33 - my channel and you click on the videos
47:35 - Tab and you you sort it by the oldest
47:38 - first you'll see one of my first videos
47:41 - um where I actually presented myself on
47:43 - screen that was in 2014 and it's
47:46 - terrible you know you don't you don't
47:49 - feel right I about it you you feel out
47:52 - of place but that's an expected part of
47:54 - the process because it's something new
47:56 - that you've never done before so you
47:58 - look at yourself you might look at
47:59 - yourself and say this is so cringey but
48:02 - as long as you're delivering the the
48:03 - content and people will like it and
48:05 - you'll see that based on how the content
48:07 - you know uh how it's performing in terms
48:10 - of views likes comments dislikes and you
48:13 - know whatever platform has for for
48:15 - engagement factors um but the the the
48:18 - the short the the idea here is though is
48:21 - that you have to do it if you want to be
48:23 - successful now I'm not saying you have
48:25 - to get behind video camera but I'm
48:26 - saying whatever it is that you want to
48:28 - do if it requires you to do something
48:30 - that's out of your comfort zone you have
48:32 - to you have to just ignore that you have
48:34 - to ignore it because otherwise what's
48:36 - the what's the alternative the
48:37 - alternative is not doing it and you're
48:38 - going to fail no matter what um so you
48:40 - don't have to have the best equipment um
48:42 - I certainly didn't you know you slowly
48:44 - start to amass and increase your
48:46 - production value and and all that stuff
48:48 - if we're talking about video and uh
48:50 - content and St and stuff like
48:52 - that yeah that makes a lot of sense so
48:55 - just to again recap you're saying like
48:58 - at the end of the day you could be an
48:59 - amazing developer you could be amazing
49:01 - at understanding client requirements and
49:03 - everything but if any one of those
49:05 - different like legs of your stool is
49:08 - weak the stool's going to fall over
49:10 - right it's going to collapse over you
49:11 - and it sounds like being extroverted or
49:15 - putting yourself out there doing the
49:16 - uncomfortable thing is one of those
49:18 - things that you just have to you know
49:20 - right and some people will find that
49:21 - more natural than others CU we're all
49:23 - different and we're all you know you
49:25 - could be a type a person ity versus you
49:27 - know somebody who's a complete introvert
49:29 - you know and those people will have an
49:31 - easier time but you can still do it you
49:34 - can still get behind that camera and
49:35 - click record and start recording
49:37 - yourself uh there's nothing stopping you
49:39 - unless you don't have a camera of course
49:41 - so I and even if it's not even video
49:44 - related content it could be for instance
49:46 - if you're going to take the social media
49:47 - route well I say you know you need to
49:50 - amass a following essentially and how do
49:51 - you do that it's by typing out good
49:54 - content or if it's going to be you it
49:56 - could be written content it could be
49:57 - just pictures or infographics that are
49:59 - interesting maybe based on what you're
50:01 - learning as a uiux designer you're
50:03 - sharing your work grow your audience as
50:05 - much as possible and you do that by
50:07 - producing content um if you want to take
50:09 - that route there's a lot of routes to
50:11 - getting clients I and we can delve into
50:13 - that a little bit more but well let's
50:15 - talk about the clients themselves that
50:17 - you typically work with or that you work
50:19 - with when you're doing a lot more
50:20 - freelance work uh are are what kind of
50:23 - Institutions are your main clients are
50:25 - are they like small businesses generally
50:28 - or so yeah so back then when I was
50:30 - dealing with um those type of clients
50:32 - they were typically you know somebody
50:34 - who's just going to Google literally and
50:36 - typing how to design a logo or website
50:38 - and a lot of these are small business
50:39 - owners or people who are just launching
50:41 - a business I never got to the point
50:44 - where I was working with like really
50:47 - large businesses or or institutions
50:50 - because I was content with you know the
50:53 - amount of money I was making you know
50:55 - you back in like 2010 10,000 a month is
50:57 - still a lot of money um not so much now
51:01 - but I it and I and I was just content
51:04 - with it you know and I I did work a lot
51:08 - of my own like side projects I had
51:11 - several different Ventures and and I
51:13 - applied my you know my learnings that
51:15 - way but but in terms of the clients
51:17 - themselves minimal communication um
51:20 - mainly you know there's probably a good
51:22 - mix of like uh local brick and mortar
51:25 - businesses but also internet businesses
51:28 - as well because I was known pretty well
51:29 - in forums and stuff and um and that that
51:32 - was my a clientele and when you're
51:34 - charging less you know such a cheap
51:36 - amount you know you didn't I didn't
51:38 - really I wasn't really on the radar of
51:40 - like really large businesses um that's
51:43 - one of the reasons I want to kind of get
51:44 - back into it as well um I know that
51:48 - having the information that I know now
51:49 - and also my network and my audience that
51:52 - I could I could definitely you know
51:54 - charge a lot more um I and work on a
51:58 - little bit like a longer time frame per
52:00 - client uh compared to what I was doing
52:03 - before so uh one thing that jumped out
52:06 - of me that you've said in the past is
52:08 - that you don't like to charge an hourly
52:10 - rate but instead charge by the
52:12 - deliverable itself right how did you
52:14 - come on like like how did you come to
52:16 - this conclusion and has there ever been
52:19 - any push back from clients that are
52:21 - thinking in terms of like oh I just want
52:22 - you to work for n hours or something
52:24 - like that right right and I've always
52:26 - told them I was like you know it it
52:29 - really depends and I always felt not
52:31 - comfortable with take taking on a
52:34 - project they gave me all the information
52:35 - that I want and because if you're going
52:37 - to charge like a per project base and
52:39 - not hour hourly then you your intake
52:41 - form has to be very comprehensive it has
52:44 - to be it has to cover all the bases
52:46 - because you don't want to be a situation
52:47 - where they're like oh okay you you told
52:50 - me it would be $2,000 to make this site
52:53 - I and then they're they're like but
52:57 - I want this now and I'm like well you
52:59 - didn't include that so like if it's a
53:01 - very open like Whimsical thing where I
53:04 - the client may not know what needs to be
53:06 - done or whatever hourly would make sense
53:09 - but most of the time I when I dealt with
53:11 - clients they were able to provide me
53:13 - with all the information I need so that
53:15 - I would be comfortable enough with
53:17 - giving them a solid concrete
53:19 - price yeah and are there any red flags
53:22 - that you see when you're looking for a
53:24 - freelance client like is there like some
53:26 - pattern or some Persona that you're like
53:28 - oh no it's one of these kinds of
53:29 - potential clients yeah so like don't
53:32 - undervalue your services um don't sell
53:34 - yourself for too cheap uh because those
53:37 - type of clients typically end up being
53:39 - the most picky um so red flags in that
53:44 - context so so for me with being that
53:47 - most of my clients I never talked to
53:49 - them before they became my client I
53:52 - could tell you I could see red flags in
53:54 - their intake form in that that they
53:56 - hardly fill anything out and so I would
53:59 - sometimes respond to them like listen I
54:01 - need more information if I'm going to be
54:03 - able to accurately design an identity
54:05 - for you um so for everybody else though
54:09 - who might not take that R in in the
54:11 - traditional approach where clients will
54:12 - first contact them well it's very
54:14 - important to be able to read into um
54:17 - what they're saying and how they're
54:19 - saying things uh because you would see
54:21 - red flags potentially based on just
54:24 - their the words they choose the use and
54:27 - and the ideas that they're trying to to
54:29 - get across you could there there's red
54:31 - flags that would say I I'm not going to
54:34 - take on this project there's definitely
54:35 - those scenarios um and it it might be a
54:38 - situation where they seem too iffy and
54:40 - not certain on Project requirements uh
54:43 - as long as there are certain and they
54:45 - answer everything that you need then I
54:47 - think the red flags could be avoided um
54:51 - but if they're not able to provide you
54:52 - with all the necessary information you
54:54 - need and they seem wishy-washy those
54:56 - might be the ones that you might want to
54:57 - avoid yeah and and that's just because
54:59 - they may not know what they want and if
55:00 - they don't know what they want they're
55:02 - you're not going to know what they want
55:03 - yeah it could be a situation like that
55:05 - as well and and it's really hard like
55:07 - sometimes like my mom like if she sends
55:09 - texts and we we text each other back and
55:11 - forth like she does she's just not
55:13 - familiar with internet vernacular and
55:15 - how you say things or whatever and like
55:17 - I for me I feel like I can read anything
55:19 - anybody types and get a really good
55:21 - sense of what they're thinking you know
55:22 - and what they're inferring all so having
55:25 - that skill is important I would say um
55:28 - to be able to determine like if they're
55:29 - going to be a good client it's the same
55:31 - thing with relationships some people are
55:32 - just terrible at picking a partner they
55:36 - there just like it they just lack this
55:38 - innate sense to really read a person
55:40 - well which is unfortunate I but I've
55:43 - always thought that I could read people
55:44 - well um and so I was always able to
55:47 - avoid the bad horrible client situation
55:49 - for the most part they existed and
55:51 - you're never going to be able to avoid
55:53 - them 100% I because yeah people will
55:56 - charge back on you um like they pay you
55:59 - through and that happens I mean
56:01 - especially after 2,000 clients people
56:03 - will charge back uh when you're dealing
56:05 - with a like a service-based industry
56:07 - where you know it's a very aesthetic and
56:09 - a subjective idea like like what
56:11 - constitutes a good logo they might think
56:13 - it's one with like a lens flare and I'm
56:15 - saying that's terrible idea you know so
56:17 - you're going to have that um but you
56:19 - know as long as your skills are good and
56:21 - your communication skills are good and
56:22 - you can read people you shouldn't have
56:23 - much of a problem with that sort of
56:25 - thing and it's certainly not reason not
56:26 - to get into it to service based industry
56:30 - yeah well let's talk about pricing
56:34 - because I imagine you have like allart
56:36 - services like if you want this then it's
56:38 - this much this much but sometimes when
56:40 - you work with a client maybe you're
56:41 - doing something more bespoke and how do
56:45 - you know how much to ask for for a given
56:50 - project thought process yeah for me it's
56:52 - like that's a it's a difficult question
56:54 - because there's not an objectively
56:55 - correct answer for every business um I I
56:59 - suppose through testing you could find
57:01 - what that might be and when I say
57:03 - testing we're talking like AB split
57:05 - testing with with pricing and stuff like
57:07 - that to find like okay if I raise the
57:10 - price am I going to lose clients I is is
57:13 - my conversion ratio going to drop you
57:15 - know and that's that makes sense of
57:17 - course if you're doing the the type of
57:19 - pricing that I was doing where it's just
57:20 - it's upfront you know like when somebody
57:22 - visited that page they didn't have to
57:24 - contact me first to realize what the
57:25 - price
57:26 - and that's because I was doing kind of
57:28 - like real quick work in a way I was kind
57:30 - of like a McDonald's of loc Lo design
57:32 - because it was cheap it was really cheap
57:34 - and so I could get away with just you
57:36 - know but then again bread of design Joy
57:38 - I mean if he's charging four thou $5,000
57:41 - per client you know it's not not
57:43 - necessarily that clients won't do it
57:45 - because it's more expensive but you have
57:46 - to have a really good onboarding process
57:49 - uh to to get people to to want to hand
57:51 - you the money first without talking to
57:53 - you first yeah um so for me like if I'm
57:57 - talking you your average you know like
57:58 - your listen anybody watching this right
58:00 - now you may not approach it that way
58:02 - because that's not your typical way to
58:04 - take on design clients usually they'll
58:07 - there'll be a contact form on your site
58:08 - and they'll give you'll get a little bit
58:10 - of details about the project but then
58:11 - it'll send you that email or
58:13 - notification of some sort and then
58:15 - you're going to contact them get more
58:17 - information and then you come to a price
58:19 - that's the typical way which I rarely
58:21 - ever did myself because I just didn't
58:23 - want to do a clients and client
58:25 - communication I wanted to to minimize
58:26 - that as much as possible and not to say
58:28 - that that's what you should do that's
58:30 - just how I personally wanted to handle
58:32 - things hands off as much as possible um
58:35 - and so but if you were if I were to do
58:37 - to take that route I the price that I
58:40 - chose is going to be based on my
58:42 - research of what other um Freelancers
58:46 - you know in my specific Niche are
58:48 - charging you know and you can really
58:50 - Niche down as a designer developer like
58:52 - if you're a uiux designer maybe maybe
58:55 - you may maybe you don't even have
58:56 - clients maybe you'll you'll sell framer
58:58 - templates or web flow templates or you
59:00 - use that to you know as a side hustle or
59:03 - something um but in terms of knowing
59:06 - what to charge I would I would get out
59:08 - there personally I would see okay
59:09 - anybody with a design subscription
59:11 - agency if I'm going to do something like
59:12 - that I'm going to I'm going to take
59:14 - notes of what they're charging based on
59:15 - the quality of the work based on what
59:18 - they're delivering you might even sign
59:21 - up uh or you might hit up another
59:23 - designer asking them like for you
59:26 - pretend just to be a client I've never
59:27 - done this but I think it's a good idea
59:29 - because you could kind of then you be
59:30 - able to see not to un to intentionally
59:33 - mislead somebody but what would their
59:35 - what's their first response look like
59:37 - after you contact them you know for you
59:39 - know maybe they'll give you pricing
59:40 - ideas but for me I would see what the
59:42 - market is dictating yeah and I would
59:45 - instead of selling myself short which is
59:47 - what I did initially with the logo
59:49 - design I would I would start higher than
59:51 - what I think I'm worth and more often
59:53 - times than not you you are worth what
59:56 - you think you're not worth if that makes
59:58 - sense are you ever afraid to like throw
60:00 - out a price that people are going to B
60:02 - at it and it's going to end the
60:03 - conversation well in a Moder in a
60:06 - context that fits my business currently
60:08 - um when I used to take on sponsorships
60:10 - on my YouTube channel that was one of
60:12 - those things where you have to throw out
60:14 - a price to these companies like
60:16 - indeed.com like they were one of my
60:18 - biggest I'm clients I and I worked with
60:20 - so many others like skillshare and and
60:23 - all them and they they hit you up in
60:25 - sort of the same way way like it's it's
60:27 - all economics you know supply and demand
60:30 - the their demand was they wanted um they
60:32 - wanted traffic targeted traffic to their
60:35 - their business or product um and in that
60:38 - that case I was just looking what other
60:40 - creators were doing we have a Discord
60:42 - server all all of us YouTube programmers
60:44 - and stuff we have a Discord server uh
60:47 - and it's private and we talk about what
60:49 - we charge and it's based on your views
60:51 - and all that stuff so the same thing can
60:53 - be said about um your web design
60:55 - business as well you have to be honest
60:57 - with your skills uh because obviously
61:00 - not all uiux designers and frontend
61:02 - developers are of the same caliber so
61:05 - you have to be honest with yourself um
61:08 - and and and take into consideration what
61:10 - others are charging and then also
61:12 - Implement that and experiment with split
61:15 - testing uh if you're you're getting
61:17 - traffic to your website you're trying to
61:19 - generate leads split test everything as
61:21 - much as possible um to to to find out
61:23 - what it is you need to do to you know
61:25 - know get more leads get more conversions
61:28 - um and then experiment with pricing that
61:30 - you tell people as well yeah so the
61:32 - website the actual stuff you can control
61:35 - uh by pe by the time people go to you
61:37 - know Gary Simon uh.com or or some
61:41 - comparable like uh portfolio site uh or
61:44 - some sort of uh I guess squeeze page is
61:47 - what we used to call them back in the
61:48 - day where your goal is to get people
61:50 - like down the funnel and clicking
61:52 - through to contacting or entering their
61:54 - credit card or something like correct uh
61:57 - before you can even get people there of
61:59 - course you need to get out there and the
62:02 - way that most people get out there these
62:04 - days is through like SEO or through um
62:09 - Google ad which is pretty expensive
62:11 - Facebook ads I mean that is a way you
62:13 - can do that if you have enough
62:15 - money they they used to say it takes
62:18 - money to make money but to some extent
62:20 - if you create content or if you if
62:21 - you're on social media or if you're good
62:23 - with SEO you can kind of like get free
62:26 - traffic yes uh but if you were starting
62:29 - over or maybe how would you advise
62:31 - somebody who's starting today and
62:32 - they've already got great skills let's
62:34 - take for granted that these people
62:35 - already have great skills we'll talk a
62:36 - little bit about how to get great skills
62:38 - later but let's assume that people do
62:40 - have great skills and it's just a
62:41 - question of getting clients what kind of
62:45 - projects or what kind of things do you
62:48 - think would attract clients to actually
62:50 - come to your website right right so um
62:54 - like I said earlier there's a lot of
62:56 - different ways to find clients and I
62:58 - think it's important for that individual
63:01 - to understand first all their options
63:04 - like what are the ways that you can get
63:05 - a client as a uiux designer and what are
63:08 - the ways you can get a client as a
63:09 - frontend developer you because there's
63:11 - are slightly different things there's a
63:13 - lot of overlap of course and once you
63:15 - understand the various methods um of
63:17 - which you could potentially gain clients
63:20 - and maybe even not even gain clients
63:22 - like if you're not even going to work
63:23 - with a client like I said you could sell
63:25 - templates for templates and web flow
63:27 - templates they make really good money
63:28 - doing that if you focused on it so once
63:31 - you understand what the options are then
63:34 - you can pair that with what you're
63:35 - comfortable with focusing on in terms of
63:38 - I like how I'm going to choose to to to
63:40 - build clients so when I have my coaching
63:42 - calls um with with people that are in
63:45 - that this exact scenario I've had
63:47 - several of them um I I have this little
63:50 - document and I and I tell them okay well
63:53 - I the modern way I would say for most
63:57 - like uiux designers front of developers
64:00 - I would focus on social media personally
64:02 - uh and building an audience that way I
64:05 - would share my work as much as possible
64:07 - I would follow a lot of the people who
64:09 - are already established and in the
64:11 - position that I want to be in and one
64:13 - little hack I have for that um you know
64:15 - if you go to awards.com awww ars.com
64:19 - there's a jury section and they have
64:21 - jurors there that kind of rate the best
64:23 - websites um and it links it list their
64:26 - their their their X profile and their
64:28 - LinkedIn profile if they have one and
64:30 - there are like hundreds of these people
64:32 - and I tell them just follow them develop
64:34 - a network see how these people carry
64:37 - themselves on social media see what it
64:38 - is that they're doing because these
64:40 - people they're they're working either
64:42 - with large companies uh or or design
64:45 - agencies or they're solo uh and they're
64:47 - charging like 20 $30,000 for projects or
64:50 - more and so they're they're they're at
64:52 - the Pinnacle some of these a lot of
64:53 - these people are and so you want to
64:55 - follow them and see how they they carry
64:57 - themselves um and then you can interact
64:59 - with them you can start to that's
65:01 - networking that's part of what it is
65:03 - another thing you can do like I said
65:04 - sharing your work is the obvious thing
65:06 - uh but also sharing if you're a beginner
65:08 - sharing tips that you learned as you go
65:11 - because suddenly you become the best
65:13 - person to teach that thing uh because
65:16 - being that that the Newbie problem you
65:18 - know was fresh in your mind um and
65:19 - you'll find that people will start to
65:21 - follow you naturally and and having a
65:23 - following um is a benefit icial Factor
65:26 - if you're trying to either get employed
65:29 - like in a traditional employer employee
65:31 - relationship but also freelance as well
65:34 - um I'm not saying you just want to have
65:36 - a ton of other designers following you
65:39 - uh but you'll find that if you start
65:41 - putting out your work consistently and
65:43 - you're engaged and you're you know the I
65:45 - am a UI designer this is what I put out
65:46 - today you know and mention your
65:48 - portfolio and
65:50 - stuff by by nature of having followers
65:53 - of perhaps other people who are in your
65:54 - shoes it starts to I it becomes a real
65:58 - really good factor in um you know other
66:02 - designers reaching out and collabing
66:04 - with you and perhaps they have another
66:06 - uh maybe they have a client that's not a
66:08 - good frit for them or you know there's
66:10 - so many different ways if you're able to
66:12 - build up your a following on social
66:14 - media so I think social media is like in
66:17 - my opinion one of the best ways to get
66:19 - started uh because it's something you
66:20 - can do while learning um and and and so
66:24 - I think that's a a great aspect or or a
66:26 - great method for yeah I trying to trying
66:29 - to just establish a presence online and
66:32 - and from that um you can you can
66:35 - definitely get to a point where you're
66:38 - you're getting a lot of client requests
66:40 - yeah I mean social media you hit it kind
66:43 - of on the head in my humble opinion uh
66:45 - social media is something you can do
66:46 - along the way it's right almost kind of
66:49 - free it doesn't take that much time to
66:51 - tweet about this project you just spent
66:53 - like 10 hours building it takes like two
66:54 - seconds to twe
66:56 - right um and it's you just kind of do it
66:59 - along the way and it's like it's almost
67:02 - like a a limb is kind of how I think of
67:05 - social media it's like a way of me
67:08 - expressing myself and sharing
67:10 - information it's like you an organ yeah
67:13 - and and then if you want to take it a
67:14 - step further and this is something I did
67:16 - for a while as well is you know I would
67:19 - you know every time I learn something
67:20 - you could write an article about it um
67:22 - so I had another site called cet.com and
67:25 - and I got that up to 10,000 visors a day
67:28 - and I was teaching angular back then I
67:31 - and so like I ranked very high for
67:33 - angular and well all I did was you know
67:35 - I kind of followed the Gary vanard Check
67:38 - route um and and and that's what got me
67:41 - started on YouTube actually um he's like
67:43 - make a piece of content every day it
67:45 - doesn't matter what it is and so he did
67:47 - that with his Wine Library TV he did
67:49 - like 3 years of every day doing a wine
67:51 - review and just went nuts on it and it
67:54 - was very successful because no matter
67:55 - what he made a video so I did that as
67:58 - well uh my first 100 videos were 100
68:00 - videos in 100 days and I got burned out
68:02 - but that was huge um so if if somebody
68:05 - wanted to take that mentality you need
68:07 - to apply that mentality like if you're
68:09 - serious you need to apply that if it's
68:11 - going to be social media focusing on you
68:12 - need to do something it doesn't have to
68:14 - be every day but if you're going to
68:16 - determine it's two to three times a week
68:17 - I'm putting out content then you have to
68:19 - stick with that no matter what um you
68:22 - you have to be like for scump and that's
68:24 - the mindset that you have to get into
68:25 - whether you're trying to learn a new
68:27 - skill and that means learning something
68:29 - every day or promoting something every
68:30 - day uh that's where the consistency the
68:34 - consistency will pay off regardless of
68:36 - what Avenue you're choosing so for me I
68:38 - would write an article I every time I
68:40 - uploaded a video for a while and so
68:42 - there therefore that took care of the
68:44 - SEO um I started getting like longtail
68:47 - traffic keywords and and all that stuff
68:49 - and you don't have to be an SEO God to
68:51 - understand how to rank you just have to
68:53 - be absolute consistent um and pumping
68:56 - out content a lot um and and that's
68:59 - that's that's what you can do if you
69:01 - don't have like a big marketing budget
69:03 - like through paid
69:04 - ads all the paid ads can be very
69:07 - profitable but you typically have to
69:08 - lose a lot of money because it it
69:11 - requires optimization um if we're
69:13 - talking about paid ads like through like
69:15 - Facebook or Google there's like a
69:16 - discovery process like you have to
69:17 - iterate on your ads and Facebook go and
69:21 - you're paying money the whole way yeah
69:23 - and I don't that's why I personally
69:24 - don't advocate for for it um I'm not I
69:27 - mean I've done P paid ads for a while um
69:30 - like a long time ago so I don't know
69:31 - what the current I'm sure it's more
69:33 - competitive um so it's going to be more
69:36 - difficult and it requires it requires
69:38 - money up front and you may not you may
69:40 - lose to it's it's common for marketers
69:43 - to lose thousands of dollars early on in
69:45 - a campaign uh because you have to you
69:48 - have to really mod I make sure your ad
69:51 - copy is very good the the initial Banner
69:53 - that they click on like whether that's
69:54 - on Google or Facebook um and then you
69:57 - have to make sure your landing page is
69:59 - like on point uh and and so for me if
70:03 - you're starting out you don't have much
70:04 - money uh SEO organic SEO is a a really
70:09 - great way along with um social media
70:13 - awesome uh and I just want to Echo some
70:15 - of the sentiments uh you know free C
70:17 - Camp as a charity we we've never had the
70:21 - budget for like advertising and because
70:23 - free cocain is free there's not any Roi
70:25 - advertising so we've always kind of
70:28 - been uh you know limited to social media
70:32 - limited to uh Google SEO which for every
70:36 - video for every podcast I write like a
70:38 - short article summarizing that podcast
70:40 - publish that on our own website having
70:42 - your own website having that be
70:44 - optimized having that be accessible
70:45 - having that be fast uh you know but
70:49 - basically what you just said you already
70:51 - spent the time to create the video
70:53 - tutorial or the you know why not also
70:55 - share it on social media why not also
70:57 - have an article that kind of serves as a
71:00 - vehicle an SEO vehicle for that piece of
71:03 - content so yeah I just that come down to
71:05 - delegating too I mean it is it takes
71:07 - time to to write stuff um and I've
71:09 - always been bad at delegating it's the
71:11 - one thing like I have to improve is
71:14 - being willing to allow other people to
71:16 - take over parts that are kind of mundane
71:19 - you know uh and so I've been a bad
71:21 - business person in in that regard
71:24 - because you can only grow so much you
71:26 - know until you hit a ceiling which I
71:28 - have hit a couple years ago so I'm
71:31 - making changes you know in that regard
71:33 - but um being willing to have other
71:35 - people do it but yeah I mean if you're
71:37 - willing to hustle I mean and and you
71:39 - have to sometimes you you have to hustle
71:41 - at different times in your life you're
71:42 - never going to be a hustler 24/7 I don't
71:44 - care what anybody says it's not
71:45 - sustainable for me it's it's I I go
71:48 - through periods you know where I'm a
71:50 - little bit more relaxed you know I spent
71:52 - six months building this studio um and
71:55 - then my business like I wouldn't say I I
71:57 - neglected it but I wasn't on top you
71:59 - know and I so those are things that you
72:02 - have to to to look out for yeah and just
72:05 - to add to that uh I genuinely believe
72:10 - that just doing fewer things but doing
72:13 - them well is totally fine and there's
72:15 - there's this old saying I always heard
72:17 - as a kid if you want something done
72:19 - right do it yourself and like to some
72:21 - extent like I don't have any assistants
72:23 - or anybody that helps me with like Bo
72:26 - will help upload the uh the podcast to
72:29 - YouTube and he'll uh uh help you know
72:32 - add my base intro to it and make sure
72:34 - like do some very basic video production
72:36 - but Bo runs the entire you know pre
72:39 - YouTube channel but like like that is
72:41 - kind of delegated to him like some of
72:42 - that but uh in terms of things that I do
72:46 - every week my job is pretty simple in
72:49 - that like I've chosen to prioritize a
72:51 - few key things that I can do sustainably
72:53 - and definitely okay
72:56 - I think where a lot of people have
72:58 - problems and they burn out is they try
72:59 - to do too many things as opposed to
73:02 - doing a few things well yeah and that's
73:05 - one of the problems like you know they
73:07 - people might see me and like oh this
73:09 - guy's really good at UI ux design he can
73:11 - do front of development he can do
73:13 - Identity Design and all this stuff and I
73:14 - was like yeah well I've been doing this
73:16 - for like 25 years or like more you know
73:19 - and so of course I I I I can have these
73:23 - skills and be pretty good at all of them
73:27 - but if you're trying to start off trying
73:30 - to start off being like a full stack
73:31 - developer you're going to have a very
73:33 - hard time like you have to pick one
73:35 - thing and really focus on that um you
73:38 - know I have no problem if somebody wants
73:39 - to learn figma as a UI ux designer and
73:42 - then on the side they're trying to learn
73:44 - HTML and like a little bit of CSS so
73:46 - they can understand like that's okay in
73:48 - my opinion that's you know it's always
73:49 - Bor it could be really boring the
73:50 - opposite if you're only con you know if
73:54 - you're- requiring yourself only to work
73:56 - within like one typ one tiny thing so
73:59 - there's other skills that you can work
74:00 - in but I wouldn't start trying to learn
74:03 - like I laravel PHP along with figma and
74:07 - like try to do both at the same time and
74:09 - try to get both of those type of clients
74:10 - at the same time that's very difficult I
74:13 - stick to one thing and then once you get
74:15 - pretty good with it and comfortable you
74:16 - know you can start to add other skills
74:19 - eventually and and and and also it's
74:22 - also I I don't want to say you can't do
74:24 - those things like for instance if you're
74:26 - trying to if you have a side project and
74:27 - I really believe in side projects you do
74:29 - have to wear a lot of hats for it to be
74:31 - successful if you're doing it alone so
74:33 - that means you're going to be doing the
74:34 - uiux design the Identity Design the
74:36 - front end development any backend stuff
74:38 - and the marketing and I think just going
74:41 - through that process uh as somebody to
74:44 - understand what it takes because you'll
74:45 - probably fail the first few times you do
74:47 - it it's good to have that as well under
74:49 - your belt because it will teach you a
74:52 - lesson like it's this stuff is not easy
74:54 - you know I if you have a great uiux
74:57 - design but I you know maybe your codee's
75:00 - terrible or more typically it's the
75:02 - opposite maybe you're a great coder but
75:03 - your UI this looks horrible well those
75:06 - are one of those things that you have to
75:08 - delegate out if your skills aren't up to
75:10 - par and to be able to design really good
75:12 - it takes years you know it's just like
75:14 - anything be able to play guitar it takes
75:16 - really well it takes years sometimes
75:18 - it's it's just one of those things you
75:20 - have to be consistent about and patient
75:21 - and as long as you understand those
75:23 - things up front you you can be
75:25 - successful yeah a lot of people burn out
75:28 - because they're like why am I not
75:29 - getting the results I've been lifting
75:31 - weights for six weeks why am
75:33 - I exactly yeah and it's the same like
75:37 - like like my course like I have a uiux
75:39 - design course is 16 hours and it's
75:40 - interactive it's all this stuff and and
75:43 - I you know it might take the average
75:45 - person a month or two but you're not
75:46 - going to be a great uiux designer after
75:48 - you take the chorus and that sounds like
75:50 - a bad thing for me to say as somebody
75:52 - who wants to promote my course and I
75:53 - want people to buy it but I'm being
75:55 - honest with you yeah you can you can
75:57 - have you can watch the course and follow
75:59 - along but then you have to start putting
76:01 - this stuff together in your own you know
76:03 - your own Rule and it's a lot different
76:05 - so it takes a lot of practice to build
76:07 - that muscle memory and what you said
76:09 - about what you said about projects like
76:11 - obviously if you're building a project
76:13 - and you're putting it out on like Reddit
76:14 - and like look at what I built and all
76:16 - that stuff you're going to have to have
76:17 - so many different disciplines you're
76:19 - going to have to get some degree of
76:20 - exposure to so many different aspects of
76:23 - building something publicizing something
76:26 - uh and and just coming up with something
76:30 - and designing it is a whole another
76:32 - series of skills but you you can have a
76:35 - little bit of exposure to a whole lot of
76:36 - Concepts it's just not that you're going
76:37 - to go out and build yourself as a full
76:40 - engineer just because you did like you
76:42 - put some of this stuff together for a
76:44 - single project like like you said it
76:46 - took you 20 plus years to build up the
76:49 - skills that you have to be able to
76:51 - actually like I mean logo design you
76:53 - were
76:55 - deep on logo design 2000 logo design
76:58 - clients right like spent a great deal of
77:00 - time learning the theory and the
77:02 - practice behind identity and probably
77:05 - all the color theory typography like all
77:08 - these different concepts that go into
77:10 - being a really strong logo designer and
77:12 - feeling confident in your work right
77:15 - right right yeah so like like I said
77:18 - earlier like I'm not always in this mode
77:21 - of where I have to continually get
77:23 - better um some times I'm more complacent
77:26 - than others sometimes I'm you know
77:28 - really trying to learn something new
77:30 - hardcore so I'm not saying it takes you
77:32 - 20 years to like be great at like uiux
77:35 - design and front end development um but
77:38 - it's not going to happen after watching
77:40 - a couple full stack development courses
77:42 - either I it's just like I said it's just
77:45 - one of those things and I think the best
77:46 - way to learn I'm going to go back to
77:47 - this a little bit is a side project idea
77:50 - if you have a side project um and you're
77:52 - excited about it like it's an it's an
77:54 - idea you think think can maybe work
77:56 - somehow I like I'll give you a quick
77:58 - example the guitar stuff like um if
78:01 - you've ever if anybody has ever looked
78:02 - at like try to learn music theory
78:04 - through I like learning scales and modes
78:08 - like you'll see on a like a Google
78:10 - Images you'll see um these notes mapped
78:13 - out on little fretboards right where it
78:15 - shows the six strings and stuff and they
78:17 - always look like pixelated and junky and
78:19 - so I made this IDE I was like What if I
78:21 - we made this app that has a an
78:23 - interactive guitar fretboard where it's
78:25 - interactive and they can quickly change
78:26 - so sorry I hit my microphone so I made
78:29 - we made fretastic decom fastic and yeah
78:33 - F re t
78:36 - s.com and it's just like an interactive
78:38 - guitar fretboard service oh so this is
78:40 - sweet and and so I was excited about it
78:43 - because I was like there's there's a
78:45 - couple other competitors but they're not
78:46 - doing it right and they're it looks ugly
78:48 - um and so once I decided that hey this
78:51 - idea can make money I got excited about
78:54 - it and so so I I even though I do have a
78:57 - partner who's a developer on it it it
78:59 - will help you learn all of these things
79:02 - a lot easier because then it's not a
79:04 - chore you're excited about the project
79:06 - that's the problem with a lot of like
79:07 - like most courses or almost all courses
79:10 - it's hard to get excited about something
79:12 - else that somebody put together like
79:14 - through these tutorial projects or
79:16 - something but if you have that
79:17 - excitement about some little idea some
79:20 - type of tiny little sass you know
79:22 - software as a service or something I
79:24 - that that's when a lot of the stuff will
79:26 - you you will by nature of being
79:28 - interested in it you will start to learn
79:30 - these things if you want to try to go
79:32 - this solopreneur route or try your hand
79:34 - at Indie hacking or something like that
79:36 - awesome yeah this is a really cool
79:37 - project by the way uh I'll link to it in
79:39 - the show notes again a quick reminder
79:42 - that we do have lots of links uh if you
79:45 - click in the YouTube if you're watching
79:46 - this on YouTube YouTube video
79:48 - description or if you're listening to
79:49 - the audio version in the uh like in
79:52 - Spotify or in apple podcast whereever
79:54 - listening to this so frit tastic very
79:57 - cool um one thing that I want to talk
80:00 - about before we get into building skills
80:02 - because I'm very excited to talk about
80:04 - that is just are are there any channels
80:07 - for publicizing your work as a designer
80:10 - as a developer that you think are
80:12 - underutilized or or like more people
80:14 - should know about these because
80:16 - obviously everybody knows about like
80:17 - Twitter and Facebook and uh LinkedIn and
80:21 - and they may have even heard of like
80:22 - design places like dribble
80:25 - for example but what are some channels
80:29 - if you will that you can get your work
80:31 - out there and potentially find an
80:32 - audience that people may not be thinking
80:34 - about right so I just recently had this
80:36 - one idea I haven't executed on it yet
80:39 - but I'm fairly certain it would work
80:41 - pretty well is I've had this idea it's
80:43 - like okay this would be great idea for
80:46 - somebody who wants to get into freelance
80:48 - like say let's just say it could be
80:50 - friend and development or uiux we'll
80:51 - just say like as a uiux designer or uh
80:55 - or something like that um or maybe
80:57 - somebody who is even like like an indie
81:00 - hacker almost I mean I I noticed my
81:03 - wife's lactation consultant business
81:04 - she's a part of a Facebook group of with
81:06 - other lactation consultants and um they
81:10 - they're always complaining about the
81:11 - software they have two software options
81:13 - that people have made um for tracking
81:16 - your clients and all that stuff and I I
81:20 - guarantee you if you go to any type of
81:22 - Facebook group on based on any type of
81:24 - Interest or you know career or whatever
81:27 - you're going to find I you you're going
81:30 - to see real user feedback on the
81:32 - existing software or solutions that
81:33 - exist in there um you could promote
81:35 - yourself as somebody like say for
81:37 - instance I maybe you're really into
81:39 - Fitness training and you go to the gym a
81:41 - lot and you're also a uiux designer you
81:44 - can completely craft a business that's
81:46 - geared just to that towards that
81:48 - industry uh and and you could promote
81:51 - yourself potentially you know on
81:53 - something like that um and get your name
81:55 - out there I think that would be a great
81:57 - way because you know what I think one
81:58 - thing that's over utilized is something
82:01 - like dribble probably and he's like I'm
82:03 - a designer you know I'm going to put my
82:05 - my project on dribble and you get two or
82:08 - three views out of it and you're just
82:10 - lost in a sea of other people uh so for
82:13 - me like if we're you're thinking if
82:15 - you're trying to think outside of the
82:16 - box um developing a niche is a great way
82:20 - U especially you know in this day and
82:22 - age you know it's it's it's comp
82:24 - competitive as it's ever going to be
82:25 - probably um and it's only going to
82:27 - continue that way as the internet is
82:29 - more you know popular and such so if you
82:32 - can Niche down a little bit in that
82:34 - regard I think that would be a great
82:35 - play um just to to find so something
82:38 - that you maybe you have expertise in
82:41 - like a secondary skill like Fitness or
82:44 - guitar uh you could you could you could
82:46 - make band Pages for perhaps you really
82:48 - good at designing band Pages uh and and
82:51 - promote yourself in in the necessary uh
82:53 - markets where those people are
82:55 - frequented or frequenting frequenting
82:57 - sorry and there are lots of lawyers
82:59 - doctors uh people who who run small
83:02 - businesses probably uh people that uh
83:05 - you know repair uh washing machines and
83:07 - things like that my brother took that on
83:09 - right right yeah that that also are
83:11 - interested in bands or are interested in
83:14 - video games or any of these other
83:15 - Hobbies so a lot of times you can
83:18 - incidentally find people that are uh
83:21 - potential clients uh just within those
83:24 - area so right like for example like when
83:27 - I was uh a developer i' i' I'd go
83:30 - running through like San Francisco a lot
83:33 - and uh so I would go to like running
83:35 - meetups and incidentally meet people who
83:37 - were interested in client work who were
83:38 - just going for run just some lawyer or
83:41 - something right so like don't don't uh I
83:44 - guess weed out those kinds of activities
83:47 - those even though those may be fun for
83:49 - you they may also be networking
83:51 - opportunities oh yeah exactly you're
83:54 - right you could to totally just pick one
83:56 - industry like I said and like just go
83:58 - hard on that like try to land some like
84:01 - influencer clients perhaps uh offered
84:03 - you to work for free yeah just if
84:06 - they'll use your design like that's
84:07 - something that you put on proof and like
84:09 - I that's something I could talk about as
84:10 - well as I this idea that you can't do
84:13 - work for free yeah let's talk about that
84:16 - obviously an open source Community like
84:18 - a lot of the work done within Freo
84:20 - Camp's Community is done by open source
84:22 - contributors without any expectation of
84:25 - compensation right right right and so
84:27 - yeah there's this idea that um
84:29 - especially like for uh UI designers and
84:32 - stuff like you can't don't ever work for
84:34 - free and I agree with that but what
84:37 - they're talking about is they're talking
84:39 - about monetarily speaking don't work for
84:41 - free because if you're not making actual
84:43 - cash then it's not worth it but I and
84:47 - and there's positives and negatives what
84:50 - I'm about to say but I for me like I did
84:53 - work for free for a while um and and and
84:56 - doing contests is kind of like working
84:58 - for free if you don't win because it's
85:00 - very unlikely but um I I would actively
85:04 - back when I was doing search engine
85:05 - optimization long time ago like 2006 or
85:08 - something I like I would literally do
85:12 - design work for other website owners if
85:13 - they would link back to me so like I
85:16 - would get back links I know it's it's a
85:18 - little like gry hat SEO but um what I'm
85:21 - talking about into context like if
85:22 - you're a brand new designer uh and you
85:24 - don't have client work well you don't
85:27 - have a portfolio then right that's why
85:29 - some designers they'll have a portfolio
85:30 - and they'll put their portfolio as as
85:32 - one of their projects like don't do that
85:35 - uh you need actual work and to be able
85:37 - to Showcase and have a portfolio so a
85:39 - lot of people are wondering how do I get
85:41 - client work if I I have no portfolio and
85:45 - so one of one of my like I tell my
85:48 - coaching clients is like there's there's
85:49 - a lot of ways to find clients you just
85:52 - have to you might have to work for
85:53 - really cheap
85:54 - or free and the value in working for
85:58 - free monetarily speaking because you
86:00 - still gained something otherwise you
86:02 - wouldn't do it is in having the ability
86:05 - to have a a project on your portfolio
86:08 - with a case study and that right there
86:10 - is the value that you'll gain by doing
86:12 - something for free um and that is
86:15 - tremendous because one of the main
86:17 - things that the first thing I think that
86:19 - most clients or and employers will look
86:22 - at when they hit your folio is not going
86:25 - to be your portfolio itself it's going
86:27 - to be looking at your client work so if
86:30 - you if you did something for somebody um
86:32 - or even a side hustle a side project
86:35 - that works as well um and you're you're
86:38 - not paying yourself obviously uh you're
86:40 - giving yourself the the ability to have
86:42 - client work you know making sure they
86:45 - used it you know you don't want to put
86:47 - something in there that they didn't end
86:48 - up using it needs to be on a live
86:50 - website uh so that you can have that
86:53 - trust Factor for you so working for free
86:55 - in that context I have zero problem with
86:58 - I and some people say you shouldn't do
87:00 - that it's like well how do you get a
87:01 - client you know you so for for me I have
87:04 - no problem with with people working for
87:06 - free in that context because they didn't
87:08 - work for free they G they gained
87:10 - something out of it and that's the
87:11 - opportunity to have a portfolio which
87:13 - then leads to money yeah and like a
87:15 - Counterpoint that like a lot of people
87:17 - might say well I'm like struggling to
87:19 - pay my rent like why should I pay you
87:21 - know work for free there is some degree
87:23 - of privilege or just having like laid a
87:26 - financial Foundation to where this is
87:28 - why I tell people don't quit your day
87:29 - job to learn to code or learn you know
87:32 - design or really learn anything always
87:34 - make sure you you have that taken care
87:36 - of even if it reduces the amount of time
87:38 - you have in your day that you can
87:39 - dedicate to Improvement uh it's much
87:42 - better to gradually learn to code over
87:44 - yes three years than it is to find
87:47 - yourself in Dire Straits because you you
87:49 - bid off more than you could chew and I
87:50 - forget you know a lot of times people
87:52 - have regular jobs cuz I never did and
87:54 - then when I when I was learning I was
87:56 - like in middle school and you know like
87:58 - I didn't have I had like 10 years where
88:00 - I didn't have to worry about money so
88:02 - it's easy for me to sit here and say
88:04 - work for free but like you said if
88:07 - you're in a situation where you have a
88:09 - mortgage and you have bills to worry
88:10 - about uh yeah don't quit your job find
88:14 - that one hour night maybe where you
88:15 - typically just sat and watch Netflix and
88:18 - just apply it slowly slowly but surely
88:21 - you're going to learn you're you'll
88:22 - start to develop your skills I so don't
88:25 - quit your day job only quit your day job
88:28 - after your side hustle now makes you
88:30 - enough money consistently you know yeah
88:33 - uh to to quit your actual day job yeah
88:36 - and it should go without saying but
88:37 - don't do the like screw you qu you know
88:40 - keep those res keep those uh because you
88:43 - never know you might need to go back and
88:44 - there's no harm in going back uh there's
88:47 - no harm in not making it as a freelance
88:50 - developer this time and having to get
88:53 - your old day job back and then keep keep
88:56 - getting more app backs and that's why
88:58 - like your service our free code Camp is
89:00 - just absolutely amazing it's it's
89:02 - probably the single Source on the
89:04 - internet that's hope that's helped that
89:07 - many amount of people who perhaps you
89:09 - know they they do have a job already
89:11 - already and F funds are tight like your
89:15 - your your courses are just insanely you
89:18 - know you have courses that are like
89:20 - hours upon hours long that are free so
89:22 - there's no excuse for anybody yeah to
89:24 - say that well I I don't have the money
89:26 - to learn this you know or I don't have
89:28 - the the time again I know some people
89:30 - are very busy uh and it could be very
89:33 - difficult just to get an hour of time
89:34 - but most people if they're honest with
89:36 - themselves they're not that busy so it's
89:39 - just a matter of wanting it bad enough
89:41 - and if you don't want it bad enough
89:42 - don't do it but uh don't make excuses
89:44 - though by you're sitting around watching
89:46 - Netflix all day playing
89:49 - games so I've always been a gamer as
89:52 - well up until like past like five six
89:54 - years like I I I worked in gaming as
89:56 - well so it's not like I'm one of those
89:58 - people you have to hustle 247 no way
90:00 - yeah yeah and same same here I I enjoy
90:03 - uh games and I enjoy relaxing with my
90:05 - kids and doing lots of stuff that's not
90:07 - work that is not productive it took me a
90:09 - while to get to a position where I had
90:12 - the time and bandwidth to be able to do
90:13 - that but I'm I'm proud to say that like
90:15 - I'm not on 247 cuz it's not sustain no
90:19 - it's not healthy either right I I want
90:21 - to thank you for your kind words about
90:22 - free C Camp we're very proud to have
90:24 - created these free learning resources
90:25 - for everyone regardless of their
90:28 - situation in life their economic
90:30 - situation as long as they have uh any
90:33 - sort of internet connection even if it's
90:34 - a really crappy internet connection free
90:36 - cocan Core Curriculum is extremely data
90:39 - light and that's by okay design so that
90:41 - people that are out in in the area where
90:43 - we don't have Broadband 20% of Americans
90:45 - don't have Broadband yet W in 20124
90:48 - right and that that says nothing about
90:50 - the people living in rural Asia rural
90:53 - Africa uh you know Ral Latin America
90:56 - like don't take that for granted and we
90:58 - don't take that for granted we want to
90:59 - make sure but I I do want to point out
91:01 - that we've got some excellent Gary Simon
91:05 - uh stuff on Freo Camp's YouTube channel
91:08 - including uh this excellent video where
91:10 - you go through and you essentially like
91:12 - critique designs we published that way
91:15 - back in 2020 but I'm going to link to
91:17 - that in the show notes be sure to check
91:19 - those out learn more from Gary see him
91:21 - in action um so some of the things I
91:24 - want to talk about in terms of getting
91:25 - skills uh what skills should people
91:29 - learn in 2024 what are like the tools
91:32 - that you would recommend if you want to
91:33 - get into web design or you know
91:36 - front-end development like hybrid kind
91:38 - of ux UI design right yeah so you have a
91:41 - lot of options fortunately um it depends
91:43 - on what route you want to take so if
91:45 - we're talking about a website designer
91:47 - or the monit term like a uiux designer
91:50 - what skills do you need and what
91:51 - software do you need so I would say in
91:54 - terms of skills you have to understand
91:55 - the fundamentals of of UI design first
91:59 - and that includes and depending on who
92:00 - you're asking they might say there's
92:01 - five there's six or seven you know
92:03 - that's things like understanding
92:05 - contrast to these are in no particular
92:07 - order um
92:09 - topography understanding uh color
92:11 - psychology a little bit um understanding
92:13 - what color contrast is understanding
92:15 - what alignment means in UI design
92:18 - understand what visual hierarchy like
92:19 - all these fundamentals understand the
92:21 - basics first before you start try to
92:23 - getting into the fancy stuff yeah um in
92:26 - in in terms of the software well I the
92:30 - most popular UI ux design prototyping
92:33 - software is figma um but you can also go
92:36 - the um opr Source route with penot they
92:39 - just released um penot penot 2.0 that's
92:43 - pen p and that's an that is basically a
92:46 - direct figma competitor and they work
92:49 - very similarly so if you don't have you
92:51 - don't want to have to spend money on
92:53 - figma which you can get a free figma
92:55 - account uh it's just like they have paid
92:57 - plans and stuff like that if you don't
92:59 - want to do that you can go the pen pot
93:00 - route so if you're interested in
93:02 - designing websites and apps like the
93:04 - actual user
93:06 - interfaces that those are the tools that
93:08 - I would recommend um learning for that
93:11 - aspect alone I you don't get a website
93:14 - that works in your browser with figma or
93:17 - penot but that's the first thing that
93:21 - you typically want to work with because
93:23 - you want to get an idea of what your
93:25 - design looks like first before you start
93:27 - coding and I know that's some people
93:29 - prefer not to do that but my my my
93:32 - position on that is is if you you want
93:36 - to use something like figma or pen pot
93:38 - uh because it allows you to very quickly
93:41 - move things around and iterate and get
93:43 - and iterate over it and get quick ideas
93:45 - without having to type code first to try
93:47 - to design while and if you're doing a
93:49 - really basic cookie cutter landing page
93:51 - and you kind of have a a quick idea of
93:53 - what you want that's fine but if you
93:55 - want to be a serious UI uxer then you
93:58 - learn either figma or pen poot or any of
94:00 - the other competitor software out there
94:02 - yeah um and and then if you want to take
94:06 - if we're talking about maybe front end
94:08 - development then you have you have two
94:10 - choices today you can learn HTML CSS
94:13 - from scratch in JavaScript if you want
94:15 - some
94:16 - interactivity um and I I really
94:18 - recommend people taking the time to
94:20 - understand at least the basics or you
94:22 - can go the low to no code route with a
94:24 - tool like framer web flow Wix Studio I
94:28 - there's a couple other ones there's like
94:30 - dora. a I believe um and that's a that's
94:33 - an approach where you can design your
94:36 - website and you can also get it up there
94:39 - on you know on devices and browsers
94:42 - without touching code and the the ones
94:45 - like that I mentioned like framer and
94:46 - web flow they're so Advanced now um in
94:50 - in in the capabilities like allowing you
94:52 - to to create scroll based interactions
94:54 - and animations that it's a really good
94:56 - tool for people who just don't want to
94:58 - code but they love designing uh so
95:01 - that's an option as well yeah and uh so
95:05 - that's really cool that you're
95:06 - essentially presenting two paths you can
95:09 - start with the design and just use
95:12 - powerful power tools essentially like uh
95:15 - you mentioned framer Dora Wix web flow
95:18 - or right you can actually learn the
95:21 - fundamental skills that are like
95:23 - basically that
95:24 - are going to be the output of these
95:26 - power tools they're going to Output like
95:28 - CSS files and HTML files and JS but uh
95:32 - if you want to focus on design first it
95:34 - makes sense to go with the power tools
95:37 - where you can rapidly iterate and you
95:38 - can use that before you get into the
95:40 - nitty-gritty right right and and and of
95:42 - course learning the HTML CSS JavaScript
95:45 - and then tacking on to that you know
95:47 - learning maybe react or view or
95:50 - something like that uh you could take
95:52 - that you could take that route and it's
95:54 - going to ultimately give you more
95:56 - flexibility in the end to do things from
95:59 - scratch and some like larger client
96:01 - higher paying uh projects that have
96:04 - specific requirements where that's only
96:06 - possible that that's where it's going to
96:08 - benefit you um the most but if if you
96:11 - just want to frame yourself as a web
96:13 - flow designer which many people do you
96:15 - can have a career out of that alone I
96:18 - would be a little bit worried tying
96:19 - yourself to one piece of software
96:21 - because they can die out and you know I
96:23 - but it that's why as long as you have
96:25 - those UI design skills they're going to
96:27 - transfer easily from app to app because
96:30 - when it comes to being able to design a
96:31 - greatl looking user interface for an app
96:34 - or a website it's less about the tools
96:37 - it's more about your your eye and your
96:39 - you know and it's like a 90 10 a 90% 10%
96:44 - 10% tool knowledge 90% everything else
96:48 - that takes a lot more longer to to yeah
96:50 - like the actual taste you develop the
96:54 - of atics right um and and the creative
96:57 - reps that you get to be able to just
96:59 - come up with something that looks novel
97:00 - like like an artist sits in front of a
97:02 - blank canvas and just starts you know
97:05 - adding detail and they've got this
97:06 - Vision in their mind right most people
97:08 - if they haven't never done that before
97:09 - they don't even know what what do I
97:10 - paint you know where I begin it's
97:13 - interesting because this is I I call it
97:16 - I I don't know if this is a real term I
97:17 - call it the Observer Creator problem you
97:20 - know we're we're all great critics you
97:23 - know because we've for instance like
97:25 - well I'll put it in the context of I
97:27 - like guitar um because I play guitar I
97:30 - you can hear and Rec anybody can
97:32 - recognize a great guitar solo you know
97:35 - if if if a person gets one note wrong it
97:37 - just stands out so bad you know so we're
97:40 - great observers because we've listened
97:42 - to and we we've been subjected to music
97:44 - for so long but the moment you ask
97:46 - somebody to pick up a guitar and and do
97:48 - a solo even if I give gave them six
97:51 - months to try to learn the Eruption solo
97:53 - by Van
97:54 - but guitar solo
97:57 - ever include at least one bum note in it
98:00 - by the way he which is that I I can't
98:03 - remember but he he said he made a
98:05 - mistake when he recorded it but this was
98:07 - the old days they just like cool
98:09 - whatever we got to get this album cut
98:11 - time money you know like those Van Halen
98:13 - albums so we're talking about Van Halen
98:15 - one the very first Van Halen uh album
98:19 - and uh Eddie Van Halen of course
98:21 - legendary guitar player uh just created
98:23 - this amazing solo that uses like finger
98:26 - tapping which was novel at the time I
98:27 - don't think it was a widespread or
98:29 - well-known practice and uh it's just
98:31 - this incredible solo um but uh those
98:35 - albums they would record them live like
98:37 - they would go in the studio everybody
98:39 - would be playing maybe the drums would
98:40 - have some plexiglass or something around
98:42 - them but like people just played it and
98:44 - they practiced so much that they could
98:45 - just cut an album quality version of
98:48 - that performance and immortalize it on
98:50 - the album at least for the first two or
98:52 - three albums they did that so so um but
98:54 - but he said he did actually make like a
98:56 - very minor mistake but it was good
98:58 - enough so they just shipped it yeah
99:00 - there's some parts in that so that are
99:02 - so fast it's like it's open to
99:04 - interpretation but um but yeah so going
99:06 - back to my point though it's like
99:08 - they're going to have they're not going
99:09 - to be able to do it in six months and
99:11 - then you asked them to to create a soul
99:13 - of similar caliber you're not going to
99:15 - be able to do it either um and and that
99:17 - that that exists because observing is
99:20 - very much different because logically
99:22 - speaking wait I can recognize that this
99:24 - website looks great now if I try to
99:26 - create my own why does it look way worse
99:29 - like why doesn't this transfer and it's
99:31 - because doing is very different there
99:33 - are different neurop Pathways um when it
99:36 - comes to observing because you say wow
99:38 - that website looks great and then you
99:39 - try to it's like a 10 out of 10 and then
99:40 - you do it it's like a three out of 10 as
99:42 - a beginner and that's expected though a
99:45 - lot of people get tripped up like this I
99:47 - I just suck at this I I quit you know
99:49 - because I look at what I I could produce
99:51 - and they don't give themselves enough
99:52 - time because they don't understand
99:54 - upfront beforehand that you have to
99:58 - practice a lot and you have to bake this
99:59 - stuff into muscle memory and one and one
100:02 - of the greatest ways and this is a great
100:03 - parallel with guitar players and web
100:06 - designers is one of the ways that I
100:09 - advocate to get good with guitar and
100:11 - design is to Simply copy others so in in
100:15 - Guitar World we call it covers so I
100:17 - learned the eruption Van Halen you know
100:19 - solo I and that's called a cover and I
100:22 - learned it because well a I I think it
100:25 - it sounds great and I want to be able to
100:27 - do that myself I but B it's also going
100:30 - to help transfers that style into my
100:33 - brain so that I can interpret it and
100:36 - work into my own new ideas and that's
100:39 - what art is it's imitation right so the
100:42 - same concept applies to um design so
100:45 - like if you see a design that looks
100:47 - great well try to try to reverse
100:49 - engineer it and create it not as a
100:52 - something to put in your portfolio of
100:53 - course but literally cop it copy it
100:56 - pixel by pixel as a as a practice
100:58 - routine and I've done videos on this
101:00 - this concept and you'll find that uh
101:03 - physically you know working in figma or
101:05 - pen pot and recreating a design that's
101:07 - maybe on your other monitor or something
101:08 - and you're trying to you know piece it
101:10 - together exactly how they did it that
101:12 - actually it bakes itself into your I
101:16 - your your own future work um and then so
101:19 - that you can eventually develop your
101:20 - your own little style and when it comes
101:23 - to uiux design there's a lot of patterns
101:25 - so you can't really be too crazy uh but
101:27 - you can still develop your own style and
101:29 - your own your own things that are unique
101:32 - even though you're copying initially and
101:34 - and as just a means for practice and
101:36 - learning yeah let's talk about some of
101:39 - the design Trends you did this great
101:40 - video a while back like like you do this
101:42 - pretty pretty frequently like you you'll
101:44 - review different designs you'll just
101:47 - have just open up your browser and you
101:48 - got like a bunch of tabs open and you'll
101:50 - talk about it like and and some of the
101:52 - the e
101:57 - curs scrolling Mouse it's triggering
102:01 - some sort of Parallax effect or
102:04 - uncovering something or there's some
102:05 - sort of Animation that progresses as you
102:07 - scroll like like I'm curious about what
102:10 - you think like the big exciting Trends
102:12 - in design are um and uh what people who
102:17 - are designing should look out for right
102:19 - yeah so right now I would say in 2024
102:22 - like the current trends that I'm seeing
102:24 - is like well load and no code is like
102:26 - getting bigger in my opinion um now of
102:29 - course that doesn't have anything to say
102:30 - with actual athetics um I in terms of
102:33 - like web design Trends you know I try to
102:37 - Ju Just for the purpose of keeping up
102:38 - to- date and fresh on YouTube I'll I'll
102:41 - do these a couple times a year like
102:43 - maybe once a year like 2024 design
102:45 - Trends or whatever but typically when it
102:49 - comes to uiux design and design Trends
102:51 - in general you don't see big changes in
102:53 - a year-to-year basis you might have one
102:57 - tiny little thing that picks up like
102:59 - glass morphism you know where people are
103:01 - making some of their UI cards look
103:03 - glassy or whatever uh but in terms of
103:06 - the big macro Trends usually it's like a
103:08 - s to 10 year period that we see things
103:10 - change like largely and the what we're
103:14 - seeing now in my opinion is there's a
103:16 - there's a big emphasis on um interaction
103:19 - and motion design and I think those
103:21 - things are great when you implement them
103:24 - where it makes sense um you don't want
103:26 - that stuff on an e-commerce website for
103:29 - your client uh or if it's a Content
103:31 - heavy website you don't want to have all
103:33 - that but if we're talking about landing
103:35 - pages and portfolios which was my
103:37 - personal thing that I like the most like
103:40 - SAS landing pages and stuff and and
103:42 - creating those type of things then
103:44 - interaction and animations I are play a
103:47 - good role and there's a definitely a
103:49 - skill and being able to apply those with
103:51 - accessibility of mine and also speed and
103:54 - use your experience in mind there is a
103:56 - middle ground to you know some say uh
103:59 - just don't do anything and if you're not
104:00 - good at motion design then yeah just
104:03 - keep it static uh you have to spend time
104:05 - to learn these things because it's a
104:06 - skill um just like making the website
104:09 - itself look good that's a skill like
104:11 - with all those fundamentals uh motion
104:14 - design that's definitely a skill as well
104:15 - both in terms of how you apply it with
104:17 - your animation timing and eases and all
104:19 - that stuff but also technically how you
104:21 - implement it um with things like green
104:23 - sock animation platform or you can do
104:25 - some of those in a limited context
104:27 - within framer and let the load of no
104:29 - code tools so going back to that I so
104:32 - animation interactivity is a big thing I
104:35 - think
104:36 - topography I'm experimenting with
104:38 - topography and also in getting out of
104:40 - flat design now because back we we had
104:43 - Web 2.0 which I think was 29 to 2009 is
104:48 - to like 2014 like that seems to be the
104:51 - window of Two web 2 2 out I think I I'm
104:54 - sure some people might disagree a little
104:55 - bit but yeah um that's when you know
104:58 - everybody was using gradients and drop
105:00 - shadows and strokes and glows and
105:03 - everything was just like you know there
105:05 - was very little flat you know it was
105:07 - kind of like skew morphism essentially
105:09 - and so then we had material design from
105:12 - Google came out and that was like oh
105:14 - this is all flat like they're just using
105:16 - solid colors everywhere and that that
105:18 - was a great I think we needed that the
105:20 - pendulum swung the other way into
105:23 - complete flat design for a while which
105:25 - is great for ux but then creativity I be
105:28 - believe began to suffer a little bit
105:30 - every website almost look the same so
105:31 - now I think we're seeing a push back
105:33 - against that to where we're seeing
105:35 - things like more colorful websites thick
105:38 - um I strokes and we're doing things that
105:41 - we T typically didn't do before and
105:44 - that's just a natural progression of of
105:46 - design Trends um I don't think anything
105:48 - major is going to happen until we get
105:50 - something like you know um the the VR
105:53 - stuff and the AR stuff to take off I
105:56 - kind of like how we did with um the
105:59 - first iPhone that was a fundamental
106:01 - change it required a big change in how
106:03 - we approach design um and so until we
106:06 - get to that point I'm not sure if
106:08 - there's going to be something else
106:09 - outside of that but until we get to that
106:11 - point we'll just see small incremental
106:13 - changes in terms of how we approach uiux
106:15 - until the technology really changes and
106:17 - shifts awesome so in other words if I
106:19 - can kind of very succinctly put what
106:22 - what you just said mhm don't worry too
106:24 - much about it focus on the fundamentals
106:26 - and the ground's not shifting like it
106:28 - might seem like it's shifting yeah but
106:30 - right yeah right the so like learning
106:33 - color theory learning typography
106:35 - learning these like where where would
106:36 - people learn some of these you cover
106:38 - this in in some of your courses y so I
106:41 - have I every year I do a free uiux
106:44 - design C crash course and front end
106:45 - develop there're two separate things I
106:48 - and I teach that I always make it a
106:49 - point to teach that a little bit in the
106:51 - crash courses so you completely learn
106:53 - that stuff for free obviously there's so
106:55 - many other sources um outside of me uh
106:58 - but my uiux design course which is a
107:00 - paid course that covers that there's an
107:02 - entire like mini course dedicated to the
107:04 - fundamentals in that course um and I
107:08 - have parody pricing and all that stuff
107:09 - so it's pricing meaning that if somebody
107:11 - is from like a low-income country y then
107:14 - they can it'll knock like it'll knock
107:17 - off like 40% but yeah yeah that's cool
107:19 - awesome well we can we can put a link to
107:22 - that below as well anybody wants to try
107:24 - out that course um and uh what do you
107:27 - think about some of the AI tools you had
107:29 - this great video that I watched uh where
107:32 - you were looking at some of framer's AI
107:33 - tools and I think maybe they use the
107:36 - term AI a little liberally when it it
107:39 - sounds but what is AI really we've had
107:41 - AI since you know early chess engines
107:43 - and things like that but obviously like
107:46 - generative AI tools coming up with quote
107:49 - unquote creative stuff from Whole cloth
107:51 - and things like that uh
107:53 - what do you think about those AI tools
107:54 - are there any that have really impressed
107:56 - you right yeah so of course the the the
107:58 - one that's really impressed me impressed
108:00 - everybody like when mid Journey came out
108:03 - um just for generating images and the
108:06 - main use case that I see that being used
108:08 - and I it's integrated into my workflow I
108:11 - because I I will use mid journey to
108:14 - create assets whereas otherwise in the
108:16 - past I might have used something like
108:17 - unsplash.com which is like a free image
108:20 - you know resource that these are actual
108:22 - photographs that humans took um and
108:25 - what's really cool is like the prompt
108:27 - that you issue within Discord to
108:29 - interact with mid Journey um and it just
108:31 - keeps getting better and better I'm able
108:33 - to quickly generate an asset like an
108:36 - abstract like website background like
108:39 - some type of weird gradient or something
108:41 - and so youed have really fun
108:42 - experimenting with it and you can get
108:44 - some really good results with it um
108:46 - realistic or otherwise uh if you want
108:48 - them in any style um so that mid journey
108:51 - I use that a lot I also um would
108:54 - Advocate using Adobe illustrators a
108:57 - relatively new um vector-based
109:02 - I AI prompt generation platform it it's
109:06 - really cool because before we couldn't
109:09 - get vector-based um AI assets but now
109:12 - you can do that of course you could do
109:14 - that if you if you did the uh um what do
109:17 - you call the bit map to Vector process
109:21 - but usually
109:23 - artifacts yeah you get artifacts it' be
109:25 - tough to do um just just for the benefit
109:28 - of the audience when we say Vector we're
109:29 - talking about like an SVG file or
109:31 - something where it's like geometry as
109:34 - opposed to you know pixels right yeah so
109:38 - like if you a good way to describe the
109:40 - difference between like a raster graphic
109:42 - or like a bitmap graphic and a vector
109:44 - graph is if you like you zoom up on a
109:46 - photograph that you take on your phone
109:48 - like you'll see pixelation blurriness it
109:50 - doesn't look like good quality that's
109:51 - rastered um Vector doesn't have that but
109:54 - Vector of course you don't use Vector
109:56 - for like high resolution photographs you
109:59 - use it for like illustration and stuff
110:01 - and on websites you have icons you have
110:04 - little illustrations sometimes and Adobe
110:06 - illustrators um Vector generate AI
110:09 - generation tool is pretty solid
110:11 - depending on what you're trying to get
110:12 - it to generate so let's say
110:13 - hypothetically I wanted to have like a
110:15 - quill uh like I've got I want to have
110:18 - some old timey you know uh Renaissance
110:21 - Era um kind of broke music website a
110:25 - different musical period but like let's
110:27 - say that I I want to have like uh you
110:30 - know leave a note in the guest book or
110:32 - something like that I have a quill like
110:34 - I could go to Adobe and essentially
110:35 - prompt it like hey I need a a vector
110:37 - graphic of a quill and it should be
110:39 - tilted n degrees and it should be you
110:41 - know um it should have ink dripping from
110:45 - it or something like that I would use
110:47 - that yeah and I yeah and it would come
110:49 - all like four variations and sometimes
110:51 - it's bad and and sometimes it's it's
110:53 - really good and they allow you specify
110:55 - different styles so I would I would I
110:57 - would use that um not as much as I use
111:00 - mid Journey um because there's like in
111:02 - icons there's already so many icons that
111:04 - are very welld designed and you can't
111:06 - really get.com icons is like a website
111:08 - I've used I don't know if you have
111:09 - something better than that that you'd
111:10 - recommend yeah I I can't I'm not off the
111:13 - top of my head these days um but so
111:16 - those are two like graphic based tools
111:18 - uh I would use AI for um but I would
111:20 - also use chat GPT and L Ms for in
111:23 - general
111:24 - um and that could be as simple as like
111:27 - trying to get website copy you know
111:29 - that's the obvious one so you're not
111:30 - using laurum ipsum everywhere um but but
111:33 - also to come up with with ideas like
111:36 - perhaps even you don't want to rely on
111:38 - re on on these large language models too
111:42 - much like for like research you know the
111:44 - the research as aspect of like ux design
111:48 - uh but it's it's
111:49 - certainly a tool that's available um for
111:52 - you to to help assist you when you're
111:54 - trying to build a website or something
111:56 - even if it's a technical question or not
111:59 - uh so as a front-end developer you can
112:00 - ask chat GPT questions but just
112:03 - understand that it does get things wrong
112:05 - you know at times but if you have basic
112:07 - questions it's it's a great resource in
112:10 - my my I use it every day I I used to
112:13 - learn a little bit of music theory and I
112:16 - I can you can ask it questions or as
112:18 - long as they're General basic questions
112:20 - you're not asking it to make like a
112:21 - Facebook clone you you're good to go t
112:23 - typically all so that's the main ways
112:26 - write down that I personally use AI I in
112:30 - in my uiux workflow awesome well uh
112:34 - We've covered so much ground here I I do
112:36 - have a question that I want to ask you
112:39 - uh you've often said that that uh you
112:42 - you live
112:45 - fearlessly what does that mean and and
112:48 - why is it that uh you've chosen to live
112:51 - fearlessly well
112:53 - I'm going to be honest with you I'm not
112:54 - sure when I said that specifically but
112:57 - I'll give you a really good uh I'll give
112:59 - you an answer that makes sense to me
113:01 - because it actually it kind of aligns
113:03 - with you know like a recent I guess you
113:06 - could say transformation of my thought
113:08 - process and how I approach stuff in
113:10 - general I you know
113:13 - I for me I guess I I I finally
113:18 - understood that you know I I was a
113:20 - hypochondriac and so I was always
113:22 - worried about like Health ailments and
113:25 - which was really stupid because I was an
113:26 - alcoholic you know it's like how why are
113:29 - you drinking alcohol every night when
113:31 - you're worried about your health or
113:32 - whatever and and then F finally slowly I
113:35 - I shed that uh because I started going
113:37 - down this Rabbit Hole I know this is
113:38 - completely off topic but of of
113:40 - near-death experiences and and I chose
113:43 - to believe these people that are having
113:44 - these near-death experiences that's like
113:46 - one of the greatest thing that's ever
113:47 - happened to them like 95% of them say
113:49 - it's like the greatest thing ever you
113:50 - know what I I I decided to stop worrying
113:53 - about my health because hey I'm pretty
113:56 - healthy now you know I don't drink
113:57 - anymore and I I I run and lift a lot I
114:01 - but even even like as recently as two
114:04 - years ago like I was just worried about
114:05 - you know like if I had one small thing
114:08 - wrong with me healthwise it's because I
114:09 - have cancer or I have this or that and I
114:12 - finally stopped that and I don't have
114:14 - hypochondria anymore and because I
114:17 - believe you know when I die it's going
114:19 - to be I it's going to be a continuation
114:22 - of my Consciousness and so what I'm
114:24 - finding now is that I am living life in
114:28 - less fear in general just by having that
114:30 - Mantra in my mind like I'm not just
114:32 - going to die and rot there in the ground
114:34 - and that's it I that gives me Comfort
114:37 - and so I understand atheists might be
114:39 - like you know because I was an atheist
114:41 - and I'm still kind of am but I'm more
114:42 - spiritual now so I don't subscribe to
114:44 - his particular religion uh but for me
114:47 - like I said I I I live life fearlessly
114:50 - now in that context I of where I'm not
114:54 - I'm not stressing over everything
114:55 - because I I I I think this is just I for
114:58 - me just to to to better myself why on
115:01 - this time in the planet and so that
115:03 - that's what I that I that my new mantra
115:05 - is that so I hopefully that was a
115:08 - sufficient answer awes different than
115:10 - what you're talk expecting I mean
115:12 - congratulations on stopping drinking uh
115:14 - I'm very outspoken about the fact that I
115:16 - haven't had a drink since my daughter
115:17 - was born you know eight plus years ago
115:20 - and I have no intention of ever drinking
115:21 - again I just I I love just being in the
115:23 - moment present unadulterated and uh you
115:26 - know overcoming hypochondria like that
115:29 - can be absolutely paralyzing
115:30 - congratulations to you for figuring out
115:33 - a way to like push past that and be able
115:36 - to live your life man right yeah it it's
115:39 - been such an amazing experience learning
115:41 - from you both about like freelancing
115:44 - design uh and of course just your
115:47 - ridiculous work ethic and how you've
115:49 - been so uh productive over the past 20
115:52 - years uh again I encourage everybody to
115:56 - learn from this guy I I've learned a lot
115:58 - from him I enjoy just uh be sure to
116:00 - watch his video of him playing guitar
116:02 - just great uh great video great video
116:05 - production and I'm very excited when I
116:08 - make it out there I'm going to hang out
116:10 - at your studio oh yeah sure if you have
116:12 - like a a fender P base or something like
116:14 - that like I'll just grab the base and
116:16 - let's jam cuz uh yeah let me let me t
116:18 - let me tilt the camera real quick yeah
116:20 - let's check it out let's check it out
116:22 - all right
116:22 - so uh I'm just going to verbally
116:24 - describe what we're seeing we're looking
116:25 - at a wall anybody listen something
116:28 - popped up on my screen is like something
116:30 - about the internet connection okay no it
116:31 - seems fine uh and uh whoa dude I mean
116:37 - you've got like those Fearless flyer
116:39 - style guitar stands that like just hold
116:41 - your guitar in position so you don't
116:43 - have to use a strap you've got like a
116:44 - full-blown movie theater looking thing
116:47 - and you got this that's a big uh screen
116:49 - back there yeah I mean it is how how
116:52 - tall is the ceiling in there it's
116:53 - probably at least like 15 ft it is 16
116:56 - feet 16 feet yeah it's just giant Studio
116:59 - it's amazing uh beautiful wallpaper yeah
117:04 - I might be like
117:06 - tilted yeah so uh Gary it's been such an
117:09 - amazing experience we even get a preview
117:11 - of the studio which you'll see a lot
117:12 - more of if you subscribe to Gary's
117:16 - website to his YouTube definitely do
117:18 - that I'll have a link to that and uh
117:21 - yeah man it's been a pleasure to talk
117:23 - with you for the past two hours get such
117:25 - a huge injection of insight from you man
117:29 - you as well yeah this has been one of
117:31 - the kind of like a bucket list thing to
117:33 - have an interview with Quincy Larson
117:34 - which is awesome uh so yeah enjoyed it
117:37 - very much though awesome man well
117:39 - everybody who's listening hope you have
117:41 - a fantastic week until next week happy
117:44 - coding

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to the free C Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we're talking with developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week I'm joined by Gary Simon founder of designc course.com designer extraordinaire guitar virtuoso and uh just amazing allaround uh expert on freelancing on web design on using contemporary tools just getting things done and uh he's got like more than a million YouTube subscribers on his channel he's been at this for a very long time and he's carved a path for himself and I think there's a great deal we can learn from him Gary welcome thanks for that awesome intro yeah we're so thrilled to have you here man I'm like I'm a longterm like longtime admirer of the work you do the production of the videos the level of insight uh just you know how it's great watching you do like a tear down of a website and like look at like the different design decisions that were made yeah thanks no know and and the feeling is mutual of course I mean 9 million subscribers on YouTube I mean it can't be that so yeah I'm very excited for this uh to have this conversation yeah well I want to start off by just talking like a lot of people have heard the term web design it used to be the main term that people talk about in terms of getting things on the web now you heard the term web development but the but web design and web development are kind of two distinct disciplines that you know web design still exists it's it's completely different set of skills right right right so like back in the day when I started maybe we started uh you know was like in the early '90s to to late 90s and I we had the term Web Master back then so I was like a web master I think and I think that's I think that that's the term I used I call myself a Web Master even though yeah and I was I was doing design and code back then but I for me yeah a web designer the way I give that definition it's essentially somebody who's dealing mainly with the Aesthetics uh and if to to break that down more specifically you could say UI ux designer um for me web development is a is a term that would could possibly include web design or like the design aspect depending on who you ask but uh for me if I'm talking about development I'm I'm probably talking about front end development and and backend and stuff like that yeah Okay cool so Aesthetics how would you define Aesthetics and uh as like like let's pretend okay okay there are probably a lot of people listening to this who don't even have you know the faculty of site like we have a lot of blind people in the free cocing community like how would you describe Aesthetics well unless I'm wrong about the definition of Aesthetics I you for me it would be uh the the visual aspect of building you know a digital project like a website or an app or a SAS you know and so the the tools for that for me would be figma perhaps I so when I say aesthetic even when I'm referring to like bodybuilding I'm saying what does that look like so for me if I'm talking about the Aesthetics of a website I I'm talking about the visual aspect um I'm not sure if that is consistent with the correct definition uh because I know you you you precluded that by individuals who can't you know who can't see or have a hard time you know seeing a website but that's that's how I traditionally have approached that that definition yeah that makes a lot of sense how did you build up your sense of Aesthetics over the years um right so so um I've been designing for a real long time and I've always been artistic I like to draw as a kid you know not to say that you have to be artistic for UI design uh because you don't have to be but for me um you know I've always you know we could talk about this a little bit more down the road but you know in in the late mid to late 90s I I was just fascinated by early computer Graphics back then like Photoshop 2.0 had these lightning bolt strikes and stuff and I in terms of developing my current taste and how it's transformed over years and such uh that's just a matter of experience you know once you start playing around with things and Building Things designing things you'll develop your own sense of what makes you tick you know I'm a big fan of like minimalism but also scifi and so I that I kind of work that sometimes we're appropriate but that I like that sort of stuff just kind of like we all have our own musical tastes you know in terms of we can also have our taste as well awesome yeah well let's you know let's talk about that early those early experiences oh yeah with computers because I I know you're like a big fan of kind of like retro Computing Aesthetics and uh you know there's a great video that I'm going to link to in the show notes I'll be linking to a lot of the things that Gary brings up during this conversation but uh it's it's like right before the year 2020 and it's just Gary uh jamming out on the guitar with this really cool kind of like uh I I mean if anybody's seen the movie Kung Fury like it's just got that kind of like Dusty smoke fil dark kind of like school computer yeah yeah yeah it's great yeah yeah I can't wait to utilize the new studio to do more crazy stuff but but yeah we'll talk about that but yeah how I got started with computers yeah I mean you grew up in Ohio yes yeah which is in the middle of America pretty much like it's Northeastern it's it's right under it's right attached to the Great Lakes Lake Erie and yeah yeah so like a lot of people have probably not been out there like I've never been there it's it's what is it like is it like uh you know it's just like a it's a rural you know and I've only lived like within a a 10 mile radius my entire life I've probably been four or five places but I it's it's very like where I live now I it's like I have a horse farm across the street my neighbors are far away I have eight Acres that's that's that's what we like my wife and I um we did live in the city and it of course it's not a big city there's like 36,000 people there um but people were just close together and I I like having space you know and that was kind of how I grew up as well early on yeah yeah well as I uh as listeners to the show know I grew up in Oklahoma City and it it is similar like in it's just like less dense right yeah you would drive on your way to school you might drive by right an actual Farm oh yeah yeah yeah I run past them all the time yeah so um maybe you can talk about those early days like what you were into as a kid I mean you mentioned you drew a lot yeah I was into art um I was also into baseball you know I was a pitcher and I I went I I played all the way up until about e8th grade and I stopped because I became too obsessed with computers um and so yeah I ran and I you know I was athletic and and then I wasn't because the computers took over yeah uh and and my first introduction to computers was uh my friend actually he showed me AOL um on his computer I didn't we didn't have a home computer and I was like what is this and it was dial up we didn't have cable modem back then and I just thought it was amazing those private rooms everybody's talking with each other so I begged my parents for a computer and they bought me a nice computer it was like $2,000 back then and I and and I started getting into that and then I started playing Doom I my sister's boyfriend brought over the five you know hard diss of Doom to install Doom the floppy disc you had they had this cool like Doss in your face where it would show the progress bar and so I played that and then I I I realized you can actually make levels and so that's my very first taste of any type of development creating things on the computer was making Doom too levels it had their own little apps and stuff and it was complex too it was hard and and um and then I got into uh AOL a bit more um creating programs pries as they were called The Very irritating things that where you could kick people offline and freeze their computer and like I just thought that was the funnest thing to do to my friends and in order to do that you had to learn Visual Basic and and that is my first step into actual development of any sort and that's hardcore I desktop development and you I had to learn it and and I learned a Visual Basic API programming and it it was just something that a 13 14 yearold's doing it's like what is happening I and I learned a lot from that yes I learned a lot from that CU basically these little pries as they were called or prags I they they were separate desktop applications that you ran on your computer and you click buttons and it would literally control the interface of AOL so if you had a friend screen name and they were online right now and you wanted to like freeze their computer you could send like this IM spam to them automatically and it just froze their computer and like we just thought it was hilarious uh but in doing that and being you know a terribly annoying teenager I I learned how to code actually and I liked it it was fun um and challenging I shortly after that is when I started oh designing web pages and and that's that was kind of that I left that stuff behind fortunately I and I got into designing web pages yeah yeah I remember back in the day I think my friend had something called AO hell oh yes little scripts that you could use to like troll people about five six years ago I did a video kind of showing all the old AOL prags as they are called um and yeah trip down memory lane the designs of these UI are just horrendous it's hilarious but I that's how we learned back then yeah well um let's talk about like just so you you've abandoned baseball uh and just gone deep into the underworld of trolling people on AOL building Doom wads if I recall correctly wads yeah wad files awesome and and man like the degree of artistic expression within that game it was just incredible I saw the most incredible mods for Doom cuz I played the heck out of Doom I I remember like I believe the only time I did I actually like ate up like more than one day without sleep was when I first got the Doom shareware uh and I just remember walking around and just being like this is incredible for like I don't think I slept for like two days yeah had I was having so much fun the book was like this thick of like how to make Doom levels it was amazing like there was it was such a fascinating world and I was never good like really good it was just a young kid doing it I but I knew then I was like this is so exciting just creating stuff on a computer you know and that's what got me into it um and like I said then then the web page stuff came along and we're talking about like front page 97 or front page 98 microft like you don't need to learn HTML or css anymore yeah is that funny thinking at the time yeah yeah yeah and I didn't you know I I didn't know HTML CSS not I never typed in a notepad I my friend locally did I was like you're hardcore you know I I didn't do that stuff I you know I'm talking about like 99 98 99 2000 or so mhm and and so I used front page 98 and then um and then we switch I upgraded my workflow to uh back then it was macr media Dream Weaver I think yes and uh Adobe of course bought them a while later but macr media Dream Weaver uh my workflow for designing websites used to look like this they use Adobe photosop to design it think of that like as the old school figma yeah except it was never meant for designing website interfaces but that's what people did that's all we had uh so you design your mockup in that first your website mockup and then you would step into Adobe fireworks which may have been a macromedia product as well I I forget and fireworks you import that and then you do your slices so you kind of cut up with this slice tool again there's no programming here or coding at all H and you slice it up and then you hit export and it would export your website for you in these sliced frames and then you take it into something like Dream Weaver and then you would have to kind of finetune it uh so that it makes sense on a website and not everything is image slices right if that makes sense so there was a whole workflow and that I did that for a while as well yeah I mean like early 2000s if you go back and look at like the early CocaCola website uh or other Big Brand websites they had pretty elaborate looking websites way even way back in like the late '90s early 2000s but they were a lot of images everywhere right they have this really cool typography but it's really just like a little Fir and they were all and when these tools like fireworks would export your your page it was all structured and scaffolded by tables HTML table the element so everything was based on tables back then we didn't have like divs and stuff yeah U so it was interesting and and you had your white space controlled by the cbls by the thickness of the cells and all this it was interesting entirely different way you know different times in terms of how we approach design you know right now but even in doing that I still was developing my sense for UI design because that's timeless it was all the same concept you're just designing for one screen size essentially like 800 by 600 back then it was Tiny um and so yeah even even those very early days still probably impact what I do today in some weird way yeah yeah uh that's interesting to hear that like even though the tools have changed a whole lot the uh considerations uh I mean using the web is just 100 times better of a user experience in 2024 than it was back then in the sense that everything is like you go to a website you get up you go pour a cup of coffee or something because it's going to take a while for like all the assets to load you have to be careful about what you click on because you go to a different web page and you have to wait for things to load right yeah and go ahead I was just going to say the aesthetic back in like the the there used to be like these portal websites like Yahoo which I believe still exists U where you would it's just a giant list of everything on one page because they know like right like page load takes a long time and like every click is kind of like Precious so like let's put everything right in front of and to this day if you look at like a lot of Chinese websites a lot of Japanese websites they are incredibly like content dense compared to like you know us websites right right yeah and we had some bad practices too early on like a lot of us we were doing Splash Pages you know we just had a splash page for your portfolio some type of interesting graphic you made in Photoshop enter here and you click enter here it's like the most unnecessary thing now we still have that on some of these even Awards like winning websites uh but fortunately that's not the de facto and and a lot of people did that you know a lot of our startup web designers like click here to enter it's your splash page you know you got to have the splash page it's like no you don't but but then we also had flash around the same time and Flash was real interesting because you know like you said the big companies they knew I what you were talking what you were just talking about we need to get people the information fast but back then if you were a teenager you wanted glitzy crazy Graphics you wanted crazy animations and that's what we took advantage of with flash uh and Flash you know for those of you who aren't watching maybe you're too young it was just uh it was a really fun way to create animated interactive websites uh and you could do some really cool things with flash like special graphics and effects that was just groundbreaking back then um and so in one way looking back on it you know we were approaching it probably the wrong way I a lot of us aspiring designers back then because we were really just probably utilizing way too much page load time because of the dialup modems like they didn't not afford you you know a lot of room to work with and so you had to be careful with all those the audio clicks on the UI you know you click a button you want to sound Ur you know it's like all this stuff was just taking way too way too long to load essentially yeah uh so that's something we had to grow up out of yeah well was there a period so this is one thing that I'm interested in we've got so much to talk about but was there a period where people enough people had Broadband that you could have like really fancy splashy websites before rise of like mobile phones and then you had to like think about okay people are going to be consuming this on a phone too was there like some specific period where people could just go Hog Wild and like build any kind of crazy website and was was there that kind of period of I don't have I don't have that sense of there being a specific time frame like that I do know I waited for a long time for cable modem you know like Fast cable based internet speed to come to my area and the area that I noticed the biggest like factor for that was gaming when I was playing Quake 2 so I played Quake 2 like for like 10 years the same game Quake 2 multiplayer and when I would shoot the rocket launcher on dialup I had to aim like in the virtual world like 10 feet ahead of the person yeah and because it would just take time it was a big lag uh but then when you got the cable mode and and your my my ping was like 215 back then that would be like a great that would be a great ping and then we got the cable modem and it was like 32 sometimes it was the biggest difference now of course that was a huge difference with the web as well um but for me I kind of don't really recall that time I I was slower on the uptake with mobile development like when the iPhone came out I I I kind of just waited it not not intentionally I just kind of never got involved with the early adopters of um mobile design uh cuz it was just so new and I didn't really you know I didn't really consider that very much yeah well um in terms of what you did with those skills as you were you're you're a teenager you're into building Doom Maps you're into building designs with uh some of these primordial tools Photoshop fireworks dream waver getting things live on the internet without even necessarily needing to know the HTML and CSS that of course like timately everybody has to learn you know when performance accessibility all these other things you don't necessarily want to hand that over to a tool right so right maybe you can talk about like where you went from there in terms of what the next few years of your life were like like right you went to you did you finish high school and where you went from there right so yeah once I hit High School um that's when you know the I I forget it was the counselor in the high school they they talk to every kid and they're like okay what are your plans you know do you want to go to college and my parents were old school and they just you know they didn't grow up with a rich family so they were old they didn't realize loans existed so they always told me and my my siblings I have a brother and sister who are older I you're not going to college you know that you're not going to be able to afford that we can't afford that you know so you know you're on your own you know go to like a technical school or something like that and I was like well you know what I I really like computers and I know I can make a living from this and back then like in high school early High School the way I made money is I would do these design contests that these Web Master forms would put on so design contests are a thing that uh actually still exists today this day um and they were I think probably more popular back in the day but like 99 designs.com is one of them um that's a modern example but yeah I would do design contest that people would have on forums um like design this logo winner gets $300 and you know so I would get $300 here and maybe design a landing page or something like that and get $800 here it's very sparse you know being in in high school and actually one time um to back up a little bit I think I was in seventh or eth grade and I got a job offer from a software company in Fort Knox um for because I was helping this guy with AOL API Visual Basic programming it never worked out because they were going to pay me a $30 an hour but they're human resources wouldn't allow it cuz I was just too young and so that you know that experience and then making a little bit of money online that's I was like I'm I'm going to finish high school but I'm not going to college because it's just I didn't know otherwise and I'm glad that actually happened in the long run um because I didn't have all those bills and it did work out in the end yeah and that's four years you got to spend in Industry that you would have SP right right and so parties or something I don't know do in college so then I I graduated and at that point I'm not making any type of consistent you know normal amount of money unfortunately my parents weren't the type like you're 18 you have to get out so I stayed I lived with them until I was 23 um and that whole time I had this girlfriend and we got engaged and so I when we got married I moved out like that same day it's like a a very traditional thing it just worked out that way but all the way up until that point like I was about 23 I wasn't making any consistent money I was very worried I was like I have to leave soon I'm not making good money I don't want to work for some somebody else because my father he had always been selfemployed and what did he do yeah so he he all he did and and he actually still just did it here recently after three Strokes by the way I he he serviced washers and dryers and also sell he sold used washers and dryers and so it doesn't sound glamorous at all but he was making like for a while when he was really established like you know $10,000 months which is a lot of money back then yeah and and so all the greed flation of 2022 like in the 80s $10,000 a month is like the equivalent of like $30,000 a month oh yeah yeah it's crazy yeah very very solid income so he and and he didn't it was rare that he hit that number mean usually I think it was like six or 7,000 a month but you know having seen that and also having this idea even if it was false that I can't go to college that it BW a fire under my butt but I realized it was hard to like figure out how am I going to make it in a free Lance context you know and um it it how I ended up actually making my first like my establishing a real career out of this was purely by accident you know I was um dig.com um I'm not sure if you're familiar with. y Reddit precursor yes and it's basically a social one of the first if not the first social book marking type site um I'm not sure if it was but it was real popular back then and if you made it to the if your article or your content made it to the front page of dig.com you were getting thousands of visitors to your website and so I remember thinking in my my wedding is six months away and I'm not making consistent money yet at all and like I wouldn't be able to afford our our rent for our apartment or whatever well I decided I like I'm going to rate a tutorial just to see if I can get hit front page dig.com and it was it was one of the worst tutorials ever how to design an awesome logo and it hit from page dig.com and I I got all these thousands like 13,000 visitors or something and I wasn't selling anything there was no monetization and you know I was like okay that's cool and then like five months later I just randomly check my website stats and I'm getting like a thousand visitors per day like where's this coming from and it was Google and so back then if you ranked very well on dig.com other websites were linked to you so it had a natural like SEO effect yeah where I I'm ranking like literally number one number two number three for like how to design a logo how to create a logo how to make a logo and so I thought to myself wait okay so I'm showing in this one really long like written tutorial how to make a logo most people realize they're not going to be able to so I sold I I made my own backend because I understood I PHP and and MySQL and stuff I made my own backend I and people could just click this Banner like hey I'll design your logo for you if you're not competent or something like that and the way I did it is I didn't want to talk to clients so I built a entire order system and there was an intake form for for the project um and I charged $75 for One logo design concept and that was it um and once I put that Banner on that that page I got basically one order per day I averaged so there I go and I just started a career by accident and of course over the next 5 to seven years I was doing primary primarily logo and identity designs essentially and I had to masked about 2,000 clients and I I I increased the the price up to like 300 um which you know I would have done things differently if I had the information I know now but I and then of course those people needed websites as well U some of them and so I would um offer a service where they could have a website design designed for them like like a Photoshop like a mockup for like $600 and and so that's how I started making money and fortunately right when I moved out I was making enough money and then I started making more and we could talk about you know what I did thereafter but that's how I kind of got started from okay being a teenager who's has some skills but not sure how to make money um into what was essentially an accident I and that lasted for five to seven years before the algorithm and those that that page eventually stopped you know receiving as much traffic yeah so I mean $300 a design you said you're getting like around one client per day 2,000 clients like that's a lot of work it is insane and you know what's interesting is I traditionally people think you know if you're a freelancer you have to you have to talk with the client you have to have meetings with the clients and stuff and if you're at a certain price point um and and I I know I think his name is Brett from design Joy he has this similar approach and I know there's a lot of controversy around you know him and his business or whatever but that certainly can work where you don't have to necessarily talk to the clients before they actually pay you uh so it it really comes down to having a really good landing page um that's effective on all fronts and uh you you can actually you know make a living by not having to deal with the client aspect as long as if you have really good intake form um and I did I was able to find tune Bine to get to get the information that I needed out of the client essentially so they would order fill out the form I it would tell them there's a weight period And I would design it and they would see it and then offer feedback like like if they're Happ like they could request a revision if they want for x amount and if they we would have a back and forth with like a little comment system and most clients were really cool most clients I was able to satisfy within one to two revisions and then of course you have your outliers that uh were nightmares to deal with after you know of course if you're dealing with that bulk of clients you're going to have terrible clients that you you deal with and at that point you just kind of refund them and just you know I'm sorry I can't but that was very few and far between so it worked very well yeah wow so uh that's that's really good Insight like in terms of kind of productizing your services right uh essentially getting it to where you've got a system in place that is not necessarily one size fit all but one size fits most so that yes there are people who are just incompatible with the way you want to get things done right and uh your time's too valuable to you know try to work with every client and make everything a success so you just give them the money back right and part ways and focus on the people that you can help and it doesn't sound like you had any shortage of people that wanted your help no no I I mean that website you know I I I I replicated that success with that article with a with one called how to design a website and so I actually ended up ranking for number one number two number three for those typee of keywords as well and so yeah I was making over well over 100,000 a year um for you know a good couple two or three years um and that was B basically from 2007 2006 to like 2012 2013 or so and so I was doing web design for clients all exclusive work I my only tutorial was that tutorial that I wrote you know and then my very first YouTube video was on 2010 and that was just for the fun of it um I didn't take YouTube seriously until about 2014 but we might be skipping ahead a little bit too much but yeah well let's step back and kind of like unpack some of the things that you just said so you're you didn't go to college uh you don't have to worry about paying back student debt uh you've lived very economically it sounds like staying with your parents until you got married you got married pretty young like I did I think I was like 20 five maybe when I got married okay so uh and so you've just got this kind of like and and also you didn't move to like a big expensive city like a lot of people do when they're young uh you just kind of stayed around well I I'll tell you why and and basically I think it was a year after we got married I my wife got pregnant and we realized you know we can't move from our family you know they're too much help yeah absolutely so like there was so much help and our firstborn was you know she was is still you know our our our trying child you know it requires all of our energy so I we had tremendous help here locally and like just you know better weather is it did not supersede having help from family and now we're just here you know we really love our our property so we don't feel like moving so awesome yeah well you're one of the first people I've interviewed on the show who like lives out in the open I think you said you have like seven acres which is uh for anyone outside of the US I'm not going to attempt to convert that into hectares but it's a lot it's a lot of space like I think this house this is a very standard uh you know Texas you know house uh I think it's it occupies maybe like a a quarter of an acre okay you know so the property that was our house before this in the city yeah yeah it was real small and um but you know I started to become more successful and like we just had to get a bigger place cuz we were in like a I think it was like a 12200 foot like house at that time then we moved here about three or four years ago and it's a lot better yeah yeah yeah actually this might be like an eighth of an acre it's it's pretty small uh we do have a backyard uh and one of the things I want to talk about real quick while we're talking about houses and backyards you were on the path of the eclipse uh that happened here in the United States this week as a recording uh today is April 10th when we're recording this uh just just two days ago there was a cosmic event that only happens at least in Dallas once every 300 years or so um yes it was cool yeah we we ran at a cabin uh it's about 25 minutes away from here to and my wife and my mom like they've been planning this for like 5 years since like we had a partial one in 2017 uh so theyve been gungho over it you know and I saw it and it was it was really cool it was cooler than I thought it would be um just to look up and like you see that perfect little ring there I it was very cool yeah the cricket started chirping in the middle of the day because it got dark it was really cool because we were up next to a lake it was it was so cool yeah we just watched it from our backyard and like all our LED yard lights came on yeah which is really funny cuz they're all like you know uh now we're planning we're planning on going um in 2044 to North or South Dakota because that's the next total eclipse I guess 204 20 20 years away yeah if you go to South Dakota or North Dakota that's why my wife said is that otherwise here 2099 so I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to live that long I'd be 116 yeah that'd be uh you can hold that I was like man I like the eclipse so much think I'm just going to chill in my backyard for the next 300 years and catch the next one right but yeah like it it was how did how did it make you feel no it was cool I had my family around me um and it was really cool you know I we had our glasses you know our little glasses and and I yeah it it was awesome I I did I didn't make a huge big deal about it as much as my you know I think it it it really inspired my wife and my family a little bit more than me but I knew it's just it's just the moon going in front of the sun it is cool though yeah and the fact that they can pinpoint the pr you know accuracy and know exactly where it's at as people in NASA yeah it's really impressive uh technical Fe being able to predict these things right uh given how complex you know orbits are and everything right right yeah but yeah well so you've got this I mean you're in a very you know enviable position having all this freelance business coming in you're not necessarily I mean you do Marketing in the form of publishing these tutorials that generate SEO uh essentially that generate inbound leads but yes you're not out there having to like pound the pavement and sell yourself sell clients on like hey uh I'm Gary Simon and I can do web design for you I can do what you need me to do you know like people are coming to you that's amazing right and so and I I really that was great that I had that win um but I knew in just just in the back of my mind but I didn't act on it and this is just being young and it was a it was a very difficult lesson to learn is that you can't get complacent especially with anything dealing with internet and Technology because it moves fast um and so I remember I was out there playing tennis this one day I was thinking to myself if man if you know if if I stop getting orders and and Google stops sending me traffic I'm going to be in a bad place you know because I have this $1,400 mortgage we just moved into this nice place my second daughter was just born and I sure enough you know Google made some changes to their algorithm and I only had those two pages like I didn't keep making content that was such a stupid idea and I just took it for granted that I would just rank forever and slow enough over about a sixmonth period you know my income went from like making you know like 10,000 a month down to like you know 4,000 3,000 and it was such a bad time and that was what was that that was about 11 years ago 11 12 years ago and um and so I took up you know I I started drinking a lot and like I we had to move out of our house cuz we couldn't afford it damn damn you had to like give up your house yes and so we moved to you to the city into a much smaller place more manageable uh house payment um my wife went back to work as a register nurse parttime I so that was a real big wakeup call for me that was like okay you knew this was going to happen like nothing lasts forever why were you just you know being complacent you know and that's the biggest that's a big takeaway that still applies today probably in any I aspect of a business any type of business um but especially if you're a freelancer if you're not doing enough to push yourself out there continually and and promote yourself and try to diversify the ways in which you're able to to make money I after a while you might have like a run for five years consider yourself lucky if if you're able to just kind of like maintain the status quo for five years um doing nothing essentially because that was me I was I was doing something by working with my clients but I the new leads weren't coming in because the traffic was dropping and so I I had to make some decisions at that point yeah well uh that's like a nice um terrible Parable uh as as I like to always tell my friends who are in SEO you know we always say live by the Google die by the Google right right yeah it's amazing when it's working and but when it's not it's like oh myy yeah absolutely uh and and certainly I I think you've learned a lot from that and you now got this very distributed kind of like multifaceted approach toward business um and you know I'd like to talk more autobiographically but maybe you could talk about what your your setup looks like today how you're bringing in clients uh before we get into the nittygritty of working with clients because there are going to be a lot of practical takeaways I just want to understand what you learned how you applied those learnings and what you know design course what Gary Simon uh Incorporated looks like today right so today I don't deal with clients um I guess you could call my coaching clients clients uh but that's entirely different um so you know after just to back up I won't spend much time on this yet but to back up after right right when my business was failing another opportunity presented itself and somebody emailed me asking if I would create a course for them uh because they saw a couple of the YouTube videos I did and I was just doing Photoshop tutorials and um I had only up to like a couple of them and and so I took that offer up and they paid me like $2,500 to make a course on like Photoshop or something and so I started making my money that way and so I pivoted from client work to teaching now and that happened very quick fortunately and I'm glad it did because I was able to not have to get a regular job so to speak I and I was just basically contracted on a month basis to create a course so I was making one course every month typically about 120 you know 90 to it was typically about 90 minutes long that they wanted and this was in vad network which are the people behind theme forest uh which is I think still popular but it used to be really popular familiar with their work we've oh I get their emails occasionally because I think I bought something on one of their websites a long time and so they own tou plus.com yeah and that's what I was teaching on and so I did about two years worth of work with that so anyhow not to we can go back to that but just to answer your question so I haven't really I of course sparingly maybe one time a year I'll have a client that I do actual work with I but it's sometimes that client could be me it could be a personal project um but that's one of those things you know being a creator for so long now I've been in you know being a creator for about 10 years uh and being on the teaching side of things is yes you have to continually learn a lot of new things to be be able to create new content but I'm at a point now it's like I want to start getting back into client work so that I could start changing for for one I could start getting real world experience again back with working with clients which I'm not afraid of because I know how to do it yeah um and I know the current skills you know obviously my skills 10 years ago wouldn't translate today but so I'm I'm always very current because I have to be with my YouTube channel I but I I I do want to get back into um creating you know some type of a hybrid of a a design subscription agency maybe where I only take on one client a month or so until I'm done with them and then as a part of their package they'll get featured their if they want it to be their project will get featured on my YouTube channel so it's kind of like a winwin if they want that marketing and publicity along with having me design their site and so I'm going to get if that's my plan is to get back into that sort of thing as a way to a get into client workk but also be I have new content and interesting content on the YouTube channel yeah so let's say I have like a barbecue sauce company and uh I'm like oh I can not only get my barbecue sauce website designed implemented uh potentially set up to be relatively maintainable but also I'm going to get free not free publ based in like people are going to be looking at my barbecue website as Gary explains how we built it right it's just like additional incidental publicity right right yeah yeah and I would think you know maybe it wouldn't be a barbecue uh sauce company maybe it would be you know somebody who has a business that could benefit from that type of audience that I have so something like devel design or development related perhaps because they would get their biggest bang for the buck in that that context so so like let's say some loow code tool for example or would be potentially like uh you know an AI API or something like that right right yeah so I'm excited to to start working on that sometime this year so very cool well anyway body who wants to potentially be a c of G's shoot him a message uh I'll I'll put his contact below uh but um I want to talk about freelance because freelance is how most people start their developer careers unless they just happen to go to a career affir after graduating from Stanford computer science degree like had this like nice carpet rolled out for them by like right a Fang company or something like that most people uh that are learning the code are going to get a friend or family member a local business somebody to give them money uh to develop something for them develop like some internal tool develop some sort of um you know website uh maybe even just build like uh you know a custom Shopify page or something like that right like so maybe you can talk a little bit about the skills that are important to a freelancer and I've got a bunch of questions I'm going to fire off at you first maybe you can talk about the importance of like sales and marketing skills okay as a freelancer yeah so I'm going to say um not a lot of people want to hear this probably but in my opinion at the very least understanding marketing um is just as important if not more important than understanding you know the actual skills that you need to deliver the product or the service in this case if it's it could be uiux design skills or frontend development or backend um or even internet marketing if you're doing that route but I knowing how to do internet marketing itself is just as important uh than those things as well in my opinion uh because I even even though I I satisfied like 97 98% of my clients I with the logo design business and stuff once Google stopped sending me all those you know all that traffic I I didn't know what to do really from there and and so I didn't really have good marketing skills even though I that's because I had I got lucky you know that that web page ranked very well and I got lucky with it uh so when that happened I was like oh my how do I get how do I get traffic you know and like I could design really well and you know I can do all these things but they're worth nothing if you don't have the traffic and you don't have you know the ability to sell your your services and so my my practical advice in today's you know current environment is there's many different ways to get clients um there's there's search engine optimization which is still around I don't think that's going anywhere of course you know the AI stuff has kind of thrown a wrench into that a little bit but I search engine optimization if you want to choose that and you want to stick with that um as being your goto source of like how I'm going to get clients you can completely do that and go down that rabbit hole and start learning SEO um or you can go the social media route and that's that's a route that I took for my business my education business of course I focused hardcore on YouTube um and so so you have to pick an Avenue and you have to stick with it if you try to spread yourself too thin by trying to do you know SEO on top of Instagram and Tik Tok and YouTube and x and all that stuff it's going to be probably a little bit more difficult um at the same time there's a middle ground because you don't want to just choose one like I did with Google I but the the the the the good part of the story is that it's just it's just a matter of okay you took the time to start learning your craft and your skills like if you're a UI designer that might be being really good at UI design and and you have a great eye for UI design Aesthetics well you need to take that same that same type of motivation apply it equally to okay I have to get clients now I and how am I going to do that that's through internet marketing through one of those channels yeah interesting so just to recap what you're saying take that same passion that you feel for the technology that you're using and channel it into getting clients and learning how to use marketing channels to your advantage right I can talk a little bit more specifically about how one can do that but yes yeah I mean a lot of people out there consider themselves like introverts and uh as a result they may feel very out of place going to like a you know a Toast Masters or like like a rot club or uh or going to like a just like a local American Chamber of Commerce type event or something that and trying to make friends and potentially get clients um right what would your advice be to those you have to yeah and so that that's like the same thing with my wife she's huge in introvert um and I want her to start creating an internet presence for her she's a lactation consultant now so she she helps moms breastfeed basically um and she's the only one in the tricon area and and I I told her I was like you can make a lot of money like if you were to sell like a book or something and become the influencer route and but she's like I hate being in front of the camera and I was like okay well I didn't like the idea either if you go back on my channel and you click on the videos Tab and you you sort it by the oldest first you'll see one of my first videos um where I actually presented myself on screen that was in 2014 and it's terrible you know you don't you don't feel right I about it you you feel out of place but that's an expected part of the process because it's something new that you've never done before so you look at yourself you might look at yourself and say this is so cringey but as long as you're delivering the the content and people will like it and you'll see that based on how the content you know uh how it's performing in terms of views likes comments dislikes and you know whatever platform has for for engagement factors um but the the the the short the the idea here is though is that you have to do it if you want to be successful now I'm not saying you have to get behind video camera but I'm saying whatever it is that you want to do if it requires you to do something that's out of your comfort zone you have to you have to just ignore that you have to ignore it because otherwise what's the what's the alternative the alternative is not doing it and you're going to fail no matter what um so you don't have to have the best equipment um I certainly didn't you know you slowly start to amass and increase your production value and and all that stuff if we're talking about video and uh content and St and stuff like that yeah that makes a lot of sense so just to again recap you're saying like at the end of the day you could be an amazing developer you could be amazing at understanding client requirements and everything but if any one of those different like legs of your stool is weak the stool's going to fall over right it's going to collapse over you and it sounds like being extroverted or putting yourself out there doing the uncomfortable thing is one of those things that you just have to you know right and some people will find that more natural than others CU we're all different and we're all you know you could be a type a person ity versus you know somebody who's a complete introvert you know and those people will have an easier time but you can still do it you can still get behind that camera and click record and start recording yourself uh there's nothing stopping you unless you don't have a camera of course so I and even if it's not even video related content it could be for instance if you're going to take the social media route well I say you know you need to amass a following essentially and how do you do that it's by typing out good content or if it's going to be you it could be written content it could be just pictures or infographics that are interesting maybe based on what you're learning as a uiux designer you're sharing your work grow your audience as much as possible and you do that by producing content um if you want to take that route there's a lot of routes to getting clients I and we can delve into that a little bit more but well let's talk about the clients themselves that you typically work with or that you work with when you're doing a lot more freelance work uh are are what kind of Institutions are your main clients are are they like small businesses generally or so yeah so back then when I was dealing with um those type of clients they were typically you know somebody who's just going to Google literally and typing how to design a logo or website and a lot of these are small business owners or people who are just launching a business I never got to the point where I was working with like really large businesses or or institutions because I was content with you know the amount of money I was making you know you back in like 2010 10,000 a month is still a lot of money um not so much now but I it and I and I was just content with it you know and I I did work a lot of my own like side projects I had several different Ventures and and I applied my you know my learnings that way but but in terms of the clients themselves minimal communication um mainly you know there's probably a good mix of like uh local brick and mortar businesses but also internet businesses as well because I was known pretty well in forums and stuff and um and that that was my a clientele and when you're charging less you know such a cheap amount you know you didn't I didn't really I wasn't really on the radar of like really large businesses um that's one of the reasons I want to kind of get back into it as well um I know that having the information that I know now and also my network and my audience that I could I could definitely you know charge a lot more um I and work on a little bit like a longer time frame per client uh compared to what I was doing before so uh one thing that jumped out of me that you've said in the past is that you don't like to charge an hourly rate but instead charge by the deliverable itself right how did you come on like like how did you come to this conclusion and has there ever been any push back from clients that are thinking in terms of like oh I just want you to work for n hours or something like that right right and I've always told them I was like you know it it really depends and I always felt not comfortable with take taking on a project they gave me all the information that I want and because if you're going to charge like a per project base and not hour hourly then you your intake form has to be very comprehensive it has to be it has to cover all the bases because you don't want to be a situation where they're like oh okay you you told me it would be $2,000 to make this site I and then they're they're like but I want this now and I'm like well you didn't include that so like if it's a very open like Whimsical thing where I the client may not know what needs to be done or whatever hourly would make sense but most of the time I when I dealt with clients they were able to provide me with all the information I need so that I would be comfortable enough with giving them a solid concrete price yeah and are there any red flags that you see when you're looking for a freelance client like is there like some pattern or some Persona that you're like oh no it's one of these kinds of potential clients yeah so like don't undervalue your services um don't sell yourself for too cheap uh because those type of clients typically end up being the most picky um so red flags in that context so so for me with being that most of my clients I never talked to them before they became my client I could tell you I could see red flags in their intake form in that that they hardly fill anything out and so I would sometimes respond to them like listen I need more information if I'm going to be able to accurately design an identity for you um so for everybody else though who might not take that R in in the traditional approach where clients will first contact them well it's very important to be able to read into um what they're saying and how they're saying things uh because you would see red flags potentially based on just their the words they choose the use and and the ideas that they're trying to to get across you could there there's red flags that would say I I'm not going to take on this project there's definitely those scenarios um and it it might be a situation where they seem too iffy and not certain on Project requirements uh as long as there are certain and they answer everything that you need then I think the red flags could be avoided um but if they're not able to provide you with all the necessary information you need and they seem wishywashy those might be the ones that you might want to avoid yeah and and that's just because they may not know what they want and if they don't know what they want they're you're not going to know what they want yeah it could be a situation like that as well and and it's really hard like sometimes like my mom like if she sends texts and we we text each other back and forth like she does she's just not familiar with internet vernacular and how you say things or whatever and like I for me I feel like I can read anything anybody types and get a really good sense of what they're thinking you know and what they're inferring all so having that skill is important I would say um to be able to determine like if they're going to be a good client it's the same thing with relationships some people are just terrible at picking a partner they there just like it they just lack this innate sense to really read a person well which is unfortunate I but I've always thought that I could read people well um and so I was always able to avoid the bad horrible client situation for the most part they existed and you're never going to be able to avoid them 100% I because yeah people will charge back on you um like they pay you through and that happens I mean especially after 2,000 clients people will charge back uh when you're dealing with a like a servicebased industry where you know it's a very aesthetic and a subjective idea like like what constitutes a good logo they might think it's one with like a lens flare and I'm saying that's terrible idea you know so you're going to have that um but you know as long as your skills are good and your communication skills are good and you can read people you shouldn't have much of a problem with that sort of thing and it's certainly not reason not to get into it to service based industry yeah well let's talk about pricing because I imagine you have like allart services like if you want this then it's this much this much but sometimes when you work with a client maybe you're doing something more bespoke and how do you know how much to ask for for a given project thought process yeah for me it's like that's a it's a difficult question because there's not an objectively correct answer for every business um I I suppose through testing you could find what that might be and when I say testing we're talking like AB split testing with with pricing and stuff like that to find like okay if I raise the price am I going to lose clients I is is my conversion ratio going to drop you know and that's that makes sense of course if you're doing the the type of pricing that I was doing where it's just it's upfront you know like when somebody visited that page they didn't have to contact me first to realize what the price and that's because I was doing kind of like real quick work in a way I was kind of like a McDonald's of loc Lo design because it was cheap it was really cheap and so I could get away with just you know but then again bread of design Joy I mean if he's charging four thou $5,000 per client you know it's not not necessarily that clients won't do it because it's more expensive but you have to have a really good onboarding process uh to to get people to to want to hand you the money first without talking to you first yeah um so for me like if I'm talking you your average you know like your listen anybody watching this right now you may not approach it that way because that's not your typical way to take on design clients usually they'll there'll be a contact form on your site and they'll give you'll get a little bit of details about the project but then it'll send you that email or notification of some sort and then you're going to contact them get more information and then you come to a price that's the typical way which I rarely ever did myself because I just didn't want to do a clients and client communication I wanted to to minimize that as much as possible and not to say that that's what you should do that's just how I personally wanted to handle things hands off as much as possible um and so but if you were if I were to do to take that route I the price that I chose is going to be based on my research of what other um Freelancers you know in my specific Niche are charging you know and you can really Niche down as a designer developer like if you're a uiux designer maybe maybe you may maybe you don't even have clients maybe you'll you'll sell framer templates or web flow templates or you use that to you know as a side hustle or something um but in terms of knowing what to charge I would I would get out there personally I would see okay anybody with a design subscription agency if I'm going to do something like that I'm going to I'm going to take notes of what they're charging based on the quality of the work based on what they're delivering you might even sign up uh or you might hit up another designer asking them like for you pretend just to be a client I've never done this but I think it's a good idea because you could kind of then you be able to see not to un to intentionally mislead somebody but what would their what's their first response look like after you contact them you know for you know maybe they'll give you pricing ideas but for me I would see what the market is dictating yeah and I would instead of selling myself short which is what I did initially with the logo design I would I would start higher than what I think I'm worth and more often times than not you you are worth what you think you're not worth if that makes sense are you ever afraid to like throw out a price that people are going to B at it and it's going to end the conversation well in a Moder in a context that fits my business currently um when I used to take on sponsorships on my YouTube channel that was one of those things where you have to throw out a price to these companies like indeed.com like they were one of my biggest I'm clients I and I worked with so many others like skillshare and and all them and they they hit you up in sort of the same way way like it's it's all economics you know supply and demand the their demand was they wanted um they wanted traffic targeted traffic to their their business or product um and in that that case I was just looking what other creators were doing we have a Discord server all all of us YouTube programmers and stuff we have a Discord server uh and it's private and we talk about what we charge and it's based on your views and all that stuff so the same thing can be said about um your web design business as well you have to be honest with your skills uh because obviously not all uiux designers and frontend developers are of the same caliber so you have to be honest with yourself um and and and take into consideration what others are charging and then also Implement that and experiment with split testing uh if you're you're getting traffic to your website you're trying to generate leads split test everything as much as possible um to to to find out what it is you need to do to you know know get more leads get more conversions um and then experiment with pricing that you tell people as well yeah so the website the actual stuff you can control uh by pe by the time people go to you know Gary Simon uh.com or or some comparable like uh portfolio site uh or some sort of uh I guess squeeze page is what we used to call them back in the day where your goal is to get people like down the funnel and clicking through to contacting or entering their credit card or something like correct uh before you can even get people there of course you need to get out there and the way that most people get out there these days is through like SEO or through um Google ad which is pretty expensive Facebook ads I mean that is a way you can do that if you have enough money they they used to say it takes money to make money but to some extent if you create content or if you if you're on social media or if you're good with SEO you can kind of like get free traffic yes uh but if you were starting over or maybe how would you advise somebody who's starting today and they've already got great skills let's take for granted that these people already have great skills we'll talk a little bit about how to get great skills later but let's assume that people do have great skills and it's just a question of getting clients what kind of projects or what kind of things do you think would attract clients to actually come to your website right right so um like I said earlier there's a lot of different ways to find clients and I think it's important for that individual to understand first all their options like what are the ways that you can get a client as a uiux designer and what are the ways you can get a client as a frontend developer you because there's are slightly different things there's a lot of overlap of course and once you understand the various methods um of which you could potentially gain clients and maybe even not even gain clients like if you're not even going to work with a client like I said you could sell templates for templates and web flow templates they make really good money doing that if you focused on it so once you understand what the options are then you can pair that with what you're comfortable with focusing on in terms of I like how I'm going to choose to to to build clients so when I have my coaching calls um with with people that are in that this exact scenario I've had several of them um I I have this little document and I and I tell them okay well I the modern way I would say for most like uiux designers front of developers I would focus on social media personally uh and building an audience that way I would share my work as much as possible I would follow a lot of the people who are already established and in the position that I want to be in and one little hack I have for that um you know if you go to awards.com awww ars.com there's a jury section and they have jurors there that kind of rate the best websites um and it links it list their their their their X profile and their LinkedIn profile if they have one and there are like hundreds of these people and I tell them just follow them develop a network see how these people carry themselves on social media see what it is that they're doing because these people they're they're working either with large companies uh or or design agencies or they're solo uh and they're charging like 20 $30,000 for projects or more and so they're they're they're at the Pinnacle some of these a lot of these people are and so you want to follow them and see how they they carry themselves um and then you can interact with them you can start to that's networking that's part of what it is another thing you can do like I said sharing your work is the obvious thing uh but also sharing if you're a beginner sharing tips that you learned as you go because suddenly you become the best person to teach that thing uh because being that that the Newbie problem you know was fresh in your mind um and you'll find that people will start to follow you naturally and and having a following um is a benefit icial Factor if you're trying to either get employed like in a traditional employer employee relationship but also freelance as well um I'm not saying you just want to have a ton of other designers following you uh but you'll find that if you start putting out your work consistently and you're engaged and you're you know the I am a UI designer this is what I put out today you know and mention your portfolio and stuff by by nature of having followers of perhaps other people who are in your shoes it starts to I it becomes a real really good factor in um you know other designers reaching out and collabing with you and perhaps they have another uh maybe they have a client that's not a good frit for them or you know there's so many different ways if you're able to build up your a following on social media so I think social media is like in my opinion one of the best ways to get started uh because it's something you can do while learning um and and and so I think that's a a great aspect or or a great method for yeah I trying to trying to just establish a presence online and and from that um you can you can definitely get to a point where you're you're getting a lot of client requests yeah I mean social media you hit it kind of on the head in my humble opinion uh social media is something you can do along the way it's right almost kind of free it doesn't take that much time to tweet about this project you just spent like 10 hours building it takes like two seconds to twe right um and it's you just kind of do it along the way and it's like it's almost like a a limb is kind of how I think of social media it's like a way of me expressing myself and sharing information it's like you an organ yeah and and then if you want to take it a step further and this is something I did for a while as well is you know I would you know every time I learn something you could write an article about it um so I had another site called cet.com and and I got that up to 10,000 visors a day and I was teaching angular back then I and so like I ranked very high for angular and well all I did was you know I kind of followed the Gary vanard Check route um and and and that's what got me started on YouTube actually um he's like make a piece of content every day it doesn't matter what it is and so he did that with his Wine Library TV he did like 3 years of every day doing a wine review and just went nuts on it and it was very successful because no matter what he made a video so I did that as well uh my first 100 videos were 100 videos in 100 days and I got burned out but that was huge um so if if somebody wanted to take that mentality you need to apply that mentality like if you're serious you need to apply that if it's going to be social media focusing on you need to do something it doesn't have to be every day but if you're going to determine it's two to three times a week I'm putting out content then you have to stick with that no matter what um you you have to be like for scump and that's the mindset that you have to get into whether you're trying to learn a new skill and that means learning something every day or promoting something every day uh that's where the consistency the consistency will pay off regardless of what Avenue you're choosing so for me I would write an article I every time I uploaded a video for a while and so there therefore that took care of the SEO um I started getting like longtail traffic keywords and and all that stuff and you don't have to be an SEO God to understand how to rank you just have to be absolute consistent um and pumping out content a lot um and and that's that's that's what you can do if you don't have like a big marketing budget like through paid ads all the paid ads can be very profitable but you typically have to lose a lot of money because it it requires optimization um if we're talking about paid ads like through like Facebook or Google there's like a discovery process like you have to iterate on your ads and Facebook go and you're paying money the whole way yeah and I don't that's why I personally don't advocate for for it um I'm not I mean I've done P paid ads for a while um like a long time ago so I don't know what the current I'm sure it's more competitive um so it's going to be more difficult and it requires it requires money up front and you may not you may lose to it's it's common for marketers to lose thousands of dollars early on in a campaign uh because you have to you have to really mod I make sure your ad copy is very good the the initial Banner that they click on like whether that's on Google or Facebook um and then you have to make sure your landing page is like on point uh and and so for me if you're starting out you don't have much money uh SEO organic SEO is a a really great way along with um social media awesome uh and I just want to Echo some of the sentiments uh you know free C Camp as a charity we we've never had the budget for like advertising and because free cocain is free there's not any Roi advertising so we've always kind of been uh you know limited to social media limited to uh Google SEO which for every video for every podcast I write like a short article summarizing that podcast publish that on our own website having your own website having that be optimized having that be accessible having that be fast uh you know but basically what you just said you already spent the time to create the video tutorial or the you know why not also share it on social media why not also have an article that kind of serves as a vehicle an SEO vehicle for that piece of content so yeah I just that come down to delegating too I mean it is it takes time to to write stuff um and I've always been bad at delegating it's the one thing like I have to improve is being willing to allow other people to take over parts that are kind of mundane you know uh and so I've been a bad business person in in that regard because you can only grow so much you know until you hit a ceiling which I have hit a couple years ago so I'm making changes you know in that regard but um being willing to have other people do it but yeah I mean if you're willing to hustle I mean and and you have to sometimes you you have to hustle at different times in your life you're never going to be a hustler 24/7 I don't care what anybody says it's not sustainable for me it's it's I I go through periods you know where I'm a little bit more relaxed you know I spent six months building this studio um and then my business like I wouldn't say I I neglected it but I wasn't on top you know and I so those are things that you have to to to look out for yeah and just to add to that uh I genuinely believe that just doing fewer things but doing them well is totally fine and there's there's this old saying I always heard as a kid if you want something done right do it yourself and like to some extent like I don't have any assistants or anybody that helps me with like Bo will help upload the uh the podcast to YouTube and he'll uh uh help you know add my base intro to it and make sure like do some very basic video production but Bo runs the entire you know pre YouTube channel but like like that is kind of delegated to him like some of that but uh in terms of things that I do every week my job is pretty simple in that like I've chosen to prioritize a few key things that I can do sustainably and definitely okay I think where a lot of people have problems and they burn out is they try to do too many things as opposed to doing a few things well yeah and that's one of the problems like you know they people might see me and like oh this guy's really good at UI ux design he can do front of development he can do Identity Design and all this stuff and I was like yeah well I've been doing this for like 25 years or like more you know and so of course I I I I can have these skills and be pretty good at all of them but if you're trying to start off trying to start off being like a full stack developer you're going to have a very hard time like you have to pick one thing and really focus on that um you know I have no problem if somebody wants to learn figma as a UI ux designer and then on the side they're trying to learn HTML and like a little bit of CSS so they can understand like that's okay in my opinion that's you know it's always Bor it could be really boring the opposite if you're only con you know if you're requiring yourself only to work within like one typ one tiny thing so there's other skills that you can work in but I wouldn't start trying to learn like I laravel PHP along with figma and like try to do both at the same time and try to get both of those type of clients at the same time that's very difficult I stick to one thing and then once you get pretty good with it and comfortable you know you can start to add other skills eventually and and and and also it's also I I don't want to say you can't do those things like for instance if you're trying to if you have a side project and I really believe in side projects you do have to wear a lot of hats for it to be successful if you're doing it alone so that means you're going to be doing the uiux design the Identity Design the front end development any backend stuff and the marketing and I think just going through that process uh as somebody to understand what it takes because you'll probably fail the first few times you do it it's good to have that as well under your belt because it will teach you a lesson like it's this stuff is not easy you know I if you have a great uiux design but I you know maybe your codee's terrible or more typically it's the opposite maybe you're a great coder but your UI this looks horrible well those are one of those things that you have to delegate out if your skills aren't up to par and to be able to design really good it takes years you know it's just like anything be able to play guitar it takes really well it takes years sometimes it's it's just one of those things you have to be consistent about and patient and as long as you understand those things up front you you can be successful yeah a lot of people burn out because they're like why am I not getting the results I've been lifting weights for six weeks why am I exactly yeah and it's the same like like like my course like I have a uiux design course is 16 hours and it's interactive it's all this stuff and and I you know it might take the average person a month or two but you're not going to be a great uiux designer after you take the chorus and that sounds like a bad thing for me to say as somebody who wants to promote my course and I want people to buy it but I'm being honest with you yeah you can you can have you can watch the course and follow along but then you have to start putting this stuff together in your own you know your own Rule and it's a lot different so it takes a lot of practice to build that muscle memory and what you said about what you said about projects like obviously if you're building a project and you're putting it out on like Reddit and like look at what I built and all that stuff you're going to have to have so many different disciplines you're going to have to get some degree of exposure to so many different aspects of building something publicizing something uh and and just coming up with something and designing it is a whole another series of skills but you you can have a little bit of exposure to a whole lot of Concepts it's just not that you're going to go out and build yourself as a full engineer just because you did like you put some of this stuff together for a single project like like you said it took you 20 plus years to build up the skills that you have to be able to actually like I mean logo design you were deep on logo design 2000 logo design clients right like spent a great deal of time learning the theory and the practice behind identity and probably all the color theory typography like all these different concepts that go into being a really strong logo designer and feeling confident in your work right right right yeah so like like I said earlier like I'm not always in this mode of where I have to continually get better um some times I'm more complacent than others sometimes I'm you know really trying to learn something new hardcore so I'm not saying it takes you 20 years to like be great at like uiux design and front end development um but it's not going to happen after watching a couple full stack development courses either I it's just like I said it's just one of those things and I think the best way to learn I'm going to go back to this a little bit is a side project idea if you have a side project um and you're excited about it like it's an it's an idea you think think can maybe work somehow I like I'll give you a quick example the guitar stuff like um if you've ever if anybody has ever looked at like try to learn music theory through I like learning scales and modes like you'll see on a like a Google Images you'll see um these notes mapped out on little fretboards right where it shows the six strings and stuff and they always look like pixelated and junky and so I made this IDE I was like What if I we made this app that has a an interactive guitar fretboard where it's interactive and they can quickly change so sorry I hit my microphone so I made we made fretastic decom fastic and yeah F re t s.com and it's just like an interactive guitar fretboard service oh so this is sweet and and so I was excited about it because I was like there's there's a couple other competitors but they're not doing it right and they're it looks ugly um and so once I decided that hey this idea can make money I got excited about it and so so I I even though I do have a partner who's a developer on it it it will help you learn all of these things a lot easier because then it's not a chore you're excited about the project that's the problem with a lot of like like most courses or almost all courses it's hard to get excited about something else that somebody put together like through these tutorial projects or something but if you have that excitement about some little idea some type of tiny little sass you know software as a service or something I that that's when a lot of the stuff will you you will by nature of being interested in it you will start to learn these things if you want to try to go this solopreneur route or try your hand at Indie hacking or something like that awesome yeah this is a really cool project by the way uh I'll link to it in the show notes again a quick reminder that we do have lots of links uh if you click in the YouTube if you're watching this on YouTube YouTube video description or if you're listening to the audio version in the uh like in Spotify or in apple podcast whereever listening to this so frit tastic very cool um one thing that I want to talk about before we get into building skills because I'm very excited to talk about that is just are are there any channels for publicizing your work as a designer as a developer that you think are underutilized or or like more people should know about these because obviously everybody knows about like Twitter and Facebook and uh LinkedIn and and they may have even heard of like design places like dribble for example but what are some channels if you will that you can get your work out there and potentially find an audience that people may not be thinking about right so I just recently had this one idea I haven't executed on it yet but I'm fairly certain it would work pretty well is I've had this idea it's like okay this would be great idea for somebody who wants to get into freelance like say let's just say it could be friend and development or uiux we'll just say like as a uiux designer or uh or something like that um or maybe somebody who is even like like an indie hacker almost I mean I I noticed my wife's lactation consultant business she's a part of a Facebook group of with other lactation consultants and um they they're always complaining about the software they have two software options that people have made um for tracking your clients and all that stuff and I I guarantee you if you go to any type of Facebook group on based on any type of Interest or you know career or whatever you're going to find I you you're going to see real user feedback on the existing software or solutions that exist in there um you could promote yourself as somebody like say for instance I maybe you're really into Fitness training and you go to the gym a lot and you're also a uiux designer you can completely craft a business that's geared just to that towards that industry uh and and you could promote yourself potentially you know on something like that um and get your name out there I think that would be a great way because you know what I think one thing that's over utilized is something like dribble probably and he's like I'm a designer you know I'm going to put my my project on dribble and you get two or three views out of it and you're just lost in a sea of other people uh so for me like if we're you're thinking if you're trying to think outside of the box um developing a niche is a great way U especially you know in this day and age you know it's it's it's comp competitive as it's ever going to be probably um and it's only going to continue that way as the internet is more you know popular and such so if you can Niche down a little bit in that regard I think that would be a great play um just to to find so something that you maybe you have expertise in like a secondary skill like Fitness or guitar uh you could you could you could make band Pages for perhaps you really good at designing band Pages uh and and promote yourself in in the necessary uh markets where those people are frequented or frequenting frequenting sorry and there are lots of lawyers doctors uh people who who run small businesses probably uh people that uh you know repair uh washing machines and things like that my brother took that on right right yeah that that also are interested in bands or are interested in video games or any of these other Hobbies so a lot of times you can incidentally find people that are uh potential clients uh just within those area so right like for example like when I was uh a developer i' i' I'd go running through like San Francisco a lot and uh so I would go to like running meetups and incidentally meet people who were interested in client work who were just going for run just some lawyer or something right so like don't don't uh I guess weed out those kinds of activities those even though those may be fun for you they may also be networking opportunities oh yeah exactly you're right you could to totally just pick one industry like I said and like just go hard on that like try to land some like influencer clients perhaps uh offered you to work for free yeah just if they'll use your design like that's something that you put on proof and like I that's something I could talk about as well as I this idea that you can't do work for free yeah let's talk about that obviously an open source Community like a lot of the work done within Freo Camp's Community is done by open source contributors without any expectation of compensation right right right and so yeah there's this idea that um especially like for uh UI designers and stuff like you can't don't ever work for free and I agree with that but what they're talking about is they're talking about monetarily speaking don't work for free because if you're not making actual cash then it's not worth it but I and and there's positives and negatives what I'm about to say but I for me like I did work for free for a while um and and and doing contests is kind of like working for free if you don't win because it's very unlikely but um I I would actively back when I was doing search engine optimization long time ago like 2006 or something I like I would literally do design work for other website owners if they would link back to me so like I would get back links I know it's it's a little like gry hat SEO but um what I'm talking about into context like if you're a brand new designer uh and you don't have client work well you don't have a portfolio then right that's why some designers they'll have a portfolio and they'll put their portfolio as as one of their projects like don't do that uh you need actual work and to be able to Showcase and have a portfolio so a lot of people are wondering how do I get client work if I I have no portfolio and so one of one of my like I tell my coaching clients is like there's there's a lot of ways to find clients you just have to you might have to work for really cheap or free and the value in working for free monetarily speaking because you still gained something otherwise you wouldn't do it is in having the ability to have a a project on your portfolio with a case study and that right there is the value that you'll gain by doing something for free um and that is tremendous because one of the main things that the first thing I think that most clients or and employers will look at when they hit your folio is not going to be your portfolio itself it's going to be looking at your client work so if you if you did something for somebody um or even a side hustle a side project that works as well um and you're you're not paying yourself obviously uh you're giving yourself the the ability to have client work you know making sure they used it you know you don't want to put something in there that they didn't end up using it needs to be on a live website uh so that you can have that trust Factor for you so working for free in that context I have zero problem with I and some people say you shouldn't do that it's like well how do you get a client you know you so for for me I have no problem with with people working for free in that context because they didn't work for free they G they gained something out of it and that's the opportunity to have a portfolio which then leads to money yeah and like a Counterpoint that like a lot of people might say well I'm like struggling to pay my rent like why should I pay you know work for free there is some degree of privilege or just having like laid a financial Foundation to where this is why I tell people don't quit your day job to learn to code or learn you know design or really learn anything always make sure you you have that taken care of even if it reduces the amount of time you have in your day that you can dedicate to Improvement uh it's much better to gradually learn to code over yes three years than it is to find yourself in Dire Straits because you you bid off more than you could chew and I forget you know a lot of times people have regular jobs cuz I never did and then when I when I was learning I was like in middle school and you know like I didn't have I had like 10 years where I didn't have to worry about money so it's easy for me to sit here and say work for free but like you said if you're in a situation where you have a mortgage and you have bills to worry about uh yeah don't quit your job find that one hour night maybe where you typically just sat and watch Netflix and just apply it slowly slowly but surely you're going to learn you're you'll start to develop your skills I so don't quit your day job only quit your day job after your side hustle now makes you enough money consistently you know yeah uh to to quit your actual day job yeah and it should go without saying but don't do the like screw you qu you know keep those res keep those uh because you never know you might need to go back and there's no harm in going back uh there's no harm in not making it as a freelance developer this time and having to get your old day job back and then keep keep getting more app backs and that's why like your service our free code Camp is just absolutely amazing it's it's probably the single Source on the internet that's hope that's helped that many amount of people who perhaps you know they they do have a job already already and F funds are tight like your your your courses are just insanely you know you have courses that are like hours upon hours long that are free so there's no excuse for anybody yeah to say that well I I don't have the money to learn this you know or I don't have the the time again I know some people are very busy uh and it could be very difficult just to get an hour of time but most people if they're honest with themselves they're not that busy so it's just a matter of wanting it bad enough and if you don't want it bad enough don't do it but uh don't make excuses though by you're sitting around watching Netflix all day playing games so I've always been a gamer as well up until like past like five six years like I I I worked in gaming as well so it's not like I'm one of those people you have to hustle 247 no way yeah yeah and same same here I I enjoy uh games and I enjoy relaxing with my kids and doing lots of stuff that's not work that is not productive it took me a while to get to a position where I had the time and bandwidth to be able to do that but I'm I'm proud to say that like I'm not on 247 cuz it's not sustain no it's not healthy either right I I want to thank you for your kind words about free C Camp we're very proud to have created these free learning resources for everyone regardless of their situation in life their economic situation as long as they have uh any sort of internet connection even if it's a really crappy internet connection free cocan Core Curriculum is extremely data light and that's by okay design so that people that are out in in the area where we don't have Broadband 20% of Americans don't have Broadband yet W in 20124 right and that that says nothing about the people living in rural Asia rural Africa uh you know Ral Latin America like don't take that for granted and we don't take that for granted we want to make sure but I I do want to point out that we've got some excellent Gary Simon uh stuff on Freo Camp's YouTube channel including uh this excellent video where you go through and you essentially like critique designs we published that way back in 2020 but I'm going to link to that in the show notes be sure to check those out learn more from Gary see him in action um so some of the things I want to talk about in terms of getting skills uh what skills should people learn in 2024 what are like the tools that you would recommend if you want to get into web design or you know frontend development like hybrid kind of ux UI design right yeah so you have a lot of options fortunately um it depends on what route you want to take so if we're talking about a website designer or the monit term like a uiux designer what skills do you need and what software do you need so I would say in terms of skills you have to understand the fundamentals of of UI design first and that includes and depending on who you're asking they might say there's five there's six or seven you know that's things like understanding contrast to these are in no particular order um topography understanding uh color psychology a little bit um understanding what color contrast is understanding what alignment means in UI design understand what visual hierarchy like all these fundamentals understand the basics first before you start try to getting into the fancy stuff yeah um in in in terms of the software well I the most popular UI ux design prototyping software is figma um but you can also go the um opr Source route with penot they just released um penot penot 2.0 that's pen p and that's an that is basically a direct figma competitor and they work very similarly so if you don't have you don't want to have to spend money on figma which you can get a free figma account uh it's just like they have paid plans and stuff like that if you don't want to do that you can go the pen pot route so if you're interested in designing websites and apps like the actual user interfaces that those are the tools that I would recommend um learning for that aspect alone I you don't get a website that works in your browser with figma or penot but that's the first thing that you typically want to work with because you want to get an idea of what your design looks like first before you start coding and I know that's some people prefer not to do that but my my my position on that is is if you you want to use something like figma or pen pot uh because it allows you to very quickly move things around and iterate and get and iterate over it and get quick ideas without having to type code first to try to design while and if you're doing a really basic cookie cutter landing page and you kind of have a a quick idea of what you want that's fine but if you want to be a serious UI uxer then you learn either figma or pen poot or any of the other competitor software out there yeah um and and then if you want to take if we're talking about maybe front end development then you have you have two choices today you can learn HTML CSS from scratch in JavaScript if you want some interactivity um and I I really recommend people taking the time to understand at least the basics or you can go the low to no code route with a tool like framer web flow Wix Studio I there's a couple other ones there's like dora. a I believe um and that's a that's an approach where you can design your website and you can also get it up there on you know on devices and browsers without touching code and the the ones like that I mentioned like framer and web flow they're so Advanced now um in in in the capabilities like allowing you to to create scroll based interactions and animations that it's a really good tool for people who just don't want to code but they love designing uh so that's an option as well yeah and uh so that's really cool that you're essentially presenting two paths you can start with the design and just use powerful power tools essentially like uh you mentioned framer Dora Wix web flow or right you can actually learn the fundamental skills that are like basically that are going to be the output of these power tools they're going to Output like CSS files and HTML files and JS but uh if you want to focus on design first it makes sense to go with the power tools where you can rapidly iterate and you can use that before you get into the nittygritty right right and and and of course learning the HTML CSS JavaScript and then tacking on to that you know learning maybe react or view or something like that uh you could take that you could take that route and it's going to ultimately give you more flexibility in the end to do things from scratch and some like larger client higher paying uh projects that have specific requirements where that's only possible that that's where it's going to benefit you um the most but if if you just want to frame yourself as a web flow designer which many people do you can have a career out of that alone I would be a little bit worried tying yourself to one piece of software because they can die out and you know I but it that's why as long as you have those UI design skills they're going to transfer easily from app to app because when it comes to being able to design a greatl looking user interface for an app or a website it's less about the tools it's more about your your eye and your you know and it's like a 90 10 a 90% 10% 10% tool knowledge 90% everything else that takes a lot more longer to to yeah like the actual taste you develop the of atics right um and and the creative reps that you get to be able to just come up with something that looks novel like like an artist sits in front of a blank canvas and just starts you know adding detail and they've got this Vision in their mind right most people if they haven't never done that before they don't even know what what do I paint you know where I begin it's interesting because this is I I call it I I don't know if this is a real term I call it the Observer Creator problem you know we're we're all great critics you know because we've for instance like well I'll put it in the context of I like guitar um because I play guitar I you can hear and Rec anybody can recognize a great guitar solo you know if if if a person gets one note wrong it just stands out so bad you know so we're great observers because we've listened to and we we've been subjected to music for so long but the moment you ask somebody to pick up a guitar and and do a solo even if I give gave them six months to try to learn the Eruption solo by Van but guitar solo ever include at least one bum note in it by the way he which is that I I can't remember but he he said he made a mistake when he recorded it but this was the old days they just like cool whatever we got to get this album cut time money you know like those Van Halen albums so we're talking about Van Halen one the very first Van Halen uh album and uh Eddie Van Halen of course legendary guitar player uh just created this amazing solo that uses like finger tapping which was novel at the time I don't think it was a widespread or wellknown practice and uh it's just this incredible solo um but uh those albums they would record them live like they would go in the studio everybody would be playing maybe the drums would have some plexiglass or something around them but like people just played it and they practiced so much that they could just cut an album quality version of that performance and immortalize it on the album at least for the first two or three albums they did that so so um but but he said he did actually make like a very minor mistake but it was good enough so they just shipped it yeah there's some parts in that so that are so fast it's like it's open to interpretation but um but yeah so going back to my point though it's like they're going to have they're not going to be able to do it in six months and then you asked them to to create a soul of similar caliber you're not going to be able to do it either um and and that that that exists because observing is very much different because logically speaking wait I can recognize that this website looks great now if I try to create my own why does it look way worse like why doesn't this transfer and it's because doing is very different there are different neurop Pathways um when it comes to observing because you say wow that website looks great and then you try to it's like a 10 out of 10 and then you do it it's like a three out of 10 as a beginner and that's expected though a lot of people get tripped up like this I I just suck at this I I quit you know because I look at what I I could produce and they don't give themselves enough time because they don't understand upfront beforehand that you have to practice a lot and you have to bake this stuff into muscle memory and one and one of the greatest ways and this is a great parallel with guitar players and web designers is one of the ways that I advocate to get good with guitar and design is to Simply copy others so in in Guitar World we call it covers so I learned the eruption Van Halen you know solo I and that's called a cover and I learned it because well a I I think it it sounds great and I want to be able to do that myself I but B it's also going to help transfers that style into my brain so that I can interpret it and work into my own new ideas and that's what art is it's imitation right so the same concept applies to um design so like if you see a design that looks great well try to try to reverse engineer it and create it not as a something to put in your portfolio of course but literally cop it copy it pixel by pixel as a as a practice routine and I've done videos on this this concept and you'll find that uh physically you know working in figma or pen pot and recreating a design that's maybe on your other monitor or something and you're trying to you know piece it together exactly how they did it that actually it bakes itself into your I your your own future work um and then so that you can eventually develop your your own little style and when it comes to uiux design there's a lot of patterns so you can't really be too crazy uh but you can still develop your own style and your own your own things that are unique even though you're copying initially and and as just a means for practice and learning yeah let's talk about some of the design Trends you did this great video a while back like like you do this pretty pretty frequently like you you'll review different designs you'll just have just open up your browser and you got like a bunch of tabs open and you'll talk about it like and and some of the the e curs scrolling Mouse it's triggering some sort of Parallax effect or uncovering something or there's some sort of Animation that progresses as you scroll like like I'm curious about what you think like the big exciting Trends in design are um and uh what people who are designing should look out for right yeah so right now I would say in 2024 like the current trends that I'm seeing is like well load and no code is like getting bigger in my opinion um now of course that doesn't have anything to say with actual athetics um I in terms of like web design Trends you know I try to Ju Just for the purpose of keeping up to date and fresh on YouTube I'll I'll do these a couple times a year like maybe once a year like 2024 design Trends or whatever but typically when it comes to uiux design and design Trends in general you don't see big changes in a yeartoyear basis you might have one tiny little thing that picks up like glass morphism you know where people are making some of their UI cards look glassy or whatever uh but in terms of the big macro Trends usually it's like a s to 10 year period that we see things change like largely and the what we're seeing now in my opinion is there's a there's a big emphasis on um interaction and motion design and I think those things are great when you implement them where it makes sense um you don't want that stuff on an ecommerce website for your client uh or if it's a Content heavy website you don't want to have all that but if we're talking about landing pages and portfolios which was my personal thing that I like the most like SAS landing pages and stuff and and creating those type of things then interaction and animations I are play a good role and there's a definitely a skill and being able to apply those with accessibility of mine and also speed and use your experience in mind there is a middle ground to you know some say uh just don't do anything and if you're not good at motion design then yeah just keep it static uh you have to spend time to learn these things because it's a skill um just like making the website itself look good that's a skill like with all those fundamentals uh motion design that's definitely a skill as well both in terms of how you apply it with your animation timing and eases and all that stuff but also technically how you implement it um with things like green sock animation platform or you can do some of those in a limited context within framer and let the load of no code tools so going back to that I so animation interactivity is a big thing I think topography I'm experimenting with topography and also in getting out of flat design now because back we we had Web 2.0 which I think was 29 to 2009 is to like 2014 like that seems to be the window of Two web 2 2 out I think I I'm sure some people might disagree a little bit but yeah um that's when you know everybody was using gradients and drop shadows and strokes and glows and everything was just like you know there was very little flat you know it was kind of like skew morphism essentially and so then we had material design from Google came out and that was like oh this is all flat like they're just using solid colors everywhere and that that was a great I think we needed that the pendulum swung the other way into complete flat design for a while which is great for ux but then creativity I be believe began to suffer a little bit every website almost look the same so now I think we're seeing a push back against that to where we're seeing things like more colorful websites thick um I strokes and we're doing things that we T typically didn't do before and that's just a natural progression of of design Trends um I don't think anything major is going to happen until we get something like you know um the the VR stuff and the AR stuff to take off I kind of like how we did with um the first iPhone that was a fundamental change it required a big change in how we approach design um and so until we get to that point I'm not sure if there's going to be something else outside of that but until we get to that point we'll just see small incremental changes in terms of how we approach uiux until the technology really changes and shifts awesome so in other words if I can kind of very succinctly put what what you just said mhm don't worry too much about it focus on the fundamentals and the ground's not shifting like it might seem like it's shifting yeah but right yeah right the so like learning color theory learning typography learning these like where where would people learn some of these you cover this in in some of your courses y so I have I every year I do a free uiux design C crash course and front end develop there're two separate things I and I teach that I always make it a point to teach that a little bit in the crash courses so you completely learn that stuff for free obviously there's so many other sources um outside of me uh but my uiux design course which is a paid course that covers that there's an entire like mini course dedicated to the fundamentals in that course um and I have parody pricing and all that stuff so it's pricing meaning that if somebody is from like a lowincome country y then they can it'll knock like it'll knock off like 40% but yeah yeah that's cool awesome well we can we can put a link to that below as well anybody wants to try out that course um and uh what do you think about some of the AI tools you had this great video that I watched uh where you were looking at some of framer's AI tools and I think maybe they use the term AI a little liberally when it it sounds but what is AI really we've had AI since you know early chess engines and things like that but obviously like generative AI tools coming up with quote unquote creative stuff from Whole cloth and things like that uh what do you think about those AI tools are there any that have really impressed you right yeah so of course the the the one that's really impressed me impressed everybody like when mid Journey came out um just for generating images and the main use case that I see that being used and I it's integrated into my workflow I because I I will use mid journey to create assets whereas otherwise in the past I might have used something like unsplash.com which is like a free image you know resource that these are actual photographs that humans took um and what's really cool is like the prompt that you issue within Discord to interact with mid Journey um and it just keeps getting better and better I'm able to quickly generate an asset like an abstract like website background like some type of weird gradient or something and so youed have really fun experimenting with it and you can get some really good results with it um realistic or otherwise uh if you want them in any style um so that mid journey I use that a lot I also um would Advocate using Adobe illustrators a relatively new um vectorbased I AI prompt generation platform it it's really cool because before we couldn't get vectorbased um AI assets but now you can do that of course you could do that if you if you did the uh um what do you call the bit map to Vector process but usually artifacts yeah you get artifacts it' be tough to do um just just for the benefit of the audience when we say Vector we're talking about like an SVG file or something where it's like geometry as opposed to you know pixels right yeah so like if you a good way to describe the difference between like a raster graphic or like a bitmap graphic and a vector graph is if you like you zoom up on a photograph that you take on your phone like you'll see pixelation blurriness it doesn't look like good quality that's rastered um Vector doesn't have that but Vector of course you don't use Vector for like high resolution photographs you use it for like illustration and stuff and on websites you have icons you have little illustrations sometimes and Adobe illustrators um Vector generate AI generation tool is pretty solid depending on what you're trying to get it to generate so let's say hypothetically I wanted to have like a quill uh like I've got I want to have some old timey you know uh Renaissance Era um kind of broke music website a different musical period but like let's say that I I want to have like uh you know leave a note in the guest book or something like that I have a quill like I could go to Adobe and essentially prompt it like hey I need a a vector graphic of a quill and it should be tilted n degrees and it should be you know um it should have ink dripping from it or something like that I would use that yeah and I yeah and it would come all like four variations and sometimes it's bad and and sometimes it's it's really good and they allow you specify different styles so I would I would I would use that um not as much as I use mid Journey um because there's like in icons there's already so many icons that are very welld designed and you can't really get.com icons is like a website I've used I don't know if you have something better than that that you'd recommend yeah I I can't I'm not off the top of my head these days um but so those are two like graphic based tools uh I would use AI for um but I would also use chat GPT and L Ms for in general um and that could be as simple as like trying to get website copy you know that's the obvious one so you're not using laurum ipsum everywhere um but but also to come up with with ideas like perhaps even you don't want to rely on re on on these large language models too much like for like research you know the the research as aspect of like ux design uh but it's it's certainly a tool that's available um for you to to help assist you when you're trying to build a website or something even if it's a technical question or not uh so as a frontend developer you can ask chat GPT questions but just understand that it does get things wrong you know at times but if you have basic questions it's it's a great resource in my my I use it every day I I used to learn a little bit of music theory and I I can you can ask it questions or as long as they're General basic questions you're not asking it to make like a Facebook clone you you're good to go t typically all so that's the main ways write down that I personally use AI I in in my uiux workflow awesome well uh We've covered so much ground here I I do have a question that I want to ask you uh you've often said that that uh you you live fearlessly what does that mean and and why is it that uh you've chosen to live fearlessly well I'm going to be honest with you I'm not sure when I said that specifically but I'll give you a really good uh I'll give you an answer that makes sense to me because it actually it kind of aligns with you know like a recent I guess you could say transformation of my thought process and how I approach stuff in general I you know I for me I guess I I I finally understood that you know I I was a hypochondriac and so I was always worried about like Health ailments and which was really stupid because I was an alcoholic you know it's like how why are you drinking alcohol every night when you're worried about your health or whatever and and then F finally slowly I I shed that uh because I started going down this Rabbit Hole I know this is completely off topic but of of neardeath experiences and and I chose to believe these people that are having these neardeath experiences that's like one of the greatest thing that's ever happened to them like 95% of them say it's like the greatest thing ever you know what I I I decided to stop worrying about my health because hey I'm pretty healthy now you know I don't drink anymore and I I I run and lift a lot I but even even like as recently as two years ago like I was just worried about you know like if I had one small thing wrong with me healthwise it's because I have cancer or I have this or that and I finally stopped that and I don't have hypochondria anymore and because I believe you know when I die it's going to be I it's going to be a continuation of my Consciousness and so what I'm finding now is that I am living life in less fear in general just by having that Mantra in my mind like I'm not just going to die and rot there in the ground and that's it I that gives me Comfort and so I understand atheists might be like you know because I was an atheist and I'm still kind of am but I'm more spiritual now so I don't subscribe to his particular religion uh but for me like I said I I I live life fearlessly now in that context I of where I'm not I'm not stressing over everything because I I I I think this is just I for me just to to to better myself why on this time in the planet and so that that's what I that I that my new mantra is that so I hopefully that was a sufficient answer awes different than what you're talk expecting I mean congratulations on stopping drinking uh I'm very outspoken about the fact that I haven't had a drink since my daughter was born you know eight plus years ago and I have no intention of ever drinking again I just I I love just being in the moment present unadulterated and uh you know overcoming hypochondria like that can be absolutely paralyzing congratulations to you for figuring out a way to like push past that and be able to live your life man right yeah it it's been such an amazing experience learning from you both about like freelancing design uh and of course just your ridiculous work ethic and how you've been so uh productive over the past 20 years uh again I encourage everybody to learn from this guy I I've learned a lot from him I enjoy just uh be sure to watch his video of him playing guitar just great uh great video great video production and I'm very excited when I make it out there I'm going to hang out at your studio oh yeah sure if you have like a a fender P base or something like that like I'll just grab the base and let's jam cuz uh yeah let me let me t let me tilt the camera real quick yeah let's check it out let's check it out all right so uh I'm just going to verbally describe what we're seeing we're looking at a wall anybody listen something popped up on my screen is like something about the internet connection okay no it seems fine uh and uh whoa dude I mean you've got like those Fearless flyer style guitar stands that like just hold your guitar in position so you don't have to use a strap you've got like a fullblown movie theater looking thing and you got this that's a big uh screen back there yeah I mean it is how how tall is the ceiling in there it's probably at least like 15 ft it is 16 feet 16 feet yeah it's just giant Studio it's amazing uh beautiful wallpaper yeah I might be like tilted yeah so uh Gary it's been such an amazing experience we even get a preview of the studio which you'll see a lot more of if you subscribe to Gary's website to his YouTube definitely do that I'll have a link to that and uh yeah man it's been a pleasure to talk with you for the past two hours get such a huge injection of insight from you man you as well yeah this has been one of the kind of like a bucket list thing to have an interview with Quincy Larson which is awesome uh so yeah enjoyed it very much though awesome man well everybody who's listening hope you have a fantastic week until next week happy coding
