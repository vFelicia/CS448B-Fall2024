With timestamps:

00:04 - hey everybody is Jessie my streams a
00:10 - little bit there's something on my
00:12 - stream YouTube's telling me that it's
00:14 - bad so let me know if the streams not
00:19 - working I could try to restart it I
00:21 - think what happened is I just had way
00:24 - too many browser tabs open and my
00:28 - computer started to to lag a little bit
00:31 - and slow down at that point it started
00:34 - to tell me the stream was bad so I was
00:36 - frantically trying to close tabs before
00:39 - two o'clock hit so hopefully it'll start
00:44 - working again pull everybody everybody's
00:49 - saying hi in the live chat so if you've
00:53 - been watching the last couple of days
00:55 - seems like every day I get a question
00:58 - from somebody in the live chat about
01:01 - react what are we going to do react and
01:03 - I've been saying we're going to do react
01:04 - and we're finally doing it so as you can
01:07 - see if you saw yesterday my my Trello
01:11 - board here where I keep the track of
01:13 - everything the done column has a lot
01:15 - more things in it yesterday I put in an
01:18 - epic day of work thirteen and a half
01:22 - hours of work most of that time was
01:25 - actually spent on this site I did have
01:27 - some meetings and things like that so I
01:30 - didn't code the entire time but I got
01:33 - the site to a point where everything is
01:37 - pretty much in place aside from some
01:40 - minor minor details there's still some
01:42 - demo content that I just don't have yet
01:45 - there's some images that need to be
01:47 - resized but for the most part everything
01:52 - everything is pretty much how it's going
01:54 - to be when we go alive I'm sure they'll
01:56 - be some last-minute changes there always
01:58 - are Internet is paid for today so close
02:04 - for you okay sorry I had some people
02:10 - saying they couldn't hear anything some
02:12 - people saying the Internet's very
02:13 - for other people were saying it's okay
02:16 - so all right just just let me know if it
02:21 - sounds if it's really messed up you know
02:23 - put it in a live chat the the control
02:27 - room on YouTube is still telling me that
02:29 - my stream status is bad but my computer
02:33 - seems to be running okay again this
02:40 - happened one time before when i refresh
02:41 - the page I stopped the stream and
02:43 - started it it said it was good again I
02:45 - don't want to try to do that right in
02:46 - the middle of the stream now normally I
02:49 - would figure this out before I started
02:51 - the stream but it this actually have in
02:53 - one minute before the stream was
02:55 - supposed to start so as long as it seems
02:59 - like mostly you're having an okay time
03:02 - with this dream it's it's working so I'm
03:05 - just going to leave it alone for now um
03:07 - but anyway yes so the site's pretty much
03:09 - where it where it needs to be I'll give
03:11 - you just real quick I'll just go over
03:14 - some of the stuff that I did you can
03:15 - check it out all the links are in the
03:17 - description uh I added a couple links
03:21 - for for react and for next yeah that's
03:24 - what we're going to go over today so the
03:27 - home page pretty much the same as it was
03:28 - I added this here at the bottom these
03:31 - are little tabs these tabs this kind of
03:35 - style of tab that comes built in with
03:37 - materialized it's the framework we're
03:39 - using these cards are going to be
03:41 - clickable links and it'll switch back
03:45 - and forth between these two categories
03:49 - we have the the footer is now populated
03:52 - with the things it needs to be populated
03:54 - with I added this in the top this was a
03:57 - mandatory for me to add in we tried to
04:02 - add add this into a lot of our websites
04:05 - to have you know at least something
04:07 - uniform branding wise on all the sites
04:12 - you see the other page I'm not going to
04:17 - go into all the pages I'm afraid if I
04:18 - start going into it I'll spend half the
04:20 - time just going over the site when you
04:22 - guys can check this out on get up right
04:23 - now
04:26 - so let's jump into react so today I'm
04:32 - going to be working on the command line
04:33 - a lot which I haven't done previously so
04:37 - this is item 2 is what I use for the
04:40 - command line I'm on a Mac so I just all
04:45 - I did there was just open up a new tab
04:47 - so we'll start fresh on this side of the
04:50 - screen let me know if any of this is too
04:53 - small I can make it bigger I'm just
04:55 - going to increase the font size a bit on
04:57 - everything okay so we're starting out
05:04 - blank slate command line I've had a lot
05:06 - of people request to start out from just
05:10 - totally from scratch so some of the
05:13 - things that I already did do so it's not
05:15 - completely from scratch so let's say you
05:16 - just got your Mac or I mean these could
05:20 - probably same steps would probably work
05:22 - on Linux as well it's slightly different
05:25 - for a PC but not too different so you
05:27 - should be able to follow along for the
05:28 - most part let's say you got it fresh
05:31 - which you would need to do is install
05:34 - obviously I installed item 2 but you
05:38 - could just use the regular terminal that
05:39 - comes with mag and you'll want to
05:42 - install node.js so you just go to the
05:46 - node.js website there's instructions for
05:48 - downloading that so you have node and
05:52 - then you'll need NPM I think NPM comes
05:56 - prepackaged with node but it's been so
05:58 - long since I installed it on maybe it's
06:01 - a separate install but if you have those
06:03 - two things that's pretty much all you
06:06 - need to get to the point where I'm at
06:08 - today
06:09 - so not exactly from scratch but pretty
06:11 - close so right now I'm at the command
06:13 - line I'm going to go in I keep
06:16 - everything in projects so I'm gonna go
06:19 - to my projects folder and I'm going to
06:21 - make a new directory and let's call this
06:25 - CI for catechetical Institute that's the
06:28 - name of the site and we'll call this
06:29 - react
06:32 - okay so let's CD into that that
06:36 - directory
06:37 - okay so now we're in in the director
06:40 - we need at this point we're pretty much
06:46 - ready to go into the directions for next
06:49 - jazz okay so if you're not familiar with
06:51 - next basically it does a lot of things
06:55 - but the reason I'm using it is for his
06:58 - two main reasons one it handles your
07:02 - server side server side rendering that's
07:08 - important for search engines to be able
07:10 - to see your content the second reason is
07:13 - it just lets you jump start react
07:16 - development it loads a lot of things for
07:19 - you so that you don't have to do it one
07:20 - by one there are a lot of other things
07:23 - that do something similar react actually
07:26 - has things create rack react app that
07:29 - does the same thing and you can see more
07:33 - about react here's Facebook github dot
07:37 - and the links in the description so you
07:40 - can learn more about react from the
07:45 - website and I'll probably do some videos
07:47 - some pre-recorded videos on it when I
07:48 - get a chance but we're starting with
07:52 - next this is just its github page so
07:57 - let's let's set this up I'm going to use
08:00 - instead of NPM I'm actually going to use
08:03 - yarn it basically does the same thing as
08:05 - NPM it's just a little bit faster and it
08:09 - has this lock file that that has some
08:14 - other benefits I personally have never
08:16 - had any issues with different different
08:20 - repos and NPM like the conflicts between
08:23 - packaged versions but yarn takes care of
08:25 - all that for you so you will have to
08:29 - install so yarn I link to that in the
08:34 - description as well alright so I'm just
08:41 - going to go yarn so I wonder for NPM it
08:47 - would be NPM what is it in it let's see
08:51 - if I just go yarn if it'll do it
08:53 - nothing to install sorry I can't
08:59 - remember would be okay so we're doing a
09:03 - yarn in it basically this will create
09:07 - the package.json file that we see here
09:10 - so we need to add this script to
09:12 - package.json I guess I could have they
09:18 - could have just installed this but let's
09:21 - see CI react that's a good name when you
09:24 - do this it'll just ask you a couple
09:25 - questions you can actually just skip
09:27 - most of this and I will for the for this
09:29 - video I'm just going to skip most of
09:31 - this but you can fill it out if you want
09:35 - you can always fill it out later too
09:39 - okay everybody follow somebody mentioned
09:42 - UJS I haven't used view jazz yet I keep
09:46 - seeing it a lot come up in articles and
09:49 - things I'd like to learn more about it
09:51 - at some point okay so we have let me do
09:58 - this okay so now we have this package
10:00 - JSON file I'm just going to
10:10 - let's go yarn add so with NPM you go NPM
10:14 - install with yarn is different you say
10:15 - yarn add and I'm going to add next react
10:20 - and react on so now a yarn is doing its
10:34 - thing I've no idea how long this will
10:36 - take it's been a couple months since
10:38 - I've gone through this process also it's
10:42 - been a few months since I installed next
10:44 - and it's exchange just it's a couple
10:47 - versions ahead so this is unscripted and
10:51 - live so if we run into any issues sorry
10:55 - but that's kind of the point of the
10:57 - videos just to show you what I do even
10:59 - if I mess up alright so you see how fast
11:02 - that was that was actually faster and I
11:04 - thought it would be and all this stuff
11:06 - got installed
11:07 - which is pretty awesome because I would
11:09 - I don't know how long that would take me
11:13 - to install this one by one so everything
11:17 - is installed we can see we have a few
11:19 - more things here we have our node
11:21 - modules our package JSON and we have our
11:25 - lock file we'll never directly edit the
11:27 - lock file and probably never even look
11:29 - at it
11:30 - occasionally we'll need to edit our
11:31 - package JSON and we'll never directly
11:34 - interact with node modules but for now
11:38 - let's open our package JSON file so I'm
11:42 - going to I'm actually going to go Adam
11:44 - dot and that's my my code editor and if
11:50 - I do that it will open up my code editor
11:52 - in this case I'll topping out another
11:56 - screen I'm gonna have to pull it over in
11:58 - a second alright so let's pull this over
12:04 - and we'll just make that fullscreen for
12:06 - now so here's our package JSON file you
12:12 - can see it tells us we have this is some
12:16 - of the stuff that we skipped over and
12:18 - didn't fill and it just gave us default
12:19 - things but then here's our dependencies
12:21 - this section will tell us everything
12:24 - we've installed all our packages so we
12:27 - have next we have react we act on them
12:29 - here and this tells us our versions okay
12:32 - so we're good the next step we'll go so
12:37 - I let me organize this a little better
12:40 - for us okay never mind
12:47 - I see where it went it went behind so
12:52 - I'm going to minimize that there we go
12:53 - okay so we need to add this section and
12:58 - these are going to give us some commands
13:00 - we can use straight from the terminal to
13:04 - start our react app to build it to get
13:09 - it ready for production and then to
13:12 - start it as a production app so let's
13:15 - put that in
13:18 - - put it down below here and actually I
13:29 - don't think I need these tags do I there
13:34 - yeah that's why I was discovered yeah so
13:37 - I copied in some stuff I didn't need
13:39 - okay but these scripts basically what
13:41 - I'm going to be able to do is just type
13:43 - in yarn dev and it'll automatically run
13:46 - whatever I have on this side of the
13:49 - colon same way with your unbuild
13:51 - yarn started you can chain together
13:53 - things maybe later on we'll get into
13:55 - some more complicated things with this
13:58 - so let's save that and let's see that is
14:07 - that's it I mean that's all you need to
14:10 - get it to get it running okay basically
14:13 - well we need an index page so we'll just
14:16 - use their default index page for now
14:17 - just to show that it works to make sure
14:19 - that it works but we need to make a
14:21 - pages folder so right now we have
14:26 - nothing
14:27 - let's make direct three pages and let's
14:46 - okay so I've just made that file let's
14:49 - go back over to our editor and see we
14:53 - now have pages let me increase the size
14:58 - here okay we have pages on size my size
15:05 - of the code is increasing but I'm not
15:07 - getting this to increase I'm not sure
15:08 - why off to try to figure that out after
15:11 - the video
15:12 - I wonder if yeah I'm not getting an
15:14 - increase so if you can't see this
15:15 - basically I have a folder called pages
15:19 - and now I have an index file index j/s
15:22 - let's let's make sure this is what we
15:25 - needed okay that should be all we need
15:31 - for now we're going to save that I'll
15:35 - explain a little bit more what's going
15:36 - on in a second let's just get it get it
15:39 - started okay so now we're gonna do yarn
15:43 - where's my command line so I just type
15:53 - yarn run dev and that that runs that
16:00 - will run this command here next okay so
16:05 - basically what happens here is it's just
16:07 - started a server okay it's using webpack
16:11 - and it's just started the server and it
16:14 - says it's ready on localhost 3000 so we
16:21 - should be able to see something here
16:22 - I'll bring this up hopefully I don't
16:27 - have anything else running on that port
16:28 - right now her don't mess it up I've had
16:31 - that happen before all right this one
16:33 - this work let me bring this over really
16:36 - small I'll make it bigger okay welcome
16:39 - to next jazz okay so it doesn't seem
16:43 - that impressive we just have one line of
16:45 - text on a page but this is I guess
16:48 - technically a react up the minimum react
16:52 - up and you can see I have a browser
16:55 - extension to show
16:56 - we're running I guess the u.s. not work
17:01 - here we go
17:02 - so it shows we're running react and
17:04 - webpack so this is this is react hey
17:08 - guys sorry I'm annoying the live chat a
17:10 - little bit I just wanted to to get
17:12 - through that without messing up the
17:13 - install so I'm going to scroll through
17:17 - real quick to see if I missed anything
17:19 - important in the live chat it's like
17:21 - hello from Poland Montreal Brazil
17:23 - through Peru Sao Paulo
17:26 - Guatemala LA Italy well awesome : gone
17:33 - to bed
17:34 - somebody's from Narnia that's great I
17:39 - love that Ukraine Russia Kansas Pakistan
17:45 - Netherlands wow we got people from all
17:48 - over the place awesome okay so I'm going
17:52 - to explain a little bit about how reacts
17:55 - specifically next j/s with react works
17:58 - and if I'm losing anybody if you need me
18:02 - to go over something more let me know in
18:06 - the in the live chat there's a bit of a
18:09 - delay so I may not see it right away
18:13 - but I'll try to get to it and if I miss
18:15 - with something that you ask in the live
18:17 - chat put it in the comments I always go
18:19 - back and read those comments and I'll
18:22 - respond as soon as I can ok so basically
18:25 - when you're using next let me move this
18:28 - out here and let's let's check out the
18:30 - structure so when you're using next
18:36 - anything you put in this pages folder
18:39 - will be a route that will actually be a
18:43 - page in your app and you are in your
18:46 - website and we next takes care of all
18:51 - the routing for that so it's definitely
18:56 - can only appreciate if you're done
18:58 - without an extra create like that
18:59 - anytime soon okay so I got distracted by
19:03 - the live chat again someone had a good
19:07 - comment in here so you can only
19:09 - appreciate it if you
19:10 - it without next or trait wrecked react
19:12 - app it can be really time-consuming so
19:15 - yes that is definitely true when I first
19:19 - was trying to learn react and I'll say
19:21 - right up front I am nowhere near an
19:23 - expert at react I'm still in a learning
19:25 - process but when I was really really a
19:29 - newb it react I attempted it several
19:32 - times to do it from scratch with no help
19:34 - and pretty much failed I don't even
19:38 - remember what the result was so it was
19:40 - it wasn't memorable at all but I tried
19:45 - create react app and that was awesome
19:47 - and then I found next and basically I
19:51 - went with next because of the
19:53 - server-side rendering became you know
19:56 - out of the box because I needed that for
19:58 - a project I was doing a few months ago
20:00 - so most awaited video yeah I know
20:05 - everybody wanted the reacts though so
20:08 - anyway yeah I mean at some point if you
20:10 - have the time go ahead and try to do
20:11 - react just straight from scratch there's
20:14 - value in knowing how to do that and how
20:16 - to set things up exactly like you need
20:18 - to but the reality is you just don't
20:21 - always have time I don't know about you
20:23 - but a lot of the projects that I work on
20:25 - just there's just really tight deadlines
20:28 - and I don't have time to do it exactly
20:31 - the way I would want to if I have you
20:34 - know all the time in the world so this
20:37 - is a great time-saver let's go in and
20:39 - let's let's make let's make some other
20:42 - pages and I'm going to duplicate this
20:45 - tab so this is kind of cool about item
20:48 - two I'm sure other terminal applications
20:51 - do this but since I'm running the server
20:53 - now I can't type any commands without
20:56 - stopping this so I just open up a new
20:58 - tab and then I can still check on how
21:00 - the server is going and I have this new
21:02 - tab here so I'm just going to I'm going
21:07 - to CD into this pages directory since
21:10 - we're going to do some stuff in here and
21:12 - let's just make some of the pages that I
21:15 - know we're going to need and you notice
21:18 - these aren't dot HTML all these are dot
21:21 - j/s so you're not going to have any
21:23 - you got HTML pages and your react app
21:27 - about what did we need a team and I'm
21:35 - going to bring up on my other screen all
21:37 - the all the menu links that we'll need I
21:41 - don't need to add them all right now but
21:43 - it would be good to get some some
21:45 - examples okay so we have team we need
21:51 - courses advanced resources okay that's
22:01 - good for now okay so now if you can see
22:04 - all these have been created and I'm
22:07 - going to go in and let's see I should be
22:13 - able to let's just pop this same code in
22:18 - there and we'll just change one word to
22:20 - let us know that it's actually working
22:23 - before we get into action you bring it
22:26 - over content the next couple videos are
22:28 - going to actually be converting that
22:29 - static site that we built the last week
22:31 - converting that into react components I
22:33 - don't think we're gonna have time to get
22:35 - into that now we only have about seven
22:36 - minutes left
22:39 - okay so sorry arranging some stuff on my
22:50 - other screens here let's switch back
22:55 - here and we'll just fill this in I guess
23:00 - we do this one first just to make sure
23:01 - it works and I'll just write about
23:15 - okay so I'll bring this over so check
23:21 - that out I've typed in it might be hard
23:23 - to see here at the top but I've just
23:25 - it's just localhost 3000 slash about and
23:27 - that's our page that's what we built so
23:30 - all that routing is totally taken care
23:33 - of so I don't know if you've ever tried
23:34 - to build a routing from scratch either
23:37 - server side or client side it's
23:40 - time-consuming and it can be buggy if
23:44 - you're doing it so I I definitely
23:48 - recommend going with this I once did a
23:50 - project where I made a custom router
23:52 - completely myself and then I totally
23:55 - redid it and went with something
23:57 - pre-made even after I built everything
23:59 - because I realized that this is going to
24:01 - be so hard to maintain I'm I should go
24:04 - with some pre-made thing that more
24:07 - people are going to know how to use
24:08 - except for just me hey guys get a couple
24:12 - people saying hi alright so what we're
24:16 - going to do is let's try to bring in
24:21 - some we have time let's try to bring in
24:25 - some code alright I showed you the pages
24:30 - let me do show you where the components
24:35 - can live now with next the only folder
24:37 - that you absolutely need to have named
24:40 - something specific is the pages folder
24:43 - so you have to have pages and that's
24:46 - where the default routing is going to
24:48 - take place in you can name your other
24:51 - folders whatever you want I'm just going
24:53 - to name a folder just kind of the
24:55 - default components folder so I'm going
25:01 - to make that folder now and this will
25:10 - this will be where I keep most of my
25:13 - components if you had a really complex
25:15 - site or app you probably would want to
25:17 - break it down into different folders for
25:19 - right now I think this should work we're
25:22 - not going to need a ton of different
25:24 - components so
25:26 - and the components folder let's just
25:31 - make some of the components we know
25:34 - we're going to need so we're going to
25:36 - need a header let's let's call it a home
25:39 - header and let's call the convention
25:42 - home header so I guess it's been about a
25:51 - month or two since I've actually worked
25:53 - with react probably like a month and a
25:55 - half at least at this point the
25:56 - convention I believe if I remember
25:58 - correctly is that your components are
26:00 - all that they're capitalized so that's
26:04 - why I'm capitalizing this so we have the
26:07 - home header remember we had two
26:09 - different versions of the header and
26:10 - then let's have I'm just going to say
26:14 - header for the next one actually let's
26:20 - call it nav I've been calling it nav
26:22 - throughout this whole video series so
26:24 - let's not change it up now and now this
26:26 - just call this regular jeaious we have a
26:30 - that stinky nav is called a sticking up
26:34 - we have that sticky nav we're definitely
26:37 - going to need a footer and so we have
26:41 - all these components let me think
26:43 - we have cards for the team members and
26:49 - that'll be good for now we're going to
26:51 - have more components than that but now
26:53 - we can see we have our components I had
26:58 - learned weapons okay we had another good
27:04 - comment someone said they had to learn
27:06 - web pack to set up react tab they did
27:09 - learn web pack in the process though
27:11 - which was good but they said it was
27:12 - painful I'm definitely with you there
27:15 - for me coming from using it from first
27:19 - using grunt and then moving to gulp
27:22 - and then trying to transition a web pack
27:24 - it was a tough transition for me that's
27:28 - that's why this you know next Jas or
27:34 - something like it like create react
27:35 - react add it takes that off of you so
27:39 - you don't have to learn web pack just to
27:42 - use react if you want to just build
27:45 - something cool and react just to learn
27:47 - it or to start out with then you can
27:49 - just skip that I recommend learning it
27:52 - at some point though but it doesn't hold
27:56 - you back from me being able to do
27:59 - something with react
28:04 - okay so let's bring up let's bring this
28:07 - up so we have our components now and
28:11 - we'll bring up the footer and let me
28:14 - grab I'm going to try to grab some
28:17 - boilerplate here for a component
28:22 - hopefully they have one probably
28:30 - skipping over something this will
28:39 - probably work this is a little bit more
28:40 - than we need but I think this should
28:42 - give us what we want okay so with a few
28:46 - minutes okay I have one minute left I'll
28:48 - just pop this over that's extent
28:53 - actually that's not exactly what we want
28:57 - [Music]
28:59 - yes that happens but like I said this is
29:03 - unscripted it's not rehearsed beforehand
29:05 - so I may not be able to get a component
29:09 - built today although I did get a little
29:13 - farther than I thought I was pretty sure
29:15 - that I would mess something up when I
29:16 - was installing everything since it's
29:18 - been so long but I'm not seeing it I'm
29:24 - just going to have to go back to one of
29:25 - my previous react projects and copy
29:28 - something from there it's a good whip it
29:32 - someone says there's a good web pack
29:34 - tutorial that helped them out a lot if
29:37 - you could go ahead and and link to that
29:40 - that might be helpful for everybody if
29:43 - they don't they're not familiar with web
29:45 - pack yet need some extra help let me go
29:48 - the last thing I'll do in this video I'm
29:49 - going to go real quick to one of my
29:50 - other repos
29:53 - and I'm going to just grab some code
29:57 - from a footer component that I did for
29:59 - that repo for that project and I'll pull
30:04 - it in and I use next for that as well
30:12 - let's find this footer
30:25 - okay all right so I got it let me copy
30:30 - this in its going to be a lot at first
30:32 - but let me show you the basics so um
30:35 - importing react component from react in
30:40 - this case I'm importing this let me take
30:42 - this out because I don't have this
30:43 - component now edit mother flip project
30:47 - I'm calling this footer and so and then
30:53 - at the bottom here I'm exporting footer
30:56 - that's the basics that you really need
30:58 - and let me just let me take this out
31:02 - over low so plug-in error because I
31:05 - don't have that component
31:06 - let me just real quick double check to
31:09 - make sure that okay I don't think I'm
31:11 - using any other components but this I do
31:16 - want to keep this in basically all I'm
31:18 - doing here is just making sure that that
31:20 - copyright date at the bottom is always
31:23 - current and I guess I don't I don't need
31:27 - this right now this is my Google
31:34 - Analytics tag so obviously I'm going to
31:37 - use a different one and I don't need
31:38 - that right now
31:38 - so let's say that and let me try to
31:42 - bring in into one of our pages so let's
31:46 - try about let me import see if this will
31:51 - work let me see how I do this and I'm
32:00 - going a couple minutes over I apologize
32:02 - for that but since we kind of started
32:06 - this I'd like to just finish up and get
32:10 - one component linked up here alright so
32:19 - yeah I'm just trying to copy and paste
32:22 - some stuff so I don't mess it up and so
32:24 - I can go a little bit faster okay so I'm
32:26 - going to import footer from footer and
32:32 - let's
32:34 - let's actually bring this let's see if
32:42 - this work I'm not sure that this will
32:44 - work but let's try it out all right it
32:59 - worked great let me bring this in
33:03 - everything worked out for me today I
33:05 - didn't mess anything up so it's a good
33:06 - day yesterday I was a little off I
33:08 - messed some stuff up I didn't do my
33:10 - usual pre stream routine yesterday so I
33:14 - don't know if you tuned in yesterday I I
33:15 - don't know if you caught it but I just
33:17 - felt kind of really off but anyway that
33:21 - footer component that we made this is
33:24 - for another one of my my sites that I
33:26 - did so it's not the same info but you
33:28 - can see it brought in everything now
33:30 - what it didn't bring in where any of the
33:31 - styles because we didn't bring that in
33:33 - so try to adjust quality video the
33:36 - screen so blurry by someone saying the
33:39 - screen is blurry credit risk quality
33:42 - yeah on my end it does look like the
33:44 - stream is good at least YouTube's
33:46 - telling me stream is good it should be a
33:48 - 1080p if it's blurry for you is possible
33:51 - that it's a it's your connection I'm
33:55 - pretty new to live-streaming so I might
33:57 - be mistaken but alright so that's that's
34:01 - pretty cool so within basically a half
34:03 - an hour
34:04 - we went from pretty much nothing to
34:07 - installing everything we needed for a
34:10 - server-side rendered react app we
34:14 - created about what like five pages in
34:16 - that app and one component we linked
34:20 - that component up to one of the pages so
34:23 - we did all that now granted I copy and
34:25 - pasted a lot of stuff but you can see
34:27 - how how easily it is to get started with
34:31 - react it looks good okay sorry
34:37 - distracted by the live chat again okay
34:41 - it looks like the video is looking good
34:42 - to some people okay 728 no problem yeah
34:45 - as long as you can get 720
34:47 - it should be readable anything below
34:49 - that I would think it would be too fuzzy
34:50 - to read the code and I'm sorry for that
34:53 - if you're not able to read it right now
34:55 - it'll be available in about five minutes
34:57 - to watch the the replay maybe you can
35:00 - get it to come through better for you
35:03 - on the recorded version and so thanks
35:08 - for tuning in everybody I will be back
35:12 - tomorrow at the same time next week I'm
35:16 - going to have some some different times
35:18 - I know I have some a meeting on Monday
35:21 - at 2:00 so I'll have to reschedule that
35:23 - and then I'm going to go to a conference
35:24 - at the end of the week so we'll see
35:27 - maybe I'll do some video from the
35:29 - conference I'll be a syntactic on in
35:31 - Charleston South Carolina
35:33 - so we'll see I guess let me know if
35:36 - anybody's interested in seeing video
35:38 - from that conference maybe I can try to
35:40 - stream something from my phone or we'll
35:43 - see how good the Wi-Fi is but I will be
35:51 - back tomorrow let me know if you have
35:53 - any suggestions for me or if you need me
35:56 - to go over something in more depth and
35:59 - tomorrow we're going to really get into
36:01 - making a lot of components and making
36:04 - some pages so it should be fun all right
36:07 - you're welcome see you guys

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody is Jessie my streams a little bit there's something on my stream YouTube's telling me that it's bad so let me know if the streams not working I could try to restart it I think what happened is I just had way too many browser tabs open and my computer started to to lag a little bit and slow down at that point it started to tell me the stream was bad so I was frantically trying to close tabs before two o'clock hit so hopefully it'll start working again pull everybody everybody's saying hi in the live chat so if you've been watching the last couple of days seems like every day I get a question from somebody in the live chat about react what are we going to do react and I've been saying we're going to do react and we're finally doing it so as you can see if you saw yesterday my my Trello board here where I keep the track of everything the done column has a lot more things in it yesterday I put in an epic day of work thirteen and a half hours of work most of that time was actually spent on this site I did have some meetings and things like that so I didn't code the entire time but I got the site to a point where everything is pretty much in place aside from some minor minor details there's still some demo content that I just don't have yet there's some images that need to be resized but for the most part everything everything is pretty much how it's going to be when we go alive I'm sure they'll be some lastminute changes there always are Internet is paid for today so close for you okay sorry I had some people saying they couldn't hear anything some people saying the Internet's very for other people were saying it's okay so all right just just let me know if it sounds if it's really messed up you know put it in a live chat the the control room on YouTube is still telling me that my stream status is bad but my computer seems to be running okay again this happened one time before when i refresh the page I stopped the stream and started it it said it was good again I don't want to try to do that right in the middle of the stream now normally I would figure this out before I started the stream but it this actually have in one minute before the stream was supposed to start so as long as it seems like mostly you're having an okay time with this dream it's it's working so I'm just going to leave it alone for now um but anyway yes so the site's pretty much where it where it needs to be I'll give you just real quick I'll just go over some of the stuff that I did you can check it out all the links are in the description uh I added a couple links for for react and for next yeah that's what we're going to go over today so the home page pretty much the same as it was I added this here at the bottom these are little tabs these tabs this kind of style of tab that comes built in with materialized it's the framework we're using these cards are going to be clickable links and it'll switch back and forth between these two categories we have the the footer is now populated with the things it needs to be populated with I added this in the top this was a mandatory for me to add in we tried to add add this into a lot of our websites to have you know at least something uniform branding wise on all the sites you see the other page I'm not going to go into all the pages I'm afraid if I start going into it I'll spend half the time just going over the site when you guys can check this out on get up right now so let's jump into react so today I'm going to be working on the command line a lot which I haven't done previously so this is item 2 is what I use for the command line I'm on a Mac so I just all I did there was just open up a new tab so we'll start fresh on this side of the screen let me know if any of this is too small I can make it bigger I'm just going to increase the font size a bit on everything okay so we're starting out blank slate command line I've had a lot of people request to start out from just totally from scratch so some of the things that I already did do so it's not completely from scratch so let's say you just got your Mac or I mean these could probably same steps would probably work on Linux as well it's slightly different for a PC but not too different so you should be able to follow along for the most part let's say you got it fresh which you would need to do is install obviously I installed item 2 but you could just use the regular terminal that comes with mag and you'll want to install node.js so you just go to the node.js website there's instructions for downloading that so you have node and then you'll need NPM I think NPM comes prepackaged with node but it's been so long since I installed it on maybe it's a separate install but if you have those two things that's pretty much all you need to get to the point where I'm at today so not exactly from scratch but pretty close so right now I'm at the command line I'm going to go in I keep everything in projects so I'm gonna go to my projects folder and I'm going to make a new directory and let's call this CI for catechetical Institute that's the name of the site and we'll call this react okay so let's CD into that that directory okay so now we're in in the director we need at this point we're pretty much ready to go into the directions for next jazz okay so if you're not familiar with next basically it does a lot of things but the reason I'm using it is for his two main reasons one it handles your server side server side rendering that's important for search engines to be able to see your content the second reason is it just lets you jump start react development it loads a lot of things for you so that you don't have to do it one by one there are a lot of other things that do something similar react actually has things create rack react app that does the same thing and you can see more about react here's Facebook github dot and the links in the description so you can learn more about react from the website and I'll probably do some videos some prerecorded videos on it when I get a chance but we're starting with next this is just its github page so let's let's set this up I'm going to use instead of NPM I'm actually going to use yarn it basically does the same thing as NPM it's just a little bit faster and it has this lock file that that has some other benefits I personally have never had any issues with different different repos and NPM like the conflicts between packaged versions but yarn takes care of all that for you so you will have to install so yarn I link to that in the description as well alright so I'm just going to go yarn so I wonder for NPM it would be NPM what is it in it let's see if I just go yarn if it'll do it nothing to install sorry I can't remember would be okay so we're doing a yarn in it basically this will create the package.json file that we see here so we need to add this script to package.json I guess I could have they could have just installed this but let's see CI react that's a good name when you do this it'll just ask you a couple questions you can actually just skip most of this and I will for the for this video I'm just going to skip most of this but you can fill it out if you want you can always fill it out later too okay everybody follow somebody mentioned UJS I haven't used view jazz yet I keep seeing it a lot come up in articles and things I'd like to learn more about it at some point okay so we have let me do this okay so now we have this package JSON file I'm just going to let's go yarn add so with NPM you go NPM install with yarn is different you say yarn add and I'm going to add next react and react on so now a yarn is doing its thing I've no idea how long this will take it's been a couple months since I've gone through this process also it's been a few months since I installed next and it's exchange just it's a couple versions ahead so this is unscripted and live so if we run into any issues sorry but that's kind of the point of the videos just to show you what I do even if I mess up alright so you see how fast that was that was actually faster and I thought it would be and all this stuff got installed which is pretty awesome because I would I don't know how long that would take me to install this one by one so everything is installed we can see we have a few more things here we have our node modules our package JSON and we have our lock file we'll never directly edit the lock file and probably never even look at it occasionally we'll need to edit our package JSON and we'll never directly interact with node modules but for now let's open our package JSON file so I'm going to I'm actually going to go Adam dot and that's my my code editor and if I do that it will open up my code editor in this case I'll topping out another screen I'm gonna have to pull it over in a second alright so let's pull this over and we'll just make that fullscreen for now so here's our package JSON file you can see it tells us we have this is some of the stuff that we skipped over and didn't fill and it just gave us default things but then here's our dependencies this section will tell us everything we've installed all our packages so we have next we have react we act on them here and this tells us our versions okay so we're good the next step we'll go so I let me organize this a little better for us okay never mind I see where it went it went behind so I'm going to minimize that there we go okay so we need to add this section and these are going to give us some commands we can use straight from the terminal to start our react app to build it to get it ready for production and then to start it as a production app so let's put that in put it down below here and actually I don't think I need these tags do I there yeah that's why I was discovered yeah so I copied in some stuff I didn't need okay but these scripts basically what I'm going to be able to do is just type in yarn dev and it'll automatically run whatever I have on this side of the colon same way with your unbuild yarn started you can chain together things maybe later on we'll get into some more complicated things with this so let's save that and let's see that is that's it I mean that's all you need to get it to get it running okay basically well we need an index page so we'll just use their default index page for now just to show that it works to make sure that it works but we need to make a pages folder so right now we have nothing let's make direct three pages and let's okay so I've just made that file let's go back over to our editor and see we now have pages let me increase the size here okay we have pages on size my size of the code is increasing but I'm not getting this to increase I'm not sure why off to try to figure that out after the video I wonder if yeah I'm not getting an increase so if you can't see this basically I have a folder called pages and now I have an index file index j/s let's let's make sure this is what we needed okay that should be all we need for now we're going to save that I'll explain a little bit more what's going on in a second let's just get it get it started okay so now we're gonna do yarn where's my command line so I just type yarn run dev and that that runs that will run this command here next okay so basically what happens here is it's just started a server okay it's using webpack and it's just started the server and it says it's ready on localhost 3000 so we should be able to see something here I'll bring this up hopefully I don't have anything else running on that port right now her don't mess it up I've had that happen before all right this one this work let me bring this over really small I'll make it bigger okay welcome to next jazz okay so it doesn't seem that impressive we just have one line of text on a page but this is I guess technically a react up the minimum react up and you can see I have a browser extension to show we're running I guess the u.s. not work here we go so it shows we're running react and webpack so this is this is react hey guys sorry I'm annoying the live chat a little bit I just wanted to to get through that without messing up the install so I'm going to scroll through real quick to see if I missed anything important in the live chat it's like hello from Poland Montreal Brazil through Peru Sao Paulo Guatemala LA Italy well awesome gone to bed somebody's from Narnia that's great I love that Ukraine Russia Kansas Pakistan Netherlands wow we got people from all over the place awesome okay so I'm going to explain a little bit about how reacts specifically next j/s with react works and if I'm losing anybody if you need me to go over something more let me know in the in the live chat there's a bit of a delay so I may not see it right away but I'll try to get to it and if I miss with something that you ask in the live chat put it in the comments I always go back and read those comments and I'll respond as soon as I can ok so basically when you're using next let me move this out here and let's let's check out the structure so when you're using next anything you put in this pages folder will be a route that will actually be a page in your app and you are in your website and we next takes care of all the routing for that so it's definitely can only appreciate if you're done without an extra create like that anytime soon okay so I got distracted by the live chat again someone had a good comment in here so you can only appreciate it if you it without next or trait wrecked react app it can be really timeconsuming so yes that is definitely true when I first was trying to learn react and I'll say right up front I am nowhere near an expert at react I'm still in a learning process but when I was really really a newb it react I attempted it several times to do it from scratch with no help and pretty much failed I don't even remember what the result was so it was it wasn't memorable at all but I tried create react app and that was awesome and then I found next and basically I went with next because of the serverside rendering became you know out of the box because I needed that for a project I was doing a few months ago so most awaited video yeah I know everybody wanted the reacts though so anyway yeah I mean at some point if you have the time go ahead and try to do react just straight from scratch there's value in knowing how to do that and how to set things up exactly like you need to but the reality is you just don't always have time I don't know about you but a lot of the projects that I work on just there's just really tight deadlines and I don't have time to do it exactly the way I would want to if I have you know all the time in the world so this is a great timesaver let's go in and let's let's make let's make some other pages and I'm going to duplicate this tab so this is kind of cool about item two I'm sure other terminal applications do this but since I'm running the server now I can't type any commands without stopping this so I just open up a new tab and then I can still check on how the server is going and I have this new tab here so I'm just going to I'm going to CD into this pages directory since we're going to do some stuff in here and let's just make some of the pages that I know we're going to need and you notice these aren't dot HTML all these are dot j/s so you're not going to have any you got HTML pages and your react app about what did we need a team and I'm going to bring up on my other screen all the all the menu links that we'll need I don't need to add them all right now but it would be good to get some some examples okay so we have team we need courses advanced resources okay that's good for now okay so now if you can see all these have been created and I'm going to go in and let's see I should be able to let's just pop this same code in there and we'll just change one word to let us know that it's actually working before we get into action you bring it over content the next couple videos are going to actually be converting that static site that we built the last week converting that into react components I don't think we're gonna have time to get into that now we only have about seven minutes left okay so sorry arranging some stuff on my other screens here let's switch back here and we'll just fill this in I guess we do this one first just to make sure it works and I'll just write about okay so I'll bring this over so check that out I've typed in it might be hard to see here at the top but I've just it's just localhost 3000 slash about and that's our page that's what we built so all that routing is totally taken care of so I don't know if you've ever tried to build a routing from scratch either server side or client side it's timeconsuming and it can be buggy if you're doing it so I I definitely recommend going with this I once did a project where I made a custom router completely myself and then I totally redid it and went with something premade even after I built everything because I realized that this is going to be so hard to maintain I'm I should go with some premade thing that more people are going to know how to use except for just me hey guys get a couple people saying hi alright so what we're going to do is let's try to bring in some we have time let's try to bring in some code alright I showed you the pages let me do show you where the components can live now with next the only folder that you absolutely need to have named something specific is the pages folder so you have to have pages and that's where the default routing is going to take place in you can name your other folders whatever you want I'm just going to name a folder just kind of the default components folder so I'm going to make that folder now and this will this will be where I keep most of my components if you had a really complex site or app you probably would want to break it down into different folders for right now I think this should work we're not going to need a ton of different components so and the components folder let's just make some of the components we know we're going to need so we're going to need a header let's let's call it a home header and let's call the convention home header so I guess it's been about a month or two since I've actually worked with react probably like a month and a half at least at this point the convention I believe if I remember correctly is that your components are all that they're capitalized so that's why I'm capitalizing this so we have the home header remember we had two different versions of the header and then let's have I'm just going to say header for the next one actually let's call it nav I've been calling it nav throughout this whole video series so let's not change it up now and now this just call this regular jeaious we have a that stinky nav is called a sticking up we have that sticky nav we're definitely going to need a footer and so we have all these components let me think we have cards for the team members and that'll be good for now we're going to have more components than that but now we can see we have our components I had learned weapons okay we had another good comment someone said they had to learn web pack to set up react tab they did learn web pack in the process though which was good but they said it was painful I'm definitely with you there for me coming from using it from first using grunt and then moving to gulp and then trying to transition a web pack it was a tough transition for me that's that's why this you know next Jas or something like it like create react react add it takes that off of you so you don't have to learn web pack just to use react if you want to just build something cool and react just to learn it or to start out with then you can just skip that I recommend learning it at some point though but it doesn't hold you back from me being able to do something with react okay so let's bring up let's bring this up so we have our components now and we'll bring up the footer and let me grab I'm going to try to grab some boilerplate here for a component hopefully they have one probably skipping over something this will probably work this is a little bit more than we need but I think this should give us what we want okay so with a few minutes okay I have one minute left I'll just pop this over that's extent actually that's not exactly what we want yes that happens but like I said this is unscripted it's not rehearsed beforehand so I may not be able to get a component built today although I did get a little farther than I thought I was pretty sure that I would mess something up when I was installing everything since it's been so long but I'm not seeing it I'm just going to have to go back to one of my previous react projects and copy something from there it's a good whip it someone says there's a good web pack tutorial that helped them out a lot if you could go ahead and and link to that that might be helpful for everybody if they don't they're not familiar with web pack yet need some extra help let me go the last thing I'll do in this video I'm going to go real quick to one of my other repos and I'm going to just grab some code from a footer component that I did for that repo for that project and I'll pull it in and I use next for that as well let's find this footer okay all right so I got it let me copy this in its going to be a lot at first but let me show you the basics so um importing react component from react in this case I'm importing this let me take this out because I don't have this component now edit mother flip project I'm calling this footer and so and then at the bottom here I'm exporting footer that's the basics that you really need and let me just let me take this out over low so plugin error because I don't have that component let me just real quick double check to make sure that okay I don't think I'm using any other components but this I do want to keep this in basically all I'm doing here is just making sure that that copyright date at the bottom is always current and I guess I don't I don't need this right now this is my Google Analytics tag so obviously I'm going to use a different one and I don't need that right now so let's say that and let me try to bring in into one of our pages so let's try about let me import see if this will work let me see how I do this and I'm going a couple minutes over I apologize for that but since we kind of started this I'd like to just finish up and get one component linked up here alright so yeah I'm just trying to copy and paste some stuff so I don't mess it up and so I can go a little bit faster okay so I'm going to import footer from footer and let's let's actually bring this let's see if this work I'm not sure that this will work but let's try it out all right it worked great let me bring this in everything worked out for me today I didn't mess anything up so it's a good day yesterday I was a little off I messed some stuff up I didn't do my usual pre stream routine yesterday so I don't know if you tuned in yesterday I I don't know if you caught it but I just felt kind of really off but anyway that footer component that we made this is for another one of my my sites that I did so it's not the same info but you can see it brought in everything now what it didn't bring in where any of the styles because we didn't bring that in so try to adjust quality video the screen so blurry by someone saying the screen is blurry credit risk quality yeah on my end it does look like the stream is good at least YouTube's telling me stream is good it should be a 1080p if it's blurry for you is possible that it's a it's your connection I'm pretty new to livestreaming so I might be mistaken but alright so that's that's pretty cool so within basically a half an hour we went from pretty much nothing to installing everything we needed for a serverside rendered react app we created about what like five pages in that app and one component we linked that component up to one of the pages so we did all that now granted I copy and pasted a lot of stuff but you can see how how easily it is to get started with react it looks good okay sorry distracted by the live chat again okay it looks like the video is looking good to some people okay 728 no problem yeah as long as you can get 720 it should be readable anything below that I would think it would be too fuzzy to read the code and I'm sorry for that if you're not able to read it right now it'll be available in about five minutes to watch the the replay maybe you can get it to come through better for you on the recorded version and so thanks for tuning in everybody I will be back tomorrow at the same time next week I'm going to have some some different times I know I have some a meeting on Monday at 200 so I'll have to reschedule that and then I'm going to go to a conference at the end of the week so we'll see maybe I'll do some video from the conference I'll be a syntactic on in Charleston South Carolina so we'll see I guess let me know if anybody's interested in seeing video from that conference maybe I can try to stream something from my phone or we'll see how good the WiFi is but I will be back tomorrow let me know if you have any suggestions for me or if you need me to go over something in more depth and tomorrow we're going to really get into making a lot of components and making some pages so it should be fun all right you're welcome see you guys
