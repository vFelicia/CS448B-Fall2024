00:08 - hey everybody its Jessie welcome to live
00:11 - coding with Jessie if you're watching
00:15 - this recording later because you were
00:17 - expecting the stream to be later on at
00:21 - my normal time 2:00 p.m. Eastern I'm
00:24 - very sorry I I intended to stream at
00:28 - 2:00 p.m. and I tweeted that I would be
00:30 - streaming at 2:00 p.m. and then about 5
00:33 - minutes ago I realized that I had set
00:36 - the stream to go live at 11 a.m. Eastern
00:40 - time so I'm not even sure how many
00:44 - people are gonna be watching this live
00:46 - because it's it's so much earlier than
00:48 - normal and I told everybody the wrong
00:51 - time so apologies again but I thought I
00:58 - could have either canceled that stream
01:00 - or made it postponed it or I could have
01:05 - just put out on Twitter that hey I'm in
01:08 - a stream right now so I chose the latter
01:10 - because they're already about 4 or 5
01:12 - people waiting for the stream when I
01:15 - found out so I didn't want to leave them
01:16 - hanging
01:20 - so I mean everybody I guess would have
01:24 - initially got the notification from
01:27 - YouTube for the right time so maybe
01:29 - that'll help it looks like I do have
01:32 - some people in here so awesome hey it's
01:35 - actually not bad when I do it at a
01:37 - different time sometimes there are
01:39 - people who just can't watch the stream
01:41 - at my normal time so now maybe we'll
01:43 - have some new faces who watch the
01:45 - recordings but don't get to participate
01:46 - live okay so I'm I wasn't planning on
01:55 - working on this yet I was gonna work on
01:56 - some other stuff but we're gonna work
01:58 - more on this as you can see I've done
02:00 - pretty much nothing this still looks
02:02 - kind of broken like we left it on Friday
02:08 - so didn't work on pretty much anything
02:12 - yesterday
02:13 - I wasn't feeling well just stayed home
02:16 - well I should say that I worked on my
02:19 - Udacity project so I finally got that to
02:22 - the point where I was confident to turn
02:25 - it in so I don't have it ready to show
02:28 - you today so sometime this week maybe oh
02:34 - I'll show you all I don't have it up and
02:36 - running anywhere
02:38 - but I can just have it running locally
02:41 - and just show it to everybody let's see
02:45 - what else did I want to say oh okay so I
02:49 - don't know I'm sure you all saw that I'm
02:53 - sure a lot of you saw that we got so we
02:55 - as in free code camps YouTube channel
02:58 - got a silver play button from YouTube
03:02 - which is really cool so Quincy made a
03:04 - video and posted it last night and so
03:10 - check that out if you don't know what
03:12 - that is when a YouTube channel gets to a
03:14 - hundred thousand subscribers they get
03:16 - this silver play button
03:19 - you know framed and it's really cool so
03:23 - we're actually over two hundred thousand
03:24 - subscribers now but it's still really
03:28 - cool that we got that so I'm excited and
03:33 - also quits
03:35 - Quincy thanked all the YouTube people
03:39 - and so my name was in there too and I
03:41 - was just that was really cool I was I'm
03:44 - still like I'm still very appreciative
03:47 - that for this opportunity to to
03:52 - contribute to free code camp so anyway
03:55 - and I'm glad that I could help in some
03:57 - way and you know reaching the subscriber
04:00 - count that we have now okay let me let
04:06 - me get started yes so we got we got a
04:07 - decent amount of viewers right now so
04:09 - let's go ahead and
04:12 - get started so I said hello what's up
04:15 - take my so so I think somebody wants me
04:17 - to say their name on youtube so Abdul
04:20 - Wahab I think that's it Abdul Wahab
04:26 - sorry you all know I try really hard to
04:29 - pronounce names correctly so if I don't
04:32 - pronounce your name correctly let me
04:33 - know all right so have a lot of people
04:37 - saying congratulations in the live chat
04:39 - thank you so much
04:41 - I mean really it's you all that that did
04:43 - that right I mean you you're the ones
04:45 - that subscribe so yeah it's it's amazing
04:52 - I don't know what to think that anyway
04:55 - I'm gonna get to coding but I'm just
04:58 - really it's just really cool let's see
05:03 - all right so let me at least tell you
05:06 - what I've done I've done a lot of prep
05:09 - work to get ready to do this so I was
05:13 - just really having trouble with this
05:16 - design in terms of just not there's a
05:20 - lot of content on the page so it's it's
05:24 - really difficult because my design style
05:27 - is usually like very minimal so I was
05:30 - having a lot of trouble figuring out
05:32 - like where where everything was going to
05:34 - go how I could keep a lot of the content
05:37 - and not have it be cluttered so usually
05:42 - when I'm at the beginning stages of
05:44 - design and I get stuck I just look for
05:47 - inspiration so I looked at a lot of
05:49 - material design sites a lot of you know
05:52 - the Google Sites and I got some really
05:57 - good ideas to incorporate at least I
06:01 - think they look they're pretty good at
06:03 - least the way they were executed on the
06:05 - sites that I saw so I think it's gonna
06:08 - work out I have a much more clear plan
06:12 - now so let's get let's get to it
06:23 - okay
06:30 - let's build out this this the frame for
06:33 - all the sections first right so I know
06:37 - about how many sections are gonna be so
06:40 - I think it would be better visually to
06:44 - just have all those sections with some
06:45 - headers in there and then we can start
06:48 - putting things in and that'll maybe help
06:51 - a little bit to get what's in my head
06:54 - conveyed to you all as quickly as
06:56 - possible that's always tough I usually
07:01 - have but you know a vision in my head of
07:04 - what it's going to look like but trying
07:07 - to convey that to other people is not
07:08 - always easy my my drawing skills are not
07:15 - great so I try to sketch it out but it
07:20 - never looks the same okay so let's see
07:23 - we just need some we need some sections
07:30 - and actually we're gonna we're gonna
07:33 - take out a lot of this right so I I'm
07:42 - done with the with the Carousel idea or
07:48 - even the accordion so I have a different
07:50 - idea for this section and then for our
07:54 - news and events section so at first for
07:58 - this section we're just gonna have a few
08:01 - cards across and if we need to if we
08:06 - really want to have more than a few
08:08 - cards we could potentially just have a
08:13 - large scroller all right so that it'll
08:17 - it'll just shift across so we'll
08:20 - probably build that I don't know I'm
08:26 - thinking that we'll just build that from
08:30 - scratch maybe we use what's with
08:33 - materialise we'll see I'm undecided
08:36 - still it'll be the faster way to do it
08:38 - let me start my timer before I forget so
08:43 - if you are new you haven't seen this
08:45 - before I do 25 minute sessions of code
08:47 - and then in between I do five-minute
08:50 - sessions of question and answer and then
08:53 - at the end I finish out and I'll answer
08:56 - any of the questions that are in the
08:57 - live chat so I always do at least two
09:00 - Pomodoro sessions of 25 minutes I'm
09:03 - definitely going to do two today and
09:05 - then we'll see how things go all right
09:11 - so let's just get some basics let's see
09:18 - what name I gave this class so okay so
09:22 - this is all in a container right now I
09:24 - don't want to make everything in a
09:26 - container I think what we'll end up
09:32 - doing is having sections in those
09:34 - sections that we want to be contained so
09:37 - have this space on the sides here
09:40 - we'll then put the container inside the
09:44 - section but I would like to have you
09:46 - know as we're doing here full width
09:48 - sections so so like this so right now I
09:56 - guess it's okay if I do these in rows
09:59 - and one way I do do them in sections so
10:11 - section there we go
10:30 - oops can I do that no all right so if
10:38 - you confuse this to what I was just
10:39 - going right there Visual Studio code
10:42 - comes with Emmet Emmet is a shorthand
10:45 - oops a way to kind of do shorthand and
10:48 - then have it automatically turn it into
10:50 - HTML so I'm I'm learning how to do it so
10:57 - far it's a really cool feature you can
10:59 - see how easy that was
11:00 - and so right now I'm just gonna put in
11:11 - I'm just gonna put in the text it just
11:13 - says column just so that there's
11:15 - something we can see with this structure
11:18 - not every section is going to have the
11:20 - same structure but it's going to be you
11:24 - know this will be kind of a nice base
11:26 - structure that we can work off of is a
11:28 - section with two columns we're gonna
11:33 - have yeah so some of the sections we
11:37 - will want that container in as well but
11:41 - I'm not gonna put that in there right
11:42 - now
11:43 - we'll also want see let's put a header
11:48 - in here as well h2 section there we go
11:56 - alright so this will give us an idea
11:59 - right now I'm thinking we'll probably
12:04 - have another
12:11 - I'm gonna start with with section but
12:14 - maybe like five more sections and then
12:17 - see how that looks okay great here's the
12:25 - section for now I think I'm gonna take
12:26 - out this banner or at least comment out
12:29 - the banner let's just comment it out for
12:33 - now okay and let's take out I didn't
12:45 - want to put a different image in here I
12:47 - just keep forgetting let's take out
12:50 - these for a least change it up I'm gonna
12:54 - go back to what we had originally which
12:56 - was just a card like this just three of
12:59 - them I I wonder I think I'm gonna try to
13:07 - put in the actual texts that are in some
13:09 - of these now on the main site that the
13:12 - live version of this site and see how it
13:15 - looks if we can get away with making the
13:17 - cards a little bit smaller we might be
13:19 - able to go with four across on a large
13:21 - screen so I think I think that would
13:25 - work out so this is what we want
13:39 - and
13:52 - all right so let's go inside this row
13:56 - put two more of these in oh man what was
14:02 - the there was a hot key there was a hot
14:07 - key for formatting things automatically
14:09 - what was it I don't remember what it was
14:18 - um I'll have to look back at the last
14:23 - video whenever I I learned what the hot
14:27 - key was and then fixed that formatting
14:29 - because right now that's terrible
14:30 - all right this is make sure you did that
14:32 - right okay great
14:36 - let's grab grab some of the actual text
14:52 - man are these is this a text it's just I
14:55 - think that's part of the image is it
15:00 - let's see
15:08 - I'm gonna inspect that to see if that's
15:11 - all just an image enough how do we have
15:18 - five okay
15:25 - okay so that's actual sex oh wow
15:30 - all right okay so each each line is
15:33 - actually in its own in its own div
15:36 - interesting okay so I guess I'll just
15:40 - type this out it seems like that'll be
15:44 - the easiest thing to do so I'm gonna
15:47 - move this over to my other screen so
15:50 - that I can type it easily all right I
15:58 - guess some answers to the Auto
15:59 - formatting but I have have different
16:01 - answers control Kennedy all right let's
16:04 - try this
16:06 - whoa okay the control k/d did not work
16:19 - that did not work let's try this over
16:24 - wish okay so for not working thanks for
16:31 - the advice though I let's see oh I'll
16:35 - figure it out I can always go back and
16:37 - check the last stream okay I don't know
16:45 - if you all noticed in the last stream
16:47 - but several of my co-workers were
16:52 - peeking in the door and doing silly
16:56 - things so I didn't realize how many of
17:01 - them were doing it and so they told me
17:03 - after the stream and then I went through
17:05 - and and saw it so I guess that'll be
17:09 - some nice Easter eggs to look for now
17:13 - okay so I'm not sure if we even want to
17:17 - have the card title
17:22 - there's not really anything now on the
17:25 - card that that I think would be good for
17:32 - the title
17:40 - I mean unless let's try this let's try
17:43 - to put the students name where the title
17:45 - is and then include their quote and then
17:48 - just have a read more link we'll see how
17:51 - that looks
17:58 - all right so Shannon and I want to put
18:06 - this in quotation marks so it's clear
18:09 - that it's a quote this automatically
18:25 - type server and this instead of serve
18:31 - okay that was good and then let's
18:43 - see how it looks okay yeah that's that's
18:49 - a really small amount of text let's try
18:54 - to get away with doing four cards then
18:56 - and so I could definitely I could see a
19:00 - few benefits to doing four cards I think
19:05 - five would be pushing it but four cards
19:09 - would allow us to use much smaller
19:12 - images as long as we keep it consistent
19:17 - and you know potentially even on a small
19:21 - screen we could drop down to two columns
19:23 - so that we would never have anything
19:24 - like as big as that right and then we'd
19:30 - be able to display more you know right
19:33 - away without having to click in one way
19:36 - or another
19:37 - and I'm open I mean I'm I think I'm
19:42 - gonna suggest that we just we don't have
19:44 - five stories like we have now I think we
19:49 - should just have three or four stories
19:51 - and then if we want to change them out
19:53 - more frequently that's totally fine but
19:57 - I don't know when it comes to like
20:01 - carousels like this the statistics at
20:06 - least that I've read show that you know
20:09 - barely anybody ever gets to the fifth
20:11 - one the percentage drops significantly
20:12 - after the first and you know after the
20:15 - second one so most users don't even get
20:18 - to this point so I think it would be
20:20 - better to just have a few visible
20:24 - immediately and what the user is much
20:29 - more likely to actually look at that and
20:31 - read that I definitely want to set it up
20:35 - so that these are always the same same
20:39 - height so probably won't work on that
20:42 - today I know we've done things like that
20:44 - in previous projects so I may not do it
20:46 - on the stream we'll just mostly we're
20:49 - where we get with it
20:53 - okay so let's let me add one more card
21:08 - she's gonna add one more card here and
21:11 - then let me change these so what we want
21:21 - is this to be 3 and then medium can be
21:32 - dropped to 4 that's gonna look weird I
21:36 - think we don't want that let's go with
21:43 - medium 3 small 6 ok so on small screens
21:53 - each card each column is going to take
21:57 - up 6 of their 12 columns so 6 of those
22:02 - are going to be taken up by the first
22:05 - column second column left 6 and then
22:08 - over here each one's gonna take up 3 so
22:11 - we'll show you what that looks like
22:15 - ok so you see as we get smaller at some
22:21 - point it goes to two okay and that's not
22:30 - bad I mean I don't like how long these
22:32 - cards are but I'm I'm okay with this
22:34 - this isn't really you know this isn't
22:37 - too bad and for right now I'm sticking
22:42 - with the column classes that are built
22:44 - in to materialise but if we really want
22:46 - to have more control over things we
22:49 - could always you know set our own
22:52 - breakpoints do some different things
22:54 - with that occasionally you know I've had
22:57 - to do that okay so I'm gonna leave this
22:59 - like this for now it gives a general
23:01 - idea of what this could look like and
23:04 - it's something that I could show my boss
23:06 - to show other people to just get get
23:08 - them thinking so normally the process
23:10 - goes I consult with my boss or whoever
23:13 - is has the information for the project
23:17 - just kind of talk about some things
23:20 - sometimes I'll scan
23:21 - things out get some immediate feedback
23:23 - then I go to work and actually build
23:26 - something out just usually with a lot of
23:30 - you know content like this right you
23:32 - know obviously this is not ready to go
23:35 - get alive but it gives you know a better
23:38 - visual you know something you can
23:40 - actually interact with then I go back to
23:44 - my boss or whoever and get some more
23:46 - feedback and it will change so what
23:48 - we're doing now is probably not going to
23:51 - be the final version of this but we just
23:55 - want to kind of get our ideas out you
23:58 - know actually kind of build out not
24:01 - completely but just kind of roughly all
24:05 - right so for the news section which will
24:09 - be our next section I think I may have
24:14 - some sections that are banners in
24:16 - between just to break up all the white
24:17 - but I'm not going to do that right now
24:20 - we'll get everything on here see how it
24:22 - looks and then see if we need that I
24:25 - also have another I have another idea
24:31 - that I might put into place I've noticed
24:33 - on some of Google's sites that they they
24:36 - don't have the cards automatically
24:38 - visible they're only visible when you
24:39 - hover over them let me show you an
24:42 - example and I want to see what you all
24:44 - think about that it's a little bit
24:48 - different for me I'm not I'm not really
24:52 - used to it
24:54 - but I'm not I'm not opposed to it it's
25:00 - interesting so here we go fine let me
25:05 - bring this over okay so check this out
25:08 - so this first this is the design Google
25:12 - and so you hover over this and now it
25:18 - becomes a card and the entire thing is
25:21 - clickable down here it's that it's the
25:24 - same is it
25:26 - anything I thought it was for this I
25:28 - guess not here it is okay so for these
25:30 - ones it's the same thing it's clickable
25:33 - now here's the the advantage of this I
25:38 - think this is really cool so notice that
25:42 - these are not the same heights but it's
25:48 - not obvious that they're not the same
25:50 - height right away but if you hover over
25:54 - them you could definitely tell but since
25:55 - they're never both visible at the same
25:57 - time you don't immediately get that idea
26:01 - that like wow these are really off right
26:03 - so I love that because one of the one of
26:07 - the big issues always when I'm doing
26:10 - things with cards is you know getting
26:13 - them all to be the same the same height
26:17 - and sometimes I don't have control over
26:20 - the content I advised that we you know
26:23 - try to have uniform content and try to
26:25 - have as little text content as possible
26:27 - and but I don't always have control over
26:31 - that so for instance here if one of
26:34 - these were large this card I could get
26:37 - the card to be the same height but
26:38 - there'd still be lots of white space
26:39 - inside it doesn't seem like it's not
26:43 - obviously you know so different when the
26:47 - white space is inside but it's still a
26:50 - little bit weird sometimes so I'm
26:53 - thinking about going with something like
26:55 - this I don't think this is built into
27:00 - materializes something we'd have to do
27:01 - on our own don't think it would be that
27:04 - difficult though so anyway let me know
27:10 - what you think so I'm not gonna look at
27:12 - the live chat right now but when the
27:14 - timer goes off when we do our our first
27:16 - five minutes the first part of that
27:19 - first thing I'm going to look at is that
27:20 - and see what you all think so for now
27:24 - I'm just gonna do the cards like normal
27:27 - but we may be switching to that that's
27:30 - that's definitely going to be a
27:31 - different it's going to be different
27:33 - than anything else we've done so
27:36 - so I'm okay with doing it because I I
27:39 - think there are there are a lot of
27:43 - benefits I think it gives us a lot more
27:45 - freedom doing it like this so we'll see
27:51 - but for the newsfeed I liked how it was
27:55 - done here so not every piece of news has
28:00 - to have an image right you we have here
28:04 - and we may not do it exactly like this
28:05 - we have one main piece of news that does
28:09 - have an image and then the rest of them
28:13 - we just have the the titles and you know
28:19 - just a little snippet so I like that you
28:26 - know we have the more news up here so I
28:29 - think we're going to go with something
28:31 - like this the news right now on the site
28:37 - we have so we do have images but we
28:41 - don't these images aren't always I think
28:44 - the best right so certainly some stories
28:49 - will have images that could be used but
28:52 - I don't think every story necessarily
28:54 - needs an image with it right I mean this
29:00 - if we're going to use an image it should
29:03 - add to the understanding of what's
29:06 - happening all right it should draw you
29:08 - know draw your eye like recive right now
29:10 - I can't even read this stuff down here
29:14 - it's hard to read this and I'm pretty
29:18 - close to my screen right now so now
29:24 - right if we add you know maybe a really
29:26 - well-known person like like father
29:29 - Scanlon really well-known at this
29:33 - university so a picture of father
29:36 - Scanlon would definitely be appropriate
29:38 - to have for a news story but logos I
29:44 - don't know
29:46 - so I like the idea that in this setup we
29:49 - could have something with an image and
29:51 - things without an image and it looks
29:53 - fine earlier the way I was going to do
29:58 - it I don't know that it would look it
30:02 - would look good we would be forced to
30:03 - always have an image and a certain and
30:06 - image with certain dimensions for every
30:08 - story so let me check my time before I
30:13 - try to implement this okay we got about
30:15 - three and a half minutes so let's try to
30:18 - do as much as we can here it looks like
30:20 - basically we'll have mm I mean we're
30:30 - definitely gonna have two columns see
30:34 - we're gonna want these columns to be
30:36 - inside a container
30:44 - okay so we're already set up for two
30:47 - calls we just need to add the container
30:49 - first and then let's make I keep
30:52 - thinking in terms of react component I
30:54 - almost said we're gonna make a component
30:55 - for this but we we can't we're not not
30:58 - using react so which we're just gonna
31:04 - write the mark-up for this for you know
31:07 - for something like this I'm not gonna
31:09 - try to match this exactly I actually
31:11 - really don't like doing that I feel
31:15 - weird copying someone's design exactly I
31:18 - don't mind taking some inspiration from
31:20 - it you know the general concept of
31:23 - having stories with and without images
31:24 - but you know I don't want to try to copy
31:28 - fonts spacing everything so we're gonna
31:32 - try to adapt it and kind of make it our
31:35 - own
31:37 - let's see so we have section right all
31:50 - right so this is this I think it's the
31:52 - section that we want you start getting
31:56 - names on these sections it'll be a lot
31:58 - easier and we can potentially break
32:02 - these out into components if we need to
32:04 - I think I mentioned that before if this
32:06 - component starts getting huge then
32:10 - probably be better for organization to
32:13 - break it out all right so you say news
32:18 - and we got to put this in a container
32:24 - right so what we can do then is probably
32:28 - the easiest way to do this I think is to
32:31 - make the container just add the class
32:34 - container on this section in previous
32:38 - projects I've added a container inside
32:41 - the section but I think maybe I had a
32:45 - good reason for that and I forget but I
32:47 - think it's unnecessary to have an extra
32:50 - div just to add this extra class so
32:53 - we're gonna try it like this I think it
32:55 - should be fine
32:58 - just to test it let's make sure this
33:01 - should there we go so now this does have
33:04 - margins on the side and let's
33:23 - thank God I want to quit having to load
33:26 - that image every single time so I'm
33:30 - gonna comment it out for now the big
33:32 - hero image I just I feel bad like
33:37 - continuously hitting the unsplash was
33:42 - unsplash thought I T sermons so my timer
33:47 - is up now anyway let me find that CSS
33:50 - file
34:09 - let's take that
34:18 - okay all right so let me go to the live
34:22 - chat now and then we'll we'll fill this
34:24 - in my my timer it's hidden there we go
34:31 - all right okay
34:49 - okay so so so Tony says I upload the
34:57 - Google design cards okay cool so we got
34:59 - one vote for the um I'm assuming you
35:04 - mean like this this how we how they do
35:06 - it here John says same hiding cards is
35:11 - easy with Flex CSS attribute stretch or
35:15 - in grid it's even easier now I know
35:18 - great I will yeah I know there are some
35:21 - ways that I have used that make the
35:23 - cards getting the same height in the
35:28 - card it's a lot easier let's see alright
35:35 - so that seems like it was
35:44 - it looks like that's that's all for the
35:47 - opinions about the card design so I'm
35:49 - going to scroll up and try to see if
35:51 - there are any questions
36:08 - Harshit says congratulations your silver
36:11 - play button and may free code can't
36:13 - progress it so it reaches more than a
36:15 - million subs that would be cool
36:17 - did they give you a gold button at a
36:19 - million subs I'm not sure I would have
36:23 - this I would imagine the next step would
36:25 - be gold button right that would be
36:31 - really cool to get a million
36:43 - okay Brando asked about the IDE it's
36:47 - it's Visual Studio code so I don't know
36:50 - if I would call that an IDE but that's
36:53 - the code editor that I'm using today
37:09 - okay cool no D says it's been a while
37:13 - because the streams are always late but
37:16 - glad to see it today so that's awesome
37:18 - I'm I'm really glad that you get to see
37:21 - the stream now so I like I said I know
37:23 - there are people that watch the the
37:25 - videos that don't get to stream because
37:27 - of the time so cool I'm glad you can
37:29 - gladly ask it says am i late
37:38 - yeah I'm I'm actually early so you are
37:42 - you're a little bit late maybe about a
37:43 - half hour I started that about a half
37:46 - hour ago so but it's it's my fault I
37:50 - started way earlier than normal without
37:52 - very much notice to everyone
38:05 - okay so nobody asks if I write unit
38:11 - tests when coding unfortunately I don't
38:14 - write tests when coding so I did have on
38:19 - the last project Kevin who's frequently
38:23 - in the in the live chat and contributes
38:25 - on github set up some some testing stuff
38:29 - and I did end up going through and
38:32 - editing a lot of the the tests that he
38:35 - set up and was learning how to do that
38:37 - that was what do you say it was end end
38:41 - testing so I would like to be able to do
38:47 - tests I just am not really I don't know
38:50 - enough about it right now I'd like to
38:52 - find some good training materials on
38:54 - testing right now I have no time to do
38:58 - anything else until my nano degree is
39:01 - finished so it'll probably happen is
39:05 - I'll finish my nano degree by the end of
39:10 - October then I'll probably have to work
39:13 - on my talk for November then after that
39:18 - I'll probably have time to learn
39:20 - something new
39:21 - in that case I think testing should be
39:24 - the next thing I learned
39:25 - we'll see unless something else comes up
39:29 - anyway so I really do want to do testing
39:32 - it's just not something that I've that
39:35 - I've learned all right we got one
39:42 - question at the end that I just have to
39:44 - read so says which would you rather
39:48 - fight this is Ruben says which would you
39:52 - rather fight one hundred duck-sized
39:54 - horses or one horse-sized duck is that
40:01 - and this is so weird cuz I just I just
40:04 - saw somebody else just ask this question
40:08 - my cousin's husband asked this question
40:13 - and she posted it on Facebook so where
40:16 - is this question from I feel like I'm
40:18 - missing some reference but anyway that's
40:23 - a good question so I'm not gonna give my
40:25 - answer yet if you'd like to answer in
40:27 - the live chat let me know and then on
40:31 - the next 5-minute break
40:33 - I'll read out the answers and I'll give
40:34 - my answer I would hate to influence you
40:37 - all on such an important matter so what
40:40 - would you rather fight a hundred
40:41 - duck-sized horses or one horse-sized
40:43 - duck that sounds like a good question
40:53 - for my kids I gotta remember to ask him
40:54 - later on they'll probably my oldest son
40:58 - Rafael will probably just like try to
41:00 - think it out for you know four hours and
41:03 - he'll be trying to come up well maybe if
41:05 - you did this all right
41:08 - so okay cool let's build this now
41:24 - where to go
41:27 - there we go I'm like I'm gonna separate
41:31 - these sections out with some spaces just
41:35 - I can keep it straight I normally would
41:38 - not put this many spaces between things
41:40 - but I don't want to have to keep
41:41 - searching for it okay
41:56 - alright so in this section we'll have
42:09 - and we want to give this hh4 maybe so
42:16 - let's give it give it a div forgot
42:26 - forgot to do that I'm gonna force myself
42:28 - to do this I remember
42:53 - so it'll actually let me let me put in
42:58 - some of the actual news that we have
43:14 - and
43:17 - let's put this paragraph in here and
43:22 - then I also want to put in let's put in
43:24 - an image
43:37 - when you grab this source over here wow
43:42 - that's really cool that it automatically
43:43 - puts the source and the all
44:11 - text
44:20 - and
44:24 - okay actually the title is the link
44:35 - so I'm not worried about that right now
44:38 - but this will end up being a link let's
44:45 - see what that looks like
44:46 - and then I'm just gonna copy this now
44:49 - and paste it here and then let's remove
44:58 - this whoops I'm sorry I meant to remove
45:03 - the image
45:14 - and then we'll copy it a few times
45:28 - I see that gives us
45:37 - okay not not too bad at first so what we
45:45 - want to do I actually really like the
45:50 - idea of putting the date right because
45:55 - right now our stories don't have the
45:57 - date I mean that gives us the advantage
45:59 - of let's say we don't update our stories
46:02 - very often it's not obvious that they're
46:04 - not updated but I don't know I think I
46:14 - think I'd like to have the date in there
46:16 - I guess the problem is right now if
46:19 - we're not pulling the date in I'm not
46:21 - sure how we would pull the date in
46:23 - because I have no idea how to so like
46:31 - this would be the equip setting this up
46:33 - in Ektron which is the content
46:35 - management system that this site uses
46:37 - would be I don't know what it's called
46:40 - an extra on but like in WordPress terms
46:42 - it would be a custom post type so I
46:47 - don't know how to make a custom post
46:50 - type in Extron or to get data from a
46:54 - post siphon Ektron so I'll have to learn
46:57 - a lot more before that can happen so for
46:59 - now I'm gonna leave off the dates
47:01 - because I know for sure we can grab
47:03 - these pieces of data because I can just
47:05 - look and see how we're doing it now if I
47:09 - do figure out how to grab the date great
47:12 - I'll grab the date otherwise I'm just
47:17 - I'm not gonna worry about it I'm
47:19 - definitely not gonna worry about it now
47:21 - we're just trying it you know show
47:22 - something on the page all right so I'm
47:27 - just I want to clean this up a little
47:29 - bit I don't want to spend you know a ton
47:31 - of time on it but I think there's a few
47:35 - things that we could do so for now I
47:38 - think these these titles are way too big
47:48 - so we need to drop those down we
47:54 - definitely need to get rid of that
47:55 - character up I'm not worried about it
47:57 - right now but at some point we need to
48:00 - and then the image
48:14 - I'm not sure what we can do about so I
48:17 - mean ideally we would have an image that
48:19 - took up you know the full full space
48:23 - here but without editing this image I
48:27 - don't see how that's gonna happen so
48:31 - we'll just leave it all right so let's
48:39 - drop these down what are the age for is
48:41 - now let's try to drop them down this we
48:49 - can see what age oops
48:51 - what age five looks like
49:05 - okay
49:11 - I think that's all
49:17 - multiple cursors is so useful okay all
49:20 - right that's much better that's the size
49:22 - that I was initially thinking of okay
49:26 - great
49:27 - so that's good I would probably I mean
49:32 - this is pretty obvious that the title
49:34 - goes with this text but you know maybe
49:37 - we could do something add a little bit
49:40 - more space here and tighten this up here
49:43 - but for now that gives the general idea
49:46 - the only other thing we want to have
49:49 - here is you know like a read more
50:03 - I guess we could put it over here the
50:10 - only other place that would make sense
50:12 - is to have something down here that said
50:14 - read more
50:23 - I'm actually not sure that we even have
50:25 - that right now okay so we do have a more
50:29 - link right now and it is at the bottom
50:43 - I don't know why I'm thinking so much
50:45 - about whether to put it at the top of
50:46 - the bottom I think I'm gonna put it at
50:48 - the bottom honestly and the only reason
50:51 - why I'm gonna put at the bottom is as I
50:53 - said I don't like to copy people's
50:55 - designs exactly and so we are leaving
50:58 - out some things but you know putting
51:01 - putting this at the top I'm if there's
51:06 - something that I can try to not copy
51:08 - that's kind of not really important I
51:11 - can put that down here so I know it's a
51:15 - small thing but I'm just gonna put it
51:19 - down here for now we'll see how how it
51:20 - looks all right so let's get section
51:28 - yeah you know the bottom of this section
51:33 - let's put in
51:51 - and for now I don't want it to go
51:54 - anywhere
52:08 - okay
52:15 - so we're gonna have to style this a bit
52:18 - right so I wanted over on this side some
52:23 - suspect that and this might actually be
52:26 - pretty simple well somewhat right so I I
52:33 - do want it on this side on a large
52:35 - screen but on a small screen you
52:36 - probably won't look right on that side
52:38 - so for now I'm not gonna worry about
52:41 - that but I would probably want it
52:44 - aligned this way on a small screen below
52:46 - below these so maybe we can just
53:00 - see I don't want to do it everywhere
53:31 - there we go okay so if you can see what
53:33 - I did there
53:35 - so initially this was all the way over
53:38 - here because when you use
53:40 - position:absolute on an element it is
53:43 - absolute in relation to the parent
53:47 - element that has a position of relative
53:51 - so if it's immediate parent element
53:53 - which in this case was this section then
53:56 - if the media parent element is not
53:59 - position relative it goes up to the next
54:01 - one so it went up to a probably this div
54:05 - may be further up I mean obviously like
54:08 - the entire window could be potentially
54:11 - you know it could go up to there if
54:14 - nothing has positioned relative so for
54:16 - right now it shouldn't affect anything
54:20 - on the page that I've made this position
54:22 - relative but you notice as soon as I
54:26 - made this parent div have a position of
54:29 - relative this went right back into place
54:31 - and now it is aligned zero pixels from
54:37 - the right side of that div so for now
54:42 - this is okay probably would not have it
54:45 - be zero pixels I it might look better if
54:47 - it was shifted in a little bit but I'm
54:49 - okay with it for now but that's kind of
54:53 - a really tricky thing with CSS
54:56 - positioning so if you're having trouble
54:59 - with absolute positioning remember
55:01 - relative it probably took me years
55:03 - before I finally remembered that without
55:06 - having to look it up okay so
55:17 - let me put
55:30 - I don't know if I want to make every
55:32 - section position:relative so I'm just
55:36 - gonna put it in line for this one react
55:42 - is ruined me in terms of inline Styles I
55:44 - never did it before
55:55 - wait what why is he giving me a green
55:57 - underline don't use empty one style
56:16 - that it these wispy styles was wrong
56:19 - with me why don't I remember that
56:34 - yet
56:40 - okay for this one we actually have a
56:42 - unique class so we can put that in the
56:44 - CSS
56:58 - I don't know what I called it now more
57:00 - link okay
57:11 - what can we do position:absolute and
57:18 - right zero okay let's try that out
57:28 - see I knew it was what did I do wrong
57:40 - yeah
57:50 - CEOs position
57:55 - I just can't spell it's my problem there
58:01 - we go okay a little longer than it
58:03 - should have taken but now it not works
58:06 - alright so cool so that's my my idea for
58:09 - the new section for the events section
58:14 - I'm not gonna put them in right now
58:17 - because I want to check there's there's
58:22 - been like some discussion of doing
58:25 - events differently so there may be an
58:30 - API that I can tap into to pull an
58:32 - events so I'd like to get a little bit
58:36 - more information before I put any effort
58:37 - into how I'm going to display events
58:39 - because I don't know that I think that
58:45 - whatever I do is likely to change based
58:48 - on what's decided about how we're
58:51 - handling events alright so next section
58:56 - well let me check my time all right
59:00 - seven minutes cool for the next section
59:04 - let me show you some of what my
59:07 - inspiration is for these sections where
59:13 - do I put my
59:25 - okay so the Google developers sites at
59:29 - developers.google.com also as you know
59:33 - material design in use here but they
59:41 - have so obviously you know these are
59:45 - normal cards you know we're going to be
59:48 - using those but they have these sections
59:51 - here where it's some some visual things
59:57 - so probably be an image in our case and
60:01 - then they just have some information and
60:03 - a button now acts I have done this
60:06 - before on several different sites so
60:09 - it's not something completely new to me
60:12 - but I like how so when I've done it
60:16 - before this has been very large so like
60:19 - a big image complete sections lots of
60:21 - padding but what's unique in terms of at
60:26 - least what I've seen is how tight this
60:29 - is right so this seems as if it's one
60:31 - section and these are just a part of
60:36 - that one section I really like that and
60:39 - I've never done that before I think this
60:41 - will be good for what we need to do
60:43 - because you know if you remember on that
60:45 - main site we just have so much
60:49 - information in each section so we kind
60:52 - of need a way to break that up since
60:54 - we're not going to use these columns you
61:00 - know for instance a section like this I
61:03 - mean academics could be the main title
61:10 - here but it's like what do we do with
61:15 - all this information so I think we could
61:19 - incorporate some of this and split it up
61:22 - so that it looks something more like
61:27 - this you know a lot of space but still
61:29 - has information still has the name links
61:31 - I'm just gonna pick some of this out of
61:35 - here to put here just as an example
61:38 - just to show my show my boss what could
61:40 - happen and then he can start thinking
61:42 - about okay what information is the most
61:44 - important in this section what
61:46 - information can we cut out what do we
61:48 - have to keep and then now that he knows
61:51 - the framework of how it would fit in
61:53 - there it'll be much easier for him to
61:55 - say all right this is this is what we're
61:57 - gonna put in here right so that's not
61:59 - really it's not really up to me it's not
62:01 - really what I like to do so I'm not I'm
62:04 - not gonna try to do it I'm just gonna
62:05 - worry about design honestly it doesn't
62:07 - even matter what I put in here you know
62:11 - anything as long any placeholder will
62:14 - work so I'm gonna use kind of this idea
62:20 - for some of the sections and it will be
62:25 - interspersed I think with sections
62:27 - that'll be you know more like just cards
62:30 - with information so you know for
62:36 - instance something like this could end
62:40 - up being more like you know a section
62:42 - with with columns so we could include if
62:46 - we want some more some more videos to be
62:51 - honest with you I don't even I'm not
62:53 - sure about it keeping these I really
62:56 - need to do some some click tracking and
62:59 - see how many people you know watch these
63:04 - because that's the section that could
63:06 - take up a lot of space so if it's not
63:12 - useful to the people visiting the site
63:14 - then we may as well you know just take
63:17 - it out of there yeah so I think each of
63:22 - these sections would work like that my
63:24 - other thought I think I'll just put it
63:26 - in this first design is that we don't
63:29 - need to have so many sections so
63:32 - academics and admissions I think
63:39 - I think we could place them together so
63:41 - basically our tagline is academically
63:44 - excellent passionately Catholic I think
63:47 - those should be the sections that we
63:49 - have because those are the things we
63:50 - want to emphasize to our potential
63:52 - students so the draw of Franciscan
63:55 - University it's in a niche market and
63:57 - the niche market is people who are who
64:02 - are Catholics who really want so the you
64:08 - know teenagers who really want to you
64:10 - know deepen their knowledge of
64:12 - Catholicism alright because this school
64:14 - is known for being really good at
64:18 - teaching that it graduates the most
64:21 - theology majors out of any school in the
64:23 - country so that's where you know we want
64:27 - to have such a passionate Catholic but
64:28 - what we want to also do is is emphasize
64:31 - academically excellent because our
64:35 - reputation in terms of being good at
64:38 - teaching Catholicism is established
64:40 - right it's established and generally
64:42 - it's not it's it's it's not usually
64:45 - questioned among our target audience but
64:48 - what we need to establish is our
64:50 - academic excellence so I think we should
64:55 - we're gonna do academically excellent
64:57 - first which makes sense it comes first
64:59 - in the tag line so that'll be what
65:01 - people see and that should hopefully
65:03 - give them some new information that
65:04 - maybe they didn't know alright because
65:06 - we want students to be able to feel like
65:08 - I can get a really good education here
65:10 - so that you know I can go out and get a
65:14 - job we never want the dilemma of
65:16 - somebody saying you know what I really
65:17 - do want to come here because of the
65:19 - faith part of it but I I don't know that
65:23 - I'll learn a lot there or maybe they
65:25 - aren't sure if they have you know their
65:27 - major or they're not sure if they'll be
65:29 - able to get a job when they graduate so
65:31 - we want to reassure people about that so
65:34 - I'm gonna try to split up the site into
65:37 - two main sections the About section at
65:41 - the bottom or I'm sorry it's at the top
65:44 - now I think we should move the About
65:45 - section to the bottom
65:52 - so right right now I don't know I don't
66:00 - see to be honest with you there's so
66:03 - much texting it's so small I'm not sure
66:05 - how much of it actually gets read right
66:07 - now so and it's not the focus here it
66:10 - seems like it's in between these two
66:12 - things that draw your eye this because
66:14 - it's just you know it's big the colors
66:19 - are there I don't I think it looks kind
66:21 - of odd
66:22 - so that draws your attention and then
66:23 - this is a picture all right with a
66:25 - call-to-action button here so I don't
66:29 - know that this is having any impact
66:31 - right now I don't think it'll be a
66:32 - problem and move this to the bottom all
66:36 - right so that's that's the idea so for
66:38 - now I'm gonna fill in the section names
66:40 - and then I'm gonna do my timer just went
66:44 - up but before I forget any of this to
66:47 - keep it all straight I'm just gonna fill
66:49 - in three section names right now and
66:51 - then I'm gonna check the time kind of
66:55 - see how we're doing and decide whether
66:56 - or not we're gonna do the third comodoro
66:57 - session okay here's our news section and
67:04 - I'm sorry I I know that the formatting
67:07 - right now has got to be just killing
67:10 - some of you every time I see that
67:13 - formatting like my heart hurts it's like
67:18 - it's terrible so I'm I'm definitely
67:22 - gonna fix that formatting and I'm gonna
67:24 - look up the whatever the shortcut is to
67:28 - format the before the next stream okay
67:36 - so let's go
67:42 - technically excellence
67:50 - excellent and this will be
68:20 - all right just make sure that look sorry
68:24 - that's right stuff okay that's what you
68:27 - want so we're gonna we're gonna cut this
68:30 - down so we're not one two basically for
68:37 - really four main sections this is going
68:40 - to be a somewhat narrow section but so
68:44 - not counting the hero section in this
68:47 - before main sections so I'm hoping to
68:51 - reduce the amount of scroll that needs
68:53 - to happen in this site because right now
68:55 - there's a lot of scrolling going on and
68:57 - I've gotten you know negative feedback
68:59 - for that I don't think anybody likes how
69:02 - much scrolling has to happen so I'm
69:07 - gonna try to cut that as much as
69:08 - possible but there's still there's still
69:11 - a lot of content so you know we can't
69:14 - completely cut you'll cut everything out
69:20 - all right let me I'm gonna set the five
69:25 - minute timer but this may end up being
69:27 - the last session so I want to just kind
69:32 - of see how many questions there are and
69:35 - and see what time it is
69:42 - I'm actually getting pretty hungry so
69:44 - right now I'm leaning towards not doing
69:46 - another session and instead eating
70:11 - all right so the question that I asked
70:17 - you Oh in the last five minute break was
70:20 - was from Reuben about whether you'd
70:25 - rather fight one hundred duck-sized
70:26 - horses or one horse esta so you all gave
70:31 - your answers let me read out some of
70:33 - these answers a huff hopefully we have
70:36 - some code related questions as well but
70:39 - James says a hundred duck-sized horses q
70:41 - master says one horse-sized duck sounds
70:43 - like less work if I have a spear or
70:45 - something
70:46 - one good head and done it's a good point
70:50 - black bat says my 50 Cal sidearm prefers
70:53 - one horse-sized duck that takes care of
70:57 - Thanksgiving supper - I didn't even
70:59 - think about that but that would be quite
71:01 - a bit of duck meat if you had a horse
71:07 - sized duck heights John Hansen says a
71:16 - lot of smaller struggles are always much
71:17 - easier to handle than one big one so 100
71:20 - duck sized horses okay
71:32 - James since a hundred duck-sized horses
71:34 - build up my confidence as I defeat them
71:36 - and give me better ideas to approach and
71:38 - strategize my fight I might come across
71:41 - an idea that will kill all hundred and a
71:43 - blow ok all right so that's it for me I
71:54 - think I'd rather go with the giant duck
71:58 - sized horse or I'm sorry horse sized
72:03 - duck that's added backwards because I
72:07 - don't know that I could really fight all
72:09 - those cute tiny little horses right that
72:12 - would be tough but it would be much
72:14 - easier mentally to fight this like giant
72:17 - monster of a duck right um anyway
72:24 - although I think that it would probably
72:26 - be more dangerous to be around that
72:28 - giant duck all right so now back to some
72:34 - code hopefully hopefully I didn't upset
72:37 - anybody by you know having entertaining
72:40 - that question there there's only what
72:43 - maybe like a minute or two of of time we
72:47 - took on that okay
72:55 - so Oh harsh it says react sixteen is
73:01 - coming out with the MIT license instead
73:04 - of the BSD three clause who's excited
73:07 - yeah so that's really interesting that
73:11 - that happen I know we had a question I
73:13 - think last week about someone asked me
73:15 - what I thought about the license and
73:18 - also what I thought about WordPress
73:21 - deciding not to go with react anymore
73:23 - because of the license so I've already
73:28 - given my thoughts on that I'm not going
73:29 - to repeat them
73:31 - but I'm I'm actually somewhat surprised
73:36 - that Facebook decided to change their
73:38 - license I didn't think that they would
73:42 - so so that's cool why I think that's
73:48 - that reassures a lot of people - that's
73:52 - cool
73:52 - for me I didn't really care one way or
73:55 - another for the license I didn't think
73:57 - it would affect my work that much at
73:59 - least from what I understood about it so
74:04 - but I like it
74:06 - I like that it happened because if the
74:11 - react community gets bigger it's only
74:12 - gonna benefit you know it's going to
74:15 - help all of us right there'll be more
74:16 - information out there more jobs for
74:19 - react developers so I think it'll be
74:23 - good
74:24 - it'll be good for the react community in
74:27 - general that the license changed and you
74:31 - know any any companies that were
74:34 - hesitant over it before you know maybe
74:36 - they won't be so hesitant now yeah so
74:40 - it's a good thing it was surprising but
74:42 - but good let's see okay cool Jon Hansen
74:50 - said it read more at the bottom is
74:51 - generally better so cool that was that's
74:54 - good a good call that we had this there
74:56 - at the bottom yeah I do agree I mean
75:00 - right now we can see it all in one go
75:02 - but on a smaller screen there'd be some
75:03 - scrolling so
75:05 - you know normally if the readmore is up
75:06 - here you see that first well you might
75:09 - not be sure whether or not you want to
75:11 - read more yet you haven't even seen
75:13 - what's there so I do agree as as you
75:16 - scroll you get a little taste of what's
75:19 - there then if you're interested yeah
75:21 - then you can read more so I don't know
75:24 - maybe you know maybe there is some data
75:26 - to show that you get more clicks on a
75:28 - read more at the top I don't I don't
75:30 - really know but just logically for me
75:33 - you know I can definitely understand if
75:35 - I was going through his site thinking
75:38 - it'd be more convenient to have the read
75:39 - more button at the bottom I would
75:41 - probably look for it at the bottom as
75:43 - well okay John boys says I think you
75:51 - typed position instead of postition
75:54 - instead of position so thanks for
75:56 - catching that
75:56 - I didn't look over at the live chat and
75:58 - see that that would have saved me a
75:59 - little bit of time trying to figure that
76:02 - out
76:03 - uh-hum let's see John Hanson says
76:07 - interesting section design and for that
76:10 - we're talking about this design so
76:14 - saying interesting section design open
76:16 - no borders you know color image grouping
76:20 - and easy to see button click I like it
76:23 - cool yeah yeah when I saw it I was just
76:26 - I I did I was really kind of impressed
76:31 - with with this the only the only thing I
76:33 - thought is man I'd really love to have a
76:35 - color palette that would work well with
76:37 - this kind of thing so I'm gonna try it
76:40 - usually what we do is stick with on
76:46 - light backgrounds one color for all
76:48 - buttons and then another color on dark
76:52 - backgrounds you usually we do that
76:54 - inverted button on the dark backgrounds
76:57 - but occasionally we will do a solid
76:59 - color so this would definitely be
77:02 - different than what we normally do but
77:04 - I'm interested in seeing if we took you
77:07 - know maybe three of the colors that
77:09 - aren't often used from the university
77:12 - color palette and use them like this you
77:15 - know what would it look like I mean this
77:16 - works especially well because they Eve
77:18 - match you know all these things so they
77:21 - have the icon the title of this so it
77:24 - works they're all so bright you know
77:27 - kind of playful colors and that's
77:28 - Google's thing people expect that so I'm
77:31 - not sure that it would translate well to
77:34 - Franciscans color palette but we'll see
77:40 - I'd like to give it a shot I'm not
77:42 - really hopeful that it'll work out but I
77:44 - it would be cool to give it give it a
77:46 - shot okay so Tony says looks like the
77:54 - formatting shortcut is Shift option F
77:56 - all right thank you let's try that out
78:03 - yes thank you so much I'm so happy now
78:10 - look at that so much nicer so much nicer
78:14 - - thank you again that's awesome
78:17 - so I I know we already went over this on
78:20 - a previous stream but I didn't remember
78:22 - so I'll repeat it again shift option F
78:28 - does the auto formatting in Visual
78:32 - Studio code okay and actually that's it
78:39 - for the live chat yeah so we might wrap
78:46 - this up unless anybody has any questions
78:48 - you can get in there in the next few
78:50 - seconds we're gonna wrap things up now I
78:54 - I appreciate you all watching especially
79:00 - at the earlier time with short notice so
79:03 - sorry again for the confusion on the
79:07 - time I'll do my best to double-check
79:10 - everything you know when I schedule the
79:13 - stream but anyway that's a good stream I
79:18 - feel a lot more confident about the
79:20 - design we have now or at least the plan
79:23 - for the design it's looking
79:30 - I mean it's looking really plain right
79:31 - now so it's not it's not great but I
79:33 - think we're gonna get somewhere where
79:34 - it'll be possible to at least show you
79:38 - know my boss something and get some
79:40 - feedback and and really start to
79:42 - fine-tune things this is sorry I'm Berto
79:52 - says back to pare if it's still going
79:56 - I'm buried so I'm not sure what you mean
79:58 - by that anyway let me know I know
80:04 - there's a delay so it might not get an
80:05 - answer before I in the stream but I'll
80:09 - probably be back tomorrow I am feeling a
80:12 - little bit better yesterday I wasn't
80:13 - feeling well
80:14 - I'm feeling a little bit better my
80:16 - throat is still pretty sore so I mean if
80:19 - I feel worse tomorrow there's a
80:20 - possibility I might not come into work
80:23 - or stream so I'm just I'm not not sure
80:27 - about it it's really tempting to stay
80:29 - home but I can't stream from home so
80:31 - that's one of the reasons why I came in
80:32 - today and staying home so once I got
80:38 - going this morning and actually got into
80:40 - work I did feel a little bit better so
80:50 - okay I'm Barrett this is Google's people
80:53 - plus AI whatever the R stands for oh
80:56 - okay that was streaming to alright I get
80:59 - it now I get it so anyway
81:01 - Umberto's said that google has something
81:04 - streaming about AI right now so saying
81:08 - we'll go back to that that's cool
81:10 - actually maybe I'll watch that while I
81:11 - eat my lunch if it's still going so
81:16 - thanks for that
81:17 - umberto alright so like I said be back
81:21 - probably be back tomorrow we'll see
81:23 - thanks for watching and yeah and thanks
81:29 - for getting us to over 200,000
81:31 - subscribers really really appreciate
81:34 - that that's awesome
81:36 - so until tomorrow have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jessie welcome to live coding with Jessie if you're watching this recording later because you were expecting the stream to be later on at my normal time 200 p.m. Eastern I'm very sorry I I intended to stream at 200 p.m. and I tweeted that I would be streaming at 200 p.m. and then about 5 minutes ago I realized that I had set the stream to go live at 11 a.m. Eastern time so I'm not even sure how many people are gonna be watching this live because it's it's so much earlier than normal and I told everybody the wrong time so apologies again but I thought I could have either canceled that stream or made it postponed it or I could have just put out on Twitter that hey I'm in a stream right now so I chose the latter because they're already about 4 or 5 people waiting for the stream when I found out so I didn't want to leave them hanging so I mean everybody I guess would have initially got the notification from YouTube for the right time so maybe that'll help it looks like I do have some people in here so awesome hey it's actually not bad when I do it at a different time sometimes there are people who just can't watch the stream at my normal time so now maybe we'll have some new faces who watch the recordings but don't get to participate live okay so I'm I wasn't planning on working on this yet I was gonna work on some other stuff but we're gonna work more on this as you can see I've done pretty much nothing this still looks kind of broken like we left it on Friday so didn't work on pretty much anything yesterday I wasn't feeling well just stayed home well I should say that I worked on my Udacity project so I finally got that to the point where I was confident to turn it in so I don't have it ready to show you today so sometime this week maybe oh I'll show you all I don't have it up and running anywhere but I can just have it running locally and just show it to everybody let's see what else did I want to say oh okay so I don't know I'm sure you all saw that I'm sure a lot of you saw that we got so we as in free code camps YouTube channel got a silver play button from YouTube which is really cool so Quincy made a video and posted it last night and so check that out if you don't know what that is when a YouTube channel gets to a hundred thousand subscribers they get this silver play button you know framed and it's really cool so we're actually over two hundred thousand subscribers now but it's still really cool that we got that so I'm excited and also quits Quincy thanked all the YouTube people and so my name was in there too and I was just that was really cool I was I'm still like I'm still very appreciative that for this opportunity to to contribute to free code camp so anyway and I'm glad that I could help in some way and you know reaching the subscriber count that we have now okay let me let me get started yes so we got we got a decent amount of viewers right now so let's go ahead and get started so I said hello what's up take my so so I think somebody wants me to say their name on youtube so Abdul Wahab I think that's it Abdul Wahab sorry you all know I try really hard to pronounce names correctly so if I don't pronounce your name correctly let me know all right so have a lot of people saying congratulations in the live chat thank you so much I mean really it's you all that that did that right I mean you you're the ones that subscribe so yeah it's it's amazing I don't know what to think that anyway I'm gonna get to coding but I'm just really it's just really cool let's see all right so let me at least tell you what I've done I've done a lot of prep work to get ready to do this so I was just really having trouble with this design in terms of just not there's a lot of content on the page so it's it's really difficult because my design style is usually like very minimal so I was having a lot of trouble figuring out like where where everything was going to go how I could keep a lot of the content and not have it be cluttered so usually when I'm at the beginning stages of design and I get stuck I just look for inspiration so I looked at a lot of material design sites a lot of you know the Google Sites and I got some really good ideas to incorporate at least I think they look they're pretty good at least the way they were executed on the sites that I saw so I think it's gonna work out I have a much more clear plan now so let's get let's get to it okay let's build out this this the frame for all the sections first right so I know about how many sections are gonna be so I think it would be better visually to just have all those sections with some headers in there and then we can start putting things in and that'll maybe help a little bit to get what's in my head conveyed to you all as quickly as possible that's always tough I usually have but you know a vision in my head of what it's going to look like but trying to convey that to other people is not always easy my my drawing skills are not great so I try to sketch it out but it never looks the same okay so let's see we just need some we need some sections and actually we're gonna we're gonna take out a lot of this right so I I'm done with the with the Carousel idea or even the accordion so I have a different idea for this section and then for our news and events section so at first for this section we're just gonna have a few cards across and if we need to if we really want to have more than a few cards we could potentially just have a large scroller all right so that it'll it'll just shift across so we'll probably build that I don't know I'm thinking that we'll just build that from scratch maybe we use what's with materialise we'll see I'm undecided still it'll be the faster way to do it let me start my timer before I forget so if you are new you haven't seen this before I do 25 minute sessions of code and then in between I do fiveminute sessions of question and answer and then at the end I finish out and I'll answer any of the questions that are in the live chat so I always do at least two Pomodoro sessions of 25 minutes I'm definitely going to do two today and then we'll see how things go all right so let's just get some basics let's see what name I gave this class so okay so this is all in a container right now I don't want to make everything in a container I think what we'll end up doing is having sections in those sections that we want to be contained so have this space on the sides here we'll then put the container inside the section but I would like to have you know as we're doing here full width sections so so like this so right now I guess it's okay if I do these in rows and one way I do do them in sections so section there we go oops can I do that no all right so if you confuse this to what I was just going right there Visual Studio code comes with Emmet Emmet is a shorthand oops a way to kind of do shorthand and then have it automatically turn it into HTML so I'm I'm learning how to do it so far it's a really cool feature you can see how easy that was and so right now I'm just gonna put in I'm just gonna put in the text it just says column just so that there's something we can see with this structure not every section is going to have the same structure but it's going to be you know this will be kind of a nice base structure that we can work off of is a section with two columns we're gonna have yeah so some of the sections we will want that container in as well but I'm not gonna put that in there right now we'll also want see let's put a header in here as well h2 section there we go alright so this will give us an idea right now I'm thinking we'll probably have another I'm gonna start with with section but maybe like five more sections and then see how that looks okay great here's the section for now I think I'm gonna take out this banner or at least comment out the banner let's just comment it out for now okay and let's take out I didn't want to put a different image in here I just keep forgetting let's take out these for a least change it up I'm gonna go back to what we had originally which was just a card like this just three of them I I wonder I think I'm gonna try to put in the actual texts that are in some of these now on the main site that the live version of this site and see how it looks if we can get away with making the cards a little bit smaller we might be able to go with four across on a large screen so I think I think that would work out so this is what we want and all right so let's go inside this row put two more of these in oh man what was the there was a hot key there was a hot key for formatting things automatically what was it I don't remember what it was um I'll have to look back at the last video whenever I I learned what the hot key was and then fixed that formatting because right now that's terrible all right this is make sure you did that right okay great let's grab grab some of the actual text man are these is this a text it's just I think that's part of the image is it let's see I'm gonna inspect that to see if that's all just an image enough how do we have five okay okay so that's actual sex oh wow all right okay so each each line is actually in its own in its own div interesting okay so I guess I'll just type this out it seems like that'll be the easiest thing to do so I'm gonna move this over to my other screen so that I can type it easily all right I guess some answers to the Auto formatting but I have have different answers control Kennedy all right let's try this whoa okay the control k/d did not work that did not work let's try this over wish okay so for not working thanks for the advice though I let's see oh I'll figure it out I can always go back and check the last stream okay I don't know if you all noticed in the last stream but several of my coworkers were peeking in the door and doing silly things so I didn't realize how many of them were doing it and so they told me after the stream and then I went through and and saw it so I guess that'll be some nice Easter eggs to look for now okay so I'm not sure if we even want to have the card title there's not really anything now on the card that that I think would be good for the title I mean unless let's try this let's try to put the students name where the title is and then include their quote and then just have a read more link we'll see how that looks all right so Shannon and I want to put this in quotation marks so it's clear that it's a quote this automatically type server and this instead of serve okay that was good and then let's see how it looks okay yeah that's that's a really small amount of text let's try to get away with doing four cards then and so I could definitely I could see a few benefits to doing four cards I think five would be pushing it but four cards would allow us to use much smaller images as long as we keep it consistent and you know potentially even on a small screen we could drop down to two columns so that we would never have anything like as big as that right and then we'd be able to display more you know right away without having to click in one way or another and I'm open I mean I'm I think I'm gonna suggest that we just we don't have five stories like we have now I think we should just have three or four stories and then if we want to change them out more frequently that's totally fine but I don't know when it comes to like carousels like this the statistics at least that I've read show that you know barely anybody ever gets to the fifth one the percentage drops significantly after the first and you know after the second one so most users don't even get to this point so I think it would be better to just have a few visible immediately and what the user is much more likely to actually look at that and read that I definitely want to set it up so that these are always the same same height so probably won't work on that today I know we've done things like that in previous projects so I may not do it on the stream we'll just mostly we're where we get with it okay so let's let me add one more card she's gonna add one more card here and then let me change these so what we want is this to be 3 and then medium can be dropped to 4 that's gonna look weird I think we don't want that let's go with medium 3 small 6 ok so on small screens each card each column is going to take up 6 of their 12 columns so 6 of those are going to be taken up by the first column second column left 6 and then over here each one's gonna take up 3 so we'll show you what that looks like ok so you see as we get smaller at some point it goes to two okay and that's not bad I mean I don't like how long these cards are but I'm I'm okay with this this isn't really you know this isn't too bad and for right now I'm sticking with the column classes that are built in to materialise but if we really want to have more control over things we could always you know set our own breakpoints do some different things with that occasionally you know I've had to do that okay so I'm gonna leave this like this for now it gives a general idea of what this could look like and it's something that I could show my boss to show other people to just get get them thinking so normally the process goes I consult with my boss or whoever is has the information for the project just kind of talk about some things sometimes I'll scan things out get some immediate feedback then I go to work and actually build something out just usually with a lot of you know content like this right you know obviously this is not ready to go get alive but it gives you know a better visual you know something you can actually interact with then I go back to my boss or whoever and get some more feedback and it will change so what we're doing now is probably not going to be the final version of this but we just want to kind of get our ideas out you know actually kind of build out not completely but just kind of roughly all right so for the news section which will be our next section I think I may have some sections that are banners in between just to break up all the white but I'm not going to do that right now we'll get everything on here see how it looks and then see if we need that I also have another I have another idea that I might put into place I've noticed on some of Google's sites that they they don't have the cards automatically visible they're only visible when you hover over them let me show you an example and I want to see what you all think about that it's a little bit different for me I'm not I'm not really used to it but I'm not I'm not opposed to it it's interesting so here we go fine let me bring this over okay so check this out so this first this is the design Google and so you hover over this and now it becomes a card and the entire thing is clickable down here it's that it's the same is it anything I thought it was for this I guess not here it is okay so for these ones it's the same thing it's clickable now here's the the advantage of this I think this is really cool so notice that these are not the same heights but it's not obvious that they're not the same height right away but if you hover over them you could definitely tell but since they're never both visible at the same time you don't immediately get that idea that like wow these are really off right so I love that because one of the one of the big issues always when I'm doing things with cards is you know getting them all to be the same the same height and sometimes I don't have control over the content I advised that we you know try to have uniform content and try to have as little text content as possible and but I don't always have control over that so for instance here if one of these were large this card I could get the card to be the same height but there'd still be lots of white space inside it doesn't seem like it's not obviously you know so different when the white space is inside but it's still a little bit weird sometimes so I'm thinking about going with something like this I don't think this is built into materializes something we'd have to do on our own don't think it would be that difficult though so anyway let me know what you think so I'm not gonna look at the live chat right now but when the timer goes off when we do our our first five minutes the first part of that first thing I'm going to look at is that and see what you all think so for now I'm just gonna do the cards like normal but we may be switching to that that's that's definitely going to be a different it's going to be different than anything else we've done so so I'm okay with doing it because I I think there are there are a lot of benefits I think it gives us a lot more freedom doing it like this so we'll see but for the newsfeed I liked how it was done here so not every piece of news has to have an image right you we have here and we may not do it exactly like this we have one main piece of news that does have an image and then the rest of them we just have the the titles and you know just a little snippet so I like that you know we have the more news up here so I think we're going to go with something like this the news right now on the site we have so we do have images but we don't these images aren't always I think the best right so certainly some stories will have images that could be used but I don't think every story necessarily needs an image with it right I mean this if we're going to use an image it should add to the understanding of what's happening all right it should draw you know draw your eye like recive right now I can't even read this stuff down here it's hard to read this and I'm pretty close to my screen right now so now right if we add you know maybe a really wellknown person like like father Scanlon really wellknown at this university so a picture of father Scanlon would definitely be appropriate to have for a news story but logos I don't know so I like the idea that in this setup we could have something with an image and things without an image and it looks fine earlier the way I was going to do it I don't know that it would look it would look good we would be forced to always have an image and a certain and image with certain dimensions for every story so let me check my time before I try to implement this okay we got about three and a half minutes so let's try to do as much as we can here it looks like basically we'll have mm I mean we're definitely gonna have two columns see we're gonna want these columns to be inside a container okay so we're already set up for two calls we just need to add the container first and then let's make I keep thinking in terms of react component I almost said we're gonna make a component for this but we we can't we're not not using react so which we're just gonna write the markup for this for you know for something like this I'm not gonna try to match this exactly I actually really don't like doing that I feel weird copying someone's design exactly I don't mind taking some inspiration from it you know the general concept of having stories with and without images but you know I don't want to try to copy fonts spacing everything so we're gonna try to adapt it and kind of make it our own let's see so we have section right all right so this is this I think it's the section that we want you start getting names on these sections it'll be a lot easier and we can potentially break these out into components if we need to I think I mentioned that before if this component starts getting huge then probably be better for organization to break it out all right so you say news and we got to put this in a container right so what we can do then is probably the easiest way to do this I think is to make the container just add the class container on this section in previous projects I've added a container inside the section but I think maybe I had a good reason for that and I forget but I think it's unnecessary to have an extra div just to add this extra class so we're gonna try it like this I think it should be fine just to test it let's make sure this should there we go so now this does have margins on the side and let's thank God I want to quit having to load that image every single time so I'm gonna comment it out for now the big hero image I just I feel bad like continuously hitting the unsplash was unsplash thought I T sermons so my timer is up now anyway let me find that CSS file let's take that okay all right so let me go to the live chat now and then we'll we'll fill this in my my timer it's hidden there we go all right okay okay so so so Tony says I upload the Google design cards okay cool so we got one vote for the um I'm assuming you mean like this this how we how they do it here John says same hiding cards is easy with Flex CSS attribute stretch or in grid it's even easier now I know great I will yeah I know there are some ways that I have used that make the cards getting the same height in the card it's a lot easier let's see alright so that seems like it was it looks like that's that's all for the opinions about the card design so I'm going to scroll up and try to see if there are any questions Harshit says congratulations your silver play button and may free code can't progress it so it reaches more than a million subs that would be cool did they give you a gold button at a million subs I'm not sure I would have this I would imagine the next step would be gold button right that would be really cool to get a million okay Brando asked about the IDE it's it's Visual Studio code so I don't know if I would call that an IDE but that's the code editor that I'm using today okay cool no D says it's been a while because the streams are always late but glad to see it today so that's awesome I'm I'm really glad that you get to see the stream now so I like I said I know there are people that watch the the videos that don't get to stream because of the time so cool I'm glad you can gladly ask it says am i late yeah I'm I'm actually early so you are you're a little bit late maybe about a half hour I started that about a half hour ago so but it's it's my fault I started way earlier than normal without very much notice to everyone okay so nobody asks if I write unit tests when coding unfortunately I don't write tests when coding so I did have on the last project Kevin who's frequently in the in the live chat and contributes on github set up some some testing stuff and I did end up going through and editing a lot of the the tests that he set up and was learning how to do that that was what do you say it was end end testing so I would like to be able to do tests I just am not really I don't know enough about it right now I'd like to find some good training materials on testing right now I have no time to do anything else until my nano degree is finished so it'll probably happen is I'll finish my nano degree by the end of October then I'll probably have to work on my talk for November then after that I'll probably have time to learn something new in that case I think testing should be the next thing I learned we'll see unless something else comes up anyway so I really do want to do testing it's just not something that I've that I've learned all right we got one question at the end that I just have to read so says which would you rather fight this is Ruben says which would you rather fight one hundred ducksized horses or one horsesized duck is that and this is so weird cuz I just I just saw somebody else just ask this question my cousin's husband asked this question and she posted it on Facebook so where is this question from I feel like I'm missing some reference but anyway that's a good question so I'm not gonna give my answer yet if you'd like to answer in the live chat let me know and then on the next 5minute break I'll read out the answers and I'll give my answer I would hate to influence you all on such an important matter so what would you rather fight a hundred ducksized horses or one horsesized duck that sounds like a good question for my kids I gotta remember to ask him later on they'll probably my oldest son Rafael will probably just like try to think it out for you know four hours and he'll be trying to come up well maybe if you did this all right so okay cool let's build this now where to go there we go I'm like I'm gonna separate these sections out with some spaces just I can keep it straight I normally would not put this many spaces between things but I don't want to have to keep searching for it okay alright so in this section we'll have and we want to give this hh4 maybe so let's give it give it a div forgot forgot to do that I'm gonna force myself to do this I remember so it'll actually let me let me put in some of the actual news that we have and let's put this paragraph in here and then I also want to put in let's put in an image when you grab this source over here wow that's really cool that it automatically puts the source and the all text and okay actually the title is the link so I'm not worried about that right now but this will end up being a link let's see what that looks like and then I'm just gonna copy this now and paste it here and then let's remove this whoops I'm sorry I meant to remove the image and then we'll copy it a few times I see that gives us okay not not too bad at first so what we want to do I actually really like the idea of putting the date right because right now our stories don't have the date I mean that gives us the advantage of let's say we don't update our stories very often it's not obvious that they're not updated but I don't know I think I think I'd like to have the date in there I guess the problem is right now if we're not pulling the date in I'm not sure how we would pull the date in because I have no idea how to so like this would be the equip setting this up in Ektron which is the content management system that this site uses would be I don't know what it's called an extra on but like in WordPress terms it would be a custom post type so I don't know how to make a custom post type in Extron or to get data from a post siphon Ektron so I'll have to learn a lot more before that can happen so for now I'm gonna leave off the dates because I know for sure we can grab these pieces of data because I can just look and see how we're doing it now if I do figure out how to grab the date great I'll grab the date otherwise I'm just I'm not gonna worry about it I'm definitely not gonna worry about it now we're just trying it you know show something on the page all right so I'm just I want to clean this up a little bit I don't want to spend you know a ton of time on it but I think there's a few things that we could do so for now I think these these titles are way too big so we need to drop those down we definitely need to get rid of that character up I'm not worried about it right now but at some point we need to and then the image I'm not sure what we can do about so I mean ideally we would have an image that took up you know the full full space here but without editing this image I don't see how that's gonna happen so we'll just leave it all right so let's drop these down what are the age for is now let's try to drop them down this we can see what age oops what age five looks like okay I think that's all multiple cursors is so useful okay all right that's much better that's the size that I was initially thinking of okay great so that's good I would probably I mean this is pretty obvious that the title goes with this text but you know maybe we could do something add a little bit more space here and tighten this up here but for now that gives the general idea the only other thing we want to have here is you know like a read more I guess we could put it over here the only other place that would make sense is to have something down here that said read more I'm actually not sure that we even have that right now okay so we do have a more link right now and it is at the bottom I don't know why I'm thinking so much about whether to put it at the top of the bottom I think I'm gonna put it at the bottom honestly and the only reason why I'm gonna put at the bottom is as I said I don't like to copy people's designs exactly and so we are leaving out some things but you know putting putting this at the top I'm if there's something that I can try to not copy that's kind of not really important I can put that down here so I know it's a small thing but I'm just gonna put it down here for now we'll see how how it looks all right so let's get section yeah you know the bottom of this section let's put in and for now I don't want it to go anywhere okay so we're gonna have to style this a bit right so I wanted over on this side some suspect that and this might actually be pretty simple well somewhat right so I I do want it on this side on a large screen but on a small screen you probably won't look right on that side so for now I'm not gonna worry about that but I would probably want it aligned this way on a small screen below below these so maybe we can just see I don't want to do it everywhere there we go okay so if you can see what I did there so initially this was all the way over here because when you use positionabsolute on an element it is absolute in relation to the parent element that has a position of relative so if it's immediate parent element which in this case was this section then if the media parent element is not position relative it goes up to the next one so it went up to a probably this div may be further up I mean obviously like the entire window could be potentially you know it could go up to there if nothing has positioned relative so for right now it shouldn't affect anything on the page that I've made this position relative but you notice as soon as I made this parent div have a position of relative this went right back into place and now it is aligned zero pixels from the right side of that div so for now this is okay probably would not have it be zero pixels I it might look better if it was shifted in a little bit but I'm okay with it for now but that's kind of a really tricky thing with CSS positioning so if you're having trouble with absolute positioning remember relative it probably took me years before I finally remembered that without having to look it up okay so let me put I don't know if I want to make every section positionrelative so I'm just gonna put it in line for this one react is ruined me in terms of inline Styles I never did it before wait what why is he giving me a green underline don't use empty one style that it these wispy styles was wrong with me why don't I remember that yet okay for this one we actually have a unique class so we can put that in the CSS I don't know what I called it now more link okay what can we do positionabsolute and right zero okay let's try that out see I knew it was what did I do wrong yeah CEOs position I just can't spell it's my problem there we go okay a little longer than it should have taken but now it not works alright so cool so that's my my idea for the new section for the events section I'm not gonna put them in right now because I want to check there's there's been like some discussion of doing events differently so there may be an API that I can tap into to pull an events so I'd like to get a little bit more information before I put any effort into how I'm going to display events because I don't know that I think that whatever I do is likely to change based on what's decided about how we're handling events alright so next section well let me check my time all right seven minutes cool for the next section let me show you some of what my inspiration is for these sections where do I put my okay so the Google developers sites at developers.google.com also as you know material design in use here but they have so obviously you know these are normal cards you know we're going to be using those but they have these sections here where it's some some visual things so probably be an image in our case and then they just have some information and a button now acts I have done this before on several different sites so it's not something completely new to me but I like how so when I've done it before this has been very large so like a big image complete sections lots of padding but what's unique in terms of at least what I've seen is how tight this is right so this seems as if it's one section and these are just a part of that one section I really like that and I've never done that before I think this will be good for what we need to do because you know if you remember on that main site we just have so much information in each section so we kind of need a way to break that up since we're not going to use these columns you know for instance a section like this I mean academics could be the main title here but it's like what do we do with all this information so I think we could incorporate some of this and split it up so that it looks something more like this you know a lot of space but still has information still has the name links I'm just gonna pick some of this out of here to put here just as an example just to show my show my boss what could happen and then he can start thinking about okay what information is the most important in this section what information can we cut out what do we have to keep and then now that he knows the framework of how it would fit in there it'll be much easier for him to say all right this is this is what we're gonna put in here right so that's not really it's not really up to me it's not really what I like to do so I'm not I'm not gonna try to do it I'm just gonna worry about design honestly it doesn't even matter what I put in here you know anything as long any placeholder will work so I'm gonna use kind of this idea for some of the sections and it will be interspersed I think with sections that'll be you know more like just cards with information so you know for instance something like this could end up being more like you know a section with with columns so we could include if we want some more some more videos to be honest with you I don't even I'm not sure about it keeping these I really need to do some some click tracking and see how many people you know watch these because that's the section that could take up a lot of space so if it's not useful to the people visiting the site then we may as well you know just take it out of there yeah so I think each of these sections would work like that my other thought I think I'll just put it in this first design is that we don't need to have so many sections so academics and admissions I think I think we could place them together so basically our tagline is academically excellent passionately Catholic I think those should be the sections that we have because those are the things we want to emphasize to our potential students so the draw of Franciscan University it's in a niche market and the niche market is people who are who are Catholics who really want so the you know teenagers who really want to you know deepen their knowledge of Catholicism alright because this school is known for being really good at teaching that it graduates the most theology majors out of any school in the country so that's where you know we want to have such a passionate Catholic but what we want to also do is is emphasize academically excellent because our reputation in terms of being good at teaching Catholicism is established right it's established and generally it's not it's it's it's not usually questioned among our target audience but what we need to establish is our academic excellence so I think we should we're gonna do academically excellent first which makes sense it comes first in the tag line so that'll be what people see and that should hopefully give them some new information that maybe they didn't know alright because we want students to be able to feel like I can get a really good education here so that you know I can go out and get a job we never want the dilemma of somebody saying you know what I really do want to come here because of the faith part of it but I I don't know that I'll learn a lot there or maybe they aren't sure if they have you know their major or they're not sure if they'll be able to get a job when they graduate so we want to reassure people about that so I'm gonna try to split up the site into two main sections the About section at the bottom or I'm sorry it's at the top now I think we should move the About section to the bottom so right right now I don't know I don't see to be honest with you there's so much texting it's so small I'm not sure how much of it actually gets read right now so and it's not the focus here it seems like it's in between these two things that draw your eye this because it's just you know it's big the colors are there I don't I think it looks kind of odd so that draws your attention and then this is a picture all right with a calltoaction button here so I don't know that this is having any impact right now I don't think it'll be a problem and move this to the bottom all right so that's that's the idea so for now I'm gonna fill in the section names and then I'm gonna do my timer just went up but before I forget any of this to keep it all straight I'm just gonna fill in three section names right now and then I'm gonna check the time kind of see how we're doing and decide whether or not we're gonna do the third comodoro session okay here's our news section and I'm sorry I I know that the formatting right now has got to be just killing some of you every time I see that formatting like my heart hurts it's like it's terrible so I'm I'm definitely gonna fix that formatting and I'm gonna look up the whatever the shortcut is to format the before the next stream okay so let's go technically excellence excellent and this will be all right just make sure that look sorry that's right stuff okay that's what you want so we're gonna we're gonna cut this down so we're not one two basically for really four main sections this is going to be a somewhat narrow section but so not counting the hero section in this before main sections so I'm hoping to reduce the amount of scroll that needs to happen in this site because right now there's a lot of scrolling going on and I've gotten you know negative feedback for that I don't think anybody likes how much scrolling has to happen so I'm gonna try to cut that as much as possible but there's still there's still a lot of content so you know we can't completely cut you'll cut everything out all right let me I'm gonna set the five minute timer but this may end up being the last session so I want to just kind of see how many questions there are and and see what time it is I'm actually getting pretty hungry so right now I'm leaning towards not doing another session and instead eating all right so the question that I asked you Oh in the last five minute break was was from Reuben about whether you'd rather fight one hundred ducksized horses or one horse esta so you all gave your answers let me read out some of these answers a huff hopefully we have some code related questions as well but James says a hundred ducksized horses q master says one horsesized duck sounds like less work if I have a spear or something one good head and done it's a good point black bat says my 50 Cal sidearm prefers one horsesized duck that takes care of Thanksgiving supper I didn't even think about that but that would be quite a bit of duck meat if you had a horse sized duck heights John Hansen says a lot of smaller struggles are always much easier to handle than one big one so 100 duck sized horses okay James since a hundred ducksized horses build up my confidence as I defeat them and give me better ideas to approach and strategize my fight I might come across an idea that will kill all hundred and a blow ok all right so that's it for me I think I'd rather go with the giant duck sized horse or I'm sorry horse sized duck that's added backwards because I don't know that I could really fight all those cute tiny little horses right that would be tough but it would be much easier mentally to fight this like giant monster of a duck right um anyway although I think that it would probably be more dangerous to be around that giant duck all right so now back to some code hopefully hopefully I didn't upset anybody by you know having entertaining that question there there's only what maybe like a minute or two of of time we took on that okay so Oh harsh it says react sixteen is coming out with the MIT license instead of the BSD three clause who's excited yeah so that's really interesting that that happen I know we had a question I think last week about someone asked me what I thought about the license and also what I thought about WordPress deciding not to go with react anymore because of the license so I've already given my thoughts on that I'm not going to repeat them but I'm I'm actually somewhat surprised that Facebook decided to change their license I didn't think that they would so so that's cool why I think that's that reassures a lot of people that's cool for me I didn't really care one way or another for the license I didn't think it would affect my work that much at least from what I understood about it so but I like it I like that it happened because if the react community gets bigger it's only gonna benefit you know it's going to help all of us right there'll be more information out there more jobs for react developers so I think it'll be good it'll be good for the react community in general that the license changed and you know any any companies that were hesitant over it before you know maybe they won't be so hesitant now yeah so it's a good thing it was surprising but but good let's see okay cool Jon Hansen said it read more at the bottom is generally better so cool that was that's good a good call that we had this there at the bottom yeah I do agree I mean right now we can see it all in one go but on a smaller screen there'd be some scrolling so you know normally if the readmore is up here you see that first well you might not be sure whether or not you want to read more yet you haven't even seen what's there so I do agree as as you scroll you get a little taste of what's there then if you're interested yeah then you can read more so I don't know maybe you know maybe there is some data to show that you get more clicks on a read more at the top I don't I don't really know but just logically for me you know I can definitely understand if I was going through his site thinking it'd be more convenient to have the read more button at the bottom I would probably look for it at the bottom as well okay John boys says I think you typed position instead of postition instead of position so thanks for catching that I didn't look over at the live chat and see that that would have saved me a little bit of time trying to figure that out uhhum let's see John Hanson says interesting section design and for that we're talking about this design so saying interesting section design open no borders you know color image grouping and easy to see button click I like it cool yeah yeah when I saw it I was just I I did I was really kind of impressed with with this the only the only thing I thought is man I'd really love to have a color palette that would work well with this kind of thing so I'm gonna try it usually what we do is stick with on light backgrounds one color for all buttons and then another color on dark backgrounds you usually we do that inverted button on the dark backgrounds but occasionally we will do a solid color so this would definitely be different than what we normally do but I'm interested in seeing if we took you know maybe three of the colors that aren't often used from the university color palette and use them like this you know what would it look like I mean this works especially well because they Eve match you know all these things so they have the icon the title of this so it works they're all so bright you know kind of playful colors and that's Google's thing people expect that so I'm not sure that it would translate well to Franciscans color palette but we'll see I'd like to give it a shot I'm not really hopeful that it'll work out but I it would be cool to give it give it a shot okay so Tony says looks like the formatting shortcut is Shift option F all right thank you let's try that out yes thank you so much I'm so happy now look at that so much nicer so much nicer thank you again that's awesome so I I know we already went over this on a previous stream but I didn't remember so I'll repeat it again shift option F does the auto formatting in Visual Studio code okay and actually that's it for the live chat yeah so we might wrap this up unless anybody has any questions you can get in there in the next few seconds we're gonna wrap things up now I I appreciate you all watching especially at the earlier time with short notice so sorry again for the confusion on the time I'll do my best to doublecheck everything you know when I schedule the stream but anyway that's a good stream I feel a lot more confident about the design we have now or at least the plan for the design it's looking I mean it's looking really plain right now so it's not it's not great but I think we're gonna get somewhere where it'll be possible to at least show you know my boss something and get some feedback and and really start to finetune things this is sorry I'm Berto says back to pare if it's still going I'm buried so I'm not sure what you mean by that anyway let me know I know there's a delay so it might not get an answer before I in the stream but I'll probably be back tomorrow I am feeling a little bit better yesterday I wasn't feeling well I'm feeling a little bit better my throat is still pretty sore so I mean if I feel worse tomorrow there's a possibility I might not come into work or stream so I'm just I'm not not sure about it it's really tempting to stay home but I can't stream from home so that's one of the reasons why I came in today and staying home so once I got going this morning and actually got into work I did feel a little bit better so okay I'm Barrett this is Google's people plus AI whatever the R stands for oh okay that was streaming to alright I get it now I get it so anyway Umberto's said that google has something streaming about AI right now so saying we'll go back to that that's cool actually maybe I'll watch that while I eat my lunch if it's still going so thanks for that umberto alright so like I said be back probably be back tomorrow we'll see thanks for watching and yeah and thanks for getting us to over 200,000 subscribers really really appreciate that that's awesome so until tomorrow have a great day
