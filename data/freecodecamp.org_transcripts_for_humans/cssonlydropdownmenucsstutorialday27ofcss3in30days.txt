00:00 - hey everybody what's up welcome back to
00:01 - css3 in 30 days today is day number 20.
00:05 - what was it seven we're gonna be
00:07 - building a drop down menu but first i'm
00:09 - gonna be making some more modifications
00:11 - to my silly looking microphone here a
00:13 - student of mine actually suggested that
00:16 - i this has nothing to do with css by the
00:18 - way he said in the box it comes with a
00:21 - large pop filter as well as this small
00:23 - one i think i'm going to try out the big
00:25 - pop filters so give me one moment how do
00:27 - you take this off
00:29 - whoa
00:32 - that is so silly
00:38 - thanks student for suggesting this to me
00:40 - now i look even more
00:42 - foolish oh maybe it's cool back to
00:45 - coding here we go we're going to be
00:47 - making a css only drop down menu this is
00:49 - a super simple lesson
00:51 - and all we're going to be doing is
00:52 - building this simple little drop down so
00:54 - i got a button here that says drop down
00:56 - when i hover over it bam we just got
00:58 - three drop down items normally you'd
01:00 - build this uh you know in javascript
01:03 - jquery and also css
01:06 - but i wanted to show you a really simple
01:07 - and lightweight version of just creating
01:10 - a simple
01:11 - css3 drop down so up here in our sandbox
01:14 - we've got just a simple button right
01:16 - here and then three links so that if
01:19 - none of the styles are working then at
01:21 - least the links are visible which is
01:23 - important for accessibility
01:24 - reasons uh now let's go over to our code
01:27 - editor and open up the 27 drop down menu
01:30 - folder folder folder is what it's called
01:34 - go ahead and download that open it up in
01:36 - your favorite code editor
01:38 - and open up the index and sandbox.css as
01:41 - always final.css is there for your
01:42 - reference to make sure uh that you're on
01:45 - track and if you have any issues you can
01:46 - always refer to that so here we go in
01:48 - the index just to quickly show you the
01:50 - markup right here in the sandbox we've
01:53 - got a div with the class of drop down a
01:55 - button within that
01:57 - div with the class of drop down menu and
01:58 - then three links simple
02:00 - simple sally
02:02 - super simple sam
02:04 - super simple sally and sam
02:06 - sat on super simple sally and sam sat on
02:09 - the seawall
02:10 - super simple sally sam sat in the
02:12 - sandbox there we go open the sandbox
02:17 - and now what we're going to do is we're
02:18 - just going to give it so we're going to
02:20 - say drop down and we're going to go
02:22 - position relative
02:25 - and
02:26 - let's go display inline block it's going
02:29 - to be important
02:30 - and z index let's
02:33 - do 10.
02:35 - i always just use random numbers with
02:36 - that index i have no rhyme or reason to
02:39 - how i use z index
02:42 - all i know is that if i have if i want
02:44 - one element in front of the other or
02:46 - make sure it's in front of everything
02:47 - i'll put a really high number so
02:49 - there's your professional strategy right
02:52 - there
02:53 - okay
02:54 - now we want to do is we're going to say
02:56 - drop down
02:57 - double underscore hover what i'm
02:59 - selecting there is simply the button
03:02 - it has the class of drop down hover
03:04 - display inline block as well i want to
03:08 - give this a padding of 10 pixels so
03:10 - we're just making the button look a
03:11 - little bit nicer here
03:13 - um my fingers are typing a little slower
03:16 - and clunkier than usual it's a little
03:18 - chilly down here in the basement i mean
03:19 - in my super high-end premium studio up
03:22 - in the skyscraper background color
03:25 - background
03:26 - we're going to go
03:28 - 323 b40 kind of reminds me of ub40 the
03:33 - popular british reiki band ooh baby i
03:36 - love your way
03:38 - everyday
03:40 - i wanna tell you i love your way
03:43 - every day yeah
03:46 - color white i'm gonna say cursor pointer
03:50 - save it let's check it out
03:52 - okay so we've got a button here looking
03:55 - a little bit better but i want that
03:58 - uh want that border gone buttons have
04:00 - weird borders by default in browsers so
04:01 - i'm going to say button
04:03 - no border
04:05 - none
04:06 - check it out yeah that's much better
04:09 - cool
04:11 - okay so now what we're going to do we're
04:12 - going to start zipping through this a
04:13 - bit more i've been spending a lot of
04:14 - time making really high quality jokes so
04:17 - let's get back to coding drop down hover
04:20 - hover that's interesting
04:22 - background we're gonna say two two two
04:25 - so a little bit of a dark gray
04:27 - and i'm going to also select the drop
04:31 - down
04:32 - double underscore menu
04:34 - and what we're going to do here is we're
04:36 - going to say position
04:37 - absolute
04:39 - we're going to go display none so this
04:40 - is the menu itself that's that div at
04:43 - the class of drop down under double
04:45 - underscore menu as a sibling to the
04:46 - button
04:48 - so display none by default top 100
04:52 - left zero uh maybe what i should do is
04:55 - actually not display none for now so you
04:57 - can actually see it so i'm going to just
04:58 - comment that out
04:59 - and
05:00 - i'm going to show you what's going on
05:02 - over here so this is starting to take
05:04 - shape
05:05 - so top 100 let me just take that out to
05:08 - show you what happens okay nothing so
05:10 - far
05:11 - makes it seem like this isn't necessary
05:14 - top 100
05:15 - left zero
05:18 - min width we're going to give it a 200
05:20 - pixel min width
05:21 - background uh white as well
05:25 - and
05:26 - we're gonna say
05:29 - baby nope not that background color
05:32 - three two three
05:34 - ub4 no b40 box shadow
05:37 - just giggly today that's all
05:40 - zero three pixel two pixel and then rgba
05:44 - zero zero zero zero point three so a
05:47 - little bit transparent
05:49 - okay check it out so far
05:51 - we got a little bit of a menu here let
05:53 - me take this top 100
05:54 - and left out let's see if it even really
05:56 - does anything
05:58 - okay it's not really mattering right now
06:00 - but i'm assuming
06:02 - the reason i just i did that was to
06:06 - override any browser specific defaults
06:08 - that might be messing with it so for
06:10 - example like top zero percent we'll be
06:11 - covering that button the parent uh which
06:14 - is the position relative if i do 100
06:16 - it's at the
06:17 - it's 100 down that that height so it
06:20 - keeps it down there so that's good
06:23 - okay so now what i want to do is i want
06:25 - to fix those links there to make it look
06:27 - like a better list
06:30 - so i'm going to say
06:31 - drop down
06:33 - double underscore
06:36 - no drop down
06:38 - hover
06:39 - and then uh combine that with drop down
06:42 - double underscore menu
06:45 - okay
06:45 - display block when i hover it's going to
06:48 - be display block now remember keep in
06:50 - mind this is normally not displayed at
06:52 - all but i'm
06:53 - displaying it as none so the reason why
06:56 - i put that there is because i'm going to
06:57 - say display take away display none and
07:00 - put that back in and so now it's not
07:02 - there but when i hover boom it's display
07:04 - block so now it appears so now we're
07:06 - playing with an actual drop down menu
07:09 - okay
07:09 - we're going to say padding 10 pixels
07:11 - start making this look a little bit
07:12 - better
07:14 - text decoration
07:16 - none i don't want those links to have
07:18 - underlines
07:19 - border top solid one pixel
07:24 - one pixel
07:26 - e o e o e o e zero e zero e zero save it
07:29 - check it out so far looking better uh
07:32 - but those
07:33 - list items need to be oh you know what i
07:35 - didn't do this right drop down hover
07:37 - final drop down menu is display block
07:41 - but now this is going to be drop down
07:45 - menu
07:46 - a
07:48 - a
07:49 - there we go so now we're going to say
07:51 - those links do that that's better right
07:53 - there kind of things are looking a
07:55 - little silly we're going to say border
07:57 - none and also display block that's
08:00 - something that we need to do
08:03 - now this is looking much nicer in fact
08:06 - it's just about done so now what i want
08:08 - to do is say drop down
08:10 - double underscore menu a and then when
08:13 - you hover over the a
08:16 - elements
08:17 - background is going to be f o f o f o or
08:20 - f zero f zero f zero
08:22 - not f o because you can't put the letter
08:24 - o in there f zero color and then three
08:27 - two three be
08:29 - forty save that check it out boom boom
08:32 - look at that that is a nice
08:34 - tidy little
08:35 - css only drop down with only about
08:38 - 49 lines of css and very minimal markup
08:41 - just a few lines of html so there is
08:43 - your css only drop down menu thanks for
08:46 - spending some time with me today coding
08:48 - up the drop down menu can't wait to see
08:49 - you in day number 28 and don't forget
08:54 - [Music]
09:10 - [Music]
09:18 - good job buddy
