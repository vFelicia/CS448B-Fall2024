00:00 - hey what's up welcome back to css3 in 30
00:02 - days this is day seven we're going to be
00:03 - doing some image manipulation purely
00:05 - with css over here in my browser check
00:08 - it out right here day 7 image
00:09 - manipulation i'm going to show you what
00:10 - we're going to do so basically we're
00:12 - going to use these nice beautiful images
00:16 - that i'm pulling from unsplash and i'll
00:18 - show you there in the markup in a moment
00:20 - how that how that happens but what i'm
00:22 - doing is i'm using some css3
00:25 - filters
00:26 - to manipulate the images so here are the
00:29 - original images right here
00:31 - and you can see they're just
00:33 - normal images
00:35 - but then down here they have different
00:37 - styles you can see this first one is
00:39 - black and white and when i hover it can
00:41 - change changes back to its original
00:42 - color and the second one is blurred and
00:44 - when i hover
00:46 - it goes
00:47 - back to its original focus so it looks
00:49 - like it has this kind of cool focus
00:51 - effect
00:52 - and this one is inverted if i hover it
00:55 - goes back to the original image
00:57 - this one is sepia tone and then when i
00:59 - hover it goes back to original image so
01:01 - it's pretty cool you could do some basic
01:02 - photo editing and manipulation
01:05 - in css without having to go into
01:07 - photoshop so if you want to make it
01:08 - image black and white or sepia toned or
01:10 - you want to blur it a little bit or you
01:11 - want to play around with it like that
01:13 - you can just use css3 so head over to
01:16 - the code editor here and make sure you
01:18 - download the course files for this
01:20 - lesson it is seven
01:21 - image manipulation as always there's an
01:24 - index a final and a sandbox file
01:27 - and the index here i'm going to show you
01:28 - i'm just pulling some images from
01:31 - unsplash so basically this is like a
01:32 - placeholder image you can pull them in
01:34 - like so so unsplash.it 500 by 300 is the
01:38 - dimensions
01:39 - the query string image equals one uh
01:41 - 1074 which is the the id of the image if
01:44 - you change that it'll pull up a
01:45 - different image so it's kind of a cool
01:47 - way of showing images uh on your
01:49 - websites for placeholders or for images
01:52 - because unsplash is a free stock
01:53 - photography site okay
01:55 - so
01:56 - you can see here on each of the images i
01:58 - have classes so i have the image the
02:00 - first one is grayscale the second one is
02:01 - blur
02:03 - invert and sepia
02:05 - and in the final css you can see all
02:07 - this the styles here which we're going
02:08 - to be coding up it's pretty
02:09 - straightforward so let's go ahead and
02:11 - open our sandbox dot css
02:14 - and let's get started the first thing
02:16 - we're going to do is select
02:19 - all of the images within the
02:22 - sandbox so sandbox
02:25 - image
02:26 - and we're going to say
02:28 - webkit transition
02:31 - all 0.3 seconds and ease
02:35 - copy that and just have a fallback for
02:37 - transition here
02:39 - beauty just like that and what we're
02:41 - going to do is we're also going to say
02:44 - sandbox
02:46 - image
02:48 - on hover and we're just gonna say cursor
02:50 - cross hair just uh for something
02:53 - different when you hover over the image
02:55 - i want the cursor to change to across
02:56 - here
02:58 - purely for user experience nothing else
03:01 - okay and now let's get right to it we're
03:03 - going to say grayscale is the first set
03:04 - of the first image and we're going to do
03:07 - webkit filter this is the css
03:10 - that we're going to be doing
03:12 - you're going to be using it's a css
03:14 - style called filter but webkit filter is
03:17 - the uh the browser prefix for webkit
03:21 - and we're going to say grayscale and
03:23 - then in parentheses you put the amount
03:25 - you want it to be grayscale so i'm just
03:27 - going to say 1 for 100
03:30 - because you could do a sliding scale and
03:33 - let's copy this paste it out and just do
03:35 - filter
03:36 - whoa that was interesting
03:39 - there we go save that and let's go check
03:40 - it out so here we go we've got the
03:43 - grayscale image here
03:45 - uh just like that so that one we've
03:47 - changed to grayscale so now if i go back
03:49 - to the code editor and maybe i change
03:50 - this to like 0.5
03:53 - and see what that looks like you can see
03:55 - over here it actually is 50 grayscale so
03:58 - it's kind of a cool um
04:01 - effect you can actually have it be
04:02 - varying degrees it doesn't have to be
04:04 - hard black and white you know it could
04:06 - be any uh percentage in between which is
04:08 - really cool
04:09 - i'm gonna go back and change it to one
04:11 - and now what i want to do is on hover i
04:13 - want it to go back to its original
04:17 - style
04:19 - the original image so i'm going to paste
04:21 - the same
04:22 - rule here
04:24 - and i'm just going to change this to
04:25 - grayscale 0 and grayscale 0 on hover
04:30 - so now if i save that go back to the
04:32 - browser when i hover it's going to have
04:34 - that effect
04:36 - and i can see when i'm hovering here
04:38 - it's just
04:39 - turning it on and off it's not doing the
04:41 - transition that we set up so if i go
04:43 - back to my brow code editor here i can
04:45 - actually see that i've made a typo in
04:47 - line seven sandbox it needs to be sand
04:49 - box with the d naught sand box
04:52 - so now if i save that and check it out
04:54 - it should have that effect beautiful
04:55 - nice and subtle just like that
04:58 - all right so now let's move on to the
04:59 - next uh image and that's going to be the
05:02 - blur image so it's just the class of
05:03 - blur
05:05 - we have webkit filter again we're just
05:07 - using filters it's pretty simple and
05:09 - we're using blur
05:11 - we're going to say 3 pixel blur you can
05:14 - again you can change that to different
05:15 - values
05:16 - and i'm going to just have the fallback
05:18 - here just like so and let's go ahead and
05:22 - copy that paste it and what we're going
05:24 - to do here is change the blur back to
05:27 - zero
05:29 - on hover
05:31 - so we'll just do that right out the gate
05:32 - save that check it out over here in the
05:34 - browser now if i scroll down to image
05:36 - two it's blurred awesome hover going
05:40 - back to normal it's fading in and out
05:42 - looks really nice now what if we made it
05:44 - like i don't know what's a one pixel
05:45 - blur look like let's check it out in the
05:47 - browser again
05:48 - more subtle
05:49 - it's just kind of slightly blurred
05:52 - and if we did something wild like 10
05:54 - pixels
05:56 - that that image is going to be super
05:58 - blurry you can hardly even notice it so
06:00 - that's kind of a cool little effect you
06:02 - know maybe that's coming you're getting
06:04 - some ideas thinking about what you could
06:05 - do with that
06:07 - you know if you wanted to reveal
06:08 - something if you have a portfolio
06:09 - website you want to reveal you know this
06:11 - is your background and you have text
06:13 - overlaid and then when you hover it the
06:16 - image kind of fades in or whatever you
06:17 - want to do there's certain things that
06:18 - you could do just in css just to give a
06:21 - nice user experience
06:23 - using the webkit filters
06:25 - uh okay so save that i'm just gonna make
06:27 - it three pixels again now the next one
06:29 - we're gonna change uh it to an inversion
06:33 - of the color so all we're going to do
06:34 - here is do the class of invert
06:37 - and we're going to do the webkit filter
06:38 - again
06:40 - and you guessed it invert
06:43 - parentheses this is going to be one or
06:46 - zero
06:47 - i believe we could do a sliding scale
06:48 - again we'll try it again in a moment
06:50 - and i'm going to change this to filter
06:52 - invert 1 and let's copy that do a
06:56 - hovered version of that
06:59 - and again you guessed it you're probably
07:01 - ahead of me now invert zero we're gonna
07:03 - switch it back to normal on hover save
07:06 - it go to your browser check it out it's
07:08 - fully inverted the colors are when you
07:10 - hover it goes back to normal now what if
07:12 - we changed it to a different value like
07:15 - 0.5 again just half
07:18 - does that actually work if you go over
07:20 - to the browser
07:21 - it doesn't quite look like it does
07:25 - what if i i don't know maybe i'll try a
07:27 - different value
07:31 - okay yeah
07:33 - it kind of does something there
07:37 - it looks like it's almost like an
07:38 - opacity
07:40 - if i say that to .09
07:42 - so yeah it kind of does the trick there
07:45 - i wonder if two does anything
07:47 - no two doesn't do anything so it's just
07:49 - kind of one and it looks like you can do
07:51 - less
07:53 - so it almost looks like it's like an
07:54 - opacity uh
07:56 - how much of it you can see it's not
07:58 - actually inverting the color
08:02 - so much as it's just making it
08:04 - gray so it's kind of like it
08:07 - it's not even opacity it's just like you
08:09 - can't quite see the full inversion so uh
08:12 - if you want to stick to the inversion i
08:13 - don't really know when you use this
08:15 - anyway uh
08:16 - one and zero stick to a binary numbers
08:19 - here
08:20 - there it is okay now the next one let's
08:22 - move on to something else let's do sepia
08:24 - this is one that i can see you using
08:26 - sepia
08:28 - we're gonna do webkit filter again
08:30 - and we're gonna do sepia
08:33 - and
08:34 - one
08:35 - and we're gonna do filter here
08:38 - and we're gonna copy that out
08:41 - and we're going to paste that we're
08:42 - going to make it a hover
08:45 - and we're going to change that back to
08:47 - zero
08:48 - save that and let's check it out in the
08:50 - browser
08:52 - there is our sepia tone right there
08:55 - and you hover
08:56 - it toggles it in and out and so there
08:58 - you have it there are some examples of
08:59 - of the css filters now if you want to
09:02 - play around with them a little bit more
09:03 - you can actually check out the css3
09:05 - filter property
09:06 - online google it w3schools.com is a
09:08 - great resource and you can see all the
09:09 - different versions and how to play
09:11 - around with them so here for example
09:13 - there these are the different filters so
09:14 - there's blur which uses a pixel uh
09:17 - measurement brightness
09:19 - contrast
09:20 - drop shadows
09:22 - grayscale hue rotate invert which is
09:25 - actually percentage so we were actually
09:28 - using uh just zeros and ones if we
09:31 - wanted to use a percentage here that
09:32 - might have been a better choice let's do
09:34 - 50 and 50
09:36 - save that go to invert
09:39 - and again the 50
09:40 - was kind of like the 0.5 so maybe i
09:43 - don't really know what goes on there but
09:44 - if i do 70 you can see it partially so
09:47 - yeah
09:49 - i'm going to stick to one for now
09:52 - unusual let's go back to the browser
09:54 - here so you can see there's opacity
09:55 - saturate if you want to saturate the
09:56 - image a little bit more
09:59 - uh
10:00 - sepia
10:01 - url that's if you want to use xml files
10:03 - that has svg filters and then just
10:05 - initial and inherit so those are the
10:07 - different css3 filter functions that you
10:10 - can use uh feel free to read up on it if
10:12 - you want or play around with it and
10:13 - experiment and that is it for day seven
10:15 - hang tight we have some more fun stuff
10:17 - in fact we have a really cool project
10:19 - that we're going to build tomorrow see
10:20 - you then

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up welcome back to css3 in 30 days this is day seven we're going to be doing some image manipulation purely with css over here in my browser check it out right here day 7 image manipulation i'm going to show you what we're going to do so basically we're going to use these nice beautiful images that i'm pulling from unsplash and i'll show you there in the markup in a moment how that how that happens but what i'm doing is i'm using some css3 filters to manipulate the images so here are the original images right here and you can see they're just normal images but then down here they have different styles you can see this first one is black and white and when i hover it can change changes back to its original color and the second one is blurred and when i hover it goes back to its original focus so it looks like it has this kind of cool focus effect and this one is inverted if i hover it goes back to the original image this one is sepia tone and then when i hover it goes back to original image so it's pretty cool you could do some basic photo editing and manipulation in css without having to go into photoshop so if you want to make it image black and white or sepia toned or you want to blur it a little bit or you want to play around with it like that you can just use css3 so head over to the code editor here and make sure you download the course files for this lesson it is seven image manipulation as always there's an index a final and a sandbox file and the index here i'm going to show you i'm just pulling some images from unsplash so basically this is like a placeholder image you can pull them in like so so unsplash.it 500 by 300 is the dimensions the query string image equals one uh 1074 which is the the id of the image if you change that it'll pull up a different image so it's kind of a cool way of showing images uh on your websites for placeholders or for images because unsplash is a free stock photography site okay so you can see here on each of the images i have classes so i have the image the first one is grayscale the second one is blur invert and sepia and in the final css you can see all this the styles here which we're going to be coding up it's pretty straightforward so let's go ahead and open our sandbox dot css and let's get started the first thing we're going to do is select all of the images within the sandbox so sandbox image and we're going to say webkit transition all 0.3 seconds and ease copy that and just have a fallback for transition here beauty just like that and what we're going to do is we're also going to say sandbox image on hover and we're just gonna say cursor cross hair just uh for something different when you hover over the image i want the cursor to change to across here purely for user experience nothing else okay and now let's get right to it we're going to say grayscale is the first set of the first image and we're going to do webkit filter this is the css that we're going to be doing you're going to be using it's a css style called filter but webkit filter is the uh the browser prefix for webkit and we're going to say grayscale and then in parentheses you put the amount you

white you know it could be any uh percentage in between which is really cool i'm gonna go back and change it to one and now what i want to do is on hover i want it to go back to its original style the original image so i'm going to paste the same rule here and i'm just going to change this to grayscale 0 and grayscale 0 on hover so now if i save that go back to the browser when i hover it's going to have that effect and i can see when i'm hovering here it's just turning it on and off it's not doing the transition that we set up so if i go back to my brow code editor here i can actually see that i've made a typo in line seven sandbox it needs to be sand box with the d naught sand box so now if i save that and check it out it should have that effect beautiful nice and subtle just like that all right so now let's move on to the next uh image and that's going to be the blur image so it's just the class of blur we have webkit filter again we're just using filters it's pretty simple
