00:00 - Hey FreeCodeCamp and welcome to another daily program or web series and in this one
00:07 - We're going to be talking about the 3-sum problem. Which is number 323 posted on the daily program or subreddit?
00:09 - Let's go ahead and break it down on the whiteboard
00:11 - So the 3-sum problem is defined like so, given an array or lists of numbers. print out all the combinations of  3 numbers which when summed up
00:22 - Equate to zero so for example if I were to try to choose  -8 , - 7 and 5 as our first combination
00:31 - When added together do these sum up to 0 and this will be no because we actually get -10 when we send this up
00:40 - so then we can try another combination such as -8, 5 and 2 and
00:47 - When this is sum together we are left with a -1
00:50 - So again know this combination is not sum to 0 and then the last combination
00:55 - we can actually try would be - 7 5 and 2
00:59 - which when summed up it does give us 0
01:03 - So in this particular input case where we had  -8 ,-7 5 and 2,
01:09 - the only combination of three numbers that sum to 0 would be this combination right here
01:13 - So we print this out to the console or return in some type of array, and that would be your solution for that input.
01:18 - So that basically sums up the 3-sum problem
01:21 - Lets go ahead and break this down further to visualize with more combinations
01:25 - so let's first reduce the larger problem into something easier to understand such as a sub-problem where how do you find all the
01:32 - combinations, or you can pick one number and check if it sums as 0
01:37 - well, obviously we have to loop over all the numbers and only have one variable to keep track of our index and
01:44 - for each one we just print out the number and check if it equals 0 so i would be 0
01:50 - and
01:51 - of course, we increment i
01:54 - we get -7 we increment i again
01:59 - to get 5 and
02:02 - then we increment i one more time to get 2
02:06 - So that should be obvious right? If you wanted to check all the combinations of one number
02:10 - You just have the for loop and loop over and print out the number
02:13 - But now let's say you wanted to print out all the combinations where you would pick two numbers.
02:18 - So in this case we have to first
02:21 - keep track of i and then also keep track of j. It should be equal to i + 1
02:27 - So if you were to increment through this we first print out - 8,
02:32 - -7
02:33 - we increment i by 1 or-- sorry, we increment j by 1
02:39 - to print out  -8 and 5
02:44 - increment j again,
02:46 - which allows us to print out the combination  - 8 and
02:49 - 2, and then when j hits the end of the array we go ahead and increment i by 1 and
02:57 - set j  = i + 1
03:00 - which gives us -7 in 5 and then increment j again,
03:06 - which gives us -7 in
03:09 - 2 and
03:11 - Then lastly we're going to increment i and set j = i + 1 which gives us our last combination
03:18 - of 5 and 2.
03:21 - So hopefully that makes sense basically in this case
03:23 - we have two for loops where we have one loop that loops over i to the end of the array and
03:29 - then nested inside that we have another loop where j = i + 1 and then we loop to the end of
03:34 - the array. And that will give us all the different combinations where we can pick two numbers
03:39 - So then you can kind of intuitively think well if we need to pick 3 numbers for this 3-sum problem
03:45 - We just need to add another loop, right? So again, let's work through that so instead of just having 2 we'd have an i
03:53 - we have a j and we have a k.
03:56 - So starting off, k would be  j+1 and j = i +1
04:00 - So this will give us our first combination of -8 , -7
04:04 - and 5 and then
04:08 - we just go ahead and increment
04:10 - k by 1
04:14 - Which gives us -8 , -7 and 2 .
04:20 - Since k is reached the end we increment j by 1 and
04:25 - then set k = j + 1 which gives us the combination - 8 , - 7 sorry--
04:29 - -8
04:33 - 5 and 2 and
04:35 - Then lastly since j has reached the last part of theory that it can get to, we need to increment i by 1
04:43 - Set j = i +1 and set k = j +1 which will give us a very last combination of - 7
04:50 - 5 and 2 so that's kind of how you work out printing out all the different combinations on paper
04:55 - And then it should be intuitive how you do that in the computer with 3 4 loops
04:59 - And then down here you just send them up
05:02 - See if they equal to 0 and of course the only solution that equals 0 will be this last combination here
05:08 - So as you add more numbers down the road
05:12 - Your loops will just go further and further and they print out more combinations
05:16 - So let's go ahead and go to Javascript and try to implement this logic
05:21 - So after we're looking at the whiteboard example of how to solve this problem
05:24 - It should be pretty straightforward of how to implement it right ? We talked about learning in three different loops for i j and k
05:32 - and the hard part is just going to be figuring out how to initialize our where to initialize the i
05:37 - j and k add and then how far they should loop over
05:40 - so starting off is going to write a function called threeSums and it's going to take in a parameter of
05:46 - numbers
05:48 - Then in here. We're going to go ahead and declare an array called sets and return that which is going to be
05:54 - You know all the different combinations?
05:55 - We found which do match zero and then here we have to start doing our loop so we can say for
06:02 - Let i = 0 , i < numbers.length - 2
06:06 - because if you remember, we stopped two away from the ending of the number list
06:14 - so you can increment that and
06:16 - Then we can declare a j = i +1
06:18 - because we need to start 1 after the i and?
06:25 - Then we can say j < number. length - 1
06:28 - because again an example. We stopped 1 away from the end because k will always take that last spot
06:38 - and
06:39 - Then lastly  we can say like k = j + 1
06:44 - and then k < numbers.length  and
06:47 - then increment k because k will go all the way to the end of the array .
06:53 - So now that we have our three loops ,what we can do here is declare three numbers
06:58 - So I'll set const a = numbers[i] , say const b = numbers[j]
07:06 - and the finally const c = [k]
07:10 -  
07:11 - So that will give us our three numbers to make up the combination
07:15 - And then lastly we can check if a + b + c = 0
07:20 - We go ahead and push into that sets array
07:24 - Those three numbers, so I'll just go ahead and represent that as a string here of a string of a b and C
07:31 - and
07:33 - Then at the end. We just return our sets
07:36 - So now I should be able to run this and should give us all the combinations which sum to zero
07:42 - So one thing to point out here
07:43 - Is that what's printed out is going to contain duplicate combinations, and that is because a set that we put in as the input has
07:51 - Multiple numbers of the same type, so a simple check we can do to make sure that duplicates
07:56 - do not happen is we can say add an end for this check so a b and C adds together equal zero and
08:04 - sets index of
08:06 - Set is equal to -1 then up here. I can say set is equal to that string array
08:15 - and I can push that
08:17 - So one more time we're just pulling out that string that picked ,a variable, we're checking if the array already contains
08:24 - that string or that set
08:26 - which means index of equal to - 1 which we haven't seen it before and
08:30 - Then finally we just push it into the set as we did before
08:34 - So now I run this we hit all the combinations that sum to zero, and we don't get duplicates
08:39 - All right, so that wraps up the three sums problem
08:42 - There's other ways to solve this there's actually a faster way to do this
08:46 - Which if you go to the summer edit you can read about that but for the most part?
08:50 - I think this is a good overview of how to write code to solve a whole like combinations problem
08:55 - All right, if you like this tutorial give us a thumbs up and be sure to subscribe to free code camp below alright
09:00 - Thanks for watching
