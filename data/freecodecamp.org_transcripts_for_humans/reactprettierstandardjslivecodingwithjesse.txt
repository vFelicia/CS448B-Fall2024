00:04 - hey everybody it's
00:06 - Jesse uh sorry I did not get the Tweet
00:10 - out about this video until uh 3 minutes
00:13 - ago so I don't know if how many people
00:17 - rely on Twitter uh to know when I'm
00:19 - going to go live so maybe it'll be a
00:22 - little bit slower here at the beginning
00:24 - in terms of viewers uh also I didn't
00:27 - even get the uh event scheduled until
00:29 - maybe about an hour ago so uh today's
00:32 - just been I got in late
00:35 - and I
00:37 - had all kind of stuff going on I
00:40 - actually just interviewed a student uh
00:43 - who's interested in
00:45 - working uh with my
00:48 - department uh so that would be awesome
00:50 - if it works out I know uh he has another
00:53 - interview uh with a company near here as
00:56 - well so I wish him luck with that but uh
01:00 - hopefully he decides to work with
01:04 - us so yeah I'm just going to wait I'm
01:07 - not going to get started for maybe a
01:08 - couple minutes we'll just talk for a
01:10 - little bit uh just to wait for some
01:11 - people to come in
01:13 - because I um I alerted this so late
01:17 - there we go okay now now we're at a
01:19 - normal it was showing seven viewers for
01:21 - a while and now it just jumped to 54 so
01:24 - that's closer to our normal amount of
01:28 - viewers um
01:32 - all right uh we got some yeah we got
01:36 - some people looks like some new new
01:39 - faces new names in the live chat um that
01:43 - I haven't I don't remember seeing before
01:45 - so hey
01:46 - everybody oh we got hello from the
01:48 - Ukraine
01:50 - awesome and let's see La tell me if I
01:54 - pronounce this wrong is it Laquita or
01:58 - Lita uh let let me know how if I
02:00 - pronounce that right
02:02 - um uh
02:04 - but on time for a live chat so
02:13 - awesome and um Yousef asked will you do
02:17 - a to-do app with react from scratch okay
02:20 - now we're picking up we're up over 70
02:22 - viewers now so let's um let's get
02:25 - started all right everybody shouting out
02:27 - where they're from we got India
02:28 - Barcelona UK
02:31 - awesome thanks for
02:34 - watching from from
02:37 - Chile from Rome awesome wow we got we
02:41 - got people from all over so and it looks
02:43 - like yeah it looks like we're getting
02:45 - some retweets here so that's picking up
02:48 - picking up fast from Los Angeles
02:54 - Romania uh all right so
02:57 - today I'm really excited about this talk
02:59 - topic and uh this was totally um I
03:02 - hadn't planned on doing this today but I
03:04 - got a pull
03:06 - request um
03:09 - from uh well I actually got two pool
03:12 - requests so let me let me bring these
03:14 - over just to show you because I want to
03:15 - give give credit where it is due so
03:19 - between yesterday's show and Today's
03:21 - Show I got two pool requests this one is
03:24 - from Danny and um you can check that I'm
03:27 - not going to go through all these on the
03:29 - air because you can see in the link in
03:31 - the show description uh you can check
03:34 - these out but had some cool stuff here
03:36 - um kind of preparing for even more so
03:39 - I'm I'm expecting I guess another
03:41 - another Pool request here um but did
03:44 - some kind of some optimization things so
03:48 - not no changes that would really be
03:50 - visible like uh to the user uh but
03:53 - definitely going to make things more
03:55 - readable easier to maintain um in terms
03:58 - of the code the other other pool request
04:01 - uh this is what we're going to be
04:02 - talking about today uh so vet this is
04:05 - his second pool request uh he had a
04:07 - great one um I think it was a few days
04:10 - ago or maybe uh yeah I think it was
04:12 - Friday uh that we talked about yesterday
04:14 - but this one uh so if you were here
04:17 - yesterday for the live chat uh there was
04:20 - some talk about
04:21 - using uh some linters and things to try
04:24 - to get more of a standard um uh style to
04:28 - the coding so uh I I haven't I've been a
04:32 - little bit sloppy in coding this and in
04:36 - general I've been sloppy for for two
04:37 - reasons one the timeline for this was
04:39 - really tight so I just kind of cut
04:42 - Corners uh in in terms of formatting
04:45 - everything
04:46 - properly uh to to get it launched also
04:50 - it's it's always been just me working on
04:52 - projects and that's allowed me to get a
04:53 - little bit lazy because nobody's ever
04:55 - around to call me out on it and um I'm
04:58 - not saying that that's a a good thing
04:59 - that's definitely not a good thing but
05:01 - that's just how it happened uh but now
05:04 - it makes a lot more sense for me to have
05:07 - kind of a standard format for my code
05:11 - because all of you are looking at the
05:13 - code and you're you're helping me we're
05:14 - collaborating on this so great
05:17 - idea so we're going to use I don't know
05:20 - if you can hear that but my stomach is
05:21 - growling so if you hear that I'm sorry
05:24 - sorry but I just um I forgot to eat
05:26 - today so uh I don't know if that happens
05:29 - to you but sometimes you just get you
05:31 - get working and you know before you know
05:33 - it uh you haven't eaten so I have to
05:36 - make sure I eat after this stream um so
05:40 - we're going to use a couple of things
05:42 - and uh you've probably been seeing some
05:43 - of these things uh I know at least I've
05:45 - been seeing them on Twitter a lot
05:47 - mentioned uh prettier and standard
05:51 - JS I'm going to kind of take you through
05:55 - um what I did I I know it looks like I
05:57 - haven't merged these yet but I I did
05:58 - merge them I just haven't pushed it uh
06:01 - back up to uh to
06:02 - GitHub but let me bring over two things
06:06 - I'm going to bring over my command line
06:09 - and I'm also going to bring over or I'm
06:10 - going to show you the code I've Linked
06:13 - In the show notes to standard JS their
06:17 - website and to the website for prettier
06:19 - so you can check that out you know kind
06:21 - of as we're going if you want to learn
06:22 - more about it and first of all let me
06:26 - show
06:28 - you I I do I want to show you the amount
06:30 - of errors that I had once I finally ran
06:33 - this uh so let me go back up so this is
06:37 - kind
06:38 - of I like slowly just narrow down the
06:41 - errors I think this is the first set
06:44 - so at first I had all these errors of
06:48 - just things a lot of them was components
06:51 - that I had imported or into another
06:53 - component and then I never used it so I
06:56 - had I guess at some point thought I was
06:58 - going to use use it and then never
07:00 - removed it I was really surprised at how
07:02 - many of those there were because I I
07:05 - thought that I was usually uh pretty
07:07 - careful about that but evidently I was
07:09 - not uh so those are a bunch of bunch of
07:11 - stuff there also if you remember from
07:14 - our episode whenever we uh we were
07:16 - making jQuery work with react and we had
07:20 - a bunch of
07:22 - functions in a separate file in our in
07:25 - our um what what file was it our app.js
07:28 - file yeah so we had in a separate file
07:32 - we had these functions that were using
07:33 - jQuery but then we were calling them in
07:35 - component did Mount
07:38 - so to um when we're using standard JS
07:42 - which uses uh es lent kind of behind the
07:44 - scenes it was looking at that component
07:47 - and saying you're trying to call this
07:48 - function and it's not defined it really
07:51 - it was defined in our other um our other
07:54 - document and then not only that but it
07:55 - was looking at that document where we
07:58 - actually had to find those functions and
08:00 - saying hey you define this and you never
08:01 - used it so so most of the errors I had
08:05 - were because of that okay so not really
08:07 - a big deal so I'll show you how I fix
08:09 - those errors because I'm I'm guessing
08:11 - that maybe if you're going to try to use
08:13 - this for the first time you might run
08:14 - into some of these errors as well I mean
08:17 - maybe hopefully you're not as as bad as
08:19 - I was with uh with my code and you don't
08:22 - get as many errors but I'll show you how
08:24 - to go over those uh how to fix those
08:26 - errors I'm going to show you my package
08:28 - Json first first so that if you if you
08:31 - want to try this out but you don't
08:32 - really want to like pull down my code uh
08:35 - you can just kind of piece it together
08:36 - so let's move this off before I show you
08:39 - how I I did those and we'll go to my
08:41 - package Json let me know if this is this
08:44 - is too small I'll just I could probably
08:47 - let me make it a little bit bigger right
08:48 - now I don't want to make it too big
08:50 - because I want you to be able to see
08:51 - kind of like the big picture here um of
08:54 - what we what we have now that we didn't
08:57 - have before and I have have some things
08:59 - up here that are new too but they don't
09:01 - really apply to what we're talking about
09:03 - today so basically we have this whole
09:04 - section now that's Dev
09:07 - dependencies
09:08 - and this this is what has been brought
09:12 - in okay and remember this is all from
09:14 - ven's uh pool request almost none of
09:16 - this is stuff that I did the only thing
09:18 - in here that I did on my own was I I
09:20 - imported this uh Babel es lint um
09:24 - package uh and I'll explain why I needed
09:26 - that in a minute um so basically
09:29 - these these four things got this
09:32 - working and then we have some new
09:34 - commands so we have this lint all right
09:37 - we have pre-commit and then we have lint
09:39 - lint staged all right so we have a lot
09:41 - of things going here where basically vet
09:43 - set this up uh which is very very nice
09:45 - of him he set all this up to look
09:48 - through all my folders where I had
09:50 - components and JavaScript
09:54 - files and to go through lint those and
09:58 - then automatically reformat them based
10:02 - on the standard JS um
10:05 - specifications okay so that's what the
10:08 - the linting all right is more like the
10:10 - standard JS the reformatting is from
10:12 - prettier okay and if you check out the
10:14 - docs for those uh you'll
10:19 - see so this is what's added also I I
10:25 - added this part down here and this was
10:27 - basically to deal with some of the
10:28 - errors so I'll talk about that in a
10:31 - second uh when I deal with those
10:36 - errors and that's it and as soon
10:39 - as I'm going to push this code I might
10:42 - as well do it right now let me push this
10:43 - to GitHub right now so you can follow
10:45 - along and everything is um is up to
10:58 - date
11:02 - on my other screen I'm just making this
11:05 - um I
11:06 - figure you um you all know how to run a
11:10 - commit uh but also you see this is new
11:13 - so this is um basically this is
11:16 - happening right when we run a commit
11:19 - before we were just doing a commit
11:21 - now all of this
11:26 - runs before the commit happens so really
11:28 - you can't you can't make a commit now
11:30 - without everything being put in uh a
11:33 - standard format which is awesome and
11:36 - that was that was from vet that's what
11:39 - um his additions here are
11:42 - doing all right
11:46 - so all this is now being pushed to the
11:50 - master branch and it's completed so if
11:52 - you go to the repo on the master Branch
11:54 - you can see all of this you can open up
11:56 - the uh package Json you can see
11:58 - everything I'm talking about and follow
11:59 - along uh so let me talk about some of
12:02 - these
12:04 - errors I'm not going to go over every
12:06 - single error just the ones that I think
12:07 - were kind of
12:09 - like it it was kind of tricky for me to
12:12 - figure out and uh kind of like to share
12:15 - how to get around those
12:18 - so um let's see we
12:24 - had these ones as I said are are really
12:27 - easy I just Define these components and
12:29 - hadn't used them okay so some of
12:32 - these like I said I had been defining
12:35 - these
12:37 - functions and not actually using them
12:41 - well I was defining them in the app.js
12:45 - file but not using them there and then I
12:47 - was using them in components but it was
12:48 - coming up as not defined so here's how I
12:50 - got around that so for some of them like
12:52 - for Fetch and for you know the dollar
12:56 - sign I just added them globally
12:59 - as uh since basically I use fetch in
13:02 - almost all the uh page level
13:05 - components so if you just add this you
13:08 - know this this whole section here okay
13:12 - including the ending things that fix
13:14 - that so basically that just lets es lint
13:18 - know that it's okay uh you can use these
13:22 - they're defined somewhere and it's all
13:24 - right to you so that fixed those errors
13:26 - but then you don't want to do this for
13:28 - for everything let's say you only use
13:30 - something once you don't want to make it
13:31 - a global so at the page
13:34 - level I did something like this so I use
13:37 - in component did Mount I use init tabs
13:40 - okay this is like I said this is defined
13:42 - over here in
13:43 - appjs so what I did here is I just added
13:47 - at the top in the comment Global and
13:50 - then the name of this function okay and
13:54 - that got rid of that error and I did a
13:56 - similar thing in every component I just
13:58 - put the name of the function so that got
13:59 - rid of those errors you know no big deal
14:02 - in reality at some point if I have more
14:05 - time now I know I've I've discussed this
14:07 - already with with all of you that this
14:10 - project needs to wind up so there's some
14:12 - things that I know should be done that
14:14 - may not get done because um they're not
14:17 - essential to the project functioning and
14:19 - I need to move on because I have a lot
14:21 - of other projects that are lining up
14:23 - that I need to uh to start working on
14:26 - so um we'll see maybe if I get some of
14:29 - these student workers that might be a
14:31 - good thing a good project for them to
14:33 - come in and and do some of this but I
14:35 - figure you know there's definitely a
14:37 - better way to do this than to have all
14:39 - this going in a a you know separate file
14:41 - so
14:43 - um that may happen at some
14:47 - point now the next the next error that I
14:50 - do want to talk about that was the
14:54 - trickiest was this
14:57 - one
15:00 - so in resources. JS which is the file
15:03 - we're in now it said there's a parsing
15:05 - error unexpected token equals on line in
15:10 - this case it was line 11 which this is
15:12 - probably different now since I had
15:14 - changed it so the line it is now is at
15:16 - 12 so it was basically throwing an error
15:18 - because we did
15:21 - this so the way that I found uh to get
15:24 - around this is um basically it wasn't it
15:29 - wasn't recognizing that like we're using
15:31 - this class here okay so it had something
15:33 - to do with that all right I'm not
15:35 - claiming that I know technically
15:37 - everything that was going on but
15:38 - basically the problem was that this is a
15:41 - newer syntax and it needed to recognize
15:44 - that as a newer syntax
15:47 - so that's why I
15:50 - installed this Babel es
15:53 - lent okay if you're not familiar with
15:55 - Babel that's a transpiler that lets you
15:57 - use the latest JavaScript syntax and it
16:00 - turns it into older syntax that older
16:03 - browsers can handle okay so I imported
16:07 - this so just yarn add Babel es lint and
16:10 - then I added the flag um hyphen capital
16:14 - D okay or you could do hyphen hyen Dev
16:18 - either way it'll put in your Dev
16:21 - dependencies that added it here and then
16:24 - down here you can add you can say what
16:26 - parser you want ES to use so I added
16:32 - this to the pars so I'm I'm saying es
16:35 - lent but just recognize that it's
16:38 - standard that's doing this but it's
16:40 - using ES lent kind of in the background
16:42 - okay so um we are talking about standard
16:45 - JS all right so that's it that's the
16:48 - only um the only things I really had to
16:50 - do I guess I'll show you the appjs just
16:52 - in case hopefully this won't be an issue
16:54 - with you because you won't have all
16:56 - these functions sitting in a separate
16:58 - fun file like this but all I did was all
17:02 - these functions are the one that I'm
17:03 - using in components and I'm not using on
17:05 - in this particular file so at the top I
17:07 - just did es lent
17:09 - disable and then at some point down here
17:12 - I reenable es
17:15 - lent so I enable it again here okay so
17:20 - the disadvantage is like everything in
17:22 - here is not getting linted properly
17:24 - although I did run lint before I did
17:26 - this so all the other errors that were
17:28 - in here here I
17:29 - fixed so these are all okay uh because I
17:33 - did it
17:34 - beforehand uh
17:37 - so I could you can actually like
17:41 - specifically uh put in like the the one
17:43 - rule that you want to rule out inside
17:46 - here but I couldn't find what it was I
17:48 - tried a couple of different ones and it
17:49 - wasn't working so just for the sake of
17:51 - getting this working before the video I
17:54 - um I just disabled everything within
17:56 - here okay
17:59 - so that's pretty much it that's all it
18:01 - took I mean on my end that's all it took
18:03 - to get this working vet I'm sure had had
18:05 - more work on his end and you can check
18:07 - out his his pool request to see all the
18:10 - work that he did and and everything that
18:12 - changed all the files that changed but
18:13 - at this
18:15 - point let me show you the results I know
18:18 - I've been ignoring the live chat uh for
18:20 - a few minutes I will get to you and I'll
18:22 - answer the questions just a minute but I
18:23 - I wanted to um I wanted to try getting
18:26 - to the point quickly and getting through
18:28 - it uh because
18:32 - usually um what happens
18:35 - is I get a bunch of viewers right off
18:38 - the bat and then we kind of like I kind
18:41 - of mess around a little bit and just
18:42 - kind of talk about some general things
18:44 - before we get started and I usually lose
18:46 - a bunch of people probably because this
18:49 - maybe is their first time viewing and
18:50 - they're thinking like what's this guy
18:52 - doing I thought he was going to talk
18:53 - about whatever I the title of the video
18:57 - is uh so that's why I'm ignoring the uh
19:00 - live chat right now but I'll get to it
19:02 - in a minute I just want to give you an
19:03 - example of how everything is um is now
19:07 - formatted kind of autof
19:10 - formatted and uh let's see let's try to
19:14 - do a side by
19:16 - side so I'm going to bring
19:19 - up this
19:23 - code and you can do you can open this up
19:25 - in GitHub as well on my other screen I'm
19:27 - just opening up this project in
19:30 - GitHub and I'm going to kind of go back
19:32 - in time to a previous commit before I
19:35 - did all
19:40 - this and we're just going to check out
19:43 - since I have the resources page up let's
19:45 - just check the resources
19:47 - page just to see what the difference
19:51 - is so I'm going to go I'm going to put
19:54 - these side by
19:57 - side make this a bit bigger for
20:02 - you and see I haven't I actually haven't
20:06 - compared this yet so hopefully it's the
20:08 - comparison is somewhat obvious so we
20:09 - might have to try another file but
20:13 - um you could see well aside from you
20:16 - know slight slight difference up
20:20 - here we have yeah so so I probably went
20:24 - back too far some of the stuff had been
20:25 - changed so let's get down more into the
20:30 - um into the body of
20:34 - this wonder if this is even going to be
20:36 - a good example no it's not because I
20:38 - went back too far sorry about that let
20:40 - me um go back
20:45 - to a commit that's
20:49 - maybe I want to go let me go somewhere
20:53 - that's maybe right there we go this this
20:57 - should be closer
21:00 - oops click the wrong
21:03 - thing here we
21:06 - go and sorry if you if you're not
21:09 - familiar with Git and GitHub and you're
21:11 - just you know kind of watching this
21:13 - you're probably somewhat confused about
21:16 - how that works so uh sorry about that if
21:18 - you watch some of the uh previous videos
21:21 - I
21:22 - explained uh
21:24 - how more about how how git Works uh
21:29 - um no my um uh my trackpad just ran out
21:34 - of batteries
21:36 - so this is terrible at least
21:40 - I now would be a great time for me to
21:42 - look back at the live
21:45 - chat and see if I can get I do have a
21:50 - mouse here I'm going to turn this mouse
21:53 - on so that I don't have to actually
21:55 - leave and go get batteries somewhere
21:59 - although I could change the batteries
22:00 - out from the mouse and put them in the
22:02 - trackpad but there we go it's just
22:04 - easier to use the mouse all right I
22:06 - haven't used Mouse in so long anybody I
22:09 - think if you use like a Macbook or an
22:11 - iMac with the trackpad you understand
22:14 - what I'm talking about once you get used
22:15 - to it it's just like Mouse using a mouse
22:18 - feels weird all right so I do have the
22:21 - mouse now um let's
22:24 - go I'm actually going to go to that app
22:28 - .js file because I think that has the
22:31 - most potential for improvement uh and
22:34 - probably the out of any of the the
22:36 - things that I've done
22:39 - so that might be the most drastic uh and
22:43 - obvious change
22:45 - so let me
22:52 - um make this a little bigger and so we
22:55 - can see so these are the same files
22:58 - before and after using uh using prettier
23:01 - so we did we did linting with uh
23:03 - standard JS and then prettier does like
23:06 - the auto
23:08 - reformatting uh
23:10 - so let's see so far not not not bad you
23:16 - so I did take this out because uh
23:18 - obviously like this is not really needed
23:20 - if we're doing going to do all our this
23:24 - lenting
23:26 - and
23:30 - I'm actually somewhat surprised at how
23:33 - well formatted this was okay big here's
23:36 - the big thing that that you can you
23:38 - probably already even caught this there
23:40 - are no semicolons at the end of the line
23:43 - here but there are here and we talked
23:45 - about this yesterday is
23:47 - that when when I was learning JavaScript
23:50 - it was always like you have to use a
23:52 - semicolon at the end of the line right I
23:54 - mean I think some of like the tutorials
23:56 - like the in browser tutorials if you
24:00 - don't put the semico and it doesn't work
24:02 - you know you have to go back and fix it
24:04 - so I'm trying to get away from that but
24:07 - obviously I'm I'm still doing it I
24:09 - probably don't even realize I'm doing it
24:11 - sometimes so with standard JS you don't
24:13 - use semicolons okay so all the
24:17 - semicolons are gone and OB and
24:19 - everything still works right it's not
24:21 - nothing's crashed uh
24:25 - so that is an obvious thing here we go
24:30 - this looks different function sticky
24:35 - nav okay so this is a big example of a
24:40 - change right this is really obvious so
24:42 - before we had I actually didn't write
24:44 - this code uh you can see I got this um
24:46 - from someone on codepen and credited and
24:49 - everything so I it's it's legit to use
24:53 - um but everything was written all in one
24:56 - line like that
24:59 - which is pretty hard to read now this is
25:03 - automatically
25:05 - done that it's all moved on to separate
25:08 - lines so yes it takes up more lines
25:11 - certainly but it's so much easier to
25:13 - read like that so that is
25:17 - one really
25:22 - useful kind of change in the uh in the
25:24 - code there the other thing it did was it
25:28 - it made me so it threw an error over
25:31 - this and it made me I was actually had
25:33 - to change
25:34 - this um I had to change this
25:38 - manually it wouldn't let me just use
25:43 - ve and Define all these things I had to
25:46 - use a separate VE for each line so I
25:51 - guess that's good to know that that's
25:53 - that's the default with standard
25:56 - JS so you get the point you can check
25:59 - out you you have access to the repo you
26:01 - can check all this out so I just wanted
26:03 - to show a quick example of how this this
26:06 - works now I will check out the live chat
26:09 - I'm sorry for having ignored you but if
26:11 - you ever watch this you know how I am
26:13 - and once I look at the live chat I tend
26:16 - to just talk a lot and uh to you all and
26:20 - answer questions so uh I wanted to make
26:22 - sure I got through this and wow okay so
26:26 - we pretty much got through most of what
26:28 - I wanted to say in less than half an
26:30 - hour so we'll say
26:32 - this if you are only here to check out
26:35 - prer in standard JS and you don't really
26:37 - care uh for any of the question and
26:39 - answer stuff uh you can uh thanks for
26:42 - watching and uh you don't have to watch
26:45 - anymore because that was the demo uh for
26:48 - all of
26:49 - that but if you do have any questions
26:51 - you want to stick around put them in the
26:53 - live chat I'll go through all the
26:54 - questions in the live chat and I'll I'll
26:56 - provide answers and uh uh a lot of times
26:59 - everybody else in the live chat provides
27:01 - really great answers as well so it's a
27:03 - good resource to you if you can't stick
27:05 - around or you're just nervous about
27:07 - asking a question in the live chat you
27:09 - can direct message me on Twitter or you
27:12 - can put it in the comments uh to this
27:14 - video uh so a link to my Twitter profile
27:17 - is in the description for the video all
27:20 - right so let's get to the chat I'm
27:23 - starting at the top and I'm just working
27:24 - my way
27:26 - down also so let me know I was getting
27:29 - some messages that the stream Health
27:31 - wasn't good so let me know if you you
27:33 - had any problems with this stream that's
27:36 - really odd usually the internet
27:37 - connection that I have um at work is is
27:41 - really really
27:44 - fast okay
27:48 - so everybody everybody if you remember
27:50 - the beginning was kind of shouting out
27:52 - where they are from which is awesome I
27:53 - love to see where you all are from so we
27:55 - had Romania Germany
28:00 - another one from Germany um somebody
28:02 - asked about my editor which uh which is
28:06 - great I don't mind I get asked that
28:08 - almost every video um but I don't really
28:12 - mind uh because you might have just
28:15 - joined in you didn't weren't able to
28:17 - check it out I do have a link in the
28:19 - description to the the tools some of the
28:21 - tools that I use so if you're interested
28:23 - in what I use check out the description
28:25 - I link pretty much everything that I'm
28:28 - using I'm I'm linking in
28:29 - there uh we got somebody else from Los
28:33 - Angeles uh let's
28:38 - see I had said earlier I talked about um
28:42 - I asked if anyone else forgot to eat
28:44 - when they were working uh and Patrick
28:46 - says forget to eat more than I remember
28:48 - to eat Rohan forgets uh sometimes I
28:52 - forget that I've eaten don't even know
28:54 - how that happens so like somewhat the
28:57 - opposite problem
29:03 - um okay so uh surv has a question and
29:07 - this this question was like maybe 20
29:09 - minutes ago so hopefully you're still
29:10 - here if not maybe somebody else had
29:13 - still wants to hear the answer uh ask
29:15 - how is this different from es lent okay
29:18 - so uh vene actually gave an answer uh
29:22 - but I'll read it out in case you're
29:23 - watching this video later on and can't
29:25 - see the live chat and the answer is as I
29:28 - mentioned standard JS uses es lint uh as
29:32 - V says under the hood so kind of in the
29:34 - background it's using ES lent okay so uh
29:38 - but it's using the
29:42 - um the standard all like what is
29:45 - specified in standard JS
29:48 - so you know if you go here and you can
29:52 - read about the JavaScript standard style
29:55 - okay so basically it's it's using ES
29:58 - lint to enforce the JavaScript standard
30:01 - style and you don't have to do any of
30:04 - the formatting like you don't have to
30:06 - configure sorry you don't have to
30:08 - configure es lint at all it does it for
30:11 - you sorry I'm going to take a
30:14 - drink okay
30:18 - um so hopefully that answers uh your
30:20 - question and uh if not uh you know ask
30:24 - for clarification and uh we can talk
30:26 - more about it
30:29 - Andrew says uh hello folks I'll watch
30:32 - the replay on way to home have fun all
30:34 - right thanks for stopping in Andrew uh
30:37 - yeah throw uh you have any questions or
30:39 - anything um later on when you watch it
30:41 - put it in the um comments
30:52 - please all right
30:56 - so Sebastian ask why don't you use a
30:58 - lter for atom so you get the errors as
31:01 - you write them actually to be honest
31:03 - with you I have up on my other screen a
31:06 - couple of atom
31:08 - plugins that were recommended uh from
31:11 - the the page the uh the page for
31:14 - standard JS so I was looking into using
31:18 - plugins for atom to do just that I just
31:21 - didn't have time to get it all working
31:24 - uh before the video so if anyone uses
31:27 - standard JS and uses atom and has a
31:30 - plugin that you want to recommend please
31:32 - let me know and uh cuz i' like I I was
31:36 - trying to read through some plugins to
31:37 - figure out which one was the best to use
31:39 - but I I didn't come to any conclusion
31:52 - yet all right we have someone from Dubai
31:56 - awesome
31:58 - uh noi says nice anyway I'm still
32:00 - learning basic JavaScript in HTML this
32:02 - stream is way above my knowledge we'll
32:04 - come back to it in a few months when I
32:06 - know a little more
32:10 - um so NY yeah not every stream that I do
32:14 - is this high level so some of them are
32:17 - really like basic uh CSS changes or
32:20 - basic JavaScript HTML stuff so um just
32:23 - check out uh if you want like you can
32:26 - follow follow me on Twitter and or
32:29 - subscribe to the free code Camp Channel
32:31 - and then you'll get alerts saying what
32:34 - topic I'm going to be working on each
32:36 - day and maybe there will be a topic
32:38 - that'll be more like at at your level
32:40 - where you're at right now I'm also going
32:42 - to be doing some beginner videos and
32:46 - putting them on my own YouTube channel
32:48 - which is linked in the description so
32:51 - you can check that out as well uh and
32:53 - maybe if you want to subscribe it you
32:56 - don't have to subscribe my channel but
32:57 - you'll get the benefit of being alerted
32:59 - when I do upload those uh I think um
33:03 - since I'll be on vacation next next week
33:05 - I'm going to be at the beach but it's
33:06 - looking like there's going to be some
33:07 - rain so maybe I'll try to get some of
33:10 - those videos done then and so maybe
33:13 - they'll be posted next week uh I think
33:16 - that would be nice since I might not be
33:17 - able to live stream if the internet's
33:18 - down at least May or if the internet's
33:21 - not good enough at least maybe I can
33:22 - upload some of those pre-recorded videos
33:26 - and those are going to be initially
33:28 - aimed at like people who are just
33:36 - beginning all right a high says Noy you
33:39 - will get there I used to be in your
33:40 - shoes eight months ago now I'm
33:42 - interviewing for four companies awesome
33:44 - uh aim high congratulations on that
33:47 - that's that's really uh really awesome
33:50 - to hear um let let me know let us know
33:53 - if you get if you get a job from any of
33:55 - the uh companies
33:57 - I'd love to hear the good news so uh
33:59 - good luck with
34:04 - that uh someone from Orlando sends their
34:06 - greetings hello from Nigeria
34:11 - awesome uh Andrew says if you get in the
34:13 - industry and you're good it escalates
34:16 - quickly so good advice yeah just you
34:19 - know get in there and give it a
34:24 - shot a high says uh it yeah mainly uh
34:30 - free code
34:31 - camp but supplement my learning with you
34:34 - Demi okay
34:35 - so awesome resources obviously free code
34:39 - Camp because if you're here you know
34:41 - about free code camp but Udi also $10
34:43 - courses I have done I did a course from
34:46 - udmi before uh that was like one of
34:49 - those $10 courses and I did like it it
34:51 - was useful I know you if you've heard me
34:53 - before say I don't think I've spent more
34:55 - than like $30 on course coures um
34:58 - learning this
34:59 - stuff but uh udmi was one of the places
35:03 - that I did spend money on and uh I was I
35:06 - was happy with with the
35:08 - course noi says uh learning with
35:14 - Treehouse Treehouse is nice I've looked
35:17 - at treeh house and stuff and um and it
35:20 - looked nice I haven't done that much
35:21 - with it but uh maybe if if anyone
35:24 - watching has some experience with treeh
35:25 - house too and wants to comment about it
35:27 - from what I understand it it seems like
35:29 - it's a pretty good
35:32 - resource um we have someone from
35:35 - Russia
35:39 - awesome so um LOL LOL asks hey Jesse how
35:44 - big is your company how many employees
35:46 - uh we
35:47 - have like 500 employees I think so I
35:51 - work at a
35:53 - university um a university here in the
35:55 - United States and it's a small
35:58 - University so we don't have maybe like
36:02 - 2,000 students so that's that's
36:06 - considered a pretty small um
36:09 - university and we have I think about 500
36:12 - employees and that that includes the
36:15 - professors uh as well so the staff and
36:18 - the faculty combined are about about
36:21 - 500 uh and my particular I I actually
36:24 - work in the marketing department and we
36:26 - we have in my entire department I think
36:29 - it's only about 15 people and my my
36:32 - division within my department there's
36:34 - only three of us uh and only two of us
36:38 - actually do any code so so it's really
36:41 - kind of small I guess that we really
36:43 - only have two people doing code and uh
36:46 - we we almost never even work on the same
36:48 - project because we're just kind of
36:49 - really swamped with projects all the
36:51 - time so I'm usually working by myself as
36:55 - I mentioned earlier I am getting some
36:57 - student workers and maybe I'm trying to
36:59 - set up some internship stuff too maybe
37:01 - for the fall uh so hopefully I'll have
37:04 - some more people working I would really
37:07 - love to have the student workers
37:08 - involved so they can get some good
37:09 - experience uh in using you know GitHub
37:13 - and some more modern build tools and
37:15 - things and get some good experience to
37:17 - put on their portfolio I think that
37:19 - would be
37:20 - awesome so anyway I guess that's you
37:24 - know kind of small small company small
37:26 - University
37:27 - uh we have hello from India
37:33 - awesome noi says what I can stay away
37:37 - from using semicolon and JS yeah who
37:40 - knew right I only recently found that
37:42 - out I guess I'm behind the game though
37:44 - which is I mean that happens if you if
37:47 - you stay off Twitter for a while it's
37:49 - easy to fall
37:50 - behind
37:52 - um aim high says
37:55 - um well it says Noy follow me on on
37:58 - codepen uh just go to codepen and search
38:01 - my username so I don't I don't know if a
38:05 - high meant for me to uh give the
38:09 - username out loud so I'm not so uh I'll
38:13 - just leave it out if you want if you
38:15 - don't mind and you want me to read out
38:16 - your username so people can check out
38:18 - your code pen let me know and I I will
38:20 - do
38:21 - it Rohan prefers the
38:25 - semicolon and LOL LOL also prefers
38:30 - so okay so we have some some debate here
38:34 - about the semicolon I prefer the
38:36 - semicolon simply because I'm familiar
38:38 - with it I'm used to using it but I
38:40 - imagine it will be better if I just get
38:43 - rid of the semicolon that way it's just
38:46 - one less thing I have to worry about one
38:48 - less thing I have to
38:50 - do uh I'm sure it will speed up my my
38:54 - coding ever so slightly but over the
38:56 - long long term that'll probably add up
38:58 - and it'll save me
38:59 - like 10 minutes of time
39:03 - which which would be important I
39:06 - guess
39:09 - um Patrick says I really prefer one ve
39:13 - let or const with commas is there a way
39:15 - to disable that yeah actually so if if
39:18 - you're you're not sure what he's
39:19 - referring to uh we
39:22 - had this comparison
39:25 - here where was it
39:28 - oh okay here so we um when we use
39:34 - prettier or I'm sorry when we use uh
39:37 - standard JS to lint this it said that I
39:41 - had to change this from using this V and
39:44 - just using One V and defining multiple
39:47 - variables to putting each variable being
39:51 - defined with its own V on a separate
39:54 - line there and uh
39:57 - Patrick ask if that can be disabled I'm
39:59 - pretty sure it can there's anything that
40:01 - you can do in es lent in terms of
40:03 - disabling or customizing you can do with
40:05 - standard JS because it's using ES lent
40:09 - uh in the
40:12 - background and if worse comes to worse
40:15 - you could just add in like in a comment
40:17 - tag disable uh es
40:20 - lent if you wanted to and just disable
40:23 - that portion that's that's kind of like
40:26 - would be a pain to have to do that all
40:27 - the time but if you really wanted to
40:29 - that that would
40:31 - work uh Andrew says Jesse have any
40:34 - experience with browser extension so you
40:37 - mean like making a browser extension if
40:39 - if you mean making a browser extension
40:42 - then no I've never actually made my own
40:44 - browser
40:45 - extension uh I have been interested in
40:47 - doing it at times in the past but I just
40:50 - never really like had had the time or
40:52 - like a real need to do
40:55 - it uh but but also at least for my
40:59 - purposes if I wanted to make a browser
41:01 - extension that could do something I it's
41:03 - easier for me to use something like
41:05 - tamper monkey which I do use and then
41:08 - just write the code in tamper monkey and
41:11 - apply
41:12 - it so I kind of get around having to
41:15 - really learn how to make a browser
41:16 - extension and I can still get done what
41:18 - I want to get done
41:20 - so um but otherwise I don't have any
41:23 - direct experience with making uh a
41:25 - browser
41:27 - attention all right we have someone from
41:29 - Palestine
41:33 - welcome
41:37 - and sorry it keeps uh for some reason
41:40 - normally it doesn't do this but today in
41:42 - the live chat I don't know why but I
41:43 - keep getting bounced down to the bottom
41:45 - of the chat so I keep losing my
41:52 - place all right so okay Palestine
41:55 - someone from mov
41:57 - um oh Andrew from malova awesome I have
42:01 - um my my wife has some nieces and
42:03 - nephews and actually one of them is my
42:06 - goddaughter uh who were adopted from
42:08 - mova uh
42:10 - so
42:13 - awesome Nigeria
42:19 - welcome uh daff derp asks are you done
42:22 - uh yeah actually so I know it's it's
42:25 - it's way early right it's I've only been
42:27 - on for 40 minutes so and at the time
42:29 - when you asked that it was I'd only been
42:31 - on for half an hour so yeah basically
42:33 - with for the topic of the the stream I'm
42:37 - done with that so um I know we had
42:40 - talked about doing shorter streams so
42:42 - I'm I'm making an effort to do shorter
42:45 - streams um if you if you missed if
42:48 - you're just coming in and you missed it
42:50 - the replay will be available on free
42:52 - code Camp um just a few minutes after I
42:55 - end the the stream so uh you can watch
42:58 - the
43:02 - replay Andrew says today I made some big
43:05 - rebases and merges had to remove some
43:07 - big files from entire repository history
43:10 - 386 commits wow that's crazy uh
43:13 - yesterday we did a um a stream on doing
43:18 - merges of pool requests and stuff so uh
43:21 - wow that seems
43:23 - like I mean I don't know maybe I don't
43:26 - know what to compare that to but that
43:28 - really seems like a lot of of commits to
43:30 - be working with
43:32 - there um Yong asks where do you deploy
43:36 - the website AWS it's actually digital
43:38 - ocean all right Ro Rohan answered that
43:40 - so yeah digital ocean we do here at the
43:42 - University we have three different hosts
43:44 - right well actually four different hosts
43:46 - the main website which is franciscan.edu
43:49 - is actually hosted here on campus and
43:51 - the IT department runs their own
43:54 - physical servers there okay that that is
43:56 - actually going to change soon and we're
43:58 - going to when we redesign the site which
44:00 - will be like probably the next really
44:02 - major project that I do um I'll do a lot
44:06 - of little projects in between when I
44:08 - start that one but we host that there we
44:11 - host some sites on GoDaddy so we just
44:14 - have like a little shared Hosting
44:16 - account that we just do some really
44:17 - minor stuff with uh but it's easy to
44:20 - it's nice to have because you can do
44:21 - like the oneclick five minute WordPress
44:23 - install and have something going and so
44:26 - um we also host on digital ocean and we
44:29 - have a site on
44:33 - AWS all right we have uh someone from
44:36 - Mexico
44:48 - awesome all right no said thanks Jesse
44:50 - you're
44:54 - welcome all right looks look like
44:56 - somebody was talking about getting
44:57 - discounts on udmi courses and uh mobin
45:01 - 92 says you can go to real. Discount
45:04 - I've never been there so I'm not
45:05 - endorsing the site because I don't I
45:06 - don't know what's on there but uh I
45:08 - guess there's discounts for stuff on
45:11 - there
45:13 - um I'm not sure how to pronounce most of
45:17 - this name but it ends with Isaac and I
45:20 - know how to pronounce Isaac so I'm I'm
45:21 - sorry I just didn't want to mess up your
45:23 - name so I didn't want to attempt it but
45:25 - says which would you advise becoming a
45:27 - full stack developer or front-end
45:29 - developer I
45:33 - um one day I would like to know enough
45:35 - about the backend to be able to say I'm
45:37 - full
45:38 - stack right now I'm only comfortable
45:40 - saying that that I'm front end and my
45:44 - idea was well I'll start with front end
45:47 - and make money with that and then slowly
45:50 - work my way to learn everything learn
45:52 - the back end and be full stack so that
45:54 - was my idea and that's how I wanted to
45:56 - do it I will say if you start from the
45:58 - outset saying I want to be full stack
46:00 - you'll probably get there sooner for me
46:04 - I just had a family you know I need to
46:05 - take care of and I need to pay the bills
46:07 - so it was like okay I'm going to start
46:09 - out because I know I can get money doing
46:12 - frontend work right now uh so I haven't
46:15 - made it to full stack as quickly as I
46:17 - had hoped just because I'm busy you know
46:20 - doing my job as doing front end stuff so
46:23 - it kind of depends on what you want def
46:26 - it's easier to become a front-end
46:27 - developer than a full stack it'll take
46:29 - less time so if you really need to kind
46:31 - of get into it and start making money
46:33 - with It Go Front End first and then
46:34 - learn the rest but if you have the time
46:37 - to just dedicate to learning uh Go full
46:40 - stack and then you'll make more money as
46:41 - a full stack developer uh most likely uh
46:45 - anyway
46:47 - so that's my advice maybe you all in the
46:49 - live chat have some better advice than
46:51 - that or some alternate opinions
46:53 - but uh that's that's kind of my
46:56 - viewpoint on
46:58 - it uh okay there someone from Wales
47:01 - awesome
47:04 - hello Andrew says with time you will be
47:07 - full stack even if you don't want it and
47:10 - uh that's that's kind of true I'm sure
47:12 - Andrew was joking a little bit but that
47:14 - that is actually kind of true if you'll
47:15 - see like if you've watched any of my
47:17 - streams before occasionally I'm doing
47:19 - stuff that's definitely not front-end
47:22 - even though I'm a front-end developer
47:24 - and especially if you're on a small team
47:27 - or
47:27 - freelancing yeah you're going to have to
47:30 - to learn a lot of stuff eventually so um
47:35 - yeah I I mean probably most of us even
47:38 - if we're doing mostly frontend stuff
47:39 - occasionally do have to do backend stuff
47:41 - from time to time so it wouldn't be that
47:43 - much of a jump for us to just do some
47:44 - more learning and and jump in and and be
47:47 - doing full stack not to say that it's
47:49 - easy to be full stack but just to say
47:51 - that that's a natural
47:54 - progression all right have someone from
47:56 - Brazil awesome
47:59 - hello
48:02 - um Andrew says semicolons are noise for
48:05 - me all right so Andrew Andrew is um
48:08 - against semicolons and we have what
48:11 - Rohan and Patrick are on team
48:16 - semicolon Rohan says you could do
48:18 - backend exclusively or networking or
48:21 - full stack it's just what you like yeah
48:23 - I didn't even mention that yeah uh
48:26 - I guess it depends on what you like
48:27 - doing if you don't like doing backend
48:29 - stuff then don't try to be full stack uh
48:32 - if you just like front end stick with
48:33 - that because that's important uh you
48:36 - know you don't want to be stuck doing
48:37 - something that you don't
48:40 - like Rohan says for example I get bored
48:43 - easily with one thing so I would prefer
48:45 - full
48:46 - stack Andrew says or what the company
48:48 - has for you to work yeah that's that's
48:50 - important too you know if you get a job
48:52 - doing one or the other then that's
48:54 - that's what you're G to do
49:00 - Rohan uh said with small to medium
49:02 - companies you are usually you usually
49:04 - are overworked but you do get to try
49:06 - lots of stuff
49:09 - yeah I can understand that bro so that's
49:13 - that's where I'm at right now exactly
49:15 - small company overworked but I do get to
49:18 - do a lot of stuff so I will say this
49:21 - normally my schedule is nice I don't
49:24 - work a lot it's just been crazy for the
49:26 - last month or so so hopefully I can get
49:29 - back to my normal working hours and it
49:32 - won't be so
49:33 - crazy all
49:38 - right Sebastian says I'm Romanian but
49:40 - for the past 8 to9 years have been
49:42 - living in Spain
49:45 - awesome Andrew uh Andrew said he had a
49:49 - year in a company and during that year
49:52 - tried Java schola PHP as a back language
49:56 - and even wrote SQL so definitely a lot
49:59 - of stuff just to do in in one
50:04 - year okay the es lint rule for
50:06 - repetitive ver is one one ve so if
50:11 - you're interested in learning how to get
50:13 - around uh this being able to do this
50:17 - instead of being forced to do this with
50:18 - the es lent the rule is one there so you
50:21 - could disable one there right um or or
50:25 - enable I'm not I forget how that works
50:27 - but basically look up in the docs uh you
50:30 - know do a control fine for one bear
50:32 - that's what you want it's what you want
50:33 - to look
50:38 - for uh Rohan rohan's commenting on the
50:41 - length of the video when I was talking
50:42 - about that that we went from like 2.7
50:45 - hours to 30 minutes big difference so
50:47 - definitely cut it on this video is going
50:49 - to end up being an hour after we get
50:50 - through the Q&A but the actual like I
50:53 - want to say not that I did any coding
50:55 - today today but what would normally be
50:56 - the coding portion was only 25 minutes
50:59 - which may be a
51:01 - record I think in my early streams I I
51:04 - kept it pretty short but that's
51:07 - definitely short compared to what we've
51:08 - been doing uh Joshua asks what UI
51:11 - Library do you like to use with react
51:14 - I've been having trouble with the at bar
51:16 - on material
51:17 - UI uh
51:19 - so for this project I actually use
51:22 - materialize just their regular framework
51:26 - and I've had to adapt things to react at
51:30 - times so uh I don't know that I
51:32 - recommend doing normally I do recommend
51:35 - materialize I really like that framework
51:37 - I've used it a lot and I'm familiar with
51:40 - their all their conventions of like
51:42 - class names and things so it's easy for
51:44 - me to build things rapidly with
51:47 - materialize but I am going to need to
51:50 - switch now that most of what I'm doing
51:52 - is in react I think I'm going to need to
51:54 - switch to something that is is more
51:55 - react specific so I know there is uh
52:00 - someone linked I can't remember maybe it
52:04 - was vet maybe yesterday linked uh
52:07 - to a set of react components that were
52:11 - based on the materialized framework so
52:13 - I'm going to have to check those out I
52:15 - know there's material UI there's
52:16 - material
52:18 - MD or no is it react MD I think I still
52:22 - I must have closed the tab but there was
52:25 - is a uh another material design style
52:28 - react framework that's out there as well
52:30 - and it was MD something
52:33 - um so I don't I don't have a react like
52:38 - component library to recommend to you
52:42 - uh but I mean I have used materialized
52:45 - with react and it's basically worked
52:47 - without without too many issues even
52:50 - though it's not really made for react
52:54 - components
52:58 - Andrew has some good advice uh when for
53:00 - when we were talking about commits and
53:02 - everything uh get commits says when you
53:04 - remove something from the entire
53:06 - repository history every commit changes
53:08 - hashes so you have to be careful and
53:10 - announce to all team members yeah uh
53:14 - definitely keep that in mind when you're
53:16 - trying to decide like what how you're
53:18 - going to merge
53:19 - things and
53:22 - um if you're making changes to your
53:24 - commits
53:27 - how is that going to affect your other
53:29 - team if it's just you then you could
53:31 - pretty much do whatever you want I guess
53:32 - and it won't really matter but if you
53:33 - have a team of people submitting pool
53:36 - requests and all working on the project
53:37 - then uh you you don't want to mess
53:40 - everything up for them so decide on
53:43 - beforehand I guess on how you're going
53:45 - to handle things like that with your
53:47 - team uh V asked did you check now.sh for
53:51 - hosting actually I I went to a
53:53 - conference where they demonstrated how
53:55 - to use now uh to get a site up and
53:57 - running and you can even buy domain
53:59 - names right through the command line it
54:00 - was really awesome and quick so I am
54:03 - familiar with using
54:05 - that uh I think I think I would like to
54:09 - use it at some point I mean obviously
54:11 - not for this project we already have
54:13 - everything set up uh but possibly for
54:16 - some smaller projects I would like to do
54:18 - that um I'm not sure like I mean
54:21 - obviously we're doing some low balancing
54:23 - and we have this running on multiple
54:24 - servers
54:25 - and then there's so there's a lot more
54:27 - going on here but I think there will be
54:31 - some smaller sites that I'll be working
54:33 - on in the near future I think that would
54:36 - be a good candidate for trying that out
54:39 - uh I'll have to look into the pricing as
54:40 - well because obviously I would want to
54:43 - use if I'm doing this officially for my
54:46 - job we're going to be using a you know a
54:48 - custom domain and I think if you use
54:50 - your own domain at that
54:52 - point you have to be using I I don't
54:55 - remember the pricing structure but uh
54:57 - anyway I'll have to check the only thing
54:59 - basically I need to look into is the
55:00 - pricing and to see if it would make
55:01 - sense to do it like that but otherwise
55:03 - I'm very impressed with using now uh for
55:08 - hosting so if you're not familiar with
55:10 - that the same people that do nextjs
55:13 - which is the basically kind of I don't I
55:16 - don't know what the right term for it is
55:17 - but like the scaffolding for that I'm
55:20 - using to build with
55:22 - react that same those same people do now
55:27 - which is a way to very easily deploy
55:30 - straight from the command line uh right
55:32 - to hosting and uh it's it's just it's so
55:35 - simple uh you know definitely check it
55:37 - out I don't want to spend a lot of time
55:39 - describing what I saw at this conference
55:41 - because you could probably just find the
55:43 - video a video of it or check it out for
55:45 - yourself and see but I mean literally as
55:47 - I mentioned you you can do as much as
55:49 - even buy a domain name right from the
55:51 - command line and in a few commands have
55:53 - a completely new website up and running
55:55 - with your own custom domain and an SSL
55:58 - and all that uh it's really really uh
56:01 - kind of slick and uh nice
56:06 - process
56:08 - um noi says uh LOL Jesse I'm following
56:12 - the same footsteps I'm focusing on front
56:14 - end then later on back end but I want to
56:16 - get my foot in with front end yeah I I
56:18 - mean I don't think it's a bad like I
56:20 - said it depends on what you need you
56:22 - what point in life you're and what you
56:23 - need I mean for me it just like I didn't
56:27 - have time to just spend a lot of time
56:29 - studying and and dedicate my time to
56:32 - that I needed to make money like
56:34 - literally I had quit a
56:36 - job and I was looking for work and
56:39 - couldn't find work and I needed to make
56:42 - money and learn something so I caught a
56:44 - break and a friend of mine had a
56:47 - marketing company that needed some
56:49 - website work someone to do website work
56:52 - and you know I was getting some work on
56:54 - the side with them
56:56 - and the only the way for me to get even
56:58 - more work was to learn this stuff
57:00 - so that that was what just what I needed
57:03 - to do um because I I had a family I had
57:06 - to pay bills so if I had to do it again
57:08 - maybe I would have and I I was
57:11 - completely single with not a lot of
57:14 - responsibilities maybe I would have
57:16 - tried to like just dedicate a bunch of
57:18 - time to just learning and be you know be
57:21 - full stack but uh either way I think is
57:24 - is definitely respectable legitimate way
57:26 - of going it just depends on what you
57:29 - need uh Matt says it pays to spend the
57:32 - time to really learn one aspect first
57:35 - okay so awesome yeah something to be
57:37 - said for focusing I guess on on focusing
57:39 - your attention on one thing uh Sebastian
57:42 - asks where should I start looking for
57:44 - work as a front-end Dev uh and we have
57:47 - some answers in the live chat I'll read
57:49 - them out Rohan says oh this isn't an
57:52 - answer to that question uh Andrew says
57:54 - stack over flow so yeah definitely stack
57:56 - Overflow has this whole job uh board
57:59 - that's that's really
58:01 - awesome so let me bring this
58:04 - up just in in case I'm sure most of you
58:07 - are familiar with stack Overflow but if
58:08 - you haven't seen the jobs yet there you
58:11 - see the jobs right here right and they
58:14 - they will show you jobs based on what
58:16 - you searched for on stack Overflow like
58:18 - assuming you have an account and
58:19 - everything and uh and they have your
58:22 - data and uh usually like they awesome
58:25 - jobs like you know check this out
58:26 - front-end developer 90 to 130k that's
58:30 - insane that's that's a lot of money um
58:34 - way more than than I make uh so you know
58:37 - if you check it out you get lots of
58:40 - details about the job right there you
58:42 - know so I would just check it out check
58:45 - out there and then it's as simple as
58:48 - this and you get a lot of other related
58:51 - jobs I've been really impressed with
58:53 - stacker overflow we're actually
58:55 - advertising uh a position here at this
58:58 - University for a web developer on stack
59:00 - Overflow right now uh and I was really
59:03 - the one who pushed for like we need to
59:05 - list on stack Overflow because I was so
59:07 - impressed with how they do things uh and
59:11 - and how they suggest jobs to to people
59:14 - uh I thought that was kind of
59:17 - really really like no other site has has
59:20 - that kind of data and that user base um
59:23 - to be able to do what overflow jobs does
59:25 - so if you're looking to get like a
59:27 - full-time job definitely do that if you
59:29 - want to just find freelance work then
59:32 - networking with people directly I found
59:34 - to be way better than going on one of
59:36 - the freelance job sites the jobs I got
59:39 - from those sites were usually not very
59:41 - high paying and they didn't they didn't
59:44 - amount to much like I didn't get like
59:47 - repeat clients or a lot of good leads
59:48 - from there that was just my experience
59:51 - uh the better clients were were personal
59:54 - connection
59:55 - and I would have a client that they were
59:56 - really impressed with what I did and
59:58 - then they recommended me to other people
60:00 - they knew and then it just kind of grew
60:02 - my like freelance business grew
60:04 - naturally like that so it takes a little
60:06 - while but those clients were were repeat
60:09 - clients and they were great to work with
60:13 - uh so that I had a better experience
60:14 - with
60:19 - that
60:23 - um
60:25 - we had some there was some uh discussion
60:28 - more about whether to go full stack or
60:30 - front end first Rohan prefers networking
60:33 - in backend but hasn't really had a real
60:35 - job yet so uh don't doesn't really know
60:38 - for sure Matt says better to focus in
60:40 - One Direction or uh or the other and
60:44 - that leads to deeper understanding in
60:46 - one spot yeah definitely I mean if if
60:47 - you force yourself to focus you're going
60:49 - to be way better at that one thing than
60:50 - you ever would have if you didn't uh
60:53 - there's a quote from somebody I have no
60:55 - idea who it was but I read a book before
60:57 - and uh they were saying that to be great
61:00 - at something you have to say no to
61:02 - everything else right so you you have to
61:06 - focus on that one thing uh if you want
61:08 - to be as great as you possibly can at
61:10 - that one thing even though you could be
61:13 - great at at lots of different things if
61:14 - you would have choose to do those things
61:17 - uh you have to focus on one if if you
61:19 - want to be really good so I definitely
61:21 - agree with that I mean I'm there are
61:22 - some really talented people that are
61:23 - Greatful developers but even then if
61:26 - they would have focused all their
61:28 - attention I think on on one area they
61:31 - could have been even better at that one
61:33 - area than they already are uh so but I
61:37 - mean you need you need people of all you
61:39 - need some people that don't want to
61:41 - focus and want to have a more broad
61:43 - understanding uh so and
61:46 - there's there are jobs for all different
61:48 - types of people depending on what you
61:50 - want to do if you want to focus or if
61:51 - you want to be have a more general
61:53 - knowledge of more things
61:59 - uh Zachary says it feels like the line
62:01 - between front and back end is so blurred
62:03 - in the JS
62:05 - world I I agree there there's definitely
62:07 - some blurring there I mean because
62:09 - you're running JavaScript on client side
62:11 - and server side uh so it it feels a lot
62:15 - of it does feel the same like when I
62:17 - switch
62:18 - over like you know I'm doing front-end
62:21 - stuff basically but you know I have this
62:24 - this server.js file like have have I now
62:27 - switched to the backend world just with
62:29 - one click here like it's still all the
62:32 - same thing I'm using const I'm I'm using
62:34 - JavaScript like it it is it does feel
62:37 - weird sometimes um you know like where
62:41 - where is that that line
62:45 - but uh but anyway I mean like I said I I
62:47 - think most of what I do is front-end so
62:50 - it's clear in my mind that I'm a
62:51 - front-end developer uh even though I do
62:54 - backend stuff
62:58 - occasionally uh Blazer Tron all right so
63:00 - we're back to the semicolon debate
63:02 - Blazer Tron says learning the basics of
63:04 - JS but I'd rather use semicolons mainly
63:06 - because I've been told that yeah I'm in
63:08 - the same boat that's I I don't I'm I'm
63:11 - probably going to try not to use
63:13 - semicolons as much as possible and
63:15 - certainly now that it's going to
63:16 - automatically take them out for me I'm
63:17 - not going to have them but um yeah I've
63:21 - always been told use semicolon so it is
63:23 - kind of a weird thing although learning
63:24 - to use react was the same way cuz you've
63:26 - always been
63:27 - told don't put your CSS in line and mix
63:31 - it with with your HTML and then we come
63:34 - to react and we have JavaScript HTML and
63:37 - CSS all mixed together right it just
63:40 - seems
63:41 - weird once you get used to it it's
63:44 - actually really nice uh but it's hard at
63:52 - first uh person it seems like the live
63:56 - chat the is like a NeverEnding um chat
64:00 - today so which is great it looks like we
64:02 - have some great discussion going on here
64:04 - so I'm going to keep yeah I I'd say
64:07 - probably we can get through this in
64:08 - about 10 minutes so about 10 minutes I'm
64:10 - going to end uh so I can kind of get
64:13 - move on to uh do some some other work
64:16 - that is probably boring and I don't even
64:18 - don't want to put on a live stream um so
64:22 - if you got a question get it in in about
64:23 - 10 minutes I can't get all the questions
64:25 - then uh please put them in the um uh in
64:29 - the
64:30 - comments or direct message me on Twitter
64:33 - and I will answer them so person asks
64:37 - how long have you been learning I've
64:39 - been learning for the past year and it
64:40 - feels like I'm not progressing
64:42 - anywhere I've been learning this for a
64:44 - long
64:46 - time I first learned how to build
64:49 - websites in 2003 somewhere around there
64:52 - and that was just basic stuff we we just
64:54 - opened up notepad on on a PC and started
64:58 - doing basic HTML and CSS and doing
65:01 - layout with tables and things like that
65:03 - uh
65:05 - so but I I didn't really do that much
65:07 - with it after that so I would
65:10 - say I've only really been like intensely
65:14 - trying to learn JavaScript in particular
65:17 - for like maybe the
65:21 - last four years five years I I don't
65:25 - even want to say five like maybe maybe
65:27 - the last three or four years have I
65:29 - really been focused on getting better at
65:31 - JavaScript before that I was doing
65:33 - websites but I was I wasn't like
65:36 - intentionally saying I want to get
65:38 - really good with JavaScript it was more
65:40 - I was focusing more on CSS at that point
65:44 - so I'd say three years of of more
65:46 - intense Focus uh to get where I'm at
65:49 - right
65:51 - now uh so don't don't be discouraged if
65:55 - it feels like you're not
65:57 - progressing it doesn't always go uh
66:01 - sometimes you learn a lot really fast
66:02 - and you feel awesome and then you work
66:05 - for a long time and it feels like you're
66:06 - not getting anywhere uh and then you'll
66:09 - hit another like spurt like a gross
66:11 - spurt right remember when when we were
66:13 - kids and you
66:15 - just like you'd go to have summer break
66:18 - and you'd come back to school and some
66:19 - people would be like Giants and cuz they
66:22 - hit a gross SP right the same thing
66:23 - happen and coding that's probably a
66:25 - terrible analogy but uh the same thing
66:28 - does happen with coding like all of a
66:30 - sudden you just like it seems like
66:32 - things are just all making sense and you
66:37 - you just get really good and and then
66:39 - you'll hit another Plateau you'll have a
66:41 - point where it doesn't seem like you're
66:43 - progressing but just because it doesn't
66:45 - seem like you're
66:46 - progressing like you you are you're
66:48 - learning things you're retaining things
66:50 - it just needs to fit together uh for for
66:54 - you so uh if this is something you
66:56 - really want to do and you enjoy doing
66:58 - doing then stick with it don't get
67:01 - discouraged uh I'm constantly looking
67:04 - back at things I did even a few months
67:05 - ago and saying wow like I I definitely
67:08 - would do it differently now I've I've
67:09 - learn you know I've gotten better uh so
67:12 - and you you'll get there you'll have a
67:13 - bunch of those
67:16 - moments Patrick is going back to the
67:19 - semicolon thing Patrick does not care
67:21 - about semicolons like in and of
67:23 - themselves but more about consistency so
67:26 - if you're doing Simple JS with no
67:28 - tooling preventing you uh from then use
67:31 - semicolons if so I guess use whatever
67:34 - you're used to using if you don't have
67:36 - tooling to make it consistent for you so
67:39 - that that seems to be Patrick's Point
67:41 - there which is a good
67:43 - point
67:45 - um person clarified uh the question a
67:49 - little bit but I think I I answered that
67:52 - Matt Matt response to person says it
67:55 - starts slow but it can really pick up
67:57 - find some projects doing something you
67:59 - enjoy and it will pick up fast the more
68:02 - you enjoy it the easier it will be for
68:04 - you to spend more time with your head in
68:06 - it good advice Matt uh in person ask any
68:11 - projects you recommend I'd love to work
68:13 - on
68:14 - some
68:17 - so
68:19 - H I don't I don't know what your level
68:22 - is out in terms of project
68:24 - I know there are some websites that just
68:26 - have project ideas I don't remember what
68:29 - the addresses are for those sites now
68:31 - but I'm sure if you kind of search for
68:33 - that concept you'll find some uh you
68:36 - could also try you know some of the like
68:39 - coding tutorials have projects you could
68:41 - work on like free code Camp if you
68:44 - haven't gone through free code Camp
68:46 - stuff there are a lot of projects and
68:49 - you don't have to go through everything
68:50 - to get there first you could just pick
68:51 - one out and try it if you want just to
68:53 - get an idea
68:55 - or you can sometimes I just ask people
68:58 - like friends and family like hey if do
69:00 - you have any good ideas for websites or
69:02 - apps or anything like that and see if
69:05 - there's a good idea uh that they have
69:08 - that you could work on especially if
69:10 - they're not coders then they're
69:12 - obviously never going to do that they're
69:14 - they're never going to use their ideas
69:15 - so there uh they'd probably be really
69:17 - happy if you Tred to make their idea uh
69:20 - really
69:22 - happen
69:26 - uh Noy says Hey Jesse I just installed
69:28 - standard and the bracket brackets
69:31 - extension is that
69:35 - it okay so I I'm all right so I don't
69:40 - use brackets so I'm just assuming that
69:42 - it's similar enough to adom that this
69:44 - would work so you'll need
69:48 - to if you're using the extension then
69:51 - that should give you the warnings
69:54 - right there so yeah that should work you
69:56 - should as long as you're seeing the uh
69:58 - the warnings about syntax in in your
70:02 - editor then you're good to go it may not
70:05 - work exactly like mine's working where
70:07 - it like automatically uh checks
70:09 - everything as soon as I get a do a
70:13 - commit uh so that part you might need to
70:17 - set up differently but if you just want
70:19 - like the linting in editor then you
70:21 - should be good to go
70:24 - somebody who maybe uses brackets might
70:26 - be able if if you're in the live chat
70:29 - now maybe you'll be able to give some
70:30 - better uh more specific
70:40 - advice all right Andrew has good advice
70:42 - uh kind of along the lines with what I
70:44 - was my saying my experience was was
70:46 - check your code from one year ago and if
70:49 - you feel it needs Improvement then then
70:51 - you've grown that's great advice yeah if
70:53 - if you look at code you did from an
70:55 - earlier time and you notice things like
70:58 - oh I I should have done this differently
71:00 - or I can correct that then you know
71:02 - you've learned you know you've improved
71:04 - because obviously when you wrote it you
71:07 - didn't know enough to make it the right
71:10 - way like it should have been so great
71:15 - advice Matt says about two years ago I
71:18 - went on a family vacation to Alaska and
71:20 - to share pictures I set up a website to
71:22 - upload and display photo
71:24 - videos uh think like private Facebook
71:27 - yeah that's a really good idea so that
71:30 - that's a good idea of uh a project to do
71:33 - uh you know if you're interested in
71:36 - something like
71:37 - that thanks for that I I really like
71:39 - that idea I might Matt I might do that
71:43 - that might be a legit idea for me to
71:45 - work on on vacation and not have
71:48 - everybody be mad at me for working on
71:50 - vacation because I'm actually doing
71:52 - something that will contribute to the
71:55 - vacation so that's good I I'm I'm going
71:57 - to share a little personal thing right
71:59 - here uh I hope you don't mind but my
72:02 - wife's I'm going on vacation with all my
72:04 - wife's side of the family so her
72:05 - brothers and their wives and their kids
72:07 - and my mother and father-in-law and some
72:10 - of her aunts and and and her uncles so
72:13 - all her side of the family they're very
72:15 - creative and like musically talented so
72:18 - there's always like these times where
72:21 - like okay we're going to have like a
72:22 - talent night like everybody write a
72:23 - story and we're going to read it out to
72:25 - him or uh we're going to we're going to
72:27 - play songs or music and I have no
72:29 - musical ability at all I really like
72:32 - music I like to listen to music but I I
72:35 - can't make music I'm not a good singer
72:38 - like nothing and uh when I hear like I
72:42 - got an email saying we're going to do
72:44 - like a contest about writing a story on
72:46 - vacation and I get like anxiety over
72:49 - that like I don't really want to write
72:50 - the story and to me I'm like can can I
72:53 - just make a website would that work
72:57 - because that makes me excited but the
72:59 - other stuff makes me have anxiety so the
73:03 - the reason why I shared that was I'm
73:05 - thinking maybe instead of me
73:08 - contributing with some musical thing or
73:10 - a story my contribution could be some
73:13 - very useful website uh that can capture
73:17 - that family vacation and everybody can
73:19 - go to it and remember it so uh so Matt
73:23 - thanks for that idea because I might
73:25 - actually do that we'll see I don't want
73:28 - to work all a vacation I really do want
73:29 - to hang out with my family and and my
73:31 - kids but it would be nice to just code a
73:35 - little
73:36 - bit I don't know I just feel if I go for
73:39 - a long time without coding I feel weird
73:42 - like I miss it I don't does anybody else
73:44 - ever get that feeling uh on the negative
73:47 - side I I think like maybe I'm addicted
73:49 - to coding and this is a problem on the
73:52 - positive side I think hey do I found
73:54 - something that I really love to do uh so
73:57 - it could go one way or another depending
73:59 - on how you want to look at it but but
74:00 - I'm interested to see if anybody else
74:02 - feels like that let let me know I
74:05 - suspect somebody else has to feel like
74:07 - that I can't be I can't be the only one
74:11 - and if I am then maybe I do need to get
74:13 - some professional help need to need to
74:17 - talk to a counselor or
74:19 - something
74:21 - um Matt says in in regard to that site
74:24 - that Facebook like site um uh he worked
74:28 - with PHP HTML CSS and
74:32 - JavaScript and getting ready to rewrite
74:34 - it in D Jango uh so he says in my
74:38 - current role I am uh a DBA leading up
74:40 - ajango project to rewrite our main
74:42 - application
74:46 - awesome all right so Rohan says
74:48 - Improvement if I see code from 7 to 10
74:50 - months ago I feel like killing someone
74:52 - until I realized this was
74:55 - me that's great I I love that that
74:58 - sentiment right
75:00 - so I cringe when I look at old code
75:04 - occasionally I'm pleasantly surprised
75:05 - and I'm like oh this isn't as bad as I
75:07 - thought it would be but sometime usually
75:09 - I'm like I don't even want to look at it
75:12 - I just like all right this site still
75:14 - works like I'm just going to let it go I
75:16 - don't I don't want to revisit
75:19 - this uh pum says that's awesome I
75:22 - haven't had much inspiration
75:23 - and um Andrew I just checked my stuff
75:26 - from a year ago you're right there was
75:27 - definitely improvements thanks all right
75:29 - I'm I'm glad that that we could help um
75:32 - I definitely want this live chat and the
75:35 - community that's starting to develop
75:36 - around it to be a very like positive
75:38 - uplifting Community especially for
75:40 - people who are new uh I think that
75:42 - that's there's a lot of good tutorials
75:45 - and resources for new people uh and I
75:48 - want it to be like that but I think more
75:50 - importantly this could be a place of
75:52 - inspiration and encouragement uh for
75:55 - people that are just starting and for
75:57 - those of us you know that've been doing
75:58 - it for a little longer and maybe just
76:00 - kind of getting a little bit down about
76:02 - things so um that's something that I
76:05 - think you can't get from just reading a
76:07 - tutorial not necess you know you can't
76:08 - necessarily get that uh but in a more
76:11 - like active Living Community like this
76:14 - we can help each other out in that way
76:16 - and um at least for me that's that's if
76:20 - that happens if that's what this ends up
76:22 - being this stream and and all of you
76:25 - that watch and contribute if it ends up
76:27 - being a place that encourages people uh
76:30 - to learn how to code and continue in it
76:33 - uh then I'll be happy and I'll I'll
76:37 - be I'll be happy that I did sacrifice
76:40 - some of the time and the effort to do
76:47 - this uh daf der says what's a good
76:50 - resource for react convention Within in
76:53 - a large project I'm always confused on
76:55 - how much I should put into a single
76:57 - component um I'm sure
77:00 - that you probably get an answer
77:02 - somewhere but in the live chat for this
77:05 - uh dafter but I would say your
77:08 - components should be like as small as
77:10 - possible they should be only like one
77:12 - thing and you you may end up with a ton
77:14 - of components but it's been my
77:16 - understanding that the correct way to do
77:17 - things and react is that like if
77:20 - something can reasonably be broken down
77:22 - into a smaller component then do it uh
77:25 - and then that keeps them it keeps them
77:28 - small it keeps them easy to understand
77:30 - and more modular so that you can reuse
77:33 - them so uh does that make sense let me
77:35 - know if I need to explain that more if
77:37 - that didn't make sense or if if any of
77:39 - you disagree uh with that viewpoint but
77:41 - that's that's my understanding of of
77:43 - ideally how it should work when you're
77:45 - using
77:48 - react um let's see I'm looking we're
77:52 - getting bad
77:54 - yeah we we've hit definitely hit that 10
77:56 - minutes of where I said I wanted to end
77:58 - so I'm just going to look see if there's
78:00 - any like really important questions I
78:01 - want to get to especially from somebody
78:03 - who's new or maybe just learning uh
78:05 - because I definitely want to uh not that
78:07 - I don't appreciate all of you that are
78:08 - more experienced and and are in the live
78:11 - chat a lot but um I know you won't be
78:13 - offended if I don't get your question I
78:15 - don't want to I don't want to offend
78:16 - somebody if this is their first time
78:18 - asking a question and they get ignored
78:21 - so um let's see so Cactus asks what
78:26 - about markup developer what if you don't
78:30 - want to create markups but you have to
78:32 - do this front and Dev oh so like mockups
78:35 - so you're talking about design work
78:37 - right so uh Cactus correct me if I'm
78:39 - wrong but I think you're talking about
78:41 - design work like what if you have to do
78:44 - design work as a front-end Dev but you
78:46 - don't want to um well I would say either
78:50 - if you can talk to your your boss uh uh
78:53 - about it and see if maybe you can get a
78:55 - real designer or contract that out or
78:57 - something then do it otherwise I mean
78:59 - maybe look for another another job I do
79:02 - have to do design work even though I'm a
79:04 - front end
79:06 - developer I don't always like doing the
79:08 - design work especially at the beginning
79:10 - of a project when it's like a blank
79:12 - slate I'm always that's the worst part
79:14 - for me cuz I could I could make it look
79:17 - like anything you know so it's just hard
79:21 - to make a decision
79:23 - uh but I would imagine I mean how many
79:25 - people watching are front-end developers
79:27 - and also have to do design work uh I
79:30 - know I do for sure I imagine that's
79:33 - somewhat common depending on you know
79:35 - how big a company you work for so um but
79:38 - if if you definitely don't want to be
79:40 - doing that then I would recommend you
79:41 - know try to find a different job or try
79:43 - to bring that up you know in your team
79:46 - and and see if something else could be
79:48 - done you know you may have to keep doing
79:50 - it for a while until you can find
79:52 - something better but uh I mean I totally
79:54 - I'm in the same situation so I
79:56 - definitely understand
80:00 - that
80:03 - um let's
80:06 - see I'm just looking for questions right
80:17 - now usually I do read everything out and
80:20 - uh you all know that if you've seen it
80:21 - before so but
80:23 - um since this is going on pretty long
80:26 - that's why I'm skipping a little
80:30 - bit aim high asks uh hi Jesse so all
80:35 - what you are doing is caching on the
80:37 - server side all your routings on the
80:39 - front end um kind of so yeah basically
80:44 - the once the page
80:47 - loads uh so I did I have had the server
80:49 - up here for a while so what happens is
80:54 - nextjs has I'll go here and show you so
80:58 - in get initial props this fetch of the
81:02 - data happens on the server side so the
81:04 - initial page load and everything it all
81:07 - gets rendered server side and just the
81:09 - HTML you know is pushed out for search
81:12 - engine purposes that's that's good but
81:14 - once the page loads and you click on an
81:17 - internal link then you get no page
81:21 - refresh it's it is it's all client side
81:25 - um routing
81:27 - and the um the API calls that would
81:31 - normally be here and run on the server
81:33 - now can run on the client as well but I
81:37 - am doing a lot of caching so potentially
81:40 - those calls don't even get made if they
81:42 - don't need to so you can see like in the
81:46 - server like I'm caching it for an hour
81:50 - um not in when I'm development minute I
81:53 - don't cash it for an hour but so it's
81:54 - caching the rendered HTML where the API
81:57 - call has already been made on the server
81:59 - they've gotten that data rendered all
82:00 - HTML that's
82:02 - cached so you can get like a really
82:06 - quick response from the server because
82:09 - it it only has to go to the node server
82:10 - and to go right back it doesn't actually
82:12 - have to ask uh WordPress for anything
82:14 - because it's already cached that so
82:16 - that's what I'm doing there and then it
82:19 - does switch over so if if you go to the
82:21 - site kattic
82:23 - uh and check
82:25 - out the uh
82:28 - routing oh man it's so weird I switched
82:30 - to my mouse I'm not on my trackpad now
82:32 - it's really weird to uh try to find all
82:34 - my
82:35 - windows uh but basically yeah if you try
82:38 - to route and you'll notice there is no
82:40 - page refresh so it's a combination of
82:42 - server side and and client side uh
82:45 - rendering
82:47 - routing good question
82:49 - though let me know if you have any other
82:52 - question uh put it in the comments or
82:53 - direct message me on Twitter if you if
82:55 - you want to like talk about it in more
82:57 - depth as to like how how and why I did
83:02 - it Rohan says I'm addicted too got to do
83:07 - something aim high I feel you Jesse okay
83:10 - I'm not the only
83:11 - one um Rohan says uh is saying partic in
83:16 - particular to person but every this goes
83:18 - for everybody that's uh that's watching
83:21 - now live or later on if you want us to
83:24 - help outside of here you can drop by in
83:27 - our IRC anytime so we do have an IRC
83:30 - Channel um for this for this stream and
83:35 - it's uh # FCC Jessie so # FCC
83:41 - Jess so you can join that um I'm in
83:45 - there like occasionally I do I am linked
83:47 - up on my phone so a lot of times I I do
83:49 - get the the messages that come through
83:52 - uh so but I try to pop in you know a
83:55 - couple times a day and there are other
83:57 - people that are in there too so if you
83:58 - need help with something you know come
84:00 - in there and ask some questions or if
84:02 - you're more advanced and you want to
84:04 - help some people come in there and and
84:05 - provide some of your your
84:12 - experience uh Rohan says apart from
84:15 - those uh
84:19 - Patrick uh Jesse and a few other nobody
84:22 - here is even in the neighborhood of
84:24 - awesome I don't I don't think I should
84:26 - be put on the list of awesome either but
84:28 - uh says we can definitely improve I
84:30 - would say the only thing awesome about
84:32 - me is that for some reason I decided it
84:35 - would be a good idea to show the world
84:36 - how much of a noob I am every day uh
84:40 - when I do coding um I don't I don't know
84:43 - that everybody would be able to do that
84:45 - so that's that maybe is something unique
84:47 - about
84:48 - me but uh really you all help me so much
84:53 - uh with with my improving my skills that
84:56 - um I think I'm getting just as much if
84:58 - not more out of this than you are Andrew
85:01 - says now stop posting Jesse will not
85:03 - finish this endless
85:04 - conversation thanks Andrew uh that is
85:07 - true yeah I
85:10 - um I just can't stand to leave questions
85:12 - unanswered if you all have questions you
85:14 - know maybe maybe you really need that
85:17 - question answered it can make a big
85:19 - difference in your life so I just want
85:20 - to answer it but all right but this will
85:22 - be it
85:24 - um last
85:26 - question Rohan asks what would be your
85:29 - next project if you are allowed to
85:31 - reveal
85:33 - it all right let me think what will the
85:35 - next project
85:37 - be I don't know for sure how the order
85:40 - is going to be so I'll tell you maybe
85:42 - one or two that's
85:44 - possible
85:48 - um there's going to be potentially a
85:51 - site that that doesn't really have a
85:53 - name or Ur or anything yet but could
85:55 - possibly aggregate content from all of
85:58 - our other university sites into one
86:00 - place and pull it all in if I do that
86:03 - site I'm going to use the WordPress API
86:05 - because a lot of our sites are running
86:06 - WordPress and I'm going to pull it all
86:08 - in it's going to be a react site it's
86:09 - going to be set up similar to this but
86:10 - of course better because why why do a
86:14 - say site exactly like you did the last
86:15 - one right you want to improve so it'll
86:17 - be similar to this if I do that it'll be
86:19 - cool because I'll get to start right
86:21 - from scratch and show the whole way
86:23 - which I know you know a lot of people
86:25 - have been asking for that to start from
86:26 - scratch so that's one potential project
86:29 - that it's going to happen like I'm like
86:32 - 90% sure what's going to happen I'm just
86:33 - not sure when um the other project that
86:36 - I was working on before this if you look
86:38 - on my YouTube channel I did a couple of
86:41 - live streams where I was trying
86:44 - to do a redesign of our main website
86:47 - franciscan.edu but I was trying to limit
86:49 - it like within the restrictions of the
86:51 - current current content management
86:53 - system that will get replaced so
86:56 - basically I was trying to make that site
86:57 - look nice and run as fast as possible
86:59 - within the constraints that I have to
87:01 - work in so that was kind of a weird
87:04 - situation but made it interesting
87:06 - because I couldn't use a lot of the
87:08 - tools and the techniques that I would
87:10 - like to use because of those constraints
87:13 - so those two projects are for sure
87:15 - happening there might be some little
87:16 - like onepage sites that'll pop in here
87:18 - and there but that
87:23 - that's about as good of an answer as I
87:25 - can give you right now
87:29 - and shoot Andrew did ask one more
87:32 - question and it's a followup to an
87:33 - earlier question so I'm going to take it
87:35 - because technically I don't think it's
87:37 - really new just a
87:38 - clarification uh Andrew is saying so the
87:41 - server side also fetches data from
87:44 - WordPress or is only HTML gets to the
87:46 - front end and then fetches so this is to
87:49 - clarify before from Aim High's question
87:52 - it actually does fetch the data on the
87:54 - server so if you want to test it out I'm
87:57 - not going to do it right now because
87:58 - then I'll be here for another 10 minutes
88:00 - but go to the
88:02 - website on your first load of the
88:04 - website so don't do don't click any
88:06 - links on the first
88:08 - load uh go to view source so don't use
88:12 - the inspector view the source and it you
88:15 - know it'll come up with a really ugly
88:16 - looking white page with HTML you'll be
88:19 - able to see all the data right there
88:22 - right if it was fetching at client side
88:24 - you wouldn't see all the data You' just
88:26 - see the initial markup that gets loaded
88:28 - all right but it's actually making the
88:31 - API call server side first and then
88:33 - sending it all comp all completed and
88:36 - rendered out the way it should look that
88:39 - way search engines see the complete page
88:43 - otherwise search engines wouldn't see
88:44 - all that data that we're pulling from
88:47 - WordPress so that's the main reason why
88:49 - we do it I I have I haven't tested Ted
88:52 - it this myself but I've heard other
88:53 - people say that you get a slightly
88:56 - faster first page load if you do it that
88:58 - way as well
89:01 - so finally gotten to the end of the uh
89:05 - live chat I did go kind of fast at the
89:07 - end so if I missed your question I
89:09 - sincerely apologize and please ask it in
89:11 - the comments or message me on Twitter
89:13 - and I will answer it as soon as I can
89:17 - thank you uh to everybody for watching
89:19 - we had a lot of action in the live chat
89:21 - a lot of viewers uh I think above
89:24 - average for most of the the stream we
89:28 - had above average amount of viewers so
89:30 - thank you so much uh for everything for
89:33 - all the input you all had I'll be back
89:36 - tomorrow same time 2 pm eastern time not
89:40 - sure what the topic will be yet I'll
89:42 - I'll pick it uh
89:44 - tomorrow um and thanks thanks to the two
89:47 - people that submitted pool requests big
89:49 - thanks to vet and was it Daniel I'm
89:52 - going to I'm going to check so that I
89:56 - don't get this
89:57 - wrong shoot and I can't find it because
90:00 - I don't have my trackpad uh I think it
90:02 - was Daniel if it wasn't I'm sorry but
90:05 - the two people that submitted pool
90:06 - requests since yesterday um I really
90:08 - really appreciate that you did an
90:10 - awesome job I I love the requests and
90:12 - it's definitely a big Improvement in the
90:14 - project so uh anyway thanks thanks for
90:18 - watching and uh I'll be back tomorrow
90:20 - have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse uh sorry I did not get the Tweet out about this video until uh 3 minutes ago so I don't know if how many people rely on Twitter uh to know when I'm going to go live so maybe it'll be a little bit slower here at the beginning in terms of viewers uh also I didn't even get the uh event scheduled until maybe about an hour ago so uh today's just been I got in late and I had all kind of stuff going on I actually just interviewed a student uh who's interested in working uh with my department uh so that would be awesome if it works out I know uh he has another interview uh with a company near here as well so I wish him luck with that but uh hopefully he decides to work with us so yeah I'm just going to wait I'm not going to get started for maybe a couple minutes we'll just talk for a little bit uh just to wait for some people to come in because I um I alerted this so late there we go okay now now we're at a normal it was showing seven viewers for a while and now it just jumped to 54 so that's closer to our normal amount of viewers um all right uh we got some yeah we got some people looks like some new new faces new names in the live chat um that I haven't I don't remember seeing before so hey everybody oh we got hello from the Ukraine awesome and let's see La tell me if I pronounce this wrong is it Laquita or Lita uh let let me know how if I pronounce that right um uh but on time for a live chat so awesome and um Yousef asked will you do a todo app with react from scratch okay now we're picking up we're up over 70 viewers now so let's um let's get started all right everybody shouting out where they're from we got India Barcelona UK awesome thanks for watching from from Chile from Rome awesome wow we got we got people from all over so and it looks like yeah it looks like we're getting some retweets here so that's picking up picking up fast from Los Angeles Romania uh all right so today I'm really excited about this talk topic and uh this was totally um I hadn't planned on doing this today but I got a pull request um from uh well I actually got two pool requests so let me let me bring these over just to show you because I want to give give credit where it is due so between yesterday's show and Today's Show I got two pool requests this one is from Danny and um you can check that I'm not going to go through all these on the air because you can see in the link in the show description uh you can check these out but had some cool stuff here um kind of preparing for even more so I'm I'm expecting I guess another another Pool request here um but did some kind of some optimization things so not no changes that would really be visible like uh to the user uh but definitely going to make things more readable easier to maintain um in terms of the code the other other pool request uh this is what we're going to be talking about today uh so vet this is his second pool request uh he had a great one um I think it was a few days ago or maybe uh yeah I think it was Friday uh that we talked about yesterday but this one uh so if you were here yesterday for the live chat uh there was some talk about using uh some linters and things to try to get more of a standard um uh style to the coding so uh I I haven't I've been a little bit sloppy in coding this and in general I've been sloppy for for two reasons one the timeline for this was really tight so I just kind of cut Corners uh in in terms of formatting everything properly uh to to get it launched also it's it's always been just me working on projects and that's allowed me to get a little bit lazy because nobody's ever around to call me out on it and um I'm not saying that that's a a good thing that's definitely not a good thing but that's just how it happened uh but now it makes a lot more sense for me to have kind of a standard format for my code because all of you are looking at the code and you're you're helping me we're collaborating on this so great idea so we're going to use I don't know if you can hear that but my stomach is growling so if you hear that I'm sorry sorry but I just um I forgot to eat today so uh I don't know if that happens to you but sometimes you just get you get working and you know before you know it uh you haven't eaten so I have to make sure I eat after this stream um so we're going to use a couple of things and uh you've probably been seeing some of these things uh I know at least I've been seeing them on Twitter a lot mentioned uh prettier and standard JS I'm going to kind of take you through um what I did I I know it looks like I haven't merged these yet but I I did merge them I just haven't pushed it uh back up to uh to GitHub but let me bring over two things I'm going to bring over my command line and I'm also going to bring over or I'm going to show you the code I've Linked In the show notes to standard JS their website and to the website for prettier so you can check that out you know kind of as we're going if you want to learn more about it and first of all let me show you I I do I want to show you the amount of errors that I had once I finally ran this uh so let me go back up so this is kind of I like slowly just narrow down the errors I think this is the first set so at first I had all these errors of just things a lot of them was components that I had imported or into another component and then I never used it so I had I guess at some point thought I was going to use use it and then never removed it I was really surprised at how many of those there were because I I thought that I was usually uh pretty careful about that but evidently I was not uh so those are a bunch of bunch of stuff there also if you remember from our episode whenever we uh we were making jQuery work with react and we had a bunch of functions in a separate file in our in our um what what file was it our app.js file yeah so we had in a separate file we had these functions that were using jQuery but then we were calling them in component did Mount so to um when we're using standard JS which uses uh es lent kind of behind the scenes it was looking at that component and saying you're trying to call this function and it's not defined it really it was defined in our other um our other document and then not only that but it was looking at that document where we actually had to find those functions and saying hey you define this and you never used it so so most of the errors I had were because of that okay so not really a big deal so I'll show you how I fix those errors because I'm I'm guessing that maybe if you're going to try to use this for the first time you might run into some of these errors as well I mean maybe hopefully you're not as as bad as I was with uh with my code and you don't get as many errors but I'll show you how to go over those uh how to fix those errors I'm going to show you my package Json first first so that if you if you want to try this out but you don't really want to like pull down my code uh you can just kind of piece it together so let's move this off before I show you how I I did those and we'll go to my package Json let me know if this is this is too small I'll just I could probably let me make it a little bit bigger right now I don't want to make it too big because I want you to be able to see kind of like the big picture here um of what we what we have now that we didn't have before and I have have some things up here that are new too but they don't really apply to what we're talking about today so basically we have this whole section now that's Dev dependencies and this this is what has been brought in okay and remember this is all from ven's uh pool request almost none of this is stuff that I did the only thing in here that I did on my own was I I imported this uh Babel es lint um package uh and I'll explain why I needed that in a minute um so basically these these four things got this working and then we have some new commands so we have this lint all right we have precommit and then we have lint lint staged all right so we have a lot of things going here where basically vet set this up uh which is very very nice of him he set all this up to look through all my folders where I had components and JavaScript files and to go through lint those and then automatically reformat them based on the standard JS um specifications okay so that's what the the linting all right is more like the standard JS the reformatting is from prettier okay and if you check out the docs for those uh you'll see so this is what's added also I I added this part down here and this was basically to deal with some of the errors so I'll talk about that in a second uh when I deal with those errors and that's it and as soon as I'm going to push this code I might as well do it right now let me push this to GitHub right now so you can follow along and everything is um is up to date on my other screen I'm just making this um I figure you um you all know how to run a commit uh but also you see this is new so this is um basically this is happening right when we run a commit before we were just doing a commit now all of this runs before the commit happens so really you can't you can't make a commit now without everything being put in uh a standard format which is awesome and that was that was from vet that's what um his additions here are doing all right so all this is now being pushed to the master branch and it's completed so if you go to the repo on the master Branch you can see all of this you can open up the uh package Json you can see everything I'm talking about and follow along uh so let me talk about some of these errors I'm not going to go over every single error just the ones that I think were kind of like it it was kind of tricky for me to figure out and uh kind of like to share how to get around those so um let's see we had these ones as I said are are really easy I just Define these components and hadn't used them okay so some of these like I said I had been defining these functions and not actually using them well I was defining them in the app.js file but not using them there and then I was using them in components but it was coming up as not defined so here's how I got around that so for some of them like for Fetch and for you know the dollar sign I just added them globally as uh since basically I use fetch in almost all the uh page level components so if you just add this you know this this whole section here okay including the ending things that fix that so basically that just lets es lint know that it's okay uh you can use these they're defined somewhere and it's all right to you so that fixed those errors but then you don't want to do this for for everything let's say you only use something once you don't want to make it a global so at the page level I did something like this so I use in component did Mount I use init tabs okay this is like I said this is defined over here in appjs so what I did here is I just added at the top in the comment Global and then the name of this function okay and that got rid of that error and I did a similar thing in every component I just put the name of the function so that got rid of those errors you know no big deal in reality at some point if I have more time now I know I've I've discussed this already with with all of you that this project needs to wind up so there's some things that I know should be done that may not get done because um they're not essential to the project functioning and I need to move on because I have a lot of other projects that are lining up that I need to uh to start working on so um we'll see maybe if I get some of these student workers that might be a good thing a good project for them to come in and and do some of this but I figure you know there's definitely a better way to do this than to have all this going in a a you know separate file so um that may happen at some point now the next the next error that I do want to talk about that was the trickiest was this one so in resources. JS which is the file we're in now it said there's a parsing error unexpected token equals on line in this case it was line 11 which this is probably different now since I had changed it so the line it is now is at 12 so it was basically throwing an error because we did this so the way that I found uh to get around this is um basically it wasn't it wasn't recognizing that like we're using this class here okay so it had something to do with that all right I'm not claiming that I know technically everything that was going on but basically the problem was that this is a newer syntax and it needed to recognize that as a newer syntax so that's why I installed this Babel es lent okay if you're not familiar with Babel that's a transpiler that lets you use the latest JavaScript syntax and it turns it into older syntax that older browsers can handle okay so I imported this so just yarn add Babel es lint and then I added the flag um hyphen capital D okay or you could do hyphen hyen Dev either way it'll put in your Dev dependencies that added it here and then down here you can add you can say what parser you want ES to use so I added this to the pars so I'm I'm saying es lent but just recognize that it's standard that's doing this but it's using ES lent kind of in the background okay so um we are talking about standard JS all right so that's it that's the only um the only things I really had to do I guess I'll show you the appjs just in case hopefully this won't be an issue with you because you won't have all these functions sitting in a separate fun file like this but all I did was all these functions are the one that I'm using in components and I'm not using on in this particular file so at the top I just did es lent disable and then at some point down here I reenable es lent so I enable it again here okay so the disadvantage is like everything in here is not getting linted properly although I did run lint before I did this so all the other errors that were in here here I fixed so these are all okay uh because I did it beforehand uh so I could you can actually like specifically uh put in like the the one rule that you want to rule out inside here but I couldn't find what it was I tried a couple of different ones and it wasn't working so just for the sake of getting this working before the video I um I just disabled everything within here okay so that's pretty much it that's all it took I mean on my end that's all it took to get this working vet I'm sure had had more work on his end and you can check out his his pool request to see all the work that he did and and everything that changed all the files that changed but at this point let me show you the results I know I've been ignoring the live chat uh for a few minutes I will get to you and I'll answer the questions just a minute but I I wanted to um I wanted to try getting to the point quickly and getting through it uh because usually um what happens is I get a bunch of viewers right off the bat and then we kind of like I kind of mess around a little bit and just kind of talk about some general things before we get started and I usually lose a bunch of people probably because this maybe is their first time viewing and they're thinking like what's this guy doing I thought he was going to talk about whatever I the title of the video is uh so that's why I'm ignoring the uh live chat right now but I'll get to it in a minute I just want to give you an example of how everything is um is now formatted kind of autof formatted and uh let's see let's try to do a side by side so I'm going to bring up this code and you can do you can open this up in GitHub as well on my other screen I'm just opening up this project in GitHub and I'm going to kind of go back in time to a previous commit before I did all this and we're just going to check out since I have the resources page up let's just check the resources page just to see what the difference is so I'm going to go I'm going to put these side by side make this a bit bigger for you and see I haven't I actually haven't compared this yet so hopefully it's the comparison is somewhat obvious so we might have to try another file but um you could see well aside from you know slight slight difference up here we have yeah so so I probably went back too far some of the stuff had been changed so let's get down more into the um into the body of this wonder if this is even going to be a good example no it's not because I went back too far sorry about that let me um go back to a commit that's maybe I want to go let me go somewhere that's maybe right there we go this this should be closer oops click the wrong thing here we go and sorry if you if you're not familiar with Git and GitHub and you're just you know kind of watching this you're probably somewhat confused about how that works so uh sorry about that if you watch some of the uh previous videos I explained uh how more about how how git Works uh um no my um uh my trackpad just ran out of batteries so this is terrible at least I now would be a great time for me to look back at the live chat and see if I can get I do have a mouse here I'm going to turn this mouse on so that I don't have to actually leave and go get batteries somewhere although I could change the batteries out from the mouse and put them in the trackpad but there we go it's just easier to use the mouse all right I haven't used Mouse in so long anybody I think if you use like a Macbook or an iMac with the trackpad you understand what I'm talking about once you get used to it it's just like Mouse using a mouse feels weird all right so I do have the mouse now um let's go I'm actually going to go to that app .js file because I think that has the most potential for improvement uh and probably the out of any of the the things that I've done so that might be the most drastic uh and obvious change so let me um make this a little bigger and so we can see so these are the same files before and after using uh using prettier so we did we did linting with uh standard JS and then prettier does like the auto reformatting uh so let's see so far not not not bad you so I did take this out because uh obviously like this is not really needed if we're doing going to do all our this lenting and I'm actually somewhat surprised at how well formatted this was okay big here's the big thing that that you can you probably already even caught this there are no semicolons at the end of the line here but there are here and we talked about this yesterday is that when when I was learning JavaScript it was always like you have to use a semicolon at the end of the line right I mean I think some of like the tutorials like the in browser tutorials if you don't put the semico and it doesn't work you know you have to go back and fix it so I'm trying to get away from that but obviously I'm I'm still doing it I probably don't even realize I'm doing it sometimes so with standard JS you don't use semicolons okay so all the semicolons are gone and OB and everything still works right it's not nothing's crashed uh so that is an obvious thing here we go this looks different function sticky nav okay so this is a big example of a change right this is really obvious so before we had I actually didn't write this code uh you can see I got this um from someone on codepen and credited and everything so I it's it's legit to use um but everything was written all in one line like that which is pretty hard to read now this is automatically done that it's all moved on to separate lines so yes it takes up more lines certainly but it's so much easier to read like that so that is one really useful kind of change in the uh in the code there the other thing it did was it it made me so it threw an error over this and it made me I was actually had to change this um I had to change this manually it wouldn't let me just use ve and Define all these things I had to use a separate VE for each line so I guess that's good to know that that's that's the default with standard JS so you get the point you can check out you you have access to the repo you can check all this out so I just wanted to show a quick example of how this this works now I will check out the live chat I'm sorry for having ignored you but if you ever watch this you know how I am and once I look at the live chat I tend to just talk a lot and uh to you all and answer questions so uh I wanted to make sure I got through this and wow okay so we pretty much got through most of what I wanted to say in less than half an hour so we'll say this if you are only here to check out prer in standard JS and you don't really care uh for any of the question and answer stuff uh you can uh thanks for watching and uh you don't have to watch anymore because that was the demo uh for all of that but if you do have any questions you want to stick around put them in the live chat I'll go through all the questions in the live chat and I'll I'll provide answers and uh uh a lot of times everybody else in the live chat provides really great answers as well so it's a good resource to you if you can't stick around or you're just nervous about asking a question in the live chat you can direct message me on Twitter or you can put it in the comments uh to this video uh so a link to my Twitter profile is in the description for the video all right so let's get to the chat I'm starting at the top and I'm just working my way down also so let me know I was getting some messages that the stream Health wasn't good so let me know if you you had any problems with this stream that's really odd usually the internet connection that I have um at work is is really really fast okay so everybody everybody if you remember the beginning was kind of shouting out where they are from which is awesome I love to see where you all are from so we had Romania Germany another one from Germany um somebody asked about my editor which uh which is great I don't mind I get asked that almost every video um but I don't really mind uh because you might have just joined in you didn't weren't able to check it out I do have a link in the description to the the tools some of the tools that I use so if you're interested in what I use check out the description I link pretty much everything that I'm using I'm I'm linking in there uh we got somebody else from Los Angeles uh let's see I had said earlier I talked about um I asked if anyone else forgot to eat when they were working uh and Patrick says forget to eat more than I remember to eat Rohan forgets uh sometimes I forget that I've eaten don't even know how that happens so like somewhat the opposite problem um okay so uh surv has a question and this this question was like maybe 20 minutes ago so hopefully you're still here if not maybe somebody else had still wants to hear the answer uh ask how is this different from es lent okay so uh vene actually gave an answer uh but I'll read it out in case you're watching this video later on and can't see the live chat and the answer is as I mentioned standard JS uses es lint uh as V says under the hood so kind of in the background it's using ES lent okay so uh but it's using the um the standard all like what is specified in standard JS so you know if you go here and you can read about the JavaScript standard style okay so basically it's it's using ES lint to enforce the JavaScript standard style and you don't have to do any of the formatting like you don't have to configure sorry you don't have to configure es lint at all it does it for you sorry I'm going to take a drink okay um so hopefully that answers uh your question and uh if not uh you know ask for clarification and uh we can talk more about it Andrew says uh hello folks I'll watch the replay on way to home have fun all right thanks for stopping in Andrew uh yeah throw uh you have any questions or anything um later on when you watch it put it in the um comments please all right so Sebastian ask why don't you use a lter for atom so you get the errors as you write them actually to be honest with you I have up on my other screen a couple of atom plugins that were recommended uh from the the page the uh the page for standard JS so I was looking into using plugins for atom to do just that I just didn't have time to get it all working uh before the video so if anyone uses standard JS and uses atom and has a plugin that you want to recommend please let me know and uh cuz i' like I I was trying to read through some plugins to figure out which one was the best to use but I I didn't come to any conclusion yet all right we have someone from Dubai awesome uh noi says nice anyway I'm still learning basic JavaScript in HTML this stream is way above my knowledge we'll come back to it in a few months when I know a little more um so NY yeah not every stream that I do is this high level so some of them are really like basic uh CSS changes or basic JavaScript HTML stuff so um just check out uh if you want like you can follow follow me on Twitter and or subscribe to the free code Camp Channel and then you'll get alerts saying what topic I'm going to be working on each day and maybe there will be a topic that'll be more like at at your level where you're at right now I'm also going to be doing some beginner videos and putting them on my own YouTube channel which is linked in the description so you can check that out as well uh and maybe if you want to subscribe it you don't have to subscribe my channel but you'll get the benefit of being alerted when I do upload those uh I think um since I'll be on vacation next next week I'm going to be at the beach but it's looking like there's going to be some rain so maybe I'll try to get some of those videos done then and so maybe they'll be posted next week uh I think that would be nice since I might not be able to live stream if the internet's down at least May or if the internet's not good enough at least maybe I can upload some of those prerecorded videos and those are going to be initially aimed at like people who are just beginning all right a high says Noy you will get there I used to be in your shoes eight months ago now I'm interviewing for four companies awesome uh aim high congratulations on that that's that's really uh really awesome to hear um let let me know let us know if you get if you get a job from any of the uh companies I'd love to hear the good news so uh good luck with that uh someone from Orlando sends their greetings hello from Nigeria awesome uh Andrew says if you get in the industry and you're good it escalates quickly so good advice yeah just you know get in there and give it a shot a high says uh it yeah mainly uh free code camp but supplement my learning with you Demi okay so awesome resources obviously free code Camp because if you're here you know about free code camp but Udi also $10 courses I have done I did a course from udmi before uh that was like one of those $10 courses and I did like it it was useful I know you if you've heard me before say I don't think I've spent more than like $30 on course coures um learning this stuff but uh udmi was one of the places that I did spend money on and uh I was I was happy with with the course noi says uh learning with Treehouse Treehouse is nice I've looked at treeh house and stuff and um and it looked nice I haven't done that much with it but uh maybe if if anyone watching has some experience with treeh house too and wants to comment about it from what I understand it it seems like it's a pretty good resource um we have someone from Russia awesome so um LOL LOL asks hey Jesse how big is your company how many employees uh we have like 500 employees I think so I work at a university um a university here in the United States and it's a small University so we don't have maybe like 2,000 students so that's that's considered a pretty small um university and we have I think about 500 employees and that that includes the professors uh as well so the staff and the faculty combined are about about 500 uh and my particular I I actually work in the marketing department and we we have in my entire department I think it's only about 15 people and my my division within my department there's only three of us uh and only two of us actually do any code so so it's really kind of small I guess that we really only have two people doing code and uh we we almost never even work on the same project because we're just kind of really swamped with projects all the time so I'm usually working by myself as I mentioned earlier I am getting some student workers and maybe I'm trying to set up some internship stuff too maybe for the fall uh so hopefully I'll have some more people working I would really love to have the student workers involved so they can get some good experience uh in using you know GitHub and some more modern build tools and things and get some good experience to put on their portfolio I think that would be awesome so anyway I guess that's you know kind of small small company small University uh we have hello from India awesome noi says what I can stay away from using semicolon and JS yeah who knew right I only recently found that out I guess I'm behind the game though which is I mean that happens if you if you stay off Twitter for a while it's easy to fall behind um aim high says um well it says Noy follow me on on codepen uh just go to codepen and search my username so I don't I don't know if a high meant for me to uh give the username out loud so I'm not so uh I'll just leave it out if you want if you don't mind and you want me to read out your username so people can check out your code pen let me know and I I will do it Rohan prefers the semicolon and LOL LOL also prefers so okay so we have some some debate here about the semicolon I prefer the semicolon simply because I'm familiar with it I'm used to using it but I imagine it will be better if I just get rid of the semicolon that way it's just one less thing I have to worry about one less thing I have to do uh I'm sure it will speed up my my coding ever so slightly but over the long long term that'll probably add up and it'll save me like 10 minutes of time which which would be important I guess um Patrick says I really prefer one ve let or const with commas is there a way to disable that yeah actually so if if you're you're not sure what he's referring to uh we had this comparison here where was it oh okay here so we um when we use prettier or I'm sorry when we use uh standard JS to lint this it said that I had to change this from using this V and just using One V and defining multiple variables to putting each variable being defined with its own V on a separate line there and uh Patrick ask if that can be disabled I'm pretty sure it can there's anything that you can do in es lent in terms of disabling or customizing you can do with standard JS because it's using ES lent uh in the background and if worse comes to worse you could just add in like in a comment tag disable uh es lent if you wanted to and just disable that portion that's that's kind of like would be a pain to have to do that all the time but if you really wanted to that that would work uh Andrew says Jesse have any experience with browser extension so you mean like making a browser extension if if you mean making a browser extension then no I've never actually made my own browser extension uh I have been interested in doing it at times in the past but I just never really like had had the time or like a real need to do it uh but but also at least for my purposes if I wanted to make a browser extension that could do something I it's easier for me to use something like tamper monkey which I do use and then just write the code in tamper monkey and apply it so I kind of get around having to really learn how to make a browser extension and I can still get done what I want to get done so um but otherwise I don't have any direct experience with making uh a browser attention all right we have someone from Palestine welcome and sorry it keeps uh for some reason normally it doesn't do this but today in the live chat I don't know why but I keep getting bounced down to the bottom of the chat so I keep losing my place all right so okay Palestine someone from mov um oh Andrew from malova awesome I have um my my wife has some nieces and nephews and actually one of them is my goddaughter uh who were adopted from mova uh so awesome Nigeria welcome uh daff derp asks are you done uh yeah actually so I know it's it's it's way early right it's I've only been on for 40 minutes so and at the time when you asked that it was I'd only been on for half an hour so yeah basically with for the topic of the the stream I'm done with that so um I know we had talked about doing shorter streams so I'm I'm making an effort to do shorter streams um if you if you missed if you're just coming in and you missed it the replay will be available on free code Camp um just a few minutes after I end the the stream so uh you can watch the replay Andrew says today I made some big rebases and merges had to remove some big files from entire repository history 386 commits wow that's crazy uh yesterday we did a um a stream on doing merges of pool requests and stuff so uh wow that seems like I mean I don't know maybe I don't know what to compare that to but that really seems like a lot of of commits to be working with there um Yong asks where do you deploy the website AWS it's actually digital ocean all right Ro Rohan answered that so yeah digital ocean we do here at the University we have three different hosts right well actually four different hosts the main website which is franciscan.edu is actually hosted here on campus and the IT department runs their own physical servers there okay that that is actually going to change soon and we're going to when we redesign the site which will be like probably the next really major project that I do um I'll do a lot of little projects in between when I start that one but we host that there we host some sites on GoDaddy so we just have like a little shared Hosting account that we just do some really minor stuff with uh but it's easy to it's nice to have because you can do like the oneclick five minute WordPress install and have something going and so um we also host on digital ocean and we have a site on AWS all right we have uh someone from Mexico awesome all right no said thanks Jesse you're welcome all right looks look like somebody was talking about getting discounts on udmi courses and uh mobin 92 says you can go to real. Discount I've never been there so I'm not endorsing the site because I don't I don't know what's on there but uh I guess there's discounts for stuff on there um I'm not sure how to pronounce most of this name but it ends with Isaac and I know how to pronounce Isaac so I'm I'm sorry I just didn't want to mess up your name so I didn't want to attempt it but says which would you advise becoming a full stack developer or frontend developer I um one day I would like to know enough about the backend to be able to say I'm full stack right now I'm only comfortable saying that that I'm front end and my idea was well I'll start with front end and make money with that and then slowly work my way to learn everything learn the back end and be full stack so that was my idea and that's how I wanted to do it I will say if you start from the outset saying I want to be full stack you'll probably get there sooner for me I just had a family you know I need to take care of and I need to pay the bills so it was like okay I'm going to start out because I know I can get money doing frontend work right now uh so I haven't made it to full stack as quickly as I had hoped just because I'm busy you know doing my job as doing front end stuff so it kind of depends on what you want def it's easier to become a frontend developer than a full stack it'll take less time so if you really need to kind of get into it and start making money with It Go Front End first and then learn the rest but if you have the time to just dedicate to learning uh Go full stack and then you'll make more money as a full stack developer uh most likely uh anyway so that's my advice maybe you all in the live chat have some better advice than that or some alternate opinions but uh that's that's kind of my viewpoint on it uh okay there someone from Wales awesome hello Andrew says with time you will be full stack even if you don't want it and uh that's that's kind of true I'm sure Andrew was joking a little bit but that that is actually kind of true if you'll see like if you've watched any of my streams before occasionally I'm doing stuff that's definitely not frontend even though I'm a frontend developer and especially if you're on a small team or freelancing yeah you're going to have to to learn a lot of stuff eventually so um yeah I I mean probably most of us even if we're doing mostly frontend stuff occasionally do have to do backend stuff from time to time so it wouldn't be that much of a jump for us to just do some more learning and and jump in and and be doing full stack not to say that it's easy to be full stack but just to say that that's a natural progression all right have someone from Brazil awesome hello um Andrew says semicolons are noise for me all right so Andrew Andrew is um against semicolons and we have what Rohan and Patrick are on team semicolon Rohan says you could do backend exclusively or networking or full stack it's just what you like yeah I didn't even mention that yeah uh I guess it depends on what you like doing if you don't like doing backend stuff then don't try to be full stack uh if you just like front end stick with that because that's important uh you know you don't want to be stuck doing something that you don't like Rohan says for example I get bored easily with one thing so I would prefer full stack Andrew says or what the company has for you to work yeah that's that's important too you know if you get a job doing one or the other then that's that's what you're G to do Rohan uh said with small to medium companies you are usually you usually are overworked but you do get to try lots of stuff yeah I can understand that bro so that's that's where I'm at right now exactly small company overworked but I do get to do a lot of stuff so I will say this normally my schedule is nice I don't work a lot it's just been crazy for the last month or so so hopefully I can get back to my normal working hours and it won't be so crazy all right Sebastian says I'm Romanian but for the past 8 to9 years have been living in Spain awesome Andrew uh Andrew said he had a year in a company and during that year tried Java schola PHP as a back language and even wrote SQL so definitely a lot of stuff just to do in in one year okay the es lint rule for repetitive ver is one one ve so if you're interested in learning how to get around uh this being able to do this instead of being forced to do this with the es lent the rule is one there so you could disable one there right um or or enable I'm not I forget how that works but basically look up in the docs uh you know do a control fine for one bear that's what you want it's what you want to look for uh Rohan rohan's commenting on the length of the video when I was talking about that that we went from like 2.7 hours to 30 minutes big difference so definitely cut it on this video is going to end up being an hour after we get through the Q&A but the actual like I want to say not that I did any coding today today but what would normally be the coding portion was only 25 minutes which may be a record I think in my early streams I I kept it pretty short but that's definitely short compared to what we've been doing uh Joshua asks what UI Library do you like to use with react I've been having trouble with the at bar on material UI uh so for this project I actually use materialize just their regular framework and I've had to adapt things to react at times so uh I don't know that I recommend doing normally I do recommend materialize I really like that framework I've used it a lot and I'm familiar with their all their conventions of like class names and things so it's easy for me to build things rapidly with materialize but I am going to need to switch now that most of what I'm doing is in react I think I'm going to need to switch to something that is is more react specific so I know there is uh someone linked I can't remember maybe it was vet maybe yesterday linked uh to a set of react components that were based on the materialized framework so I'm going to have to check those out I know there's material UI there's material MD or no is it react MD I think I still I must have closed the tab but there was is a uh another material design style react framework that's out there as well and it was MD something um so I don't I don't have a react like component library to recommend to you uh but I mean I have used materialized with react and it's basically worked without without too many issues even though it's not really made for react components Andrew has some good advice uh when for when we were talking about commits and everything uh get commits says when you remove something from the entire repository history every commit changes hashes so you have to be careful and announce to all team members yeah uh definitely keep that in mind when you're trying to decide like what how you're going to merge things and um if you're making changes to your commits how is that going to affect your other team if it's just you then you could pretty much do whatever you want I guess and it won't really matter but if you have a team of people submitting pool requests and all working on the project then uh you you don't want to mess everything up for them so decide on beforehand I guess on how you're going to handle things like that with your team uh V asked did you check now.sh for hosting actually I I went to a conference where they demonstrated how to use now uh to get a site up and running and you can even buy domain names right through the command line it was really awesome and quick so I am familiar with using that uh I think I think I would like to use it at some point I mean obviously not for this project we already have everything set up uh but possibly for some smaller projects I would like to do that um I'm not sure like I mean obviously we're doing some low balancing and we have this running on multiple servers and then there's so there's a lot more going on here but I think there will be some smaller sites that I'll be working on in the near future I think that would be a good candidate for trying that out uh I'll have to look into the pricing as well because obviously I would want to use if I'm doing this officially for my job we're going to be using a you know a custom domain and I think if you use your own domain at that point you have to be using I I don't remember the pricing structure but uh anyway I'll have to check the only thing basically I need to look into is the pricing and to see if it would make sense to do it like that but otherwise I'm very impressed with using now uh for hosting so if you're not familiar with that the same people that do nextjs which is the basically kind of I don't I don't know what the right term for it is but like the scaffolding for that I'm using to build with react that same those same people do now which is a way to very easily deploy straight from the command line uh right to hosting and uh it's it's just it's so simple uh you know definitely check it out I don't want to spend a lot of time describing what I saw at this conference because you could probably just find the video a video of it or check it out for yourself and see but I mean literally as I mentioned you you can do as much as even buy a domain name right from the command line and in a few commands have a completely new website up and running with your own custom domain and an SSL and all that uh it's really really uh kind of slick and uh nice process um noi says uh LOL Jesse I'm following the same footsteps I'm focusing on front end then later on back end but I want to get my foot in with front end yeah I I mean I don't think it's a bad like I said it depends on what you need you what point in life you're and what you need I mean for me it just like I didn't have time to just spend a lot of time studying and and dedicate my time to that I needed to make money like literally I had quit a job and I was looking for work and couldn't find work and I needed to make money and learn something so I caught a break and a friend of mine had a marketing company that needed some website work someone to do website work and you know I was getting some work on the side with them and the only the way for me to get even more work was to learn this stuff so that that was what just what I needed to do um because I I had a family I had to pay bills so if I had to do it again maybe I would have and I I was completely single with not a lot of responsibilities maybe I would have tried to like just dedicate a bunch of time to just learning and be you know be full stack but uh either way I think is is definitely respectable legitimate way of going it just depends on what you need uh Matt says it pays to spend the time to really learn one aspect first okay so awesome yeah something to be said for focusing I guess on on focusing your attention on one thing uh Sebastian asks where should I start looking for work as a frontend Dev uh and we have some answers in the live chat I'll read them out Rohan says oh this isn't an answer to that question uh Andrew says stack over flow so yeah definitely stack Overflow has this whole job uh board that's that's really awesome so let me bring this up just in in case I'm sure most of you are familiar with stack Overflow but if you haven't seen the jobs yet there you see the jobs right here right and they they will show you jobs based on what you searched for on stack Overflow like assuming you have an account and everything and uh and they have your data and uh usually like they awesome jobs like you know check this out frontend developer 90 to 130k that's insane that's that's a lot of money um way more than than I make uh so you know if you check it out you get lots of details about the job right there you know so I would just check it out check out there and then it's as simple as this and you get a lot of other related jobs I've been really impressed with stacker overflow we're actually advertising uh a position here at this University for a web developer on stack Overflow right now uh and I was really the one who pushed for like we need to list on stack Overflow because I was so impressed with how they do things uh and and how they suggest jobs to to people uh I thought that was kind of really really like no other site has has that kind of data and that user base um to be able to do what overflow jobs does so if you're looking to get like a fulltime job definitely do that if you want to just find freelance work then networking with people directly I found to be way better than going on one of the freelance job sites the jobs I got from those sites were usually not very high paying and they didn't they didn't amount to much like I didn't get like repeat clients or a lot of good leads from there that was just my experience uh the better clients were were personal connection and I would have a client that they were really impressed with what I did and then they recommended me to other people they knew and then it just kind of grew my like freelance business grew naturally like that so it takes a little while but those clients were were repeat clients and they were great to work with uh so that I had a better experience with that um we had some there was some uh discussion more about whether to go full stack or front end first Rohan prefers networking in backend but hasn't really had a real job yet so uh don't doesn't really know for sure Matt says better to focus in One Direction or uh or the other and that leads to deeper understanding in one spot yeah definitely I mean if if you force yourself to focus you're going to be way better at that one thing than you ever would have if you didn't uh there's a quote from somebody I have no idea who it was but I read a book before and uh they were saying that to be great at something you have to say no to everything else right so you you have to focus on that one thing uh if you want to be as great as you possibly can at that one thing even though you could be great at at lots of different things if you would have choose to do those things uh you have to focus on one if if you want to be really good so I definitely agree with that I mean I'm there are some really talented people that are Greatful developers but even then if they would have focused all their attention I think on on one area they could have been even better at that one area than they already are uh so but I mean you need you need people of all you need some people that don't want to focus and want to have a more broad understanding uh so and there's there are jobs for all different types of people depending on what you want to do if you want to focus or if you want to be have a more general knowledge of more things uh Zachary says it feels like the line between front and back end is so blurred in the JS world I I agree there there's definitely some blurring there I mean because you're running JavaScript on client side and server side uh so it it feels a lot of it does feel the same like when I switch over like you know I'm doing frontend stuff basically but you know I have this this server.js file like have have I now switched to the backend world just with one click here like it's still all the same thing I'm using const I'm I'm using JavaScript like it it is it does feel weird sometimes um you know like where where is that that line but uh but anyway I mean like I said I I think most of what I do is frontend so it's clear in my mind that I'm a frontend developer uh even though I do backend stuff occasionally uh Blazer Tron all right so we're back to the semicolon debate Blazer Tron says learning the basics of JS but I'd rather use semicolons mainly because I've been told that yeah I'm in the same boat that's I I don't I'm I'm probably going to try not to use semicolons as much as possible and certainly now that it's going to automatically take them out for me I'm not going to have them but um yeah I've always been told use semicolon so it is kind of a weird thing although learning to use react was the same way cuz you've always been told don't put your CSS in line and mix it with with your HTML and then we come to react and we have JavaScript HTML and CSS all mixed together right it just seems weird once you get used to it it's actually really nice uh but it's hard at first uh person it seems like the live chat the is like a NeverEnding um chat today so which is great it looks like we have some great discussion going on here so I'm going to keep yeah I I'd say probably we can get through this in about 10 minutes so about 10 minutes I'm going to end uh so I can kind of get move on to uh do some some other work that is probably boring and I don't even don't want to put on a live stream um so if you got a question get it in in about 10 minutes I can't get all the questions then uh please put them in the um uh in the comments or direct message me on Twitter and I will answer them so person asks how long have you been learning I've been learning for the past year and it feels like I'm not progressing anywhere I've been learning this for a long time I first learned how to build websites in 2003 somewhere around there and that was just basic stuff we we just opened up notepad on on a PC and started doing basic HTML and CSS and doing layout with tables and things like that uh so but I I didn't really do that much with it after that so I would say I've only really been like intensely trying to learn JavaScript in particular for like maybe the last four years five years I I don't even want to say five like maybe maybe the last three or four years have I really been focused on getting better at JavaScript before that I was doing websites but I was I wasn't like intentionally saying I want to get really good with JavaScript it was more I was focusing more on CSS at that point so I'd say three years of of more intense Focus uh to get where I'm at right now uh so don't don't be discouraged if it feels like you're not progressing it doesn't always go uh sometimes you learn a lot really fast and you feel awesome and then you work for a long time and it feels like you're not getting anywhere uh and then you'll hit another like spurt like a gross spurt right remember when when we were kids and you just like you'd go to have summer break and you'd come back to school and some people would be like Giants and cuz they hit a gross SP right the same thing happen and coding that's probably a terrible analogy but uh the same thing does happen with coding like all of a sudden you just like it seems like things are just all making sense and you you just get really good and and then you'll hit another Plateau you'll have a point where it doesn't seem like you're progressing but just because it doesn't seem like you're progressing like you you are you're learning things you're retaining things it just needs to fit together uh for for you so uh if this is something you really want to do and you enjoy doing doing then stick with it don't get discouraged uh I'm constantly looking back at things I did even a few months ago and saying wow like I I definitely would do it differently now I've I've learn you know I've gotten better uh so and you you'll get there you'll have a bunch of those moments Patrick is going back to the semicolon thing Patrick does not care about semicolons like in and of themselves but more about consistency so if you're doing Simple JS with no tooling preventing you uh from then use semicolons if so I guess use whatever you're used to using if you don't have tooling to make it consistent for you so that that seems to be Patrick's Point there which is a good point um person clarified uh the question a little bit but I think I I answered that Matt Matt response to person says it starts slow but it can really pick up find some projects doing something you enjoy and it will pick up fast the more you enjoy it the easier it will be for you to spend more time with your head in it good advice Matt uh in person ask any projects you recommend I'd love to work on some so H I don't I don't know what your level is out in terms of project I know there are some websites that just have project ideas I don't remember what the addresses are for those sites now but I'm sure if you kind of search for that concept you'll find some uh you could also try you know some of the like coding tutorials have projects you could work on like free code Camp if you haven't gone through free code Camp stuff there are a lot of projects and you don't have to go through everything to get there first you could just pick one out and try it if you want just to get an idea or you can sometimes I just ask people like friends and family like hey if do you have any good ideas for websites or apps or anything like that and see if there's a good idea uh that they have that you could work on especially if they're not coders then they're obviously never going to do that they're they're never going to use their ideas so there uh they'd probably be really happy if you Tred to make their idea uh really happen uh Noy says Hey Jesse I just installed standard and the bracket brackets extension is that it okay so I I'm all right so I don't use brackets so I'm just assuming that it's similar enough to adom that this would work so you'll need to if you're using the extension then that should give you the warnings right there so yeah that should work you should as long as you're seeing the uh the warnings about syntax in in your editor then you're good to go it may not work exactly like mine's working where it like automatically uh checks everything as soon as I get a do a commit uh so that part you might need to set up differently but if you just want like the linting in editor then you should be good to go somebody who maybe uses brackets might be able if if you're in the live chat now maybe you'll be able to give some better uh more specific advice all right Andrew has good advice uh kind of along the lines with what I was my saying my experience was was check your code from one year ago and if you feel it needs Improvement then then you've grown that's great advice yeah if if you look at code you did from an earlier time and you notice things like oh I I should have done this differently or I can correct that then you know you've learned you know you've improved because obviously when you wrote it you didn't know enough to make it the right way like it should have been so great advice Matt says about two years ago I went on a family vacation to Alaska and to share pictures I set up a website to upload and display photo videos uh think like private Facebook yeah that's a really good idea so that that's a good idea of uh a project to do uh you know if you're interested in something like that thanks for that I I really like that idea I might Matt I might do that that might be a legit idea for me to work on on vacation and not have everybody be mad at me for working on vacation because I'm actually doing something that will contribute to the vacation so that's good I I'm I'm going to share a little personal thing right here uh I hope you don't mind but my wife's I'm going on vacation with all my wife's side of the family so her brothers and their wives and their kids and my mother and fatherinlaw and some of her aunts and and and her uncles so all her side of the family they're very creative and like musically talented so there's always like these times where like okay we're going to have like a talent night like everybody write a story and we're going to read it out to him or uh we're going to we're going to play songs or music and I have no musical ability at all I really like music I like to listen to music but I I can't make music I'm not a good singer like nothing and uh when I hear like I got an email saying we're going to do like a contest about writing a story on vacation and I get like anxiety over that like I don't really want to write the story and to me I'm like can can I just make a website would that work because that makes me excited but the other stuff makes me have anxiety so the the reason why I shared that was I'm thinking maybe instead of me contributing with some musical thing or a story my contribution could be some very useful website uh that can capture that family vacation and everybody can go to it and remember it so uh so Matt thanks for that idea because I might actually do that we'll see I don't want to work all a vacation I really do want to hang out with my family and and my kids but it would be nice to just code a little bit I don't know I just feel if I go for a long time without coding I feel weird like I miss it I don't does anybody else ever get that feeling uh on the negative side I I think like maybe I'm addicted to coding and this is a problem on the positive side I think hey do I found something that I really love to do uh so it could go one way or another depending on how you want to look at it but but I'm interested to see if anybody else feels like that let let me know I suspect somebody else has to feel like that I can't be I can't be the only one and if I am then maybe I do need to get some professional help need to need to talk to a counselor or something um Matt says in in regard to that site that Facebook like site um uh he worked with PHP HTML CSS and JavaScript and getting ready to rewrite it in D Jango uh so he says in my current role I am uh a DBA leading up ajango project to rewrite our main application awesome all right so Rohan says Improvement if I see code from 7 to 10 months ago I feel like killing someone until I realized this was me that's great I I love that that sentiment right so I cringe when I look at old code occasionally I'm pleasantly surprised and I'm like oh this isn't as bad as I thought it would be but sometime usually I'm like I don't even want to look at it I just like all right this site still works like I'm just going to let it go I don't I don't want to revisit this uh pum says that's awesome I haven't had much inspiration and um Andrew I just checked my stuff from a year ago you're right there was definitely improvements thanks all right I'm I'm glad that that we could help um I definitely want this live chat and the community that's starting to develop around it to be a very like positive uplifting Community especially for people who are new uh I think that that's there's a lot of good tutorials and resources for new people uh and I want it to be like that but I think more importantly this could be a place of inspiration and encouragement uh for people that are just starting and for those of us you know that've been doing it for a little longer and maybe just kind of getting a little bit down about things so um that's something that I think you can't get from just reading a tutorial not necess you know you can't necessarily get that uh but in a more like active Living Community like this we can help each other out in that way and um at least for me that's that's if that happens if that's what this ends up being this stream and and all of you that watch and contribute if it ends up being a place that encourages people uh to learn how to code and continue in it uh then I'll be happy and I'll I'll be I'll be happy that I did sacrifice some of the time and the effort to do this uh daf der says what's a good resource for react convention Within in a large project I'm always confused on how much I should put into a single component um I'm sure that you probably get an answer somewhere but in the live chat for this uh dafter but I would say your components should be like as small as possible they should be only like one thing and you you may end up with a ton of components but it's been my understanding that the correct way to do things and react is that like if something can reasonably be broken down into a smaller component then do it uh and then that keeps them it keeps them small it keeps them easy to understand and more modular so that you can reuse them so uh does that make sense let me know if I need to explain that more if that didn't make sense or if if any of you disagree uh with that viewpoint but that's that's my understanding of of ideally how it should work when you're using react um let's see I'm looking we're getting bad yeah we we've hit definitely hit that 10 minutes of where I said I wanted to end so I'm just going to look see if there's any like really important questions I want to get to especially from somebody who's new or maybe just learning uh because I definitely want to uh not that I don't appreciate all of you that are more experienced and and are in the live chat a lot but um I know you won't be offended if I don't get your question I don't want to I don't want to offend somebody if this is their first time asking a question and they get ignored so um let's see so Cactus asks what about markup developer what if you don't want to create markups but you have to do this front and Dev oh so like mockups so you're talking about design work right so uh Cactus correct me if I'm wrong but I think you're talking about design work like what if you have to do design work as a frontend Dev but you don't want to um well I would say either if you can talk to your your boss uh uh about it and see if maybe you can get a real designer or contract that out or something then do it otherwise I mean maybe look for another another job I do have to do design work even though I'm a front end developer I don't always like doing the design work especially at the beginning of a project when it's like a blank slate I'm always that's the worst part for me cuz I could I could make it look like anything you know so it's just hard to make a decision uh but I would imagine I mean how many people watching are frontend developers and also have to do design work uh I know I do for sure I imagine that's somewhat common depending on you know how big a company you work for so um but if if you definitely don't want to be doing that then I would recommend you know try to find a different job or try to bring that up you know in your team and and see if something else could be done you know you may have to keep doing it for a while until you can find something better but uh I mean I totally I'm in the same situation so I definitely understand that um let's see I'm just looking for questions right now usually I do read everything out and uh you all know that if you've seen it before so but um since this is going on pretty long that's why I'm skipping a little bit aim high asks uh hi Jesse so all what you are doing is caching on the server side all your routings on the front end um kind of so yeah basically the once the page loads uh so I did I have had the server up here for a while so what happens is nextjs has I'll go here and show you so in get initial props this fetch of the data happens on the server side so the initial page load and everything it all gets rendered server side and just the HTML you know is pushed out for search engine purposes that's that's good but once the page loads and you click on an internal link then you get no page refresh it's it is it's all client side um routing and the um the API calls that would normally be here and run on the server now can run on the client as well but I am doing a lot of caching so potentially those calls don't even get made if they don't need to so you can see like in the server like I'm caching it for an hour um not in when I'm development minute I don't cash it for an hour but so it's caching the rendered HTML where the API call has already been made on the server they've gotten that data rendered all HTML that's cached so you can get like a really quick response from the server because it it only has to go to the node server and to go right back it doesn't actually have to ask uh WordPress for anything because it's already cached that so that's what I'm doing there and then it does switch over so if if you go to the site kattic uh and check out the uh routing oh man it's so weird I switched to my mouse I'm not on my trackpad now it's really weird to uh try to find all my windows uh but basically yeah if you try to route and you'll notice there is no page refresh so it's a combination of server side and and client side uh rendering routing good question though let me know if you have any other question uh put it in the comments or direct message me on Twitter if you if you want to like talk about it in more depth as to like how how and why I did it Rohan says I'm addicted too got to do something aim high I feel you Jesse okay I'm not the only one um Rohan says uh is saying partic in particular to person but every this goes for everybody that's uh that's watching now live or later on if you want us to help outside of here you can drop by in our IRC anytime so we do have an IRC Channel um for this for this stream and it's uh # FCC Jessie so # FCC Jess so you can join that um I'm in there like occasionally I do I am linked up on my phone so a lot of times I I do get the the messages that come through uh so but I try to pop in you know a couple times a day and there are other people that are in there too so if you need help with something you know come in there and ask some questions or if you're more advanced and you want to help some people come in there and and provide some of your your experience uh Rohan says apart from those uh Patrick uh Jesse and a few other nobody here is even in the neighborhood of awesome I don't I don't think I should be put on the list of awesome either but uh says we can definitely improve I would say the only thing awesome about me is that for some reason I decided it would be a good idea to show the world how much of a noob I am every day uh when I do coding um I don't I don't know that everybody would be able to do that so that's that maybe is something unique about me but uh really you all help me so much uh with with my improving my skills that um I think I'm getting just as much if not more out of this than you are Andrew says now stop posting Jesse will not finish this endless conversation thanks Andrew uh that is true yeah I um I just can't stand to leave questions unanswered if you all have questions you know maybe maybe you really need that question answered it can make a big difference in your life so I just want to answer it but all right but this will be it um last question Rohan asks what would be your next project if you are allowed to reveal it all right let me think what will the next project be I don't know for sure how the order is going to be so I'll tell you maybe one or two that's possible um there's going to be potentially a site that that doesn't really have a name or Ur or anything yet but could possibly aggregate content from all of our other university sites into one place and pull it all in if I do that site I'm going to use the WordPress API because a lot of our sites are running WordPress and I'm going to pull it all in it's going to be a react site it's going to be set up similar to this but of course better because why why do a say site exactly like you did the last one right you want to improve so it'll be similar to this if I do that it'll be cool because I'll get to start right from scratch and show the whole way which I know you know a lot of people have been asking for that to start from scratch so that's one potential project that it's going to happen like I'm like 90% sure what's going to happen I'm just not sure when um the other project that I was working on before this if you look on my YouTube channel I did a couple of live streams where I was trying to do a redesign of our main website franciscan.edu but I was trying to limit it like within the restrictions of the current current content management system that will get replaced so basically I was trying to make that site look nice and run as fast as possible within the constraints that I have to work in so that was kind of a weird situation but made it interesting because I couldn't use a lot of the tools and the techniques that I would like to use because of those constraints so those two projects are for sure happening there might be some little like onepage sites that'll pop in here and there but that that's about as good of an answer as I can give you right now and shoot Andrew did ask one more question and it's a followup to an earlier question so I'm going to take it because technically I don't think it's really new just a clarification uh Andrew is saying so the server side also fetches data from WordPress or is only HTML gets to the front end and then fetches so this is to clarify before from Aim High's question it actually does fetch the data on the server so if you want to test it out I'm not going to do it right now because then I'll be here for another 10 minutes but go to the website on your first load of the website so don't do don't click any links on the first load uh go to view source so don't use the inspector view the source and it you know it'll come up with a really ugly looking white page with HTML you'll be able to see all the data right there right if it was fetching at client side you wouldn't see all the data You' just see the initial markup that gets loaded all right but it's actually making the API call server side first and then sending it all comp all completed and rendered out the way it should look that way search engines see the complete page otherwise search engines wouldn't see all that data that we're pulling from WordPress so that's the main reason why we do it I I have I haven't tested Ted it this myself but I've heard other people say that you get a slightly faster first page load if you do it that way as well so finally gotten to the end of the uh live chat I did go kind of fast at the end so if I missed your question I sincerely apologize and please ask it in the comments or message me on Twitter and I will answer it as soon as I can thank you uh to everybody for watching we had a lot of action in the live chat a lot of viewers uh I think above average for most of the the stream we had above average amount of viewers so thank you so much uh for everything for all the input you all had I'll be back tomorrow same time 2 pm eastern time not sure what the topic will be yet I'll I'll pick it uh tomorrow um and thanks thanks to the two people that submitted pool requests big thanks to vet and was it Daniel I'm going to I'm going to check so that I don't get this wrong shoot and I can't find it because I don't have my trackpad uh I think it was Daniel if it wasn't I'm sorry but the two people that submitted pool requests since yesterday um I really really appreciate that you did an awesome job I I love the requests and it's definitely a big Improvement in the project so uh anyway thanks thanks for watching and uh I'll be back tomorrow have a great day
