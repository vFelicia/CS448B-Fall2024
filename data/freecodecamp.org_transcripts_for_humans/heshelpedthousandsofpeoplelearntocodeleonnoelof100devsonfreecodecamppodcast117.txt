00:28 - the
00:31 - [Music]
00:36 - welcome back to the free Coke Camp
00:38 - podcast I'm Quincy Larsson teacher and
00:40 - founder of freecodecamp.org each week
00:42 - we're bringing you Insight from
00:44 - developers Founders and ambitious people
00:46 - that are getting into Tech today we're
00:48 - talking with Leon Noel who I don't know
00:52 - if you've heard of 100 devs but it's
00:54 - amazing and it's a huge source of
00:55 - inspiration for me personally he is the
00:58 - founder of 100 devs and he head of
01:00 - engineering at resilient
01:02 - coders Leon joining us from Sunny Los
01:07 - Angeles how's everything going with you
01:09 - it's it's a little early we'll see if
01:11 - the sun comes out things are going well
01:13 - uh this is uh surreal experience thank
01:16 - you so much for having me and uh we
01:18 - we'll get weird with it real quick uh I
01:22 - I always joke that like my my wife knows
01:24 - how serious I am if your face is like
01:27 - the background of my like screens or or
01:30 - I've had a picture of you on my desk for
01:32 - a little while uh so she knows if it's
01:34 - go time or not based off of like she's
01:36 - seeing you so uh IM honor it's a huge
01:40 - privilege like this is a dream come true
01:42 - for me uh you're a huge hero of mine and
01:44 - have done so much to help so many folks
01:46 - and uh you're who I want to be when I
01:48 - grow up so I really appreciate it thanks
01:50 - for having me on yeah well I just want
01:52 - to say that it's like very kind uh and I
01:55 - want to say that that goes both ways
01:57 - like uh often when I'm feeling like a
01:59 - little but low energy and I just like ah
02:02 - you know I don't know if I can get a lot
02:03 - done today maybe I'll just you know go
02:05 - and answer a bunch of emails and not um
02:08 - do like curriculum design or or you know
02:11 - I'll I'll I'll go into like the I'm like
02:14 - what would Leon do he would dive in head
02:16 - first he would have so much energy
02:18 - overflowing and he would just go in
02:21 - there and get things done and so uh yeah
02:23 - like I I do think about you a lot when
02:25 - I'm just feeling low energy because I've
02:27 - watched your streams and I've seen the
02:29 - amount of energy
02:30 - both like literal energy like bursting
02:33 - forth and the positive energy that you
02:35 - bring to the community so uh thank you
02:38 - for that and uh I'll make a little meme
02:40 - of you know Wolverine holding the
02:42 - picture frame and then go holding
02:45 - holding the picture of me I won't really
02:47 - do that but like I when you said that
02:49 - that just fell hot in my
02:51 - mind because I love X-Men so um Leon did
02:55 - did you see the new the new announcement
02:58 - 97 what's happened they're redoing the
03:01 - old school cartoon oh my goodness like
03:04 - post Professor X the
03:06 - original 9s Saturday morning all right
03:09 - no more everybody we stop the podcast we
03:12 - go watch the trailer it's really good it
03:14 - looks really good i i l link to the
03:16 - trailer in a little bit of tears in my
03:18 - eyes when there's a specific catchphrase
03:20 - that is said but
03:22 - yeah okay uh I'm going to link to that
03:25 - be sure to watch that immediately after
03:26 - you finish watching or listening to this
03:29 - podcast interview because we've got a
03:30 - ton of advice that's practical and not
03:32 - just you know something that you can do
03:34 - to escape from your day-to-day
03:36 - experience but to build up your
03:38 - day-to-day experience and accomplish
03:40 - your goals so Leon before we dive into
03:44 - 100 devs uh and Brazilian coders and all
03:46 - the work you've done uh I like to always
03:49 - start these interviews with more
03:51 - autobiographical stuff just so people
03:53 - can have context into like who you are
03:55 - your lived experience uh where you're
03:57 - coming from and where you're heading and
03:59 - things like that so maybe you could take
04:01 - us back to uh where you grew up and like
04:04 - what your earliest Ambitions were as a
04:07 - kid yeah so uh I grew up in Philly um
04:11 - definitely 100% a product of Philly I
04:13 - was always kind of the very kind of
04:16 - tinkering wanting to build type of kid
04:19 - uh I grew up with a a huge household a a
04:22 - big family uh all in one uh row home in
04:25 - South Philly which was amazing and uh I
04:28 - was blessed to have amazing libraries
04:31 - where I had access to computers and
04:34 - could tinker and build and uh I was very
04:37 - blessed even have a lot of even just
04:39 - Computer Science Education early
04:41 - throughout my life I had a q basic class
04:44 - in middle school where I would get a
04:46 - sailboat to go from one side of the
04:48 - screen to the other I thought it had
04:49 - magical powers and so I was very lucky
04:52 - to have these skills so so early uh we
04:56 - also in Philly have magnet schools which
04:58 - are kind of like EXA schools that you
05:00 - test into and so I went to engineering
05:02 - and science where I had two years of
05:05 - C++ in high school and this is like 20
05:08 - years ago and so yeah I just I'm very
05:11 - lucky to have grown up in an environment
05:15 - that supported my passions and interest
05:19 - even when I didn't have access to those
05:21 - Technologies or knowledge that there was
05:24 - a way for me to get access to it so very
05:26 - very thankful for that that's awesome
05:29 - yeah that that's it sounds like a really
05:31 - kind of like adelic upbringing in the
05:33 - sense that like you've got access to
05:37 - what about teachers did you have any
05:39 - teachers as a kid who like really
05:40 - propelled you forward I always talk very
05:43 - passionately about my um my seventh
05:46 - grade teacher uh or eighth grade teacher
05:49 - uh science teacher Mr creger um whom
05:51 - I've failed to track down if you know Mr
05:54 - creger who taught at uh you know Hoover
05:58 - Middle School which was is is like a now
06:01 - destroyed bulldozed um School in
06:04 - Oklahoma City if anybody's heard of that
06:06 - person let me know but uh did you have
06:08 - anybody like a Mr creger in your life
06:10 - who was eccentric and interesting but
06:13 - kept giving you like interesting books
06:14 - about space and stuff like that yeah so
06:16 - i' I've have been lucky to have a few um
06:19 - so miss franchine was my fifth grade
06:22 - teacher that when I was done my
06:25 - coursework would not let me just sit
06:27 - there twiddling my thumbs but always had
06:29 - like puzzles and things to build and
06:31 - Tinker with in the background and
06:33 - likewise I've tried to find them I
06:35 - haven't been able to find them but they
06:37 - really kind of showed me that I could be
06:40 - in control of my learning that it wasn't
06:43 - a a one-way depositing of knowledge that
06:46 - I could have some sort of control or
06:48 - command over the things I was doing with
06:50 - my free time that would enable me to
06:52 - think creatively and and to do the
06:54 - things I wanted to do uh I had a lot of
06:58 - wonderful folks throughout High school
06:59 - that really helped guide me um that
07:02 - pushed me that uh maybe saw something
07:05 - inside of me that I didn't see inside of
07:06 - myself and would try and pull that out
07:09 - my we're talking about like code
07:11 - education Shout Out Mr shipper would uh
07:14 - push me to learn my my C++ and we had
07:18 - the old school like Matrix printers
07:21 - where you'd print out your code on them
07:23 - and and I would look through it and take
07:25 - it to them and try to point out bugs or
07:27 - errors and you talk about folks in your
07:30 - life that do like the small things right
07:33 - and Mr shipper every every birthday for
07:36 - years and years would just send me like
07:38 - a happy birthday message so talking
07:40 - about folks that just support you long
07:42 - term uh that was there and then in
07:45 - University it was Dr Bri esus the person
07:48 - that showed me that I could be what I
07:51 - wanted to be and supported my ability to
07:55 - learn supported what I wanted to do made
07:58 - sure that I had funding over the summer
08:01 - to like live uh made sure that I got to
08:04 - do the research I wanted to do and
08:06 - ultimately gave me the the skills that I
08:09 - thought I needed to be the person I
08:12 - wanted to be in life and so yeah
08:13 - definitely the product of amazing
08:16 - teachers throughout my entire life and
08:18 - definitely something that I try to think
08:20 - of with resilient coders and uh 100 devs
08:25 - like what what was about those folks
08:27 - that inspired me to to do more to learn
08:30 - to feel comfortable and try and bring
08:33 - that into the classroom as well yeah
08:35 - yeah it's so cool to talk with another
08:37 - teacher because obviously you're a
08:38 - software engineer but you're also a
08:40 - teacher to many many people not
08:42 - necessarily in the conventional way uh
08:45 - maybe in the conventional way too maybe
08:47 - you actually give lectures occasionally
08:49 - in person but like through 100 devs
08:51 - you're essentially like the classroom
08:53 - teacher that people need you know like
08:56 - yeah you know the the bat signals up in
08:58 - the air the the 100 Dev signal and and
09:01 - you're answering that call and you're
09:02 - helping people uh with the not just uh
09:05 - practical challenges of learning to code
09:07 - but the motivational challenges as well
09:10 - and that's that's a huge thing I take
09:11 - away from your Stream So sounds uh like
09:14 - you went on to do really well
09:17 - academically uh I presume because you
09:19 - went to one of the best universities in
09:21 - the world uh maybe you could talk a
09:24 - little bit about like what that process
09:26 - was like what what is it like getting
09:28 - into a relatively Elite cool and um you
09:32 - know like was that how long did you have
09:35 - that plan at what age did you kind of
09:36 - like Snap to awareness I always like to
09:38 - tell people like I kind of snapped to
09:40 - awareness much later in life uh I was
09:42 - maybe like 20 21 and that's when I like
09:45 - got really into like journalism and
09:48 - studying foreign languages and stuff
09:49 - like themes that would kind of run
09:52 - throughout the rest of my life living
09:53 - abroad and and and ultimately like much
09:55 - later I had kind of like a second thing
09:56 - where I learned like technology is
09:58 - really really gosh darn useful like and
10:02 - uh that's when I I learned to code and
10:03 - like automated stuff from my school and
10:05 - stuff but like did you have like an
10:07 - early kind of Awakening at some point do
10:09 - you remember a a distinct period of your
10:11 - life where you're like hey you know I
10:13 - can do a lot more than other people
10:17 - around me are doing my my peers was
10:19 - there such an Awakening for
10:21 - you yeah I think I I want it to be
10:26 - comfortable I wanted to have um a good
10:30 - life and I think early on especially as
10:34 - like a kid of color you're kind of
10:36 - taught this very it's just like Dr lur
10:38 - dentist it comes up over and over and
10:39 - over again and it comes from
10:43 - maybe our families and the folks in our
10:46 - community not
10:48 - knowing kind of all of the opportunities
10:51 - that are available but that those are
10:52 - the safe Pathways the Dr La dentist and
10:55 - so yeah for hundreds of years yeah
10:58 - hundreds years yeah so it's it's proven
10:59 - so that's kind of the path that I got
11:01 - put on as someone that who was
11:03 - successful pretty early academically I
11:05 - did well in elementary school I got I
11:08 - used to have to go from my school to
11:09 - another school every week to do like
11:11 - other programs and I
11:14 - saw how
11:17 - hard my grandparents had to work I saw
11:21 - how hard my grandfather worked
11:22 - specifically uh in a boiler room every
11:25 - day it was hot they were pulling Valves
11:28 - and I saw what Hardware could
11:32 - do and I wanted to do
11:36 - something that would enable me to have a
11:40 - good life but maybe not be so sweaty
11:44 - right and so the the that idea led me to
11:48 - look into Dr l dentist Dr l dentist
11:51 - and as I went through Middle School I
11:55 - was very focused on getting into one of
11:58 - our magnet schools so Philly has some
12:00 - amazing schools that you kind of test in
12:02 - and it's more of like a lottery now too
12:04 - as well and I went to engineering and
12:06 - science and engineering and science was
12:08 - geared around getting folks into
12:10 - engineering and Science and had tracks
12:13 - that you could follow and a really good
12:16 - placement rate into universities and so
12:20 - for a while my sophomore junior senior
12:23 - year pretty much every lunch period was
12:25 - spent with Miss Brown who's my guidance
12:28 - counselor
12:29 - and would make sure that I was getting
12:32 - access to everything I needed to do well
12:35 - academically and to get into really good
12:37 - schools and coming from a low-income
12:39 - family it's really expensive so Miss
12:42 - Brown would U make sure that I
12:46 - had vouchers for everything that I could
12:50 - take the SAT for free that I could apply
12:53 - to schools for free that would get me
12:55 - into all the best summer programs that
12:58 - could help me academically I was a I did
13:01 - upper Bound for a while um made sure I
13:04 - had access to things that I didn't like
13:06 - calculators and things like that and so
13:09 - my school I owe a lot too in terms of
13:12 - getting me prepared um for eventually
13:15 - what I would go to is Yale and so for me
13:19 - I think I've just been really blessed to
13:22 - be the product of a school system that
13:26 - if I wanted it if I wanted to work hard
13:28 - if I wanted to put in the hours and I
13:30 - played three Sports I did every Club
13:32 - imaginable but I had really amazing
13:34 - people that guided me through that
13:36 - process and then uh was able to to make
13:40 - it from from ens into Yale and then um
13:44 - went into hard sciences and was on this
13:47 - track to be a a doctor right I I Dr La
13:50 - dentist I chose doctor uh my mom was uh
13:54 - uh an LPN and um I got to grow up in do
13:59 - offices and see and and talk to folks
14:02 - and that was kind of the path I was on
14:04 - and it's kind of funny because I was
14:06 - doing computer science I was in an
14:08 - engineering high school and I just
14:10 - didn't allow myself to see that as my
14:13 - path or my career even though that's
14:15 - where eventually I should have been or
14:17 - and eventually did make it to and so
14:20 - that's kind of the the long winding path
14:22 - into yeah awesome and LPN is licensed
14:25 - practitioner licensed practicing nurse
14:28 - yeah it's like a vocation nurse
14:29 - basically so instead of doing now I
14:32 - guess the track is like your bachelors
14:34 - and you get like your RN this was a
14:36 - vocational pathway okay to being a nurse
14:38 - yeah yeah yeah I just want to make sure
14:40 - I got that right and I have like this
14:42 - policy that like no matter how common
14:44 - the acronym is I always try to like
14:46 - spell it out uh for especially for our
14:47 - listeners abroad non native English
14:49 - speaker listeners as well um uh so okay
14:53 - so just recapitulate something that I've
14:56 - been taking detailed notice as you talk
14:58 - just because this is so so interesting
14:59 - and I um I'll email these to myself
15:02 - these are not for publiction but it's
15:04 - basically the contents of this
15:05 - conversation is public now so
15:08 - um it sounds like it you didn't it just
15:11 - didn't even click it didn't even really
15:13 - occur to you that software engineering
15:15 - was a field you could go into because
15:16 - like so many people coming from
15:19 - underprivileged backgrounds so many you
15:22 - know second generation immigrants or
15:23 - even first generation immigrants so many
15:25 - people growing up who are kind of still
15:27 - in the shadow of
15:29 - inequality like racial inequality that's
15:33 - systemic that is the reason one of the
15:35 - reasons why you know wealth among black
15:37 - families is like something like one/
15:40 - tenth of like white families that have
15:42 - been in the US the same duration of time
15:44 - I mean it's like ridiculous but because
15:47 - of these
15:48 - circumstances uh you were pushed to do
15:50 - Dr lawyer dentist and again like most of
15:55 - my doctors dentists that I haven't had
15:58 - any lawyers that
15:59 - uh like over the years have been people
16:02 - who came from a different country like
16:05 - their parents came from a different
16:06 - country or the in many cases as doctors
16:08 - they literally came from like India past
16:10 - the US mle which is this incredibly
16:12 - stringent test ESS like recertified as
16:15 - doctors a very lengthy costly process uh
16:18 - just so they could practice in the US
16:20 - because the US is like you know a great
16:22 - place to live and it's a great place to
16:24 - work as a physician uh generally I I
16:26 - guess I shouldn't speak for all there
16:27 - may be some physicians in the audience
16:29 - to take issue with that because of
16:30 - regulatory you know issues and like all
16:33 - this other stuff but my point is you
16:37 - were so focused on that because that is
16:39 - what success sounded like uh that like
16:42 - that was like the family's perception of
16:44 - success and software engineer is like a
16:46 - relatively new thing that is you know
16:48 - not well understood and it's not a
16:51 - surprise because software engineering
16:52 - has only existed a few decades right
16:54 - yeah um maybe you could talk about like
16:57 - what that Awakening to software
17:00 - engineering was like and how you went
17:01 - about okay I'm GNA go much deeper on
17:05 - coding and learning about computer
17:07 - science and math like all these things
17:08 - that you need to be a successful
17:11 - software engineer um now now I you may
17:15 - take issue with me saying like you need
17:16 - a whole lot of math for example or
17:17 - something like that I don't think that's
17:19 - necessarily true for a lot of jobs but I
17:21 - I always tell people like there is no
17:23 - knowledge that is not power like you
17:25 - should definitely learn math if if you
17:27 - have the time it's probably not the
17:28 - highest priority if you just want to go
17:29 - get a job as a developer Sor right uh
17:31 - but my question for You Leon mathematics
17:34 - all right a complete introduction right
17:36 - on okay so uh I'm glad to hear that like
17:40 - yeah because a lot of times I hear like
17:41 - I think one of the pieces of
17:42 - misinformation that's going around is
17:44 - like oh you don't need math to be a
17:45 - developer like I don't know any math
17:47 - like I just took high school math and
17:48 - I'm a developer and like that is true to
17:51 - an extent but there is kind of like a
17:52 - ceiling that you're going to hit in your
17:54 - engineering career if you don't like at
17:56 - least take some time to learn some
17:58 - mathem matics and you can learn
17:59 - mathematics right here on Freo Camp's
18:01 - YouTube channel we have courses on
18:03 - pretty much every engineering math topic
18:06 - that you would learned at like an
18:08 - undergraduate engineering program so uh
18:11 - you know it's just investment of time
18:14 - and that's a big thing we'll talk about
18:15 - in a little bit is like isn't really
18:17 - free in the sense that you have to
18:18 - invest your time and energy and not
18:21 - everybody has equal time and energy some
18:23 - people have all kinds of different
18:25 - circumstances that inform their
18:27 - availability to learn the code yeah so
18:29 - we'll talk about that in a minute but
18:30 - like how did you approach this and like
18:32 - maybe how old were you were were you
18:34 - still in school when you realized that
18:35 - you wanted to do
18:36 - CS yeah so
18:38 - [Music]
18:40 - I was always building so when I started
18:44 - in sixth grade I learned Q basic and I
18:48 - would go to the libraries and tinker and
18:50 - build when I was in high school Upward
18:52 - Bound got me a TI 83 Plus calculator
18:56 - which I still have it's like in my
18:57 - drawer over here some where and you
19:01 - could write code for that calculator and
19:03 - I remember swapping I felt like it was
19:05 - like old school you know like how people
19:06 - used to swap floppies I would swap the
19:09 - games and programs from the calculator
19:13 - and go to the library and like I I
19:15 - remember the thing I wanted for one
19:17 - Christmas was like the cable that
19:19 - connected the the calculator to the
19:22 - computer so that I could like put my
19:24 - code on it and so uh I remember very
19:27 - early working on
19:29 - calculator games and other fun stuff
19:31 - that I just wanted to to bring into the
19:33 - world or modify and hack God and so that
19:35 - was always really fun and then I had
19:38 - that kind of formal C++ in high school
19:41 - and then when I got to University it all
19:43 - went out the window I was doing hard
19:45 - biology uh I was doing U eventually
19:48 - biological anthropology I was looking at
19:50 - hormones testas and stuff like that but
19:52 - this entire time I'd always been
19:54 - building tinkering I really liked
19:57 - entrepreneurship I was always trying to
19:59 - start ideas small companies uh things
20:02 - like that and I had started um one kind
20:06 - of simple project that went pretty viral
20:10 - in in New Haven New York area um and
20:13 - that kind of really showed me some of
20:15 - the power of these skills that I've been
20:16 - kind of accumulating but the real kind
20:19 - of Awakening for me for computer science
20:22 - was uh every summer I was doing lab work
20:25 - and I had figured out how to like
20:28 - survive
20:29 - uh when you're lowincome going into like
20:31 - an Ivy League school basically they give
20:34 - you a full ride right off the rip and so
20:36 - I had figured out that if I didn't live
20:38 - on campus they would give me like
20:41 - whatever the amount of money was to stay
20:44 - on campus they would give me and I was
20:46 - able to use that to like do stuff I
20:48 - would pay rent and food but I was happy
20:51 - eating pasta and pasta sauce and so I
20:53 - actually had money to like live and and
20:55 - do all the things that all my my fellow
20:57 - students were doing because i' had
20:58 - figured out this like way of doing it um
21:01 - but I ran out of money one summer and it
21:04 - was getting pretty dicey pretty quickly
21:06 - I I really didn't have any money for
21:07 - food left and I was literally hungry and
21:11 - I realized that I I could do things like
21:14 - I was looking up like quick jobs and
21:16 - then I was like wait a minute let me let
21:17 - me see if I can build somebody a website
21:19 - I know how to do it I've been building
21:20 - all these like landing pages and and
21:22 - small things with code before so I put
21:24 - on Craigslist hey I'll build you a site
21:26 - I can get it done today and somebody
21:29 - responded and they paid a deposit
21:33 - and my life changed from that moment I I
21:36 - skipped all the way to the grocery store
21:38 - I bought my pasta I bought my pasta
21:40 - sauce for the month I built them the
21:42 - site and in that moment something very
21:45 - clear happened in my brain that I had a
21:48 - real skill uh a skill that could provide
21:51 - that could put food on the table a skill
21:53 - that would make it so I was never
21:56 - [ __ ] hungry again sorry oops sorry
21:58 - chis uh it's cool again yeah if anybody
22:02 - like like we don't edit this podcast at
22:04 - all so I'm not going to edit out the
22:05 - square word that's like a unless there's
22:07 - like something really bad that happens
22:09 - like I had a coughing fit
22:12 - once and so that that changed everything
22:15 - um until this day I still freelance and
22:18 - I that's the reason why a lot of the
22:20 - things I do today the the resilient
22:22 - coders the 100 DS is like I want anybody
22:24 - that's ever felt that way to know that
22:27 - there is this option this ability to to
22:29 - develop skills that no one can take away
22:31 - from you that can put legitimate food on
22:34 - the table and so that's when I kind of
22:36 - went all in on more of the engineering
22:39 - piece awesome yeah well um that sounds
22:43 - like an amazing discovery of like powers
22:45 - that you just had Laten within you that
22:48 - necessity brought forth you know
22:49 - necessity is the mother of invention
22:52 - right uh you were forced to basically by
22:55 - your circumstance to like think outside
22:57 - the proverbial box come up with a way to
22:59 - to get money to buy your pasta um I you
23:03 - know I definitely uh remember the lean
23:06 - College here is subsisting off pasta we
23:08 - got the smack Ramen if anybody like not
23:11 - the good like sh ramun like Korean Ramen
23:13 - but like it was just called
23:15 - smack we'd always joke about it like
23:18 - when you're hungry enough it's almost
23:19 - like you know like a drug because it's
23:22 - just like you feel so sated afterward
23:25 - course like terrible for you but what
23:27 - kind of pasta did you always just like
23:29 - did you have a particular like build of
23:31 - pasta that you liked uh I this is like
23:34 - way back whatever the cheapest was I was
23:37 - I was trying to survive I didn't care
23:38 - nowadays I probably have some
23:39 - preferences but back then whatever
23:41 - whatever was on sale whatever is the
23:43 - cheapest uh there was the supermarket
23:44 - nearest had like this like clearance
23:46 - aisle and in that clearance aisle they
23:48 - would put like the stuff they couldn't
23:49 - sell and so whatever was on that that
23:51 - rack is what I I would grab yeah yeah uh
23:55 - and and to this day by the way like a
23:57 - lot of grocery stores like Walmart like
23:59 - they'll take their baked goods and
24:00 - they'll put them on a rack like right by
24:02 - the like exit like the staff only place
24:05 - where they have like the garbage
24:06 - compactor where they compact the boxes
24:08 - like I I worked in a grocery stores for
24:09 - a few years so basically back where they
24:11 - keep all the mops and they keep all the
24:13 - you know inventory shelves there will be
24:14 - like a little rack and sometimes they'll
24:16 - have baked goods they're like it's still
24:18 - good but we can't really sell it because
24:20 - it's going to expire in like a day or
24:21 - two so like I sto snacks and Bargains
24:24 - from there uh but but yeah just Pro tip
24:26 - if you're going to a US uh grocery store
24:30 - you can often find like food that's
24:31 - about to expire that you can get like at
24:33 - a heavy discount so um that's really
24:36 - cool so how did things unfold from there
24:38 - so how did you um how did you go from
24:42 - that first contract work essentially
24:44 - that that client that you landed through
24:46 - Craigslist which is how I land I think I
24:48 - landed some early clients through
24:49 - Craigslist Craigslist amazing tool I'm
24:51 - not sure if it's still amazing today
24:53 - like 12 years since I last used it but
24:56 - yeah uh yeah like a lot of early G were
24:58 - found on Craigslist how did you go from
25:00 - that
25:01 - to the deciding I am a Dev like taking
25:04 - that identity if you will and going
25:08 - deeper with it yeah sure so um my junior
25:13 - year at Yale I started a small website
25:18 - called List full of hope it was kind of
25:20 - like a reverse Craigslist where uh if
25:23 - you needed something you could say what
25:25 - you needed so if you needed a jacket and
25:27 - someone in the area had a jacket jacket
25:28 - you would meet up and they would give
25:29 - you a jacket so it was kind of like a
25:31 - gift economy um it was very simple site
25:34 - that was just enabling folks to help
25:36 - others in their community and it really
25:39 - kind of popped off in New Haven and so
25:41 - there was the one winter where it was
25:43 - like really popular I remember people
25:45 - getting Christmas presents jackets
25:47 - gloves anything you needed um and I
25:50 - could really see that transition from
25:52 - something that was like just a raw skill
25:54 - to like me having to build an actual
25:56 - application and having real users and I
25:59 - was hooked like I could I saw the power
26:01 - I saw that it could help so many people
26:03 - and I knew that these skills would be
26:05 - really advantageous to keep going so my
26:08 - junior year I kind of slowly stopped
26:10 - kind of really wanting to do coursework
26:13 - senior year it became an even bigger
26:15 - problem and I was trying to finish my
26:18 - thesis to to graduate and I had to get
26:22 - like 300 men to spit in a tube tell me
26:26 - about their sexual history so I could
26:28 - correlate it to their testosterone
26:29 - levels I was trying to like show that um
26:34 - or find something about BPA and relation
26:36 - to testosterone so you drank a lot of
26:38 - like plastic water bottles yeah and so I
26:41 - was trying to do that before before it
26:42 - became really popular like something
26:44 - people would actually think about free
26:45 - plastic which for the kids like just in
26:48 - case D does have like deleterious
26:50 - effects we don't want our kids to be
26:51 - drinking from so I was having a really
26:54 - hard time running that that experiment
26:57 - and uh apparently people didn't want to
26:59 - you know spit in a tube and tell me
27:01 - about their sexual history for like a
27:03 - bottle of Gatorade and like a pack of
27:04 - gum or something and so uh I wasn't able
27:07 - to recruit enough people for that
27:08 - experiment and I decided to use my like
27:12 - coding skills to set up it was just like
27:15 - a landing page where a lot of students
27:18 - were always trying to find studies or
27:20 - experiments to participate in because
27:21 - one they were a lot of fun sometimes and
27:23 - you actually got paid pretty well to do
27:25 - the experiments and so there is one
27:27 - really famous One that people loved
27:29 - where you basically went to a lab they
27:31 - got you drunk and you played poker and
27:33 - they're just like watching you like how
27:34 - you make risky decisions and things like
27:36 - that and you got paid a couple hundred
27:38 - dollars to do it wow and so I made a
27:40 - landing page that had all the studies
27:42 - from Yale Harvard Princeton that were
27:44 - like trying to get people to come and I
27:47 - just slipped mine in there and it took
27:50 - off because we had all these professors
27:51 - that were promoting it we had all these
27:53 - students that got real value they went
27:55 - to the site they found something fun to
27:56 - do they got money and and um I dropped
27:59 - out my senior year to turn that into a
28:03 - business um which became social sigh and
28:06 - um we wound up building academic
28:09 - surveying tools we had over 4,000
28:12 - different universities that used our
28:13 - tools to power their academic research
28:16 - uh and even though that company has been
28:17 - wrapped up for a long time now we still
28:19 - have research that gets published based
28:21 - off of the data that they collected I
28:24 - needed to know more my Engineers had
28:27 - these like magical powers and I needed
28:30 - to to like learn that skill for myself
28:32 - and so I took my coding education more
28:36 - seriously uh eventually uh I was
28:39 - building other products other startups
28:41 - as well and and started teaching at
28:43 - General Assembly helping others kind of
28:45 - acquire these skills too so that was
28:47 - kind of the the journey it's interesting
28:49 - so first of all congratulations on
28:51 - building something that 4,000
28:53 - universities use it's not easy to get
28:56 - universities to use your stuff like
28:58 - there's like this notorious like sales
29:00 - cycle adoption cycle among universities
29:03 - they're they're very like slow to adopt
29:06 - new tools um yeah I mean that's that's
29:09 - phenomenal to go from basically like
29:11 - Mechanical Turk for being a human test
29:13 - subject to having like an
29:16 - actual project that is getting wide
29:19 - usage like that that's really funny that
29:21 - you bring up Mechanical Turk that was
29:23 - the reason why we were able to raise
29:24 - like VC funding was because M Turk was
29:28 - becoming more popular um and what social
29:30 - size saw was not just the the survey
29:34 - creation but the participants taking the
29:37 - surveys and so part of my pitch deck and
29:40 - I'll never forget it was I decided to
29:42 - get my mom a Christmas card and I had
29:45 - people on mtk like just like hold up
29:48 - like the the merry Christmas sign and
29:51 - what we had was this one person with a
29:54 - hundred different like not 100 but like
29:55 - a lot of different accounts that was
29:57 - just like Chang ing their hat putting on
29:59 - a different shirt but it was like
30:00 - clearly the same person and so at this
30:03 - point Mechanical Turk hadn't solved the
30:05 - like identity online and like how do you
30:08 - stop like false participants and that
30:10 - was kind of why we were able to be um
30:13 - able to raise money and why we were able
30:14 - to have so many universities trust and
30:16 - use our service because we were solving
30:18 - that problem specifically so was your
30:20 - mom like who is this person and why are
30:22 - they so you know passionate about like
30:25 - wishing me a happy birthday it was cool
30:27 - there was like 100 people from all over
30:29 - the world with like different
30:31 - backgrounds different cities different
30:33 - places and they all were saying Merry
30:34 - Christmas now you could probably
30:36 - facilitate that but back when we did it
30:38 - it was yeah it was pretty cool yeah and
30:41 - mechanical turque just for people that
30:43 - are unfamiliar with it is like they call
30:45 - it artificial artificial intelligence
30:47 - obviously nowadays like a lot of things
30:49 - you would pay someone on mechanical TK
30:51 - to do you just like form out to like an
30:53 - llm or something but it was like um like
30:57 - hey I need you like early on it was like
30:59 - hey I need you to solve a capture for me
31:01 - or hey I need you to create a Facebook
31:03 - account and like like this this Facebook
31:05 - group or something like that was like
31:06 - basically getting around the
31:08 - restrictions that different like
31:09 - platforms might have in place uh but uh
31:12 - event but you know in the good like as
31:15 - designed use would be for example
31:18 - getting people to do precisely what Leon
31:20 - said so uh it was everybody would get
31:23 - like maybe just like a few pennies for
31:25 - doing a a hit I think or job or
31:28 - something I can't remember what they
31:29 - were called but uh yeah you you would do
31:32 - those is that accurate like I haven't
31:34 - actually used it yeah no that that's
31:35 - that's pretty close uh there was it's
31:37 - this whole subfield called human
31:39 - computation right so human computation
31:41 - there's there's some things that
31:44 - computers can't yet do that humans can
31:48 - still do but figuring out how to do them
31:49 - at scale um is really important and so
31:52 - Mechanical Turk you can take an a task
31:55 - break it down into a very small subtask
31:57 - and have thousands and thousands of
31:59 - people do it need for human computation
32:02 - is like labeling data think of like AI
32:04 - training and things like that who were
32:06 - the people like there had to be real
32:07 - people that said that was a a fired hose
32:11 - or that was a car or that was a bicycle
32:13 - that's a Chihuahua and not a muffin
32:16 - exactly that's like a famous like
32:17 - chihuahuas look a lot like muffins to a
32:19 - computer and so figuring out all of that
32:24 - was necessary for a lot of the
32:25 - advancements that we're seeing now and
32:27 - there are still things that humans can
32:29 - do very quickly that machines just can't
32:30 - do yet and so um M Turk still has like a
32:34 - place um there are other companies that
32:35 - do similar things nowadays of course but
32:38 - that labeling and small tasks done at
32:41 - scale and there are other cool things
32:42 - you can do too so where it's like um
32:45 - instead of giving it to just one person
32:46 - you give it to five and if four out of
32:48 - the five do one thing you know that you
32:51 - can probably trust that thing as opposed
32:52 - to the one person that did it as opposed
32:54 - to The Minority Report yeah the
32:56 - dissenting uh the asentic opinion yeah
32:59 - that that's a good kind of consensus
33:00 - mechanism so um Okay cool so you built
33:03 - this project we could talk about that a
33:05 - lot more but we have so much more to
33:07 - talk about like where do you go from
33:08 - there you you basically had a successful
33:11 - project right like everybody's dream
33:13 - especially at this point sounds like you
33:15 - were pretty young like yeah like had you
33:18 - finished college at this point like I I
33:20 - so I dropped out and never finished um
33:22 - oh wow and my senior year at Yale um I
33:25 - had this idea for social sigh I dropped
33:28 - out I did Tech Stars um techar is an
33:32 - accelerator popular like they they give
33:34 - you some some seed money and then you're
33:36 - in like a program where they kind of
33:37 - Coach you exactly they help you yeah
33:40 - exactly they help you lay the foundation
33:43 - for a company and all the skills you
33:45 - might need to know to to do that
33:46 - effectively uh techstars really changed
33:49 - my life it really gave me a lot of the
33:50 - skills that I was missing um gave me my
33:53 - initial Network outside of University
33:55 - and yeah initial seed funding and then
33:57 - helped me going to raise more funds for
33:59 - for social sigh and yeah while I was
34:01 - running social sigh I started teaching
34:04 - uh a general assembly and so general
34:06 - assembly is one of the first like really
34:08 - big uh coding boot camp programs and I
34:12 - was doing their part-time courses for a
34:14 - very long time I'm distinguished faculty
34:16 - with uh GA even until today and I was
34:20 - having just hundreds if not thousands of
34:23 - people be successful like learning these
34:26 - new skills learning how to code getting
34:28 - great jobs and at one point it kind of
34:32 - just got overwhelming that I didn't
34:35 - notice anyone that looked like me taking
34:38 - advantage of this program one because it
34:40 - cost a lot of money it also cost a lot
34:43 - of time um and so I started looking for
34:46 - orgs uh near me in Boston that I
34:50 - could help or support and I came across
34:53 - resilient coders which at that time our
34:56 - founder David delmare I was really
34:58 - trying to work with court involved Youth
35:01 - and show them that hey like there are
35:02 - these things you could be doing like
35:03 - coding or things like that that might
35:05 - help you longterm in life and so I
35:08 - started just going to we had what are
35:10 - called Community hours where it was just
35:12 - myself a few other mentors and a bunch
35:15 - of young folks that um were typically
35:18 - court involved or or a returning Citizen
35:21 - and just trying to like give them these
35:22 - skills and then um we had the idea of
35:26 - starting a boot camp and uh our founder
35:30 - dve dmar said hey like you've been
35:31 - running these other boot camp programs
35:33 - could you do it for RC said yes and then
35:37 - for the past six years we've built a
35:39 - program that can help folks uh
35:42 - traditionally of color that have um
35:46 - particularly not completed a degree go
35:49 - from zero to employable as a soft
35:51 - engineer and we've been pretty
35:53 - successful at it we've helped hundreds
35:54 - of folks get jobs um and with starting
35:57 - salaries around
35:59 - $992,000 and for us that's huge because
36:03 - for each person we can get from those
36:05 - communities we're talking about millions
36:07 - and millions of dollars back into those
36:09 - communities over the lifespan of their
36:10 - career so started doing uh resilient
36:13 - coders that eventually led me to 100
36:15 - devs and that's kind of the the Long Way
36:17 - Forward I want to dive a little more
36:18 - into because we're going to talk a lot
36:20 - about 100 devs but like uh Brazilian
36:23 - coders you you said uh court involved
36:25 - youth uh I'm I'm not familiar with term
36:27 - but like you know I have lots of friends
36:29 - who are like convicted felons and I'm
36:31 - not sure if that if that is essentially
36:33 - like people who early on in life uh get
36:37 - into trouble maybe because they actually
36:39 - did something wrong or maybe they were
36:41 - profiled in like the the very unequal
36:43 - justice system in the United States
36:46 - didn't do its job very well and and you
36:48 - know gave them much harsher penalty than
36:51 - that kid should probably have in many
36:53 - cases uh
36:55 - but uh is that like accurate is like
36:58 - yeah so we had a lot of individuals that
37:01 - we say court involved because exactly of
37:03 - the things that you brought up a lot of
37:05 - the folks that we were working with they
37:07 - didn't do anything wrong uh and they
37:10 - were just at the wrong place the wrong
37:11 - time um we did have folks that um had
37:14 - gone down a different path in life to do
37:16 - the things they needed to do provide for
37:18 - themselves and their families and so we
37:20 - wanted to give them a clear path forward
37:23 - to do the the thing with their loved
37:25 - ones and so we trying to get them skills
37:28 - just skills that they could put into
37:29 - practice to to to get to a point to
37:33 - where they had a a strong stable high
37:35 - growth career and and that's that's kind
37:37 - of the birth of RC and our our our Dirty
37:41 - Little Secret that um I guess some folks
37:44 - know is that the first dollars we ever
37:46 - took in were from the Boston Police
37:47 - Department uh because they saw our
37:50 - program as hey we're going to spend all
37:51 - this money on incarceration
37:54 - Rehabilitation um why not get ahead of
37:58 - it and they gave us some funding to help
38:00 - run our first boot camp yeah that's
38:02 - awesome well it sounds like it was money
38:04 - well spent uh given the uh impact you
38:06 - all have had over the past six years I
38:08 - think you said um so so you got
38:12 - resilient coders going you're teaching
38:14 - there um and there it sounds like you're
38:17 - having a big impact but was there a
38:19 - moment where you're like I can have an
38:21 - even bigger impact by leveraging the
38:23 - power of the internet like what was the
38:25 - process that and and maybe I can back up
38:28 - a second and just say what is 100 devs
38:31 - yeah sure uh so 100 devs is a collection
38:35 - of Engineers that help build a
38:38 - completely free live software
38:41 - engineering training program for anyone
38:44 - anywhere uh that was kind of our our
38:46 - Genesis now we're also building and
38:49 - we're going to be piloting this year a
38:51 - full service digital agency where real
38:54 - clients come to us to build products
38:58 - and get to tap into our amazing alumni
39:00 - that have gone on to work at some of the
39:02 - best tech companies in the world we're
39:04 - talking Amazon LinkedIn slack You Name
39:07 - It We have an alumni there they come
39:08 - back to work on these projects uh each
39:11 - Project's getting broken down in
39:12 - individual tasks and then as you're
39:15 - learning you're also building real code
39:17 - for real companies and getting paid
39:20 - actual money to do it um we mentioned
39:23 - early on that free isn't always free
39:26 - because it requires you to have an
39:28 - extreme privilege of time to work
39:30 - through all this material to give up
39:32 - your nights and weekends and we want to
39:34 - do something that helps soften the blow
39:36 - for folks that are going through our
39:38 - program so our program is entirely free
39:41 - uh every resource I have ever given out
39:44 - is always free I don't work with anybody
39:46 - that doesn't have a free version or
39:48 - something that we can have access to but
39:51 - we did a poll not too long ago that said
39:54 - hey we realize a lot of you uh care
39:57 - can't commit the time or the the take
40:01 - the time away from putting food on the
40:02 - table what would it what would it take
40:04 - for you to be able to focus and it was
40:06 - $200 a week was the was the average we
40:09 - can make that happen we can figure out a
40:11 - way to get folks those fund so that they
40:14 - can focus and get through a program like
40:16 - a 100 devs and yeah so now we're a
40:18 - global Community our Discord is 60,000
40:21 - plus strong uh we have alumni all around
40:24 - the world and we're just trying to
40:25 - figure out a way uh for folks to be able
40:28 - to unlock a stable high growth career
40:33 - put food on the table support themselves
40:35 - and their family and their loved ones
40:36 - and luckily we found a lot of folks that
40:39 - believe in that idea and Mission to and
40:41 - we build a wonderful Community around it
40:42 - yeah and uh so the mechanics of the
40:46 - community like first of all it goes
40:48 - without saying that I'm in awe of what
40:50 - you all are accomplishing with hund devs
40:53 - and uh I've had so many positive
40:54 - interactions with people who are both
40:57 - like the free Cod Camp curriculum and in
40:59 - the 100 devs I guess you call it like a
41:02 - cohort or an intake or like basically a
41:04 - bunch of people working together through
41:06 - a set kind of like week to week um
41:09 - program and I you know free Cod camp we
41:12 - have experimented with like cohorted
41:14 - programs and like let's see if we can
41:15 - get all these people uh but what we
41:17 - found is like it's it's a lot of work to
41:19 - organize which I'm sure you're very
41:21 - aware of and like free COC philosophy is
41:23 - like let's just build the resources at
41:25 - scale put them out there
41:28 - yes lots of kids who are the you know
41:31 - the son or daughter of like software
41:33 - engineers in poo Alto are going to use
41:35 - free Cod camp and they're going to use
41:36 - it for free and they you know probably
41:38 - could have paid a bunch of money to have
41:40 - a computer science student like tutor
41:41 - them or something right but also a whole
41:44 - lot of kids who are in like a village in
41:46 - rural India or uh in like kind of like a
41:49 - failed State uh which a lot of people
41:53 - have smartphones and can't get on the
41:55 - internet even in places like Somalia
41:57 - right
41:58 - uh North Korea right people in North
42:00 - Korea use freeo Camp sometimes that's
42:02 - wild and uh essentially they can they
42:05 - can learn even though uh it would be
42:09 - normally prohibitively expensive for
42:11 - them to buy you know a $20 course on
42:15 - like a course website uh for example and
42:18 - and so like our philosophy is like we
42:19 - need to make sure that there is a
42:22 - baseline that everybody has access to
42:24 - comprehensive math programming computer
42:26 - science and English
42:27 - education um so that everybody
42:29 - regardless of their circumstances if
42:31 - they have time which not everybody does
42:34 - but if they have time or they can figure
42:35 - out techniques to like make time yeah to
42:38 - learn even a little each day then they
42:40 - can make steady forward progress toward
42:42 - the eventual goal of working as a
42:44 - software engineer right uh so so that is
42:47 - kind of like our philosophy is like
42:49 - let's just make tons of really high
42:51 - quality free stuff that's essentially
42:54 - subsidized by the community like the the
42:56 - people who are able to give the alumni
42:59 - um sometimes like we got a gift for
43:02 - $250,000 the other day from comp saw CEO
43:05 - of coma is a fan of free Cod camp and
43:07 - uses free Cod Camp to expand his
43:09 - JavaScript knowledge super chill dude uh
43:11 - you know we darl silver uh founder of
43:15 - thinkful uh kicked in
43:18 - $150,000 um and then of course we're
43:20 - getting grants from like you know Linux
43:21 - foundation and mongodb and Google and a
43:24 - lot of other organizations but a vast
43:26 - majority of our support comes directly
43:27 - from the community from people who
43:29 - donate so rec.org donate all right but
43:32 - but my point is oh yeah and thank you
43:35 - thank you for supporting our charity uh
43:37 - Le I didn't even realize I apologize um
43:39 - but maybe you're getting my my periodic
43:41 - donor uh email like I said yeah so
43:46 - um my point in all all this little
43:48 - tangent is to say that like free C Camp
43:51 - like we don't have the bandwidth to do
43:53 - things that don't
43:54 - scale and you are doing things that
43:57 - don't scale at all really like maybe you
43:59 - figured out some techniques to get like
44:01 - cohorts to scale and get like because I
44:02 - mean you mentioned your Discord has
44:04 - 60,000 people in it uh but like actually
44:09 - getting on stream and like teaching for
44:11 - like a marathon 3 five hours like
44:14 - however long you go it's really
44:15 - inspiring uh definitely catch some of
44:17 - the live streams if you can or I've
44:19 - watched I I watch everything at Double
44:20 - speed so I watch like the video on
44:22 - demand Stu like that but uh like I guess
44:27 - you saw from coming from the like
44:29 - intensive program where you're teaching
44:31 - folks like you saw the Merit of quality
44:34 - not just quantity or like I guess like
44:36 - cont like I'm not like doing things that
44:38 - don't scale really uh and and helping in
44:42 - people individually uh doesn't really
44:44 - scale but that's not necessarily the
44:46 - idea the idea is to give a whole lot of
44:48 - attention to a a smaller number of
44:51 - people and to really make sure that
44:53 - those people can ramp up to you know an
44:55 - impressive he said like uh what was the
44:58 - uh the figure you said was like the the
45:00 - median income of people who graduated um
45:04 - 92,000 yeah for cters yeah that's a lot
45:07 - more than I made at my first developer
45:09 - job given if this is in Boston like the
45:11 - cost of living might be higher but but I
45:13 - mean that's a that's a lot of freaking
45:14 - money for people that like I I imagine
45:18 - some of these people don't have
45:19 - University degrees I didn't even know
45:20 - that you hadn't completed your degree
45:22 - although dropping out of Yale is
45:24 - probably very different from dropping
45:25 - out of like you know rather University
45:28 - right yeah but uh sorry I've been
45:31 - talking for the last three minutes I'm
45:32 - just very excited about how you approach
45:35 - this and I I want to make sure our
45:37 - audience appreciates the I guess
45:40 - counterintuitiveness of what you've done
45:43 - uh and how you've been able like people
45:46 - weren't doing this because it was
45:47 - perhaps counterintuitive to do so and it
45:49 - was like probably very idea don't
45:53 - yeah so so like maybe you can talk about
45:56 - that like how you have to do stuff that
45:58 - doesn't scale and like ways that it
45:59 - doesn't scale and then ways like
46:00 - techniques you figured out to scale it a
46:02 - little bit sure yeah happy to I think
46:05 - the first thing though is just like
46:06 - Shout Out free code camp like you all
46:08 - laid the the foundation for so many
46:10 - folks to learn and one of the things I'm
46:13 - always hyping uh especially in 100 devs
46:16 - on our Discord is I think a lot of folks
46:19 - that go into this
46:20 - space don't put in the work to do the
46:23 - things that really matter the most and
46:26 - so one of the things I've always admired
46:27 - about free code Camp is like this
46:29 - commitment to filling the gaps and so
46:31 - realizing that most people don't have
46:34 - the privilege of speaking English so
46:35 - we're going to build a full like how do
46:37 - you speak English course right uh that's
46:40 - that's huge it's like very progressively
46:42 - thinking about what do our folks going
46:46 - through our program absolutely need and
46:49 - so um that's why I'm so happy that free
46:51 - code Camp exists it's why it's one of
46:53 - the first things I always recommend to
46:55 - new folks getting into Tech and why like
46:58 - I I think you all will continue to be so
47:00 - successful cuz it's just like this
47:01 - Relentless pursuit of making Tech more
47:04 - Equitable to everyone and so um that's
47:06 - why I said really early on in this
47:07 - conversation I look up to you so much
47:09 - and it's a lot of that ethos is what
47:11 - I've tried to bring to 100 devs um for
47:14 - 400 devs we got started during the
47:18 - pandemic and the pandemic hit and things
47:21 - got really bad really quickly so people
47:25 - always like to talk in Boston about at
47:27 - 2% unemployment rate but I knew just
47:29 - from looking at the actual data when you
47:32 - looked in our communities of color is
47:34 - already at 12% this is pre pandemic if
47:37 - you look during the pandemic it jumped
47:38 - from 12 to like 33% in some communities
47:42 - and so it got real bad real quick and I
47:45 - I just if you are already in Tech or if
47:48 - you already come from a privilege
47:49 - background I don't think people really
47:51 - understand what that means when right
47:53 - now like if you look at the most recent
47:54 - like labor data like the the median
47:56 - income come median median is 56,000 in
48:00 - the US and so if we have that percent of
48:03 - folks under it and we're seeing 33%
48:06 - unemployment and then labor data
48:07 - actually includes like eligible workers
48:10 - it just got real bad real quick and it
48:12 - continues to be a really rough situation
48:14 - from folks and so I'm not a doctor uh I
48:18 - didn't have like a skill that I thought
48:20 - that could be helpful to folks that were
48:22 - being affected by the pandemic but I had
48:24 - been teaching for a while and I knew
48:26 - that I could get folks uh skills to make
48:29 - them more employable and so 100 devs
48:32 - started as a way of getting 100 folks
48:35 - into software engineering jobs we're way
48:37 - beyond that now and I wanted to make a
48:41 - live cohort where we would meet twice a
48:44 - week on the internet and I really
48:47 - thought it would be like you said just a
48:48 - handful of folks maybe five 10 people um
48:51 - we did a pilot that was really
48:52 - successful our first cohort was about
48:55 - 300 people every single class that was
48:58 - successful we did another cohort that
49:00 - was like 3,000 people every single live
49:03 - every single class and so we kind of
49:04 - just built slowly we we we were able to
49:07 - kind of jump from Zer to 300 300 to
49:10 - 3,000 and we always joke that we're
49:13 - baddies we're like we're we're baddies
49:15 - writing bad code like it doesn't matter
49:17 - uh it's about getting the skills that we
49:19 - need it's about figuring out things on
49:20 - the Fly um and we just live up to being
49:23 - kind always to ourselves to others and
49:26 - as long as you're willing to say you
49:27 - know what we got to figure this out we
49:29 - got to figure out how do we do this at
49:31 - scale how do we have 3,000 people live
49:33 - in a class getting help and not feeling
49:35 - lost um we had to figure systems and
49:39 - ways of doing that and um building
49:41 - community that wanted to support that
49:43 - number of folks awesome what you said
49:46 - there first like I just want to call it
49:47 - that that particular Insight we're
49:48 - baddies writing bad code it doesn't
49:50 - matter so when I was a you know a
49:53 - teenager like uh really interested in
49:56 - like writing and reading lots of you
49:58 - know fiction and Jour like literary
50:01 - journalism and stuff like that um I I
50:05 - would always hang out at Denny's like
50:06 - till 2: amm just talking to random
50:07 - people and learning from them and just
50:09 - writing and stuff and uh one time like
50:12 - our our server he he was kind of a
50:14 - grizzled old looking dude like he would
50:16 - he would not look at a place in like a
50:18 - bullpen in a newspaper Newsroom if such
50:21 - thing even exist in
50:22 - 2024 but uh but his advice to me was
50:26 - I'll never never forget what he said he
50:28 - he said throw away your first million
50:33 - words and I was love that damn a million
50:36 - words that's like years of writing uh
50:39 - but just accept that it's gonna suck and
50:42 - the same thing with your your code
50:43 - projects and really the same with any
50:45 - Endeavor you you take like I've been
50:48 - trying to get better at Bass for the
50:49 - past three or four years and like takes
50:51 - me forever to record the bass intros for
50:54 - like I thought you like the one of the
50:57 - videos I watched you did it and then sat
50:59 - down so that's what I was I'm telling
51:00 - you that's what I was expecting for for
51:02 - today so I'm a little sad that I didn't
51:04 - get the bass intro live just for me but
51:07 - I didn't want to bother you with like
51:09 - watching me screwed up several times I
51:12 - love it but but yeah like like you just
51:14 - have to accept that the first few
51:16 - thousand hours you spend with an
51:17 - instrument or with like a programming
51:19 - language or with anything is going to be
51:21 - not ready for prime time uh you know my
51:24 - wife uh she grew up in China we met in
51:26 - grad school and she's now a US citizen
51:29 - we we brought her over and naturalized
51:31 - her after grad school after we got
51:33 - married we've been married 19 years and
51:36 - um she she loved playing piano right and
51:39 - one of the things that she says in China
51:41 - like people take piano extremely
51:43 - seriously and they have the saying in
51:45 - Chinese which is basically like you
51:47 - spend thousands of hours um behind the
51:50 - stage practicing for you know five
51:52 - minutes on the stage you know like
51:54 - that's just the nature of the game
51:57 - and with code like if you're writing
51:59 - some serious system that's going to like
52:01 - code that's going to be run millions of
52:03 - times right like if you're making an
52:05 - open source contribution to free Cod
52:07 - camps codebase and it's in the platform
52:09 - itself and this component is going to be
52:11 - rendered 50,000 times a day or something
52:14 - like that like it's it's okay that it
52:17 - took you a whole lot of work to get that
52:19 - like code into the shape and it's okay
52:20 - that it took a lot of practice and trial
52:22 - and error before you got the skills to
52:24 - be able to create that code that code
52:26 - just going to keep going right like you
52:28 - know uh when Elvis goes up on the stage
52:30 - and he's being filmed uh and he's
52:33 - playing I use Elvis because I love Elvis
52:36 - I'm
52:37 - sure he's overrated or whatever but he
52:39 - he's he's the man so I mean like that
52:43 - guy practiced like crazy that's
52:45 - definitely the same with uh for example
52:48 - like James Jamerson the greatest basist
52:50 - of all time basically uh or um you know
52:54 - like pretty much any musician they're
52:55 - going to practice just like crazy
52:57 - they're going to rehearse obsessively
52:59 - and they're not going to be satisfied
53:01 - but once that recording is made once
53:02 - that record is cut if you if you uh
53:05 - there's this great um documentary about
53:08 - fonus monk uh the jazz pianist right and
53:11 - he would only do like two
53:13 - takes and he he's just like after two
53:16 - takes whatever I do is going to be
53:17 - garbage I'm done like use one of those
53:20 - takes but how it got how he got so good
53:22 - that he could actually nail it in one or
53:25 - two takes was he practiced like a maniac
53:28 - and he spent so much time at the piano
53:30 - uh where a lot of you know uh I guess
53:33 - amateurs would would just be like good
53:35 - enough he was not content with that and
53:38 - so I feel the same way about like any
53:40 - undertaking but but like certainly with
53:43 - coding it may seem like coding is not
53:45 - like a synchronous performative event
53:47 - like where you're having to sit down and
53:49 - perform in that regard you can go and
53:50 - you can edit your code you can iterate
53:52 - on it the tools have gotten so much
53:53 - better like free C Camp every
53:55 - millisecond or two you're going to get
53:56 - the tests like telling you whether you
53:59 - met all the test conditions or whether
54:00 - you need to keep tweaking your code
54:02 - right so you have all these tools to
54:03 - iterate but at the end of the day like
54:06 - you should still try to approach it like
54:07 - a performance you'll get a lot better if
54:09 - you don't rely so much on the tools
54:10 - catching uh what you're doing but anyway
54:12 - I'm kind of going on a tangent but I
54:14 - just wanted to to Riff on like the
54:17 - Insight that it is we're all baddies
54:19 - yeah we're writing bad Cod it doesn't
54:21 - matter because you throw away your first
54:22 - million words you spend thousands of
54:25 - hours at the piano before you're playing
54:26 - anything that's worth anybody listening
54:28 - to right like you just have to accept
54:30 - that this is the nature of reality this
54:32 - is the nature of doing anything that's
54:33 - hard is it's going to be hard you're
54:36 - going to have to work hard and you have
54:38 - to just have that mental fortitude and
54:40 - and that's something that comes through
54:41 - in your your video is like it's so
54:43 - supportive like I love the way that
54:45 - you're just like it's all good like just
54:48 - this happens to everybody everybody has
54:49 - to go through this you know I always
54:52 - like to say like there some people may
54:54 - be like slightly better at programming
54:56 - like aptitude wise or or like they may
54:58 - have some intrinsic like Quirk that
55:00 - makes them marginally better at
55:01 - programming but those people were
55:04 - probably just forgotten how much time
55:05 - they spent at the keyboard when they
55:06 - were a kid if they were privileged
55:07 - enough to grow up with computers right
55:10 - like uh you know when you hear like Bill
55:12 - Gates talk about how like oh I don't
55:14 - actually like write out the code until I
55:15 - figured everything out in my head and
55:16 - then I said that's nonsense Bill Gates
55:19 - did not just sit down and like write
55:21 - basic from memory because he'd like been
55:23 - moving everything around his head people
55:25 - can't do that I don't believe that that
55:26 - maybe there are some people that have
55:27 - like some extreme form of like like like
55:31 - extreme brains they could do something
55:32 - like that but I don't believe that Bill
55:34 - Gates could do that sort of stuff I
55:35 - think he's just talking up the Mythos
55:37 - you know he he's trying to build up hype
55:38 - for himself and like it's this old kind
55:41 - of like Old School elitism uh that a lot
55:44 - of the early devs the Old Guard have and
55:46 - uh just just don't buy that hype is is
55:48 - all I want to say and and I want to
55:49 - thank you for like dispelling a lot of
55:51 - that whether you're intentionally
55:52 - dispelling it or not just telling people
55:55 - like coding is
55:56 - right like not not sugar coating it we
55:59 - call it the trough of Sorrow which
56:01 - actually comes from like startup worlds
56:03 - is one of the things there's this very
56:04 - classic graph of like um this like
56:07 - really big hill that you go up when
56:09 - you're really excited about something
56:11 - like I'm going to learn the code you buy
56:13 - a thousand Demi courses because buying
56:14 - stuff feels good even though you're not
56:15 - going to do them and you at the very top
56:17 - and then you start like day one of any
56:21 - actual coding program and then you just
56:22 - Plum it once you realize how long it's
56:24 - going to take and then you spend all
56:26 - that time going through the trough of
56:29 - sorrow and then the most like sick thing
56:32 - about this is that I shouldn't say that
56:34 - but the the most Twisted thing about
56:36 - this is at the very end there's an even
56:37 - further dip that you have to go through
56:39 - uh where you it's the and then you get
56:41 - into what we call the Wiggles of false
56:42 - hope so even after you've gone through
56:44 - you've learned everything you needed to
56:45 - learn you start actually interviewing to
56:46 - get the job and you're just getting
56:48 - rejected rejected rejected and so
56:50 - there's just this huge curve long trough
56:53 - of Sorrow uh that for a lot of folks
56:55 - takes years to get through then once you
56:57 - get to the end where you're like trying
56:59 - to actually get something out of it it
57:00 - gets even worse and then slowly slowly
57:03 - gets better so I think the big thing for
57:06 - what we do like you mentioned at 100
57:08 - devs is just helping folks manage that
57:10 - frustration we kind of have like three
57:12 - key things that we just say every class
57:14 - almost manage your frustration be
57:16 - consistent and take care of yourself
57:18 - when you look at how adults learn the
57:21 - reason why adults kind of probably don't
57:25 - learn is as well as they think they
57:27 - could is because they don't manage that
57:29 - frustration piece when they looked at
57:31 - language fluency and like language
57:33 - acquisition they thought that we
57:35 - probably lost the ability to be fluent
57:37 - in our teenage years but they found that
57:39 - that probably isn't true it's just once
57:40 - you get out of those years your time is
57:42 - entirely your own and so would you
57:44 - rather do this thing that sucks for two
57:46 - years or would you actually uh sit down
57:49 - and do it and so if folks that can
57:51 - manage that frustration to actually be
57:53 - get through the things they want to do
57:55 - and so that's a big part and it's also
57:57 - why we're live uh when you look at other
58:01 - programs I love uh Dr M out of Harvard
58:05 - cs50 I love that cs50 is now on on free
58:08 - cam I've read every single article
58:10 - they've ever put out and one of the ones
58:13 - that are really interesting is they
58:14 - actually published all of their data for
58:15 - cs50 in the beginning uh which was
58:18 - really cool to read through and you you
58:21 - notice that they had like 150,000 people
58:25 - that signed up for like the
58:42 - [Music]
59:16 - [Music]
59:26 - they're up and they'll help you get back
59:27 - up right so you help one another so that
59:30 - that's kind of the genius of 100 Dev so
59:32 - maybe you can talk a little about the
59:33 - mechanics of it obviously you've got the
59:35 - Discord you've got the twice weekly um
59:38 - streams when classes in session so to
59:40 - speak uh and and they are high energy
59:44 - streams man I just have to compliment
59:45 - like the you got like the like all these
59:48 - sound effects like the cool astronaut
59:49 - background and stuff it's like watching
59:51 - uh like a gamer on Twitch like like
59:54 - watching somebody playing like you know
59:56 - csgo at a high level or something but it
59:58 - it's education right like and in my mind
60:01 - like you're pioneering kind of a new
60:03 - approach to education that is based off
60:06 - of like people are already familiar with
60:08 - like games and Anime and all these other
60:10 - cultural kind of touchstones and you're
60:12 - just like hey let's let's relate this to
60:14 - software engineering right and so you're
60:17 - doing a great job of that but maybe you
60:19 - can talk about in addition to the stream
60:21 - in addition to the Discord what are the
60:22 - other aspects of 100 devs what are the
60:24 - other uh instruments sure so we do a
60:28 - live cohort model we basically do a
60:30 - cohort a year and when that cohort is
60:34 - live we're live on Twitch twice a week
60:37 - uh for about three hours for a class we
60:40 - take about an hour to do review space
60:42 - repetition active recall is super
60:45 - important uh so we spend that first hour
60:47 - just like reviewing and then about two
60:49 - hours of something new we do that twice
60:50 - a week and then we have office hours on
60:52 - Sunday which is another stream typically
60:55 - on Twitch or on Discord um but it's just
60:58 - people asking questions and getting
61:00 - things answered outside of that there
61:03 - are so many other expectations and
61:05 - things that you're working on that's
61:07 - about 10 to 20 hours outside of that
61:09 - twice a week class networking all the
61:12 - things are going to actually move the
61:13 - needle for you to get a job our our our
61:15 - joke is that we're not really a coding
61:16 - program we're getting a job program and
61:18 - so all the things you have to be doing
61:19 - to get a job have to be happening when
61:21 - we're not live then for folks that can't
61:25 - participate in a live experience we have
61:27 - our lustrious catchup crew which is a
61:29 - group of folks that are working through
61:31 - the classes at maybe a little bit more
61:33 - of their own pace we have a lot of folks
61:34 - that are around the world that can't
61:36 - make that live time work for them so
61:38 - they get together they're on our Discord
61:40 - working through the classes together
61:42 - you'll often see like 20 people just in
61:44 - a voice Channel watching a class
61:46 - together um that they've just they've
61:49 - come together to do uh and so you can
61:51 - move through the material at your own
61:52 - pace uh when we're outside of a cohort
61:55 - like right now now we have we have our
61:57 - huddles twice a week and the huddles are
62:00 - just like a traditional standup we're
62:01 - just trying to move away from that I I
62:03 - think it's a slightly ableist term so we
62:05 - interest them as as huddles and yeah
62:07 - that makes sense I've never thought
62:08 - about stand up as an ableist term but it
62:10 - is a lot of people can't stand up and so
62:14 - we we'll have anywhere from like 500 to
62:16 - 700 people every huddle just asking
62:19 - questions sharing we call the the job
62:22 - hunt the hunt sharing what's happening
62:24 - on the hunt uh how while they are
62:27 - negotiating they'll come up live we'll
62:29 - help them negotiate offers they'll talk
62:31 - about uh an interview that W great or
62:34 - poorly and just by showing up to these
62:37 - huddles you're learning all these like
62:39 - it's so hard to go through life with
62:42 - everything that you're experiencing
62:44 - being the first time you've experienced
62:45 - it it doesn't have to be that way
62:47 - specifically with when you have a
62:49 - community that's also doing it so the
62:51 - huddles are our way to expose people to
62:53 - the realities of getting a job going and
62:56 - interviewing and and and actually seeing
62:58 - all this knowledge and so that when
62:59 - you're in that situation uh you can
63:01 - experience it too so we have the huddles
63:04 - twice a week and then we have a lot of
63:06 - independently generated Community things
63:08 - so um we have Banky brunch shout out
63:11 - Banky brunch which is a group of folks
63:13 - that come together to work through
63:14 - behavioral questions technical questions
63:16 - pretty much every single day uh we have
63:18 - groups that are working on projects our
63:20 - voice channels are always going and uh
63:22 - none of this works without community and
63:25 - a wonderful group of mods uh i' be
63:28 - remiss to not say Miriam dier Mayan wolf
63:31 - Claire uh these folks that like blah
63:34 - that make like all this work um and for
63:38 - free and volunteering so much of their
63:40 - life to like make this happen amazing
63:43 - yeah like free Co Camp similarly to draw
63:46 - parallels to our organization very
63:49 - Community Driven like we have tons of
63:51 - mods on the Forum on Discord we have
63:54 - open source contributors that are just
63:56 - dropping in and like fixing little bugs
63:58 - making sure that like our copy is as
64:00 - readable as possible to non-native
64:02 - English speakers making sure that like
64:04 - you it's a lot of contributor driven
64:07 - activity and it sounds like you've
64:08 - figured out a way to encourage a lot of
64:11 - people in your community Empower them
64:12 - with like you know you can delegate uh
64:15 - some degree of uh I guess authority to
64:19 - them so that they can go out and they
64:20 - can just experiment and build out
64:23 - different things one of the things that
64:25 - you said uh that I thought was really
64:27 - interesting uh I do want to talk about
64:29 - let's just talk about space repetition
64:31 - and active recall I believe are the
64:33 - terms sure uh Barbara Oakley teaches the
64:36 - how to learn course the most popular moo
64:39 - massive open online course ever other
64:41 - than maybe like cs50 which we were
64:43 - talking about earlier uh learning how to
64:45 - learn it's not just obvious how to learn
64:48 - there tactics right there there are
64:51 - phenomena uh in that are ingrained in
64:53 - the human brain from you know Evol tion
64:56 - from like the you know savanas of Africa
64:59 - basically that we carry with us today uh
65:02 - that that we can use if we know how to
65:05 - use them and one of them you mentioned
65:06 - is space repetition what what is space
65:09 - repetition yeah sure so I I guess kind
65:12 - of to set the stage real quick is that a
65:14 - lot of folks that attempt to learn how
65:15 - to code are not successful we know that
65:18 - we know the drop offs we know that
65:19 - that's just a reality and a lot of time
65:22 - those people feel like that it is them
65:24 - that it's a they they do not have the
65:26 - ability to learn how to codee they do
65:28 - not have there's something about them
65:29 - that would stop them from being
65:30 - successful as a software engineer and as
65:33 - someone that's worked with thousands of
65:34 - people like literally in the classroom
65:37 - my finger is on their keyboard I just
65:39 - know fundamentally my heart of hearts
65:40 - like a outside of a a cognitive
65:45 - impairment that's just not true and the
65:47 - thing that I found is it's just that
65:51 - most people don't know how to learn and
65:55 - it's it's almost criminal that our
65:56 - school system doesn't actually teach us
65:59 - how to learn that every textbook doesn't
66:01 - have some very fundamental things at the
66:03 - beginning uh that help you remember and
66:06 - learn this material so the difficult
66:09 - thing about software engineering is that
66:10 - it's a cumulative career the things you
66:12 - learn this week you're might need two
66:14 - years from now and so there are two like
66:17 - really
66:18 - fundamental learning techniques that Dr
66:21 - Barbara Oakley does walk through that I
66:23 - really it's my favorite one of my
66:24 - favorite courses of all time uh brings
66:26 - up uh where as
66:29 - humans we forget stuff very quickly so
66:34 - if I gave you a three-letter code this
66:37 - is called the evos curve it's it was a
66:39 - study of one it's somewhat been
66:40 - replicated since then but basically this
66:42 - person just tracked a new three-letter
66:44 - word a three-letter code every day and
66:47 - they found within the first like 30
66:50 - minutes there was a 20% chance they just
66:52 - forgotten it the first 30 minutes so
66:54 - imagine trying to learn this really
66:55 - complicated coding stuff and within the
66:58 - first 3 minutes you're going to forget
66:59 - it then if you look at that forgetting
67:01 - curve by the end of the month there's an
67:03 - 80% chance that you have forgotten that
67:06 - very simple thing and so for a lot of
67:09 - folks that are going into coding
67:10 - education they just don't realize that
67:11 - the forgetting curve is very steep they
67:14 - they'll learn something a month later
67:16 - they've completely forgotten and they
67:17 - start back over and that's super
67:19 - frustrating so space repetition is using
67:22 - a tool that makes the material come back
67:25 - to you when you need it most and so uh a
67:29 - typical tool for this is anky or Anki
67:31 - however you want to call it that's like
67:33 - it means to commit to memory in Japanese
67:36 - aod exactly and so it is a flashcard
67:40 - tool that has an algorithm behind it so
67:43 - that surfaces the information when you
67:45 - need to see it so if you're doing good
67:46 - study habits which is a huge portion of
67:48 - what we teach at 100 devs it's just like
67:50 - how to study you're using this tool so
67:52 - that the things you learned about HTML
67:54 - you're not forgetting when we're talking
67:56 - about like mongod DP right and so that
67:58 - space repetition is going to help you
68:00 - remember stuff for the long call which
68:02 - is really important for a cumulative
68:03 - career but then the other thing that's
68:05 - even more important in my opinion than
68:07 - space repetition is something called
68:09 - active
68:10 - recall coding can be done through like
68:13 - video tutorials it can be done through
68:15 - text but it's a lot of information the
68:18 - process and most people just go through
68:22 - it that's not active learning they they
68:25 - feel maybe some sort of productivity
68:28 - from having watched tutorial or having
68:30 - read a blog post but they didn't
68:32 - actually engage with that material or
68:34 - learn and a lot of times like for me I
68:37 - teleport through information like if I'm
68:38 - reading a book I'll get through three
68:40 - paragraphs and I'm like what the heck
68:42 - just happened I feel like I've just
68:43 - teleported through that T through I
68:45 - haven't heard that expression but that's
68:46 - a good way to describe the phenomenon
68:48 - especially you know people who have like
68:50 - ADHD and stuff they may just be like
68:52 - halfway through a you know a book maybe
68:54 - I don't know like
68:56 - you just your mind wanders and uh if
68:59 - you're not constantly kind of trying to
69:01 - engage with it you won't necessarily
69:03 - retain so active recall is the way that
69:05 - that helps me as someone that does have
69:07 - ADHD like do this and so active recall
69:10 - is just recalling the things that you
69:11 - just learned or just read or just
69:13 - watched and for folks that do have
69:15 - attention issues I recommend doing that
69:17 - after each paragraph uh I recommend
69:20 - doing after each chapter end and you're
69:23 - just literally talking to yourself what
69:25 - did I I just read what did I just learn
69:27 - and you're saying it out loud the
69:28 - research behind it is really shocking
69:30 - like staggering differences uh you can
69:33 - learn something once actively recall it
69:36 - once and do better than somebody that
69:38 - reread it four times yeah like you can
69:41 - do a quarter of the effort and have
69:43 - better results just with this one
69:45 - technique and the fact that that's not
69:46 - like stamped in every single textbook
69:48 - ever made is is absurd yeah it it's I
69:52 - mean like we could talk all day about
69:53 - like the shortcomings of the US uh uh
69:56 - education syst like both both uh K
69:58 - through2 and HED and be completely clear
70:01 - there are a lot of very smart people who
70:03 - are working very hard to address a lot
70:04 - of these deficiencies but but the fact
70:06 - that we're having to explain what active
70:08 - recall and uh you know space repetition
70:11 - are when they are you know like time-
70:13 - tested phenomena that you can leverage
70:16 - so just a quick note about active recall
70:18 - this is one of the reasons why freeo
70:19 - Camp's entire curriculum is interactive
70:22 - it's because you have to Grapple with
70:24 - things otherwise it's just it could have
70:26 - just blown right past you right like y
70:28 - everything needs some sort of evaluation
70:30 - criteria some sort of comprehension
70:31 - check and if you're doing something that
70:33 - doesn't have comprehension check if
70:35 - there's not some right or wrong answer
70:37 - taking a moment to summarize what you
70:38 - just learned or relate it to something
70:40 - else you've learned think thinking about
70:41 - it just grappling with it that that can
70:43 - absolutely help cement those you know
70:47 - synapses right like what's the thing
70:49 - that connects synapse Axion not Axion
70:53 - dendrites I can't remember it is you
70:56 - probably know but uh but yeah like and
71:00 - it's something anybody can do like when
71:01 - I when I'm uh you know reading a news
71:04 - article or something like that right
71:05 - that's not interactive now with GPT or
71:06 - something I could throw I could throw it
71:08 - in GPT and say like hey come up with
71:09 - like a multiple choice question based
71:10 - off this article and I'll do that
71:12 - sometimes uh and not not just for like
71:15 - active recall but space repetition like
71:17 - write a bunch of notes and then review
71:19 - them a few days later or use a tool like
71:21 - eny that can systematically do that
71:23 - where you can like load a bunch of flash
71:25 - cards s a lot of learning platforms have
71:27 - spaced repetition just built into them
71:29 - if you go through the free Cod Camp
71:30 - curriculum it's designed in such a way
71:32 - that we're going to reintroduce Concepts
71:34 - over and over and you're going to be
71:35 - like oh yeah I kind of remember this
71:37 - from like a few hours ago you know it's
71:39 - like or a few days ago like but but
71:42 - we're intentionally trying to you know
71:44 - incorporate that and one of the things I
71:46 - think talking about the free codame
71:47 - curriculum let's talk about 100 devs and
71:50 - like what you all are and is it 100 devs
71:52 - or 100
71:54 - devs I you say either 100 Dev I just I
71:57 - couldn't remember I say 100 devs 100
71:59 - devs is shorter yeah it sounds more uh
72:01 - more like easy to say so yeah with 100
72:04 - devs like what is the coursework that
72:06 - you're going through like are are you
72:07 - using mukes are you using open textbooks
72:10 - are you creating a lot of the stuff
72:11 - yourself how are you do yeah so I think
72:13 - there's like two important things one I
72:16 - really don't believe the content matters
72:18 - it's all the other like we're we're jobs
72:20 - program and I think I think one the
72:23 - biggest mistakes people make is like an
72:25 - over an investment and the idea that the
72:29 - thing like that the learning aspect and
72:31 - not all the other things that move the
72:32 - needle so we're very much two kind of
72:35 - tracks like we have all this other stuff
72:37 - we're doing outside of the learning and
72:38 - then the learning as well so the
72:40 - learning is is very simple um we do full
72:43 - stack JavaScript and I do a lot of like
72:46 - custom like I make all the lectures
72:48 - basically with the slides and all the
72:50 - the funny stuff that you mentioned on
72:51 - Twitch and we we move through that
72:53 - material together but a lot of a lot of
72:55 - it is supplementing with other things
72:57 - that I think are just the best free
72:58 - courses out there so in the beginning
73:00 - our students will use some free code cab
73:03 - um as they get a little bit further
73:04 - along they'll they'll use um some things
73:07 - maybe from Full stack open um that are
73:09 - trying to supplement the things that
73:10 - we're doing in the classroom and anytime
73:13 - that's we're doing something it's always
73:15 - a free resource it always has a free
73:17 - trial or not a trial like a free level
73:19 - of access yeah um and so we we give you
73:22 - the skills to be a full stack web devel
73:25 - developer we do some of the other kind
73:27 - of rounding out to give you the software
73:29 - engineering skill set um the tooling and
73:32 - things that you might use and then uh as
73:34 - you're getting ready to go on the hunt
73:35 - the data structures and algorithms
73:36 - you're going to need to be successful um
73:38 - but that's kind of like the coding stuff
73:41 - outside of that from the very beginning
73:43 - there's pretty stringent requirements in
73:45 - terms of like your networking so you are
73:48 - supposed to be getting three connections
73:50 - and two coffee chats every single week
73:52 - uh throughout program you're doing
73:54 - things that are going to be opening all
73:56 - these doors to help you get a job and um
74:00 - that's kind of another really I think
74:02 - that's where our curriculum shines is
74:04 - those things that are really helpful and
74:06 - impactful for helping you get a job we
74:08 - actually have a lot of folks that do
74:09 - other boot camps which we love like like
74:11 - I don't really care where you come from
74:13 - what you do as long as like you're
74:14 - getting to where you want to go and a
74:17 - lot of folks will join us just for like
74:18 - the how to get a job portion which I
74:20 - think we're pretty strong at awesome so
74:23 - it it's so interesting and important
74:26 - that you distinguish yourself as like a
74:28 - not a learn coding program but a Get a
74:31 - Job Program uh and I just want to
74:33 - emphasize like like even though we put a
74:35 - great deal of time and energy into our
74:37 - curriculum it's AB absolutely like if
74:38 - you took it like look at where all the
74:40 - donations we get and things like that go
74:42 - toward its instructional design platform
74:44 - development mainly for the Core
74:47 - Curriculum uh because for us it is
74:49 - important that there's a really good
74:51 - Core Curriculum but I'll be the first to
74:54 - tell you or I guess the second since
74:55 - Leon just said
74:57 - it getting a job as a developer is
74:59 - really three things in my humble opinion
75:02 - and and if you haven't read my free book
75:04 - that uh I published about a year ago uh
75:08 - learn to code and get a developer job
75:09 - literally the name of the book just
75:10 - Google that or go Google code book and I
75:13 - or learn to code book I think you you
75:15 - should find it pretty quickly um and by
75:18 - finding it and clicking on it and
75:19 - spending a lot of time on the page you
75:20 - help ensure that Google continues to
75:22 - recommend it to people um so uh
75:26 - skills are only one leg of the stool y
75:29 - network and reputation are the other two
75:32 - and I we've talked enough about skills
75:35 - let's jump into networking and building
75:37 - your reputation which are two things
75:39 - that are also instrumental to the
75:41 - hundred devs program yeah yeah like like
75:45 - what is the value of a network why is
75:48 - networking worth your time and energy
75:50 - when it's such an awkward you know thing
75:52 - to
75:53 - do yeah we we have
75:57 - um it's so we have like a lot of like in
75:59 - jokes and things like that that if like
76:01 - you're not part of the community it's
76:02 - kind of like weird to bring up but we
76:04 - refer to most people as
76:06 - clickers uh people that learn how to
76:09 - code and then they just click apply uh
76:12 - and clickers don't get jobs maybe every
76:14 - once in a while somebody gets lucky and
76:16 - they click on a button and they
76:17 - magically get a job but especially in
76:19 - this market clickers don't get jobs and
76:22 - so we do everything in our power to
76:25 - never click apply we want to make sure
76:27 - that we're talking to like real humans
76:29 - that can see our Humanity that can see
76:32 - our ability and our skills and the
76:34 - things that we can do um so that we're
76:37 - not just discarded by some AI ATS system
76:42 - and so from the very beginning of 100
76:44 - devs we're tasking you with generalized
76:47 - networking and networking I think it's
76:49 - like a scary term that I don't think
76:51 - should be to me networking is just
76:52 - making friends and you want to do things
76:56 - in the beginning that get you
76:57 - comfortable with making friends and so
77:00 - you don't have to start networking by
77:02 - going to like your local python Meetup
77:04 - that's like super hardcore like no if
77:06 - you like Pokemon go play Pokemon at your
77:09 - your local league right or like if you
77:11 - like hiking go on a join like a hiking
77:14 - group and just like share passion with
77:17 - some others get comfortable talking to
77:19 - people and then eventually apply those
77:21 - skills that you learn to places where
77:23 - developers are more likely to hang out
77:26 - and turn those acquaintances into
77:29 - friends and then by the time you're
77:31 - ready to go on the job hunt you
77:32 - ultimately want hundreds of people that
77:35 - you've interacted with over the past
77:36 - year that you could go to and say Hey
77:39 - you saw me where I was here's where I'm
77:40 - at now who should I talk to I'm looking
77:43 - for a job and that's really successful
77:45 - for people so that's phase one of
77:47 - networking phase two is once you go on
77:49 - the hunt it's very targeted we call it
77:51 - building our Hit List where we identify
77:53 - the companies that are Act ly hiring we
77:56 - identify like three to five people at
77:58 - each of those companies and we're doing
78:00 - Outreach to um get in communication with
78:03 - those folks learn more and what we're
78:05 - finding is
78:06 - that a lot of jobs just don't get posted
78:10 - a lot of times folks will be applying
78:12 - for one job that they wind up getting a
78:14 - different one just because they like the
78:16 - person like right we we have this idea
78:18 - that like Tech is this like meritocracy
78:20 - where if you know the skills you get the
78:22 - job it's not it's like people want to
78:24 - work with people that they like they
78:25 - want to work with people that they know
78:26 - and trust and you can you can make that
78:29 - happen for yourself by really kind of
78:31 - going this networking your way in
78:35 - pathway so the term
78:37 - meritocracy is it was like actually like
78:41 - a joke because the author was like this
78:44 - doesn't exist this is absurd like it's
78:47 - who you know and like you're skill
78:49 - unless you're I mean even like the most
78:52 - demonstrably good pianists for example
78:55 - to talk about pianos we talked about it
78:56 - earlier like somebody saw you know um
79:00 - skill in them and like help them get
79:02 - obser you know enrolled in some
79:04 - Observatory or they had the time to play
79:07 - piano a lot with all the other kids who
79:08 - were working in the shoe factory you
79:10 - know in the you know Industrial
79:13 - Revolution or whatever right like like
79:14 - it takes so and everybody's
79:17 - circumstances are different so I just
79:19 - want to like put the bed because I've
79:21 - never talked about this on the podcast
79:23 - but we don't use the word meritocracy on
79:25 - here except to say that things aren't a
79:27 - meritocracy because they aren't it's
79:29 - ridiculous to think that they are uh the
79:31 - the person who came up with it I think
79:32 - in a book was like just joking about it
79:36 - um yeah
79:40 - yeah he he defined meritocracy as like I
79:43 - think effort and intelligence and how do
79:46 - you build intelligence through effort
79:48 - right some of it may be like you know
79:51 - endowed upon you uh but for most part we
79:54 - all work really hard I study you know
79:57 - foreign languages like an hour a day I
79:59 - play bass an hour a day you know and
80:02 - like I still suck at those things but
80:04 - sucking at something is the first step
80:05 - to being good at something right um so I
80:09 - also wanted this describe or like Define
80:12 - like an acronym uh ATS is uh applicant
80:15 - tracking system system yeah yeah when
80:18 - you apply through like a web form you're
80:20 - like applying into some algorithm that's
80:22 - going to be say okay we didn't ask if
80:23 - they have a college degree because it's
80:25 - hip to say that we don't look for people
80:27 - who have college degrees but in reality
80:29 - our system is going to just filter you
80:31 - out because you don't have a college
80:32 - degree we didn't put it on the thing but
80:35 - you know I I think I I heard some uh
80:37 - study that like uh it was a recent study
80:39 - like 700 job postings that didn't say
80:42 - they required a degree like zero people
80:44 - got those jobs for software engineering
80:47 - for those roles even though they didn't
80:49 - say because if you don't have a degree
80:51 - the ATS just simply filters you out no
80:53 - human ever even reviews right but like
80:56 - the way I got my first job as a do as a
80:58 - developer was through meetup.com going
81:00 - to like local Ruby developer Meetup and
81:03 - I got a job as a rails developer and the
81:04 - interview was very similar maybe you can
81:07 - describe the typical interview the
81:08 - hunter devs folks go through because
81:10 - it's not like Elite code whiteboard
81:12 - maybe for some of them but a lot of it
81:14 - is like hey I've already seen your
81:15 - projects I know you can code are you a
81:18 - good fit for our organization right it's
81:20 - about
81:21 - 5050 we're talking across hundreds of
81:23 - people that have gotten jobs that I've
81:25 - like literally seen right and people
81:27 - have come and talked about them during
81:28 - our huddles so we have a celebrations
81:31 - channel on our Discord where you can
81:32 - like go through and see hundreds of
81:34 - people their stories how they got the
81:36 - jobs what the interviews were like and
81:37 - so that's really powerful to know that
81:40 - but it's about 50/50 and it's when they
81:42 - when they do an
81:44 - interview we're talking about sometimes
81:47 - there's not going to be like Elite code
81:48 - style portion there's still going to be
81:50 - behavioral questions there's still going
81:52 - to be technical questions you're still
81:53 - going to be walking through a process
81:54 - project you might do some light like
81:56 - coding together but for about half the
81:59 - folks that have gotten jobs they haven't
82:00 - done like a leak code style question the
82:02 - other half you will and then there's
82:04 - varying degrees of it and so so many
82:07 - folks focus on like grinding out Le code
82:09 - until their eyes bleed and it's like
82:10 - yeah if you're going for Fang sure that
82:12 - needs to be the thing that you do but if
82:14 - you're going for a local health care
82:16 - company in your medium-sized city
82:19 - they're probably not going to know like
82:22 - like they're probably not going to go
82:23 - through and do that level of
82:24 - interviewing and so one of the things we
82:26 - always say is like don't go into your
82:28 - interviews like an accident always ask
82:31 - what you're about to walk into they'll
82:32 - tell you like almost every single time
82:34 - if you just say like hey like I'm
82:35 - putting a lot of time and energy into
82:37 - this application I would really
82:39 - appreciate just being fully prepared
82:41 - what am I about to walk into in this
82:42 - interview and they'll tell you oh you're
82:44 - just going to meet with so and so and
82:45 - talk through a project great now you
82:47 - know how to prep for That interview
82:48 - don't ever go into an interview if you
82:49 - don't know what you're about to walk
82:50 - into and so about half of our jobs have
82:53 - been not really needing some of those
82:55 - more aggressive skills but it's a huge
82:58 - smell test it's a sniff test uh we like
83:01 - to say every single person that starts
83:02 - off at 100 Dev smells there's something
83:05 - about you that's going to stop you from
83:06 - getting the job and it's your job to
83:08 - like figure out what it is get rid of
83:10 - the smell and make sure you come across
83:13 - as a cool confident professional that's
83:17 - done this been there and has ready to
83:19 - get to work and if you can do that
83:21 - you're going to be really successful
83:22 - getting jobs and even focus that want to
83:25 - go the other more traditional interviews
83:26 - with like the leak codes and things like
83:28 - that you're still passing a sniff test I
83:30 - have seen folks that I consider just
83:33 - amazing even done like competitive
83:35 - programming that do well in interviews
83:37 - and don't get the job and they wonder
83:38 - why and then you look at the resume and
83:40 - you look at how they present themselves
83:42 - and their narrative all that stuff
83:44 - matters it really matters you need to
83:46 - invest time in opening that those doors
83:48 - as well yeah absolutely and I just want
83:51 - to emphasize like if you can figure out
83:54 - what that
83:55 - smell is maybe it's that I don't have a
83:56 - degree and like I'm getting filtered out
83:58 - of ATS or or people are just not looking
84:00 - at me as a serious per like a serious
84:03 - candidate just based on that virtue you
84:04 - can absolutely correct for that and I
84:06 - have lots of friends like free C like
84:07 - lots of people on the free C Camp team
84:09 - dropped out of college or never even
84:11 - went to college right um and it's it's
84:13 - just one of those things where you have
84:15 - to figure out like and empathize with
84:17 - like the HR person or whoever you're
84:19 - talking to and figure out what it is
84:20 - they're they're sniffing for because
84:23 - usually they're just trying to figure
84:24 - out a way to quickly weed people out
84:26 - yeah so to speak so they don't have to
84:28 - inter right once you know like I don't
84:30 - know one of the things we try really
84:31 - hard at 100 devs is to like make sure
84:32 - you know all the like hacks and the
84:34 - secrets and like what's really happening
84:36 - and so recruiters are using some sort of
84:38 - like we said ATS some sort of filter you
84:41 - know what to add to your resume to get
84:42 - past those filters we use things like CV
84:44 - compiler which is like a website that'll
84:46 - tell you like what you're missing um we
84:48 - have like our own resume template that's
84:49 - like battle tested we follow like the
84:52 - true f-shaped pattern like if you watch
84:54 - recruiters with eye tracking there's a
84:56 - video that's going really popular it's
84:57 - done it again where you like watch the
84:59 - way they look they read left or right
85:01 - like most folks that read English
85:02 - they're looking for those specific
85:04 - keywords at the frontload of the f-shape
85:06 - pattern right so if you know these
85:07 - things you can you can get past these
85:11 - like screen segments and the other thing
85:14 - is people really need to work on how
85:15 - they talk about themselves people people
85:18 - go into the hunt too humble this is your
85:21 - this is like your one chance in life to
85:23 - talk your talk uh be proud of your
85:25 - previous experience I don't care what
85:26 - you've done having that pre PRI pre like
85:30 - previous experience makes you a badass
85:32 - and brings different skills to the table
85:34 - than someone that did a four-year CS has
85:36 - only ever worked in computer science
85:38 - like they're there're you're different
85:40 - and that difference can be a value ad to
85:42 - a lot of companies and so knowing how to
85:44 - craft that into a narrative like a
85:45 - logical reason from what you were doing
85:48 - to why you're the best software engineer
85:49 - they have in their candidate pool and
85:51 - being able to talk about yourself highly
85:53 - is super important so if you're
85:55 - listening what is your narrative what is
85:57 - your story why are you the coolest thing
85:59 - since sliced bread walking into that
86:00 - interview and that's what we do a lot
86:02 - during like our huddles and at 100 do we
86:04 - have whole nights where we just craft
86:06 - stories we'll have dozens of people come
86:08 - up they give us their their life history
86:10 - and we craft the narrative live and then
86:13 - you just see an instant difference in in
86:15 - how they're going through applications
86:17 - yeah and so first of all I would love if
86:21 - you can share the links to those uh the
86:22 - CV I'll pull up C compil like if you
86:25 - have resume template and like we we've
86:28 - talked a lot about um 100s and I feel
86:32 - like we could talk a whole lot more
86:33 - first of all I want to make sure you
86:34 - still have a few minutes finish I'm good
86:36 - to go for as long as you'll have me
86:38 - awesome well that's great news um the
86:41 - the main uh the main limiter is going to
86:43 - be the fact that I've drinken like
86:44 - literally like two liters of tea while
86:45 - I'm standing here talking with you so I
86:47 - may have to go to the bathroom at some
86:49 - point but what we um what I really want
86:52 - is just to tease out as many like high
86:54 - level insights that we can get into this
86:57 - podcast like like I just want to end on
86:59 - as many pieces of actionable advice as
87:02 - you can share as somebody who has become
87:05 - a developer worked as a software
87:06 - engineer who's even like built a
87:08 - successful project I guess three or two
87:11 - projects and then you're very actively
87:13 - high high up in resilient coders too
87:15 - which sounds like a really uh and I want
87:18 - to tease as many of those out of you as
87:20 - I can sure uh for the for the benefit of
87:22 - the audience and for the benefit of
87:23 - myself I've been furiously taking notes
87:25 - through this whole thing
87:28 - so some questions I have are
87:32 - um I guess what are some questions I
87:34 - should be asking what what are some
87:36 - interesting things that people never ask
87:38 - you that like are really helpful um that
87:41 - would be helpful for the many people out
87:43 - there learning the code well well okay
87:46 - what is a big mistake we can we can
87:49 - think about that maybe you can think of
87:50 - some other uh things but what is a big
87:51 - mistake that you see developers make
87:53 - other than
87:54 - you know over optimizing on their skills
87:57 - for example and and not enough on their
87:59 - Network or their reputation or figuring
88:00 - out how to empathize with recruiters and
88:03 - and I I don't mean like he buddies with
88:05 - them but like you always want to
88:07 - understand other people's perspectives
88:09 - there's no disadvantage to having more
88:13 - perspectives kind of compacted in your
88:15 - head being able to build with more
88:17 - verisimilitude models of other people
88:21 - and how they're approaching the world
88:23 - and what they're looking for how you can
88:25 - find the job that needs to be done and
88:26 - you can do it for that person right yeah
88:29 - I guess I'll I'll gear it towards folks
88:31 - that are like learning how to code and
88:32 - trying to get a job I think the biggest
88:35 - mistake outside of the things like not
88:36 - investing early in networking and um
88:39 - over investing in things that aren't
88:40 - going to really move the needle in terms
88:42 - of you getting a job is there's there's
88:44 - two things that I
88:45 - think lead to most folks not being
88:49 - successful and the number one thing is
88:52 - going into your day is like an accident
88:55 - if you're going into your days like an
88:56 - accident and you don't have a game plan
88:58 - for your day your week your month and
89:01 - you're trying to commit to a process
89:02 - that's going to take years you're not
89:04 - going to be successful and I've worked
89:06 - from with folks from all different walks
89:08 - of life the folks that make a plan for
89:11 - what they want like what do you want for
89:12 - yourself what do you want for your
89:14 - family what do you want for your loved
89:15 - ones like what do you want and then what
89:17 - are the steps you're going to take to
89:19 - get there that plan helps you get
89:22 - through the trough ofar it helps you get
89:23 - through through the the days where you
89:25 - don't have motivation when the
89:27 - discipline is is is is fleeting how do
89:30 - you stay true to like what you want and
89:33 - you should have it written down you
89:34 - should have it on your wall you should
89:35 - you should there's a reason why I have
89:37 - your photo as like the background of my
89:39 - wallpaper every once in a while is
89:41 - because I need to know what I'm shooting
89:42 - for and like what do I want like what do
89:44 - I want for myself what do I want for my
89:45 - community and like having that why go
89:48 - everyone that's that's trying to learn
89:49 - code needs to go on some long walks with
89:52 - no podcast no music no anything thing
89:54 - and just ask yourself what do I want
89:56 - like what's my future like what do I
89:57 - want for myself because until you have
89:59 - that it's really hard to to push through
90:02 - and so I have a lot of people that come
90:04 - and they they say they want it but they
90:06 - only kind of want it right there's like
90:08 - a very famous Dr Eric Thomas speech like
90:10 - they just kind of want it and until you
90:12 - really want it and that can come from a
90:14 - lot of different ways it can come from
90:15 - being [ __ ] hungry it can come from uh
90:18 - wanting the respect of your your family
90:20 - like it can come from a lot of different
90:21 - places but until you have that you're
90:23 - not going to you're not going to make it
90:24 - through um and yeah so having that
90:27 - hammered down and really having it
90:29 - visible putting it somewhere on the wall
90:31 - like knowing what it is and then every
90:35 - day before I go to bed I write out the
90:38 - three things I want to get done the next
90:39 - day once a month I what are my goals for
90:42 - the month once a year like not once a
90:44 - year every couple months like what am I
90:45 - trying to get done for the year and I I
90:47 - hold myself to it and the last piece
90:49 - I'll say about this is I get Buy in from
90:51 - the folks that matter most to me so it's
90:54 - not something internal to me like I know
90:55 - if I want to be successful in this I
90:57 - need to get the Buy in of my my wife
91:00 - right hey this is the thing I want to do
91:02 - it's going to take a lot of time it's
91:04 - going to take some nights and weekends
91:06 - away from us being together and and with
91:08 - our family and I I need you to
91:10 - understand why I'm doing it why it's
91:13 - important and can I have a little bit of
91:15 - your trust and I'll prove that to you
91:17 - over time that it's worthwhile
91:19 - investment but I need you to know like
91:21 - why I'm doing this and get that buy in
91:23 - um because you don't have that buy in
91:25 - especially if you're like stay still at
91:26 - home with family that doesn't get it if
91:29 - you're um not being as present with your
91:33 - loved ones there that that's going to
91:35 - build up some resentment and for a lot
91:37 - of folks that's another reason why
91:38 - they're not successful so yeah don't go
91:40 - into your days like an accident have a
91:41 - plan for your days know what your why is
91:43 - and get Buy in from the folks that
91:45 - matter most yeah that getting Buy in is
91:47 - so important because learning to codes a
91:50 - long long journey and you get all hyped
91:53 - up you get like these uh you know
91:55 - probably YouTube ads or um you know ads
91:58 - on the side of your coding tutorials
92:00 - learn to code in just three months and
92:01 - get a job paying like 200k and like you
92:05 - know whatever you know and to be fair
92:07 - there are plenty of developers who do
92:10 - learn to code very quickly and do get
92:12 - jobs uh I've had lots of friends who
92:14 - transitioned from working on Wall Street
92:16 - and they went to some expensive
92:18 - intensive coding program and they were
92:20 - able to then go get a job in Silicon
92:23 - Valley but they already had college
92:25 - degrees uh they already had you know
92:27 - like probably figured out how to plan uh
92:30 - they they probably had an understanding
92:33 - of like a lot of the you know learning
92:36 - techniques that we've been talking about
92:38 - and and most importantly they had a lot
92:39 - of money and they were able to just
92:40 - focus on it exclusively and and attend
92:43 - an intensive in-person boot camp like
92:45 - and and that era may have passed it may
92:47 - be that it's just a little harder now uh
92:50 - to to be able to get a job just because
92:52 - you should learn math right like
92:54 - it used to be back in the day you could
92:56 - just learn some WordPress and you could
92:58 - probably go get some clients doing
92:59 - WordPress work and it may be that case
93:01 - but with the global market and the level
93:03 - of competition you're going to get from
93:04 - places like India Nigeria China like
93:07 - tons of extremely educated extremely
93:11 - hungry people are coming from all these
93:14 - places and you know frankly they're
93:17 - going to eat your lunch if you're not
93:18 - putting in the time and effort Benjamin
93:19 - Franklin said few people plan to fail
93:23 - most people who
93:24 - fail fail the plan that's a paraphrase
93:27 - of what he said it's not exct no it's
93:29 - perfect yeah but but it is like 100%
93:31 - what Leon's saying here um and uh yeah
93:34 - so I just want to emphasize like getting
93:36 - Buy in from your family like when I
93:38 - learned a code again I don't want to
93:40 - make this all about me but like I told
93:43 - my wife like hey like I've got this job
93:45 - as a soft as a School director right and
93:47 - I would like to become a software
93:48 - engineer and we had doubled income we
93:51 - had insurance which is a huge deal here
93:53 - in the US
93:54 - uh through her work and so even if I
93:57 - left my job we we could continue to have
93:59 - health insurance and I just grinded
94:01 - every single day and I every I did
94:03 - precisely what you're talking about
94:04 - planning out okay what am I going to
94:06 - accomplish the next few days because
94:08 - planning is everything like it it's so
94:10 - important to have a plan and to stick to
94:13 - a plan and to have goals that are
94:15 - measurable and that are within your
94:17 - control that's another mistake I see a
94:19 - lot of people make is people will be
94:21 - like my goal is to get you know 100,000
94:23 - YouTube subscribers this year or my goal
94:26 - is to get you know a job paying like
94:29 - n1,000 or or to get n freelance clients
94:32 - you know those are not things that you
94:34 - can directly control you can't control
94:36 - the outcome but you can control the
94:38 - input my my goal is to play base for an
94:41 - hour a day right or you know whatever
94:43 - goal I might have at a given moment uh
94:45 - yeah James James Clear of like Atomic
94:47 - habits has that very famous quote that I
94:49 - love so much that he says we don't rise
94:51 - to the level of our goals we fall to the
94:53 - levels of our systems and so this idea
94:56 - like we can have all these lofty goals
94:57 - but if you're not putting in the systems
94:59 - the how you're going to study uh play
95:01 - the Basse for an hour each day study
95:03 - your languages for an hour each day and
95:05 - and the process for that uh it's just
95:07 - not going to work out for you in the
95:08 - long run absolutely
95:11 - so we've talked a lot and of course you
95:14 - and I we grew up in the US you grew up
95:16 - in Philly I grew up in Oklahoma City um
95:19 - and you know here in the US even though
95:21 - things are not equal by aone shot it's
95:24 - very unequal Society we still have
95:27 - vestages of you
95:30 - know history yeah going back 400 years
95:33 - right like uh they warp uh the
95:37 - essentially The Haves and the Have Nots
95:39 - and um but in the US we're pretty well
95:43 - off compared to folks in a lot of
95:46 - countries uh for example like the hyper
95:49 - competition in places like India and
95:51 - China where you've got like so many
95:54 - people getting like CS degrees and
95:56 - trying to compete and so few employers
95:58 - or Nigeria where there are so many
96:01 - amazing developers like I think it's
96:03 - like the third or fourth largest
96:04 - community in free Cod Camp people that
96:07 - use free C Camp is Nigeria but if you
96:09 - look at Nigeria there aren't a lot of
96:11 - big employers and the government's kind
96:13 - of a mess and as a result there's not a
96:15 - lot of opportunity even though there's a
96:16 - lot of talent so a lot of those people
96:18 - have to move overseas to like Europe or
96:21 - to to the United States or wherever they
96:23 - can find opportunity right like a lot of
96:26 - the what is the proportion of people
96:29 - doing 100 devs who are outside of the US
96:31 - and uh how what have you observed about
96:34 - those people that that might be helpful
96:36 - for them uh yeah and and like just a
96:39 - followup questional tack on is like do
96:40 - they need to move to the US to be able
96:42 - to be successful in software engineering
96:44 - or are there other paths you've seen
96:46 - people succeed with yeah so I would say
96:48 - about half our community is from the US
96:50 - and about half is from everywhere else
96:52 - in fact the first jobs we ever got got
96:53 - were not from the US they were from
96:55 - Brazil then Poland UK and then a bunch
96:58 - of other places in South America uh and
97:01 - so a lot of our community and folks that
97:03 - have gotten jobs haven't been from the
97:05 - like us Centric and so the first thing I
97:07 - always say is whenever somebody from
97:08 - outside the US says I want to get a
97:12 - job I just tell them bluntly it's way
97:15 - harder don't let anyone convince you
97:17 - that it's going to be the same pathway
97:19 - as somebody from the US it's going to be
97:20 - a way more difficult journey and there's
97:22 - a very couple of like very key things
97:24 - that you have to keep in mind um one the
97:27 - Visa sponsorship ISS issue in the United
97:30 - States is wild it goes to a lottery most
97:33 - years right and so banking on that is
97:35 - like a pathway into an engineering
97:37 - career if you're from a area that
97:39 - doesn't have like that strong of a local
97:40 - Tech economy is very hard the
97:42 - competition for companies that hire
97:45 - remotely is brutal and it's even more
97:48 - brutal when you look at the companies
97:49 - that hire globally so a lot of people
97:51 - think oh I'll get a remote Tech job no
97:53 - even even though they're remote they
97:54 - only hire folks from the US or from a
97:56 - very specific select countries so
97:58 - finding a a group of folks that hire
98:02 - globally remotely uh that's a very
98:05 - narrow pool so the first thing I would
98:07 - recommend that you do is build a hit
98:10 - list of those companies there are list
98:11 - you can find online there are couple
98:13 - hundred of those companies you need to
98:15 - be best friends with everybody that
98:16 - works at that company and you mentioned
98:19 - building your reputation this is
98:20 - something I really recommend folks that
98:22 - are coming from from uh a location do to
98:24 - have a traditional Tech economy is your
98:27 - reputation matters a lot we talk about
98:29 - building authority a lot in 100 Dev so
98:31 - picking a niche or a topic that you know
98:34 - very very well generating content around
98:36 - it so when somebody thinks about I don't
98:38 - know authentication they think about you
98:40 - and the blog post you've written and the
98:42 - depth of knowledge that you can bring
98:43 - that way when you're applying to these
98:45 - Global remote companies you have
98:47 - something that nobody else really has
98:48 - this like intangible thing that helps
98:50 - set you apart and so the first thing I
98:52 - say it's harder
98:54 - building authority or reputation is
98:55 - super important and not going into your
98:58 - job search like an accident it's not
99:00 - going to happen if you don't have a very
99:01 - strong game plan and you're building the
99:04 - references and helping pass that sniff
99:07 - test that these companies are putting
99:09 - out there if you do those things you'll
99:10 - be successful we've helped hundreds of
99:12 - people in that situation get a job it's
99:13 - just a way more difficult pathway yeah
99:16 - and uh just on that note of like
99:19 - building authority like what are some of
99:21 - the most I guess immediate things
99:24 - someone can do like let's say you
99:25 - already have the skills let's say you've
99:27 - been coding for a long time and you just
99:29 - want to be able to get a job preferably
99:32 - at like a multinational company many of
99:34 - which are of course us-based um and you
99:37 - would love over the next five or 10
99:39 - years to eventually get a visa and come
99:41 - to the US where salaries are like double
99:43 - what they are in Europe and and where we
99:45 - have a high degree of Freedom that
99:47 - people in other countries don't
99:48 - necessarily enjoy I mean it it is a good
99:51 - place to live like uh I like living in
99:53 - the us right I guess it's easier for me
99:55 - to say that it's like a middle class guy
99:58 - uh who speaks English natively and has
100:00 - US citizenship and doesn't have to deal
100:01 - with like my H1B you know being shifted
100:04 - around and like getting companies to
100:06 - sponsor me and all that stuff but like
100:07 - like I can definitely understand the
100:09 - appeal I can understand why so many
100:10 - people are trying you know to immigrate
100:13 - to the US every day but like what would
100:17 - be some uh practical ways that they can
100:19 - establish Authority as you said yeah so
100:23 - I think when you are trying to stand out
100:27 - amongst lots of other talented
100:30 - individuals doesn't have to be anything
100:32 - wild uh I really do think building a
100:35 - list of companies that are on your
100:36 - targeted range um and the H1B processes
100:39 - we I I've helped sponsor a lot of h-1bs
100:41 - like it's we could talk about like
100:43 - that's a whole other beast in of itself
100:45 - that's like you have to be of an
100:46 - exceptional talent you have to do these
100:48 - things to help you stand out like that's
100:49 - a whole other thing you're talking about
100:50 - like Global remote company like what can
100:52 - you do right now I'm thinking about
100:52 - somebody right now that wants to to to
100:55 - to get a a job my my process probably
100:58 - wouldn't be the H1B coming to the US
101:00 - right away it' be these like Global
101:02 - remote companies and then maybe
101:04 - expanding to companies that could
101:06 - sponsor um but a lot of times you're
101:08 - going to need more more credentials
101:11 - you're going to need like degrees might
101:12 - actually become a Thing If you're trying
101:14 - to go that sponsorship route um so I
101:16 - recommend right now if you're someone in
101:19 - Nigeria or India um looking at these
101:22 - Global hire in remote companies figuring
101:25 - out what they do building a list of them
101:27 - building a list of all the people that
101:29 - you know that work there adding them to
101:31 - a Twitter list right like each person
101:33 - add them to a Twitter list start
101:35 - engaging with their content just liking
101:37 - stuff at first don't be spamming don't
101:39 - be weird just like engaging with them
101:42 - liking their content congratulating them
101:44 - when they get a a new project built
101:46 - right like building that network of
101:48 - folks that know who you are over time
101:51 - like you become like an acquaintance
101:52 - like you can go from nobody to like they
101:54 - have no idea who you are to an
101:55 - acquaintance just by regular interaction
101:58 - on LinkedIn Twitter and it's there's a
102:00 - fine line between like being weird with
102:01 - it right we at 100 do we always joke
102:03 - it's not stalking it's networking and so
102:06 - you want to make sure that you're not
102:06 - like Crossing that line um and then
102:10 - starting to realize what these companies
102:12 - have trouble with right like you're
102:14 - you're engaging with these content
102:16 - you're seeing the things that they're
102:17 - doing are they having trouble
102:19 - implementing I don't know AI or llms
102:23 - great right that's the content you need
102:24 - to start generating build your Authority
102:26 - about how do they integrate these tools
102:30 - into their daily process you should have
102:32 - a Blog you should have um a YouTube you
102:36 - should have something where you're
102:37 - putting content out there you're getting
102:39 - feedback from them and from community of
102:41 - some sort to where you're building up
102:44 - that hey I I'm not just somebody that
102:45 - says I do this you can you can look at
102:47 - my content you can look at the things
102:48 - I'm doing uh you can look at the the
102:50 - things that I say I've done and be able
102:52 - to see that very clearly
102:53 - and also by doing that you're practicing
102:56 - how you talk about these things you're
102:57 - practicing um maybe if English is your
103:00 - second language you're getting more
103:01 - comfortable with these things that when
103:03 - it comes time the pass the sniff test
103:05 - you are because these people you've been
103:07 - engaging with for a year plus they've
103:09 - seen your content they know who you are
103:11 - they know what you're capable of that
103:13 - makes getting into these orgs a little
103:14 - bit easier absolutely 100% agreed uh
103:18 - based on my limited knowledge I I think
103:20 - it sounds like you have a lot more
103:21 - knowledge about that so what I would
103:23 - like to ask then is like let's flip this
103:25 - around employers who want to bring in
103:29 - more folks uh and and this can we can we
103:31 - can definitely start by talking about
103:33 - folks from overseas if you want Talent
103:36 - if you want to be able to tap that
103:37 - talent and you don't want to like go to
103:39 - some consultancy or something in some
103:41 - other country and say give me like 20
103:42 - devs right go to infosis or whatever
103:44 - like you want to literally get the best
103:46 - talent from India or from Nigeria just
103:50 - by picking developer by developer
103:52 - yourself you're trying to build out your
103:53 - company or or you're a hiring manager
103:55 - and you're just trying to build a team
103:56 - you're you know like what strategies
103:59 - what advice would you give to those
104:00 - people so that they can actually find
104:03 - talented people and what should they be
104:05 - looking for yeah I think Partnerships
104:07 - are really great so we work with a lot
104:08 - of hiring Partners at resilient coders
104:11 - we've sent dozens of folks to Amazon
104:13 - through resilient coders we sent we have
104:15 - these very strong Partnerships with a
104:17 - lot of orgs that need a good solid
104:20 - pipeline of talent and so partnering
104:22 - with communities is a really good way to
104:23 - do that um if you came to RC res coders
104:26 - or you came to 100 devs and you said
104:28 - give me the best of the best I would
104:30 - talk to you I'd make sure that your job
104:32 - is doing all the things that it needs to
104:34 - be done to be do to be done equitably
104:35 - and if I felt that that was the case I
104:37 - would give you all the folks you would
104:39 - have a pipeline that was full for days
104:41 - of Highly qualified incredibly talented
104:45 - Talent um from wherever you needed them
104:48 - to be from or or or anywhere you'd want
104:50 - to support as well like we can make that
104:51 - happen and so I think think for folks
104:54 - that are looking for a good pipeline
104:56 - just working with communities so I would
104:58 - of course say working with myself you um
105:01 - I always think of uh Paris black Tech
105:03 - pipeline does this work really well
105:05 - where they're able to get you a very
105:07 - strong source of talent um from anywhere
105:10 - from entry level to super senior uh and
105:12 - so figuring out these different orgs
105:15 - that have a surplus of talented
105:18 - engineering Talent um could be a great
105:21 - way to build those those funnels for you
105:23 - yeah absolutely and then uh for
105:26 - organizations that just want to be more
105:29 - representative of the folks in their
105:31 - Community let's say like it's not
105:32 - necessarily remote but here in the US uh
105:36 - Los Angeles for example like there's a
105:39 - tech startup and they're looking for
105:40 - engineers what I guess General tips
105:43 - would you give to employers so that they
105:46 - can they can be inclusive and they can
105:47 - make sure that they're bringing on
105:48 - talent that actually represents the
105:50 - local population instead of just
105:51 - bringing in a bunch of you know Stanford
105:53 - GRS or something like that right yeah I
105:55 - I think it takes Champions within a
105:57 - company that actually care about these
105:58 - things of course you can read like the
106:00 - McKenzie reports a more diverse
106:01 - Workforce equals better outcomes right
106:03 - so a lot of companies know these things
106:04 - to be true but it takes someone on the
106:07 - inside that cares about building an
106:09 - equitable Workforce for this to actually
106:10 - happen especially when things like Dei
106:13 - and these initiatives are being
106:14 - contested in the courts a lot of
106:16 - companies are becoming a little bit more
106:19 - um shy around being ten toes down right
106:23 - and so I think if this is the case it
106:25 - really doesn't come from top down it
106:27 - comes from individuals looking around
106:30 - and saying you know what I live in a
106:32 - community that is 25% black and brown
106:36 - but only 1% of our Workforce is of color
106:39 - there's something fundamentally wrong
106:40 - here when we looked in Boston where I
106:42 - spent most of my career we had the
106:44 - second largest tech economy but double
106:47 - digit unemployment rates in our
106:48 - communities of color there's a there's a
106:49 - fundamental mismatch and so we had a
106:52 - group of individuals that realized that
106:54 - this is just woly inequitable and they
106:57 - would go to town they would go to fight
106:59 - the fight every single day to bring one
107:02 - person along than to bring two along and
107:05 - the thing is it can compound once you
107:08 - have folks in these positions of power
107:10 - you can turn around and help lift up
107:12 - more along with you so I don't think it
107:14 - needs to be like like a companywide
107:16 - thing I think anybody that's listening
107:17 - to this call has this ability to fight
107:19 - for what they know is right to turn
107:21 - around and say you know what I want want
107:23 - to make an equitable pathway in my
107:25 - company and I'm going to work really
107:26 - really hard for the next open rule for
107:28 - it to be someone that deserves to be
107:31 - here but might not have the
107:33 - opportunity yeah and that's a huge part
107:36 - of 100 devs like as far as I can tell
107:39 - from like listening to a lot of your
107:41 - episodes and stuff like instead of
107:44 - asking people to like necessarily donate
107:46 - to 100 FS or uh like you tell them send
107:49 - the elevator back down is is something
107:51 - you've said a few times like like try
107:54 - for every one of the 100 devs cohort
107:58 - members the the Learners they should try
108:01 - to find somebody else who's in Alum and
108:03 - bring them onto their company so they
108:05 - can kind of uh essentially be increasing
108:09 - the number of alumni within these
108:11 - organizations in the free software
108:12 - Community we have a word grus right it's
108:15 - not it's not free it's grus meaning that
108:17 - there's like no cost like there's no
108:19 - like monetary cost and so 100 devs is
108:23 - grce I mean there's no like money should
108:25 - no money should ever come out of your
108:26 - pocket I never want to see a dollar come
108:27 - out of your pocket for anything um
108:29 - there's no way that you can give us that
108:31 - dollar we don't want it but it's not
108:32 - free and the reason why it's not free is
108:35 - because we expect that when you get the
108:37 - job that you turn around and help three
108:39 - more get into the same position that you
108:41 - have whether it's helping answer
108:43 - questions whether it is literally
108:45 - helping people apply and get into the
108:47 - pipeline for your company the the
108:49 - expectation is that this community has
108:52 - in invested thousands and hours into
108:55 - your success and the thing that we ask
108:58 - is that you turn around and give a
108:59 - little bit of that time back and that's
109:02 - the reason why 100 death has been so
109:03 - successful is that we have folks that
109:04 - have made it to the the upper echelon
109:07 - that are now senior developers at the
109:10 - best tech companies in the world that
109:12 - are still giving up their time every
109:14 - single day on our Discord and our
109:16 - huddles to make sure that the next folks
109:18 - are
109:20 - successful that is a beautiful note to
109:23 - end on just the the the virtue of this
109:26 - organization that You' birthed into the
109:28 - world uh but let's not end quite yet
109:31 - because I want to ask what are the
109:32 - future initiatives what yeah does the
109:35 - next what what does 2024 the rest of
109:37 - 2024 maybe even 2025 2026 free we think
109:40 - literally a decade out like we're
109:42 - working on this computer science degree
109:43 - program that will take another six years
109:45 - to complete all the course workk for
109:47 - plus another five years to gather
109:49 - longitudinal data plus probably another
109:50 - five years to have the data AC you know
109:54 - approved by accreditor so we can get uh
109:56 - the degree program accredited free
109:58 - computer science uh bachelor's degree
110:00 - free which I was super on I don't I I
110:03 - was tweeting up a story I was telling
110:05 - everybody and their mom I was running
110:07 - and showing my wife like look this is
110:08 - this is this is the future like this is
110:10 - this is the thing that uh we need the
110:13 - most in the world right now and so I'm
110:15 - super happy that that's like on your
110:17 - your vision education wants to be free
110:20 - yeah exactly like this is it right like
110:22 - doing the work like and like we said
110:23 - earlier I I think free C Camp is amazing
110:26 - at identifying the real gaps like the
110:29 - things that people really need to be
110:31 - successful and filling them and having a
110:33 - community that's willing to step up and
110:35 - do that work to fill those gaps um so
110:38 - something I the reason why it's the best
110:41 - donation I make every single week it's
110:42 - the reason why um I always uh send folks
110:46 - to free code count because I know that
110:47 - they're in safe hands to like get the
110:49 - things they need done yeah um free isn't
110:52 - free for everyone right in terms of time
110:55 - and commitment a lot of folks that would
110:58 - be extremely successful at 100 devs
111:01 - right like the the the cliche line is
111:03 - that like
111:04 - um skill and talent is distributed
111:08 - opportunity is not right and so we have
111:11 - a lot of folks that are extremely
111:12 - talented that um could be phenomenal
111:15 - software Engineers but don't have the
111:17 - opportunity or the privilege of time
111:19 - they need to take that time they would
111:20 - be spending learning d driving for Uber
111:23 - doing door Dash they they need to take
111:26 - that time to put food on the table for
111:27 - their family and when we pulled our our
111:30 - our Collective we we saw that folks
111:32 - really only needed around $200 a week to
111:36 - like make this a viable pathway so our
111:40 - huge big goal is to build out an agency
111:44 - model where real companies come they
111:48 - have work that they need for us to to
111:50 - accomplish we have super season
111:52 - profession Professional Engineers that
111:53 - lead those projects and then we break
111:56 - those projects down into individual
111:58 - issues or tasks so that as you're
112:00 - learning you're also maybe picking up
112:02 - some of these tasks in a real code base
112:04 - like your skills become intensely
112:06 - practical and by the time you graduate
112:09 - or leave 100 devs you've built real
112:10 - projects for real companies with
112:12 - production level code and all the money
112:15 - that comes into the agency goes directly
112:17 - into those issues so that you're also
112:18 - getting a little bit of money coming in
112:20 - as you're working through it and we
112:21 - think that might make our program more
112:25 - Equitable for folks that just don't have
112:27 - that last little bit of privilege of
112:29 - free time and so like I said we talked
112:32 - about earlier we're a group of people
112:34 - that run head first into really big
112:35 - audacious goals sometimes it works
112:37 - sometimes it doesn't we're going to have
112:38 - a lot of mistakes a lot of things are
112:39 - going to go wrong but we're going to
112:41 - figure it out and our goal is that when
112:43 - we launch our next cohort uh we also
112:46 - have this agency model in place as well
112:48 - so that you're not only learning but
112:50 - getting this practical paid experience
112:51 - as well yeah that's so cool I mean
112:53 - that's like we're all about taking away
112:56 - excuses from people like and and like to
112:59 - be fair like a lot of excuses like if
113:01 - you have young kids or if you're taking
113:02 - care of your folks if you're working
113:04 - like three jobs to be able to pay
113:06 - exorbitant rent in your city you know
113:08 - like those are very reasonable reasons
113:11 - for not being able to spend a lot of
113:13 - time coding but if there are things you
113:15 - can do to remove some of those barriers
113:18 - uh to to make it easier for people to
113:20 - commit to an already arduous process of
113:22 - learning the code right and nobody
113:26 - anybody who says learning to code is
113:27 - easy is trying to tell you something
113:29 - like it is hard as heck it's getting
113:32 - easier every year it's we're not dealing
113:33 - with Punch Cards you know we're getting
113:34 - higher levels of abstraction it is
113:36 - becoming easier but it's not Star Trek
113:37 - easy where you just talk to the computer
113:39 - right uh eventually it will be but maybe
113:42 - in the 21th
113:44 - century the more immediate problem how
113:46 - helping people free up their time so
113:48 - they can actually learn I just want to
113:50 - commend you on this program like I love
113:54 - the idea of getting people out there
113:55 - doing real world work getting
113:57 - compensation through some sort of
113:59 - program where they can just I mean even
114:01 - $200 a week it sounds like it's going to
114:04 - be a huge Lifeline for a lot of these
114:05 - folks and free up a lot of time and
114:07 - energy um this is extremely exciting and
114:11 - I would be very excited to have you back
114:13 - on in the future catch up and like see
114:16 - what you learned from running this this
114:18 - new uh experiment that you're running
114:20 - this bold endeavor I'll let you know how
114:23 - it goes awesome man well it's been such
114:25 - a joy learning so much from you not just
114:29 - from this conversation but just you know
114:31 - following you on Twitter I'm going to
114:33 - add links to a lot of stuff that we'
114:35 - talked about in here I'm going to of
114:37 - course link to 100 devs and I just
114:40 - encourage people to learn more about the
114:42 - work of Leon learn more about uh 100
114:46 - devs resilient coders these
114:49 - organizations that uh you know like
114:51 - resilient coders is a charity like Freo
114:53 - Camp 51 C3 and um you know like there
114:57 - are lots of Charities out there that are
114:59 - doing important work I'm going to try to
115:02 - like uh encourage people to do what
115:05 - we've done the two of us and yes you can
115:07 - create a startup and make a lot of money
115:10 - and you know life-changing money
115:11 - especially if you've got like family
115:13 - that are back in a home country that
115:16 - that need support right or if you have
115:18 - like any number of different there I
115:20 - will never give people a hard time about
115:22 - just wanting to make a whole lot of
115:23 - money but if you have the means if you
115:26 - are somebody who's midcareer and wants
115:28 - to do something in the charity space I
115:31 - hope that uh the accomplishments of Leon
115:34 - and and modestly free Co camp and the
115:37 - pro like modestly there's no mod that
115:40 - needs to to be had there yeah yeah I I I
115:43 - hope some of this will inspire you to
115:44 - also consider you know doing work in the
115:47 - public space right as a tax exempt
115:49 - public charity uh and and again I just
115:52 - want to commend the work you're doing
115:54 - Leon and um I hope everybody has learned
115:56 - a great deal I appreciate it thank you
115:59 - so much like I said this is a a dream
116:01 - come true uh you've inspired me so much
116:04 - throughout my entire journey into this
116:06 - and uh I know you do the same for so
116:08 - many other folks each and every single
116:09 - day so thank you for the work that you
116:10 - do and uh and our communities right that
116:12 - that help push this stuff through yeah
116:14 - and and to everybody in the hund devs
116:16 - community that's watching this uh hang
116:19 - in there keep it up man there we go man
116:21 - and woman uh you all are doing a long
116:25 - grueling process but you're helping one
116:28 - another and you know you're making
116:30 - friends along the way so um with that I
116:33 - I just want to thank everybody for
116:35 - tuning in until next week happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

the welcome back to the free Coke Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larsson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people that are getting into Tech today we're talking with Leon Noel who I don't know if you've heard of 100 devs but it's amazing and it's a huge source of inspiration for me personally he is the founder of 100 devs and he head of engineering at resilient coders Leon joining us from Sunny Los Angeles how's everything going with you it's it's a little early we'll see if the sun comes out things are going well uh this is uh surreal experience thank you so much for having me and uh we we'll get weird with it real quick uh I I always joke that like my my wife knows how serious I am if your face is like the background of my like screens or or I've had a picture of you on my desk for a little while uh so she knows if it's go time or not based off of like she's seeing you so uh IM honor it's a huge privilege like this is a dream come true for me uh you're a huge hero of mine and have done so much to help so many folks and uh you're who I want to be when I grow up so I really appreciate it thanks for having me on yeah well I just want to say that it's like very kind uh and I want to say that that goes both ways like uh often when I'm feeling like a little but low energy and I just like ah you know I don't know if I can get a lot done today maybe I'll just you know go and answer a bunch of emails and not um do like curriculum design or or you know I'll I'll I'll go into like the I'm like what would Leon do he would dive in head first he would have so much energy overflowing and he would just go in there and get things done and so uh yeah like I I do think about you a lot when I'm just feeling low energy because I've watched your streams and I've seen the amount of energy both like literal energy like bursting forth and the positive energy that you bring to the community so uh thank you for that and uh I'll make a little meme of you know Wolverine holding the picture frame and then go holding holding the picture of me I won't really do that but like I when you said that that just fell hot in my mind because I love XMen so um Leon did did you see the new the new announcement 97 what's happened they're redoing the old school cartoon oh my goodness like post Professor X the original 9s Saturday morning all right no more everybody we stop the podcast we go watch the trailer it's really good it looks really good i i l link to the trailer in a little bit of tears in my eyes when there's a specific catchphrase that is said but yeah okay uh I'm going to link to that be sure to watch that immediately after you finish watching or listening to this podcast interview because we've got a ton of advice that's practical and not just you know something that you can do to escape from your daytoday experience but to build up your daytoday experience and accomplish your goals so Leon before we dive into 100 devs uh and Brazilian coders and all the work you've done uh I like to always start these interviews with more autobiographical stuff just so people can have context into like who you are your lived experience uh where you're coming from and where you're heading and things like that so maybe you could take us back to uh where you grew up and like what your earliest Ambitions were as a kid yeah so uh I grew up in Philly um definitely 100% a product of Philly I was always kind of the very kind of tinkering wanting to build type of kid uh I grew up with a a huge household a a big family uh all in one uh row home in South Philly which was amazing and uh I was blessed to have amazing libraries where I had access to computers and could tinker and build and uh I was very blessed even have a lot of even just Computer Science Education early throughout my life I had a q basic class in middle school where I would get a sailboat to go from one side of the screen to the other I thought it had magical powers and so I was very lucky to have these skills so so early uh we also in Philly have magnet schools which are kind of like EXA schools that you test into and so I went to engineering and science where I had two years of C++ in high school and this is like 20 years ago and so yeah I just I'm very lucky to have grown up in an environment that supported my passions and interest even when I didn't have access to those Technologies or knowledge that there was a way for me to get access to it so very very thankful for that that's awesome yeah that that's it sounds like a really kind of like adelic upbringing in the sense that like you've got access to what about teachers did you have any teachers as a kid who like really propelled you forward I always talk very passionately about my um my seventh grade teacher uh or eighth grade teacher uh science teacher Mr creger um whom I've failed to track down if you know Mr creger who taught at uh you know Hoover Middle School which was is is like a now destroyed bulldozed um School in Oklahoma City if anybody's heard of that person let me know but uh did you have anybody like a Mr creger in your life who was eccentric and interesting but kept giving you like interesting books about space and stuff like that yeah so i' I've have been lucky to have a few um so miss franchine was my fifth grade teacher that when I was done my coursework would not let me just sit there twiddling my thumbs but always had like puzzles and things to build and Tinker with in the background and likewise I've tried to find them I haven't been able to find them but they really kind of showed me that I could be in control of my learning that it wasn't a a oneway depositing of knowledge that I could have some sort of control or command over the things I was doing with my free time that would enable me to think creatively and and to do the things I wanted to do uh I had a lot of wonderful folks throughout High school that really helped guide me um that pushed me that uh maybe saw something inside of me that I didn't see inside of myself and would try and pull that out my we're talking about like code education Shout Out Mr shipper would uh push me to learn my my C++ and we had the old school like Matrix printers where you'd print out your code on them and and I would look through it and take it to them and try to point out bugs or errors and you talk about folks in your life that do like the small things right and Mr shipper every every birthday for years and years would just send me like a happy birthday message so talking about folks that just support you long term uh that was there and then in University it was Dr Bri esus the person that showed me that I could be what I wanted to be and supported my ability to learn supported what I wanted to do made sure that I had funding over the summer to like live uh made sure that I got to do the research I wanted to do and ultimately gave me the the skills that I thought I needed to be the person I wanted to be in life and so yeah definitely the product of amazing teachers throughout my entire life and definitely something that I try to think of with resilient coders and uh 100 devs like what what was about those folks that inspired me to to do more to learn to feel comfortable and try and bring that into the classroom as well yeah yeah it's so cool to talk with another teacher because obviously you're a software engineer but you're also a teacher to many many people not necessarily in the conventional way uh maybe in the conventional way too maybe you actually give lectures occasionally in person but like through 100 devs you're essentially like the classroom teacher that people need you know like yeah you know the the bat signals up in the air the the 100 Dev signal and and you're answering that call and you're helping people uh with the not just uh practical challenges of learning to code but the motivational challenges as well and that's that's a huge thing I take away from your Stream So sounds uh like you went on to do really well academically uh I presume because you went to one of the best universities in the world uh maybe you could talk a little bit about like what that process was like what what is it like getting into a relatively Elite cool and um you know like was that how long did you have that plan at what age did you kind of like Snap to awareness I always like to tell people like I kind of snapped to awareness much later in life uh I was maybe like 20 21 and that's when I like got really into like journalism and studying foreign languages and stuff like themes that would kind of run throughout the rest of my life living abroad and and and ultimately like much later I had kind of like a second thing where I learned like technology is really really gosh darn useful like and uh that's when I I learned to code and like automated stuff from my school and stuff but like did you have like an early kind of Awakening at some point do you remember a a distinct period of your life where you're like hey you know I can do a lot more than other people around me are doing my my peers was there such an Awakening for you yeah I think I I want it to be comfortable I wanted to have um a good life and I think early on especially as like a kid of color you're kind of taught this very it's just like Dr lur dentist it comes up over and over and over again and it comes from maybe our families and the folks in our community not knowing kind of all of the opportunities that are available but that those are the safe Pathways the Dr La dentist and so yeah for hundreds of years yeah hundreds years yeah so it's it's proven so that's kind of the path that I got put on as someone that who was successful pretty early academically I did well in elementary school I got I used to have to go from my school to another school every week to do like other programs and I saw how hard my grandparents had to work I saw how hard my grandfather worked specifically uh in a boiler room every day it was hot they were pulling Valves and I saw what Hardware could do and I wanted to do something that would enable me to have a good life but maybe not be so sweaty right and so the the that idea led me to look into Dr l dentist Dr l dentist and as I went through Middle School I was very focused on getting into one of our magnet schools so Philly has some amazing schools that you kind of test in and it's more of like a lottery now too as well and I went to engineering and science and engineering and science was geared around getting folks into engineering and Science and had tracks that you could follow and a really good placement rate into universities and so for a while my sophomore junior senior year pretty much every lunch period was spent with Miss Brown who's my guidance counselor and would make sure that I was getting access to everything I needed to do well academically and to get into really good schools and coming from a lowincome family it's really expensive so Miss Brown would U make sure that I had vouchers for everything that I could take the SAT for free that I could apply to schools for free that would get me into all the best summer programs that could help me academically I was a I did upper Bound for a while um made sure I had access to things that I didn't like calculators and things like that and so my school I owe a lot too in terms of getting me prepared um for eventually what I would go to is Yale and so for me I think I've just been really blessed to be the product of a school system that if I wanted it if I wanted to work hard if I wanted to put in the hours and I played three Sports I did every Club imaginable but I had really amazing people that guided me through that process and then uh was able to to make it from from ens into Yale and then um went into hard sciences and was on this track to be a a doctor right I I Dr La dentist I chose doctor uh my mom was uh uh an LPN and um I got to grow up in do offices and see and and talk to folks and that was kind of the path I was on and it's kind of funny because I was doing computer science I was in an engineering high school and I just didn't allow myself to see that as my path or my career even though that's where eventually I should have been or and eventually did make it to and so that's kind of the the long winding path into yeah awesome and LPN is licensed practitioner licensed practicing nurse yeah it's like a vocation nurse basically so instead of doing now I guess the track is like your bachelors and you get like your RN this was a vocational pathway okay to being a nurse yeah yeah yeah I just want to make sure I got that right and I have like this policy that like no matter how common the acronym is I always try to like spell it out uh for especially for our listeners abroad non native English speaker listeners as well um uh so okay so just recapitulate something that I've been taking detailed notice as you talk just because this is so so interesting and I um I'll email these to myself these are not for publiction but it's basically the contents of this conversation is public now so um it sounds like it you didn't it just didn't even click it didn't even really occur to you that software engineering was a field you could go into because like so many people coming from underprivileged backgrounds so many you know second generation immigrants or even first generation immigrants so many people growing up who are kind of still in the shadow of inequality like racial inequality that's systemic that is the reason one of the reasons why you know wealth among black families is like something like one/ tenth of like white families that have been in the US the same duration of time I mean it's like ridiculous but because of these circumstances uh you were pushed to do Dr lawyer dentist and again like most of my doctors dentists that I haven't had any lawyers that uh like over the years have been people who came from a different country like their parents came from a different country or the in many cases as doctors they literally came from like India past the US mle which is this incredibly stringent test ESS like recertified as doctors a very lengthy costly process uh just so they could practice in the US because the US is like you know a great place to live and it's a great place to work as a physician uh generally I I guess I shouldn't speak for all there may be some physicians in the audience to take issue with that because of regulatory you know issues and like all this other stuff but my point is you were so focused on that because that is what success sounded like uh that like that was like the family's perception of success and software engineer is like a relatively new thing that is you know not well understood and it's not a surprise because software engineering has only existed a few decades right yeah um maybe you could talk about like what that Awakening to software engineering was like and how you went about okay I'm GNA go much deeper on coding and learning about computer science and math like all these things that you need to be a successful software engineer um now now I you may take issue with me saying like you need a whole lot of math for example or something like that I don't think that's necessarily true for a lot of jobs but I I always tell people like there is no knowledge that is not power like you should definitely learn math if if you have the time it's probably not the highest priority if you just want to go get a job as a developer Sor right uh but my question for You Leon mathematics all right a complete introduction right on okay so uh I'm glad to hear that like yeah because a lot of times I hear like I think one of the pieces of misinformation that's going around is like oh you don't need math to be a developer like I don't know any math like I just took high school math and I'm a developer and like that is true to an extent but there is kind of like a ceiling that you're going to hit in your engineering career if you don't like at least take some time to learn some mathem matics and you can learn mathematics right here on Freo Camp's YouTube channel we have courses on pretty much every engineering math topic that you would learned at like an undergraduate engineering program so uh you know it's just investment of time and that's a big thing we'll talk about in a little bit is like isn't really free in the sense that you have to invest your time and energy and not everybody has equal time and energy some people have all kinds of different circumstances that inform their availability to learn the code yeah so we'll talk about that in a minute but like how did you approach this and like maybe how old were you were were you still in school when you realized that you wanted to do CS yeah so I was always building so when I started in sixth grade I learned Q basic and I would go to the libraries and tinker and build when I was in high school Upward Bound got me a TI 83 Plus calculator which I still have it's like in my drawer over here some where and you could write code for that calculator and I remember swapping I felt like it was like old school you know like how people used to swap floppies I would swap the games and programs from the calculator and go to the library and like I I remember the thing I wanted for one Christmas was like the cable that connected the the calculator to the computer so that I could like put my code on it and so uh I remember very early working on calculator games and other fun stuff that I just wanted to to bring into the world or modify and hack God and so that was always really fun and then I had that kind of formal C++ in high school and then when I got to University it all went out the window I was doing hard biology uh I was doing U eventually biological anthropology I was looking at hormones testas and stuff like that but this entire time I'd always been building tinkering I really liked entrepreneurship I was always trying to start ideas small companies uh things like that and I had started um one kind of simple project that went pretty viral in in New Haven New York area um and that kind of really showed me some of the power of these skills that I've been kind of accumulating but the real kind of Awakening for me for computer science was uh every summer I was doing lab work and I had figured out how to like survive uh when you're lowincome going into like an Ivy League school basically they give you a full ride right off the rip and so I had figured out that if I didn't live on campus they would give me like whatever the amount of money was to stay on campus they would give me and I was able to use that to like do stuff I would pay rent and food but I was happy eating pasta and pasta sauce and so I actually had money to like live and and do all the things that all my my fellow students were doing because i' had figured out this like way of doing it um but I ran out of money one summer and it was getting pretty dicey pretty quickly I I really didn't have any money for food left and I was literally hungry and I realized that I I could do things like I was looking up like quick jobs and then I was like wait a minute let me let me see if I can build somebody a website I know how to do it I've been building all these like landing pages and and small things with code before so I put on Craigslist hey I'll build you a site I can get it done today and somebody responded and they paid a deposit and my life changed from that moment I I skipped all the way to the grocery store I bought my pasta I bought my pasta sauce for the month I built them the site and in that moment something very clear happened in my brain that I had a real skill uh a skill that could provide that could put food on the table a skill that would make it so I was never [ __ ] hungry again sorry oops sorry chis uh it's cool again yeah if anybody like like we don't edit this podcast at all so I'm not going to edit out the square word that's like a unless there's like something really bad that happens like I had a coughing fit once and so that that changed everything um until this day I still freelance and I that's the reason why a lot of the things I do today the the resilient coders the 100 DS is like I want anybody that's ever felt that way to know that there is this option this ability to to develop skills that no one can take away from you that can put legitimate food on the table and so that's when I kind of went all in on more of the engineering piece awesome yeah well um that sounds like an amazing discovery of like powers that you just had Laten within you that necessity brought forth you know necessity is the mother of invention right uh you were forced to basically by your circumstance to like think outside the proverbial box come up with a way to to get money to buy your pasta um I you know I definitely uh remember the lean College here is subsisting off pasta we got the smack Ramen if anybody like not the good like sh ramun like Korean Ramen but like it was just called smack we'd always joke about it like when you're hungry enough it's almost like you know like a drug because it's just like you feel so sated afterward course like terrible for you but what kind of pasta did you always just like did you have a particular like build of pasta that you liked uh I this is like way back whatever the cheapest was I was I was trying to survive I didn't care nowadays I probably have some preferences but back then whatever whatever was on sale whatever is the cheapest uh there was the supermarket nearest had like this like clearance aisle and in that clearance aisle they would put like the stuff they couldn't sell and so whatever was on that that rack is what I I would grab yeah yeah uh and and to this day by the way like a lot of grocery stores like Walmart like they'll take their baked goods and they'll put them on a rack like right by the like exit like the staff only place where they have like the garbage compactor where they compact the boxes like I I worked in a grocery stores for a few years so basically back where they keep all the mops and they keep all the you know inventory shelves there will be like a little rack and sometimes they'll have baked goods they're like it's still good but we can't really sell it because it's going to expire in like a day or two so like I sto snacks and Bargains from there uh but but yeah just Pro tip if you're going to a US uh grocery store you can often find like food that's about to expire that you can get like at a heavy discount so um that's really cool so how did things unfold from there so how did you um how did you go from that first contract work essentially that that client that you landed through Craigslist which is how I land I think I landed some early clients through Craigslist Craigslist amazing tool I'm not sure if it's still amazing today like 12 years since I last used it but yeah uh yeah like a lot of early G were found on Craigslist how did you go from that to the deciding I am a Dev like taking that identity if you will and going deeper with it yeah sure so um my junior year at Yale I started a small website called List full of hope it was kind of like a reverse Craigslist where uh if you needed something you could say what you needed so if you needed a jacket and someone in the area had a jacket jacket you would meet up and they would give you a jacket so it was kind of like a gift economy um it was very simple site that was just enabling folks to help others in their community and it really kind of popped off in New Haven and so there was the one winter where it was like really popular I remember people getting Christmas presents jackets gloves anything you needed um and I could really see that transition from something that was like just a raw skill to like me having to build an actual application and having real users and I was hooked like I could I saw the power I saw that it could help so many people and I knew that these skills would be really advantageous to keep going so my junior year I kind of slowly stopped kind of really wanting to do coursework senior year it became an even bigger problem and I was trying to finish my thesis to to graduate and I had to get like 300 men to spit in a tube tell me about their sexual history so I could correlate it to their testosterone levels I was trying to like show that um or find something about BPA and relation to testosterone so you drank a lot of like plastic water bottles yeah and so I was trying to do that before before it became really popular like something people would actually think about free plastic which for the kids like just in case D does have like deleterious effects we don't want our kids to be drinking from so I was having a really hard time running that that experiment and uh apparently people didn't want to you know spit in a tube and tell me about their sexual history for like a bottle of Gatorade and like a pack of gum or something and so uh I wasn't able to recruit enough people for that experiment and I decided to use my like coding skills to set up it was just like a landing page where a lot of students were always trying to find studies or experiments to participate in because one they were a lot of fun sometimes and you actually got paid pretty well to do the experiments and so there is one really famous One that people loved where you basically went to a lab they got you drunk and you played poker and they're just like watching you like how you make risky decisions and things like that and you got paid a couple hundred dollars to do it wow and so I made a landing page that had all the studies from Yale Harvard Princeton that were like trying to get people to come and I just slipped mine in there and it took off because we had all these professors that were promoting it we had all these students that got real value they went to the site they found something fun to do they got money and and um I dropped out my senior year to turn that into a business um which became social sigh and um we wound up building academic surveying tools we had over 4,000 different universities that used our tools to power their academic research uh and even though that company has been wrapped up for a long time now we still have research that gets published based off of the data that they collected I needed to know more my Engineers had these like magical powers and I needed to to like learn that skill for myself and so I took my coding education more seriously uh eventually uh I was building other products other startups as well and and started teaching at General Assembly helping others kind of acquire these skills too so that was kind of the the journey it's interesting so first of all congratulations on building something that 4,000 universities use it's not easy to get universities to use your stuff like there's like this notorious like sales cycle adoption cycle among universities they're they're very like slow to adopt new tools um yeah I mean that's that's phenomenal to go from basically like Mechanical Turk for being a human test subject to having like an actual project that is getting wide usage like that that's really funny that you bring up Mechanical Turk that was the reason why we were able to raise like VC funding was because M Turk was becoming more popular um and what social size saw was not just the the survey creation but the participants taking the surveys and so part of my pitch deck and I'll never forget it was I decided to get my mom a Christmas card and I had people on mtk like just like hold up like the the merry Christmas sign and what we had was this one person with a hundred different like not 100 but like a lot of different accounts that was just like Chang ing their hat putting on a different shirt but it was like clearly the same person and so at this point Mechanical Turk hadn't solved the like identity online and like how do you stop like false participants and that was kind of why we were able to be um able to raise money and why we were able to have so many universities trust and use our service because we were solving that problem specifically so was your mom like who is this person and why are they so you know passionate about like wishing me a happy birthday it was cool there was like 100 people from all over the world with like different backgrounds different cities different places and they all were saying Merry Christmas now you could probably facilitate that but back when we did it it was yeah it was pretty cool yeah and mechanical turque just for people that are unfamiliar with it is like they call it artificial artificial intelligence obviously nowadays like a lot of things you would pay someone on mechanical TK to do you just like form out to like an llm or something but it was like um like hey I need you like early on it was like hey I need you to solve a capture for me or hey I need you to create a Facebook account and like like this this Facebook group or something like that was like basically getting around the restrictions that different like platforms might have in place uh but uh event but you know in the good like as designed use would be for example getting people to do precisely what Leon said so uh it was everybody would get like maybe just like a few pennies for doing a a hit I think or job or something I can't remember what they were called but uh yeah you you would do those is that accurate like I haven't actually used it yeah no that that's that's pretty close uh there was it's this whole subfield called human computation right so human computation there's there's some things that computers can't yet do that humans can still do but figuring out how to do them at scale um is really important and so Mechanical Turk you can take an a task break it down into a very small subtask and have thousands and thousands of people do it need for human computation is like labeling data think of like AI training and things like that who were the people like there had to be real people that said that was a a fired hose or that was a car or that was a bicycle that's a Chihuahua and not a muffin exactly that's like a famous like chihuahuas look a lot like muffins to a computer and so figuring out all of that was necessary for a lot of the advancements that we're seeing now and there are still things that humans can do very quickly that machines just can't do yet and so um M Turk still has like a place um there are other companies that do similar things nowadays of course but that labeling and small tasks done at scale and there are other cool things you can do too so where it's like um instead of giving it to just one person you give it to five and if four out of the five do one thing you know that you can probably trust that thing as opposed to the one person that did it as opposed to The Minority Report yeah the dissenting uh the asentic opinion yeah that that's a good kind of consensus mechanism so um Okay cool so you built this project we could talk about that a lot more but we have so much more to talk about like where do you go from there you you basically had a successful project right like everybody's dream especially at this point sounds like you were pretty young like yeah like had you finished college at this point like I I so I dropped out and never finished um oh wow and my senior year at Yale um I had this idea for social sigh I dropped out I did Tech Stars um techar is an accelerator popular like they they give you some some seed money and then you're in like a program where they kind of Coach you exactly they help you yeah exactly they help you lay the foundation for a company and all the skills you might need to know to to do that effectively uh techstars really changed my life it really gave me a lot of the skills that I was missing um gave me my initial Network outside of University and yeah initial seed funding and then helped me going to raise more funds for for social sigh and yeah while I was running social sigh I started teaching uh a general assembly and so general assembly is one of the first like really big uh coding boot camp programs and I was doing their parttime courses for a very long time I'm distinguished faculty with uh GA even until today and I was having just hundreds if not thousands of people be successful like learning these new skills learning how to code getting great jobs and at one point it kind of just got overwhelming that I didn't notice anyone that looked like me taking advantage of this program one because it cost a lot of money it also cost a lot of time um and so I started looking for orgs uh near me in Boston that I could help or support and I came across resilient coders which at that time our founder David delmare I was really trying to work with court involved Youth and show them that hey like there are these things you could be doing like coding or things like that that might help you longterm in life and so I started just going to we had what are called Community hours where it was just myself a few other mentors and a bunch of young folks that um were typically court involved or or a returning Citizen and just trying to like give them these skills and then um we had the idea of starting a boot camp and uh our founder dve dmar said hey like you've been running these other boot camp programs could you do it for RC said yes and then for the past six years we've built a program that can help folks uh traditionally of color that have um particularly not completed a degree go from zero to employable as a soft engineer and we've been pretty successful at it we've helped hundreds of folks get jobs um and with starting salaries around $992,000 and for us that's huge because for each person we can get from those communities we're talking about millions and millions of dollars back into those communities over the lifespan of their career so started doing uh resilient coders that eventually led me to 100 devs and that's kind of the the Long Way Forward I want to dive a little more into because we're going to talk a lot about 100 devs but like uh Brazilian coders you you said uh court involved youth uh I'm I'm not familiar with term but like you know I have lots of friends who are like convicted felons and I'm not sure if that if that is essentially like people who early on in life uh get into trouble maybe because they actually did something wrong or maybe they were profiled in like the the very unequal justice system in the United States didn't do its job very well and and you know gave them much harsher penalty than that kid should probably have in many cases uh but uh is that like accurate is like yeah so we had a lot of individuals that we say court involved because exactly of the things that you brought up a lot of the folks that we were working with they didn't do anything wrong uh and they were just at the wrong place the wrong time um we did have folks that um had gone down a different path in life to do the things they needed to do provide for themselves and their families and so we wanted to give them a clear path forward to do the the thing with their loved ones and so we trying to get them skills just skills that they could put into practice to to to get to a point to where they had a a strong stable high growth career and and that's that's kind of the birth of RC and our our our Dirty Little Secret that um I guess some folks know is that the first dollars we ever took in were from the Boston Police Department uh because they saw our program as hey we're going to spend all this money on incarceration Rehabilitation um why not get ahead of it and they gave us some funding to help run our first boot camp yeah that's awesome well it sounds like it was money well spent uh given the uh impact you all have had over the past six years I think you said um so so you got resilient coders going you're teaching there um and there it sounds like you're having a big impact but was there a moment where you're like I can have an even bigger impact by leveraging the power of the internet like what was the process that and and maybe I can back up a second and just say what is 100 devs yeah sure uh so 100 devs is a collection of Engineers that help build a completely free live software engineering training program for anyone anywhere uh that was kind of our our Genesis now we're also building and we're going to be piloting this year a full service digital agency where real clients come to us to build products and get to tap into our amazing alumni that have gone on to work at some of the best tech companies in the world we're talking Amazon LinkedIn slack You Name It We have an alumni there they come back to work on these projects uh each Project's getting broken down in individual tasks and then as you're learning you're also building real code for real companies and getting paid actual money to do it um we mentioned early on that free isn't always free because it requires you to have an extreme privilege of time to work through all this material to give up your nights and weekends and we want to do something that helps soften the blow for folks that are going through our program so our program is entirely free uh every resource I have ever given out is always free I don't work with anybody that doesn't have a free version or something that we can have access to but we did a poll not too long ago that said hey we realize a lot of you uh care can't commit the time or the the take the time away from putting food on the table what would it what would it take for you to be able to focus and it was $200 a week was the was the average we can make that happen we can figure out a way to get folks those fund so that they can focus and get through a program like a 100 devs and yeah so now we're a global Community our Discord is 60,000 plus strong uh we have alumni all around the world and we're just trying to figure out a way uh for folks to be able to unlock a stable high growth career put food on the table support themselves and their family and their loved ones and luckily we found a lot of folks that believe in that idea and Mission to and we build a wonderful Community around it yeah and uh so the mechanics of the community like first of all it goes without saying that I'm in awe of what you all are accomplishing with hund devs and uh I've had so many positive interactions with people who are both like the free Cod Camp curriculum and in the 100 devs I guess you call it like a cohort or an intake or like basically a bunch of people working together through a set kind of like week to week um program and I you know free Cod camp we have experimented with like cohorted programs and like let's see if we can get all these people uh but what we found is like it's it's a lot of work to organize which I'm sure you're very aware of and like free COC philosophy is like let's just build the resources at scale put them out there yes lots of kids who are the you know the son or daughter of like software engineers in poo Alto are going to use free Cod camp and they're going to use it for free and they you know probably could have paid a bunch of money to have a computer science student like tutor them or something right but also a whole lot of kids who are in like a village in rural India or uh in like kind of like a failed State uh which a lot of people have smartphones and can't get on the internet even in places like Somalia right uh North Korea right people in North Korea use freeo Camp sometimes that's wild and uh essentially they can they can learn even though uh it would be normally prohibitively expensive for them to buy you know a $20 course on like a course website uh for example and and so like our philosophy is like we need to make sure that there is a baseline that everybody has access to comprehensive math programming computer science and English education um so that everybody regardless of their circumstances if they have time which not everybody does but if they have time or they can figure out techniques to like make time yeah to learn even a little each day then they can make steady forward progress toward the eventual goal of working as a software engineer right uh so so that is kind of like our philosophy is like let's just make tons of really high quality free stuff that's essentially subsidized by the community like the the people who are able to give the alumni um sometimes like we got a gift for $250,000 the other day from comp saw CEO of coma is a fan of free Cod camp and uses free Cod Camp to expand his JavaScript knowledge super chill dude uh you know we darl silver uh founder of thinkful uh kicked in $150,000 um and then of course we're getting grants from like you know Linux foundation and mongodb and Google and a lot of other organizations but a vast majority of our support comes directly from the community from people who donate so rec.org donate all right but but my point is oh yeah and thank you thank you for supporting our charity uh Le I didn't even realize I apologize um but maybe you're getting my my periodic donor uh email like I said yeah so um my point in all all this little tangent is to say that like free C Camp like we don't have the bandwidth to do things that don't scale and you are doing things that don't scale at all really like maybe you figured out some techniques to get like cohorts to scale and get like because I mean you mentioned your Discord has 60,000 people in it uh but like actually getting on stream and like teaching for like a marathon 3 five hours like however long you go it's really inspiring uh definitely catch some of the live streams if you can or I've watched I I watch everything at Double speed so I watch like the video on demand Stu like that but uh like I guess you saw from coming from the like intensive program where you're teaching folks like you saw the Merit of quality not just quantity or like I guess like cont like I'm not like doing things that don't scale really uh and and helping in people individually uh doesn't really scale but that's not necessarily the idea the idea is to give a whole lot of attention to a a smaller number of people and to really make sure that those people can ramp up to you know an impressive he said like uh what was the uh the figure you said was like the the median income of people who graduated um 92,000 yeah for cters yeah that's a lot more than I made at my first developer job given if this is in Boston like the cost of living might be higher but but I mean that's a that's a lot of freaking money for people that like I I imagine some of these people don't have University degrees I didn't even know that you hadn't completed your degree although dropping out of Yale is probably very different from dropping out of like you know rather University right yeah but uh sorry I've been talking for the last three minutes I'm just very excited about how you approach this and I I want to make sure our audience appreciates the I guess counterintuitiveness of what you've done uh and how you've been able like people weren't doing this because it was perhaps counterintuitive to do so and it was like probably very idea don't yeah so so like maybe you can talk about that like how you have to do stuff that doesn't scale and like ways that it doesn't scale and then ways like techniques you figured out to scale it a little bit sure yeah happy to I think the first thing though is just like Shout Out free code camp like you all laid the the foundation for so many folks to learn and one of the things I'm always hyping uh especially in 100 devs on our Discord is I think a lot of folks that go into this space don't put in the work to do the things that really matter the most and so one of the things I've always admired about free code Camp is like this commitment to filling the gaps and so realizing that most people don't have the privilege of speaking English so we're going to build a full like how do you speak English course right uh that's that's huge it's like very progressively thinking about what do our folks going through our program absolutely need and so um that's why I'm so happy that free code Camp exists it's why it's one of the first things I always recommend to new folks getting into Tech and why like I I think you all will continue to be so successful cuz it's just like this Relentless pursuit of making Tech more Equitable to everyone and so um that's why I said really early on in this conversation I look up to you so much and it's a lot of that ethos is what I've tried to bring to 100 devs um for 400 devs we got started during the pandemic and the pandemic hit and things got really bad really quickly so people always like to talk in Boston about at 2% unemployment rate but I knew just from looking at the actual data when you looked in our communities of color is already at 12% this is pre pandemic if you look during the pandemic it jumped from 12 to like 33% in some communities and so it got real bad real quick and I I just if you are already in Tech or if you already come from a privilege background I don't think people really understand what that means when right now like if you look at the most recent like labor data like the the median income come median median is 56,000 in the US and so if we have that percent of folks under it and we're seeing 33% unemployment and then labor data actually includes like eligible workers it just got real bad real quick and it continues to be a really rough situation from folks and so I'm not a doctor uh I didn't have like a skill that I thought that could be helpful to folks that were being affected by the pandemic but I had been teaching for a while and I knew that I could get folks uh skills to make them more employable and so 100 devs started as a way of getting 100 folks into software engineering jobs we're way beyond that now and I wanted to make a live cohort where we would meet twice a week on the internet and I really thought it would be like you said just a handful of folks maybe five 10 people um we did a pilot that was really successful our first cohort was about 300 people every single class that was successful we did another cohort that was like 3,000 people every single live every single class and so we kind of just built slowly we we we were able to kind of jump from Zer to 300 300 to 3,000 and we always joke that we're baddies we're like we're we're baddies writing bad code like it doesn't matter uh it's about getting the skills that we need it's about figuring out things on the Fly um and we just live up to being kind always to ourselves to others and as long as you're willing to say you know what we got to figure this out we got to figure out how do we do this at scale how do we have 3,000 people live in a class getting help and not feeling lost um we had to figure systems and ways of doing that and um building community that wanted to support that number of folks awesome what you said there first like I just want to call it that that particular Insight we're baddies writing bad code it doesn't matter so when I was a you know a teenager like uh really interested in like writing and reading lots of you know fiction and Jour like literary journalism and stuff like that um I I would always hang out at Denny's like till 2 amm just talking to random people and learning from them and just writing and stuff and uh one time like our our server he he was kind of a grizzled old looking dude like he would he would not look at a place in like a bullpen in a newspaper Newsroom if such thing even exist in 2024 but uh but his advice to me was I'll never never forget what he said he he said throw away your first million words and I was love that damn a million words that's like years of writing uh but just accept that it's gonna suck and the same thing with your your code projects and really the same with any Endeavor you you take like I've been trying to get better at Bass for the past three or four years and like takes me forever to record the bass intros for like I thought you like the one of the videos I watched you did it and then sat down so that's what I was I'm telling you that's what I was expecting for for today so I'm a little sad that I didn't get the bass intro live just for me but I didn't want to bother you with like watching me screwed up several times I love it but but yeah like like you just have to accept that the first few thousand hours you spend with an instrument or with like a programming language or with anything is going to be not ready for prime time uh you know my wife uh she grew up in China we met in grad school and she's now a US citizen we we brought her over and naturalized her after grad school after we got married we've been married 19 years and um she she loved playing piano right and one of the things that she says in China like people take piano extremely seriously and they have the saying in Chinese which is basically like you spend thousands of hours um behind the stage practicing for you know five minutes on the stage you know like that's just the nature of the game and with code like if you're writing some serious system that's going to like code that's going to be run millions of times right like if you're making an open source contribution to free Cod camps codebase and it's in the platform itself and this component is going to be rendered 50,000 times a day or something like that like it's it's okay that it took you a whole lot of work to get that like code into the shape and it's okay that it took a lot of practice and trial and error before you got the skills to be able to create that code that code just going to keep going right like you know uh when Elvis goes up on the stage and he's being filmed uh and he's playing I use Elvis because I love Elvis I'm sure he's overrated or whatever but he he's he's the man so I mean like that guy practiced like crazy that's definitely the same with uh for example like James Jamerson the greatest basist of all time basically uh or um you know like pretty much any musician they're going to practice just like crazy they're going to rehearse obsessively and they're not going to be satisfied but once that recording is made once that record is cut if you if you uh there's this great um documentary about fonus monk uh the jazz pianist right and he would only do like two takes and he he's just like after two takes whatever I do is going to be garbage I'm done like use one of those takes but how it got how he got so good that he could actually nail it in one or two takes was he practiced like a maniac and he spent so much time at the piano uh where a lot of you know uh I guess amateurs would would just be like good enough he was not content with that and so I feel the same way about like any undertaking but but like certainly with coding it may seem like coding is not like a synchronous performative event like where you're having to sit down and perform in that regard you can go and you can edit your code you can iterate on it the tools have gotten so much better like free C Camp every millisecond or two you're going to get the tests like telling you whether you met all the test conditions or whether you need to keep tweaking your code right so you have all these tools to iterate but at the end of the day like you should still try to approach it like a performance you'll get a lot better if you don't rely so much on the tools catching uh what you're doing but anyway I'm kind of going on a tangent but I just wanted to to Riff on like the Insight that it is we're all baddies yeah we're writing bad Cod it doesn't matter because you throw away your first million words you spend thousands of hours at the piano before you're playing anything that's worth anybody listening to right like you just have to accept that this is the nature of reality this is the nature of doing anything that's hard is it's going to be hard you're going to have to work hard and you have to just have that mental fortitude and and that's something that comes through in your your video is like it's so supportive like I love the way that you're just like it's all good like just this happens to everybody everybody has to go through this you know I always like to say like there some people may be like slightly better at programming like aptitude wise or or like they may have some intrinsic like Quirk that makes them marginally better at programming but those people were probably just forgotten how much time they spent at the keyboard when they were a kid if they were privileged enough to grow up with computers right like uh you know when you hear like Bill Gates talk about how like oh I don't actually like write out the code until I figured everything out in my head and then I said that's nonsense Bill Gates did not just sit down and like write basic from memory because he'd like been moving everything around his head people can't do that I don't believe that that maybe there are some people that have like some extreme form of like like like extreme brains they could do something like that but I don't believe that Bill Gates could do that sort of stuff I think he's just talking up the Mythos you know he he's trying to build up hype for himself and like it's this old kind of like Old School elitism uh that a lot of the early devs the Old Guard have and uh just just don't buy that hype is is all I want to say and and I want to thank you for like dispelling a lot of that whether you're intentionally dispelling it or not just telling people like coding is right like not not sugar coating it we call it the trough of Sorrow which actually comes from like startup worlds is one of the things there's this very classic graph of like um this like really big hill that you go up when you're really excited about something like I'm going to learn the code you buy a thousand Demi courses because buying stuff feels good even though you're not going to do them and you at the very top and then you start like day one of any actual coding program and then you just Plum it once you realize how long it's going to take and then you spend all that time going through the trough of sorrow and then the most like sick thing about this is that I shouldn't say that but the the most Twisted thing about this is at the very end there's an even further dip that you have to go through uh where you it's the and then you get into what we call the Wiggles of false hope so even after you've gone through you've learned everything you needed to learn you start actually interviewing to get the job and you're just getting rejected rejected rejected and so there's just this huge curve long trough of Sorrow uh that for a lot of folks takes years to get through then once you get to the end where you're like trying to actually get something out of it it gets even worse and then slowly slowly gets better so I think the big thing for what we do like you mentioned at 100 devs is just helping folks manage that frustration we kind of have like three key things that we just say every class almost manage your frustration be consistent and take care of yourself when you look at how adults learn the reason why adults kind of probably don't learn is as well as they think they could is because they don't manage that frustration piece when they looked at language fluency and like language acquisition they thought that we probably lost the ability to be fluent in our teenage years but they found that that probably isn't true it's just once you get out of those years your time is entirely your own and so would you rather do this thing that sucks for two years or would you actually uh sit down and do it and so if folks that can manage that frustration to actually be get through the things they want to do and so that's a big part and it's also why we're live uh when you look at other programs I love uh Dr M out of Harvard cs50 I love that cs50 is now on on free cam I've read every single article they've ever put out and one of the ones that are really interesting is they actually published all of their data for cs50 in the beginning uh which was really cool to read through and you you notice that they had like 150,000 people that signed up for like the they're up and they'll help you get back up right so you help one another so that that's kind of the genius of 100 Dev so maybe you can talk a little about the mechanics of it obviously you've got the Discord you've got the twice weekly um streams when classes in session so to speak uh and and they are high energy streams man I just have to compliment like the you got like the like all these sound effects like the cool astronaut background and stuff it's like watching uh like a gamer on Twitch like like watching somebody playing like you know csgo at a high level or something but it it's education right like and in my mind like you're pioneering kind of a new approach to education that is based off of like people are already familiar with like games and Anime and all these other cultural kind of touchstones and you're just like hey let's let's relate this to software engineering right and so you're doing a great job of that but maybe you can talk about in addition to the stream in addition to the Discord what are the other aspects of 100 devs what are the other uh instruments sure so we do a live cohort model we basically do a cohort a year and when that cohort is live we're live on Twitch twice a week uh for about three hours for a class we take about an hour to do review space repetition active recall is super important uh so we spend that first hour just like reviewing and then about two hours of something new we do that twice a week and then we have office hours on Sunday which is another stream typically on Twitch or on Discord um but it's just people asking questions and getting things answered outside of that there are so many other expectations and things that you're working on that's about 10 to 20 hours outside of that twice a week class networking all the things are going to actually move the needle for you to get a job our our our joke is that we're not really a coding program we're getting a job program and so all the things you have to be doing to get a job have to be happening when we're not live then for folks that can't participate in a live experience we have our lustrious catchup crew which is a group of folks that are working through the classes at maybe a little bit more of their own pace we have a lot of folks that are around the world that can't make that live time work for them so they get together they're on our Discord working through the classes together you'll often see like 20 people just in a voice Channel watching a class together um that they've just they've come together to do uh and so you can move through the material at your own pace uh when we're outside of a cohort like right now now we have we have our huddles twice a week and the huddles are just like a traditional standup we're just trying to move away from that I I think it's a slightly ableist term so we interest them as as huddles and yeah that makes sense I've never thought about stand up as an ableist term but it is a lot of people can't stand up and so we we'll have anywhere from like 500 to 700 people every huddle just asking questions sharing we call the the job hunt the hunt sharing what's happening on the hunt uh how while they are negotiating they'll come up live we'll help them negotiate offers they'll talk about uh an interview that W great or poorly and just by showing up to these huddles you're learning all these like it's so hard to go through life with everything that you're experiencing being the first time you've experienced it it doesn't have to be that way specifically with when you have a community that's also doing it so the huddles are our way to expose people to the realities of getting a job going and interviewing and and and actually seeing all this knowledge and so that when you're in that situation uh you can experience it too so we have the huddles twice a week and then we have a lot of independently generated Community things so um we have Banky brunch shout out Banky brunch which is a group of folks that come together to work through behavioral questions technical questions pretty much every single day uh we have groups that are working on projects our voice channels are always going and uh none of this works without community and a wonderful group of mods uh i' be remiss to not say Miriam dier Mayan wolf Claire uh these folks that like blah that make like all this work um and for free and volunteering so much of their life to like make this happen amazing yeah like free Co Camp similarly to draw parallels to our organization very Community Driven like we have tons of mods on the Forum on Discord we have open source contributors that are just dropping in and like fixing little bugs making sure that like our copy is as readable as possible to nonnative English speakers making sure that like you it's a lot of contributor driven activity and it sounds like you've figured out a way to encourage a lot of people in your community Empower them with like you know you can delegate uh some degree of uh I guess authority to them so that they can go out and they can just experiment and build out different things one of the things that you said uh that I thought was really interesting uh I do want to talk about let's just talk about space repetition and active recall I believe are the terms sure uh Barbara Oakley teaches the how to learn course the most popular moo massive open online course ever other than maybe like cs50 which we were talking about earlier uh learning how to learn it's not just obvious how to learn there tactics right there there are phenomena uh in that are ingrained in the human brain from you know Evol tion from like the you know savanas of Africa basically that we carry with us today uh that that we can use if we know how to use them and one of them you mentioned is space repetition what what is space repetition yeah sure so I I guess kind of to set the stage real quick is that a lot of folks that attempt to learn how to code are not successful we know that we know the drop offs we know that that's just a reality and a lot of time those people feel like that it is them that it's a they they do not have the ability to learn how to codee they do not have there's something about them that would stop them from being successful as a software engineer and as someone that's worked with thousands of people like literally in the classroom my finger is on their keyboard I just know fundamentally my heart of hearts like a outside of a a cognitive impairment that's just not true and the thing that I found is it's just that most people don't know how to learn and it's it's almost criminal that our school system doesn't actually teach us how to learn that every textbook doesn't have some very fundamental things at the beginning uh that help you remember and learn this material so the difficult thing about software engineering is that it's a cumulative career the things you learn this week you're might need two years from now and so there are two like really fundamental learning techniques that Dr Barbara Oakley does walk through that I really it's my favorite one of my favorite courses of all time uh brings up uh where as humans we forget stuff very quickly so if I gave you a threeletter code this is called the evos curve it's it was a study of one it's somewhat been replicated since then but basically this person just tracked a new threeletter word a threeletter code every day and they found within the first like 30 minutes there was a 20% chance they just forgotten it the first 30 minutes so imagine trying to learn this really complicated coding stuff and within the first 3 minutes you're going to forget it then if you look at that forgetting curve by the end of the month there's an 80% chance that you have forgotten that very simple thing and so for a lot of folks that are going into coding education they just don't realize that the forgetting curve is very steep they they'll learn something a month later they've completely forgotten and they start back over and that's super frustrating so space repetition is using a tool that makes the material come back to you when you need it most and so uh a typical tool for this is anky or Anki however you want to call it that's like it means to commit to memory in Japanese aod exactly and so it is a flashcard tool that has an algorithm behind it so that surfaces the information when you need to see it so if you're doing good study habits which is a huge portion of what we teach at 100 devs it's just like how to study you're using this tool so that the things you learned about HTML you're not forgetting when we're talking about like mongod DP right and so that space repetition is going to help you remember stuff for the long call which is really important for a cumulative career but then the other thing that's even more important in my opinion than space repetition is something called active recall coding can be done through like video tutorials it can be done through text but it's a lot of information the process and most people just go through it that's not active learning they they feel maybe some sort of productivity from having watched tutorial or having read a blog post but they didn't actually engage with that material or learn and a lot of times like for me I teleport through information like if I'm reading a book I'll get through three paragraphs and I'm like what the heck just happened I feel like I've just teleported through that T through I haven't heard that expression but that's a good way to describe the phenomenon especially you know people who have like ADHD and stuff they may just be like halfway through a you know a book maybe I don't know like you just your mind wanders and uh if you're not constantly kind of trying to engage with it you won't necessarily retain so active recall is the way that that helps me as someone that does have ADHD like do this and so active recall is just recalling the things that you just learned or just read or just watched and for folks that do have attention issues I recommend doing that after each paragraph uh I recommend doing after each chapter end and you're just literally talking to yourself what did I I just read what did I just learn and you're saying it out loud the research behind it is really shocking like staggering differences uh you can learn something once actively recall it once and do better than somebody that reread it four times yeah like you can do a quarter of the effort and have better results just with this one technique and the fact that that's not like stamped in every single textbook ever made is is absurd yeah it it's I mean like we could talk all day about like the shortcomings of the US uh uh education syst like both both uh K through2 and HED and be completely clear there are a lot of very smart people who are working very hard to address a lot of these deficiencies but but the fact that we're having to explain what active recall and uh you know space repetition are when they are you know like time tested phenomena that you can leverage so just a quick note about active recall this is one of the reasons why freeo Camp's entire curriculum is interactive it's because you have to Grapple with things otherwise it's just it could have just blown right past you right like y everything needs some sort of evaluation criteria some sort of comprehension check and if you're doing something that doesn't have comprehension check if there's not some right or wrong answer taking a moment to summarize what you just learned or relate it to something else you've learned think thinking about it just grappling with it that that can absolutely help cement those you know synapses right like what's the thing that connects synapse Axion not Axion dendrites I can't remember it is you probably know but uh but yeah like and it's something anybody can do like when I when I'm uh you know reading a news article or something like that right that's not interactive now with GPT or something I could throw I could throw it in GPT and say like hey come up with like a multiple choice question based off this article and I'll do that sometimes uh and not not just for like active recall but space repetition like write a bunch of notes and then review them a few days later or use a tool like eny that can systematically do that where you can like load a bunch of flash cards s a lot of learning platforms have spaced repetition just built into them if you go through the free Cod Camp curriculum it's designed in such a way that we're going to reintroduce Concepts over and over and you're going to be like oh yeah I kind of remember this from like a few hours ago you know it's like or a few days ago like but but we're intentionally trying to you know incorporate that and one of the things I think talking about the free codame curriculum let's talk about 100 devs and like what you all are and is it 100 devs or 100 devs I you say either 100 Dev I just I couldn't remember I say 100 devs 100 devs is shorter yeah it sounds more uh more like easy to say so yeah with 100 devs like what is the coursework that you're going through like are are you using mukes are you using open textbooks are you creating a lot of the stuff yourself how are you do yeah so I think there's like two important things one I really don't believe the content matters it's all the other like we're we're jobs program and I think I think one the biggest mistakes people make is like an over an investment and the idea that the thing like that the learning aspect and not all the other things that move the needle so we're very much two kind of tracks like we have all this other stuff we're doing outside of the learning and then the learning as well so the learning is is very simple um we do full stack JavaScript and I do a lot of like custom like I make all the lectures basically with the slides and all the the funny stuff that you mentioned on Twitch and we we move through that material together but a lot of a lot of it is supplementing with other things that I think are just the best free courses out there so in the beginning our students will use some free code cab um as they get a little bit further along they'll they'll use um some things maybe from Full stack open um that are trying to supplement the things that we're doing in the classroom and anytime that's we're doing something it's always a free resource it always has a free trial or not a trial like a free level of access yeah um and so we we give you the skills to be a full stack web devel developer we do some of the other kind of rounding out to give you the software engineering skill set um the tooling and things that you might use and then uh as you're getting ready to go on the hunt the data structures and algorithms you're going to need to be successful um but that's kind of like the coding stuff outside of that from the very beginning there's pretty stringent requirements in terms of like your networking so you are supposed to be getting three connections and two coffee chats every single week uh throughout program you're doing things that are going to be opening all these doors to help you get a job and um that's kind of another really I think that's where our curriculum shines is those things that are really helpful and impactful for helping you get a job we actually have a lot of folks that do other boot camps which we love like like I don't really care where you come from what you do as long as like you're getting to where you want to go and a lot of folks will join us just for like the how to get a job portion which I think we're pretty strong at awesome so it it's so interesting and important that you distinguish yourself as like a not a learn coding program but a Get a Job Program uh and I just want to emphasize like like even though we put a great deal of time and energy into our curriculum it's AB absolutely like if you took it like look at where all the donations we get and things like that go toward its instructional design platform development mainly for the Core Curriculum uh because for us it is important that there's a really good Core Curriculum but I'll be the first to tell you or I guess the second since Leon just said it getting a job as a developer is really three things in my humble opinion and and if you haven't read my free book that uh I published about a year ago uh learn to code and get a developer job literally the name of the book just Google that or go Google code book and I or learn to code book I think you you should find it pretty quickly um and by finding it and clicking on it and spending a lot of time on the page you help ensure that Google continues to recommend it to people um so uh skills are only one leg of the stool y network and reputation are the other two and I we've talked enough about skills let's jump into networking and building your reputation which are two things that are also instrumental to the hundred devs program yeah yeah like like what is the value of a network why is networking worth your time and energy when it's such an awkward you know thing to do yeah we we have um it's so we have like a lot of like in jokes and things like that that if like you're not part of the community it's kind of like weird to bring up but we refer to most people as clickers uh people that learn how to code and then they just click apply uh and clickers don't get jobs maybe every once in a while somebody gets lucky and they click on a button and they magically get a job but especially in this market clickers don't get jobs and so we do everything in our power to never click apply we want to make sure that we're talking to like real humans that can see our Humanity that can see our ability and our skills and the things that we can do um so that we're not just discarded by some AI ATS system and so from the very beginning of 100 devs we're tasking you with generalized networking and networking I think it's like a scary term that I don't think should be to me networking is just making friends and you want to do things in the beginning that get you comfortable with making friends and so you don't have to start networking by going to like your local python Meetup that's like super hardcore like no if you like Pokemon go play Pokemon at your your local league right or like if you like hiking go on a join like a hiking group and just like share passion with some others get comfortable talking to people and then eventually apply those skills that you learn to places where developers are more likely to hang out and turn those acquaintances into friends and then by the time you're ready to go on the job hunt you ultimately want hundreds of people that you've interacted with over the past year that you could go to and say Hey you saw me where I was here's where I'm at now who should I talk to I'm looking for a job and that's really successful for people so that's phase one of networking phase two is once you go on the hunt it's very targeted we call it building our Hit List where we identify the companies that are Act ly hiring we identify like three to five people at each of those companies and we're doing Outreach to um get in communication with those folks learn more and what we're finding is that a lot of jobs just don't get posted a lot of times folks will be applying for one job that they wind up getting a different one just because they like the person like right we we have this idea that like Tech is this like meritocracy where if you know the skills you get the job it's not it's like people want to work with people that they like they want to work with people that they know and trust and you can you can make that happen for yourself by really kind of going this networking your way in pathway so the term meritocracy is it was like actually like a joke because the author was like this doesn't exist this is absurd like it's who you know and like you're skill unless you're I mean even like the most demonstrably good pianists for example to talk about pianos we talked about it earlier like somebody saw you know um skill in them and like help them get obser you know enrolled in some Observatory or they had the time to play piano a lot with all the other kids who were working in the shoe factory you know in the you know Industrial Revolution or whatever right like like it takes so and everybody's circumstances are different so I just want to like put the bed because I've never talked about this on the podcast but we don't use the word meritocracy on here except to say that things aren't a meritocracy because they aren't it's ridiculous to think that they are uh the the person who came up with it I think in a book was like just joking about it um yeah yeah he he defined meritocracy as like I think effort and intelligence and how do you build intelligence through effort right some of it may be like you know endowed upon you uh but for most part we all work really hard I study you know foreign languages like an hour a day I play bass an hour a day you know and like I still suck at those things but sucking at something is the first step to being good at something right um so I also wanted this describe or like Define like an acronym uh ATS is uh applicant tracking system system yeah yeah when you apply through like a web form you're like applying into some algorithm that's going to be say okay we didn't ask if they have a college degree because it's hip to say that we don't look for people who have college degrees but in reality our system is going to just filter you out because you don't have a college degree we didn't put it on the thing but you know I I think I I heard some uh study that like uh it was a recent study like 700 job postings that didn't say they required a degree like zero people got those jobs for software engineering for those roles even though they didn't say because if you don't have a degree the ATS just simply filters you out no human ever even reviews right but like the way I got my first job as a do as a developer was through meetup.com going to like local Ruby developer Meetup and I got a job as a rails developer and the interview was very similar maybe you can describe the typical interview the hunter devs folks go through because it's not like Elite code whiteboard maybe for some of them but a lot of it is like hey I've already seen your projects I know you can code are you a good fit for our organization right it's about 5050 we're talking across hundreds of people that have gotten jobs that I've like literally seen right and people have come and talked about them during our huddles so we have a celebrations channel on our Discord where you can like go through and see hundreds of people their stories how they got the jobs what the interviews were like and so that's really powerful to know that but it's about 50/50 and it's when they when they do an interview we're talking about sometimes there's not going to be like Elite code style portion there's still going to be behavioral questions there's still going to be technical questions you're still going to be walking through a process project you might do some light like coding together but for about half the folks that have gotten jobs they haven't done like a leak code style question the other half you will and then there's varying degrees of it and so so many folks focus on like grinding out Le code until their eyes bleed and it's like yeah if you're going for Fang sure that needs to be the thing that you do but if you're going for a local health care company in your mediumsized city they're probably not going to know like like they're probably not going to go through and do that level of interviewing and so one of the things we always say is like don't go into your interviews like an accident always ask what you're about to walk into they'll tell you like almost every single time if you just say like hey like I'm putting a lot of time and energy into this application I would really appreciate just being fully prepared what am I about to walk into in this interview and they'll tell you oh you're just going to meet with so and so and talk through a project great now you know how to prep for That interview don't ever go into an interview if you don't know what you're about to walk into and so about half of our jobs have been not really needing some of those more aggressive skills but it's a huge smell test it's a sniff test uh we like to say every single person that starts off at 100 Dev smells there's something about you that's going to stop you from getting the job and it's your job to like figure out what it is get rid of the smell and make sure you come across as a cool confident professional that's done this been there and has ready to get to work and if you can do that you're going to be really successful getting jobs and even focus that want to go the other more traditional interviews with like the leak codes and things like that you're still passing a sniff test I have seen folks that I consider just amazing even done like competitive programming that do well in interviews and don't get the job and they wonder why and then you look at the resume and you look at how they present themselves and their narrative all that stuff matters it really matters you need to invest time in opening that those doors as well yeah absolutely and I just want to emphasize like if you can figure out what that smell is maybe it's that I don't have a degree and like I'm getting filtered out of ATS or or people are just not looking at me as a serious per like a serious candidate just based on that virtue you can absolutely correct for that and I have lots of friends like free C like lots of people on the free C Camp team dropped out of college or never even went to college right um and it's it's just one of those things where you have to figure out like and empathize with like the HR person or whoever you're talking to and figure out what it is they're they're sniffing for because usually they're just trying to figure out a way to quickly weed people out yeah so to speak so they don't have to inter right once you know like I don't know one of the things we try really hard at 100 devs is to like make sure you know all the like hacks and the secrets and like what's really happening and so recruiters are using some sort of like we said ATS some sort of filter you know what to add to your resume to get past those filters we use things like CV compiler which is like a website that'll tell you like what you're missing um we have like our own resume template that's like battle tested we follow like the true fshaped pattern like if you watch recruiters with eye tracking there's a video that's going really popular it's done it again where you like watch the way they look they read left or right like most folks that read English they're looking for those specific keywords at the frontload of the fshape pattern right so if you know these things you can you can get past these like screen segments and the other thing is people really need to work on how they talk about themselves people people go into the hunt too humble this is your this is like your one chance in life to talk your talk uh be proud of your previous experience I don't care what you've done having that pre PRI pre like previous experience makes you a badass and brings different skills to the table than someone that did a fouryear CS has only ever worked in computer science like they're there're you're different and that difference can be a value ad to a lot of companies and so knowing how to craft that into a narrative like a logical reason from what you were doing to why you're the best software engineer they have in their candidate pool and being able to talk about yourself highly is super important so if you're listening what is your narrative what is your story why are you the coolest thing since sliced bread walking into that interview and that's what we do a lot during like our huddles and at 100 do we have whole nights where we just craft stories we'll have dozens of people come up they give us their their life history and we craft the narrative live and then you just see an instant difference in in how they're going through applications yeah and so first of all I would love if you can share the links to those uh the CV I'll pull up C compil like if you have resume template and like we we've talked a lot about um 100s and I feel like we could talk a whole lot more first of all I want to make sure you still have a few minutes finish I'm good to go for as long as you'll have me awesome well that's great news um the the main uh the main limiter is going to be the fact that I've drinken like literally like two liters of tea while I'm standing here talking with you so I may have to go to the bathroom at some point but what we um what I really want is just to tease out as many like high level insights that we can get into this podcast like like I just want to end on as many pieces of actionable advice as you can share as somebody who has become a developer worked as a software engineer who's even like built a successful project I guess three or two projects and then you're very actively high high up in resilient coders too which sounds like a really uh and I want to tease as many of those out of you as I can sure uh for the for the benefit of the audience and for the benefit of myself I've been furiously taking notes through this whole thing so some questions I have are um I guess what are some questions I should be asking what what are some interesting things that people never ask you that like are really helpful um that would be helpful for the many people out there learning the code well well okay what is a big mistake we can we can think about that maybe you can think of some other uh things but what is a big mistake that you see developers make other than you know over optimizing on their skills for example and and not enough on their Network or their reputation or figuring out how to empathize with recruiters and and I I don't mean like he buddies with them but like you always want to understand other people's perspectives there's no disadvantage to having more perspectives kind of compacted in your head being able to build with more verisimilitude models of other people and how they're approaching the world and what they're looking for how you can find the job that needs to be done and you can do it for that person right yeah I guess I'll I'll gear it towards folks that are like learning how to code and trying to get a job I think the biggest mistake outside of the things like not investing early in networking and um over investing in things that aren't going to really move the needle in terms of you getting a job is there's there's two things that I think lead to most folks not being successful and the number one thing is going into your day is like an accident if you're going into your days like an accident and you don't have a game plan for your day your week your month and you're trying to commit to a process that's going to take years you're not going to be successful and I've worked from with folks from all different walks of life the folks that make a plan for what they want like what do you want for yourself what do you want for your family what do you want for your loved ones like what do you want and then what are the steps you're going to take to get there that plan helps you get through the trough ofar it helps you get through through the the days where you don't have motivation when the discipline is is is is fleeting how do you stay true to like what you want and you should have it written down you should have it on your wall you should you should there's a reason why I have your photo as like the background of my wallpaper every once in a while is because I need to know what I'm shooting for and like what do I want like what do I want for myself what do I want for my community and like having that why go everyone that's that's trying to learn code needs to go on some long walks with no podcast no music no anything thing and just ask yourself what do I want like what's my future like what do I want for myself because until you have that it's really hard to to push through and so I have a lot of people that come and they they say they want it but they only kind of want it right there's like a very famous Dr Eric Thomas speech like they just kind of want it and until you really want it and that can come from a lot of different ways it can come from being [ __ ] hungry it can come from uh wanting the respect of your your family like it can come from a lot of different places but until you have that you're not going to you're not going to make it through um and yeah so having that hammered down and really having it visible putting it somewhere on the wall like knowing what it is and then every day before I go to bed I write out the three things I want to get done the next day once a month I what are my goals for the month once a year like not once a year every couple months like what am I trying to get done for the year and I I hold myself to it and the last piece I'll say about this is I get Buy in from the folks that matter most to me so it's not something internal to me like I know if I want to be successful in this I need to get the Buy in of my my wife right hey this is the thing I want to do it's going to take a lot of time it's going to take some nights and weekends away from us being together and and with our family and I I need you to understand why I'm doing it why it's important and can I have a little bit of your trust and I'll prove that to you over time that it's worthwhile investment but I need you to know like why I'm doing this and get that buy in um because you don't have that buy in especially if you're like stay still at home with family that doesn't get it if you're um not being as present with your loved ones there that that's going to build up some resentment and for a lot of folks that's another reason why they're not successful so yeah don't go into your days like an accident have a plan for your days know what your why is and get Buy in from the folks that matter most yeah that getting Buy in is so important because learning to codes a long long journey and you get all hyped up you get like these uh you know probably YouTube ads or um you know ads on the side of your coding tutorials learn to code in just three months and get a job paying like 200k and like you know whatever you know and to be fair there are plenty of developers who do learn to code very quickly and do get jobs uh I've had lots of friends who transitioned from working on Wall Street and they went to some expensive intensive coding program and they were able to then go get a job in Silicon Valley but they already had college degrees uh they already had you know like probably figured out how to plan uh they they probably had an understanding of like a lot of the you know learning techniques that we've been talking about and and most importantly they had a lot of money and they were able to just focus on it exclusively and and attend an intensive inperson boot camp like and and that era may have passed it may be that it's just a little harder now uh to to be able to get a job just because you should learn math right like it used to be back in the day you could just learn some WordPress and you could probably go get some clients doing WordPress work and it may be that case but with the global market and the level of competition you're going to get from places like India Nigeria China like tons of extremely educated extremely hungry people are coming from all these places and you know frankly they're going to eat your lunch if you're not putting in the time and effort Benjamin Franklin said few people plan to fail most people who fail fail the plan that's a paraphrase of what he said it's not exct no it's perfect yeah but but it is like 100% what Leon's saying here um and uh yeah so I just want to emphasize like getting Buy in from your family like when I learned a code again I don't want to make this all about me but like I told my wife like hey like I've got this job as a soft as a School director right and I would like to become a software engineer and we had doubled income we had insurance which is a huge deal here in the US uh through her work and so even if I left my job we we could continue to have health insurance and I just grinded every single day and I every I did precisely what you're talking about planning out okay what am I going to accomplish the next few days because planning is everything like it it's so important to have a plan and to stick to a plan and to have goals that are measurable and that are within your control that's another mistake I see a lot of people make is people will be like my goal is to get you know 100,000 YouTube subscribers this year or my goal is to get you know a job paying like n1,000 or or to get n freelance clients you know those are not things that you can directly control you can't control the outcome but you can control the input my my goal is to play base for an hour a day right or you know whatever goal I might have at a given moment uh yeah James James Clear of like Atomic habits has that very famous quote that I love so much that he says we don't rise to the level of our goals we fall to the levels of our systems and so this idea like we can have all these lofty goals but if you're not putting in the systems the how you're going to study uh play the Basse for an hour each day study your languages for an hour each day and and the process for that uh it's just not going to work out for you in the long run absolutely so we've talked a lot and of course you and I we grew up in the US you grew up in Philly I grew up in Oklahoma City um and you know here in the US even though things are not equal by aone shot it's very unequal Society we still have vestages of you know history yeah going back 400 years right like uh they warp uh the essentially The Haves and the Have Nots and um but in the US we're pretty well off compared to folks in a lot of countries uh for example like the hyper competition in places like India and China where you've got like so many people getting like CS degrees and trying to compete and so few employers or Nigeria where there are so many amazing developers like I think it's like the third or fourth largest community in free Cod Camp people that use free C Camp is Nigeria but if you look at Nigeria there aren't a lot of big employers and the government's kind of a mess and as a result there's not a lot of opportunity even though there's a lot of talent so a lot of those people have to move overseas to like Europe or to to the United States or wherever they can find opportunity right like a lot of the what is the proportion of people doing 100 devs who are outside of the US and uh how what have you observed about those people that that might be helpful for them uh yeah and and like just a followup questional tack on is like do they need to move to the US to be able to be successful in software engineering or are there other paths you've seen people succeed with yeah so I would say about half our community is from the US and about half is from everywhere else in fact the first jobs we ever got got were not from the US they were from Brazil then Poland UK and then a bunch of other places in South America uh and so a lot of our community and folks that have gotten jobs haven't been from the like us Centric and so the first thing I always say is whenever somebody from outside the US says I want to get a job I just tell them bluntly it's way harder don't let anyone convince you that it's going to be the same pathway as somebody from the US it's going to be a way more difficult journey and there's a very couple of like very key things that you have to keep in mind um one the Visa sponsorship ISS issue in the United States is wild it goes to a lottery most years right and so banking on that is like a pathway into an engineering career if you're from a area that doesn't have like that strong of a local Tech economy is very hard the competition for companies that hire remotely is brutal and it's even more brutal when you look at the companies that hire globally so a lot of people think oh I'll get a remote Tech job no even even though they're remote they only hire folks from the US or from a very specific select countries so finding a a group of folks that hire globally remotely uh that's a very narrow pool so the first thing I would recommend that you do is build a hit list of those companies there are list you can find online there are couple hundred of those companies you need to be best friends with everybody that works at that company and you mentioned building your reputation this is something I really recommend folks that are coming from from uh a location do to have a traditional Tech economy is your reputation matters a lot we talk about building authority a lot in 100 Dev so picking a niche or a topic that you know very very well generating content around it so when somebody thinks about I don't know authentication they think about you and the blog post you've written and the depth of knowledge that you can bring that way when you're applying to these Global remote companies you have something that nobody else really has this like intangible thing that helps set you apart and so the first thing I say it's harder building authority or reputation is super important and not going into your job search like an accident it's not going to happen if you don't have a very strong game plan and you're building the references and helping pass that sniff test that these companies are putting out there if you do those things you'll be successful we've helped hundreds of people in that situation get a job it's just a way more difficult pathway yeah and uh just on that note of like building authority like what are some of the most I guess immediate things someone can do like let's say you already have the skills let's say you've been coding for a long time and you just want to be able to get a job preferably at like a multinational company many of which are of course usbased um and you would love over the next five or 10 years to eventually get a visa and come to the US where salaries are like double what they are in Europe and and where we have a high degree of Freedom that people in other countries don't necessarily enjoy I mean it it is a good place to live like uh I like living in the us right I guess it's easier for me to say that it's like a middle class guy uh who speaks English natively and has US citizenship and doesn't have to deal with like my H1B you know being shifted around and like getting companies to sponsor me and all that stuff but like like I can definitely understand the appeal I can understand why so many people are trying you know to immigrate to the US every day but like what would be some uh practical ways that they can establish Authority as you said yeah so I think when you are trying to stand out amongst lots of other talented individuals doesn't have to be anything wild uh I really do think building a list of companies that are on your targeted range um and the H1B processes we I I've helped sponsor a lot of h1bs like it's we could talk about like that's a whole other beast in of itself that's like you have to be of an exceptional talent you have to do these things to help you stand out like that's a whole other thing you're talking about like Global remote company like what can you do right now I'm thinking about somebody right now that wants to to to to get a a job my my process probably wouldn't be the H1B coming to the US right away it' be these like Global remote companies and then maybe expanding to companies that could sponsor um but a lot of times you're going to need more more credentials you're going to need like degrees might actually become a Thing If you're trying to go that sponsorship route um so I recommend right now if you're someone in Nigeria or India um looking at these Global hire in remote companies figuring out what they do building a list of them building a list of all the people that you know that work there adding them to a Twitter list right like each person add them to a Twitter list start engaging with their content just liking stuff at first don't be spamming don't be weird just like engaging with them liking their content congratulating them when they get a a new project built right like building that network of folks that know who you are over time like you become like an acquaintance like you can go from nobody to like they have no idea who you are to an acquaintance just by regular interaction on LinkedIn Twitter and it's there's a fine line between like being weird with it right we at 100 do we always joke it's not stalking it's networking and so you want to make sure that you're not like Crossing that line um and then starting to realize what these companies have trouble with right like you're you're engaging with these content you're seeing the things that they're doing are they having trouble implementing I don't know AI or llms great right that's the content you need to start generating build your Authority about how do they integrate these tools into their daily process you should have a Blog you should have um a YouTube you should have something where you're putting content out there you're getting feedback from them and from community of some sort to where you're building up that hey I I'm not just somebody that says I do this you can you can look at my content you can look at the things I'm doing uh you can look at the the things that I say I've done and be able to see that very clearly and also by doing that you're practicing how you talk about these things you're practicing um maybe if English is your second language you're getting more comfortable with these things that when it comes time the pass the sniff test you are because these people you've been engaging with for a year plus they've seen your content they know who you are they know what you're capable of that makes getting into these orgs a little bit easier absolutely 100% agreed uh based on my limited knowledge I I think it sounds like you have a lot more knowledge about that so what I would like to ask then is like let's flip this around employers who want to bring in more folks uh and and this can we can we can definitely start by talking about folks from overseas if you want Talent if you want to be able to tap that talent and you don't want to like go to some consultancy or something in some other country and say give me like 20 devs right go to infosis or whatever like you want to literally get the best talent from India or from Nigeria just by picking developer by developer yourself you're trying to build out your company or or you're a hiring manager and you're just trying to build a team you're you know like what strategies what advice would you give to those people so that they can actually find talented people and what should they be looking for yeah I think Partnerships are really great so we work with a lot of hiring Partners at resilient coders we've sent dozens of folks to Amazon through resilient coders we sent we have these very strong Partnerships with a lot of orgs that need a good solid pipeline of talent and so partnering with communities is a really good way to do that um if you came to RC res coders or you came to 100 devs and you said give me the best of the best I would talk to you I'd make sure that your job is doing all the things that it needs to be done to be do to be done equitably and if I felt that that was the case I would give you all the folks you would have a pipeline that was full for days of Highly qualified incredibly talented Talent um from wherever you needed them to be from or or or anywhere you'd want to support as well like we can make that happen and so I think think for folks that are looking for a good pipeline just working with communities so I would of course say working with myself you um I always think of uh Paris black Tech pipeline does this work really well where they're able to get you a very strong source of talent um from anywhere from entry level to super senior uh and so figuring out these different orgs that have a surplus of talented engineering Talent um could be a great way to build those those funnels for you yeah absolutely and then uh for organizations that just want to be more representative of the folks in their Community let's say like it's not necessarily remote but here in the US uh Los Angeles for example like there's a tech startup and they're looking for engineers what I guess General tips would you give to employers so that they can they can be inclusive and they can make sure that they're bringing on talent that actually represents the local population instead of just bringing in a bunch of you know Stanford GRS or something like that right yeah I I think it takes Champions within a company that actually care about these things of course you can read like the McKenzie reports a more diverse Workforce equals better outcomes right so a lot of companies know these things to be true but it takes someone on the inside that cares about building an equitable Workforce for this to actually happen especially when things like Dei and these initiatives are being contested in the courts a lot of companies are becoming a little bit more um shy around being ten toes down right and so I think if this is the case it really doesn't come from top down it comes from individuals looking around and saying you know what I live in a community that is 25% black and brown but only 1% of our Workforce is of color there's something fundamentally wrong here when we looked in Boston where I spent most of my career we had the second largest tech economy but double digit unemployment rates in our communities of color there's a there's a fundamental mismatch and so we had a group of individuals that realized that this is just woly inequitable and they would go to town they would go to fight the fight every single day to bring one person along than to bring two along and the thing is it can compound once you have folks in these positions of power you can turn around and help lift up more along with you so I don't think it needs to be like like a companywide thing I think anybody that's listening to this call has this ability to fight for what they know is right to turn around and say you know what I want want to make an equitable pathway in my company and I'm going to work really really hard for the next open rule for it to be someone that deserves to be here but might not have the opportunity yeah and that's a huge part of 100 devs like as far as I can tell from like listening to a lot of your episodes and stuff like instead of asking people to like necessarily donate to 100 FS or uh like you tell them send the elevator back down is is something you've said a few times like like try for every one of the 100 devs cohort members the the Learners they should try to find somebody else who's in Alum and bring them onto their company so they can kind of uh essentially be increasing the number of alumni within these organizations in the free software Community we have a word grus right it's not it's not free it's grus meaning that there's like no cost like there's no like monetary cost and so 100 devs is grce I mean there's no like money should no money should ever come out of your pocket I never want to see a dollar come out of your pocket for anything um there's no way that you can give us that dollar we don't want it but it's not free and the reason why it's not free is because we expect that when you get the job that you turn around and help three more get into the same position that you have whether it's helping answer questions whether it is literally helping people apply and get into the pipeline for your company the the expectation is that this community has in invested thousands and hours into your success and the thing that we ask is that you turn around and give a little bit of that time back and that's the reason why 100 death has been so successful is that we have folks that have made it to the the upper echelon that are now senior developers at the best tech companies in the world that are still giving up their time every single day on our Discord and our huddles to make sure that the next folks are successful that is a beautiful note to end on just the the the virtue of this organization that You' birthed into the world uh but let's not end quite yet because I want to ask what are the future initiatives what yeah does the next what what does 2024 the rest of 2024 maybe even 2025 2026 free we think literally a decade out like we're working on this computer science degree program that will take another six years to complete all the course workk for plus another five years to gather longitudinal data plus probably another five years to have the data AC you know approved by accreditor so we can get uh the degree program accredited free computer science uh bachelor's degree free which I was super on I don't I I was tweeting up a story I was telling everybody and their mom I was running and showing my wife like look this is this is this is the future like this is this is the thing that uh we need the most in the world right now and so I'm super happy that that's like on your your vision education wants to be free yeah exactly like this is it right like doing the work like and like we said earlier I I think free C Camp is amazing at identifying the real gaps like the things that people really need to be successful and filling them and having a community that's willing to step up and do that work to fill those gaps um so something I the reason why it's the best donation I make every single week it's the reason why um I always uh send folks to free code count because I know that they're in safe hands to like get the things they need done yeah um free isn't free for everyone right in terms of time and commitment a lot of folks that would be extremely successful at 100 devs right like the the the cliche line is that like um skill and talent is distributed opportunity is not right and so we have a lot of folks that are extremely talented that um could be phenomenal software Engineers but don't have the opportunity or the privilege of time they need to take that time they would be spending learning d driving for Uber doing door Dash they they need to take that time to put food on the table for their family and when we pulled our our our Collective we we saw that folks really only needed around $200 a week to like make this a viable pathway so our huge big goal is to build out an agency model where real companies come they have work that they need for us to to accomplish we have super season profession Professional Engineers that lead those projects and then we break those projects down into individual issues or tasks so that as you're learning you're also maybe picking up some of these tasks in a real code base like your skills become intensely practical and by the time you graduate or leave 100 devs you've built real projects for real companies with production level code and all the money that comes into the agency goes directly into those issues so that you're also getting a little bit of money coming in as you're working through it and we think that might make our program more Equitable for folks that just don't have that last little bit of privilege of free time and so like I said we talked about earlier we're a group of people that run head first into really big audacious goals sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't we're going to have a lot of mistakes a lot of things are going to go wrong but we're going to figure it out and our goal is that when we launch our next cohort uh we also have this agency model in place as well so that you're not only learning but getting this practical paid experience as well yeah that's so cool I mean that's like we're all about taking away excuses from people like and and like to be fair like a lot of excuses like if you have young kids or if you're taking care of your folks if you're working like three jobs to be able to pay exorbitant rent in your city you know like those are very reasonable reasons for not being able to spend a lot of time coding but if there are things you can do to remove some of those barriers uh to to make it easier for people to commit to an already arduous process of learning the code right and nobody anybody who says learning to code is easy is trying to tell you something like it is hard as heck it's getting easier every year it's we're not dealing with Punch Cards you know we're getting higher levels of abstraction it is becoming easier but it's not Star Trek easy where you just talk to the computer right uh eventually it will be but maybe in the 21th century the more immediate problem how helping people free up their time so they can actually learn I just want to commend you on this program like I love the idea of getting people out there doing real world work getting compensation through some sort of program where they can just I mean even $200 a week it sounds like it's going to be a huge Lifeline for a lot of these folks and free up a lot of time and energy um this is extremely exciting and I would be very excited to have you back on in the future catch up and like see what you learned from running this this new uh experiment that you're running this bold endeavor I'll let you know how it goes awesome man well it's been such a joy learning so much from you not just from this conversation but just you know following you on Twitter I'm going to add links to a lot of stuff that we' talked about in here I'm going to of course link to 100 devs and I just encourage people to learn more about the work of Leon learn more about uh 100 devs resilient coders these organizations that uh you know like resilient coders is a charity like Freo Camp 51 C3 and um you know like there are lots of Charities out there that are doing important work I'm going to try to like uh encourage people to do what we've done the two of us and yes you can create a startup and make a lot of money and you know lifechanging money especially if you've got like family that are back in a home country that that need support right or if you have like any number of different there I will never give people a hard time about just wanting to make a whole lot of money but if you have the means if you are somebody who's midcareer and wants to do something in the charity space I hope that uh the accomplishments of Leon and and modestly free Co camp and the pro like modestly there's no mod that needs to to be had there yeah yeah I I I hope some of this will inspire you to also consider you know doing work in the public space right as a tax exempt public charity uh and and again I just want to commend the work you're doing Leon and um I hope everybody has learned a great deal I appreciate it thank you so much like I said this is a a dream come true uh you've inspired me so much throughout my entire journey into this and uh I know you do the same for so many other folks each and every single day so thank you for the work that you do and uh and our communities right that that help push this stuff through yeah and and to everybody in the hund devs community that's watching this uh hang in there keep it up man there we go man and woman uh you all are doing a long grueling process but you're helping one another and you know you're making friends along the way so um with that I I just want to thank everybody for tuning in until next week happy coding
