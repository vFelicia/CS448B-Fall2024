00:02 - hey what's up welcome back to css3 at 30
00:05 - days today we are going to be doing
00:07 - something really fun and that is
00:09 - creating a
00:11 - pac-man animation we're going to make a
00:13 - little pac-man chasing the blinky ghost
00:16 - across the screen and it's gonna be a
00:18 - lot of fun now what is pac-man uh if you
00:20 - don't know what pac-man is
00:22 - then google it i don't know anyone who
00:24 - doesn't know what pac-man is pac-man is
00:26 - a classic arcade game
00:28 - it's timeless it's a little yellow
00:30 - chomping uh ball that eats little
00:32 - pebbles along this maze and there's
00:35 - ghosts chasing him and when he gets a
00:37 - special pebble he gets to chase the
00:39 - ghosts and eat the ghosts and get bonus
00:40 - points really fun simple little game and
00:43 - we're just going to create a nice simple
00:45 - animation of pac-man moving along a pat
00:48 - moving along a path chasing the ghost so
00:50 - check this out in my browser and i'm
00:52 - going to show you what we're making
00:53 - check it out right here here it is
00:56 - now there are
00:58 - a number of things going on here all of
01:00 - this
01:01 - this entire thing is css
01:05 - just css there's no javascript nothing
01:07 - like that it's purely css
01:09 - animations and css3
01:12 - and that's what's exciting about it so
01:14 - let's check out what's going on here we
01:15 - have the path in the background with
01:17 - these little pebbles it's very simple it
01:18 - looks like he's eating them we also have
01:20 - a circle here and that circle is
01:22 - chomping
01:24 - and moving as well so a couple things
01:26 - there then we have this ghost blinky
01:29 - what blinky is doing is
01:31 - uh quite literally blinking colors so
01:33 - he's moving along the timeline as well
01:35 - along the path and he's blinking colors
01:37 - in and out from red to hot pink
01:40 - and he also has big googly eyes and his
01:43 - pupils are moving back and forth so he's
01:46 - got a number of things going on i
01:47 - haven't seen a css tutorial online yet
01:51 - other than this one where
01:53 - they
01:54 - code the ghost as well i've only seen
01:56 - css pac-man animations
01:59 - in varying degrees uh in different
02:01 - examples but i haven't seen one with the
02:02 - ghost so i wanted to throw the ghost in
02:04 - here because it's kind of exciting
02:06 - all right so let's get coding let's make
02:08 - our pacman and let's make our goats and
02:10 - let's animate them right now so jump
02:11 - over here in your code editor download
02:13 - 17 pacman you got the three files there
02:17 - again give you a moment to download
02:19 - those files and come right back here
02:22 - and and then i'm going to show you
02:23 - what's going on here so we've got our
02:24 - index file with some markup and i'm
02:26 - going to show you what's going on in
02:28 - terms of the html
02:30 - this is what the html looks like for the
02:32 - pacman we have a div with the class of
02:34 - path wraps everything that is the
02:36 - container which is simply that black
02:39 - path right here
02:41 - with the dots inside then we have div
02:43 - with the class of pac-man that is
02:44 - pac-man that's it for pac-man
02:47 - then we have a div the class of ghost
02:48 - which wraps uh a div with the class of
02:50 - eyes and div with the class of skirt so
02:53 - the eyes are the eyes and the pupils
02:56 - the skirt is the the bottom of the ghost
02:58 - those triangles that look like a skirt
03:01 - so and that's it for the markup you
03:04 - don't have to code it because it's
03:05 - already there this isn't an html course
03:07 - it's a css course but just to show you
03:08 - how simple the html is and all the magic
03:11 - happens in css jump into your sandbox
03:14 - okay so let's get started let's jump in
03:17 - and say we're going to start with path
03:20 - and that path is going to be a
03:22 - position of relative
03:25 - a width of 100 a height of 100 pixels
03:29 - a background of triple three but
03:31 - whatever color you want it to be works
03:33 - as well padding 20 pixels all around box
03:36 - sizing i want to be border box because i
03:38 - want it to be a fixed 100 pixel height
03:41 - if i
03:42 - don't declare border box i'm going to
03:44 - have 140 pixel height element because
03:47 - the padding adds to that height so i
03:48 - want it to be border box to keep that
03:50 - padding within it so the element is 100
03:52 - pixels height max
03:55 - overflow hidden very important because
03:58 - when the ghost when blinky and pac-man
04:00 - go off the screen out of the element i
04:02 - want them to disappear not slide outside
04:05 - and be visible and be kind of odd
04:07 - it would look like a little glitch
04:10 - so that's it for the path save that
04:12 - check it out here in the browser it's
04:14 - just gonna be a big long um
04:16 - like a dark gray rectangle all right
04:19 - jump back in here i'm just gonna
04:21 - tab in one and say path
04:24 - virtual element after
04:26 - content
04:27 - empty string
04:28 - position relative note position absolute
04:33 - okay
04:34 - display block
04:36 - border top
04:38 - 12 pixels dotted white what we're making
04:40 - here are those little pebbles along the
04:43 - middle of the path
04:45 - now if i say width 90 i have to give it
04:48 - a width because of the condition that
04:50 - it's in it's an after virtual element
04:53 - that you cannot see until you give a
04:55 - width
04:56 - and or a height
04:58 - so we got the width uh and the height is
05:00 - the 12 pixels of the top border so
05:03 - simply i'm creating an element
05:05 - that is
05:06 - just a top border
05:08 - the width is 90
05:10 - if we save that and check it out here in
05:11 - the browser we've got it right here
05:12 - we've got our 12 pixel dotted border
05:15 - we've got our 20 pixel padding on the
05:17 - left and the top as you can see very
05:19 - clearly
05:20 - the problem is is that this is not
05:22 - centered within the path
05:25 - vertically or horizontally so let's deal
05:27 - with that right now over here in the
05:28 - code editor simply going to say
05:31 - top 50 that's going to push it down 50
05:34 - percent of
05:35 - the height of that parent element
05:37 - and left five percent because
05:40 - we are ninety percent width if we want
05:41 - to fill a 100 width if we push it over
05:43 - five percent there's also five percent
05:45 - on the other side so now we're perfectly
05:47 - centered in terms of the top fifty
05:49 - percent we're going to have a little
05:51 - problem save that check it out it's
05:53 - perfectly centered horizontally but
05:54 - we've got too much space in the top
05:56 - that's because it's going 50 percent
05:59 - down from the top of this element so
06:01 - this actually here to here is exactly 50
06:04 - but i want it to be 50 from the center
06:07 - of these these uh dots
06:09 - because those dots are 12 pixels in
06:11 - height half of that if we bring it up
06:13 - half of those pixels it's going to be
06:15 - perfectly centered so margin top
06:17 - negative 6 pixels save that bam now we
06:20 - are perfectly centered both vertically
06:22 - and horizontally all right now let's get
06:25 - down to the fun stuff let let's create
06:27 - pac-man
06:29 - there's pac-man we're gonna say position
06:32 - absolute
06:33 - zed index 99 so he's always on top of
06:36 - everything top 50 we want him down 50
06:40 - from the
06:41 - top of the the path and now um that's it
06:44 - for now now you're not going to see
06:46 - pac-man because he is simply just a
06:48 - position a z-index and a top
06:52 - value there's nothing
06:54 - showing us visually that it's pac-man
06:56 - where that's going to come into play is
06:58 - the before and after virtual elements so
07:02 - let's go down
07:04 - and style those up we're going to say
07:05 - pac-man
07:07 - before and
07:09 - pac-man
07:11 - after
07:13 - in here we're going to give him content
07:14 - of an empty string display block and
07:17 - we're going to say height 0
07:19 - width 0 this is weird why are we doing
07:21 - this
07:22 - well we're actually going to create
07:24 - pac-man out of a border not actually out
07:28 - of creating a background color
07:31 - okay so we're gonna say position
07:33 - absolute
07:36 - and then we're gonna go border solid 30
07:39 - pixels yellow
07:42 - that save that check it out in the
07:44 - browser it's going to give us a yellow
07:45 - square
07:46 - and that's because we have we have a 60
07:48 - by 60 element because there's
07:52 - uh there's a border top there's a border
07:54 - left there's a border bottom and there's
07:55 - a border right of 30 pixels so now what
07:57 - we're going to do
07:58 - is
08:00 - we're going to remove certain sides of
08:03 - the border in order to give us the
08:05 - illusion or make it look like we have
08:07 - half circles now what do i mean by half
08:09 - circles i'm styling both before and
08:11 - after with these identical styles so
08:13 - there are two elements on top of each
08:14 - other if i move one over say pac-man
08:18 - after and i give him margin left of like
08:22 - like 65 pixels save that check it out in
08:25 - the browser i moved him over
08:28 - just enough so you can see there's two
08:30 - and so now now we're gonna leave it like
08:32 - that for now and then style it up so you
08:34 - can see what they both look like let's
08:36 - go back here to before and after and
08:38 - let's say margin top i want it to be
08:41 - negative 30 pixels so he's centered in
08:43 - that path
08:45 - border radius
08:47 - 100 should do the trick or 50
08:51 - 50 is fine should give us a perfect
08:53 - circle if i save that and check it out
08:55 - in the browser we got two perfect
08:56 - circles sitting in the middle of the
08:57 - path now let's remove some sides of the
09:00 - border
09:02 - border right
09:04 - color
09:05 - transparent
09:09 - save that
09:10 - check it out so i removed the right
09:12 - border of the four sides and now it
09:15 - actually looks like pac-man we're not
09:17 - going to stop there because we actually
09:19 - want two parts to this pac-man a top
09:21 - part and a bottom part
09:23 - and we're gonna make those chomp
09:24 - together
09:26 - in this manner i don't really know if i
09:28 - were just to have one chunk out of one
09:30 - side of a circle i don't really know how
09:32 - to connect those in an animation but
09:33 - what we can do is create two of these
09:36 - elements and animate them individually
09:38 - so it looks like there's a chomping
09:40 - animation
09:42 - this
09:42 - method specifically
09:45 - i'm going to give credit to travis
09:47 - nielsen of dev tips
09:49 - in his css animations tutorials on
09:52 - youtube check him out
09:54 - uh he created a pac-man loader and he
09:57 - did basically pac-man he called him a
10:00 - chomper chomp chomp
10:02 - and um
10:03 - he used the before and after virtual
10:05 - elements and animated those individually
10:07 - so uh i am going to give credit where
10:09 - credit is due
10:10 - this specific part is uh inspired by
10:12 - travis so thank you for that um the rest
10:15 - of it however is a mishmash of me just
10:17 - jamming and trying to figure out how to
10:19 - make this work
10:20 - so
10:22 - let's show you what's going on border
10:23 - right color we're also going to say
10:25 - border
10:26 - bottom color is transparent now watch
10:29 - what happens save that check it out bam
10:31 - now we've got two half circles because
10:33 - we cut out two parts of the border but
10:34 - now what we're going to do is make the
10:37 - the after virtual element
10:41 - uh have kind of an inverted version of
10:43 - that so we can you'll see what i mean so
10:45 - let's give the after pseudo element the
10:47 - border color of yellow to reset it back
10:50 - to a circle there it is
10:52 - now what we're going to do is say border
10:55 - right color
10:56 - is transparent
10:58 - and the border
11:01 - top color
11:03 - is transparent as well
11:05 - if i save that and check it out now we
11:07 - got the other side now this will make a
11:10 - lot more sense if i remove this margin
11:13 - left of pacman after and now they're
11:16 - connected and they look like a pac-man
11:18 - all we have to do now is animate those
11:21 - two separately to rotate
11:25 - a certain amount of degrees
11:27 - on both sides so it looks like a chomper
11:30 - let's do that right now so simply go up
11:32 - to
11:33 - the pac-man before after and we're going
11:35 - to give it an animation so animation
11:38 - we're going to name it mouth
11:40 - top and we're gonna do it over 0.7
11:44 - seconds
11:45 - ease
11:46 - infinitely
11:47 - infinite
11:49 - save that it's not going to work until
11:50 - we define a keyframe so go to the bottom
11:52 - and add your keyframes at the bottom of
11:54 - your style sheet that's usually a good
11:55 - place to do it keyframes this one's
11:57 - called mouth top
11:59 - and now it's just simply playing with
12:00 - timelines so we're going to say
12:03 - at the
12:04 - 50
12:06 - point of the timeline so this goes from
12:08 - 0 to one hundred percent
12:11 - you can also define it based on uh
12:13 - seconds i believe but anyway
12:15 - we got fifty percent way through the
12:17 - animation
12:20 - we are going to say transform this is
12:22 - just css rotate
12:25 - i'm going to say 44 degrees
12:27 - specifically chose that number for a
12:29 - reason i'll show you why
12:30 - save that refresh in your browser now
12:33 - it's all rotating 44 degrees
12:36 - but i want the bottom mouth to rotate
12:38 - negative 44 degrees so that one goes up
12:40 - rather than down as well so simply all
12:42 - we have to do is well while we're down
12:44 - here in the keyframes let's define
12:46 - another keyframe copy this one in fact
12:48 - save you some typing paste it call it
12:50 - mouth bottom
12:53 - rotate it negative 44 degrees
12:55 - scroll up to your before and after
12:58 - copy this style right here
13:00 - paste it in the after pseudo element
13:02 - style and change the name to mouth
13:04 - bottom same exact animation just
13:07 - inverted save it check it on the browser
13:09 - bam just like that chomping perfectly
13:12 - now why did i choose 44 well let me show
13:14 - you what happens when i do 46 degrees
13:17 - look at the back end the rear end of
13:19 - pac-man there's a little bit of a oops
13:23 - a little bit of a line that appears
13:24 - there and that's not okay
13:26 - 45 degrees shows the same hair line just
13:28 - a little smaller 44 degrees was the
13:30 - perfect number where i found no line at
13:32 - all where the mouth closed the most
13:36 - okay now all we have to do is move him
13:38 - so let's create another keyframe here
13:40 - and let's call it
13:42 - keyframes
13:43 - move
13:44 - forward
13:46 - and i'm just going to say at
13:49 - zero percent
13:50 - uh of the animation i want pac-man to be
13:54 - negative 20
13:55 - position i'll show you why in a moment
13:59 - and at 100
14:00 - i want him to be at left 100
14:03 - so that the left side of pac-man is
14:05 - going to be 100 so he's going to be off
14:07 - of the screen so if i
14:10 - save this and move up to pac-man
14:13 - give this an animation
14:16 - of
14:19 - animation
14:20 - we called it move forward
14:23 - five seconds linear and infinite save
14:27 - that check it out in the browser watch
14:28 - what happens see how he's coming out
14:30 - from off of the screen on the left side
14:32 - and then disappears on the right that's
14:34 - exactly what we want let me show you in
14:36 - that keyframe what happens if the left
14:37 - is actually zero percent what you might
14:40 - think he starts
14:42 - his left side of the element starts
14:44 - right here
14:46 - so he goes off screen but then just
14:48 - appears
14:49 - out of nowhere and it's not smooth
14:52 - but if we have it left negative 20
14:55 - where we know he's off the screen
14:59 - that's gonna solve the problem he slides
15:00 - out so he goes off the screen
15:03 - like that comes back out gently i like
15:06 - it
15:07 - you might even sample 10 and see what
15:09 - happens there
15:10 - if you wanted you could play around with
15:12 - a number maybe that looks a bit more
15:14 - like he's half off there and half coming
15:16 - out
15:17 - that works too so
15:20 - that's it for move forward now that's it
15:22 - for pac-man actually so
15:24 - we made a pac-man animation
15:26 - i could have left it here but i thought
15:28 - nah i wanna make a ghost and i wanna
15:30 - make that ghost run so let's do that
15:34 - and now we're gonna start styling up
15:35 - this ghost
15:37 - okay so now we're gonna say
15:39 - ghosts
15:42 - should have just called him boo
15:44 - ghost position
15:46 - absolute zed index 99 so he's on top of
15:50 - the screen as well top 50
15:53 - left twenty percent
15:56 - i'm doing that because i want him in
15:57 - front of pac-man i'll show you i'll show
15:59 - you a bit here
16:00 - margin top we're gonna bring him up
16:02 - negative 35 pixels because i want the
16:05 - height to be
16:07 - 70 pixels in height
16:09 - and the width to be 60 pixels in width
16:11 - so margin top is half of 70 so that it's
16:13 - perfectly aligned vertically in the
16:15 - center if i save that and go back here
16:19 - you actually won't see anything
16:20 - because we haven't given him any colors
16:23 - so let's go back to the ghost here again
16:25 - let's go background red let's get make
16:27 - him red save that now check out your
16:28 - browser so we've got a
16:30 - rectangle a red rectangle so now we just
16:32 - need to shape him out so let's say the
16:35 - border top
16:37 - uh
16:38 - the border top left
16:40 - radius is 70 pixels
16:43 - and the border top right radius is 70
16:46 - pixels watch what happens just the top
16:48 - rounds out the top left the top right
16:51 - that looks nice
16:53 - and
16:54 - now
16:55 - let's start
16:56 - shaping him out a little bit more he
16:58 - needs to have that skirt and the eyes
17:00 - so let's
17:02 - let's use as minimal amount of markup as
17:04 - possible
17:05 - and let's say uh goes before now what
17:08 - we're going to do
17:09 - is
17:10 - say goes before and then ghost
17:13 - after
17:15 - and now we're going to use this use the
17:18 - ghost before and after for
17:20 - the
17:21 - the googly eyes the the
17:23 - the white part of his eyes
17:26 - or her eyes
17:27 - content
17:29 - uh empty string position absolute
17:32 - background white
17:34 - height 25 pixels and width 20 pixels i
17:37 - want them to be not a perfect circle i
17:39 - want them to be like a long like a long
17:42 - eyeball
17:45 - border radius uh we're going to make
17:47 - that 100
17:48 - perfectly round
17:50 - uh rounded edges all over the place save
17:52 - it let's check it out see what happened
17:54 - here so we have the right shape i think
17:56 - that's the shape i want
17:58 - both of them are right there they're
17:59 - stacked on top of one another so we're
18:00 - going to have to move that
18:02 - so go back here in your code editor and
18:05 - let's simply say top
18:07 - 15 pixels from the top and then left
18:10 - we're going to go four pixels from the
18:12 - left now really i'm just styling this is
18:14 - where i want the before
18:16 - i to be i want the after eye to be over
18:19 - a bit so simply go down here we're going
18:20 - to declare
18:21 - a ghost
18:23 - after pseudo elements virtual element
18:27 - you know what i mean
18:29 - and we're just going to say left 28
18:31 - pixels that's the only thing we need to
18:32 - change save that check it out we've got
18:35 - our two white eyes starting to come
18:36 - together it looks pretty cool
18:38 - all right
18:40 - now let's style those eyes so i have an
18:44 - element called eyes
18:47 - in the markup but i want to use the
18:48 - before and after virtual elements as
18:50 - well so we're going to go eyes
18:52 - before
18:54 - and eyes
18:55 - after
18:56 - okay now again as usual content empty
18:59 - string so it can be visible on the
19:01 - screen position absolute so we can move
19:02 - it around wherever we want it outside of
19:04 - the flow of the document
19:06 - background blue we want blue eyes
19:10 - heights 10 pixels so these are the
19:11 - pupils
19:12 - i probably could have called these
19:13 - pupils but oh well
19:15 - width 10 pixels border radius 100
19:20 - that's border radius
19:21 - 100
19:23 - and uh save that let's see what's
19:25 - happening okay so there's our little
19:26 - blue eye up there we need to move it
19:28 - down and over a bit so back here
19:30 - top 25 pixels and left 5 pixels save
19:34 - that
19:36 - there it is
19:38 - looks good i don't think i need to do
19:40 - anything else with that one now i just
19:42 - need to move the second eye the after
19:45 - uh virtual element over
19:47 - so i'm going to say eyes
19:50 - after
19:52 - and left is going to be 30 pixels and
19:54 - that will move him over
19:57 - to the right spot i believe save that
19:59 - refresh
20:01 - uh it's i don't i don't see it
20:04 - i think this is a z-index problem go
20:06 - back here and both of them going to say
20:07 - that index 99 again save that bam there
20:10 - it is it was just hidden behind the i
20:12 - you couldn't see it so i needed to move
20:14 - that pupil forward using z-index that
20:17 - was important okay
20:19 - now
20:20 - uh we have one more thing to do here
20:22 - with the the look of this little blinky
20:26 - is the skirt is what i called it so
20:28 - let's go down another style here oops
20:31 - not there let's do it after the eyes
20:34 - and let's go skirt
20:38 - position
20:39 - whoops let's go position absolute
20:42 - height zero
20:44 - width zero
20:46 - uh border solid 10 pixels
20:50 - triple three doing this because i'm
20:52 - using borders for this
20:54 - and let's save that and see what it is
20:56 - so there we go we have a 10 pixel border
20:59 - that is 333 the color of the background
21:01 - so it looks it's gonna look like it's
21:03 - see-through the it's gonna look like
21:05 - we're creating those triangles so we
21:06 - have a square in order to create a
21:08 - triangle out of the border we need to
21:10 - remove the one of the sides so that you
21:12 - can see through it to see the red so
21:14 - watch this we're going to go border
21:17 - top
21:18 - color
21:20 - transparent
21:24 - and save that
21:25 - so okay now you can't really see
21:27 - anything there we're going to move it
21:28 - down to the bottom we're going to say
21:29 - bottom negative 10 pixels let's go
21:31 - bottom 0 to see where it is there it is
21:33 - but we want him to beat that to be down
21:35 - more so negative 10 pixels is the height
21:37 - of that element
21:40 - that should do the trick so there we go
21:42 - so we got one there but now we need to
21:44 - do a couple more so you can see how this
21:46 - is working as pac-man passes through him
21:48 - you can actually see where it's
21:50 - where it is okay
21:52 - so now what we need to do is simply
21:55 - uh style so we styled skirt with that
21:58 - style but now we're going to style the
21:59 - before and after
22:01 - virtual elements
22:02 - as well
22:04 - before
22:06 - and skirt
22:08 - after
22:09 - and now we're going to do is again
22:10 - content
22:12 - position at absolute
22:15 - height zero width zero
22:18 - border is gonna be solid 10 pixels
22:20 - triple three
22:23 - come to think of it i could have just
22:25 - styled this in a much more efficient
22:27 - manner why don't i go like this
22:30 - i'm gonna copy that i'm gonna remove all
22:32 - these styles for now
22:34 - i'm gonna paste this right there
22:37 - so all those have that style
22:40 - and i'm gonna move these slightly in a
22:43 - sec so save that check it out in the
22:45 - browser
22:46 - okay so you can't see them there because
22:47 - they're all stacked on top of one
22:48 - another so now all we got to do is style
22:50 - each of these individually so i'm going
22:51 - to split these out okay so now we're
22:54 - going to say before
22:55 - is going to have a left
22:59 - position of
23:01 - 10 pixels gonna move over 10 pixels and
23:04 - then the after is going to be moved
23:06 - over uh left 30 pixels
23:10 - save it let's check it out
23:12 - okay you don't see it because
23:15 - these actually have to have these are
23:17 - virtual elements so they have to have a
23:19 - content
23:21 - so simply all we're gonna do here is uh
23:25 - content empty string copy that
23:28 - after this is gonna have content empty
23:30 - string save that bam there it is just
23:32 - like that so now we have the three
23:34 - little uh
23:36 - skirt
23:38 - frills
23:40 - uh
23:41 - that
23:42 - make up this ghost so now this ghost
23:44 - looks done so now all we gotta do is
23:46 - move the ghost google his eyes and flash
23:50 - his color
23:53 - we already created the move animation so
23:55 - let's just move him
23:58 - uh so let's see what happens if we go
23:59 - back up to
24:01 - the
24:02 - ghost right here and wait here it is and
24:07 - let's give him the animation
24:09 - of
24:10 - animation
24:11 - move forward
24:13 - five seconds linear
24:15 - infinite
24:17 - save that and let's see what happens
24:19 - okay he's moving but where's pac-man
24:22 - pac-man is hiding directly behind him so
24:24 - that's a problem we need to separate
24:26 - them so what i'm going to do is just
24:29 - simply delay how long
24:31 - pac-man takes
24:33 - until he starts his animation
24:35 - you don't have to do anything really
24:36 - extra you just go up to pac-man
24:39 - and let me see here animation
24:42 - let's just have another line here called
24:44 - animation delay
24:47 - i'm going to delay him 0.8 seconds you
24:50 - can delete him however long you want
24:52 - and it will space him out from the ghost
24:54 - watch this
24:56 - okay
24:57 - do you see what has happened now they're
24:58 - spaced apart but when i refreshed look
25:01 - where pac-man was he was just sitting
25:02 - there and then he disappeared off the
25:04 - screen negative 20 and then started his
25:06 - animation that looks bad so all we have
25:08 - to do is move pac-man by default
25:12 - 20
25:13 - left off the screen so he's just going
25:14 - to be
25:15 - left negative 20
25:18 - save that
25:19 - now when he's waiting for his animation
25:22 - he's going to be off the screen and then
25:23 - he's going to come out
25:25 - so now perfect so now if i delay this
25:27 - longer like say two seconds
25:30 - these are going to be spaced apart a lot
25:32 - more
25:34 - like that
25:36 - and now looks like the ghost is chasing
25:37 - him i mean maybe that's fun maybe that's
25:39 - a cool way of doing it maybe you want to
25:40 - delay like 2.5 seconds
25:43 - see what that looks like
25:44 - halfway it's coming out and that looks
25:47 - like the ghost is chasing him
25:49 - and now like he's chasing the go
25:50 - whatever you want to do works totally
25:52 - fine i'm going to leave mine with
25:53 - something like maybe one second for now
25:56 - okay
25:57 - now
25:58 - the ghost needs to um
26:00 - let's make him
26:01 - [Music]
26:02 - flash let's make him blink
26:06 - blinky all right let's scroll down to
26:09 - the ghost
26:10 - we're going to create an animation
26:12 - called color swap or blink maybe you
26:15 - want to call it blink whatever works for
26:17 - you so let's go back to the ghosts and
26:20 - let's give him an animation so we did
26:21 - move forward but we're actually going to
26:22 - do another one you can do a comma and
26:24 - add another animation very easily just
26:26 - like this so we're going to say
26:28 - um
26:29 - you could say color swap like this you
26:31 - can call it
26:32 - blink you know blink is kind of a fun
26:34 - one
26:36 - blinky sure let's call it that
26:38 - and we're gonna say 0.5 seconds
26:41 - uh is how long it will take linear is
26:43 - the is the arc
26:45 - and infinite we're going to have it
26:47 - happen forever
26:48 - so save that uh we need to actually
26:50 - create that animation now called blinky
26:52 - so go down create a keyframe call it
26:56 - blinky
26:58 - and all we're going to do for blinky for
27:01 - swapping the color is halfway through
27:02 - the animation timeline change the
27:04 - background to hot pink
27:07 - halfway through it's going to swap to
27:09 - hot pink and then swap back to its other
27:11 - color so save that check it out so now
27:14 - he's blinking and you can change that
27:16 - color to whatever you want you can
27:17 - change it to i don't know like
27:19 - triple three i don't know what's going
27:20 - to happen
27:22 - looks like he kind of like disappears
27:23 - into the
27:24 - into the background which is kind of
27:26 - cool i kind of like that and maybe if i
27:28 - sped up the animation time i don't know
27:31 - like 0.2 seconds let's see what happens
27:35 - you know that's something
27:37 - 0.4 seconds let's see
27:39 - yeah i like that one that looks fun
27:41 - but you can have whatever color swap you
27:43 - want
27:44 - and um okay so that's good now what we
27:47 - got to do is we've got to make his eyes
27:50 - move back and forth so we got to make
27:51 - those little peepers uh move left and
27:54 - right
27:55 - so
27:56 - what we're going to do is go to the
27:59 - ghosts
28:00 - pupils which are eyes
28:04 - okay
28:05 - and let's
28:06 - go with before and after and we're going
28:09 - to say animation
28:11 - we're going to start with peeper left so
28:13 - the left peeper
28:14 - 0.7 seconds linear
28:17 - infinite again
28:20 - okay and now the we have to create an
28:22 - animation called paper left
28:26 - and so now if we just started with that
28:28 - let's go down the bottom create a
28:29 - keyframe
28:31 - called
28:32 - keyframes
28:33 - paper left and then what we're going to
28:35 - do with paper left
28:37 - is
28:38 - at zero percent comma and 100 percent so
28:42 - the left position of that is gonna be
28:43 - five pixels and that's because the
28:44 - position of the left eyeball is actually
28:48 - five pixels so i want it to be at its
28:50 - five pixel default state and then move
28:53 - over a little bit so let's move it over
28:56 - uh people left at the 50
28:59 - mark of the timeline i wanted to move
29:01 - over
29:02 - left let's move it over a little bit so
29:05 - sorry not that long i want it to be 10
29:06 - pixels
29:08 - over so if i save that we've already got
29:10 - that set up refresh so now you see how
29:13 - that eyeball is going back and forth but
29:15 - now the the right eyeball is not there
29:18 - so that's because it's getting the same
29:21 - animation as the left peeper so we want
29:24 - to separate that and have it have its
29:26 - own animation so while we're down here
29:28 - let's copy this
29:30 - and do another keyframe called peeper
29:33 - right
29:34 - and the left
29:36 - the zero and 100 percent part of the
29:38 - timeline is going to be 30 pixels from
29:40 - the left because that is the default
29:43 - state of the right eyeball
29:45 - up here you can see i after left 30
29:48 - pixels so we want it to start there and
29:51 - then move over probably 8 pixels and
29:53 - then do that so let's scroll back down
29:55 - to paper right the left position won't
29:57 - be ten percent uh save this actually
29:59 - we're gonna have to add that style uh so
30:02 - copy paper left on this one and and the
30:04 - after add paper
30:06 - right save that and watch what happens
30:09 - right here so that's super weird
30:11 - unless that's the style you're going for
30:13 - but obviously it's not what we're going
30:14 - for so paper right the the 50 mark the
30:18 - left position
30:19 - make it 38
30:20 - pixels so now they're going roughly the
30:22 - same you can see they're both
30:24 - they're off a little bit so maybe
30:26 - if i did this 35 pixels it's going to be
30:28 - the same distance so they're both going
30:29 - to move exactly the same
30:31 - way
30:33 - so now they're moving at exactly a
30:35 - uniform speed and distance and pace
30:38 - they're identical
30:39 - but if you want to give them a little
30:40 - bit more of a googly googly eye look you
30:43 - can have it move
30:44 - a little bit few more pixels so now they
30:46 - look a little bit
30:48 - you know a little bit more googly
30:49 - looking
30:52 - yeah
30:54 - interesting up to you however you want
30:56 - to do it you can even go something like
30:58 - this like top
31:00 - i don't know i don't know what's going
31:01 - to happen here what's the top uh the top
31:05 - by default for this is 25 pixels so
31:08 - maybe we move it to
31:11 - 20 pixels
31:13 - let's see what happens
31:15 - so that eyeball is like doing like a
31:17 - little
31:18 - it's kind of cool
31:21 - i'm gonna take that out okay save that
31:24 - and
31:25 - really
31:26 - refresh that's it
31:28 - so we have our pac-man
31:31 - chomping moving along the top the path
31:33 - going off screen coming back out from
31:35 - the beginning we have our blinky ghost
31:37 - all css flashing
31:40 - moving and his eyeballs are moving back
31:43 - and forth
31:44 - and that is really
31:47 - cool that's really quite something
31:49 - that's it for today this was a big
31:52 - lesson
31:53 - but i really enjoyed making this so i
31:55 - really wanted to give it the time of day
31:56 - so that you can
31:58 - create something really interesting show
32:00 - your friends show your mom and uh
32:03 - they'll really think you're cool that
32:04 - you spent a lot of time
32:07 - on your computer making pacman
32:09 - [Music]
32:14 - john

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up welcome back to css3 at 30 days today we are going to be doing something really fun and that is creating a pacman animation we're going to make a little pacman chasing the blinky ghost across the screen and it's gonna be a lot of fun now what is pacman uh if you don't know what pacman is then google it i don't know anyone who doesn't know what pacman is pacman is a classic arcade game it's timeless it's a little yellow chomping uh ball that eats little pebbles along this maze and there's ghosts chasing him and when he gets a special pebble he gets to chase the ghosts and eat the ghosts and get bonus points really fun simple little game and we're just going to create a nice simple animation of pacman moving along a pat moving along a path chasing the ghost so check this out in my browser and i'm going to show you what we're making check it out right here here it is now there are a number of things going on here all of this this entire thing is css just css there's no javascript nothing like that it's purely css animations and css3 and that's what's exciting about it so let's check out what's going on here we have the path in the background with these little pebbles it's very simple it looks like he's eating them we also have a circle here and that circle is chomping and moving as well so a couple things there then we have this ghost blinky what blinky is doing is uh quite literally blinking colors so he's moving along the timeline as well along the path and he's blinking colors in and out from red to hot pink and he also has big googly eyes and his pupils are moving back and forth so he's got a number of things going on i haven't seen a css tutorial online yet other than this one where they code the ghost as well i've only seen css pacman animations in varying degrees uh in different examples but i haven't seen one with the ghost so i wanted to throw the ghost in here because it's kind of exciting all right so let's get coding let's make our pacman and let's make our goats and let's animate them right now so jump over here in your code editor download 17 pacman you got the three files there again give you a moment to download those files and come right back here and and then i'm going to show you what's going on here so we've got our index file with some markup and i'm going to show you what's going on in terms of the html this is what the html looks like for the pacman we have a div with the class of path wraps everything that is the container which is simply that black path right here with the dots inside then we have div with the class of pacman that is pacman that's it for pacman then we have a div the class of ghost which wraps uh a div with the class of eyes and div with the class of skirt so the eyes are the eyes and the pupils the skirt is the the bottom of the ghost those triangles that look like a skirt so and that's it for the markup you don't have to code it because it's already there this isn't an html course it's a css course but just to show you how simple the html is and all the magic happens in css jump into your sandbox okay so let's get started let's jump in and say we're going to start with path and that path is going to be a position of relative a width of 100 a height of 100 pixels a background of triple three but whatever color you want it to be works as well padding 20 pixels all around box sizing i want to be border box because i want it to be a fixed 100 pixel height if i don't declare border box i'm going to have 140 pixel height element because the padding adds to that height so i want it to be border box to keep that padding within it so the element is 100 pixels height max overflow hidden very important because when the ghost when blinky and pacman go off the screen out of the element i want them to disappear not slide outside and be visible and be kind of odd it would look like a little glitch so that's it for the path save that check it out here in the browser it's just gonna be a big long um like a dark gray rectangle all right jump back in here i'm just gonna tab in one and say path virtual element after content empty string position relative note position absolute okay display block border top 12 pixels dotted white what we're making here are those little pebbles along the middle of the path now if i say width 90 i have to give it a width because of the condition that it's in it's an after virtual element that you cannot see until you give a width and or a height so we got the width uh and the height is the 12 pixels of the top border so simply i'm creating an element that is just a top border the width is 90 if we save that and check it out here in the browser we've got it right here we've got our 12 pixel dotted border we've got our 20 pixel padding on the left and the top as you can see very clearly the problem is is that this is not centered within the path vertically or horizontally so let's deal with that right now over here in the code editor simply going to say top 50 that's going to push it down 50 percent of the height of that parent element and left five percent because we are ninety percent width if we want to fill a 100 width if we push it over five percent there's also five percent on the other side so now we're perfectly centered in terms of the top fifty percent we're going to have a little problem save that check it out it's perfectly centered horizontally but we've got too much space in the top that's because it's going 50 percent down from the top of this element so this actually here to here is exactly 50 but i want it to be 50 from the center of these these uh dots because those dots are 12 pixels in height half of that if we bring it up half of those pixels it's going to be perfectly centered so margin top negative 6 pixels save that bam now we are perfectly centered both vertically and horizontally all right now let's get down to the fun stuff let let's create pacman there's pacman we're gonna say position absolute zed index 99 so he's always on top of everything top 50 we want him down 50 from the top of the the path and now um that's it for now now you're not going to see pacman because he is simply just a position a zindex and a top value there's nothing showing us visually that it's pacman where that's going to come into play is the before and after virtual elements so let's go down and style those up we're going to say pacman before and pacman after in here we're going to give him content of an empty string display block and we're going to say height 0 width 0 this is weird why are we doing this well we're actually going to create pacman out of a border not actually out of creating a background color okay so we're gonna say position absolute and then we're gonna go border solid 30 pixels yellow that save that check it out in the browser it's going to give us a yellow square and that's because we have we have a 60 by 60 element because there's uh there's a border top there's a border left there's a border bottom and there's a border right of 30 pixels so now what we're going to do is we're going to remove certain sides of the border in order to give us the illusion or make it look like we have half circles now what do i mean by half circles i'm styling both before and after with these identical styles so there are two elements on top of each other if i move one over say pacman after and i give him margin left of like like 65 pixels save that check it out in the browser i moved him over just enough so you can see there's two and so now now we're gonna leave it like that for now and then style it up so you can see what they both look like let's go back here to before and after and let's say margin top i want it to be negative 30 pixels so he's centered in that path border radius 100 should do the trick or 50 50 is fine should give us a perfect circle if i save that and check it out in the browser we got two perfect circles sitting in the middle of the path now let's remove some sides of the border border right color transparent save that check it out so i removed the right border of the four sides and now it actually looks like pacman we're not going to stop there because we actually want two parts to this pacman a top part and a bottom part and we're gonna make those chomp together in this manner i don't really know if i were just to have one chunk out of one side of a circle i don't really know how to connect those in an animation but what we can do is create two of these elements and animate them individually so it looks like there's a chomping animation this method specifically i'm going to give credit to travis nielsen of dev tips in his css animations tutorials on youtube check him out uh he created a pacman loader and he did basically pacman he called him a chomper chomp chomp and um he used the before and after virtual elements and animated those individually so uh i am going to give credit where credit is due this specific part is uh inspired by travis so thank you for that um the rest of it however is a mishmash of me just jamming and trying to figure out how to make this work so let's show you what's going on border right color we're also going to say border bottom color is transparent now watch what happens save that check it out bam now we've got two half circles because we cut out two parts of the border but now what we're going to do is make the the after virtual element uh have kind of an inverted version of that so we can you'll see what i mean so let's give the after pseudo element the border color of yellow to reset it back to a circle there it is now what we're going to do is say border right color is transparent and the border top color is transparent as well if i save that and check it out now we got the other side now this will make a lot more sense if i remove this margin left of pacman after and now they're connected and they look like a pacman all we have to do now is animate those two separately to rotate a certain amount of degrees on both sides so it looks like a chomper let's do that right now so simply go up to the pacman before after and we're going to give it an animation so animation we're going to name it mouth top and we're gonna do it over 0.7 seconds ease infinitely infinite save that it's not going to work until we define a keyframe so go to the bottom and add your keyframes at the bottom of your style sheet that's usually a good place to do it keyframes this one's called mouth top and now it's just simply playing with timelines so we're going to say at the 50 point of the timeline so this goes from 0 to one hundred percent you can also define it based on uh seconds i believe but anyway we got fifty percent way through the animation we are going to say transform this is just css rotate i'm going to say 44 degrees specifically chose that number for a reason i'll show you why save that refresh in your browser now it's all rotating 44 degrees but i want the bottom mouth to rotate negative 44 degrees so that one goes up rather than down as well so simply all we have to do is well while we're down here in the keyframes let's define another keyframe copy this one in fact save you some typing paste it call it mouth bottom rotate it negative 44 degrees scroll up to your before and after copy this style right here paste it in the after pseudo element style and change the name to mouth bottom same exact animation just inverted save it check it on the browser bam just like that chomping perfectly now why did i choose 44 well let me show you what happens when i do 46 degrees look at the back end the rear end of pacman there's a little bit of a oops a little bit of a line that appears there and that's not okay 45 degrees shows the same hair line just a little smaller 44 degrees was the perfect number where i found no line at all where the mouth closed the most okay now all we have to do is move him so let's create another keyframe here and let's call it keyframes move forward and i'm just going to say at zero percent uh of the animation i want pacman to be negative 20 position i'll show you why in a moment and at 100 i want him to be at left 100 so that the left side of pacman is going to be 100 so he's going to be off of the screen so if i save this and move up to pacman give this an animation of animation we called it move forward five seconds linear and infinite save that check it out in the browser watch what happens see how he's coming out from off of the screen on the left side and then disappears on the right that's exactly what we want let me show you in that keyframe what happens if the left is actually zero percent what you might think he starts his left side of the element starts right here so he goes off screen but then just appears out of nowhere and it's not smooth but if we have it left negative 20 where we know he's off the screen that's gonna solve the problem he slides out so he goes off the screen like that comes back out gently i like it you might even sample 10 and see what happens there if you wanted you could play around with a number maybe that looks a bit more like he's half off there and half coming out that works too so that's it for move forward now that's it for pacman actually so we made a pacman animation i could have left it here but i thought nah i wanna make a ghost and i wanna make that ghost run so let's do that and now we're gonna start styling up this ghost okay so now we're gonna say ghosts should have just called him boo ghost position absolute zed index 99 so he's on top of the screen as well top 50 left twenty percent i'm doing that because i want him in front of pacman i'll show you i'll show you a bit here margin top we're gonna bring him up negative 35 pixels because i want the height to be 70 pixels in height and the width to be 60 pixels in width so margin top is half of 70 so that it's perfectly aligned vertically in the center if i save that and go back here you actually won't see anything because we haven't given him any colors so let's go back to the ghost here again let's go background red let's get make him red save that now check out your browser so we've got a rectangle a red rectangle so now we just need to shape him out so let's say the border top uh the border top left radius is 70 pixels and the border top right radius is 70 pixels watch what happens just the top rounds out the top left the top right that looks nice and now let's start shaping him out a little bit more he needs to have that skirt and the eyes so let's let's use as minimal amount of markup as possible and let's say uh goes before now what we're going to do is say goes before and then ghost after and now we're going to use this use the ghost before and after for the the googly eyes the the the white part of his eyes or her eyes content uh empty string position absolute background white height 25 pixels and width 20 pixels i want them to be not a perfect circle i want them to be like a long like a long eyeball border radius uh we're going to make that 100 perfectly round uh rounded edges all over the place save it let's check it out see what happened here so we have the right shape i think that's the shape i want both of them are right there they're stacked on top of one another so we're going to have to move that so go back here in your code editor and let's simply say top 15 pixels from the top and then left we're going to go four pixels from the left now really i'm just styling this is where i want the before i to be i want the after eye to be over a bit so simply go down here we're going to declare a ghost after pseudo elements virtual element you know what i mean and we're just going to say left 28 pixels that's the only thing we need to change save that check it out we've got our two white eyes starting to come together it looks pretty cool all right now let's style those eyes so i have an element called eyes in the markup but i want to use the before and after virtual elements as well so we're going to go eyes before and eyes after okay now again as usual content empty string so it can be visible on the screen position absolute so we can move it around wherever we want it outside of the flow of the document background blue we want blue eyes heights 10 pixels so these are the pupils i probably could have called these pupils but oh well width 10 pixels border radius 100 that's border radius 100 and uh save that let's see what's happening okay so there's our little blue eye up there we need to move it down and over a bit so back here top 25 pixels and left 5 pixels save that there it is looks good i don't think i need to do anything else with that one now i just need to move the second eye the after uh virtual element over so i'm going to say eyes after and left is going to be 30 pixels and that will move him over to the right spot i believe save that refresh uh it's i don't i don't see it i think this is a zindex problem go back here and both of them going to say that index 99 again save that bam there it is it was just hidden behind the i you couldn't see it so i needed to move that pupil forward using zindex that was important okay now uh we have one more thing to do here with the the look of this little blinky is the skirt is what i called it so let's go down another style here oops not there let's do it after the eyes and let's go skirt position whoops let's go position absolute height zero width zero uh border solid 10 pixels triple three doing this because i'm using borders for this and let's save that and see what it is so there we go we have a 10 pixel border that is 333 the color of the background so it looks it's gonna look like it's seethrough the it's gonna look like we're creating those triangles so we have a square in order to create a triangle out of the border we need to remove the one of the sides so that you can see through it to see the red so watch this we're going to go border top color transparent and save that so okay now you can't really see anything there we're going to move it down to the bottom we're going to say bottom negative 10 pixels let's go bottom 0 to see where it is there it is but we want him to beat that to be down more so negative 10 pixels is the height of that element that should do the trick so there we go so we got one there but now we need to do a couple more so you can see how this is working as pacman passes through him you can actually see where it's where it is okay so now what we need to do is simply uh style so we styled skirt with that style but now we're going to style the before and after virtual elements as well before and skirt after and now we're going to do is again content position at absolute height zero width zero border is gonna be solid 10 pixels triple three come to think of it i could have just styled this in a much more efficient manner why don't i go like this i'm gonna copy that i'm gonna remove all these styles for now i'm gonna paste this right there so all those have that style and i'm gonna move these slightly in a sec so save that check it out in the browser okay so you can't see them there because they're all stacked on top of one another so now all we got to do is style each of these individually so i'm going to split these out okay so now we're going to say before is going to have a left position of 10 pixels gonna move over 10 pixels and then the after is going to be moved over uh left 30 pixels save it let's check it out okay you don't see it because these actually have to have these are virtual elements so they have to have a content so simply all we're gonna do here is uh content empty string copy that after this is gonna have content empty string save that bam there it is just like that so now we have the three little uh skirt frills uh that make up this ghost so now this ghost looks done so now all we gotta do is move the ghost google his eyes and flash his color we already created the move animation so let's just move him uh so let's see what happens if we go back up to the ghost right here and wait here it is and let's give him the animation of animation move forward five seconds linear infinite save that and let's see what happens okay he's moving but where's pacman pacman is hiding directly behind him so that's a problem we need to separate them so what i'm going to do is just simply delay how long pacman takes until he starts his animation you don't have to do anything really extra you just go up to pacman and let me see here animation let's just have another line here called animation delay i'm going to delay him 0.8 seconds you can delete him however long you want and it will space him out from the ghost watch this okay do you see what has happened now they're spaced apart but when i refreshed look where pacman was he was just sitting there and then he disappeared off the screen negative 20 and then started his animation that looks bad so all we have to do is move pacman by default 20 left off the screen so he's just going to be left negative 20 save that now when he's waiting for his animation he's going to be off the screen and then he's going to come out so now perfect so now if i delay this longer like say two seconds these are going to be spaced apart a lot more like that and now looks like the ghost is chasing him i mean maybe that's fun maybe that's a cool way of doing it maybe you want to delay like 2.5 seconds see what that looks like halfway it's coming out and that looks like the ghost is chasing him and now like he's chasing the go whatever you want to do works totally fine i'm going to leave mine with something like maybe one second for now okay now the ghost needs to um let's make him flash let's make him blink blinky all right let's scroll down to the ghost we're going to create an animation called color swap or blink maybe you want to call it blink whatever works for you so let's go back to the ghosts and let's give him an animation so we did move forward but we're actually going to do another one you can do a comma and add another animation very easily just like this so we're going to say um you could say color swap like this you can call it blink you know blink is kind of a fun one blinky sure let's call it that and we're gonna say 0.5 seconds uh is how long it will take linear is the is the arc and infinite we're going to have it happen forever so save that uh we need to actually create that animation now called blinky so go down create a keyframe call it blinky and all we're going to do for blinky for swapping the color is halfway through the animation timeline change the background to hot pink halfway through it's going to swap to hot pink and then swap back to its other color so save that check it out so now he's blinking and you can change that color to whatever you want you can change it to i don't know like triple three i don't know what's going to happen looks like he kind of like disappears into the into the background which is kind of cool i kind of like that and maybe if i sped up the animation time i don't know like 0.2 seconds let's see what happens you know that's something 0.4 seconds let's see yeah i like that one that looks fun but you can have whatever color swap you want and um okay so that's good now what we got to do is we've got to make his eyes move back and forth so we got to make those little peepers uh move left and right so what we're going to do is go to the ghosts pupils which are eyes okay and let's go with before and after and we're going to say animation we're going to start with peeper left so the left peeper 0.7 seconds linear infinite again okay and now the we have to create an animation called paper left and so now if we just started with that let's go down the bottom create a keyframe called keyframes paper left and then what we're going to do with paper left is at zero percent comma and 100 percent so the left position of that is gonna be five pixels and that's because the position of the left eyeball is actually five pixels so i want it to be at its five pixel default state and then move over a little bit so let's move it over uh people left at the 50 mark of the timeline i wanted to move over left let's move it over a little bit so sorry not that long i want it to be 10 pixels over so if i save that we've already got that set up refresh so now you see how that eyeball is going back and forth but now the the right eyeball is not there so that's because it's getting the same animation as the left peeper so we want to separate that and have it have its own animation so while we're down here let's copy this and do another keyframe called peeper right and the left the zero and 100 percent part of the timeline is going to be 30 pixels from the left because that is the default state of the right eyeball up here you can see i after left 30 pixels so we want it to start there and then move over probably 8 pixels and then do that so let's scroll back down to paper right the left position won't be ten percent uh save this actually we're gonna have to add that style uh so copy paper left on this one and and the after add paper right save that and watch what happens right here so that's super weird unless that's the style you're going for but obviously it's not what we're going for so paper right the the 50 mark the left position make it 38 pixels so now they're going roughly the same you can see they're both they're off a little bit so maybe if i did this 35 pixels it's going to be the same distance so they're both going to move exactly the same way so now they're moving at exactly a uniform speed and distance and pace they're identical but if you want to give them a little bit more of a googly googly eye look you can have it move a little bit few more pixels so now they look a little bit you know a little bit more googly looking yeah interesting up to you however you want to do it you can even go something like this like top i don't know i don't know what's going to happen here what's the top uh the top by default for this is 25 pixels so maybe we move it to 20 pixels let's see what happens so that eyeball is like doing like a little it's kind of cool i'm gonna take that out okay save that and really refresh that's it so we have our pacman chomping moving along the top the path going off screen coming back out from the beginning we have our blinky ghost all css flashing moving and his eyeballs are moving back and forth and that is really cool that's really quite something that's it for today this was a big lesson but i really enjoyed making this so i really wanted to give it the time of day so that you can create something really interesting show your friends show your mom and uh they'll really think you're cool that you spent a lot of time on your computer making pacman john
