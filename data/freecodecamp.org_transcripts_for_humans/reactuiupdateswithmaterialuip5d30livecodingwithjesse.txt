With timestamps:

00:03 - everybody welcome to the live coding
00:06 - with Jesse today we're gonna switch
00:08 - things up a little bit from what we've
00:10 - been doing this week and we're gonna get
00:12 - back and do some UI work we'll work a
00:15 - little bit with CSS and with the
00:17 - material UI components so I noticed in
00:21 - yesterday's stream when we were bringing
00:24 - in some of the data we tried to look at
00:26 - the pages and some of the data was
00:29 - hidden because we were pulling in the
00:32 - styles for another page so it occurred
00:37 - to me after the stream that of course
00:39 - we're pulling in those Styles right
00:41 - because we copied and pasted everything
00:44 - from the other page into that new
00:46 - component so we're still importing those
00:49 - same styles so I thought you know the
00:52 - first thing that we ought to do today is
00:54 - go through and maybe strip out the more
00:58 - specific styles and have maybe one style
01:04 - sheet that has some of the more you know
01:08 - basic things that would be Universal you
01:10 - know across all the pages and then I'll
01:14 - test out some of those pages that didn't
01:17 - look right yesterday see if they look
01:19 - all right and we can always make is we
01:24 - can make adjustments for specific cases
01:27 - you know as we see them but so far most
01:31 - of the page have been looking alright so
01:33 - I don't think we'll need to adjust too
01:34 - much I think it's I don't have a live
01:40 - setup yet so let me get this ready
01:46 - alright hey everybody
01:54 - okay
02:04 - all right so I guess we'll get started
02:05 - everything looks good with the stream
02:07 - whatever changes I have made in the OBS
02:10 - settings at the beginning of the week I
02:13 - think that really did the trick we've
02:14 - had no trouble at all with the stream
02:16 - quality so that's that's good
02:18 - there was a while there or I just wasn't
02:21 - sure what it was gonna be like and it's
02:26 - Sneaky's birthday today
02:28 - happy birthday so Nikki or rook from the
02:33 - live chat is it's actually here for the
02:37 - stream for that's really cool that
02:41 - you're watching on your birthday so
02:43 - happy birthday again all right now y'all
02:54 - can see my screen so I was doing some
02:56 - data migration so that's why I'm here in
02:58 - our migrate jas file I'm gonna switch
03:00 - over though and show you let's see I
03:09 - make it a bit bigger for you all let's
03:13 - shrink this down and let's bring up the
03:15 - N grog server because in when we're
03:19 - doing things like this I think and rock
03:21 - is really helpful because I'll probably
03:23 - be looking at my dev tools and so if you
03:28 - can look you know on your screen as well
03:31 - it's a lot nicer alright so I am going
03:36 - to paste this in
03:42 - all right so now that links that link is
03:46 - available and you all can see the same
03:51 - site that I'm looking at that I'm
03:52 - running locally all right now this is
03:56 - our page J s component which we made and
03:59 - it's supposed to be just a component
04:04 - that can be used for a variety of
04:06 - content types
04:07 - so that's all the problem for us of you
04:10 - know we were making new components for
04:12 - every content type and we're starting to
04:14 - get a lot of types and a lot of
04:16 - components so this will save us a lot of
04:18 - time and clean things up it works but
04:21 - you can see here that we are bringing in
04:25 - the news CSS so news dot CSS so let's
04:31 - let's try to create a new CSS page now
04:35 - the reason we're not using something
04:37 - more like styled components or anything
04:39 - is because we're bringing in a large
04:42 - chunk of HTML from our database for now
04:47 - that's the way we have to do it
04:49 - eventually we can do something different
04:52 - with it but right now there's not enough
04:55 - time to get all that data reformatted so
04:58 - we're just bringing in the HTML as is
05:00 - because of that we need to use style
05:03 - sheets right I can't go in and add a
05:06 - class to something in here because the
05:10 - data is coming from here right I don't
05:12 - really know what's gonna be there you
05:14 - know to add a class to so we're just
05:18 - going to do our best to set up styles
05:22 - that are most likely to look good over a
05:24 - variety of types and then hopefully we
05:27 - can test enough pages to catch most of
05:30 - the cases this is a very large site
05:34 - thousands of pages so as long as we
05:39 - cover the pages that are most frequently
05:41 - viewed and I'll probably check the
05:43 - analytics here soon not during the
05:45 - stream but I mean you know within the
05:47 - next week or so just to double-check
05:49 - make sure that the pages that get
05:51 - visited the most or where we we spend
05:54 - the most
05:59 - looks like Nikki's getting errors in the
06:03 - console what it's your birthday you
06:05 - shouldn't get errors on it for your
06:07 - birthday
06:08 - let's check this out and see see if I'm
06:12 - getting any errors as well I'm getting
06:17 - some kind of errors let me refresh this
06:19 - and see I'm getting all right so here's
06:29 - what I'm getting in terms of errors I
06:34 - mean I can still see everything oh here
06:40 - we are
06:40 - mm-hmm we have have this one that
06:45 - unexpected whoops
06:49 - you know what I've seen errors like that
06:52 - before I can't remember what they were
06:55 - though oh you know it was it just that
06:57 - page let me go back this axis you know
07:05 - it's not Texas vanishing avoiding a
07:08 - connection yeah
07:14 - all right that's odd it must be there
07:17 - must be something going on with what
07:19 - we're bringing in here on this page
07:21 - because it's not happening
07:22 - you know in this page well we'll see
07:30 - we'll give it a minute maybe we'll get
07:31 - it but it mm-hmm
07:34 - yeah we are getting it here on this page
07:36 - as well so I'm not really sure what the
07:38 - problem is obviously it's not affecting
07:42 - you know the view of things and we'll
07:46 - just we'll keep an eye on that
07:52 - all right what was I gonna totally have
07:58 - just lost what I was gonna do now I I
08:03 - think I was gonna make a new CSS file I
08:07 - think that's what I was talking about
08:08 - all right so let's see our static folder
08:14 - so within our static folder let's make a
08:17 - new file and we'll name it pick page CSS
08:25 - so if you notice the pattern we're
08:28 - naming our fight our CSS files the same
08:30 - name as the component that they go with
08:32 - and we're doing the same thing with our
08:34 - queries we name our queries our graph QL
08:37 - queries the same name as the component
08:40 - that they go with so it can be a bit
08:44 - confusing when we have pages here like a
08:46 - page a s and a page a s so there are
08:51 - downsides to doing it like that but also
08:53 - there's no confusion about which things
08:56 - go together all right so since we have
09:01 - this component here with nothing in it
09:03 - we need to bring some things in so I'm
09:05 - going to pull in now let me compare here
09:11 - the Faculty CSS and the new CSS
09:20 - hmm
09:36 - I think I'm going to bring in the
09:38 - faculty CSS because it does not have one
09:45 - problematic piece which is the
09:47 - display:none for their route component
09:51 - so let's try that out first and we'll
09:54 - see how it looks
09:56 - weird my they get closed out my new file
10:02 - here there we are
10:03 - alright I'm going to save that and then
10:06 - in our page das component
10:09 - let's bring in instead of news spring in
10:13 - our page dot CSS file okay so now that
10:17 - saves let's check it out and refresh all
10:24 - right so for this particular page
10:26 - everything looks fine I'd like to go
10:29 - back to that page that was giving us the
10:31 - issues and you know what I'm gonna make
10:34 - this bigger I'm gonna make this 150 it
10:37 - should be a little easier to see
10:39 - 150% of what I set the screen to I have
10:43 - this set to 320 pixels because as far as
10:47 - I know that is the minimum screen width
10:51 - in pixels that that's available right
10:54 - now for a mobile device so we don't have
10:58 - to worry about anything below that which
11:01 - is good because the the menu here just
11:04 - barely fits we may have to make the menu
11:06 - a little bit more narrow but any less
11:09 - than that you wouldn't really be able to
11:10 - shock the menu all right so let me think
11:15 - about all right if I hit back we'll find
11:18 - it because I don't remember exactly what
11:23 - with the page was
11:32 - our mission
11:34 - [Music]
11:39 - okay just you know kind of quickly
11:42 - glancing this is looking pretty good I
11:46 - don't see okay you know there's nothing
11:51 - really standing out is this looks awful
11:55 - of course if there happens to be some
11:58 - data that's completely missing here you
12:01 - know because it's hidden or something I
12:03 - won't really know about that let's go
12:09 - back hopefully we have something it's
12:14 - just the film studies minor alright that
12:19 - wasn't the one that didn't work
12:21 - hurry come on alright so I can't
12:27 - remember which one didn't work if
12:28 - anybody remembers which one didn't work
12:29 - let me know in the live chat otherwise
12:31 - I'm gonna try to refresh my memory by
12:35 - looking at our post types
12:51 - her shirt says academics there was a
12:54 - page in academics that didn't work all
12:58 - right let me check what content we have
13:00 - in academics right now to see if I can
13:01 - remember what it was
13:17 - I don't remember what it was I don't
13:19 - know why I really should have tried
13:28 - harder to remember that
13:38 - good have I don't know who we even have
13:41 - a academics page in our history here no
13:46 - okay
13:52 - the harsh it says it was academics
13:55 - English okay let's try that then
14:10 - let me see
14:40 - actually no I don't have any content for
14:44 - English under academics if it was
14:47 - English maybe it was under something
14:51 - else under departments maybe - I have a
14:54 - departments for English
15:10 - all right let's see we have for the
15:15 - English department I don't think it was
15:19 - that the I don't remember ever trying to
15:22 - look at that mm-hmm archers let's view
15:30 - recording a previous dream yeah I know I
15:32 - can do that I just don't
15:36 - alright let's let's do some inception
15:39 - style stuff here let's view the previous
15:45 - stream alright so hopefully we don't
15:54 - cause anything crazy to happen let me
16:01 - try to see a messed up screen there it
16:04 - is
16:06 - Austria that's what I have academics
16:09 - Austria courses offered alright that was
16:13 - way easier than I thought it would be
16:18 - oops
16:19 - I moved the wrong thing alright let's
16:24 - check that out there we are
16:31 - alright still can't see that so you have
16:34 - some work to do why is it still like
16:38 - that
16:43 - check out our main content and root this
16:48 - is what used to be display:none it's not
16:52 - displayed on anymore
16:53 - so where is a content
17:16 - this is the one all right okay this is
17:23 - one that one of the tags is a title tag
17:26 - which is crazy
17:37 - let's see so we'll definitely need to
17:42 - make sure we change title tags that that
17:46 - should probably be just kind of a
17:47 - universal thing if a title tag comes
17:50 - through the data we definitely just
17:53 - switch it I think we're pretty safe to
17:56 - switch titles two h2s across the board
18:03 - let's see
18:07 - there is no subtitle although we
18:11 - probably should switch subtitle to I
18:14 - don't know we'll have to see what works
18:16 - maybe an h4 or something but see if it
18:21 - displays anything at all right now
18:37 - okay it actually does display so we
18:40 - don't really need to change that I'm
18:44 - okay with that being subtitle for now
18:46 - because even that that size is okay with
18:51 - me all right so now let's check out
18:53 - these tabs oh we have a title within the
18:58 - tabs all right so it's gonna be a little
19:01 - tricky I don't think we can just go with
19:02 - h2s all the time all right so maybe we
19:12 - can get yeah so its titles are
19:19 - display:none by default which is that
19:23 - makes sense
19:26 - hmm I definitely don't want to leave it
19:31 - as title so here's what we do we can
19:39 - switch it up and hmm I'd really hate to
19:49 - have a bunch of h2s but maybe we might
20:01 - have to do that for now like this is not
20:03 - going to be the final version of this
20:04 - markup for now maybe we we have all h2s
20:08 - and then if you have h2s that are inside
20:13 - tabs they'll be a little bit smaller
20:15 - font size
20:16 - so that's not ideal ideal but so I mean
20:20 - ideally you have a hierarchy to your
20:22 - structure right so changing the size is
20:26 - not really a big deal but having that
20:31 - many headings on your page and saying
20:34 - they're all of equal weight is I mean
20:37 - it's just not true right the main title
20:40 - should be an h1 or potentially an h2 and
20:44 - then anything below that can't be at
20:46 - that same level all right so from you
20:50 - know and
20:51 - CEO point of view we're trying to tell
20:54 - them what the most important thing is
20:57 - and I'm not sure if it has an impact on
21:01 - screen readers or not but I suppose it
21:07 - couldn't hurt to be more explicit with
21:09 - you know this is the main heading these
21:11 - are the subheadings so for now we'll do
21:15 - the h2s we'll switch everything h2s but
21:18 - it's not gonna be like that forever
21:21 - it'll probably end up staying like that
21:23 - when we launch but eventually we're
21:26 - gonna change it okay so see we have
21:33 - title all right - this whole thing
21:35 - you're just titles titles and then write
21:43 - title okay so I think it might not be a
21:51 - bad idea to bring this up here and see
21:57 - what they what all this markup was
21:59 - supposed to look like originally well
22:04 - Austria is gonna need to have its own
22:06 - post site there are a lot of Austria
22:08 - pages see academics but I think it's
22:13 - this page
22:25 - - this one
22:31 - hmm that's interesting
22:43 - maybe the content we're dealing with
22:47 - isn't even actually linked anymore uh
22:50 - sure courses offered where did we pull
22:53 - that all right well in any case we're
23:04 - gonna display this as you know just one
23:06 - list let's see all right let's do that
23:15 - lets go to our component now we've done
23:17 - something similar in another component
23:19 - so let's find that to find that one it
23:24 - wasn't news let's check our news
23:26 - component now it wasn't news all right
23:30 - let's check out directories Department
23:43 - no I know that I did something faculty
23:48 - there we are okay so here's what we did
23:51 - so I know Harshit was talking about
23:53 - pulling data and changing the changing
24:02 - the data like as we pull it in with a
24:04 - regular expression that's one way to do
24:06 - it but I've already pulled it in and
24:07 - I've put in a lot of data so there's no
24:10 - way I'm pulling in all that data again
24:12 - so another way to do this you know after
24:18 - the fact since we already have this data
24:19 - is to do something like this so here I
24:25 - just kind of you know created this to
24:29 - grab the data so that same data that we
24:33 - would normally input here I just made a
24:37 - constant here that takes that data and
24:39 - replaces details with div class details
24:45 - and then puts an ending div tag where
24:48 - the ending details tag was and then down
24:53 - here we simply
24:55 - put content so it's it's pretty simple
24:59 - it's easy to tell when you look at the
25:01 - component what's happening so it's not a
25:04 - it's not a bad solution and this is
25:08 - something that I suppose could be you
25:11 - know pulled out into its own kind of
25:13 - utility component if there were enough
25:15 - things like this going on that we could
25:18 - reuse for now we don't really have that
25:20 - going on but let's take this if we see
25:26 - other things like a details component
25:28 - you know coming in that we want to
25:30 - change you know we could definitely
25:32 - reuse this at some point we might want
25:35 - to have just you know all content
25:38 - running through something like this but
25:41 - we don't really know what we need until
25:43 - we go through more of this content
25:44 - alright so let's go back to our pages
25:47 - dot j/s component and let's put some of
25:51 - this in here actually let me make sure
25:56 - where was this faculty okay
26:13 - it's so inside of our return is that we
26:23 - had it yeah goodness was in our render
26:32 - function I believe it was in our render
26:34 - function I can double check I suppose
26:51 - alright here we are
26:59 - I don't know I must have accidentally
27:03 - copied but I didn't want to copy okay
27:07 - oops I have too many pages open let's
27:13 - get rid of I'll say let's get rid of
27:15 - what we don't need there we are
27:18 - faculty okay so yes within our render
27:25 - function and not the return function
27:29 - there we are and blocks what's not a pad
27:36 - about okay all right so let's change
27:46 - this up and so we have title now we're
27:50 - going to change this well
27:58 - let's change the title and then here
28:02 - well we'll give it a class of title just
28:06 - so that we can remember like when we're
28:08 - inspecting that this used to be a title
28:10 - tag it should help us you know if we
28:12 - have to go into dev tools and try to
28:14 - figure out what's going on and then
28:16 - we'll change it to an h2 and then here
28:22 - we're just gonna grab let's see we're
28:31 - gonna put in our content oops let me
28:34 - copy this and paste it here there we are
28:41 - oh we have alright we can't use this
28:47 - exactly like music because we have our
28:51 - query okay so we just need to change
28:53 - where we're where we have this then so
28:57 - we've used the the newer way of doing a
29:01 - query so we need to switch this up a bit
29:04 - so if we put it down here now we have
29:06 - access to this data so you see whereas
29:09 - before I had that little red squiggly
29:11 - line because this didn't exist
29:12 - now we don't alright so now that
29:15 - constant is gonna live here within our
29:18 - query and then we can change it and just
29:23 - use content here all right so let's save
29:31 - see what happens let's see okay cool so
29:40 - look we have all this content goodness
29:46 - yeah we definitely want there needs to
29:51 - be some styling happening here so I
29:54 - definitely want to see I'm assuming all
29:56 - this was all within title tags and now
29:58 - it's all h2s
30:05 - yes so that's an H - that's an H - okay
30:12 - we're gonna get a little creative here
30:14 - with without we style this this is
30:16 - definitely going to be something that
30:18 - you don't normally have to do and I
30:21 - don't think I started now I did not
30:23 - start my timer let's see oh okay yeah
30:30 - it's definitely time for me to take a
30:32 - break and go back to the live chat so
30:34 - I'm going to do that now
30:34 - when we come back from our five minute
30:36 - break then we're gonna get in here and
30:40 - we're gonna style all these h2s
30:43 - so that they in fact do not look like
30:46 - h2s but instead look like a nice list so
30:50 - really these should probably be like a
30:55 - lies it should be h2 h3
30:58 - el eyes we're not gonna get that right
31:02 - now at some point we'll have it but not
31:05 - right now all right so there's one
31:13 - question at the bottom that I'm just
31:14 - gonna address right now because it's
31:16 - very relevant so John Hanson says for
31:19 - future content that will live on the
31:22 - WordPress database will users who input
31:25 - new data get a set template that will
31:28 - keep all things consistent with the data
31:30 - pool yes yes definitely
31:34 - so when possible it will be very
31:39 - specific there will be certain fields
31:41 - that will only allow you to input
31:43 - certain types of data when we need more
31:48 - of a like a Content area that can accept
31:51 - HTML that will be allowed but there's
31:55 - not not every user will have access to
31:59 - do things like that and I will put in
32:04 - instructions so usually what I do when I
32:08 - make something like this and they're
32:09 - going to be users that are entering
32:11 - content on their own is I create some
32:13 - tutorial videos for them so I'll have
32:17 - either a video or a document or usually
32:20 - both that outlines here's what you do
32:23 - you know for all these different post
32:25 - types and then within the post types
32:28 - themselves I'll have instructions so
32:30 - that when they go to enter something
32:31 - into a field there'll be instructions
32:33 - right there below it saying here's an
32:35 - example of what I want so so far that's
32:39 - worked well I haven't with the other
32:41 - sites I've done like this I it's going
32:44 - well so for this case I'll actually have
32:48 - more direct contact with the people
32:50 - editing it because my boss will be the
32:54 - primary person editing it and then the
32:56 - other developer who works right next to
32:58 - me will be doing it and then student
33:00 - workers that will be working right
33:02 - outside my door so if there's any issues
33:06 - someone could actually you know talk to
33:08 - me face-to-face about it but it's I'm
33:14 - definitely going to be very specific
33:15 - with the instructions so they'll be
33:18 - freedom to do different things where
33:20 - there needs to be but it'll basically be
33:22 - you know the fields will only accept
33:24 - what I want them to accept at some point
33:29 - and that'll probably all happen after
33:31 - the launch because all that stuff's like
33:34 - behind the scenes stuff that I can do
33:36 - whenever and the the user you know the
33:39 - ultimate user trying to look at this
33:41 - site may not even realize that a change
33:44 - has occurred all right so let me scroll
33:50 - up and find some questions
34:07 - John Hanson says looks like the dog
34:08 - image has been improved using background
34:10 - size cover though I think it also needs
34:13 - background position Center Center
34:15 - yeah it could could be I I'm not I don't
34:19 - usually bother doing anything with the
34:20 - stock images I kind of want to see what
34:23 - images I need to use for real but John
34:27 - also says add a closing X in the corner
34:29 - of the menu
34:30 - yeah I've I noticed this yesterday and I
34:34 - think that would be a great idea that'll
34:37 - probably go on the list of it's not
34:41 - essential to have before we launch
34:43 - because like the odds of somebody having
34:46 - a phone this narrow are pretty small I
34:48 - can actually look at the analytics right
34:49 - now and see if anybody's using a phone
34:51 - that small but that's pretty narrow and
34:57 - it would be nice to have the X we can
35:02 - also make this a little bit smaller I
35:05 - mean really there's no reason right now
35:08 - but this has to be this wide but anyway
35:14 - I totally agree John I had the same
35:16 - thought
35:21 - brooke says isn't the menu itself
35:23 - swipeable on most material design apps
35:25 - yeah it usually is swipeable I don't I
35:28 - was not able to swipe this but it could
35:31 - be because I'm not actually on a device
35:34 - alright now that I think about that I
35:37 - should check this since we have n grok
35:39 - running let me let me just grab the end
35:43 - Rock link and I'm not going to try to
35:47 - type it out I'm gonna send it to myself
35:51 - let's see it's the easiest way to
35:54 - centers I'll just put it my Google keep
36:09 - all right so Google keep is a
36:11 - note-taking app and it syncs up pretty
36:15 - quickly so hopefully it syncs
36:17 - immediately now and I can just open this
36:19 - up on my phone because if it's if it is
36:22 - swipeable then that's good to know I
36:24 - still like the idea of having an icon
36:26 - there just to be sure that it's you know
36:28 - hundred percent clear to users but users
36:33 - may also if they're used to being able
36:35 - to swipe in they can't swipe that's
36:37 - going to be an annoyance to them it's
36:44 - not swipeable right now so when we've
36:48 - done things with materialized CSS that
36:52 - is swipeable but right now this is not
36:56 - swipeable also that doesn't look it's
37:03 - much more noticeable that there's not
37:04 - enough padding at the top on mobile
37:06 - right here so I definitely need to make
37:09 - sure you get some padding but that's the
37:11 - type of thing that I'm going to be doing
37:12 - in the streams for at least today and
37:15 - tomorrow is really working on some of
37:17 - those little details especially on the
37:19 - home page yeah we'll have to check maybe
37:25 - there's an issue with material I already
37:28 - open about being swipeable if not you
37:32 - know maybe that's something that we can
37:34 - create and maybe submit a pull request
37:39 - for material UI to do that I mean that
37:43 - that seems like a pretty common design
37:44 - pattern for material design apps that
37:46 - should be there so Niki thanks that was
37:53 - a yeah Niki thanks for bringing that up
38:00 - all right I need I need to take my
38:04 - sweater off because it's super hot in my
38:06 - office now
38:07 - my office the rest of the department is
38:11 - actually pretty like cold the right
38:14 - outside my door is really cold the girl
38:18 - who works she kind of has like an open
38:21 - office thing going on but the girl who
38:23 - works right outside my door always has a
38:26 - blanket because it's so cold but my
38:29 - office is always really warm and it's
38:32 - all the screens all the screens create a
38:35 - lot of heat so a sweater is appropriate
38:40 - for everywhere else except through my
38:42 - office
38:43 - I don't want to run the fan because you
38:47 - know it would mess up the audio as soon
38:50 - as it streamed over I'm definitely
38:51 - running the fan though alright
39:15 - hey in this here hey and how's it going
39:18 - and this will be the last question and
39:20 - then I'll go back to the code because my
39:22 - timer did run out but in it says how is
39:24 - your working day not too bad today
39:29 - I had a meeting so every Thursday
39:33 - morning we have a department meeting and
39:36 - basically everybody in my department
39:38 - which is about I don't know about a
39:40 - dozen people sometimes not everyone is
39:42 - there but about a dozen people and we
39:47 - just quickly go over what we're working
39:49 - on sometimes it can get a little bit
39:53 - long so I'm not I'm not a big fan of the
39:57 - weekly meeting
39:58 - I always keep mine short so today mine
40:03 - was most of what I said was just I've
40:06 - been working on this site so that was my
40:10 - day but I did get some more data
40:13 - transferred over which was nice I was
40:16 - actually up at like 10:00 till 4:00 this
40:20 - morning
40:21 - and I I couldn't go back to sleep so I
40:26 - just got up got a good workout in made a
40:30 - latte
40:31 - I ate a bunch of eggs for breakfast and
40:36 - still managed to get my kids ready and
40:39 - get them to school on time and get
40:41 - myself into work so so not not a bad day
40:44 - although right now I already feel tired
40:47 - in a couple hours I'll be ready to go to
40:48 - bed cuz I've been up since before 4:00
40:54 - but anyway thank you for asking
40:57 - and and I know it's it's on the live
41:00 - chat so I usually don't ask you how
41:01 - things are going but I will now so how's
41:05 - everything going with you you don't have
41:07 - to say in a live chat if you don't want
41:08 - if you grab their answer on insta or
41:12 - Twitter or something let me know but I
41:14 - feel bad you're always very considerate
41:17 - and asking how I am and I usually don't
41:20 - during the live chat ask ask you so
41:23 - anyway if you feel like sharing please
41:27 - let me know
41:28 - let's see alright
41:31 - a related follow-up question there is
41:33 - sim sim Ranjit says how is your
41:37 - work-life balance and sim Ranjit if I
41:39 - messed up the pronunciation of your name
41:40 - please let me know I really want to get
41:42 - it right right now my work-life balance
41:45 - I think is pretty good I went on home
41:50 - I've been doing very little work
41:52 - sometimes I was still like message about
41:54 - projects and things but I try not to
41:59 - actually do any coding at home right now
42:01 - and just spend time with my kids so it's
42:06 - like it's been not bad I've been reading
42:09 - to the kids and oh cool I got cimarron
42:13 - G's name right awesome so I've been
42:16 - spending time you know read to the kids
42:19 - and hold the baby a lot and I've been
42:24 - playing we got a Nintendo switch for
42:27 - Christmas so I'll play that with the
42:28 - kids and we it's fun because we talked
42:30 - about it you know you know we'll say
42:33 - like hey you know I got this today on
42:35 - this game and and that's kind of fun to
42:39 - have like a common interest you know
42:41 - with the kids so so that's cool and I've
42:44 - been getting my workouts in so this is
42:46 - two weeks on Monday so over two weeks
42:49 - now that I worked out every morning so I
42:51 - started out in some I've been doing
42:53 - cardio and now I started adding some
42:55 - some weights and things so it's not bad
42:59 - I actually gained like five pounds since
43:02 - I started working out normally you work
43:04 - out you want to lose weight but I I
43:06 - assume I'm gaining muscle because I'm
43:09 - working out and I'm actually eating
43:11 - slightly healthier than I normally do so
43:13 - anyway I think my balance is going well
43:16 - right now hopefully I can keep it up and
43:18 - the key for me I think the key change
43:21 - that I've made is I'm going to bed early
43:23 - and consistently so I rarely stay up
43:27 - past like 9:30
43:30 - sometimes I'm in bed before 9:00
43:33 - basically when I put my kids to sleep I
43:35 - go to sleep too when they're brushing
43:37 - their teeth or tonight I'm brushing my
43:38 - teeth and
43:39 - we all you know just go to bed so that's
43:45 - it I've had to sacrifice some Netflix
43:47 - but I think it's worth it anyway so I
43:51 - took a really long time to answer that
43:53 - but I think questions like that are
43:54 - important because being a developer and
43:58 - being successful isn't just about the
43:59 - code if you are great at the code but
44:03 - you can't keep that balance you get all
44:04 - stressed out you know your mental health
44:07 - isn't good ever your physical health
44:08 - isn't good then the code is gonna suffer
44:11 - so that can be just as important as you
44:16 - know you have somebody that's mentally
44:17 - and physically healthy who's not that
44:20 - good a developer right now then they
44:23 - have a good base to learn more but if
44:25 - you have somebody who's an expert but
44:28 - they're their life otherwise it's a mess
44:30 - you know I if I was gonna hire somebody
44:33 - I'd hire the the new person that at
44:36 - least has the rest of their stuff
44:38 - together not that I don't have concern
44:41 - for the other person I'd you know I'd
44:42 - want to help them out but if I had to
44:45 - choose you know for the good of a
44:46 - company or something that's who I'd pick
44:48 - so anyway I do want to make sure I have
44:53 - content that you are interested in so if
44:55 - you'd rather hear less or more about the
44:57 - the other part of a developer's life the
45:01 - you know physical social you know mental
45:04 - let me know I can talk about that more
45:07 - I'll try to make sure that I save that
45:09 - for the end though because there are
45:11 - some people that really just want the
45:14 - code and I know they probably get
45:16 - annoyed by these long breaks in the
45:19 - middle of all right now I don't want to
45:25 - make it sound like I always have
45:26 - everything together right I don't this
45:28 - just the last two weeks have been
45:30 - exceptional usually like for the LAT for
45:33 - months and months before that I just
45:35 - felt like I didn't have anything
45:36 - together and I'm sure if you asked my
45:39 - wife I would sound even less together
45:41 - than I sound right now this she sees
45:45 - everything from a whole different
45:46 - perspective so she'd probably tell you
45:49 - about how I bought candy a junk food for
45:51 - all the kids two days ago
45:53 - and and that kind of thing but alright
45:58 - let's get back to the code I'm gonna set
46:00 - my timer now then I'm gonna remember to
46:02 - bring it over here on this screen so we
46:03 - all can see 25 minutes we're gonna do
46:06 - our best to make this page look good and
46:08 - then check out a few other pages just to
46:10 - make sure we haven't like mess things up
46:12 - on those other pages and then we'll see
46:15 - how we're doing on time you know if we
46:17 - get it looking good maybe we'll just you
46:20 - know go back do some more question and
46:21 - answer and finish up the stream we'll
46:23 - see how it goes so if you do have a
46:26 - question or comment or anything you know
46:28 - put it in here now and then you know I
46:30 - will get to it in about 25 minutes
46:34 - alright so for now this h2 is fun I
46:38 - usually like things to be a bit thinner
46:40 - than this but I'm not gonna worry about
46:43 - detail like small details right now but
46:48 - this this heading definitely needs to be
46:52 - smaller so let's inspect that and that's
46:55 - gonna be at ABS h2 so let's go back to
46:59 - our CSS file to be working mainly in
47:04 - this file at this point and I don't
47:08 - think we have anything with tabs yet and
47:11 - let's see what we kind of wonder if we
47:20 - really need this on these pages name
47:28 - phone email CV link video image
47:30 - blockless for details right home logs
47:36 - hmm I I want to see if we're
47:39 - accidentally hiding anything so I'm
47:41 - gonna comment that out right now all
47:47 - right it doesn't look like we're hiding
47:48 - anything else so that's that's good I
47:50 - just want to see what we're hiding if
47:52 - we're hiding anything so let's do what
47:57 - was it tabs yeah tabs and then we're
48:01 - gonna do h2 right so in in CSS land
48:05 - why am i all abilities empty this is how
48:09 - we select an h2 that is a child of tabs
48:13 - and is this is this direct child I
48:17 - believe it's the direct child of tab so
48:20 - that we do want to use that we can take
48:23 - advantage of the cascading nature CSS
48:25 - here to make sure that those sub h2s
48:29 - that we're gonna get to in a minute
48:30 - actually are getting the correct styles
48:33 - so it won't really matter one way or
48:37 - another but let's let's try this let's
48:41 - try pixel oops font size and let's give
48:47 - it 24 pixels
48:48 - oops 24 pixels for now that may be too
48:52 - big we'll see and then our font weight
48:58 - let's go with 400 for now and I'm not
49:05 - worried about colors so much we may get
49:07 - to that but let me see what the color is
49:13 - now I don't want it to be solid black so
49:16 - as long as it's not solid black I'm okay
49:18 - with it
49:19 - where is h2 computed
49:31 - huh that's interesting I wonder maybe if
49:34 - there's no color set at all and this
49:38 - then is the default for the browser
49:41 - that's interesting
49:43 - all right so what I would want is color
49:48 - let's go yes so this this does look like
49:53 - it is black it it matches all these so
49:56 - what I really want though is to do it
49:59 - like this and have 87 so I'd rather have
50:10 - the color be 87 let's make sure
50:12 - okay t7 it's really hard to who uh to
50:18 - see a difference but that's something
50:23 - that I want to apply across the board
50:24 - I'm not going to worry about it right
50:26 - now but let's see tabs h2 you know what
50:33 - what we just did should have applied
50:35 - let's make sure I'm in the right file
50:37 - page so CSS why did it not apply with
50:40 - what's going on tabs h2
50:56 - let me see I'm gonna check the live chat
50:58 - and maybe I made something different
51:01 - maybe I messed something up I mean soy
51:04 - su I would paramount
51:18 - uh-huh this is interesting so so does
51:20 - the space actually matter I was under
51:24 - the impression that this the space
51:26 - didn't matter but let's let's try it out
51:28 - and see so the first way I did it didn't
51:32 - have any effect at all now let's see
51:34 - let's try again maybe I was mistaken I
51:37 - think you all are right the space
51:43 - mattered very interesting for some
51:51 - reason I just didn't think the space
51:54 - mattered I just thought that was
51:55 - commonly how you wrote it
51:57 - all right cool very good to know so in
52:00 - case you didn't catch that originally I
52:03 - had written this tabs and then you know
52:07 - the this little was that a greater than
52:09 - sign yeah a little greater than sign and
52:12 - then h2 but I had spaces between that
52:15 - but that was not the correct way to do
52:18 - that so all right cool so that works
52:22 - let's see how it looks
52:24 - all right I'm I like that yeah I like
52:30 - that I think that's it's not bad I do
52:35 - want to see what the font size for this
52:36 - is 24 and I don't want them to be the
52:40 - same so let's drop that down then let's
52:43 - drop this one down to my don't we say 20
52:48 - let's try 20 see how that looks alright
52:55 - um I still I don't really like that but
52:58 - I'll I'll go with that for now
53:01 - maybe once we drop these down in size
53:04 - it'll it'll look more reasonable all
53:12 - right also thanks to everyone that
53:14 - pointed out that that space matters I
53:16 - see several of you were we're talking
53:18 - about the spaces on Hill and Nikki and
53:23 - I'm not sure who else all were saying
53:26 - that but everybody who was thank you all
53:30 - right so let's check this
53:31 - now and first we'll test out some styles
53:34 - here and see see how we like it see if
53:40 - we can get mmm
53:43 - no it's not exactly what I want h to
53:47 - title alright let's go with left and put
54:00 - that there
54:04 - type that up to 22 and then we're also
54:08 - gonna have a right H to title alright
54:23 - we'll give it a quick refresh just to
54:26 - make sure okay that's a little bit more
54:29 - obvious the hierarchy that we have here
54:31 - and let me give it a scroll just to see
54:37 - what else we have going on here all
54:41 - right so we have another header it says
54:43 - fall only spring only okay now obviously
54:50 - we have a problem with spacing right so
54:53 - let's let's deal with our spacing issues
54:56 - why do we have spacing issues like this
55:03 - is that these these be ours
55:17 - there we go oh yeah we're gonna have to
55:20 - set the BR display:none I really I hate
55:24 - to do that because there may be very
55:26 - meaningful you know break tags that are
55:32 - in here but it just it seems like from
55:34 - what I've seen of the content the break
55:37 - tags are not meaningful so I think we're
55:43 - better off displaying none on the break
55:45 - tags and then when we need to we'll add
55:48 - in padding with our CSS that's the way I
55:51 - prefer anyway yeah all right so this is
55:58 - looking a lot better not a hundred
56:01 - percent what I would want this there's
56:03 - still some some spacing issues but so
56:10 - much better so let's make sure we do a
56:13 - br nun which I think we already had down
56:15 - here did we we did so we already had
56:20 - that be our nun so I still want to leave
56:25 - this commented out for now because I'd
56:28 - like to know if we're hiding anything
56:29 - else but I'm gonna add that BR now
56:31 - so the BR set to none won't actually
56:34 - hide any content anyway it'll just get
56:37 - rid of space so I'm okay with having
56:40 - that as display:none all right all right
56:49 - so sometimes I get a red line and I
56:51 - think is just delayed that it shouldn't
56:54 - be there anymore it just hasn't left yet
56:57 - all right just double-check make sure it
56:59 - works yep that works and
57:10 - what do you think you know what this is
57:14 - probably throwing me off that I haven't
57:15 - zoomed in alright that's that definitely
57:19 - looks more reasonable I think what we
57:22 - ought to do though is make sure that
57:26 - there's a bit more space so let's see
57:31 - what we have going on here in each tab I
57:37 - think each tab should have some padding
57:43 - or some margin at the bottom bottom and
57:48 - let's make it 16 pixels okay let's see
57:54 - what's going on it's basically done
57:57 - nothing
58:09 - there we are okay
58:50 - okay let's throw this in here as well
58:58 - all right our CSS definitely could use
59:01 - some better organization but I'm always
59:08 - I'm okay with letting that go until we
59:11 - get farther along sometimes if you
59:14 - organize prematurely then you need to
59:18 - just reorganize everything again so I'd
59:23 - rather not rather kind of wait till we
59:26 - get more out there all right
59:28 - I I don't love this this right now I
59:31 - think I think that there's still not
59:35 - enough distinction between these
59:36 - headings and the actual content so I
59:43 - either need to make this font size
59:45 - smaller which I don't really want to do
59:47 - I think 18 pixels is kind of the minimum
59:50 - I'd like to go here so the alternative
59:53 - would be to make this h2 larger and then
59:57 - I can make these ones larger as well so
60:03 - maybe I'll do that I'm just not sure I
60:07 - don't want to think about that let's see
60:10 - if you want to see how I'm on time okay
60:12 - so about 10 minutes left
60:14 - all right maybe let's let's try it then
60:17 - we can just try it here dev tools and
60:19 - see see what we want to do for 1.5 um so
60:23 - what's the computed all right 24 I'm
60:28 - sorry I knew that already I don't know I
60:30 - forgot all right so let's try this font
60:34 - size 26 pixels let's try 28 all right 28
60:43 - pixels and then we can make these
60:51 - 24 let's see if that is enough for me
61:02 - yeah I think that's that's a lot more
61:06 - significant that stands out the only
61:08 - other thing that I think might work as
61:10 - well is let's try out let's try our font
61:15 - weight here we can try 300 I like that
61:23 - I really like that what do you all think
61:25 - about this these changes here I still
61:31 - don't like this bold being this being
61:33 - that bold but I really like the thin
61:36 - font let's see what the font size or
61:44 - font weight is here 700 Wow no wonder
61:47 - that so thick I yeah 500 is way more
62:02 - reasonable yeah I usually never go above
62:07 - 500 for font weight okay all right so
62:12 - let's change this then and so our h2s
62:17 - are gonna be CSS is so messed up it is
62:28 - bothering me but I'm gonna I'm gonna
62:29 - hold back the urge to change it and
62:31 - right now font size and font weights and
62:38 - then we changed our font size here to 24
62:44 - and we changed our font weight here to
62:47 - 300 and let's refresh just to be sure
62:54 - excellent all right now it is much more
62:58 - obvious with the hierarchy of this pages
63:01 - alright
63:04 - cool I'm really glad that I didn't just
63:06 - leave that alone sometimes not being
63:09 - satisfied with your design is is not the
63:12 - right way to go because you spend too
63:13 - much time on it but in this case this
63:15 - this worked out so I don't know I think
63:19 - that's kind of thing is sometimes if if
63:21 - you work on something enough you start
63:22 - to get a feel for something like this
63:25 - isn't a big deal don't waste your time
63:27 - on it or this is a big deal and you
63:31 - don't always you know you don't always
63:32 - choose the right thing all the time but
63:36 - in this case it didn't take that long
63:38 - and I think the result is a lot better
63:42 - than what we had just a few minutes ago
63:43 - you check my time are at six minutes
63:48 - alright so now that we have this I think
63:51 - we ought to check out what's going on
63:54 - now with some of the other pieces of
63:58 - content so I'm just gonna go back
64:00 - through here the some of what we had and
64:04 - scroll all right this one doesn't seem
64:10 - to have any area here's some some
64:13 - headings let's see what these are these
64:15 - HT - yeah these are h2s okay not bad I'm
64:19 - actually okay with the way this look I
64:21 - think those are fun and what's this this
64:25 - might not even be a H tag at all in h4
64:29 - okay all right okay that's not too bad
64:35 - all right so it looks like we the
64:38 - hierarchy is there the hierarchy works I
64:41 - oh that's way too small notice that in H
64:45 - five all right so I'm definitely gonna
64:47 - have to take a look at the the H tags
64:49 - overall kind of the global settings for
64:52 - the H tags and then change them based on
64:56 - what our base font weight is which our
64:58 - base font weight should be at the
65:00 - minimum 16 all right so we do have 18
65:02 - I'm okay with that actually like 18 B in
65:05 - the base so if 18 is our base font
65:07 - weight or I'm sorry font size then the
65:10 - h5 s can't be
65:12 - right now can't be 13.2 eight pixels so
65:18 - we they have to be at least you know 20
65:21 - right does that make sense that you know
65:24 - any heading no matter H five or whatever
65:28 - it still needs to be bigger than the
65:30 - base want okay
65:33 - let me check the check because I think I
65:35 - asked you all what you thought about
65:36 - that and I didn't even check for the
65:38 - answer I apologize
65:42 - Joan Anson says looks good for the fun
65:44 - weights now and it says I think
65:46 - display:none is a bad idea and I'd like
65:49 - to know why what what's your reasoning
65:53 - for thinking it's a bad idea would it be
65:55 - better to just remove those BR tags
66:00 - because I'm open to doing that as well I
66:03 - mean the easiest way to do it is with
66:05 - CSS but the easiest ways of course not
66:08 - always the best way so I would I would
66:10 - like to know the the thoughts behind
66:12 - that okay all right if you have asked a
66:20 - question I haven't got to it yet just
66:22 - about four more minutes and I'll get to
66:23 - all the questions so please be patient
66:27 - what are these they're lies okay so it
66:33 - looks like the Allies have a different
66:35 - font weight but these ones don't
66:40 - what are these so it our ordered lists
66:47 - have a different different styles than
66:49 - our unordered list so I'll probably want
66:52 - to change that at some point I don't
66:58 - think I'm going to try to get into it
66:59 - right now because we don't have that
67:00 - much time but and I just want to check
67:03 - some of these other ones as well let's
67:05 - see alright here's our about page so we
67:10 - have this this ought to be an h2o and h1
67:17 - okay I'm gonna have to make a decision
67:21 - and see like what do we do we want to
67:28 - have some consistency with these so I
67:30 - think there ought to be if possible but
67:35 - other than that I like out of this shows
67:37 - up right now yeah that page is good this
67:45 - associate page I think that what's wrong
67:49 - with this page do we not have a title at
67:51 - all huh
67:54 - I may have to check out this page on the
68:02 - on the site right now
68:03 - and see if there's a title because that
68:06 - looks odd
68:11 - it's h3 at the top
68:23 - yeah I think we definitely want to make
68:25 - sure that all pages have a title and I'm
68:27 - you know this obviously this is a
68:29 - subtitle so I just need to make sure it
68:33 - looks like the title doesn't exist in
68:35 - the main data so maybe I will just pull
68:45 - in it's different for different pieces
68:51 - of content so it's it's going to be a
68:53 - little tricky because sometimes in the
68:59 - main content there's it already includes
69:01 - the title and sometimes it doesn't so I
69:03 - don't want to get duplicate titles so I
69:05 - can't just add a title in across the
69:07 - board like pull win the word press post
69:10 - title so yeah I'm gonna have to think
69:16 - about I'm gonna have to figure out which
69:18 - post types are pulling in titles
69:21 - automatically and which ones are and
69:25 - then go from there okay
69:29 - only have about a minute left I think
69:31 - we've checked enough pages now I've got
69:39 - h2 h3 okay not too bad all right not bad
69:51 - this is all these are all acceptable I
69:56 - wouldn't say that it's exactly how I
69:58 - would do it if I was doing this all from
70:00 - scratch and had complete freedom over
70:02 - how this displays but considering that
70:06 - we put in all this HTML from this old
70:09 - system that had been put in by you know
70:11 - a variety of different people over years
70:13 - by I think it's displaying you know
70:17 - quite well so or at least well enough
70:19 - that I'm comfortable with something that
70:22 - looks like this you know being what we
70:24 - launched with
70:32 - okay all right Anna just explained so
70:35 - she's saying if I want to use BR in
70:39 - articles I cannot because you hit it
70:42 - globally that's a good point you know
70:49 - that's a good point I just all right now
70:53 - let's think about that we need some way
70:57 - to get rid of all that space that's
71:01 - coming with those those BR tags but at
71:06 - the same time do we want to give the
71:09 - editors the freedom to add in their own
71:11 - tags and and have that be respected
71:28 - I'm gonna have to think about that I
71:31 - just I've I thought up a few potential
71:34 - solutions but I don't think any of them
71:36 - are really that good I'm thinking like
71:41 - potentially we could still hide our the
71:43 - BR tags and then just have a note in the
71:47 - editor to let users know if you want to
71:49 - use a break then use this other tag and
71:52 - basically we'll just invent another tag
71:54 - and make it act like a br so I don't
71:57 - like that because like now users have to
72:02 - remember to use another tag it's
72:04 - problematic if you're copying and
72:05 - pasting code from somewhere else and
72:07 - trying to use that so that's why I don't
72:10 - like that solution although it would
72:12 - work it's not great the other solution
72:17 - is to try to go through all the data
72:19 - right now and remove most of the BR tags
72:22 - then we don't have to hide them but that
72:26 - solution would either I maybe there's a
72:32 - way to do it in WordPress and alter the
72:34 - database you know with one command I
72:36 - don't know how to do that I could maybe
72:38 - I could learn then there's a possibility
72:40 - though of us my I guess we wouldn't be
72:44 - getting rid of er tags where we need
72:46 - them because right now we're hiding them
72:47 - so it's the same thing
72:52 - it could have somebody manually go
72:55 - through which is going to take a while
72:56 - we probably won't get that done before
72:57 - launch cuz I don't really have anybody
73:00 - right now but I know I could give that
73:01 - task to or I can re migrate the data and
73:10 - at the same time strip out the BR tags
73:12 - which I really don't want to do all
73:15 - right so those are my who is that for
73:19 - maybe solutions I'm gonna have to think
73:23 - on this a little bit more the other
73:25 - solution is just to leave them hidden
73:27 - for now and then have that on the list
73:31 - of things for somebody to manually do
73:32 - when they go through the data and then
73:34 - whenever they get finished with that I
73:36 - can then remove the CSS rule that hides
73:38 - the BR tags and so then they'll be okay
73:41 - to you
73:42 - again that that actually might be the
73:46 - best solution because there won't be I
73:53 - don't think there will be that many
73:55 - changes you know that quickly to the
73:57 - site and hopefully I can get somebody to
74:02 - go through that data soon let me know
74:07 - what you all think I'm not I'm not a
74:10 - hundred percent sure about any of them
74:11 - any of those those options all right let
74:17 - me scroll up a bit and answer some more
74:20 - questions that'll be it for the coding
74:22 - part of this so if you don't want to
74:23 - stick around for the question and answer
74:24 - thank you so much for watching but if
74:26 - you do have a little bit more time and
74:28 - you can stick around I definitely
74:29 - appreciate it if you would and help
74:32 - answer some questions and you know ask
74:34 - some of your own if if you'd like
74:46 - Aaron Arun Monterey our UN let me know
74:51 - that pronounce that says says hey oh hey
74:54 - how's it going thanks for for watching
75:13 - okay there's a little conversation going
75:16 - on here between Nikki and and on how
75:19 - about CSS so I think it would be
75:22 - worthwhile for me to put this in the
75:24 - video for those year watching later so
75:27 - let me just type a little bit in here so
75:31 - the question is what's the difference
75:32 - between this tabs h2 and tabs h2 so and
75:42 - this one on hell is explaining this in
75:45 - here so I'm not gonna read it out word
75:46 - for word I'll just kind of demonstrate
75:48 - here this first one only selects the
75:51 - tabs that are a direct descendant of the
75:54 - h2 right so there's you don't go down
75:59 - any more levels it would have to be tabs
76:01 - and then right after that h2s so even if
76:04 - there's like five h2s as long as they're
76:07 - just a child a direct child all those
76:11 - eight shoes will be selected but tabs h2
76:13 - will select children grandchildren and
76:16 - great-grandchildren all the way down so
76:18 - you could have tabs and then a div and
76:20 - then within that div in h2 it will still
76:23 - be selected so with the first one it
76:26 - wouldn't be selected if it was inside a
76:28 - div the second one it would and it could
76:31 - be inside 50 dense or nested and it
76:34 - would still be selected all right
76:37 - hopefully that makes sense to you all
76:38 - let me know if it doesn't but there's
76:42 - our CSS lesson of the day
76:45 - brought to you by own hell thank you
76:48 - very much
77:04 - grim reaper says why is it said that
77:07 - front-end web development is pretty
77:08 - messed up I don't I don't know I think
77:12 - people here's my guess I obviously don't
77:17 - know what the intentions are of the
77:19 - people who say this but based on what
77:22 - I've seen of people saying that and
77:23 - similar things my guess is that there is
77:28 - so there are so many different options
77:30 - and there's not there's usually not one
77:32 - clear front-runner for how to do pretty
77:35 - much anything in front-end you know from
77:38 - you know what UI framework am I going to
77:40 - use to MIT you SAS les post CSS styled
77:45 - components glamour you know it there's
77:49 - so many options you know what routing am
77:52 - I going to use for reacts what am I
77:54 - going to use to manage you know data how
77:57 - what am I gonna have for a back-end you
77:59 - know it's just there's so many options
78:03 - now and so many good options that it can
78:07 - be confusing to someone maybe they're
78:09 - coming from a different area of
78:10 - programming where there are clear
78:13 - frontrunners you know it's more like
78:15 - okay everybody does it this way they
78:18 - come here and it's like the Wild West of
78:20 - programming where you know anybody can
78:23 - just open up a git repo with a new way
78:25 - to style react components and they've
78:29 - put it on Twitter it gets a bunch of
78:31 - retweets and now a week later that's a
78:34 - legitimate way to do it and you have you
78:37 - know good really good developers all of
78:39 - a sudden using it saying it's awesome so
78:41 - I can see that as being pretty confusing
78:45 - you know it ever even your build tools
78:48 - are we gonna use grunt the web pack
78:51 - would there's there's just so many
78:54 - options for everything the only thing
78:57 - that seems pretty standard in front-end
78:58 - world is almost everybody uses get right
79:02 - get is standard so other than that it's
79:06 - just you know everything is is just up
79:11 - for grabs I personally like that I love
79:13 - that there's so many options because
79:15 - it's not boring every project we do we
79:17 - try
79:18 - something new that's really cool so
79:21 - we're always learning so we get better
79:23 - with the stuff that we've kept them on
79:25 - in the project but then now we've added
79:27 - this other thing in so we're always
79:29 - having to learn new things I like that
79:32 - about it and you know what front end
79:35 - it's just things developed so rapidly I
79:39 - don't know I think that's that's cool
79:42 - Harshit mentioned get is used by
79:44 - everyone else too yeah I didn't mean to
79:46 - imply that gets only in the front end
79:48 - I'm just saying that's an example of
79:49 - something that is consistent among
79:53 - front-end developers is that they do use
79:55 - get I have seen like it in where I work
80:01 - the IT department doesn't use get they
80:03 - use something different I can't I can't
80:08 - remember what these fault
80:10 - I think it's fault they use visual
80:13 - sourcesafe for a while and they switch
80:15 - the vault yeah so I mean that but
80:22 - basically the point is that I could see
80:26 - why people would think it is a mess but
80:31 - once you get an idea of I don't know
80:36 - once you start to learn more about it
80:38 - and you can kind of visualize where
80:43 - everything falls into place and where
80:45 - the options are you know what the
80:46 - options are like I think it makes a lot
80:49 - more sense so at first it's definitely
80:54 - confusing like what do I learn how does
80:57 - it all fit together like you know just
81:01 - figuring out what everything is for is
81:04 - is a big step right they the names don't
81:08 - always say what these things are for or
81:10 - what they do anyway that's that's kind
81:15 - of my viewpoint on it but as I said I I
81:18 - really don't know what the intentions
81:20 - are beyond you know everyone that says
81:22 - that
81:38 - I lost my place in the lab chats I'm
81:40 - scrolling through now trying to find
81:42 - where I was
82:02 - Bhupinder says which software are you
82:06 - using to share screen or record the
82:09 - screen it's called OBS so it's free and
82:14 - it's available for Mac and I believe
82:17 - Windows as well I haven't tried to use
82:20 - it on Linux I think it's available for
82:22 - Linux but some of you people use Linux
82:26 - let me know if it's available for Linux
82:27 - as well I don't want to mislead anyone
82:29 - but it takes a little while to get used
82:32 - to the settings and to get them just
82:34 - right but once you get the settings down
82:36 - it's it's really easy to use I recommend
82:39 - just finding someone else who hasn't set
82:42 - up properly and trying to get their
82:46 - settings and just copy it and then you
82:47 - can adjust them based on what you need
82:50 - but that's what I did I went out and
82:52 - watched videos from from gamers who were
82:55 - doing live streams and just kind of
82:57 - tried to figure out okay what do I need
82:58 - from there and adjusted it so like I
83:01 - don't really need 60 frames per second
83:03 - for what I do so that's something I can
83:06 - back down on whereas gamers generally
83:09 - prefer that so just kind of adapt it to
83:12 - your needs if you're interested in using
83:14 - it
83:30 - origin says what's the best way to
83:33 - integrate react with an external API it
83:39 - depends on so alright it depends on a
83:43 - couple of things like if you're trying
83:44 - to grab data from an external API and
83:46 - you want it to be server-side rendered
83:47 - then I would use something like next
83:51 - that handles a lot of that for you
83:53 - and then you can use what's built in
83:56 - from next to be able to grab that data
83:57 - and render server-side if that really
84:00 - doesn't matter I would just use fetch
84:02 - you could fetch client-side or
84:04 - server-side whatever you want so there's
84:07 - a node fetch that you can use as well
84:09 - but yeah just use the fetch API and I
84:12 - think that's that works well for for me
84:21 - someone mentions harsh mentions Axios
84:25 - yeah you people have used Axios as well
84:28 - I personally don't use Axios but a lot
84:31 - of people like it so I can't really
84:33 - explain why you would want to use it
84:35 - because I don't I haven't used it but
84:37 - that's another option instead of fetch
84:43 - that's another area where it's like the
84:47 - question was what's the best way and we
84:50 - automatically have two really good ways
84:52 - to do it
84:52 - that's like what's the best way I don't
84:55 - know but I'm sure we could debate and
84:58 - then somebody else will throw in by the
85:00 - time we're done with the debate we'll
85:01 - have even more options and no clear
85:03 - winner so that's just the way things are
85:06 - in JavaScript world right now
85:19 - Aniki said thanks for the explanation I
85:22 - assume it was about the CSS stuff you're
85:23 - welcome no problem Gregory says I'm new
85:27 - to this chat where did you get the
85:28 - Pomodoro timer
85:31 - Harshit made the Pomodoro timer so harsh
85:35 - it mentioned that in the lab chat yeah
85:37 - but our should actually made it so yeah
85:41 - it's let me get the URL for you it's pom
85:45 - pom now SH that's P om p om pom pom now
85:51 - SH and I will copy and paste that into
85:53 - the live chat so you can click I want to
85:56 - make sure I read it out as well for
85:58 - those who are gonna be watching later
85:59 - who or who can't access the live chat
86:01 - right now John Henson says globally set
86:11 - small zero margins top and bottom on all
86:15 - text tags and HR it's easy to find a
86:18 - sweet spot and if you have three or four
86:20 - media queries you can change these
86:21 - margins using e/m is helpful to its
86:23 - dynamic okay just think about that so
86:29 - yeah I mean I think there's definitely a
86:31 - lot more testing and work to be done CSS
86:36 - wise to make sure this all this all
86:39 - looks alright but as I said a lot of
86:42 - what we're bringing in now is acceptable
86:44 - not exactly where I want it but I can't
86:49 - I can't start to perfect this until I
86:51 - make sure I have all the data the number
86:53 - one thing now is is there readable data
86:56 - here for every page and have I kept the
87:01 - URLs intact as much as possible that's
87:05 - number one priority after that if that's
87:08 - finished then I can start to get into
87:12 - things like you know it business look
87:15 - exactly how I want it to look or you
87:18 - know whatever else we want to want to
87:20 - work on
87:37 - harsh asks is there anything that you
87:39 - use to design sites like overall color
87:42 - scheme and other typography and stuff I
87:45 - use material design for almost all of my
87:50 - sites some side projects I do like I
87:53 - just experiment with different things
87:54 - but for my professional projects I
87:57 - usually stick with material design the
88:00 - color schemes so I work for University
88:02 - the color schemes that I use for the
88:05 - University all come from the official
88:07 - palette which was developed by one of my
88:11 - colleagues here at where I work so I'm
88:16 - kind of bound to that now the way I use
88:20 - those colors and the amounts you know
88:22 - that's up to me so I've had some trial
88:24 - and error with that but to get to the
88:26 - point where we have this this color
88:28 - scheme that we're using right now like
88:31 - this you know that that was essentially
88:35 - just trial and error and seeing what
88:37 - looks good what doesn't look good and
88:39 - starting to get a feel for like what
88:41 - colors can go up against each other and
88:43 - look okay and which ones can't alright
88:46 - so like you the green color actually
88:49 - doesn't look good right up against a
88:51 - white background so it's always bordered
88:53 - by the gold which you can see in the
88:56 - footer here even a tiny Goldwater makes
89:01 - a huge difference so as you start to
89:04 - work with a color palette you do get a
89:06 - feel for it but then just for a lot of
89:09 - different things like the shadow
89:11 - you know menu styles and things icons I
89:15 - pull a lot from the material design
89:18 - philosophy so even like the way the way
89:22 - inputs behave you know Google's put a
89:25 - lot of time and money and there are a
89:27 - lot of very experienced talented people
89:30 - that have developed material design so I
89:33 - can't compare with that so I'm going to
89:36 - use that it provides a very familiar
89:39 - user experience so I love the idea that
89:43 - a user can come to my site and
89:45 - immediately feel comfortable with the
89:48 - navigate
89:48 - and the visual hierarchy of things you
89:51 - know based on like the perceived depth
89:53 - of elements on the page with the shadows
89:55 - so I'd like to use that for my side
89:59 - projects sometimes I like to be pretty
90:02 - experimental like I like to give a retro
90:04 - look to things and I kind of mess with
90:08 - like dark color themes a lot as well so
90:11 - I'm a little bit more playful and
90:13 - creative when it comes to that but if I
90:16 - happen to have a client on the side
90:17 - usually like when it comes to colors I
90:19 - am also bound by whatever their branding
90:23 - is most companies already have that so
90:26 - you work with what you have there
90:33 - usually if a client has it one or two
90:36 - colors that are just really ugly you you
90:39 - just use them as sparingly as possible
90:41 - so I prefer the use of white a lot when
90:48 - I'm dealing with things like that so I
90:50 - personally I love dark themes but I just
90:52 - I don't know they don't always work and
90:56 - clients usually don't like them that
90:58 - much like sometimes I've had clients ask
91:01 - for a darker theme but then once they
91:03 - see it next to the white theme they they
91:05 - don't like it I don't know what that I
91:07 - don't know why it's not every client but
91:10 - there's just for some reason you know
91:14 - people seem to like the the white
91:38 - all right I think I've gotten through
91:40 - all the questions now so cool all right
91:45 - innocence I like the design of the site
91:47 - thanks Anna I appreciate that that's
91:51 - that's one of the things that it's
91:54 - always difficult I think to work with
91:57 - design people by that I mean that
91:59 - clients and things always have a lot of
92:01 - opinions about what they like I think at
92:06 - the end of the day the thing to keep in
92:07 - mind is the client the user right not
92:10 - not not the client but the you the end
92:13 - user so your clients clients right
92:17 - that's who you want to think about and
92:20 - for me
92:22 - usability always takes a higher place
92:26 - than just style alone sometimes I get
92:30 - ideas from clients that are really cool
92:35 - that stylistically would look awesome
92:37 - but then if you say all right well how's
92:40 - it gonna look on a phone how's it gonna
92:42 - look on a tablet what if you put it in
92:44 - landscape you know there's these these
92:46 - things that you know sometimes people
92:50 - don't always think of so sometimes you
92:54 - have to sacrifice that creative style
92:56 - for usability and I think material
92:59 - design does that that's why I like it so
93:02 - much if it depends on what kind of site
93:09 - if let's say I was doing a personal site
93:11 - just to showcase my work or my portfolio
93:13 - I could probably get away with being a
93:16 - lot more creative and not worry so much
93:18 - about user experience but it's just you
93:24 - got to balance that so I don't think my
93:26 - sites
93:26 - most of my sites I wouldn't call
93:29 - beautiful I would maybe just got
93:32 - describe them more as like clean
93:38 - minimalist right they're just I try to
93:43 - focus them make them to the point make
93:46 - him easy to use
93:48 - I don't know I think there's beauty in
93:51 - that to see heart says okay thanks for
93:59 - the info I will look into material
94:01 - design I've never worked with it before
94:03 - yeah check it out the docks are very
94:05 - comprehensive so if you go to like the
94:07 - official Google material design Docs you
94:10 - know just read through some of their
94:11 - philosophy and click around and just
94:13 - look at their examples I really like the
94:15 - way that they they set up their their
94:18 - documentation harshest but sometimes you
94:22 - do see sites that have both creativity
94:24 - animations and responsive at the same
94:26 - time I get so jealous of such developers
94:30 - yeah you do yeah so it's always going to
94:33 - be a balance between creativity and
94:35 - usability but some people manage to
94:38 - strike that and it's the result is
94:41 - pretty amazing so it just takes a lot of
94:45 - work right so you go with something
94:47 - that's pretty standard like material
94:49 - design you can make sites faster if you
94:52 - want to do something that has a lot of
94:54 - creativity animation and stuff and still
94:56 - made it works on your different devices
94:59 - and is usable it takes a lot of time a
95:03 - lot of testing I can be confident that a
95:07 - lot of material design stuff will work
95:08 - on different devices because others have
95:10 - tested if I'm coming up with my own
95:12 - thing that all falls on me the odds of
95:16 - there being some glitches are a lot
95:18 - higher but anyway right now it just so
95:22 - happens that I don't really have the the
95:24 - freedom to do things super creative you
95:28 - know and I'm okay with that I have a lot
95:32 - of freedom and with the tools that I use
95:35 - so I'm happy with that
95:38 - but I don't know maybe one day I'll get
95:42 - more creative with the you know design
95:44 - side of things and we'll see I like
95:48 - where I'm at right now I like what I'm
95:49 - doing all right so that's that's it
95:54 - that's so add all this stuff in the live
95:56 - chat right now so I'm gonna end this
96:00 - dream now
96:01 - thank you all so much for watching
96:03 - really appreciate all the help or the
96:05 - comments questions y'all are awesome so
96:11 - I will be back tomorrow and this would
96:15 - be good if everything goes well tomorrow
96:17 - this will be a whole week of streams
96:19 - consistently around the same time so
96:22 - it's been a while since that's happened
96:24 - but anyway until tomorrow have a great
96:28 - day

Cleaned transcript:

everybody welcome to the live coding with Jesse today we're gonna switch things up a little bit from what we've been doing this week and we're gonna get back and do some UI work we'll work a little bit with CSS and with the material UI components so I noticed in yesterday's stream when we were bringing in some of the data we tried to look at the pages and some of the data was hidden because we were pulling in the styles for another page so it occurred to me after the stream that of course we're pulling in those Styles right because we copied and pasted everything from the other page into that new component so we're still importing those same styles so I thought you know the first thing that we ought to do today is go through and maybe strip out the more specific styles and have maybe one style sheet that has some of the more you know basic things that would be Universal you know across all the pages and then I'll test out some of those pages that didn't look right yesterday see if they look all right and we can always make is we can make adjustments for specific cases you know as we see them but so far most of the page have been looking alright so I don't think we'll need to adjust too much I think it's I don't have a live setup yet so let me get this ready alright hey everybody okay all right so I guess we'll get started everything looks good with the stream whatever changes I have made in the OBS settings at the beginning of the week I think that really did the trick we've had no trouble at all with the stream quality so that's that's good there was a while there or I just wasn't sure what it was gonna be like and it's Sneaky's birthday today happy birthday so Nikki or rook from the live chat is it's actually here for the stream for that's really cool that you're watching on your birthday so happy birthday again all right now y'all can see my screen so I was doing some data migration so that's why I'm here in our migrate jas file I'm gonna switch over though and show you let's see I make it a bit bigger for you all let's shrink this down and let's bring up the N grog server because in when we're doing things like this I think and rock is really helpful because I'll probably be looking at my dev tools and so if you can look you know on your screen as well it's a lot nicer alright so I am going to paste this in all right so now that links that link is available and you all can see the same site that I'm looking at that I'm running locally all right now this is our page J s component which we made and it's supposed to be just a component that can be used for a variety of content types so that's all the problem for us of you know we were making new components for every content type and we're starting to get a lot of types and a lot of components so this will save us a lot of time and clean things up it works but you can see here that we are bringing in the news CSS so news dot CSS so let's let's try to create a new CSS page now the reason we're not using something more like styled components or anything is because we're bringing in a large chunk of HTML from our database for now that's the way we have to do it eventually we can do something different with it but right now there's not enough time to get all that data reformatted so we're just bringing in the HTML as is because of that we need to use style sheets right I can't go in and add a class to something in here because the data is coming from here right I don't really know what's gonna be there you know to add a class to so we're just going to do our best to set up styles that are most likely to look good over a variety of types and then hopefully we can test enough pages to catch most of the cases this is a very large site thousands of pages so as long as we cover the pages that are most frequently viewed and I'll probably check the analytics here soon not during the stream but I mean you know within the next week or so just to doublecheck make sure that the pages that get visited the most or where we we spend the most looks like Nikki's getting errors in the console what it's your birthday you shouldn't get errors on it for your birthday let's check this out and see see if I'm getting any errors as well I'm getting some kind of errors let me refresh this and see I'm getting all right so here's what I'm getting in terms of errors I mean I can still see everything oh here we are mmhmm we have have this one that unexpected whoops you know what I've seen errors like that before I can't remember what they were though oh you know it was it just that page let me go back this axis you know it's not Texas vanishing avoiding a connection yeah all right that's odd it must be there must be something going on with what we're bringing in here on this page because it's not happening you know in this page well we'll see we'll give it a minute maybe we'll get it but it mmhmm yeah we are getting it here on this page as well so I'm not really sure what the problem is obviously it's not affecting you know the view of things and we'll just we'll keep an eye on that all right what was I gonna totally have just lost what I was gonna do now I I think I was gonna make a new CSS file I think that's what I was talking about all right so let's see our static folder so within our static folder let's make a new file and we'll name it pick page CSS so if you notice the pattern we're naming our fight our CSS files the same name as the component that they go with and we're doing the same thing with our queries we name our queries our graph QL queries the same name as the component that they go with so it can be a bit confusing when we have pages here like a page a s and a page a s so there are downsides to doing it like that but also there's no confusion about which things go together all right so since we have this component here with nothing in it we need to bring some things in so I'm going to pull in now let me compare here the Faculty CSS and the new CSS hmm I think I'm going to bring in the faculty CSS because it does not have one problematic piece which is the displaynone for their route component so let's try that out first and we'll see how it looks weird my they get closed out my new file here there we are alright I'm going to save that and then in our page das component let's bring in instead of news spring in our page dot CSS file okay so now that saves let's check it out and refresh all right so for this particular page everything looks fine I'd like to go back to that page that was giving us the issues and you know what I'm gonna make this bigger I'm gonna make this 150 it should be a little easier to see 150% of what I set the screen to I have this set to 320 pixels because as far as I know that is the minimum screen width in pixels that that's available right now for a mobile device so we don't have to worry about anything below that which is good because the the menu here just barely fits we may have to make the menu a little bit more narrow but any less than that you wouldn't really be able to shock the menu all right so let me think about all right if I hit back we'll find it because I don't remember exactly what with the page was our mission okay just you know kind of quickly glancing this is looking pretty good I don't see okay you know there's nothing really standing out is this looks awful of course if there happens to be some data that's completely missing here you know because it's hidden or something I won't really know about that let's go back hopefully we have something it's just the film studies minor alright that wasn't the one that didn't work hurry come on alright so I can't remember which one didn't work if anybody remembers which one didn't work let me know in the live chat otherwise I'm gonna try to refresh my memory by looking at our post types her shirt says academics there was a page in academics that didn't work all right let me check what content we have in academics right now to see if I can remember what it was I don't remember what it was I don't know why I really should have tried harder to remember that good have I don't know who we even have a academics page in our history here no okay the harsh it says it was academics English okay let's try that then let me see actually no I don't have any content for English under academics if it was English maybe it was under something else under departments maybe I have a departments for English all right let's see we have for the English department I don't think it was that the I don't remember ever trying to look at that mmhmm archers let's view recording a previous dream yeah I know I can do that I just don't alright let's let's do some inception style stuff here let's view the previous stream alright so hopefully we don't cause anything crazy to happen let me try to see a messed up screen there it is Austria that's what I have academics Austria courses offered alright that was way easier than I thought it would be oops I moved the wrong thing alright let's check that out there we are alright still can't see that so you have some work to do why is it still like that check out our main content and root this is what used to be displaynone it's not displayed on anymore so where is a content this is the one all right okay this is one that one of the tags is a title tag which is crazy let's see so we'll definitely need to make sure we change title tags that that should probably be just kind of a universal thing if a title tag comes through the data we definitely just switch it I think we're pretty safe to switch titles two h2s across the board let's see there is no subtitle although we probably should switch subtitle to I don't know we'll have to see what works maybe an h4 or something but see if it displays anything at all right now okay it actually does display so we don't really need to change that I'm okay with that being subtitle for now because even that that size is okay with me all right so now let's check out these tabs oh we have a title within the tabs all right so it's gonna be a little tricky I don't think we can just go with h2s all the time all right so maybe we can get yeah so its titles are displaynone by default which is that makes sense hmm I definitely don't want to leave it as title so here's what we do we can switch it up and hmm I'd really hate to have a bunch of h2s but maybe we might have to do that for now like this is not going to be the final version of this markup for now maybe we we have all h2s and then if you have h2s that are inside tabs they'll be a little bit smaller font size so that's not ideal ideal but so I mean ideally you have a hierarchy to your structure right so changing the size is not really a big deal but having that many headings on your page and saying they're all of equal weight is I mean it's just not true right the main title should be an h1 or potentially an h2 and then anything below that can't be at that same level all right so from you know and CEO point of view we're trying to tell them what the most important thing is and I'm not sure if it has an impact on screen readers or not but I suppose it couldn't hurt to be more explicit with you know this is the main heading these are the subheadings so for now we'll do the h2s we'll switch everything h2s but it's not gonna be like that forever it'll probably end up staying like that when we launch but eventually we're gonna change it okay so see we have title all right this whole thing you're just titles titles and then write title okay so I think it might not be a bad idea to bring this up here and see what they what all this markup was supposed to look like originally well Austria is gonna need to have its own post site there are a lot of Austria pages see academics but I think it's this page this one hmm that's interesting maybe the content we're dealing with isn't even actually linked anymore uh sure courses offered where did we pull that all right well in any case we're gonna display this as you know just one list let's see all right let's do that lets go to our component now we've done something similar in another component so let's find that to find that one it wasn't news let's check our news component now it wasn't news all right let's check out directories Department no I know that I did something faculty there we are okay so here's what we did so I know Harshit was talking about pulling data and changing the changing the data like as we pull it in with a regular expression that's one way to do it but I've already pulled it in and I've put in a lot of data so there's no way I'm pulling in all that data again so another way to do this you know after the fact since we already have this data is to do something like this so here I just kind of you know created this to grab the data so that same data that we would normally input here I just made a constant here that takes that data and replaces details with div class details and then puts an ending div tag where the ending details tag was and then down here we simply put content so it's it's pretty simple it's easy to tell when you look at the component what's happening so it's not a it's not a bad solution and this is something that I suppose could be you know pulled out into its own kind of utility component if there were enough things like this going on that we could reuse for now we don't really have that going on but let's take this if we see other things like a details component you know coming in that we want to change you know we could definitely reuse this at some point we might want to have just you know all content running through something like this but we don't really know what we need until we go through more of this content alright so let's go back to our pages dot j/s component and let's put some of this in here actually let me make sure where was this faculty okay it's so inside of our return is that we had it yeah goodness was in our render function I believe it was in our render function I can double check I suppose alright here we are I don't know I must have accidentally copied but I didn't want to copy okay oops I have too many pages open let's get rid of I'll say let's get rid of what we don't need there we are faculty okay so yes within our render function and not the return function there we are and blocks what's not a pad about okay all right so let's change this up and so we have title now we're going to change this well let's change the title and then here well we'll give it a class of title just so that we can remember like when we're inspecting that this used to be a title tag it should help us you know if we have to go into dev tools and try to figure out what's going on and then we'll change it to an h2 and then here we're just gonna grab let's see we're gonna put in our content oops let me copy this and paste it here there we are oh we have alright we can't use this exactly like music because we have our query okay so we just need to change where we're where we have this then so we've used the the newer way of doing a query so we need to switch this up a bit so if we put it down here now we have access to this data so you see whereas before I had that little red squiggly line because this didn't exist now we don't alright so now that constant is gonna live here within our query and then we can change it and just use content here all right so let's save see what happens let's see okay cool so look we have all this content goodness yeah we definitely want there needs to be some styling happening here so I definitely want to see I'm assuming all this was all within title tags and now it's all h2s yes so that's an H that's an H okay we're gonna get a little creative here with without we style this this is definitely going to be something that you don't normally have to do and I don't think I started now I did not start my timer let's see oh okay yeah it's definitely time for me to take a break and go back to the live chat so I'm going to do that now when we come back from our five minute break then we're gonna get in here and we're gonna style all these h2s so that they in fact do not look like h2s but instead look like a nice list so really these should probably be like a lies it should be h2 h3 el eyes we're not gonna get that right now at some point we'll have it but not right now all right so there's one question at the bottom that I'm just gonna address right now because it's very relevant so John Hanson says for future content that will live on the WordPress database will users who input new data get a set template that will keep all things consistent with the data pool yes yes definitely so when possible it will be very specific there will be certain fields that will only allow you to input certain types of data when we need more of a like a Content area that can accept HTML that will be allowed but there's not not every user will have access to do things like that and I will put in instructions so usually what I do when I make something like this and they're going to be users that are entering content on their own is I create some tutorial videos for them so I'll have either a video or a document or usually both that outlines here's what you do you know for all these different post types and then within the post types themselves I'll have instructions so that when they go to enter something into a field there'll be instructions right there below it saying here's an example of what I want so so far that's worked well I haven't with the other sites I've done like this I it's going well so for this case I'll actually have more direct contact with the people editing it because my boss will be the primary person editing it and then the other developer who works right next to me will be doing it and then student workers that will be working right outside my door so if there's any issues someone could actually you know talk to me facetoface about it but it's I'm definitely going to be very specific with the instructions so they'll be freedom to do different things where there needs to be but it'll basically be you know the fields will only accept what I want them to accept at some point and that'll probably all happen after the launch because all that stuff's like behind the scenes stuff that I can do whenever and the the user you know the ultimate user trying to look at this site may not even realize that a change has occurred all right so let me scroll up and find some questions John Hanson says looks like the dog image has been improved using background size cover though I think it also needs background position Center Center yeah it could could be I I'm not I don't usually bother doing anything with the stock images I kind of want to see what images I need to use for real but John also says add a closing X in the corner of the menu yeah I've I noticed this yesterday and I think that would be a great idea that'll probably go on the list of it's not essential to have before we launch because like the odds of somebody having a phone this narrow are pretty small I can actually look at the analytics right now and see if anybody's using a phone that small but that's pretty narrow and it would be nice to have the X we can also make this a little bit smaller I mean really there's no reason right now but this has to be this wide but anyway I totally agree John I had the same thought brooke says isn't the menu itself swipeable on most material design apps yeah it usually is swipeable I don't I was not able to swipe this but it could be because I'm not actually on a device alright now that I think about that I should check this since we have n grok running let me let me just grab the end Rock link and I'm not going to try to type it out I'm gonna send it to myself let's see it's the easiest way to centers I'll just put it my Google keep all right so Google keep is a notetaking app and it syncs up pretty quickly so hopefully it syncs immediately now and I can just open this up on my phone because if it's if it is swipeable then that's good to know I still like the idea of having an icon there just to be sure that it's you know hundred percent clear to users but users may also if they're used to being able to swipe in they can't swipe that's going to be an annoyance to them it's not swipeable right now so when we've done things with materialized CSS that is swipeable but right now this is not swipeable also that doesn't look it's much more noticeable that there's not enough padding at the top on mobile right here so I definitely need to make sure you get some padding but that's the type of thing that I'm going to be doing in the streams for at least today and tomorrow is really working on some of those little details especially on the home page yeah we'll have to check maybe there's an issue with material I already open about being swipeable if not you know maybe that's something that we can create and maybe submit a pull request for material UI to do that I mean that that seems like a pretty common design pattern for material design apps that should be there so Niki thanks that was a yeah Niki thanks for bringing that up all right I need I need to take my sweater off because it's super hot in my office now my office the rest of the department is actually pretty like cold the right outside my door is really cold the girl who works she kind of has like an open office thing going on but the girl who works right outside my door always has a blanket because it's so cold but my office is always really warm and it's all the screens all the screens create a lot of heat so a sweater is appropriate for everywhere else except through my office I don't want to run the fan because you know it would mess up the audio as soon as it streamed over I'm definitely running the fan though alright hey in this here hey and how's it going and this will be the last question and then I'll go back to the code because my timer did run out but in it says how is your working day not too bad today I had a meeting so every Thursday morning we have a department meeting and basically everybody in my department which is about I don't know about a dozen people sometimes not everyone is there but about a dozen people and we just quickly go over what we're working on sometimes it can get a little bit long so I'm not I'm not a big fan of the weekly meeting I always keep mine short so today mine was most of what I said was just I've been working on this site so that was my day but I did get some more data transferred over which was nice I was actually up at like 1000 till 400 this morning and I I couldn't go back to sleep so I just got up got a good workout in made a latte I ate a bunch of eggs for breakfast and still managed to get my kids ready and get them to school on time and get myself into work so so not not a bad day although right now I already feel tired in a couple hours I'll be ready to go to bed cuz I've been up since before 400 but anyway thank you for asking and and I know it's it's on the live chat so I usually don't ask you how things are going but I will now so how's everything going with you you don't have to say in a live chat if you don't want if you grab their answer on insta or Twitter or something let me know but I feel bad you're always very considerate and asking how I am and I usually don't during the live chat ask ask you so anyway if you feel like sharing please let me know let's see alright a related followup question there is sim sim Ranjit says how is your worklife balance and sim Ranjit if I messed up the pronunciation of your name please let me know I really want to get it right right now my worklife balance I think is pretty good I went on home I've been doing very little work sometimes I was still like message about projects and things but I try not to actually do any coding at home right now and just spend time with my kids so it's like it's been not bad I've been reading to the kids and oh cool I got cimarron G's name right awesome so I've been spending time you know read to the kids and hold the baby a lot and I've been playing we got a Nintendo switch for Christmas so I'll play that with the kids and we it's fun because we talked about it you know you know we'll say like hey you know I got this today on this game and and that's kind of fun to have like a common interest you know with the kids so so that's cool and I've been getting my workouts in so this is two weeks on Monday so over two weeks now that I worked out every morning so I started out in some I've been doing cardio and now I started adding some some weights and things so it's not bad I actually gained like five pounds since I started working out normally you work out you want to lose weight but I I assume I'm gaining muscle because I'm working out and I'm actually eating slightly healthier than I normally do so anyway I think my balance is going well right now hopefully I can keep it up and the key for me I think the key change that I've made is I'm going to bed early and consistently so I rarely stay up past like 930 sometimes I'm in bed before 900 basically when I put my kids to sleep I go to sleep too when they're brushing their teeth or tonight I'm brushing my teeth and we all you know just go to bed so that's it I've had to sacrifice some Netflix but I think it's worth it anyway so I took a really long time to answer that but I think questions like that are important because being a developer and being successful isn't just about the code if you are great at the code but you can't keep that balance you get all stressed out you know your mental health isn't good ever your physical health isn't good then the code is gonna suffer so that can be just as important as you know you have somebody that's mentally and physically healthy who's not that good a developer right now then they have a good base to learn more but if you have somebody who's an expert but they're their life otherwise it's a mess you know I if I was gonna hire somebody I'd hire the the new person that at least has the rest of their stuff together not that I don't have concern for the other person I'd you know I'd want to help them out but if I had to choose you know for the good of a company or something that's who I'd pick so anyway I do want to make sure I have content that you are interested in so if you'd rather hear less or more about the the other part of a developer's life the you know physical social you know mental let me know I can talk about that more I'll try to make sure that I save that for the end though because there are some people that really just want the code and I know they probably get annoyed by these long breaks in the middle of all right now I don't want to make it sound like I always have everything together right I don't this just the last two weeks have been exceptional usually like for the LAT for months and months before that I just felt like I didn't have anything together and I'm sure if you asked my wife I would sound even less together than I sound right now this she sees everything from a whole different perspective so she'd probably tell you about how I bought candy a junk food for all the kids two days ago and and that kind of thing but alright let's get back to the code I'm gonna set my timer now then I'm gonna remember to bring it over here on this screen so we all can see 25 minutes we're gonna do our best to make this page look good and then check out a few other pages just to make sure we haven't like mess things up on those other pages and then we'll see how we're doing on time you know if we get it looking good maybe we'll just you know go back do some more question and answer and finish up the stream we'll see how it goes so if you do have a question or comment or anything you know put it in here now and then you know I will get to it in about 25 minutes alright so for now this h2 is fun I usually like things to be a bit thinner than this but I'm not gonna worry about detail like small details right now but this this heading definitely needs to be smaller so let's inspect that and that's gonna be at ABS h2 so let's go back to our CSS file to be working mainly in this file at this point and I don't think we have anything with tabs yet and let's see what we kind of wonder if we really need this on these pages name phone email CV link video image blockless for details right home logs hmm I I want to see if we're accidentally hiding anything so I'm gonna comment that out right now all right it doesn't look like we're hiding anything else so that's that's good I just want to see what we're hiding if we're hiding anything so let's do what was it tabs yeah tabs and then we're gonna do h2 right so in in CSS land why am i all abilities empty this is how we select an h2 that is a child of tabs and is this is this direct child I believe it's the direct child of tab so that we do want to use that we can take advantage of the cascading nature CSS here to make sure that those sub h2s that we're gonna get to in a minute actually are getting the correct styles so it won't really matter one way or another but let's let's try this let's try pixel oops font size and let's give it 24 pixels oops 24 pixels for now that may be too big we'll see and then our font weight let's go with 400 for now and I'm not worried about colors so much we may get to that but let me see what the color is now I don't want it to be solid black so as long as it's not solid black I'm okay with it where is h2 computed huh that's interesting I wonder maybe if there's no color set at all and this then is the default for the browser that's interesting all right so what I would want is color let's go yes so this this does look like it is black it it matches all these so what I really want though is to do it like this and have 87 so I'd rather have the color be 87 let's make sure okay t7 it's really hard to who uh to see a difference but that's something that I want to apply across the board I'm not going to worry about it right now but let's see tabs h2 you know what what we just did should have applied let's make sure I'm in the right file page so CSS why did it not apply with what's going on tabs h2 let me see I'm gonna check the live chat and maybe I made something different maybe I messed something up I mean soy su I would paramount uhhuh this is interesting so so does the space actually matter I was under the impression that this the space didn't matter but let's let's try it out and see so the first way I did it didn't have any effect at all now let's see let's try again maybe I was mistaken I think you all are right the space mattered very interesting for some reason I just didn't think the space mattered I just thought that was commonly how you wrote it all right cool very good to know so in case you didn't catch that originally I had written this tabs and then you know the this little was that a greater than sign yeah a little greater than sign and then h2 but I had spaces between that but that was not the correct way to do that so all right cool so that works let's see how it looks all right I'm I like that yeah I like that I think that's it's not bad I do want to see what the font size for this is 24 and I don't want them to be the same so let's drop that down then let's drop this one down to my don't we say 20 let's try 20 see how that looks alright um I still I don't really like that but I'll I'll go with that for now maybe once we drop these down in size it'll it'll look more reasonable all right also thanks to everyone that pointed out that that space matters I see several of you were we're talking about the spaces on Hill and Nikki and I'm not sure who else all were saying that but everybody who was thank you all right so let's check this now and first we'll test out some styles here and see see how we like it see if we can get mmm no it's not exactly what I want h to title alright let's go with left and put that there type that up to 22 and then we're also gonna have a right H to title alright we'll give it a quick refresh just to make sure okay that's a little bit more obvious the hierarchy that we have here and let me give it a scroll just to see what else we have going on here all right so we have another header it says fall only spring only okay now obviously we have a problem with spacing right so let's let's deal with our spacing issues why do we have spacing issues like this is that these these be ours there we go oh yeah we're gonna have to set the BR displaynone I really I hate to do that because there may be very meaningful you know break tags that are in here but it just it seems like from what I've seen of the content the break tags are not meaningful so I think we're better off displaying none on the break tags and then when we need to we'll add in padding with our CSS that's the way I prefer anyway yeah all right so this is looking a lot better not a hundred percent what I would want this there's still some some spacing issues but so much better so let's make sure we do a br nun which I think we already had down here did we we did so we already had that be our nun so I still want to leave this commented out for now because I'd like to know if we're hiding anything else but I'm gonna add that BR now so the BR set to none won't actually hide any content anyway it'll just get rid of space so I'm okay with having that as displaynone all right all right so sometimes I get a red line and I think is just delayed that it shouldn't be there anymore it just hasn't left yet all right just doublecheck make sure it works yep that works and what do you think you know what this is probably throwing me off that I haven't zoomed in alright that's that definitely looks more reasonable I think what we ought to do though is make sure that there's a bit more space so let's see what we have going on here in each tab I think each tab should have some padding or some margin at the bottom bottom and let's make it 16 pixels okay let's see what's going on it's basically done nothing there we are okay okay let's throw this in here as well all right our CSS definitely could use some better organization but I'm always I'm okay with letting that go until we get farther along sometimes if you organize prematurely then you need to just reorganize everything again so I'd rather not rather kind of wait till we get more out there all right I I don't love this this right now I think I think that there's still not enough distinction between these headings and the actual content so I either need to make this font size smaller which I don't really want to do I think 18 pixels is kind of the minimum I'd like to go here so the alternative would be to make this h2 larger and then I can make these ones larger as well so maybe I'll do that I'm just not sure I don't want to think about that let's see if you want to see how I'm on time okay so about 10 minutes left all right maybe let's let's try it then we can just try it here dev tools and see see what we want to do for 1.5 um so what's the computed all right 24 I'm sorry I knew that already I don't know I forgot all right so let's try this font size 26 pixels let's try 28 all right 28 pixels and then we can make these 24 let's see if that is enough for me yeah I think that's that's a lot more significant that stands out the only other thing that I think might work as well is let's try out let's try our font weight here we can try 300 I like that I really like that what do you all think about this these changes here I still don't like this bold being this being that bold but I really like the thin font let's see what the font size or font weight is here 700 Wow no wonder that so thick I yeah 500 is way more reasonable yeah I usually never go above 500 for font weight okay all right so let's change this then and so our h2s are gonna be CSS is so messed up it is bothering me but I'm gonna I'm gonna hold back the urge to change it and right now font size and font weights and then we changed our font size here to 24 and we changed our font weight here to 300 and let's refresh just to be sure excellent all right now it is much more obvious with the hierarchy of this pages alright cool I'm really glad that I didn't just leave that alone sometimes not being satisfied with your design is is not the right way to go because you spend too much time on it but in this case this this worked out so I don't know I think that's kind of thing is sometimes if if you work on something enough you start to get a feel for something like this isn't a big deal don't waste your time on it or this is a big deal and you don't always you know you don't always choose the right thing all the time but in this case it didn't take that long and I think the result is a lot better than what we had just a few minutes ago you check my time are at six minutes alright so now that we have this I think we ought to check out what's going on now with some of the other pieces of content so I'm just gonna go back through here the some of what we had and scroll all right this one doesn't seem to have any area here's some some headings let's see what these are these HT yeah these are h2s okay not bad I'm actually okay with the way this look I think those are fun and what's this this might not even be a H tag at all in h4 okay all right okay that's not too bad all right so it looks like we the hierarchy is there the hierarchy works I oh that's way too small notice that in H five all right so I'm definitely gonna have to take a look at the the H tags overall kind of the global settings for the H tags and then change them based on what our base font weight is which our base font weight should be at the minimum 16 all right so we do have 18 I'm okay with that actually like 18 B in the base so if 18 is our base font weight or I'm sorry font size then the h5 s can't be right now can't be 13.2 eight pixels so we they have to be at least you know 20 right does that make sense that you know any heading no matter H five or whatever it still needs to be bigger than the base want okay let me check the check because I think I asked you all what you thought about that and I didn't even check for the answer I apologize Joan Anson says looks good for the fun weights now and it says I think displaynone is a bad idea and I'd like to know why what what's your reasoning for thinking it's a bad idea would it be better to just remove those BR tags because I'm open to doing that as well I mean the easiest way to do it is with CSS but the easiest ways of course not always the best way so I would I would like to know the the thoughts behind that okay all right if you have asked a question I haven't got to it yet just about four more minutes and I'll get to all the questions so please be patient what are these they're lies okay so it looks like the Allies have a different font weight but these ones don't what are these so it our ordered lists have a different different styles than our unordered list so I'll probably want to change that at some point I don't think I'm going to try to get into it right now because we don't have that much time but and I just want to check some of these other ones as well let's see alright here's our about page so we have this this ought to be an h2o and h1 okay I'm gonna have to make a decision and see like what do we do we want to have some consistency with these so I think there ought to be if possible but other than that I like out of this shows up right now yeah that page is good this associate page I think that what's wrong with this page do we not have a title at all huh I may have to check out this page on the on the site right now and see if there's a title because that looks odd it's h3 at the top yeah I think we definitely want to make sure that all pages have a title and I'm you know this obviously this is a subtitle so I just need to make sure it looks like the title doesn't exist in the main data so maybe I will just pull in it's different for different pieces of content so it's it's going to be a little tricky because sometimes in the main content there's it already includes the title and sometimes it doesn't so I don't want to get duplicate titles so I can't just add a title in across the board like pull win the word press post title so yeah I'm gonna have to think about I'm gonna have to figure out which post types are pulling in titles automatically and which ones are and then go from there okay only have about a minute left I think we've checked enough pages now I've got h2 h3 okay not too bad all right not bad this is all these are all acceptable I wouldn't say that it's exactly how I would do it if I was doing this all from scratch and had complete freedom over how this displays but considering that we put in all this HTML from this old system that had been put in by you know a variety of different people over years by I think it's displaying you know quite well so or at least well enough that I'm comfortable with something that looks like this you know being what we launched with okay all right Anna just explained so she's saying if I want to use BR in articles I cannot because you hit it globally that's a good point you know that's a good point I just all right now let's think about that we need some way to get rid of all that space that's coming with those those BR tags but at the same time do we want to give the editors the freedom to add in their own tags and and have that be respected I'm gonna have to think about that I just I've I thought up a few potential solutions but I don't think any of them are really that good I'm thinking like potentially we could still hide our the BR tags and then just have a note in the editor to let users know if you want to use a break then use this other tag and basically we'll just invent another tag and make it act like a br so I don't like that because like now users have to remember to use another tag it's problematic if you're copying and pasting code from somewhere else and trying to use that so that's why I don't like that solution although it would work it's not great the other solution is to try to go through all the data right now and remove most of the BR tags then we don't have to hide them but that solution would either I maybe there's a way to do it in WordPress and alter the database you know with one command I don't know how to do that I could maybe I could learn then there's a possibility though of us my I guess we wouldn't be getting rid of er tags where we need them because right now we're hiding them so it's the same thing it could have somebody manually go through which is going to take a while we probably won't get that done before launch cuz I don't really have anybody right now but I know I could give that task to or I can re migrate the data and at the same time strip out the BR tags which I really don't want to do all right so those are my who is that for maybe solutions I'm gonna have to think on this a little bit more the other solution is just to leave them hidden for now and then have that on the list of things for somebody to manually do when they go through the data and then whenever they get finished with that I can then remove the CSS rule that hides the BR tags and so then they'll be okay to you again that that actually might be the best solution because there won't be I don't think there will be that many changes you know that quickly to the site and hopefully I can get somebody to go through that data soon let me know what you all think I'm not I'm not a hundred percent sure about any of them any of those those options all right let me scroll up a bit and answer some more questions that'll be it for the coding part of this so if you don't want to stick around for the question and answer thank you so much for watching but if you do have a little bit more time and you can stick around I definitely appreciate it if you would and help answer some questions and you know ask some of your own if if you'd like Aaron Arun Monterey our UN let me know that pronounce that says says hey oh hey how's it going thanks for for watching okay there's a little conversation going on here between Nikki and and on how about CSS so I think it would be worthwhile for me to put this in the video for those year watching later so let me just type a little bit in here so the question is what's the difference between this tabs h2 and tabs h2 so and this one on hell is explaining this in here so I'm not gonna read it out word for word I'll just kind of demonstrate here this first one only selects the tabs that are a direct descendant of the h2 right so there's you don't go down any more levels it would have to be tabs and then right after that h2s so even if there's like five h2s as long as they're just a child a direct child all those eight shoes will be selected but tabs h2 will select children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren all the way down so you could have tabs and then a div and then within that div in h2 it will still be selected so with the first one it wouldn't be selected if it was inside a div the second one it would and it could be inside 50 dense or nested and it would still be selected all right hopefully that makes sense to you all let me know if it doesn't but there's our CSS lesson of the day brought to you by own hell thank you very much grim reaper says why is it said that frontend web development is pretty messed up I don't I don't know I think people here's my guess I obviously don't know what the intentions are of the people who say this but based on what I've seen of people saying that and similar things my guess is that there is so there are so many different options and there's not there's usually not one clear frontrunner for how to do pretty much anything in frontend you know from you know what UI framework am I going to use to MIT you SAS les post CSS styled components glamour you know it there's so many options you know what routing am I going to use for reacts what am I going to use to manage you know data how what am I gonna have for a backend you know it's just there's so many options now and so many good options that it can be confusing to someone maybe they're coming from a different area of programming where there are clear frontrunners you know it's more like okay everybody does it this way they come here and it's like the Wild West of programming where you know anybody can just open up a git repo with a new way to style react components and they've put it on Twitter it gets a bunch of retweets and now a week later that's a legitimate way to do it and you have you know good really good developers all of a sudden using it saying it's awesome so I can see that as being pretty confusing you know it ever even your build tools are we gonna use grunt the web pack would there's there's just so many options for everything the only thing that seems pretty standard in frontend world is almost everybody uses get right get is standard so other than that it's just you know everything is is just up for grabs I personally like that I love that there's so many options because it's not boring every project we do we try something new that's really cool so we're always learning so we get better with the stuff that we've kept them on in the project but then now we've added this other thing in so we're always having to learn new things I like that about it and you know what front end it's just things developed so rapidly I don't know I think that's that's cool Harshit mentioned get is used by everyone else too yeah I didn't mean to imply that gets only in the front end I'm just saying that's an example of something that is consistent among frontend developers is that they do use get I have seen like it in where I work the IT department doesn't use get they use something different I can't I can't remember what these fault I think it's fault they use visual sourcesafe for a while and they switch the vault yeah so I mean that but basically the point is that I could see why people would think it is a mess but once you get an idea of I don't know once you start to learn more about it and you can kind of visualize where everything falls into place and where the options are you know what the options are like I think it makes a lot more sense so at first it's definitely confusing like what do I learn how does it all fit together like you know just figuring out what everything is for is is a big step right they the names don't always say what these things are for or what they do anyway that's that's kind of my viewpoint on it but as I said I I really don't know what the intentions are beyond you know everyone that says that I lost my place in the lab chats I'm scrolling through now trying to find where I was Bhupinder says which software are you using to share screen or record the screen it's called OBS so it's free and it's available for Mac and I believe Windows as well I haven't tried to use it on Linux I think it's available for Linux but some of you people use Linux let me know if it's available for Linux as well I don't want to mislead anyone but it takes a little while to get used to the settings and to get them just right but once you get the settings down it's it's really easy to use I recommend just finding someone else who hasn't set up properly and trying to get their settings and just copy it and then you can adjust them based on what you need but that's what I did I went out and watched videos from from gamers who were doing live streams and just kind of tried to figure out okay what do I need from there and adjusted it so like I don't really need 60 frames per second for what I do so that's something I can back down on whereas gamers generally prefer that so just kind of adapt it to your needs if you're interested in using it origin says what's the best way to integrate react with an external API it depends on so alright it depends on a couple of things like if you're trying to grab data from an external API and you want it to be serverside rendered then I would use something like next that handles a lot of that for you and then you can use what's built in from next to be able to grab that data and render serverside if that really doesn't matter I would just use fetch you could fetch clientside or serverside whatever you want so there's a node fetch that you can use as well but yeah just use the fetch API and I think that's that works well for for me someone mentions harsh mentions Axios yeah you people have used Axios as well I personally don't use Axios but a lot of people like it so I can't really explain why you would want to use it because I don't I haven't used it but that's another option instead of fetch that's another area where it's like the question was what's the best way and we automatically have two really good ways to do it that's like what's the best way I don't know but I'm sure we could debate and then somebody else will throw in by the time we're done with the debate we'll have even more options and no clear winner so that's just the way things are in JavaScript world right now Aniki said thanks for the explanation I assume it was about the CSS stuff you're welcome no problem Gregory says I'm new to this chat where did you get the Pomodoro timer Harshit made the Pomodoro timer so harsh it mentioned that in the lab chat yeah but our should actually made it so yeah it's let me get the URL for you it's pom pom now SH that's P om p om pom pom now SH and I will copy and paste that into the live chat so you can click I want to make sure I read it out as well for those who are gonna be watching later who or who can't access the live chat right now John Henson says globally set small zero margins top and bottom on all text tags and HR it's easy to find a sweet spot and if you have three or four media queries you can change these margins using e/m is helpful to its dynamic okay just think about that so yeah I mean I think there's definitely a lot more testing and work to be done CSS wise to make sure this all this all looks alright but as I said a lot of what we're bringing in now is acceptable not exactly where I want it but I can't I can't start to perfect this until I make sure I have all the data the number one thing now is is there readable data here for every page and have I kept the URLs intact as much as possible that's number one priority after that if that's finished then I can start to get into things like you know it business look exactly how I want it to look or you know whatever else we want to want to work on harsh asks is there anything that you use to design sites like overall color scheme and other typography and stuff I use material design for almost all of my sites some side projects I do like I just experiment with different things but for my professional projects I usually stick with material design the color schemes so I work for University the color schemes that I use for the University all come from the official palette which was developed by one of my colleagues here at where I work so I'm kind of bound to that now the way I use those colors and the amounts you know that's up to me so I've had some trial and error with that but to get to the point where we have this this color scheme that we're using right now like this you know that that was essentially just trial and error and seeing what looks good what doesn't look good and starting to get a feel for like what colors can go up against each other and look okay and which ones can't alright so like you the green color actually doesn't look good right up against a white background so it's always bordered by the gold which you can see in the footer here even a tiny Goldwater makes a huge difference so as you start to work with a color palette you do get a feel for it but then just for a lot of different things like the shadow you know menu styles and things icons I pull a lot from the material design philosophy so even like the way the way inputs behave you know Google's put a lot of time and money and there are a lot of very experienced talented people that have developed material design so I can't compare with that so I'm going to use that it provides a very familiar user experience so I love the idea that a user can come to my site and immediately feel comfortable with the navigate and the visual hierarchy of things you know based on like the perceived depth of elements on the page with the shadows so I'd like to use that for my side projects sometimes I like to be pretty experimental like I like to give a retro look to things and I kind of mess with like dark color themes a lot as well so I'm a little bit more playful and creative when it comes to that but if I happen to have a client on the side usually like when it comes to colors I am also bound by whatever their branding is most companies already have that so you work with what you have there usually if a client has it one or two colors that are just really ugly you you just use them as sparingly as possible so I prefer the use of white a lot when I'm dealing with things like that so I personally I love dark themes but I just I don't know they don't always work and clients usually don't like them that much like sometimes I've had clients ask for a darker theme but then once they see it next to the white theme they they don't like it I don't know what that I don't know why it's not every client but there's just for some reason you know people seem to like the the white all right I think I've gotten through all the questions now so cool all right innocence I like the design of the site thanks Anna I appreciate that that's that's one of the things that it's always difficult I think to work with design people by that I mean that clients and things always have a lot of opinions about what they like I think at the end of the day the thing to keep in mind is the client the user right not not not the client but the you the end user so your clients clients right that's who you want to think about and for me usability always takes a higher place than just style alone sometimes I get ideas from clients that are really cool that stylistically would look awesome but then if you say all right well how's it gonna look on a phone how's it gonna look on a tablet what if you put it in landscape you know there's these these things that you know sometimes people don't always think of so sometimes you have to sacrifice that creative style for usability and I think material design does that that's why I like it so much if it depends on what kind of site if let's say I was doing a personal site just to showcase my work or my portfolio I could probably get away with being a lot more creative and not worry so much about user experience but it's just you got to balance that so I don't think my sites most of my sites I wouldn't call beautiful I would maybe just got describe them more as like clean minimalist right they're just I try to focus them make them to the point make him easy to use I don't know I think there's beauty in that to see heart says okay thanks for the info I will look into material design I've never worked with it before yeah check it out the docks are very comprehensive so if you go to like the official Google material design Docs you know just read through some of their philosophy and click around and just look at their examples I really like the way that they they set up their their documentation harshest but sometimes you do see sites that have both creativity animations and responsive at the same time I get so jealous of such developers yeah you do yeah so it's always going to be a balance between creativity and usability but some people manage to strike that and it's the result is pretty amazing so it just takes a lot of work right so you go with something that's pretty standard like material design you can make sites faster if you want to do something that has a lot of creativity animation and stuff and still made it works on your different devices and is usable it takes a lot of time a lot of testing I can be confident that a lot of material design stuff will work on different devices because others have tested if I'm coming up with my own thing that all falls on me the odds of there being some glitches are a lot higher but anyway right now it just so happens that I don't really have the the freedom to do things super creative you know and I'm okay with that I have a lot of freedom and with the tools that I use so I'm happy with that but I don't know maybe one day I'll get more creative with the you know design side of things and we'll see I like where I'm at right now I like what I'm doing all right so that's that's it that's so add all this stuff in the live chat right now so I'm gonna end this dream now thank you all so much for watching really appreciate all the help or the comments questions y'all are awesome so I will be back tomorrow and this would be good if everything goes well tomorrow this will be a whole week of streams consistently around the same time so it's been a while since that's happened but anyway until tomorrow have a great day
