00:00 - hi in this video we are going to talk a
00:02 - little bit about source code
00:04 - what source code is where you'll see it
00:06 - and how the computer makes sense of it
00:08 - source code itself is the actual text
00:11 - document that a programmer creates they
00:13 - type it up it's letters it's numbers
00:15 - it's symbols if you give that to
00:17 - somebody and have them look at that on
00:18 - their computer that's not going to run
00:20 - their email that's not going to be a web
00:22 - browser that's just
00:24 - a text document really
00:26 - um now the computer has to have a way of
00:28 - interpreting that and making something
00:30 - really powerful run from it there are
00:33 - two main ways this is done either an
00:35 - interpreter or a compiler now in every
00:38 - internet browser that works has an
00:40 - interpreter so javascript
00:42 - is run through an interpreter to make
00:44 - sense
00:45 - other languages like c plus plus are
00:47 - used with a compiler now that's
00:50 - unlike an interpreter the compiler does
00:52 - all of its work on the programmer's end
00:55 - so they send out their package their
00:58 - their product and it's already been
00:59 - compiled it can already run on a machine
01:02 - whereas javascript and interpreter
01:04 - languages
01:05 - you just write the javascript you don't
01:07 - compile it or anything and the computer
01:09 - itself the browser has a technology to
01:12 - interpret that and make something happen
01:13 - there
01:14 - now
01:15 - there are arguments this way in that
01:17 - everybody has an opinion about which is
01:18 - better and really it's a case-by-case
01:20 - basis compiling languages and
01:22 - interpreting languages are better at
01:24 - different things as you know free code
01:26 - camp we do focus on interpreter language
01:29 - of javascript i also want to talk a
01:30 - little bit about what open source means
01:33 - just because it kind of fits in the
01:34 - language here source code open source
01:36 - free code camp is open source as are a
01:39 - lot of really awesome projects
01:41 - what open source means is that all of
01:43 - their documentation all of their source
01:45 - code is open and accessible
01:48 - uh now you may be thinking okay so what
01:51 - but what's awesome about that is if you
01:54 - have something you want to change about
01:55 - free code camper some way you think it
01:57 - could be improved write that improvement
01:59 - in and send it to us at free code camp
02:01 - and maybe get it implemented it's a
02:03 - great way to see programs grow and
02:06 - websites and products grow in a really
02:08 - really strong and fast way because there
02:11 - are so many people constantly seeing it
02:13 - and seeing how it can be improved
02:16 - the one thing that is kind of an
02:17 - unspoken rule with open source is if
02:19 - you're going to take something and
02:20 - improve it for yourself even if it's a
02:22 - piece of software that you can download
02:24 - generally you want to give that back to
02:25 - the community
02:26 - give that improvement to everyone else
02:28 - so that they can use it too
