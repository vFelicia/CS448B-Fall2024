With timestamps:

00:07 - hey everybody its Jessie and today I'm
00:14 - going to show you what I've done with
00:16 - the our server das file with trying to
00:21 - check to make sure our files are legit
00:24 - before we upload them and we had a pool
00:27 - request so Sebastian has done some work
00:30 - on client side validation I'd like to go
00:32 - over that I'm gonna try to get in to
00:35 - Pomodoro cycles worth of coding today I
00:39 - have a meeting in an hour and a half so
00:43 - won't be super long stream today but I
00:47 - think if we get into 25-minute Pomodoro
00:50 - sessions and leave the rest of the time
00:51 - for questions that that should
00:54 - definitely be enough to get in all the
00:57 - questions unless we have a lot more
01:00 - questions than normal so I'm gonna get
01:06 - right into it
01:07 - if I notice that there's a lot of new
01:08 - people in the live chat I might give my
01:10 - normal explanation of what this is and
01:14 - what's going on but otherwise to save
01:16 - time I'm just going to get right into it
01:18 - also have the Instagram live stream
01:21 - going as well so if anybody's interested
01:24 - in that not not really anything exciting
01:27 - you just get to see my face in the view
01:31 - of my office as if you were the monitor
01:36 - okay so I just committed my latest work
01:42 - and I'm gonna push it to the repo now
01:53 - okay so that is now on the file type
01:56 - check branch on the github repo the link
02:01 - is in the description so if you want to
02:03 - check this out on you know in the
02:07 - browser or cloning the repo and and try
02:11 - it out for yourself you can do that so
02:15 - basically here's here's what I've done
02:17 - and some of it might not be absolutely
02:19 - necessary but I figured you know what
02:23 - it's not like these checks are super
02:26 - resource intensive so if I leave
02:29 - something in that may not be absolutely
02:30 - necessary I'm not that worried about it
02:32 - maybe there is you know some some good
02:37 - reason to have it in there that I just
02:39 - can't think about in terms of a possible
02:43 - malicious file upload so I'll just go
02:46 - through some of the things you've
02:47 - already seen at the end of yesterday's
02:50 - stream I realized that I had made a
02:53 - mistake and I was checking for basically
02:58 - I was getting the file type the mi any
03:01 - type but I was checking it against a red
03:05 - jack a regular expression that had file
03:08 - extensions instead so obviously like
03:11 - that what it was working for pings but
03:14 - it didn't work for pretty much
03:15 - everything else and so that's why I
03:18 - hadn't noticed it until the end so now I
03:23 - have the correct checks but I've
03:24 - actually I've kept both so I'm I'm
03:27 - getting the file extension from the file
03:30 - name and I'm checking that and I'm also
03:33 - getting the file type and I'm checking
03:35 - it against the M IME types so you could
03:39 - see these are these reflect you know the
03:44 - types down here so a little bit a little
03:48 - bit longer okay but it's checking for
03:50 - the same thing and I grabbed this from
03:53 - what Sebastian was doing on the client
03:56 - side and thank you for that Sebastian
03:59 - because I was I was just getting ready
04:00 - to get these and compiled something like
04:04 - this on my
04:06 - and then I saw your pool requests and
04:08 - check that out and this just saved me a
04:10 - bunch of time and trying to do this so
04:12 - that was awesome I appreciate that
04:17 - so I'm doing those two checks and you
04:20 - can see right now I just have this if
04:23 - statement that just has a bunch of
04:25 - checks probably depending on what's
04:31 - going on and how much time I have this
04:32 - could definitely use some refactoring
04:34 - and cleaning up in fact this entire
04:36 - server das file is just getting really
04:39 - long so it could it could use some work
04:44 - I mean it's functional but it's not
04:46 - pretty right now but I'm not gonna
04:50 - bother cleaning it up until we get it to
04:52 - the point where it's working like we
04:55 - want it to work and then we can clean it
04:57 - up if anybody really likes to do the
05:00 - cleanup type of stuff
05:02 - I appreciate and welcome any any pool
05:05 - requests let me go with you other checks
05:12 - okay so I'm checking I read up on node
05:16 - security so let me show you what I found
05:21 - so I found this article and I linked to
05:27 - this here so you can check that out if
05:31 - you look on the repo so this kind of
05:34 - goes through some of the things that you
05:36 - can do to help protect against attacks
05:41 - from from file uploads and so I
05:44 - implemented some of this one thing that
05:47 - it was saying is you don't want to allow
05:49 - dots and slashes in your file names so
05:53 - I'm checking obviously we're gonna have
05:55 - one dot for the file extension right so
05:57 - I'm okay with one dot but anything more
06:01 - than one dot I'm gonna reject so this
06:04 - has dots here that's what it's checking
06:06 - for so if has dots is true meaning it
06:09 - has more than one dot then we reject the
06:11 - file similar thing with slashes but I
06:15 - don't want any slashes so if it has a
06:17 - slash
06:18 - then this will be true and we'll reject
06:21 - it the other thing that I had never
06:24 - heard of but I read about was this
06:26 - poison no bites
06:28 - so I'm not a hundred percent sure that I
06:32 - understand how to do this right like if
06:36 - I was in the place of the attacker I
06:38 - don't know how I would do this but
06:41 - basically it's a way to oops I need me
06:44 - to click on that basically it's a way to
06:48 - show one file name but that's not really
06:52 - the real file name so you could have a
06:56 - file name that passes all the other
06:58 - tests but then really the file name
07:01 - could be something that has like
07:03 - something more like this down here that
07:06 - has your dots and slashes that would
07:08 - allow the user to access directories
07:13 - that they shouldn't access ok so like so
07:18 - I guess I understand what could happen
07:20 - not really sure how is it to how to do
07:23 - that but I've added a check for this and
07:26 - so basically I just took this and now
07:29 - I'm checking here for the it's a poison
07:32 - and all bytes check so if this check if
07:36 - this is true that means it's bad and so
07:42 - we reject it so those are the that's
07:45 - everything that I've added so far I I
07:53 - think I think I'm probably gonna move on
07:58 - at this point and do some more with
08:01 - other parts of the site I need to get
08:04 - this ready to show people in my
08:07 - department and get feedback because
08:09 - there's Pro there are probably going to
08:11 - be some changes out of meeting this
08:12 - morning department meaning and went over
08:15 - some things
08:16 - the Trello board which i think is linked
08:18 - in the description has some new items on
08:21 - there for changes to content and
08:22 - additions to content so I'd like to get
08:27 - some things working and make sure that
08:30 - everything
08:31 - at least visibly is ready for people to
08:35 - give me feedback on so probably won't
08:38 - work on this again until a little bit
08:40 - later on but for now we do have some
08:42 - decent checks and protections not
08:44 - perfect but it's still not you know it's
08:48 - much better than what we had just a few
08:51 - days ago all right so now I'm gonna go
08:55 - to the client side and I just realized
08:58 - that I forgot to set my Pomodoro timer
09:00 - so I'm about ten minutes in yeah I guess
09:05 - I'll just set it and I also set it for
09:10 - the full 25 and if we get down to it and
09:12 - there's a few minutes left I may just
09:15 - stop it a bit early so let me let me
09:22 - just show you I'm gonna have to switch
09:25 - let's see
09:32 - let me check the live chat I just
09:34 - realized that I hadn't even looked at it
09:36 - at all yet so hey everyone
09:40 - Oh Oscar says hello from Venezuela hey
09:43 - welcome he says these videos have been a
09:46 - great help to me thank you so much hey
09:47 - you're welcome I'm really glad that
09:50 - they're helpful to you that when I hear
09:54 - stuff like that it makes me want to keep
09:56 - going keep doing doing these videos so
09:58 - that's awesome okay Sebastian said okay
10:06 - here's some good stuff let me explain
10:08 - this so Sebastian had a question here
10:09 - and I want to explain this I forgot I
10:12 - forgot that I did this so Sebastian's
10:14 - version of this was a little bit bigger
10:17 - so it had things like application so all
10:22 - of them had this kind of first part here
10:26 - and Sebastian was asking does it work
10:30 - without that and it does if you do so
10:33 - what I'm doing up here from my file type
10:36 - is I'm only getting what's after that
10:39 - slash right so that's why I was able to
10:43 - leave off all the other things so if you
10:47 - look at what Sebastian did on the pool
10:49 - request
10:50 - I think it's pool requests 56 yeah I
10:54 - think 56 and I think it's Sebastian
10:58 - actually a tool to pull request 55 did
11:01 - get merged into master and that fixed an
11:04 - error that was happening in the console
11:07 - that had to do with IDs on input fields
11:10 - so thank you for that Sebastian but
11:13 - anyway that's why it works because I'm
11:16 - not getting the entire file type I'm
11:19 - splitting that and just getting that
11:21 - last part
11:23 - so either way would work it just depends
11:26 - on what your you're checking it against
11:28 - so in this case I'm checking it against
11:32 - the file type which is just really just
11:36 - the last part of the file type so
11:39 - hopefully that makes sense okay cool
11:41 - Sebastian says I got it yeah so sorry
11:44 - about that I had four
11:46 - didn't I didn't even remember that I did
11:48 - that so yeah but like I said the other
11:54 - way to work okay Sebastian also said he
12:00 - doesn't think that he got all of them
12:01 - skipped a few okay cool I'll just have
12:03 - to go through actually I found a site
12:05 - that has it it seems like it says that
12:09 - it has all the different M IME types so
12:12 - I'll go through and check it out it
12:16 - looks like you you definitely got most
12:17 - of them but I'll double check and go
12:20 - through go through that site
12:31 - okay so patrick has a few a few tips for
12:40 - me here actually Sebastian poison the
12:43 - lights
12:43 - listen to my shake
12:50 - Patrick when you said when you're
12:52 - talking about the poison no bites check
12:54 - I'm not sure what your your meaning
12:57 - there when you have it twice with like
12:59 - the little arrow in between it so I'm
13:02 - sorry I'm just not understanding so you
13:04 - get explain that a little bit more I
13:05 - would appreciate it okay Patrick also
13:08 - says Patrick says also I have multiple
13:11 - dots and found in it's pretty often
13:12 - which you should be concerned with this
13:14 - double dots that's a really good point
13:19 - oh did I just misspell poison is that
13:27 - the problem okay I see it I see now that
13:31 - it was spelled differently let me see P
13:37 - man thanks for
13:50 - okay thank you
13:55 - that's funny yesterday I came home and
13:59 - my wife said she was working on a free
14:00 - code camp problem the one about
14:03 - converting Celsius to Fahrenheit and
14:07 - it's one of the early JavaScript dog
14:09 - algorithms and she said she'd been
14:11 - working on it for a long time I think
14:13 - she said like 45 minutes she couldn't
14:14 - get it to work so she wanted me to look
14:17 - at it so I looked at it for a little
14:18 - while and and probably just a few
14:22 - minutes and I went through everything
14:23 - and it was like yeah you know this this
14:26 - should work what's what's going on and
14:27 - she had just spelled Celsius wrong so
14:31 - that was that was the problem she has
14:33 - about two different ways so it kept
14:35 - saying it was undefined inside the
14:38 - function she was trying to pass in
14:40 - Celsius as a parameter right and so
14:44 - anyway that was the whole problem so and
14:46 - I told her don't worry about it that
14:48 - happens to me all the time in front of
14:49 - everybody on YouTube so don't be don't
14:52 - be embarrassed and here it just happened
14:56 - less than 24 hours after that so anyway
15:04 - I always appreciate that when when you
15:06 - all catch that so I mean in this case it
15:08 - wouldn't everything still would have one
15:10 - run properly because I had misspelled it
15:13 - consistently but it's still good
15:15 - haven't spelled right
15:40 - all right sorry about it I just kept a
15:44 - bunch of messages this came up in my
15:46 - slack for my department
15:48 - I just wanted to skim through quickly
15:50 - and see if there was some sort of
15:51 - emergency it looks like
16:04 - okay it looks like it's fine so alright
16:12 - so I think we got we've got the spelling
16:16 - sorted out I'll Det I'll go back and
16:19 - double-check and make sure we're
16:20 - covering all the types that we want to
16:22 - cover here and now let me show you
16:25 - what's going on with the client-side
16:29 - validation so I'll bring this over so
16:40 - you can see I'm gonna check out a
16:42 - different branch so let's do check out
16:47 - and I named this oops hold on a second I
16:53 - have to get a knock at the door
17:18 - okay I'm back let's see okay so I need
17:31 - to check out to a different branch and I
17:34 - can't remember what the name of that was
17:36 - there we go okay so now we're on this
17:43 - branch and I can bring over okay
17:53 - so looks like it's working let me bring
17:55 - this over all right so I'll show you
17:58 - what it's doing first like what a user
18:00 - would see and then we can check out the
18:02 - code you can see the code I think I
18:06 - mentioned earlier it's pool request 56
18:09 - will show the the new code that's been
18:11 - put in by Sebastian so you can see now
18:16 - like if I try to put in numbers for my
18:19 - name it'll say it's not a valid name
18:20 - same thing email right so we have
18:23 - immediate feedback which is pretty
18:26 - awesome and also if we try to submit
18:30 - without the required fields it says
18:33 - right please fill out this field so
18:36 - really useful it's it's nice to have we
18:41 - also are checking types for the upload
18:44 - so if I try to upload something that's
18:45 - not supported it won't work so let me
18:49 - see I'm assuming this isn't supported
18:51 - let's see if this works
18:54 - actually that's not working right now I
18:59 - didn't test this out earlier so but I
19:01 - know this is it's in there somewhere so
19:03 - I guess I could try this I could try to
19:06 - submit it but it's probably not gonna
19:08 - work because we're on
19:15 - I wonder what it happened okay so I
19:21 - don't know how many of these Sebastian
19:24 - made required but we need to go through
19:26 - I still need to get confirmation from
19:29 - people in my department as to what
19:31 - fields really need to be required my
19:33 - preference is to make as few fields
19:35 - required as possible so that it's easier
19:39 - for the user but I understand that there
19:41 - are some things that are really
19:43 - important to know ahead of time so we'll
19:48 - see so I can't exactly complete this yet
19:50 - and so I have that information I can I I
19:55 - have most of the information to complete
19:57 - these check boxes so that will be
19:59 - happening soon and yeah I can definitely
20:04 - at least get everything I know for sure
20:07 - will be in here and then I'll get some
20:08 - feedback on that but that's basically it
20:14 - I mean it it may not look like a lot
20:19 - right here but I'm sure as you know if
20:22 - you've done something like this it's not
20:23 - it's not just simple to do that there's
20:26 - a lot that goes into it so let me show
20:28 - you just a little bit about how this was
20:32 - done so if we check out our package.json
20:34 - you'll see we have formzee react in form
20:38 - z material UI so this is really nice and
20:40 - helpful there's already a library that
20:42 - does validation and it integrates with
20:46 - material UI so that takes care of so
20:49 - much for us that was a really good job
20:53 - finding that sebastian i i've a glee
20:55 - remember looking into form z maybe
20:58 - months ago for something and i
20:59 - completely forgotten about it so i would
21:02 - have tried to have done this completely
21:04 - on my own had you know i found that and
21:07 - that would have taken much longer so on
21:12 - the service request form we're importing
21:15 - things from form z and then using them
21:19 - so our entire form then is rat this is
21:25 - getting to be a big component huh
21:28 - our entire forum then is wrapped in this
21:30 - form z form component so a little bit of
21:38 - a change in the way this this looks but
21:42 - in terms of you know on this end of
21:45 - things but pretty much everything inside
21:49 - so I get about the same right we have
21:52 - some some change right so form Z check
21:55 - box right so we do have some things that
21:57 - are at least for the words you know the
22:01 - names of the components are slightly
22:03 - different but not too not too bad in
22:08 - terms of trying to implement this so
22:11 - this is not it I'm just going over it
22:13 - this is not everything that Sebastian
22:16 - did so I'm going over this quickly so we
22:18 - can move on to some other stuff but you
22:22 - can see forms use a really good way to
22:24 - do this and it's not like you don't have
22:29 - to know a lot about form validation
22:31 - yourself to implement some of this which
22:35 - is really cool
22:50 - okay
22:53 - all right so let's check out what we can
22:59 - do now on the Trello board so like I
23:03 - said I'm going to kind of move this back
23:06 - a bit and go go back to it just so at
23:09 - this point I really do need some
23:11 - feedback I think I could be moving
23:16 - faster if I knew exactly what was wanted
23:18 - um I'm kind of finding more things to do
23:21 - or thank you trying to think of more
23:24 - things to do until I get the info I need
23:26 - and I haven't been super proactive and
23:28 - trying to seek out the information you
23:32 - know it's I much prefer to just be
23:34 - sitting in my office coding I've been
23:36 - trying to track down people and email
23:39 - and get the information I need so it's
23:43 - it's is partially my fault that I
23:45 - haven't been been more aggressive at
23:48 - that
23:57 - actually this will be this might be fun
24:02 - to do so I haven't done this before
24:05 - so here's what I want to do so let me
24:10 - show you where's our check boxes I don't
24:20 - know if I should do it on this branch or
24:21 - not probably not let's uh let's go to
24:32 - another branch
24:39 - this is going to be minor enough I could
24:41 - think I could just do it on master it
24:42 - should be fine
24:44 - but let me just change one of these
24:49 - checkboxes I want to change that to
24:58 - photography great so here's what I want
25:03 - to happen we have some additional
25:05 - information that needs to be displayed
25:07 - if someone selects photography so what I
25:10 - would like to happen is when they select
25:13 - photography have a modal come up or
25:17 - basically if something needs to come up
25:20 - and I'm not I'm not entirely sure what
25:24 - the best thing would be right now my
25:26 - initial thought was a modal and then I
25:27 - thought oh well you know if that modal
25:29 - pops up every time it's going to get
25:30 - annoying for people who have read it
25:32 - multiple times so then I thought perhaps
25:34 - a tooltip right so that when you put
25:38 - your cursor over top of it then it comes
25:41 - up that that could work too it's not
25:48 - it's it's probably a bit too much
25:50 - information for a tooltip though let me
25:53 - show you what the info will be just to
25:55 - give you an idea so it's gonna be this
25:59 - whole list
26:00 - I think I'm originally I was supposed to
26:04 - put the dates in here but I'm gonna now
26:06 - they want me to leave out the dates so
26:09 - this is going to be this big list of
26:11 - events and then also some explanatory
26:15 - text so I don't know I think that's way
26:19 - too much for a tooltip I think it would
26:21 - be better in a modal scrollable
26:24 - especially like on mobile it's entirely
26:28 - possible that this list could be bigger
26:30 - than the viewport so I guess I'm
26:35 - thinking more of a modal so that's what
26:41 - I need so basically when this is checked
26:43 - the modal needs to pop up and then the
26:47 - modal can be dismissed but the check
26:49 - would still be there so it's not going
26:51 - to be tied
26:52 - you know completely into the check in
26:55 - terms of you know you can uncheck
26:58 - certainly if you if you check the modal
27:02 - needs to pop up but when the modal is
27:06 - dismissed I want the check to stay there
27:09 - right
27:15 - Patrick's idea is how about an info icon
27:20 - that pops the modal independent of the
27:23 - checkbox the checkbox label I did think
27:30 - of an info icon I'm okay with an info
27:36 - icon I was kind of anticipating that
27:39 - other people in my department would not
27:41 - be okay with that but it might be worth
27:44 - it just to put it in anyway and see if I
27:46 - can find it by with that I think it's
27:49 - better and less intrusive with the info
27:51 - icon but from past experience with with
27:58 - my department there they want to make
28:02 - sure that people see things right so you
28:06 - know they want there to be no question
28:07 - that you know no one could come and say
28:10 - well I didn't know you know they want to
28:13 - be able to say well you had to have seen
28:15 - it because you couldn't have gone any
28:16 - further without seeing it right so if I
28:21 - can get it through with the icon then
28:25 - that's that's fine so let's do that
28:27 - let's put add an icon and let's make it
28:31 - so that if you click that icon then the
28:33 - modal comes up it'll be independent of
28:36 - the checkbox yeah I think that'll be the
28:43 - best the best way to do it I also think
28:48 - it might not be a bad idea if we have
28:50 - time to add in in the email so if
28:54 - photography is checked the email that
28:57 - gets sent to the user confirming their
29:00 - submission will also have that in
29:02 - about photography and that way I think
29:06 - we may get it may be okay to just have
29:10 - that that icon there because they'll
29:15 - beginning in a second time directly to
29:17 - their email yeah so I think that sounds
29:25 - sounds like it'll work let me check my
29:30 - timer before we start on this okay let
29:32 - me take my break now because if you
29:34 - remember I started my time or nine
29:35 - minutes late so let's let's take the
29:38 - five minute break now I'm gonna go to
29:40 - the Live Chat check everything probably
29:42 - won't need the whole five minutes for
29:43 - the live chat because there's not very
29:44 - many questions but then we'll come back
29:50 - and we'll we'll put this modal in so we
29:54 - do have some modal's but I don't think
29:56 - that I've done any modal's on on the
29:59 - stream I think they're all from a pull
30:00 - request so this will be cool we'll see
30:03 - how to do modal's in material UI I don't
30:09 - know probably not going to get to the
30:10 - email thing like that'll be on the list
30:12 - of things that if we have time we'll get
30:17 - to but it's not really necessary
30:19 - okay so let me go if you're not familiar
30:22 - with how the stream works I take five
30:24 - minute breaks between 25 minute coding
30:26 - sessions to go to a live chat and answer
30:27 - any questions that you might have after
30:29 - the five minute break we'll go back and
30:30 - do another session for today's stream
30:33 - I'm just going to do two sessions totals
30:35 - have one more session after this then
30:37 - we'll finish up with a
30:38 - question-and-answer session that is
30:39 - normally as long as it takes to get to
30:42 - all the questions today I do have a hard
30:44 - break though because I have a meeting at
30:48 - 3:30 Eastern Time which is in about an
30:51 - hour
30:52 - all right so let me let me scroll up
31:03 - okay Sebastian wanted me to share a link
31:06 - to the security article all right I will
31:08 - put that in the live chat now and it's
31:11 - also a comment in the server JS file on
31:14 - the the file file type check branch is
31:21 - that what I called it I think so
31:35 - yeah Jordan says what up programming
31:37 - peeves hey how's it going thanks for
31:39 - joining us
31:52 - how cool sebastian said the first to do
31:55 - is almost implemented yeah for sure
32:00 - where did I put that
32:11 - yeah anyway Sebastian I was like really
32:15 - happy when I saw your pool request
32:16 - because I was thinking like this is
32:18 - going to take a long time for me to
32:19 - implement
32:28 - wait a second it says sebastian says he
32:33 - can't find the pool request his pool
32:35 - requests on github let me double check
32:40 - which pool requests are you talking
32:42 - about the one with the client-side
32:45 - validation or the one before that so i
32:48 - guess would be 55 or 56 oh you know what
32:56 - that s client validation branch i did
32:59 - not push that up yet so it's only exist
33:02 - locally for me it's just a copy of of
33:05 - your pool request and actually i think
33:08 - it was before the last commit so it's
33:10 - not even up to date so i'll need to pull
33:12 - it down again to get the latest jonathan
33:24 - says I've just started the responsive
33:26 - design with bootstrap section on free
33:28 - code camp I have no clue what's going on
33:30 - here but I like that this is happening
33:32 - all right cool
33:33 - I'm glad you like it and feel free to
33:36 - ask any questions I'm happy to answer
33:38 - questions don't worry about if you think
33:40 - the question is you know too simple or
33:43 - something it's no questions bother me so
33:48 - feel free to ask there's a lot of really
33:50 - knowledgeable people people that know
33:52 - more than I do in the live chat that can
33:54 - help answer things as well sometimes it
33:57 - takes me a little while to get to the
33:58 - questions but I do try to answer
33:59 - everything for the stream is over and
34:02 - I'll try to explain things as best I can
34:04 - as I go along
34:14 - okay
34:26 - all right I think I got that through
34:29 - everything so okay not bad I didn't
34:35 - think you'd take the full five minutes
34:36 - but I got close so I'm gonna go ahead
34:39 - and start this timer and let's do
34:42 - another 25 minute session of coding when
34:47 - I do these sessions it's not that I
34:48 - ignore the live chat sometimes I check
34:50 - back especially if I get stuck and need
34:52 - to ask for some help but I just usually
34:56 - don't answer questions during that that
34:58 - period okay so the plan is make an icon
35:04 - when you click the icon then the modal
35:08 - comes up Sebastian I think had mentioned
35:12 - maybe hovering over the icon and have
35:15 - the tooltip up here I thought about that
35:19 - too but like I said before I think it's
35:23 - too much information for just a tooltip
35:25 - I think a tooltip would have been ideal
35:28 - if it wasn't for that giant list of
35:30 - things that needs to that needs to go in
35:33 - there so yes I think we're gonna go with
35:38 - the modal hmm let's see how we can put
35:45 - this in so right now we just have these
35:48 - strings going in I don't know if I can
35:54 - put in an icon but let's let's see if I
35:56 - can put in HTML and see what it does
36:00 - I'll just try this out first
36:14 - okay can't like that see how this is
36:17 - getting put in there all right so this
36:20 - left check boxes
36:52 - I wonder
36:58 - all right let's try to do it like this
37:00 - then instead of making it a string let's
37:04 - put this whole thing in the span
37:14 - let's see what we get
37:18 - in the whoops
37:30 - and I'm not working there
37:47 - okay
37:54 - all right so down here
38:00 - down here we're doing some things with
38:02 - that label and so that's not allowing us
38:06 - to put in what we need okay let's see
38:44 - okay so we need to find a way to pass
38:48 - and let's say you think of some way
38:50 - around it we need to be able to pass
38:52 - HTML instead of a string which we may be
38:58 - able to do but right now we are since
39:12 - we're doing this
39:33 - okay yeah we using this a lot all right
39:41 - well let's take this off of the checkbox
39:45 - you
40:36 - all right so just for this checkbox
40:39 - field just to test it I'm going to stop
40:43 - this format label to property and let's
40:53 - see
41:18 - let's just put
41:27 - all right hopefully it'll let me do this
41:30 - just so I can test this out obviously I
41:34 - don't want to keep it like this but this
41:38 - should still work for everything else I
41:41 - just needed to work for the checkboxes
41:45 - all right let's see hmm looks like it's
41:52 - not gonna work all right I'm not still
41:58 - calling this somewhere
42:11 - shouldn't be calling this anywhere else
42:13 - let's double-check
42:21 - all right so let's check it out that
42:24 - string probs okay so that shouldn't be
42:29 - doing it okay versus checkbox pros okay
42:37 - we don't adhere to all right where are
42:42 - we using checkbox probes
42:58 - yes
43:08 - alright I'm gonna I'm really gonna mess
43:12 - this up
43:13 - so I just want to test if this is even
43:22 - possible before I make really big
43:27 - changes alright let's see yes all right
43:34 - awesome so it does work right so I
43:37 - didn't do a great job explaining that so
43:39 - let me let me kind of sum up what I did
43:42 - the whole point of what I was trying to
43:44 - do is that I wanted to see if I could
43:46 - pass in HTML and have it render so I did
43:53 - so I did here so you can see there are
43:56 - spans here but they don't show up so
44:00 - that's what we want so that works now in
44:02 - the process of being able to do that I
44:04 - had this disabled a lot of other stuff
44:06 - that was going on so I may have made
44:09 - this form at least the checkbox portion
44:11 - of it useless and you can see since I've
44:14 - just given all the checkboxes the same
44:16 - name then the checks just keep the point
44:24 - like this hold on one second everyone I
44:32 - gotta take this hello hey how's it going
44:47 - you
46:06 - alright I'm back sorry about that
46:08 - today's been crazy for interruptions but
46:12 - that was I got a request to do some work
46:18 - on a site that's not really one that I
46:20 - maintain but we don't the position
46:24 - that's supposed to maintain that is is
46:26 - open right now we don't have anybody in
46:28 - there so I guess I'm gonna do it and I
46:30 - also got invited to a Labor Day picnic
46:33 - so that's cool uh-huh
46:35 - so let me see okay so I'm gonna catch up
46:44 - just quickly on the live chat because it
46:47 - looks like so Quincy's in the chat hey
46:51 - Quincy if you're still in there
46:52 - listening in the chat I did I emailed
46:57 - you back right before I started the
46:59 - stream so if you didn't get it I'll just
47:02 - tell you basically my skype is just
47:06 - Jessie dot Weigel and I'm available
47:09 - today after four and then tomorrow after
47:12 - four but also tomorrow I could probably
47:15 - Skype between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and
47:23 - that's all Eastern Time
47:31 - okay
47:48 - okay I think that's everything that I
47:51 - need to catch up with ya yes
47:55 - Quincy 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time today yeah
48:01 - sorry about the email I mean I'm I'm my
48:04 - almost positive that I said I definitely
48:06 - typed it out and maybe I didn't stick
48:10 - around long enough to see if it actually
48:11 - sent but yeah just let me know okay I
48:18 - have a short meeting at 3:30 p.m. today
48:20 - so I think it should be over by 4:00
48:23 - Eastern but it shouldn't run much longer
48:29 - than that but anyway yeah just let me
48:33 - know whatever time is good for you will
48:36 - probably work for me as long as I don't
48:38 - have a meeting or anything okay let's
48:43 - see okay this is the best thing so so we
48:55 - solved one problem that caused another
48:57 - basically which is okay I knew that that
49:00 - was going to happen when I was changing
49:03 - things in there so let's see
49:08 - before I go about changing this I want
49:11 - to try to put in an icon just to be sure
49:15 - that I can actually put an icon and it
49:17 - then it works I don't see why it
49:19 - wouldn't work but let's let's test it no
49:25 - sense trying to rewrite a bunch of what
49:27 - we're doing elsewhere in that component
49:30 - if this isn't gonna work for sure so
49:38 - yeah so we'll definitely need we need to
49:43 - make sure I'm gonna try to use an SVG
49:44 - icon hopefully that works we're gonna
49:47 - have to make sure that we change the way
49:51 - that this does click worst is right now
49:53 - you can click anywhere on here and it
49:56 - will check or uncheck the boxes so we're
49:58 - gonna have to do something similar to
49:59 - what we did down here except what I'd
50:04 - like to do is have the word photography
50:07 - still be clickable for the check but
50:10 - then only the icon be what what brings
50:13 - up the modal so if we can do that then
50:19 - we will otherwise it'll be okay if users
50:23 - have to just check on the box I would
50:27 - imagine that most people's first
50:28 - instinct is to check directly on the box
50:30 - anyway I just glanced over and I saw we
50:41 - have a question it says what are we
50:43 - doing now what is this project basically
50:46 - I am right now we're gonna add an icon
50:50 - here on this checkbox and when you click
50:52 - it it's going to open up a modal overall
50:55 - the main point of the project is to have
50:57 - a forum where people can put in requests
51:01 - for work and then that form data gets
51:03 - sent to our project management system
51:05 - and then it also sends out several
51:07 - emails to people one of them being the
51:10 - user that inputs this data alright so
51:16 - let's go back and well first let's grab
51:19 - an SVG icon so let's check out the
51:21 - material
51:27 - there we go
51:30 - here I come
51:36 - all right cool so we have info I think I
51:39 - like this one
51:43 - and so outline SVG
51:54 - and
52:00 - we can just grab the code and I'm just
52:09 - gonna put this right in here and see
52:11 - what happens
52:25 - see that works
52:30 - Oh not bad it worked great okay cool so
52:33 - we have an icon that's awesome
52:36 - definitely needs some some positioning
52:40 - work here but I'm not worried about that
52:42 - yet awesome okay so we have our icon
52:48 - let's see how did I do this before let's
52:57 - see what I did down here
53:26 - hmm maybe
53:53 - okay alright so here's how here's how I
53:56 - did this and here's how the check boxes
53:58 - work and they have to come up with a
54:01 - different way to do this then so the
54:07 - input this would be easier to show it on
54:10 - dev tools basically normally the input
54:15 - is a lot wider right so it kind of goes
54:18 - over so what I did was I made the input
54:22 - width be a lot shorter so that's all I
54:27 - needed to do to make sure that we could
54:29 - click this and it would be a link
54:31 - instead of just making the check box be
54:35 - filled in so up here it's not gonna be
54:42 - quite as easy to do
54:49 - I mean right now we could I don't really
54:52 - want to do it this way but this way will
54:54 - work if we took these check boxes here
55:00 - and instead of just having it be an
55:02 - array it could be an array of objects
55:05 - right and then we could have the check
55:07 - box name or you know the label and then
55:11 - also the value that we would put as the
55:14 - style and then we have to change
55:17 - everything we're doing well we're
55:20 - actually we're already gonna have to
55:22 - change the way we do this anyway so it
55:24 - might not be that bad if we're gonna do
55:27 - if we're gonna add this SVG in here we
55:31 - can't keep it we can't keep this we're
55:34 - gonna have to do something else
55:35 - so that's a possibility the other
55:39 - possibility would be let me try this out
55:43 - so I haven't done this in a while but I
55:51 - remember doing something like this
55:53 - before that worked so we would go
56:03 - no this won't work basically what I was
56:08 - gonna do was go pointer events none and
56:11 - then on the icon say pointer events all
56:15 - oh sorry is yawning but that's not going
56:25 - to work because then you couldn't
56:26 - actually click the checkbox
56:33 - hmm so I think the best bet is to make
56:38 - this this checkbox just a lot a lot more
56:46 - narrow yeah
56:58 - all right I'm gonna go to the live show
56:59 - if anybody has any suggestions other
57:05 - than what I had just said that we could
57:08 - possibly do let me know I'll just take a
57:10 - minute to see what's in a live chat
57:12 - before I try to implement any of this
57:15 - because it's possible there's some
57:21 - better solution that I'm overlooking
57:25 - let's see
57:48 - okay
58:02 - okay John Hanson said I must prefer the
58:05 - icon that is like an eye with an arrow
58:07 - inside the box more - more intuitive - a
58:10 - visitor as it says this will open
58:12 - something up
58:14 - I guess I'm open to different icons I'd
58:21 - like to stick with ones that are like
58:23 - material design that are normally used
58:29 - with material design also ones that are
58:31 - SVG so within that kind of with within
58:37 - those constraints I'm open to having
58:41 - different things
58:47 - okay
58:52 - man I don't think I'm gonna have time
58:55 - since our second point Midori session is
58:57 - almost over if anyone does have any
59:00 - ideas about this at any point during the
59:02 - question answer session that we're about
59:04 - to have or later on or anything please
59:06 - let me know because I'm just really like
59:09 - I would hate to just change so much of
59:16 - what's going on here just for one of
59:18 - these checkboxes hum I mean maybe it's
59:24 - possible that we would do similar things
59:25 - with other checkboxes in the future but
59:27 - right now there's there's no plans for
59:29 - that maybe once people see this
59:33 - then they'll request to have it on other
59:36 - things I mean it could potentially be
59:42 - useful there's just so much it's there's
59:49 - so much potential for messing more
59:51 - things up when I'm gonna cut and change
59:54 - a lot of this but yeah I guess it it has
60:05 - to happen that's I'm just not seeing
60:09 - another better way right now okay so
60:15 - that's the second Pomodoro session up I
60:21 - guess we we kind of got some stuff done
60:24 - not to the point where it it's it's
60:27 - ready
60:28 - obviously right we can't can't have that
60:31 - but I think we're on the right track I
60:34 - mean I know what I know it could be done
60:37 - to to get it to work
60:39 - so that's better than mean out of ideas
60:44 - I suppose so I'm gonna go to the live
60:47 - chat now if you have any questions
60:50 - please put it in the chat I'll do my
60:52 - best to answer it if if you can't stick
60:57 - around and answer the question then you
61:00 - can just direct message me
61:03 - or watch the recording of this later on
61:05 - if you were just here for the code and
61:08 - you got a stop watching now that's cool
61:11 - too thanks for watching I'll be back
61:13 - again tomorrow I'm thinking tomorrow's
61:16 - show probably be a little earlier maybe
61:19 - like 1:00 p.m. Eastern 1:30 all you know
61:25 - Oh course schedule it is early as I can
61:26 - tomorrow and I'll put a message on
61:30 - Twitter as well okay so I'm gonna go
61:37 - through here looks like there's not a
61:42 - whole lot in there so so if you are
61:45 - going to answer your question I would do
61:46 - it quick because I'm going to get
61:48 - through these in a few minutes it looks
61:49 - like
62:07 - let's see I I'm on Mustafa hopefully I
62:13 - pronounced that right sorry if I didn't
62:14 - says you have followers from Egypt
62:16 - awesome thanks for watching
62:26 - Emmanuel says and follower from Haiti -
62:30 - awesome thank you so much for watching
62:37 - I'm on also said I'm front-end should I
62:41 - continue watching yeah I'm I'm mostly we
62:44 - mostly do front-end stuff so we have I
62:50 - suppose been doing some stuff that would
62:54 - be more back in the last couple of
62:56 - streams but mostly we do front-end stuff
63:00 - so this is definitely the right place
63:01 - for you
63:22 - oh okay you know what John just
63:25 - mentioned something that I think this is
63:30 - going to be a lot easier than I'm making
63:31 - it out to be I think I was I was just
63:38 - overthinking this too much so John says
63:41 - can't the checkbox on that info icon
63:43 - change the state of the modal and you're
63:47 - entirely right it could definitely do
63:49 - that so for whatever reason I was
63:52 - thinking I wanted these to be
63:53 - independent but I think when I initially
63:55 - explained this I had explained that if
64:00 - you check that a modal would come up so
64:04 - what will happen like let's say that I
64:08 - don't go through everything to make this
64:10 - independently clickable from this what
64:12 - will happen is if you click that I it'll
64:15 - actually check this now potentially that
64:17 - could be slightly annoying to user if
64:19 - they just were curious about what this
64:21 - was and didn't intend to check the box
64:23 - but they could always uncheck it you
64:27 - know it's not I guess it's not like a
64:32 - huge inconvenience I could see that it
64:34 - would be slightly unexpected but yeah we
64:42 - could just have it so that a click on
64:43 - here not only activates that checkbox
64:48 - but it also makes the modal pop-up in
64:51 - fact there may be some sort of callback
64:59 - where we could we could make that happen
65:03 - already but that kind of gives us the
65:07 - same problem of how do we put that
65:09 - callback just on this one and not on the
65:11 - other ones without changing this into
65:13 - some sort of array of objects for a
65:19 - second I thought this would be a lot
65:22 - easier but I guess it it won't be I
65:25 - I guess the as it's set up currently
65:28 - there's really no way around adding some
65:30 - extra extra properties here
65:44 - okay yeah so it may end up if I'm gonna
65:49 - have to add add things to that array
65:53 - either way I probably just should make
65:57 - it happen whenever this is clicked and
65:59 - making independent of the checkbox
66:13 - Anheuser hey awesome
66:16 - haven't haven't seen you in the live
66:19 - chat for a while but said had the most
66:22 - unproductive day today I'm sorry to hear
66:25 - that sometimes that happens if you want
66:30 - to want to give any details if you need
66:34 - to talk about it that's cool
66:36 - either in the live chat or you can
66:38 - message me on Twitter if you want I
66:40 - definitely definitely it happens so
66:52 - don't get too down about it because
66:56 - there there are some days when you're
66:57 - super productive and some days when
66:59 - you're not so productive but I'm sure
67:02 - there's always something good to be said
67:04 - for for any day
67:15 - oh okay John Hanson says you can do
67:18 - callback on key value yeah that's true
67:34 - ACEF Lee true I'm gonna have to just
67:36 - think about this more I I like I'd like
67:40 - to take some time to just look at that
67:42 - component as it is now and what all is
67:44 - going on and rethink what what would be
67:49 - the best way to organize this given what
67:53 - we want to do now because when we first
67:54 - made that we didn't have this in mind at
67:58 - all so it's possible that it should
68:01 - undergo a big change because the
68:06 - requirements are different now and that
68:10 - might be better to try to do a big
68:12 - change and have it make more sense you
68:16 - know from here on out in view of what we
68:20 - may want to do not only with this
68:22 - checkbox but with other checkboxes so
68:27 - you're off to look at that I just I
68:28 - haven't worked on this for well
68:31 - basically since we first made it so I
68:34 - need to like kind of reef Amil your eyes
68:36 - myself with it and we have had some pool
68:37 - requests with that as well so it looks
68:40 - different than when when I was doing
68:42 - things with it so yeah maybe I should
68:46 - before I change any more and try to make
68:50 - a big decision about it then I just need
68:58 - to get to know what's going on
69:04 - witch hunt says this is what can make
69:07 - reactive at mind-boggling him yeah yeah
69:10 - it can sometimes I saw I forget where I
69:14 - saw it I probably either on Twitter
69:16 - Instagram but somebody was saying react
69:19 - makes simple things easy or complicated
69:23 - things easy and easy things complicated
69:27 - or something like that and I could see
69:32 - yet like some things are really easy
69:34 - with react and some things are like if I
69:37 - was just using jQuery this would be so
69:39 - easy but all in all I really do like
69:45 - react I think it's worth it's worth the
69:48 - occasional headaches to try to do a
69:50 - thing that would otherwise be pretty
69:55 - easy and in this case I don't
69:58 - necessarily think it's Reax fault I
70:00 - think it's just we had initially
70:02 - organized this without thinking about
70:05 - doing anything like this so you know
70:09 - obviously it's it's not gonna work with
70:11 - with it as is Sebastian says well I keep
70:17 - updating my pull requests with small
70:19 - changes not really following this dream
70:21 - that's cool Sebastian I I'm not gonna
70:24 - complain about that I definitely
70:26 - appreciate the the pull requests and all
70:29 - the changes so I mean I like having you
70:33 - in the live chat as well but that's
70:36 - definitely a great reason sonography
70:39 - paying attention all right well I think
70:44 - I've got through everything in the live
70:45 - chat and I have all about about ten
70:52 - minutes before I need to leave my office
70:54 - and start walking over to the other
70:58 - building where the meetings can be at so
71:02 - thank you so much everyone for for
71:06 - watching for joining in the live chat I
71:08 - appreciate all the all the advice and
71:11 - the suggestions that you have and all
71:14 - the encouragement
71:16 - I I'll be back tomorrow like I said
71:20 - earlier it'll probably end up being a
71:22 - little bit earlier than normal so maybe
71:24 - like 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time yeah and oh
71:32 - you know special thanks again to
71:35 - everyone who who submits pull requests
71:38 - and things as well that's that's just
71:40 - super helpful and has helped me get a
71:43 - lot better by reviewing you know all
71:45 - this pull requests and seeing how you do
71:47 - everything
71:50 - all right yeah so I'll be back tomorrow
71:54 - and until then have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jessie and today I'm going to show you what I've done with the our server das file with trying to check to make sure our files are legit before we upload them and we had a pool request so Sebastian has done some work on client side validation I'd like to go over that I'm gonna try to get in to Pomodoro cycles worth of coding today I have a meeting in an hour and a half so won't be super long stream today but I think if we get into 25minute Pomodoro sessions and leave the rest of the time for questions that that should definitely be enough to get in all the questions unless we have a lot more questions than normal so I'm gonna get right into it if I notice that there's a lot of new people in the live chat I might give my normal explanation of what this is and what's going on but otherwise to save time I'm just going to get right into it also have the Instagram live stream going as well so if anybody's interested in that not not really anything exciting you just get to see my face in the view of my office as if you were the monitor okay so I just committed my latest work and I'm gonna push it to the repo now okay so that is now on the file type check branch on the github repo the link is in the description so if you want to check this out on you know in the browser or cloning the repo and and try it out for yourself you can do that so basically here's here's what I've done and some of it might not be absolutely necessary but I figured you know what it's not like these checks are super resource intensive so if I leave something in that may not be absolutely necessary I'm not that worried about it maybe there is you know some some good reason to have it in there that I just can't think about in terms of a possible malicious file upload so I'll just go through some of the things you've already seen at the end of yesterday's stream I realized that I had made a mistake and I was checking for basically I was getting the file type the mi any type but I was checking it against a red jack a regular expression that had file extensions instead so obviously like that what it was working for pings but it didn't work for pretty much everything else and so that's why I hadn't noticed it until the end so now I have the correct checks but I've actually I've kept both so I'm I'm getting the file extension from the file name and I'm checking that and I'm also getting the file type and I'm checking it against the M IME types so you could see these are these reflect you know the types down here so a little bit a little bit longer okay but it's checking for the same thing and I grabbed this from what Sebastian was doing on the client side and thank you for that Sebastian because I was I was just getting ready to get these and compiled something like this on my and then I saw your pool requests and check that out and this just saved me a bunch of time and trying to do this so that was awesome I appreciate that so I'm doing those two checks and you can see right now I just have this if statement that just has a bunch of checks probably depending on what's going on and how much time I have this could definitely use some refactoring and cleaning up in fact this entire server das file is just getting really long so it could it could use some work I mean it's functional but it's not pretty right now but I'm not gonna bother cleaning it up until we get it to the point where it's working like we want it to work and then we can clean it up if anybody really likes to do the cleanup type of stuff I appreciate and welcome any any pool requests let me go with you other checks okay so I'm checking I read up on node security so let me show you what I found so I found this article and I linked to this here so you can check that out if you look on the repo so this kind of goes through some of the things that you can do to help protect against attacks from from file uploads and so I implemented some of this one thing that it was saying is you don't want to allow dots and slashes in your file names so I'm checking obviously we're gonna have one dot for the file extension right so I'm okay with one dot but anything more than one dot I'm gonna reject so this has dots here that's what it's checking for so if has dots is true meaning it has more than one dot then we reject the file similar thing with slashes but I don't want any slashes so if it has a slash then this will be true and we'll reject it the other thing that I had never heard of but I read about was this poison no bites so I'm not a hundred percent sure that I understand how to do this right like if I was in the place of the attacker I don't know how I would do this but basically it's a way to oops I need me to click on that basically it's a way to show one file name but that's not really the real file name so you could have a file name that passes all the other tests but then really the file name could be something that has like something more like this down here that has your dots and slashes that would allow the user to access directories that they shouldn't access ok so like so I guess I understand what could happen not really sure how is it to how to do that but I've added a check for this and so basically I just took this and now I'm checking here for the it's a poison and all bytes check so if this check if this is true that means it's bad and so we reject it so those are the that's everything that I've added so far I I think I think I'm probably gonna move on at this point and do some more with other parts of the site I need to get this ready to show people in my department and get feedback because there's Pro there are probably going to be some changes out of meeting this morning department meaning and went over some things the Trello board which i think is linked in the description has some new items on there for changes to content and additions to content so I'd like to get some things working and make sure that everything at least visibly is ready for people to give me feedback on so probably won't work on this again until a little bit later on but for now we do have some decent checks and protections not perfect but it's still not you know it's much better than what we had just a few days ago all right so now I'm gonna go to the client side and I just realized that I forgot to set my Pomodoro timer so I'm about ten minutes in yeah I guess I'll just set it and I also set it for the full 25 and if we get down to it and there's a few minutes left I may just stop it a bit early so let me let me just show you I'm gonna have to switch let's see let me check the live chat I just realized that I hadn't even looked at it at all yet so hey everyone Oh Oscar says hello from Venezuela hey welcome he says these videos have been a great help to me thank you so much hey you're welcome I'm really glad that they're helpful to you that when I hear stuff like that it makes me want to keep going keep doing doing these videos so that's awesome okay Sebastian said okay here's some good stuff let me explain this so Sebastian had a question here and I want to explain this I forgot I forgot that I did this so Sebastian's version of this was a little bit bigger so it had things like application so all of them had this kind of first part here and Sebastian was asking does it work without that and it does if you do so what I'm doing up here from my file type is I'm only getting what's after that slash right so that's why I was able to leave off all the other things so if you look at what Sebastian did on the pool request I think it's pool requests 56 yeah I think 56 and I think it's Sebastian actually a tool to pull request 55 did get merged into master and that fixed an error that was happening in the console that had to do with IDs on input fields so thank you for that Sebastian but anyway that's why it works because I'm not getting the entire file type I'm splitting that and just getting that last part so either way would work it just depends on what your you're checking it against so in this case I'm checking it against the file type which is just really just the last part of the file type so hopefully that makes sense okay cool Sebastian says I got it yeah so sorry about that I had four didn't I didn't even remember that I did that so yeah but like I said the other way to work okay Sebastian also said he doesn't think that he got all of them skipped a few okay cool I'll just have to go through actually I found a site that has it it seems like it says that it has all the different M IME types so I'll go through and check it out it looks like you you definitely got most of them but I'll double check and go through go through that site okay so patrick has a few a few tips for me here actually Sebastian poison the lights listen to my shake Patrick when you said when you're talking about the poison no bites check I'm not sure what your your meaning there when you have it twice with like the little arrow in between it so I'm sorry I'm just not understanding so you get explain that a little bit more I would appreciate it okay Patrick also says Patrick says also I have multiple dots and found in it's pretty often which you should be concerned with this double dots that's a really good point oh did I just misspell poison is that the problem okay I see it I see now that it was spelled differently let me see P man thanks for okay thank you that's funny yesterday I came home and my wife said she was working on a free code camp problem the one about converting Celsius to Fahrenheit and it's one of the early JavaScript dog algorithms and she said she'd been working on it for a long time I think she said like 45 minutes she couldn't get it to work so she wanted me to look at it so I looked at it for a little while and and probably just a few minutes and I went through everything and it was like yeah you know this this should work what's what's going on and she had just spelled Celsius wrong so that was that was the problem she has about two different ways so it kept saying it was undefined inside the function she was trying to pass in Celsius as a parameter right and so anyway that was the whole problem so and I told her don't worry about it that happens to me all the time in front of everybody on YouTube so don't be don't be embarrassed and here it just happened less than 24 hours after that so anyway I always appreciate that when when you all catch that so I mean in this case it wouldn't everything still would have one run properly because I had misspelled it consistently but it's still good haven't spelled right all right sorry about it I just kept a bunch of messages this came up in my slack for my department I just wanted to skim through quickly and see if there was some sort of emergency it looks like okay it looks like it's fine so alright so I think we got we've got the spelling sorted out I'll Det I'll go back and doublecheck and make sure we're covering all the types that we want to cover here and now let me show you what's going on with the clientside validation so I'll bring this over so you can see I'm gonna check out a different branch so let's do check out and I named this oops hold on a second I have to get a knock at the door okay I'm back let's see okay so I need to check out to a different branch and I can't remember what the name of that was there we go okay so now we're on this branch and I can bring over okay so looks like it's working let me bring this over all right so I'll show you what it's doing first like what a user would see and then we can check out the code you can see the code I think I mentioned earlier it's pool request 56 will show the the new code that's been put in by Sebastian so you can see now like if I try to put in numbers for my name it'll say it's not a valid name same thing email right so we have immediate feedback which is pretty awesome and also if we try to submit without the required fields it says right please fill out this field so really useful it's it's nice to have we also are checking types for the upload so if I try to upload something that's not supported it won't work so let me see I'm assuming this isn't supported let's see if this works actually that's not working right now I didn't test this out earlier so but I know this is it's in there somewhere so I guess I could try this I could try to submit it but it's probably not gonna work because we're on I wonder what it happened okay so I don't know how many of these Sebastian made required but we need to go through I still need to get confirmation from people in my department as to what fields really need to be required my preference is to make as few fields required as possible so that it's easier for the user but I understand that there are some things that are really important to know ahead of time so we'll see so I can't exactly complete this yet and so I have that information I can I I have most of the information to complete these check boxes so that will be happening soon and yeah I can definitely at least get everything I know for sure will be in here and then I'll get some feedback on that but that's basically it I mean it it may not look like a lot right here but I'm sure as you know if you've done something like this it's not it's not just simple to do that there's a lot that goes into it so let me show you just a little bit about how this was done so if we check out our package.json you'll see we have formzee react in form z material UI so this is really nice and helpful there's already a library that does validation and it integrates with material UI so that takes care of so much for us that was a really good job finding that sebastian i i've a glee remember looking into form z maybe months ago for something and i completely forgotten about it so i would have tried to have done this completely on my own had you know i found that and that would have taken much longer so on the service request form we're importing things from form z and then using them so our entire form then is rat this is getting to be a big component huh our entire forum then is wrapped in this form z form component so a little bit of a change in the way this this looks but in terms of you know on this end of things but pretty much everything inside so I get about the same right we have some some change right so form Z check box right so we do have some things that are at least for the words you know the names of the components are slightly different but not too not too bad in terms of trying to implement this so this is not it I'm just going over it this is not everything that Sebastian did so I'm going over this quickly so we can move on to some other stuff but you can see forms use a really good way to do this and it's not like you don't have to know a lot about form validation yourself to implement some of this which is really cool okay all right so let's check out what we can do now on the Trello board so like I said I'm going to kind of move this back a bit and go go back to it just so at this point I really do need some feedback I think I could be moving faster if I knew exactly what was wanted um I'm kind of finding more things to do or thank you trying to think of more things to do until I get the info I need and I haven't been super proactive and trying to seek out the information you know it's I much prefer to just be sitting in my office coding I've been trying to track down people and email and get the information I need so it's it's is partially my fault that I haven't been been more aggressive at that actually this will be this might be fun to do so I haven't done this before so here's what I want to do so let me show you where's our check boxes I don't know if I should do it on this branch or not probably not let's uh let's go to another branch this is going to be minor enough I could think I could just do it on master it should be fine but let me just change one of these checkboxes I want to change that to photography great so here's what I want to happen we have some additional information that needs to be displayed if someone selects photography so what I would like to happen is when they select photography have a modal come up or basically if something needs to come up and I'm not I'm not entirely sure what the best thing would be right now my initial thought was a modal and then I thought oh well you know if that modal pops up every time it's going to get annoying for people who have read it multiple times so then I thought perhaps a tooltip right so that when you put your cursor over top of it then it comes up that that could work too it's not it's it's probably a bit too much information for a tooltip though let me show you what the info will be just to give you an idea so it's gonna be this whole list I think I'm originally I was supposed to put the dates in here but I'm gonna now they want me to leave out the dates so this is going to be this big list of events and then also some explanatory text so I don't know I think that's way too much for a tooltip I think it would be better in a modal scrollable especially like on mobile it's entirely possible that this list could be bigger than the viewport so I guess I'm thinking more of a modal so that's what I need so basically when this is checked the modal needs to pop up and then the modal can be dismissed but the check would still be there so it's not going to be tied you know completely into the check in terms of you know you can uncheck certainly if you if you check the modal needs to pop up but when the modal is dismissed I want the check to stay there right Patrick's idea is how about an info icon that pops the modal independent of the checkbox the checkbox label I did think of an info icon I'm okay with an info icon I was kind of anticipating that other people in my department would not be okay with that but it might be worth it just to put it in anyway and see if I can find it by with that I think it's better and less intrusive with the info icon but from past experience with with my department there they want to make sure that people see things right so you know they want there to be no question that you know no one could come and say well I didn't know you know they want to be able to say well you had to have seen it because you couldn't have gone any further without seeing it right so if I can get it through with the icon then that's that's fine so let's do that let's put add an icon and let's make it so that if you click that icon then the modal comes up it'll be independent of the checkbox yeah I think that'll be the best the best way to do it I also think it might not be a bad idea if we have time to add in in the email so if photography is checked the email that gets sent to the user confirming their submission will also have that in about photography and that way I think we may get it may be okay to just have that that icon there because they'll beginning in a second time directly to their email yeah so I think that sounds sounds like it'll work let me check my timer before we start on this okay let me take my break now because if you remember I started my time or nine minutes late so let's let's take the five minute break now I'm gonna go to the Live Chat check everything probably won't need the whole five minutes for the live chat because there's not very many questions but then we'll come back and we'll we'll put this modal in so we do have some modal's but I don't think that I've done any modal's on on the stream I think they're all from a pull request so this will be cool we'll see how to do modal's in material UI I don't know probably not going to get to the email thing like that'll be on the list of things that if we have time we'll get to but it's not really necessary okay so let me go if you're not familiar with how the stream works I take five minute breaks between 25 minute coding sessions to go to a live chat and answer any questions that you might have after the five minute break we'll go back and do another session for today's stream I'm just going to do two sessions totals have one more session after this then we'll finish up with a questionandanswer session that is normally as long as it takes to get to all the questions today I do have a hard break though because I have a meeting at 330 Eastern Time which is in about an hour all right so let me let me scroll up okay Sebastian wanted me to share a link to the security article all right I will put that in the live chat now and it's also a comment in the server JS file on the the file file type check branch is that what I called it I think so yeah Jordan says what up programming peeves hey how's it going thanks for joining us how cool sebastian said the first to do is almost implemented yeah for sure where did I put that yeah anyway Sebastian I was like really happy when I saw your pool request because I was thinking like this is going to take a long time for me to implement wait a second it says sebastian says he can't find the pool request his pool requests on github let me double check which pool requests are you talking about the one with the clientside validation or the one before that so i guess would be 55 or 56 oh you know what that s client validation branch i did not push that up yet so it's only exist locally for me it's just a copy of of your pool request and actually i think it was before the last commit so it's not even up to date so i'll need to pull it down again to get the latest jonathan says I've just started the responsive design with bootstrap section on free code camp I have no clue what's going on here but I like that this is happening all right cool I'm glad you like it and feel free to ask any questions I'm happy to answer questions don't worry about if you think the question is you know too simple or something it's no questions bother me so feel free to ask there's a lot of really knowledgeable people people that know more than I do in the live chat that can help answer things as well sometimes it takes me a little while to get to the questions but I do try to answer everything for the stream is over and I'll try to explain things as best I can as I go along okay all right I think I got that through everything so okay not bad I didn't think you'd take the full five minutes but I got close so I'm gonna go ahead and start this timer and let's do another 25 minute session of coding when I do these sessions it's not that I ignore the live chat sometimes I check back especially if I get stuck and need to ask for some help but I just usually don't answer questions during that that period okay so the plan is make an icon when you click the icon then the modal comes up Sebastian I think had mentioned maybe hovering over the icon and have the tooltip up here I thought about that too but like I said before I think it's too much information for just a tooltip I think a tooltip would have been ideal if it wasn't for that giant list of things that needs to that needs to go in there so yes I think we're gonna go with the modal hmm let's see how we can put this in so right now we just have these strings going in I don't know if I can put in an icon but let's let's see if I can put in HTML and see what it does I'll just try this out first okay can't like that see how this is getting put in there all right so this left check boxes I wonder all right let's try to do it like this then instead of making it a string let's put this whole thing in the span let's see what we get in the whoops and I'm not working there okay all right so down here down here we're doing some things with that label and so that's not allowing us to put in what we need okay let's see okay so we need to find a way to pass and let's say you think of some way around it we need to be able to pass HTML instead of a string which we may be able to do but right now we are since we're doing this okay yeah we using this a lot all right well let's take this off of the checkbox you all right so just for this checkbox field just to test it I'm going to stop this format label to property and let's see let's just put all right hopefully it'll let me do this just so I can test this out obviously I don't want to keep it like this but this should still work for everything else I just needed to work for the checkboxes all right let's see hmm looks like it's not gonna work all right I'm not still calling this somewhere shouldn't be calling this anywhere else let's doublecheck all right so let's check it out that string probs okay so that shouldn't be doing it okay versus checkbox pros okay we don't adhere to all right where are we using checkbox probes yes alright I'm gonna I'm really gonna mess this up so I just want to test if this is even possible before I make really big changes alright let's see yes all right awesome so it does work right so I didn't do a great job explaining that so let me let me kind of sum up what I did the whole point of what I was trying to do is that I wanted to see if I could pass in HTML and have it render so I did so I did here so you can see there are spans here but they don't show up so that's what we want so that works now in the process of being able to do that I had this disabled a lot of other stuff that was going on so I may have made this form at least the checkbox portion of it useless and you can see since I've just given all the checkboxes the same name then the checks just keep the point like this hold on one second everyone I gotta take this hello hey how's it going you alright I'm back sorry about that today's been crazy for interruptions but that was I got a request to do some work on a site that's not really one that I maintain but we don't the position that's supposed to maintain that is is open right now we don't have anybody in there so I guess I'm gonna do it and I also got invited to a Labor Day picnic so that's cool uhhuh so let me see okay so I'm gonna catch up just quickly on the live chat because it looks like so Quincy's in the chat hey Quincy if you're still in there listening in the chat I did I emailed you back right before I started the stream so if you didn't get it I'll just tell you basically my skype is just Jessie dot Weigel and I'm available today after four and then tomorrow after four but also tomorrow I could probably Skype between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and that's all Eastern Time okay okay I think that's everything that I need to catch up with ya yes Quincy 400 p.m. Eastern Time today yeah sorry about the email I mean I'm I'm my almost positive that I said I definitely typed it out and maybe I didn't stick around long enough to see if it actually sent but yeah just let me know okay I have a short meeting at 330 p.m. today so I think it should be over by 400 Eastern but it shouldn't run much longer than that but anyway yeah just let me know whatever time is good for you will probably work for me as long as I don't have a meeting or anything okay let's see okay this is the best thing so so we solved one problem that caused another basically which is okay I knew that that was going to happen when I was changing things in there so let's see before I go about changing this I want to try to put in an icon just to be sure that I can actually put an icon and it then it works I don't see why it wouldn't work but let's let's test it no sense trying to rewrite a bunch of what we're doing elsewhere in that component if this isn't gonna work for sure so yeah so we'll definitely need we need to make sure I'm gonna try to use an SVG icon hopefully that works we're gonna have to make sure that we change the way that this does click worst is right now you can click anywhere on here and it will check or uncheck the boxes so we're gonna have to do something similar to what we did down here except what I'd like to do is have the word photography still be clickable for the check but then only the icon be what what brings up the modal so if we can do that then we will otherwise it'll be okay if users have to just check on the box I would imagine that most people's first instinct is to check directly on the box anyway I just glanced over and I saw we have a question it says what are we doing now what is this project basically I am right now we're gonna add an icon here on this checkbox and when you click it it's going to open up a modal overall the main point of the project is to have a forum where people can put in requests for work and then that form data gets sent to our project management system and then it also sends out several emails to people one of them being the user that inputs this data alright so let's go back and well first let's grab an SVG icon so let's check out the material there we go here I come all right cool so we have info I think I like this one and so outline SVG and we can just grab the code and I'm just gonna put this right in here and see what happens see that works Oh not bad it worked great okay cool so we have an icon that's awesome definitely needs some some positioning work here but I'm not worried about that yet awesome okay so we have our icon let's see how did I do this before let's see what I did down here hmm maybe okay alright so here's how here's how I did this and here's how the check boxes work and they have to come up with a different way to do this then so the input this would be easier to show it on dev tools basically normally the input is a lot wider right so it kind of goes over so what I did was I made the input width be a lot shorter so that's all I needed to do to make sure that we could click this and it would be a link instead of just making the check box be filled in so up here it's not gonna be quite as easy to do I mean right now we could I don't really want to do it this way but this way will work if we took these check boxes here and instead of just having it be an array it could be an array of objects right and then we could have the check box name or you know the label and then also the value that we would put as the style and then we have to change everything we're doing well we're actually we're already gonna have to change the way we do this anyway so it might not be that bad if we're gonna do if we're gonna add this SVG in here we can't keep it we can't keep this we're gonna have to do something else so that's a possibility the other possibility would be let me try this out so I haven't done this in a while but I remember doing something like this before that worked so we would go no this won't work basically what I was gonna do was go pointer events none and then on the icon say pointer events all oh sorry is yawning but that's not going to work because then you couldn't actually click the checkbox hmm so I think the best bet is to make this this checkbox just a lot a lot more narrow yeah all right I'm gonna go to the live show if anybody has any suggestions other than what I had just said that we could possibly do let me know I'll just take a minute to see what's in a live chat before I try to implement any of this because it's possible there's some better solution that I'm overlooking let's see okay okay John Hanson said I must prefer the icon that is like an eye with an arrow inside the box more more intuitive a visitor as it says this will open something up I guess I'm open to different icons I'd like to stick with ones that are like material design that are normally used with material design also ones that are SVG so within that kind of with within those constraints I'm open to having different things okay man I don't think I'm gonna have time since our second point Midori session is almost over if anyone does have any ideas about this at any point during the question answer session that we're about to have or later on or anything please let me know because I'm just really like I would hate to just change so much of what's going on here just for one of these checkboxes hum I mean maybe it's possible that we would do similar things with other checkboxes in the future but right now there's there's no plans for that maybe once people see this then they'll request to have it on other things I mean it could potentially be useful there's just so much it's there's so much potential for messing more things up when I'm gonna cut and change a lot of this but yeah I guess it it has to happen that's I'm just not seeing another better way right now okay so that's the second Pomodoro session up I guess we we kind of got some stuff done not to the point where it it's it's ready obviously right we can't can't have that but I think we're on the right track I mean I know what I know it could be done to to get it to work so that's better than mean out of ideas I suppose so I'm gonna go to the live chat now if you have any questions please put it in the chat I'll do my best to answer it if if you can't stick around and answer the question then you can just direct message me or watch the recording of this later on if you were just here for the code and you got a stop watching now that's cool too thanks for watching I'll be back again tomorrow I'm thinking tomorrow's show probably be a little earlier maybe like 100 p.m. Eastern 130 all you know Oh course schedule it is early as I can tomorrow and I'll put a message on Twitter as well okay so I'm gonna go through here looks like there's not a whole lot in there so so if you are going to answer your question I would do it quick because I'm going to get through these in a few minutes it looks like let's see I I'm on Mustafa hopefully I pronounced that right sorry if I didn't says you have followers from Egypt awesome thanks for watching Emmanuel says and follower from Haiti awesome thank you so much for watching I'm on also said I'm frontend should I continue watching yeah I'm I'm mostly we mostly do frontend stuff so we have I suppose been doing some stuff that would be more back in the last couple of streams but mostly we do frontend stuff so this is definitely the right place for you oh okay you know what John just mentioned something that I think this is going to be a lot easier than I'm making it out to be I think I was I was just overthinking this too much so John says can't the checkbox on that info icon change the state of the modal and you're entirely right it could definitely do that so for whatever reason I was thinking I wanted these to be independent but I think when I initially explained this I had explained that if you check that a modal would come up so what will happen like let's say that I don't go through everything to make this independently clickable from this what will happen is if you click that I it'll actually check this now potentially that could be slightly annoying to user if they just were curious about what this was and didn't intend to check the box but they could always uncheck it you know it's not I guess it's not like a huge inconvenience I could see that it would be slightly unexpected but yeah we could just have it so that a click on here not only activates that checkbox but it also makes the modal popup in fact there may be some sort of callback where we could we could make that happen already but that kind of gives us the same problem of how do we put that callback just on this one and not on the other ones without changing this into some sort of array of objects for a second I thought this would be a lot easier but I guess it it won't be I I guess the as it's set up currently there's really no way around adding some extra extra properties here okay yeah so it may end up if I'm gonna have to add add things to that array either way I probably just should make it happen whenever this is clicked and making independent of the checkbox Anheuser hey awesome haven't haven't seen you in the live chat for a while but said had the most unproductive day today I'm sorry to hear that sometimes that happens if you want to want to give any details if you need to talk about it that's cool either in the live chat or you can message me on Twitter if you want I definitely definitely it happens so don't get too down about it because there there are some days when you're super productive and some days when you're not so productive but I'm sure there's always something good to be said for for any day oh okay John Hanson says you can do callback on key value yeah that's true ACEF Lee true I'm gonna have to just think about this more I I like I'd like to take some time to just look at that component as it is now and what all is going on and rethink what what would be the best way to organize this given what we want to do now because when we first made that we didn't have this in mind at all so it's possible that it should undergo a big change because the requirements are different now and that might be better to try to do a big change and have it make more sense you know from here on out in view of what we may want to do not only with this checkbox but with other checkboxes so you're off to look at that I just I haven't worked on this for well basically since we first made it so I need to like kind of reef Amil your eyes myself with it and we have had some pool requests with that as well so it looks different than when when I was doing things with it so yeah maybe I should before I change any more and try to make a big decision about it then I just need to get to know what's going on witch hunt says this is what can make reactive at mindboggling him yeah yeah it can sometimes I saw I forget where I saw it I probably either on Twitter Instagram but somebody was saying react makes simple things easy or complicated things easy and easy things complicated or something like that and I could see yet like some things are really easy with react and some things are like if I was just using jQuery this would be so easy but all in all I really do like react I think it's worth it's worth the occasional headaches to try to do a thing that would otherwise be pretty easy and in this case I don't necessarily think it's Reax fault I think it's just we had initially organized this without thinking about doing anything like this so you know obviously it's it's not gonna work with with it as is Sebastian says well I keep updating my pull requests with small changes not really following this dream that's cool Sebastian I I'm not gonna complain about that I definitely appreciate the the pull requests and all the changes so I mean I like having you in the live chat as well but that's definitely a great reason sonography paying attention all right well I think I've got through everything in the live chat and I have all about about ten minutes before I need to leave my office and start walking over to the other building where the meetings can be at so thank you so much everyone for for watching for joining in the live chat I appreciate all the all the advice and the suggestions that you have and all the encouragement I I'll be back tomorrow like I said earlier it'll probably end up being a little bit earlier than normal so maybe like 130 p.m. Eastern Time yeah and oh you know special thanks again to everyone who who submits pull requests and things as well that's that's just super helpful and has helped me get a lot better by reviewing you know all this pull requests and seeing how you do everything all right yeah so I'll be back tomorrow and until then have a great day
