00:02 - all right um
00:04 - so how many people are new to
00:06 - programming here anyone
00:09 - a couple people
00:10 - um this is kind of a talk for new people
00:13 - but even if you're not new i think it
00:14 - could help seasoned developers too
00:19 - so this is becoming a better programmer
00:20 - without actually programming
00:24 - let's see
00:25 - now obviously
00:27 - you have to do some programming to
00:28 - become a
00:29 - good programmer i mean
00:32 - but when i jumped into development four
00:33 - years ago i accidentally kind of
00:35 - stumbled upon an invisible step at least
00:37 - for me
00:41 - so my name is ryan johnson i'm a graphic
00:44 - designer and software developer at my
00:47 - consulting group
00:48 - uh
00:50 - i
00:51 - after college i spent about six years as
00:53 - a
00:54 - professional graphic designer
00:56 - and about four years ago i started
00:58 - working for this company in my
00:59 - consulting group and
01:01 - became a full-time developer
01:03 - which is quite a switch
01:06 - at the time everyone told me you know do
01:08 - tutorials
01:10 - think of an application you want to make
01:12 - and create it
01:17 - and i kept hearing the only way to learn
01:20 - to program is
01:22 - to actually program
01:24 - and so you know like everyone else i
01:26 - used
01:28 - you know pluralsight code academy
01:30 - w3 schools udemy things like that even
01:34 - took some classes at o-triple-c
01:37 - and
01:38 - you know that honestly i you know
01:40 - optimist the large a large chunk of the
01:42 - process is developing so it makes sense
01:46 - uh
01:51 - you know
01:52 - unfortunately i'm not up here like with
01:53 - some kind of you know nerd upload i can
01:56 - give you all
01:57 - um instead i kind of the missing
01:59 - ingredient for me was i became good
02:01 - friends with my coworkers
02:03 - and i spent a lot of end up spending a
02:05 - lot of time with them and in that i kind
02:06 - of found my missing ingredient
02:09 - and for me that was full on immersion
02:11 - and
02:13 - just by being around people that loved
02:15 - programming and talking about
02:17 - programming with people i store i sort
02:19 - of
02:20 - started to absorb things and uh
02:23 - you know even
02:26 - even things that went over my head at
02:27 - the time eventually came back around and
02:30 - i understood them just thanks to
02:32 - talking with developers and and
02:34 - also developers seem to have
02:38 - this like obsession with development
02:39 - almost
02:40 - and it kind of gets infectious a little
02:43 - bit you know when i first started as a
02:45 - graphic designer i
02:46 - thought
02:47 - development seemed cool you know
02:49 - programming was wow you know i didn't
02:51 - think i'd ever be able to do that so it
02:53 - seemed so smart
02:54 - and it was kind of scary and the more i
02:56 - got into it though and got around people
02:58 - who enjoyed it
02:59 - it kind of eased that for me
03:01 - as i said coming from the world of
03:03 - graphic design
03:04 - it was all about
03:06 - you know our language was
03:08 - apple computers adobe skinny jeans
03:13 - and
03:14 - it was
03:16 - it was it seemed simple to me but i've
03:17 - done it all my life i guess um
03:20 - then i jumped into the world of
03:21 - development and all of a sudden
03:24 - it sounded really scary at first uh you
03:27 - know words like the dom and backpack
03:31 - and uh even windows i didn't use windows
03:33 - in a long time so
03:35 - and then some weird terms came about too
03:37 - like one of my first few months in
03:40 - development
03:41 - someone asked me
03:42 - would you rubber ducky for me and i was
03:44 - like
03:46 - no
03:49 - weird and even under the covers i have
03:51 - so many arguments with my co-workers
03:53 - because
03:54 - to me it should be under the hood
03:56 - but in the development world it's under
03:58 - the covers for some reason which just
04:00 - sounds weird to me
04:03 - so
04:05 - so with that hearing all these terms and
04:07 - stuff i kind of realized that it's more
04:08 - than just
04:09 - you know hello world and if statements
04:12 - it's
04:13 - and
04:14 - like i said at first it freaked me out
04:16 - but
04:16 - the more i kind of got to talking about
04:18 - these with people it i started getting
04:21 - relaxed and
04:22 - my big thing was i just i asked
04:24 - questions no matter what no matter how
04:26 - dumb it seemed for instance you know one
04:28 - time uh
04:30 - someone was talking about
04:32 - the view in sql and i had heard the view
04:35 - in
04:36 - as a you know part of the front end and
04:38 - so i was like
04:39 - in my head i'm thinking
04:41 - i must be dumb
04:42 - so i finally asked i was like what what
04:44 - is the view and sequel i don't
04:46 - understand and once i once they
04:48 - explained to me that it's you know this
04:50 - stored procedure type thing i understood
04:52 - it
04:54 - but i think a lot of people are afraid
04:56 - to ask or afraid to discuss things and
04:58 - i think it's important that you don't do
04:59 - that
05:01 - and like in a lot of these terms too
05:02 - when the first time i heard backpack i
05:05 - didn't even want to uh that sounds scary
05:06 - even when they explained it to me it
05:08 - didn't make sense but now that i use it
05:11 - you know
05:12 - monthly i guess it's not like something
05:13 - you touch all the time but
05:15 - i
05:16 - it came back around and it's like oh it
05:18 - was familiar and so it wasn't as scary
05:20 - the next time
05:22 - i'm going to kind of relate this
05:24 - um my idea here
05:27 - to playing guitar because i started
05:28 - playing guitar 11 years old it's
05:30 - something i've done all my life
05:32 - i remember even back then i made the
05:35 - conscious effort to
05:36 - always be holding my guitar
05:39 - because my feeling was
05:41 - guitars are awkward there's just this
05:43 - big piece of wood with strings i mean
05:44 - they're they're not comfortable
05:47 - and so
05:48 - you know yeah i still had to learn
05:50 - chords i still had to learn scales i
05:52 - still had to
05:53 - learn songs but just by holding that
05:55 - guitar all the time when i was watching
05:57 - tv when i was uh
05:59 - you know emailing someone whatever which
06:02 - annoyed my wife you know which annoyed
06:05 - my family i mean just i'm always holding
06:06 - my guitar it's a constant
06:09 - uh
06:10 - but because of that i became really
06:11 - comfortable with my guitar and
06:12 - eventually got better and better
06:14 - and to me that's relatable to this you
06:16 - know immersing yourself in that world
06:18 - you just pick up things that and you get
06:20 - comfortable so that when those
06:22 - different ideas come around it's
06:24 - no big deal
06:28 - and that kind of brings me to
06:30 - you know the next side of this
06:32 - just because
06:34 - like i said i'm four years in
06:36 - and
06:37 - i'm to me i'm still new i mean that's
06:42 - but i can already tell that
06:44 - i have to keep learning or else i'm
06:46 - gonna forget things and it doesn't just
06:47 - mean
06:48 - keep learning the one thing you do you
06:50 - know if you're a c-sharp developer
06:53 - it don't just focus only on c sharp i
06:56 - feel like it helps to learn other
06:58 - languages and other
07:00 - even things that you think you will
07:01 - never touch if it's technology related
07:03 - somehow it always comes back around it
07:05 - seems it's like in the four years i've
07:06 - done this i'll hear things that i'm like
07:09 - i'm you know elixir for instance i'm
07:11 - never gonna work on elixir well now i'm
07:13 - doing a side project that is elixir and
07:15 - so
07:17 - um
07:18 - and so with user groups you know
07:20 - i know we're all here for c sharp but
07:22 - i want to why not try some other groups
07:24 - try ruby or try
07:26 - you know
07:29 - you know whatever just look at what
07:30 - would interest you um
07:32 - and it helps you make friends in the
07:33 - industry and i think that's an important
07:34 - thing to do because
07:36 - you get
07:37 - discussing things outside of work and it
07:39 - can teach you new things that you never
07:41 - even thought you would need
07:42 - and it could come up on the job so
07:46 - and then
07:47 - that goes along with learning a
07:48 - technology don't work
07:49 - that you don't use a work
07:52 - and then also
07:53 - like i said i'm doing a side project
07:55 - right now um creating you know create a
07:57 - side project either alone or with other
07:58 - developers i think that's important
08:00 - uh because
08:02 - you
08:03 - you only learn so much on the job you
08:05 - know you you get kind of a lot of times
08:07 - you get doing the same thing
08:09 - and so
08:10 - you know for me i'm mostly front-end
08:12 - half the time and so i'm making these
08:14 - views over and over well that's going to
08:16 - that's going to make me just kind of
08:18 - become stagnant if i just do that
08:20 - so
08:21 - i met some friends and started working
08:23 - on a side project that's angular 6 and
08:28 - elixir and
08:30 - you know functional programming that
08:31 - definitely is a term that would have
08:32 - scared me at the beginning but
08:34 - i've been to some user groups and heard
08:36 - about it and why not let's try it you
08:38 - know
08:39 - and uh
08:41 - you know the other thing that i often
08:42 - hear with from people is
08:44 - that come up and do these talks they'll
08:45 - say they
08:47 - they learned a new skill just to give a
08:48 - talk it was just kind of giving a talk
08:50 - was an excuse to learn a new skill and i
08:52 - think
08:53 - that i mean what a better way to force
08:55 - yourself to learn something you know go
08:56 - sign up for something like this as
08:58 - nerve-wracking as it may be
09:00 - and next thing you know you know this
09:02 - thing that you didn't think you would
09:04 - have otherwise and or maybe even thought
09:06 - you didn't have time for otherwise
09:10 - so again uh ryan johnson um if you guys
09:12 - have any questions
09:14 - yes back here
09:16 - sorry
09:17 - okay
09:19 - what's a dac pack
09:27 - i'm not the best person to answer this
09:28 - question i feel like
09:31 - but you know what this here's a good
09:32 - thing to do now so since you don't know
09:34 - what that is let's do a talk on it
09:40 - so in our next c sharp lightning talks
09:43 - we can expect a talk on backpack come
09:45 - back for that one
09:47 - the other question
09:59 - okay so the question was how do you
10:01 - what's the best way to get over being
10:02 - afraid to ask questions
10:04 - and then the second part of that was uh
10:07 - how do how what's the best way to not
10:09 - sound condescending when you're
10:10 - answering
10:12 - i don't answer a lot of questions so i
10:14 - don't know about that one
10:17 - but even with that one i can at least
10:18 - say it's like when people ask me stuff
10:20 - with graphic design i mean
10:23 - i'm just because i've been doing it for
10:24 - a long time doesn't mean i'm the best at
10:26 - it and so i always try to keep that in
10:28 - mind that there's people way better than
10:30 - me and i'm reminded of it constantly you
10:32 - know i think my logo design was awesome
10:34 - and i'll get online and see someone
10:36 - else's and be like i suck
10:38 - but
10:39 - that's that's part of it so i think if
10:40 - you keep that in mind it's easy to
10:42 - answer questions that way and the first
10:44 - part of that question uh how do you get
10:45 - over the fear of asking questions
10:48 - i mean you
10:49 - if you really want to be good at
10:50 - something you just
10:51 - you're going to have to look dumb but
10:53 - even though if you know even though it
10:55 - feels like you're looking dumb i i think
10:58 - to those people it feels like
11:00 - you're being intelligent by asking a
11:02 - question so i don't think there should
11:04 - be a fear
11:05 - and also developers love to talk about
11:08 - the things they know they love to show
11:09 - how smart they are or something so
11:11 - uh
11:12 - it's not gonna you know it's not gonna
11:14 - make you look bad at all so another
11:16 - question yeah
11:28 - so ruby on rails when was it
11:31 - this thursday okay
11:34 - 11 30.
11:35 - so come to that and you can learn a new
11:36 - skill like i was saying
11:40 - rubber ducking so i can explain this one
11:43 - uh
11:45 - basically you know how a lot of times
11:47 - you'll be working on something in code
11:49 - and
11:50 - you just you know it but you just can't
11:52 - get it so you'll call someone over and
11:54 - they'll be your rubber duck they won't
11:55 - say anything you'll just look at them
11:57 - and explain what you're doing and
11:58 - somehow it comes to you every single
12:00 - time so some people use actual rubber
12:03 - duckies i guess i don't know it still
12:05 - seems weird to me
12:07 - i usually call it rubber goosing i don't
12:08 - know so

Cleaned transcript:

all right um so how many people are new to programming here anyone a couple people um this is kind of a talk for new people but even if you're not new i think it could help seasoned developers too so this is becoming a better programmer without actually programming let's see now obviously you have to do some programming to become a good programmer i mean but when i jumped into development four

and you can learn a new skill like i was saying rubber ducking so i can explain this one uh basically you know how a lot of times you'll be working on something in code and you just you know it but you just can't get it so you'll call someone over and they'll be your rubber duck they won't say anything you'll just look at them and explain what you're doing and somehow it comes to you every
