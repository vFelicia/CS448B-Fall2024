00:00 - let's talk a little bit about why you
00:02 - put your CSS tags in the header and your
00:05 - script tags in the footer
00:07 - maybe you've been told to do that but
00:09 - you're not sure why if you're going to
00:10 - be linking in your HTML document to an
00:13 - external CSS or script if you're going
00:17 - to put those in it's important that you
00:18 - put those links in the right places
00:20 - let's talk about why maybe you've seen a
00:23 - web page where all of the text is loaded
00:26 - and it looks like there's no additional
00:27 - font there's no formatting and as the
00:30 - page continues to load then it all kinda
00:32 - goes into place and starts to look
00:34 - prettier that is an example of a page
00:36 - where the CSS is not necessarily in the
00:39 - header and the script is not necessarily
00:40 - in the footer there's an event called
00:43 - Dom content loaded why that matters is
00:47 - the Dom the document object model is
00:49 - inside the browser and it's seeing all
00:52 - the information from a web page from the
00:54 - HTML the CSS and once it has all that
00:57 - information loaded to a certain point
00:59 - that do and we'll say okay it is loaded
01:03 - enough for us to display it for the user
01:06 - what could happen is the CSS is not in
01:09 - the header the document object model can
01:11 - think that it's ready to show the user
01:13 - but the formatting hasn't actually
01:15 - loaded yet same goes with the JavaScript
01:18 - or whatever script you are using if it's
01:21 - not in the footer that time where the
01:23 - event happens the content loaded for the
01:26 - document object model might not totally
01:28 - line up for the best user experience
01:30 - luckily the fix is easy do as you've
01:33 - been told and put the CSS in the header
01:35 - and the JavaScript in the footer to
01:37 - ensure that your users have everything
01:38 - load and be viewable to them when it's
01:41 - actually the way that you want it to be
01:43 - seen as all of these videos this is just
01:46 - a simple and basic explanation check out
