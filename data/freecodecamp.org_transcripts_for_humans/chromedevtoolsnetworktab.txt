00:00 - all right I am on the free code Camp
00:02 - homepage and I have opened up the
00:04 - developer tools I did it this time by
00:06 - going to view developer and developer
00:08 - tools came right up and I went to the
00:10 - network tab um so here some stuff was
00:13 - already loaded based on when I opened um
00:17 - when I opened the developer tools and
00:19 - when I refreshed the page if I refresh
00:21 - again you'll notice a whole lot of
00:24 - information what we're most interested
00:25 - in is this network
00:27 - tab here there are all of these
00:29 - different colorcoded things each one of
00:31 - them represents a different item on the
00:33 - page so here on the lower side it
00:36 - actually lists them out like this image
00:39 - which if we right click or if we double
00:42 - click pardon me it comes up and this is
00:45 - the GIF the Googling GIF that it shows
00:48 - so here it shows the timing of
00:50 - everything the content download took the
00:53 - longest it was almost 67
00:55 - milliseconds
00:57 - um basically this is useful it's
01:00 - colorcoded so once you're comfortable
01:02 - with the colors mean you can really at a
01:04 - quick glance look through and say okay
01:06 - well this item took a really long time
01:09 - what is that and this gift took a lot
01:12 - longer to load than anything else so if
01:14 - your page or your app was taking a
01:16 - really long time to load or to get a
01:19 - request something was taking a long time
01:21 - the network tab could kind of help you
01:23 - figure out exactly what it was if it was
01:25 - the request getting sent out if it was
01:27 - waiting like this one was the reest sent
01:30 - out really fast it was just waiting the
01:31 - content download was quick too so it
01:34 - helps you figure out exactly where the
01:36 - problem is and pinpoint it so you can
01:37 - fix it really
01:39 - quickly just like all my other videos
01:41 - I'm going to tell you go look at the
01:43 - documentation it is awesome it is super
01:45 - helpful and very easy to read and
01:47 - in-depth at the same time but what I
01:50 - want you to take away from this video is
01:52 - the network tab is where you can look at
01:54 - how long each part of a request is
01:56 - taking for every single aspect in your
01:58 - web page
