With timestamps:

00:00 - So, back to kind of the GitHub workflow.
You create a branch, you make commits, you
00:05 - have a conversation, and maybe add some more commits. What about when it's time
00:09 - to bring your changes back into master
branch? That's when you merge your branch.
00:14 - Now, there's a couple different ways to
do it. In the pull request you can merge
00:18 - directly on github.com, so you would merge on the remote bringing your branch's
00:23 - changes and commits onto this master
branch.
00:27 - You can also merge locally with 'git
merge'. Now, merging by itself isn't that
00:33 - complex of a topic but there are a lot
of different ways you can merge and some
00:37 - problems you can run into. We'll get into
those in some of our next videos.
