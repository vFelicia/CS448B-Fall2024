00:08 - hi everybody
00:10 - I'm Jesse wykel and I'm a front-end
00:14 - developer and this is my first live
00:18 - stream for free code camp I've done some
00:21 - live streams on my own channel but this
00:25 - is the first one on free code camp which
00:28 - is has a lot more subscribers this is an
00:33 - awesome opportunity to hopefully help
00:37 - some more people the goal of this live
00:40 - stream is just to show you what when my
00:44 - job is like as a front-end developer so
00:47 - I I'm not preparing a lot of stuff in
00:50 - advance on purpose because I want you to
00:53 - see my mistakes and see how I work
00:56 - through mistakes and frustration and
00:59 - kind of fouled how ideas just come to
01:03 - you when when you're working you know
01:05 - sometimes sometimes you think of awesome
01:09 - things that you didn't even plan because
01:11 - of some difficulty that you're having so
01:13 - I kind of want to show that aspect of it
01:17 - so if you want to check out my other
01:20 - videos I have my youtube channel up on
01:25 - the screen now you can also reach me at
01:28 - Twitter it's just Jesse or Weigel the
01:31 - project were working on now the repos is
01:34 - live you can check out the code follow
01:36 - along and just to bring you up-to-date
01:39 - here's the plan we're going to build a
01:42 - site at first it's just going to be a
01:43 - static HTML site CSS JavaScript the goal
01:48 - is to convert it into a react site so we
01:52 - convert everything into components I'd
01:55 - like to pull data from the WordPress API
01:58 - render it on the server side with react
02:02 - and then have it be served to the client
02:07 - already pre-rendered it'll be good for
02:09 - search engines like that
02:13 - but that's kind of the longer-term plan
02:15 - for now we're just working with the
02:17 - static site so I explained more in depth
02:24 - about why I'm doing this and what we're
02:26 - gonna be doing in my video yesterday so
02:28 - if you want to later check that out on
02:31 - my site I'm not going to go into it
02:33 - again for the people that might be
02:35 - tuning in that did yesterday I can see
02:40 - all right you guys are really positive
02:43 - in the in the comments they're so
02:46 - awesome
02:47 - I'm going to try to keep up with the
02:49 - live chat if I can I know there's some
02:53 - delay so I might already be talking
02:58 - about something else by the time I see
03:00 - your comments so I apologize if I'm a
03:01 - little slow on that so let's get started
03:07 - I'm going to show you what I'm working
03:07 - on I'm taking a site that's partially
03:11 - finished and I'm going to I'm going to
03:15 - finish it but I'm going to redesign it a
03:17 - little bit the goal is this is a site
03:20 - for a department in Franciscan
03:24 - University the University of self has a
03:26 - style guide and brand standards for
03:28 - websites and then this particular
03:30 - department has a certain style that
03:33 - they're trying to achieve so we need to
03:35 - blend those two styles together
03:37 - respecting the university's branch
03:39 - standards but then trying to really stay
03:44 - true to the vision of this particular
03:46 - department and we have a really short
03:49 - time frame for the site I want to at
03:51 - least get this the static portion of
03:54 - this slice done by Monday so I have a
03:59 - colleague of mine setting up some
04:01 - servers and things so that it will save
04:04 - us some time in a later video we might
04:07 - get into some of the server stuff when
04:09 - we need to set up node and express and
04:12 - react but for now right before I started
04:17 - the stream I'm working on a header so
04:20 - I'll show you let me show you the home
04:23 - page quickly just
04:26 - to recap from from yesterday I added a
04:29 - few things remember we added this hero
04:33 - image you have this picture back here
04:34 - we're going to change this phone at some
04:36 - point but for now it's it's okay it
04:38 - works we have the sticky knife when we
04:40 - scroll down and what we added were these
04:47 - these cards here these image cards the
04:50 - other side had had something similar not
04:54 - quite with the same effects we're trying
04:56 - to keep kind of like a material design
05:02 - feel to things that's what at the
05:05 - University we try to follow material
05:08 - design patterns it just brings a nice
05:10 - consistency to everything we had a
05:15 - question about static websites and react
05:17 - so the reason I'm building a static
05:19 - website first and then moving to react
05:22 - is because my timeline is so short I'm
05:26 - afraid it might not be possible to build
05:30 - it all out and react and get all the
05:32 - custom post types and WordPress and
05:34 - everything ready before we need to
05:36 - launch so if I can't get it already
05:40 - at least the static site will be ready
05:42 - to launch the drawback is people can't
05:45 - edit that content in in WordPress I'd
05:48 - like to use that for the content
05:50 - management because it's so easy for
05:51 - people who don't know code to edit but
05:56 - to kind of buy more time we're doing a
06:00 - static first and then there'll be
06:04 - something up it won't be as easily
06:06 - editable but at least there'll be
06:08 - something up for launch it will be fast
06:10 - and then when we change it to react from
06:12 - a user's perspective there really won't
06:14 - be any difference but behind the scenes
06:17 - it'll be a lot easier to to manage and
06:20 - update for the people that are going to
06:24 - be tasked with that so that's why I'm
06:26 - doing it like that when it comes to
06:30 - angular versus react I've worked with
06:33 - both I haven't I've just done some some
06:38 - fun side things with
06:40 - angular I haven't actually done you know
06:42 - production-ready sites for clients with
06:44 - angular but I do like it I have actually
06:49 - launched sites with react and I like it
06:54 - as well so I'm a big believer in using
06:57 - the tool that's best for what your
07:00 - project is so if you know I don't take
07:05 - sides in angular versus react so and I'm
07:09 - not I don't know that I'm qualified to
07:11 - go into which is best for which
07:13 - situation but in this case since I'm Way
07:18 - more familiar with react and we have
07:20 - such a tight deadline that's you know
07:23 - that's kind of the only thing I could go
07:25 - with in such a short timeframe that I
07:28 - knew for sure I could get launched and a
07:30 - little it would work okay all right this
07:36 - the home page the only other thing we
07:38 - did from that's different from yesterday
07:40 - is we added these little these little
07:42 - background images here these were in the
07:45 - original site that's partially completed
07:47 - and the the client the people from the
07:51 - the department the catechetical
07:54 - Institute they really love these little
07:58 - kind of flourishes here so we're going
07:59 - to try to keep these in as much as we
08:01 - can and um these are actually done with
08:06 - a double background image so I'll show
08:09 - you that real quick because I kind of
08:11 - thought that was cool it's something
08:13 - that I really learned how to do somewhat
08:15 - recently so I'll show you that quickly
08:17 - before we move on to new stuff here's my
08:20 - I'm working with sass so it's not
08:24 - straight CSS the success so it's
08:26 - slightly different if you're not used to
08:28 - that that type of syntax so if you see
08:31 - we have two background images just
08:34 - separated by a comma and then when we go
08:37 - to position them we just separate the
08:39 - positions with a comma as well and then
08:41 - that's how we can get these two images
08:44 - to be exactly where we want them and we
08:47 - don't have to I think the original site
08:49 - had you know nested divs with background
08:52 - images
08:53 - so I think this this is a cleaner way to
08:56 - do it it keeps the the code is certainly
08:59 - more clean to look at without all those
09:01 - nested divs and all the div was really
09:03 - there for was just to have the
09:04 - background image it didn't serve any
09:06 - other purpose so I don't know that was
09:09 - kind of cool and new to me so maybe
09:12 - it'll be useful for you guys and I'm
09:15 - sorry I'm not keeping up that well with
09:17 - with the chat this is kind of difficult
09:21 - I usually don't have as many people
09:22 - chatting all at once so I'll do my best
09:25 - but I'd like to you know get to work and
09:28 - show you some of some what I'm doing so
09:31 - I'm going to go back to this page this
09:33 - interior base team dot HTML so all I did
09:37 - so far was I duplicated the index page
09:40 - and we need to make an interior header
09:45 - because the way that other header was
09:47 - set up it really depended on that that
09:49 - big kind of hero section and I don't
09:54 - want that here a section on every single
09:56 - page I don't know about you but I find
10:00 - it somewhat annoying if there's like the
10:01 - same big hero section on every page at
10:04 - some point I just want to get to the
10:06 - content without having to you know see
10:08 - that section so I don't want to have a
10:10 - big hero section on every page so we
10:12 - need to make an alternate version of the
10:14 - header for all the interior pages so
10:16 - that's what I've done so all I've done
10:17 - so far is just remove the hero section
10:19 - and now I'm just kind of working on the
10:24 - logo size and you can see it's we're
10:26 - right in the middle of this we need to
10:28 - make this logo I'd like to have it as
10:31 - small as possible and still be readable
10:33 - I'd love to have it as thin of a header
10:36 - as possible so that the content is is
10:38 - clearly visible we're going to keep this
10:40 - part of the header a kind of sticky as
10:45 - we scroll down just like on the home
10:48 - page and then that will give us a nice
10:50 - slim header but it'll still allow people
10:53 - to navigate anywhere in the site and
10:56 - without having to scroll all the way up
10:57 - we also have in place to scroll to top
11:00 - button once you scroll down so far so I
11:04 - mean that that will be useful as well
11:06 - it's nice to have both of those options
11:09 - so people can navigate really quickly
11:12 - okay so let's get to it I'm going to
11:17 - become a switching switching around a
11:20 - little bit here and I'm going to bring
11:21 - in dev tools such as chrome dev tools
11:25 - here for this site and right now I was
11:28 - just looking at this image and just kind
11:35 - of trying to mess with the size so I'm
11:38 - going to try to take this down
11:41 - let's try take it down to 70 pixels do
11:45 - have some smaller you know really thin
11:48 - font here so we might not be able to get
11:50 - away with it being that that small I
11:55 - Alexander just says he likes Adam better
11:57 - than sublime text I like Adam as well
12:00 - I've never used sublime text mainly just
12:03 - because sublime text cost money and Adam
12:06 - didn't and when I started to really get
12:08 - into front-end development I was on my
12:11 - own and freelancing and pretty broke at
12:13 - first so I always preferred the free
12:17 - stuff but I think both of them from what
12:19 - I've seen of other other developers
12:22 - using sublime text they're pretty
12:24 - similar but I can't speak to it from my
12:27 - own experience I've also use Visual
12:31 - Studio code whenever I have to work on
12:36 - like.net projects I usually use Visual
12:40 - Studio code mainly because I just it was
12:43 - faster than trying to get the right
12:45 - package for Adam to do the same type of
12:48 - syntax highlighting that Visual Studio
12:50 - code did right off the bat okay so we
12:59 - shrunk that down to 70 and now let's
13:03 - take this this navbar and we'll make it
13:09 - a little bit taller there we go
13:12 - and the brand logo I think we can get
13:17 - away with a smaller margin at the top
13:19 - and that'll save us some space so we'll
13:22 - take that down all the way we we've
13:25 - decreased that top margin by 50% there
13:27 - that'll buy us a lot of space and then
13:30 - that means we can come in here and we
13:33 - can make this just a bit smaller okay
13:38 - that's nice I name is probably about as
13:39 - good as we're going to get for now the
13:42 - last thing we need to do let's see
13:48 - need to figure out why this isn't going
13:50 - up you'll find as I do these videos a
13:57 - lot of it it's just trying to figure out
14:01 - what is going on on the page I am using
14:04 - a framework I'm using materialized as a
14:08 - framework I like that because it has the
14:12 - material design style is kind of built
14:14 - right in and that's why you see all
14:19 - these classes and everything a lot of
14:20 - that's already built in I definitely if
14:24 - you have a site where you need a lot of
14:26 - functionality that a framework can give
14:27 - you I recommend it it saves you it saves
14:30 - so much time I think it's kind of cool
14:32 - to make a site entirely from scratch and
14:34 - it can be really fast and awesome but
14:37 - the reality is sometimes you just have
14:40 - tight deadlines and you can't do it like
14:41 - that okay where is this coming from
14:49 - well let's just check this out see maybe
14:52 - I have it never the line oh I can't
15:00 - figure that out right now so let's come
15:01 - in here and make some of these changes
15:03 - here that I just made over here in dev
15:09 - tools
15:14 - all right I'm going to move their tools
15:16 - off to the side here for a second just
15:18 - so I can copy the same changes we just
15:20 - made over into our live our live code
15:25 - here and I'm using gulp to do the live
15:30 - reload so every time we edit this it'll
15:33 - automatically refresh this page okay so
15:38 - here's right now if we want to go down
15:41 - that's the original nav that's the home
15:43 - page but we want to go down here to
15:45 - interior so I've given the header tag
15:49 - let me bring up the HTML so you guys can
15:52 - see that too okay so we've given the
15:54 - header the class of interior so
15:59 - everything else for this interior thing
16:01 - is going to fall within this and we nest
16:04 - things we're using sass everything's
16:06 - kind of nested makes it easier to write
16:09 - things like this the CSS that comes out
16:14 - afterwards that's generated can look a
16:17 - little weird at times with lots of tags
16:19 - but the development process for me at
16:22 - least is a lot faster using sass okay so
16:28 - here's what we did we made that nav will
16:35 - we get 88 pixels as the height and
16:43 - excuse any sloppiness in the code
16:46 - usually I try to go and clean this stuff
16:49 - up after our live stream so don't spend
16:52 - a lot of my time just worrying about
16:54 - indentation and style okay we need that
17:01 - okay we got the margin bottom there and
17:04 - so I think all we need to change is the
17:06 - brand logo image and we drop that down
17:13 - to 70 pixels and then for the brand logo
17:17 - itself for that it's actually an a tag
17:21 - that contains the the image we drop that
17:26 - top margin down to 8 pixels
17:28 - from 16
17:49 - okay
17:53 - okay I'm reading a little bit of your
17:55 - conversation here did I make a plan or
17:57 - plan my planning on the go I am planning
18:04 - a bit on the go so the overall plan is
18:06 - is set but the little details we have to
18:12 - take this on the go I just found out
18:14 - yesterday morning that I was going to be
18:15 - taking on this project and it needs to
18:18 - be done by Monday so I kind of have to
18:21 - plan a little bit on the go and in this
18:23 - case I am a little bit of a designer and
18:26 - a developer I don't I don't actually
18:30 - work with a web designer so most of them
18:35 - most what I do is kind of a combination
18:38 - of design and development that's why I
18:40 - do like to go with material design a lot
18:42 - because I don't really consider myself a
18:44 - designer so a lot of these design
18:48 - decisions
18:49 - I just rely on the material design
18:51 - framework for it saves me a lot of time
18:53 - and it lets me have consistency okay so
19:03 - great that all worked we save that and
19:06 - [Music]
19:09 - not we need to really need to figure out
19:15 - why this gap is here so I like to go in
19:18 - when I'm trying to figure that this kind
19:20 - of thing out to the computed tab and
19:23 - then that way I can see this and I just
19:26 - run through all my elements and try to
19:31 - figure out which there we go see when I
19:35 - did that I can see the height of the
19:37 - element here and then I can also see the
19:39 - highlight that blue highlight and I can
19:41 - see that's my problem there is that I
19:44 - have a height on my header which is the
19:48 - container for all the nav stuff I need
19:51 - to get rid of that height I need to drop
19:53 - that down I need to get rid of it
19:54 - completely let's see I think that's
19:57 - probably the best thing we'll just get
19:59 - rid of the height we don't need it on
20:01 - there we have the interior element here
20:04 - nav we have the height for the
20:06 - oops so let's do that let's go up we'll
20:11 - go here and we'll set height hmm let's
20:22 - try this if I can I'd like to just get
20:24 - rid of that height entirely and we might
20:28 - be able to so I'm going to go all the
20:30 - way up here to the original header and
20:34 - I'm just going to comment this up
20:36 - quickly and I want to look at local hoes
20:43 - oops
20:45 - okay I need three thousand one okay
20:55 - great so that's not really going to
20:57 - affect the homepage either so that was
21:00 - just some code left over that we didn't
21:03 - really need this was copied over most of
21:06 - this markup was copied over from a
21:08 - template that I created that had some of
21:12 - the basic Styles that the university
21:13 - likes to use and I created a template so
21:17 - that if I needed to do this like quickly
21:18 - I could just download the template it's
21:23 - available on my github profile I can
21:25 - download that template and get right
21:28 - right to work and not have to worry
21:29 - about a lot of you know the normal
21:31 - things that you do every time you do a
21:35 - site so there's there's definitely going
21:38 - to be some CSS JavaScript and HTML that
21:43 - are unnecessary and we'll clean that up
21:45 - when we get a chance before we launch
21:50 - okay I keep it on my time we get about
21:53 - nine minutes left let's see how much we
21:55 - can get done okay we're back here
21:59 - alright this headers is okay I think
22:02 - we're kind of boarding bordering here on
22:04 - unreadable 'ti with this logo here we
22:06 - may have to make it a little bit bigger
22:08 - but I think it's good enough right now
22:10 - to give us an idea of how it will be
22:12 - this section here could probably be
22:14 - thinner so that's another area where we
22:16 - could you know save on some height
22:19 - I think this is a yeah this this is thin
22:22 - enough we may add some things over here
22:26 - if we need to this is a great place
22:28 - maybe for call-to-action button so great
22:35 - so you see that's thinking I was working
22:38 - and for this page this is going to be a
22:42 - team page so for every page there's
22:47 - interior page is going to be a title I'd
22:48 - like to have a place where that title is
22:50 - going to be either right here or
22:53 - potentially if we have all this black
22:56 - area up here we we could have it here
23:00 - you know it might look nice to kind of
23:04 - tie it together if we took that same
23:06 - background image from the hero section
23:08 - and we popped it in right here on this
23:10 - side we have to shrink it down a little
23:12 - bit but I think that's worth to try to
23:14 - see how it looks and it shouldn't be too
23:17 - hard because we we already have a lot of
23:20 - the mark-up for that to be the
23:21 - background sums can go in here and I'm
23:24 - going to find that hero section and we
23:28 - had it we gave it an idea of hero right
23:33 - now my SAS is basically in the order it
23:37 - appears on the page that the elements
23:39 - here on the page when this all gets
23:40 - converted to react you know all this
23:43 - won't matter we're going to try to make
23:44 - the components a self-contained as
23:46 - possible and break the CSS up so I'm not
23:49 - that worried about organization at this
23:51 - point so let's just grab all these
23:58 - background properties and I'm not going
24:03 - to worry about these media queries we're
24:05 - going to use different sizes I had to
24:07 - make vid sizes yet but eventually we're
24:09 - going to use different sizes depending
24:11 - on the screen width and we'll probably
24:16 - want to do that with this other nav as
24:19 - well I'm not going to do it right now
24:23 - since we're running a little bit short
24:25 - I'd like to at least get this in there
24:26 - so we can see what it looks like
24:28 - oops here we go with this interior
24:33 - and let's go on Ave and let's copy this
24:38 - all in it's gonna look weird at first I
24:40 - think but then oh slowly nothing at
24:44 - first
24:46 - alright let's see what's going on here
24:49 - let's check the nav out okay we have the
24:52 - image there let's see let's just start
24:57 - taking off some of these let's see if we
24:59 - can huh try to take off as much as I can
25:10 - just to see if we could look we can see
25:13 - it see why it's not working soon okay at
25:20 - least we can see it now so we know is
25:21 - there we definitely don't want that but
25:23 - I mean how cool would that have looked
25:25 - in the 90s and that would have been
25:28 - awesome I'm going to what I really
25:34 - wanted to do is just convey over here so
25:38 - we're definitely going to click that no
25:40 - repeat for the background here we can
25:42 - see it's on this side right now we don't
25:44 - want it on that side so let's go to this
25:46 - background position X and this make lets
25:50 - us move it from one side to the other so
25:53 - the background position X is at 183
25:56 - percent right now so let's just let's
25:59 - just do something simple and say write
26:01 - great okay so that puts it on the right
26:04 - we'll go back to your percentage when we
26:06 - need to really position it you know more
26:09 - accurately but for now this puts it
26:11 - where we want it it's definitely too
26:12 - small so let's go back to this this
26:15 - height prep and nope that's not what I
26:19 - wanted um background size let's see what
26:26 - we're going to do with the size of it
26:29 - okay what we might need to do with the
26:31 - size let's go with let's just see if we
26:39 - can get it to look right here hmm
26:43 - exactly
26:51 - all right so I can't see that at all
26:54 - right now the specter background covered
26:57 - I had gotten the same issue with the
26:59 - hero section I think I did that off not
27:02 - on a live stream so this is kind of what
27:07 - happens especially when you're kind of
27:09 - designing and developing on the go
27:10 - together sometimes you just keep
27:13 - changing values to see what happens so
27:15 - oh I had it contain okay we've got three
27:25 - minutes let's see let's turn that fixed
27:30 - back on I think they don't want to fix I
27:33 - think I want that off for the hero
27:36 - section we put set a background
27:37 - attachment fixed property and that kind
27:39 - of gave us a little parallax effects you
27:42 - can see that that here but I don't think
27:45 - we want that with the header I don't
27:47 - think that's um
27:48 - I don't think that would be expected
27:50 - behavior for you know just that header
27:53 - section anyway so we're going to get rid
27:56 - of that let me just take that out of
27:58 - there right now and when we get it right
28:01 - we'll just copy and paste this whole
28:02 - thing over and let's see background
28:05 - sighs oh I see what we did I never took
28:11 - out the original background sighs
28:13 - property that we had for the hero
28:16 - section so let's remember to clean that
28:17 - up at some point okay but now we can
28:21 - change the size here and see see what's
28:24 - going on and then the background
28:27 - position why there we go okay how so I
28:30 - thought so now we can see we've got this
28:33 - this image here
28:35 - we just need to mess with the sizes a
28:38 - bit so I'm gonna bring this position
28:41 - back back up again
28:44 - oops accidentally just put that I'll
28:50 - just take one of them out because we
28:51 - have it already on that element okay so
28:57 - let's see
28:59 - I think I needs to be a little bit
29:01 - smaller let's see you
29:19 - okay all right I don't love that I think
29:25 - it maybe needs a little bit of work but
29:28 - that gives us an idea of what it might
29:30 - look like you know over here we'll have
29:34 - to check it on when it shrinks actually
29:38 - that that kind of even works on a
29:41 - smaller okay it finally starts to
29:43 - overlap here so we'll definitely have to
29:45 - do something about that when we get you
29:47 - notice a more narrow screen but for now
29:53 - that gives us a good idea kind of the
29:55 - direction we want to go with that header
29:58 - all right so we have about a minute left
30:00 - I okay somebody said Thanks yeah you're
30:05 - welcome
30:06 - um so I'm glad you guys watched it looks
30:10 - like this there's a ton of people
30:12 - watching so I'm super excited about that
30:15 - thanks for all the conversation I'm
30:18 - sorry I couldn't keep up with it I'm
30:19 - gonna go back after this and read
30:21 - through everything and maybe I can
30:24 - respond in the comments and if you have
30:27 - any questions just you know comment I'll
30:29 - try to get to them as much as I can
30:33 - Brian Sizemore is brought to you by G
30:36 - fuel he works with me and he knows that
30:38 - before my live streams I drink G fuel
30:40 - it's an energy drink so I don't sound
30:42 - like I'm I'm half asleep so anyway I
30:47 - don't want to go too far over 30 minutes
30:49 - so I think that's super long to try to
30:51 - watch a video thanks again for watching
30:54 - I'll be back tomorrow every day at 2
30:59 - p.m. unless some emergency comes up I'm
31:01 - going to be streaming Monday through
31:03 - Friday 2 p.m. Eastern Time
31:06 - there'll be a recording available right
31:08 - after that it will automatically post to
31:10 - the channel so at at about 2:30 the
31:14 - recording will be there and I'll either
31:18 - be on this channel on free code camp or
31:21 - I'll be on my own channel if you just
31:24 - look up Jesse Weigel in YouTube it will
31:27 - be the first bunch of videos that come
31:29 - up probably I think there's one other
31:31 - Jesse
31:32 - I go on YouTube right now so I'll see
31:36 - you guys tomorrow I'll be back tomorrow
31:40 - and hopefully I'll have more of this
31:42 - site done because it needs to be done
31:44 - but I had a great time and let me know
31:48 - if there's any tips for me I'm still
31:50 - pretty new at this live-streaming thing
31:51 - so definitely any tips are are very
31:55 - welcome all right so I'll end the stream
32:00 - now thanks again have a great day I'll
32:04 - be back tomorrow
32:05 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hi everybody I'm Jesse wykel and I'm a frontend developer and this is my first live stream for free code camp I've done some live streams on my own channel but this is the first one on free code camp which is has a lot more subscribers this is an awesome opportunity to hopefully help some more people the goal of this live stream is just to show you what when my job is like as a frontend developer so I I'm not preparing a lot of stuff in advance on purpose because I want you to see my mistakes and see how I work through mistakes and frustration and kind of fouled how ideas just come to you when when you're working you know sometimes sometimes you think of awesome things that you didn't even plan because of some difficulty that you're having so I kind of want to show that aspect of it so if you want to check out my other videos I have my youtube channel up on the screen now you can also reach me at Twitter it's just Jesse or Weigel the project were working on now the repos is live you can check out the code follow along and just to bring you uptodate here's the plan we're going to build a site at first it's just going to be a static HTML site CSS JavaScript the goal is to convert it into a react site so we convert everything into components I'd like to pull data from the WordPress API render it on the server side with react and then have it be served to the client already prerendered it'll be good for search engines like that but that's kind of the longerterm plan for now we're just working with the static site so I explained more in depth about why I'm doing this and what we're gonna be doing in my video yesterday so if you want to later check that out on my site I'm not going to go into it again for the people that might be tuning in that did yesterday I can see all right you guys are really positive in the in the comments they're so awesome I'm going to try to keep up with the live chat if I can I know there's some delay so I might already be talking about something else by the time I see your comments so I apologize if I'm a little slow on that so let's get started I'm going to show you what I'm working on I'm taking a site that's partially finished and I'm going to I'm going to finish it but I'm going to redesign it a little bit the goal is this is a site for a department in Franciscan University the University of self has a style guide and brand standards for websites and then this particular department has a certain style that they're trying to achieve so we need to blend those two styles together respecting the university's branch standards but then trying to really stay true to the vision of this particular department and we have a really short time frame for the site I want to at least get this the static portion of this slice done by Monday so I have a colleague of mine setting up some servers and things so that it will save us some time in a later video we might get into some of the server stuff when we need to set up node and express and react but for now right before I started the stream I'm working on a header so I'll show you let me show you the home page quickly just to recap from from yesterday I added a few things remember we added this hero image you have this picture back here we're going to change this phone at some point but for now it's it's okay it works we have the sticky knife when we scroll down and what we added were these these cards here these image cards the other side had had something similar not quite with the same effects we're trying to keep kind of like a material design feel to things that's what at the University we try to follow material design patterns it just brings a nice consistency to everything we had a question about static websites and react so the reason I'm building a static website first and then moving to react is because my timeline is so short I'm afraid it might not be possible to build it all out and react and get all the custom post types and WordPress and everything ready before we need to launch so if I can't get it already at least the static site will be ready to launch the drawback is people can't edit that content in in WordPress I'd like to use that for the content management because it's so easy for people who don't know code to edit but to kind of buy more time we're doing a static first and then there'll be something up it won't be as easily editable but at least there'll be something up for launch it will be fast and then when we change it to react from a user's perspective there really won't be any difference but behind the scenes it'll be a lot easier to to manage and update for the people that are going to be tasked with that so that's why I'm doing it like that when it comes to angular versus react I've worked with both I haven't I've just done some some fun side things with angular I haven't actually done you know productionready sites for clients with angular but I do like it I have actually launched sites with react and I like it as well so I'm a big believer in using the tool that's best for what your project is so if you know I don't take sides in angular versus react so and I'm not I don't know that I'm qualified to go into which is best for which situation but in this case since I'm Way more familiar with react and we have such a tight deadline that's you know that's kind of the only thing I could go with in such a short timeframe that I knew for sure I could get launched and a little it would work okay all right this the home page the only other thing we did from that's different from yesterday is we added these little these little background images here these were in the original site that's partially completed and the the client the people from the the department the catechetical Institute they really love these little kind of flourishes here so we're going to try to keep these in as much as we can and um these are actually done with a double background image so I'll show you that real quick because I kind of thought that was cool it's something that I really learned how to do somewhat recently so I'll show you that quickly before we move on to new stuff here's my I'm working with sass so it's not straight CSS the success so it's slightly different if you're not used to that that type of syntax so if you see we have two background images just separated by a comma and then when we go to position them we just separate the positions with a comma as well and then that's how we can get these two images to be exactly where we want them and we don't have to I think the original site had you know nested divs with background images so I think this this is a cleaner way to do it it keeps the the code is certainly more clean to look at without all those nested divs and all the div was really there for was just to have the background image it didn't serve any other purpose so I don't know that was kind of cool and new to me so maybe it'll be useful for you guys and I'm sorry I'm not keeping up that well with with the chat this is kind of difficult I usually don't have as many people chatting all at once so I'll do my best but I'd like to you know get to work and show you some of some what I'm doing so I'm going to go back to this page this interior base team dot HTML so all I did so far was I duplicated the index page and we need to make an interior header because the way that other header was set up it really depended on that that big kind of hero section and I don't want that here a section on every single page I don't know about you but I find it somewhat annoying if there's like the same big hero section on every page at some point I just want to get to the content without having to you know see that section so I don't want to have a big hero section on every page so we need to make an alternate version of the header for all the interior pages so that's what I've done so all I've done so far is just remove the hero section and now I'm just kind of working on the logo size and you can see it's we're right in the middle of this we need to make this logo I'd like to have it as small as possible and still be readable I'd love to have it as thin of a header as possible so that the content is is clearly visible we're going to keep this part of the header a kind of sticky as we scroll down just like on the home page and then that will give us a nice slim header but it'll still allow people to navigate anywhere in the site and without having to scroll all the way up we also have in place to scroll to top button once you scroll down so far so I mean that that will be useful as well it's nice to have both of those options so people can navigate really quickly okay so let's get to it I'm going to become a switching switching around a little bit here and I'm going to bring in dev tools such as chrome dev tools here for this site and right now I was just looking at this image and just kind of trying to mess with the size so I'm going to try to take this down let's try take it down to 70 pixels do have some smaller you know really thin font here so we might not be able to get away with it being that that small I Alexander just says he likes Adam better than sublime text I like Adam as well I've never used sublime text mainly just because sublime text cost money and Adam didn't and when I started to really get into frontend development I was on my own and freelancing and pretty broke at first so I always preferred the free stuff but I think both of them from what I've seen of other other developers using sublime text they're pretty similar but I can't speak to it from my own experience I've also use Visual Studio code whenever I have to work on like.net projects I usually use Visual Studio code mainly because I just it was faster than trying to get the right package for Adam to do the same type of syntax highlighting that Visual Studio code did right off the bat okay so we shrunk that down to 70 and now let's take this this navbar and we'll make it a little bit taller there we go and the brand logo I think we can get away with a smaller margin at the top and that'll save us some space so we'll take that down all the way we we've decreased that top margin by 50% there that'll buy us a lot of space and then that means we can come in here and we can make this just a bit smaller okay that's nice I name is probably about as good as we're going to get for now the last thing we need to do let's see need to figure out why this isn't going up you'll find as I do these videos a lot of it it's just trying to figure out what is going on on the page I am using a framework I'm using materialized as a framework I like that because it has the material design style is kind of built right in and that's why you see all these classes and everything a lot of that's already built in I definitely if you have a site where you need a lot of functionality that a framework can give you I recommend it it saves you it saves so much time I think it's kind of cool to make a site entirely from scratch and it can be really fast and awesome but the reality is sometimes you just have tight deadlines and you can't do it like that okay where is this coming from well let's just check this out see maybe I have it never the line oh I can't figure that out right now so let's come in here and make some of these changes here that I just made over here in dev tools all right I'm going to move their tools off to the side here for a second just so I can copy the same changes we just made over into our live our live code here and I'm using gulp to do the live reload so every time we edit this it'll automatically refresh this page okay so here's right now if we want to go down that's the original nav that's the home page but we want to go down here to interior so I've given the header tag let me bring up the HTML so you guys can see that too okay so we've given the header the class of interior so everything else for this interior thing is going to fall within this and we nest things we're using sass everything's kind of nested makes it easier to write things like this the CSS that comes out afterwards that's generated can look a little weird at times with lots of tags but the development process for me at least is a lot faster using sass okay so here's what we did we made that nav will we get 88 pixels as the height and excuse any sloppiness in the code usually I try to go and clean this stuff up after our live stream so don't spend a lot of my time just worrying about indentation and style okay we need that okay we got the margin bottom there and so I think all we need to change is the brand logo image and we drop that down to 70 pixels and then for the brand logo itself for that it's actually an a tag that contains the the image we drop that top margin down to 8 pixels from 16 okay okay I'm reading a little bit of your conversation here did I make a plan or plan my planning on the go I am planning a bit on the go so the overall plan is is set but the little details we have to take this on the go I just found out yesterday morning that I was going to be taking on this project and it needs to be done by Monday so I kind of have to plan a little bit on the go and in this case I am a little bit of a designer and a developer I don't I don't actually work with a web designer so most of them most what I do is kind of a combination of design and development that's why I do like to go with material design a lot because I don't really consider myself a designer so a lot of these design decisions I just rely on the material design framework for it saves me a lot of time and it lets me have consistency okay so great that all worked we save that and not we need to really need to figure out why this gap is here so I like to go in when I'm trying to figure that this kind of thing out to the computed tab and then that way I can see this and I just run through all my elements and try to figure out which there we go see when I did that I can see the height of the element here and then I can also see the highlight that blue highlight and I can see that's my problem there is that I have a height on my header which is the container for all the nav stuff I need to get rid of that height I need to drop that down I need to get rid of it completely let's see I think that's probably the best thing we'll just get rid of the height we don't need it on there we have the interior element here nav we have the height for the oops so let's do that let's go up we'll go here and we'll set height hmm let's try this if I can I'd like to just get rid of that height entirely and we might be able to so I'm going to go all the way up here to the original header and I'm just going to comment this up quickly and I want to look at local hoes oops okay I need three thousand one okay great so that's not really going to affect the homepage either so that was just some code left over that we didn't really need this was copied over most of this markup was copied over from a template that I created that had some of the basic Styles that the university likes to use and I created a template so that if I needed to do this like quickly I could just download the template it's available on my github profile I can download that template and get right right to work and not have to worry about a lot of you know the normal things that you do every time you do a site so there's there's definitely going to be some CSS JavaScript and HTML that are unnecessary and we'll clean that up when we get a chance before we launch okay I keep it on my time we get about nine minutes left let's see how much we can get done okay we're back here alright this headers is okay I think we're kind of boarding bordering here on unreadable 'ti with this logo here we may have to make it a little bit bigger but I think it's good enough right now to give us an idea of how it will be this section here could probably be thinner so that's another area where we could you know save on some height I think this is a yeah this this is thin enough we may add some things over here if we need to this is a great place maybe for calltoaction button so great so you see that's thinking I was working and for this page this is going to be a team page so for every page there's interior page is going to be a title I'd like to have a place where that title is going to be either right here or potentially if we have all this black area up here we we could have it here you know it might look nice to kind of tie it together if we took that same background image from the hero section and we popped it in right here on this side we have to shrink it down a little bit but I think that's worth to try to see how it looks and it shouldn't be too hard because we we already have a lot of the markup for that to be the background sums can go in here and I'm going to find that hero section and we had it we gave it an idea of hero right now my SAS is basically in the order it appears on the page that the elements here on the page when this all gets converted to react you know all this won't matter we're going to try to make the components a selfcontained as possible and break the CSS up so I'm not that worried about organization at this point so let's just grab all these background properties and I'm not going to worry about these media queries we're going to use different sizes I had to make vid sizes yet but eventually we're going to use different sizes depending on the screen width and we'll probably want to do that with this other nav as well I'm not going to do it right now since we're running a little bit short I'd like to at least get this in there so we can see what it looks like oops here we go with this interior and let's go on Ave and let's copy this all in it's gonna look weird at first I think but then oh slowly nothing at first alright let's see what's going on here let's check the nav out okay we have the image there let's see let's just start taking off some of these let's see if we can huh try to take off as much as I can just to see if we could look we can see it see why it's not working soon okay at least we can see it now so we know is there we definitely don't want that but I mean how cool would that have looked in the 90s and that would have been awesome I'm going to what I really wanted to do is just convey over here so we're definitely going to click that no repeat for the background here we can see it's on this side right now we don't want it on that side so let's go to this background position X and this make lets us move it from one side to the other so the background position X is at 183 percent right now so let's just let's just do something simple and say write great okay so that puts it on the right we'll go back to your percentage when we need to really position it you know more accurately but for now this puts it where we want it it's definitely too small so let's go back to this this height prep and nope that's not what I wanted um background size let's see what we're going to do with the size of it okay what we might need to do with the size let's go with let's just see if we can get it to look right here hmm exactly all right so I can't see that at all right now the specter background covered I had gotten the same issue with the hero section I think I did that off not on a live stream so this is kind of what happens especially when you're kind of designing and developing on the go together sometimes you just keep changing values to see what happens so oh I had it contain okay we've got three minutes let's see let's turn that fixed back on I think they don't want to fix I think I want that off for the hero section we put set a background attachment fixed property and that kind of gave us a little parallax effects you can see that that here but I don't think we want that with the header I don't think that's um I don't think that would be expected behavior for you know just that header section anyway so we're going to get rid of that let me just take that out of there right now and when we get it right we'll just copy and paste this whole thing over and let's see background sighs oh I see what we did I never took out the original background sighs property that we had for the hero section so let's remember to clean that up at some point okay but now we can change the size here and see see what's going on and then the background position why there we go okay how so I thought so now we can see we've got this this image here we just need to mess with the sizes a bit so I'm gonna bring this position back back up again oops accidentally just put that I'll just take one of them out because we have it already on that element okay so let's see I think I needs to be a little bit smaller let's see you okay all right I don't love that I think it maybe needs a little bit of work but that gives us an idea of what it might look like you know over here we'll have to check it on when it shrinks actually that that kind of even works on a smaller okay it finally starts to overlap here so we'll definitely have to do something about that when we get you notice a more narrow screen but for now that gives us a good idea kind of the direction we want to go with that header all right so we have about a minute left I okay somebody said Thanks yeah you're welcome um so I'm glad you guys watched it looks like this there's a ton of people watching so I'm super excited about that thanks for all the conversation I'm sorry I couldn't keep up with it I'm gonna go back after this and read through everything and maybe I can respond in the comments and if you have any questions just you know comment I'll try to get to them as much as I can Brian Sizemore is brought to you by G fuel he works with me and he knows that before my live streams I drink G fuel it's an energy drink so I don't sound like I'm I'm half asleep so anyway I don't want to go too far over 30 minutes so I think that's super long to try to watch a video thanks again for watching I'll be back tomorrow every day at 2 p.m. unless some emergency comes up I'm going to be streaming Monday through Friday 2 p.m. Eastern Time there'll be a recording available right after that it will automatically post to the channel so at at about 230 the recording will be there and I'll either be on this channel on free code camp or I'll be on my own channel if you just look up Jesse Weigel in YouTube it will be the first bunch of videos that come up probably I think there's one other Jesse I go on YouTube right now so I'll see you guys tomorrow I'll be back tomorrow and hopefully I'll have more of this site done because it needs to be done but I had a great time and let me know if there's any tips for me I'm still pretty new at this livestreaming thing so definitely any tips are are very welcome all right so I'll end the stream now thanks again have a great day I'll be back tomorrow
