00:00 - i want to begin this video by reviewing
00:03 - the definition of complements
00:05 - so the definition of a complement of a
00:07 - set for for instance the complement of a
00:10 - equals the set containing elements x
00:13 - such that x is not an element of a
00:17 - i'll now be going over two new algebraic
00:20 - laws for sets
00:22 - the first are the law of complements
00:25 - the law of complements states that if we
00:27 - take the union of a set and its
00:29 - complement it equals the universe
00:32 - or if you take the complement of the
00:34 - null set it equals the universe
00:36 - furthermore
00:38 - the intersection of a set and its
00:40 - complement is the null set and that
00:42 - should be clear because if you have uh
00:45 - the set a
00:47 - and you are intersecting it with
00:49 - everything that is not inside a
00:52 - there's clearly not going to be any
00:53 - overlap so you're going to have an empty
00:56 - set
00:58 - the next one is the law of involution
01:01 - so involution
01:03 - states that
01:05 - if we have a
01:08 - state here let's call it state zero
01:11 - and we
01:12 - feed that state to a function in this
01:14 - case we're going to feed it to the
01:15 - complement function
01:17 - then when it gets to state 1 if we again
01:20 - feed it through the exact same function
01:21 - the complement function it will result
01:24 - in state 0 again in this case if we fed
01:27 - state
01:28 - if we fed set a
01:30 - through
01:31 - this
01:32 - cyclical function here then we would
01:34 - have a
01:35 - feed it through complement we get a
01:37 - complement feed it back through the
01:38 - function we get a complement complement
01:40 - which equals a and then we can have a
01:43 - complement complement complement which
01:44 - would
01:45 - be a compliment and then you get the
01:47 - idea it's cyclical

i want to begin this video by reviewing the definition of complements so the definition of a complement of a set for for instance the complement of a equals the set containing elements x such that x is not an element of a i'll now be going over two new algebraic laws for sets the first are the law of complements the law of complements states that if we take the union of a set and its complement it equals the universe or if you take the complement of the null set it equals the universe furthermore the intersection of a set and its complement is the null set and that should be clear because if you have uh the set a and you are intersecting it with everything that is not inside a there's clearly not going to be any overlap so you're going to have an empty set the next one is the law of involution so involution states that if we have a state here let's call it state zero and we feed that state to a function in this case we're going to feed it to the complement function then when it gets to state 1 if we again feed it through the exact same function the complement function it will result in state 0 again in this case if we fed state if we fed set a through this cyclical function here then we would have a feed it through complement we get a complement feed it back through the function we get a complement complement which equals a and then we can have a complement complement complement which would be a compliment and then you get the idea it's cyclical
