00:00 - for more videos like this feel free to
00:01 - check out my website tech with Tim net
00:03 - and subscribe to my channel tech with
00:04 - them in this video I'm going to be
00:14 - showing you how to log user key presses
00:16 - and save those key presses in a
00:18 - meaningful way in a text file now the
00:21 - module that we're going to be using for
00:22 - this is PI input you can see right here
00:24 - this is what it's called it is a third
00:26 - party module not included with the
00:28 - default installation of Python which
00:30 - means our first step in this video is
00:31 - going to be installing PI input so what
00:34 - we need to do is obviously we have to go
00:36 - to our command prompt because rich can
00:37 - use pip to do this pretty
00:39 - straightforward bring up your command
00:40 - prompt
00:41 - simply type pip install and then PI and
00:46 - input okay so just forget the I there
00:48 - wait for that to run and once I goes
00:51 - through you should have PI input
00:53 - installed for some reason your pip is
00:55 - not working reinstall Python and when
00:58 - you reinstall python make sure you add
01:00 - or check the box that says add python to
01:03 - path and install pip okay and that
01:06 - should fix your issue if you're having
01:07 - any other problems leave a comment down
01:08 - below
01:09 - okay so we're first what we need to do
01:11 - is we're gonna set up a we need to
01:14 - actually bring these imports in so we
01:15 - need to import PI input and then from PI
01:18 - input keyboard we're gonna import key
01:20 - and we're gonna input listener now
01:21 - listener is what's gonna listen for our
01:23 - key events so let's start by writing
01:25 - that so what we need to do is we're just
01:26 - going to say with and then listener then
01:30 - we're gonna have some brackets like this
01:31 - and we're gonna say on underscore press
01:33 - equals on underscore press just follow
01:37 - along with this for one second and then
01:38 - on underscore release is gonna equal on
01:41 - underscore release like that
01:44 - now these on press and on release are
01:47 - what we're gonna code in just a second
01:49 - and these are gonna be the functions
01:50 - that are called when a key is pressed
01:52 - and when a key is released feel free to
01:54 - change these names if you'd like to okay
01:56 - and we're just gonna say as now listener
01:59 - except this is gonna be lower case and
02:01 - then in this loop we're simply gonna do
02:03 - listener dot join okay and what this is
02:07 - going to do is just constantly keep
02:08 - running this loop until we break out of
02:10 - it and you'll see that in a second so
02:12 - now I need to create
02:13 - actions on press and on release so we're
02:16 - gonna do is we're going to say define on
02:17 - press this is going to take a key and it
02:21 - will just pass in here and then we're
02:22 - going to define on release same thing in
02:26 - here a key and we will pass now actually
02:30 - what we're gonna do on on press is we're
02:32 - just gonna print out the key just so we
02:33 - can see this working first of all and
02:35 - then we'll move into some other stuff so
02:37 - just gonna print and then this is a
02:39 - fancy way to print this key out you
02:40 - don't have to do it this way if you
02:41 - don't want to but we're just gonna dot
02:44 - format this with key so that it throws
02:49 - it in there like that okay so this is
02:51 - just simply gonna put key in our string
02:54 - okay so on release we're gonna add one
02:57 - bit of functionality just to make sure
02:58 - that we're able to break out of this
03:00 - loop and you will see that in one second
03:03 - so we're gonna say if key equals equals
03:07 - key dot and then ESC which stands for
03:11 - escape we're going to return false and
03:14 - all this is gonna do is break out of
03:16 - this loop if we hit the Escape key
03:17 - so now let's test our program and see if
03:20 - everything is working okay so we can see
03:22 - that we get the window up here and if I
03:24 - start typing some stuff you can see it
03:25 - says jsj SS and then it just tells me
03:28 - exactly what keys I hit now if I hit
03:30 - like the shift key or the caps lock key
03:32 - it'll tell me all those as well okay so
03:35 - now that we have that that's great but
03:37 - we want to actually do something
03:38 - meaningful with this so right now it's
03:40 - just giving us like a bunch of letters
03:41 - and these keys like this we want to save
03:44 - this into probably a text file or
03:46 - something that we're gonna be able to
03:47 - look at because most likely if you're
03:49 - creating a key logger you probably want
03:51 - to do something with the keys that are
03:53 - being pressed so what I'm gonna do is
03:55 - I'm gonna implement a few variables here
03:57 - and explain what they do in just a
03:58 - second so I'm just gonna start by saying
04:00 - count equals zero Keys equals a blank
04:04 - list and then inside of on press I'm
04:07 - gonna say global keys and count now I'm
04:11 - also gonna create another function here
04:12 - and this one is gonna be called write
04:14 - underscore file and what this is gonna
04:16 - do is exactly what it says it's going to
04:18 - write to a file so what we're gonna say
04:20 - is going to say with open and then a
04:23 - text file name whatever you want in this
04:24 - case mines log txt and then we're gonna
04:27 - put
04:28 - a mode here okay now if the first time
04:30 - you're running this you don't have a
04:31 - text file created and you're too lazy to
04:32 - make one cold for whatever you want to
04:34 - call it just put this as W because what
04:37 - W does is it means right and if that
04:39 - file does not exist it's simply going to
04:40 - create one so the first time you run it
04:43 - W works fine but after that you have to
04:45 - use a okay we're gonna do with open log
04:48 - dot txt it in a penned mode that's what
04:51 - that stands for as F and sorry this
04:54 - needs to take keys and all we're gonna
04:56 - do in here is we're gonna loop through
04:57 - all the keys and we're just gonna write
04:59 - them into the file so four key and keys
05:02 - and then we'll simply do F right key
05:06 - like that and this is going to write all
05:09 - of our keys into the file for us now you
05:11 - might ask well okay what's the point of
05:13 - this keys list and this count variable
05:15 - well the thing is if our user somehow
05:17 - able is able to break the program or
05:21 - like quit out of the program we want to
05:23 - make sure that we're not just writing
05:24 - this at the end because say for example
05:26 - the users on the computer for like an
05:27 - hour and they're typing stuff and we're
05:29 - storing all their keys in this key list
05:31 - and then all of a sudden they quit the
05:34 - program somehow without hitting the
05:35 - Escape key none of that is gonna be
05:37 - written to the text file so what this
05:38 - count variable is gonna allow us to do
05:40 - when I implement it in just a second is
05:41 - every so many keys we're going to update
05:44 - the text file so this way we're not
05:46 - constantly rewriting it every second but
05:48 - after the user hits a certain amount of
05:49 - keys then we're going to load that or
05:51 - write all that data into the text file
05:53 - so I guess I should probably add to our
05:57 - keys list if we're gonna be using that
05:58 - so whenever the user hits a key we're
06:00 - just gonna do keys dot append that key
06:03 - we're gonna add one to count so count
06:06 - plus equals count plus equals one like
06:08 - that and we can continue to print this
06:10 - if you want although it's not gonna be
06:11 - necessary because everything is gonna go
06:13 - in our log txt file now what I'm also
06:15 - going to do in fear is I'm just gonna
06:17 - throw a little if statement I'm gonna
06:18 - say if count is greater than or equal to
06:21 - and you can pick what number you want to
06:23 - do here I'm just gonna pick 10 so this
06:25 - means every 10 keys is how often we're
06:27 - gonna update the file now obviously if
06:29 - you think this can be running for a long
06:30 - time we I'm gonna make this longer or
06:32 - larger you could make it one you could
06:35 - not have the count variable if you want
06:36 - do whatever you want for this okay
06:38 - now I say we're gonna reset our counts
06:41 - equals zero we're going to write to our
06:43 - file passing it our keys list which is
06:46 - up here and it's gonna have stored all
06:47 - these keys and then we're just gonna
06:48 - reset keys and keys is gonna be equal to
06:51 - blank like this okay so that is I think
06:55 - at least should be working let's try
06:58 - this out oh wow the whole time I was
07:00 - typing that was recording my keys okay
07:02 - anyways let's see here if I start typing
07:06 - hello my name is oh and we get an issue
07:09 - right argument must be a string not key
07:11 - code I forgot about that so pretty much
07:14 - in here just getting mad at us because
07:15 - we don't have string so just throw
07:17 - string in there and then it should work
07:18 - okay let's try this again okay and hit
07:25 - escape and then we're gonna go in log
07:27 - txt okay and here we go so that was from
07:30 - previous runs and now look at this well
07:33 - it did what we wanted it to do it
07:34 - printed all the things into our text
07:36 - file but this is not meaningful
07:38 - information and we probably want it to
07:40 - look a little bit better than this and
07:41 - not have quotations and not have
07:43 - backspace keys so I'm gonna show you how
07:45 - we can do that right now so let's just
07:46 - clear this file save that and now let's
07:50 - deal with right file here so we're not
07:52 - writing these ridiculous characters into
07:54 - our text file so what I want to do is I
07:57 - want to write each word that the user
07:58 - types into one line so the way I'm gonna
08:01 - do that is every time the user hits the
08:03 - space key I'm going to add a new line to
08:06 - the file so first of all what I want to
08:08 - do is every time we're looping through
08:09 - keys I'm gonna say K is equal to STR key
08:14 - and I'm gonna say dot not remove replace
08:18 - and then quotation comma blank space now
08:22 - what this does is remove the quotation
08:24 - marks so if you remember int and here we
08:26 - had something that looked like actually
08:28 - what single quotation marks my bad like
08:31 - three like if you hit that that key
08:33 - would come up and go Taoiseach mark so
08:34 - this is just gonna remove that for us I
08:36 - don't know why it shows up in quotation
08:37 - marks but anyways so that's gonna turn
08:40 - it into a string replace the quotation
08:42 - marks now that we have it in a form that
08:44 - we can read properly we're first of all
08:46 - just going to check if this is a space
08:48 - character so if the user hit the
08:49 - spacebar so the way that we can do this
08:52 - we can say if kay
08:53 - don't find this is kind of the cheap way
08:57 - to do it but we're just going to do this
08:58 - dot spate a space in here equals equals
09:01 - we're actually is greater than zero so
09:05 - what this fine is gonna do is it's gonna
09:06 - look in the key because whenever we hit
09:08 - the space bar it does something like
09:10 - this does like key dot space okay that's
09:13 - what's returned does key so we're gonna
09:15 - look for space in our string we're gonna
09:18 - find that if it occurs more than one are
09:21 - more than zero times so once then we're
09:24 - going to write a space character to our
09:27 - line so in this case we're actually just
09:29 - gonna add a new line the way we add a
09:31 - new line in a file is just backslash n
09:32 - this just a notes like go to the next
09:34 - line okay all right after this we're
09:37 - also gonna check so if it's space that's
09:40 - fine but if it is any of the other keys
09:42 - like command shift backspace we don't
09:45 - want to write that into our file we
09:47 - don't want it to say like backspace or
09:48 - command so I'm just gonna say if and
09:51 - then when I say it say L if K dot find
09:54 - and then key equals equals negative one
09:59 - now what happens in find is if it
10:02 - doesn't find the string that you're
10:03 - looking for and I guess I better
10:06 - actually put a capital cakes I'm pretty
10:08 - sure it's capital then it returns us
10:09 - negative one value so if key does not
10:11 - exist meaning that we hit a key like QW
10:15 - like any of the letters of the number
10:16 - keys then we will simply write that into
10:18 - the file so we'll say F dot right and
10:20 - then whatever K was so that key okay and
10:24 - I will just show you this working now
10:26 - and then explain it really quickly so if
10:28 - we run this I start typing hello my name
10:32 - is and I'll backspace a few times space
10:35 - add some stuff okay and get rid all of
10:38 - that and close the file or close the
10:42 - program sorry you can see we get why
10:44 - hello my name is space space space space
10:47 - space space hello and then we get a
10:49 - bunch more spaces and that is because
10:51 - whenever you hit the space key right
10:53 - it's adding a new line so we could now
10:56 - check if the line before that is blank
10:59 - then let's not continue to do that or
11:01 - whatever like stuff like that and you
11:02 - can continue and checking all these
11:04 - different keys and seeing what they are
11:06 - but this is all I'm gonna show you for
11:08 - right now knowing this you have a basis
11:10 - for how to get keys how to store them in
11:12 - a text file and you guys can play around
11:14 - with creating a better key logger I
11:16 - don't to make this video too long so
11:18 - that's all I'm going to show you today
11:19 - if this helped you out please make sure
11:20 - you leave a like and subscribe and I'll
11:22 - see you again in another tutorial

for more videos like this feel free to check out my website tech with Tim net and subscribe to my channel tech with them in this video I'm going to be showing you how to log user key presses and save those key presses in a meaningful way in a text file now the module that we're going to be using for this is PI input you can see right here this is what it's called it is a third party module not included with the default installation of Python which means our first step in this video is going to be installing PI input so what we need to do is obviously we have to go to our command prompt because rich can use pip to do this pretty straightforward bring up your command prompt simply type pip install and then PI and input okay so just forget the I there wait for that to run and once I goes through you should have PI input installed for some reason your pip is not working reinstall Python and when you reinstall python make sure you add or check the box that says add python to path and install pip okay and that should fix your issue if you're having any other problems leave a comment down below okay so we're first what we need to do is we're gonna set up a we need to actually bring these imports in so we need to import PI input and then from PI input keyboard we're gonna import key and we're gonna input listener now listener is what's gonna listen for our key events so let's start by writing that so what we need to do is we're just going to say with and then listener then we're gonna have some brackets like this and we're gonna say on underscore press equals on underscore press just follow along with this for one second and then on underscore release is gonna equal on underscore release like that now these on press and on release are what we're gonna code in just a second and these are gonna be the functions that are called when a key is pressed and when a key is released feel free to change these names if you'd like to okay and we're just gonna say as now listener except this is gonna be lower case and then in this loop we're simply gonna do listener dot join okay and what this is going to do is just constantly keep running this loop until we break out of it and you'll see that in a second so now I need to create actions on press and on release so we're gonna do is we're going to say define on press this is going to take a key and it will just pass in here and then we're going to define on release same thing in here a key and we will pass now actually what we're gonna do on on press is we're just gonna print out the key just so we can see this working first of all and then we'll move into some other stuff so just gonna print and then this is a fancy way to print this key out you don't have to do it this way if you don't want to but we're just gonna dot format this with key so that it throws it in there like that okay so this is just simply gonna put key in our string okay so on release we're gonna add one bit of functionality just to make sure that we're able to break out of this loop and you will see that in one second so we're gonna say if key equals equals key dot and then ESC which stands for escape we're going to return false and all this is gonna do is break out of this loop if we hit the Escape key so now let's test our program and see if everything is working okay so we can see that we get the window up here and if I start typing some stuff you can see it says jsj SS and then it just tells me exactly what keys I hit now if I hit like the shift key or the caps lock key it'll tell me all those as well okay so now that we have that that's great but we want to actually do something meaningful with this so right now it's just giving us like a bunch of letters and these keys like this we want to save

now if the first time you're running this you don't have a text file created and you're too lazy to make one cold for whatever you want to call it just put this as W because what W does is it means right and if that file does not exist it's simply going to create one so the first time you run it W works fine but after that you have to use a okay we're gonna do with open log dot txt it in a penned mode that's what that stands for as F and sorry this needs to take keys and all we're gonna do in here is we're gonna loop through all the keys and we're just gonna write them into the file so four key and keys and then we'll simply do F right key like that and this is going to write all of our keys into the file for us now you might ask well okay what's the point of this keys list and this count variable well the thing is if our user somehow able is able to break the program or like quit out of the program we want to make sure that we're not just writing this at the end because say for

you want do whatever you want for this okay now I say we're gonna reset our counts equals zero we're going to write to our file passing it our keys list which is up here and it's gonna have stored all these keys and then we're just gonna reset keys and keys is gonna be equal to blank like this okay so that is I think at least should be working let's try this out oh wow the whole time I was typing

after this we're also gonna check so if it's space that's fine but if it is any of the other keys like command shift backspace we don't want to write that into our file we don't want it to say like backspace or command so I'm just gonna say if and then when I say it say L if K dot find and then key equals equals negative one now what happens in find is if it doesn't find the string that you're looking for and I guess I better actually put a capital cakes I'm pretty sure it's capital then it returns us negative one value so if key does not exist meaning that we hit a key like QW like any of the letters of the number keys then we will simply write that into the file so we'll say F dot right and then whatever K was so that key okay and I will just show you this working now and then explain it really quickly so if we run this I start typing hello my name is and I'll backspace a few times space add some stuff okay and get rid all of that and close the file or close the program sorry you
