00:00 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
00:01 - and welcome to another cloud
00:03 - certification and this time it's oracle
00:06 - foundation's associate certification it
00:08 - is the entry-level certification for the
00:11 - oracle cloud infrastructure platform uh
00:13 - and i'm going to show you in less than a
00:15 - week how to pass this certification
00:17 - and if you are new to cloud it's a
00:19 - really great one to
00:21 - do and i have some really great follow
00:23 - alongs for you that's going to show you
00:25 - how to set up your account how to launch
00:26 - an instance and database
00:27 - and just generally understand uh the
00:29 - reasons why you'd want to use cloud so
00:32 - uh you know i hope you enjoy this course
00:34 - please do the follow alongs it's gonna
00:35 - really help you pass uh and i'd love to
00:38 - hear uh your feedback and if you do pass
00:40 - definitely share that with me because i
00:42 - love to hear that you're passing these
00:44 - courses and i'll see you soon
00:48 - [Music]
00:53 - so i want to do a quick comparison
00:54 - between the oci foundations and the aws
00:57 - certified cloud practitioner
00:58 - certification both these uh
01:00 - certifications are foundational so they
01:02 - are the first certification you would
01:04 - take if you're starting out on cloud
01:06 - um but let's get into it and the first
01:08 - thing is that the oca foundation
01:10 - certification is only valid for 1.5
01:12 - years and that is a very short period of
01:15 - time
01:16 - the
01:17 - aws certifications are generally two
01:19 - years but as of recent the ccp is now
01:21 - valid for three years and so why oracle
01:24 - did this i do not know but i
01:26 - i guess that the reason they might have
01:28 - done this is that because their platform
01:29 - is so new they're anticipating that
01:31 - their platform is going to rapidly
01:33 - change in the next couple of years and
01:35 - they don't want to have a bunch of
01:36 - certification holders
01:38 - who claim to know how to use their
01:39 - platform when the platform is so
01:41 - different so maybe uh the next time in
01:44 - the
01:45 - next two years we'll see um they'll have
01:47 - new versions of their certifications and
01:49 - they'll be valid for a longer period of
01:51 - time but right now it's a very short
01:52 - period of time and i do not like that
01:54 - one thing i want to point out is that
01:56 - the oci foundation certification is five
01:58 - dollars cheaper than the ccp
02:00 - that is a
02:02 - very minute difference but it might
02:03 - matter to you if you're on a budget
02:06 - if you are going for multiple
02:07 - certifications beyond the foundational
02:09 - cert um one thing i really like that aws
02:11 - does is they give you half off the next
02:13 - certification so if you sat the ccp
02:16 - which is a hundred dollars and you go
02:18 - for an associate which is generally 150
02:20 - it's now just 75 dollars so you're
02:22 - spending 175 dollars for two
02:24 - certifications oracle does not have such
02:26 - a deal right now um if if you're
02:28 - listening oracle i strongly recommend
02:30 - that you uh adopt this because it's very
02:32 - very cool
02:34 - um but right now they do not have it so
02:36 - you're going to get a better deal on the
02:38 - side with aws
02:40 - if you've ever taken the az 900 or the
02:42 - aws ccp and you're wondering whether you
02:44 - should go take the oracle foundations
02:46 - i'm going to tell you that the knowledge
02:48 - transfer is extremely good
02:50 - if you were to pull up all three of
02:52 - these certifications on the screen right
02:54 - now uh like the exam guides you notice
02:56 - that their their outlines are extremely
02:58 - similar so the only difference is that
03:01 - the names of the services are different
03:03 - and there's some differences in billing
03:04 - so if you already have that ccp and you
03:07 - want to add another certification to
03:10 - your roster certifications and you have
03:12 - the money i do strongly go recommend and
03:14 - get the oracle foundations
03:16 - one thing i don't like about their exam
03:18 - is that it doesn't have weighted domains
03:20 - and i'll we'll talk about this in an
03:22 - upcoming slide but the problem with that
03:24 - is that if they're not weighted that
03:26 - means that the exam isn't going to be as
03:27 - balanced as it could be and so it'll be
03:30 - harder not because it's technically
03:31 - difficult but because the the balancing
03:34 - is off so hopefully they will solve this
03:36 - in the future
03:37 - this is a pro or con depending on the
03:39 - way you look at it but they are a very
03:40 - young cloud provider so they don't have
03:42 - as much stuff as aws but that's also
03:45 - advantage if you're new to cloud so if
03:47 - you find aws extremely overwhelming
03:50 - and you want to
03:51 - have a work on a simpler platform you
03:54 - can
03:55 - dig into oracle and grow with the
03:57 - platform as they add more additional
03:59 - services
04:01 - and the last thing or not the last thing
04:04 - but i want to point out that their
04:05 - documentation is very fragmented this
04:06 - was very hard for me to put this course
04:08 - together because there was conflicting
04:10 - information or just i had to fill in the
04:12 - blanks for you here
04:14 - uh and i think i did take the best
04:16 - guests here but that is one thing that i
04:19 - wish they would improve upon
04:21 - and the last thing and this is the most
04:23 - important thing is that there is a lack
04:25 - of oracle certification holders
04:27 - and oracle is a very old company they've
04:30 - been around since the 70s and there's a
04:32 - lot of companies using oracle so if you
04:34 - do get oracle certifications i
04:35 - definitely believe there are jobs out
04:37 - there where
04:38 - having these certs are going to matter
04:41 - i do consider it a smaller market than
04:43 - the adabus certifications
04:45 - but if you are looking to stand out
04:47 - then this is a great certification to
04:50 - get so there you go
04:52 - [Music]
04:57 - so let's take a look here at the exam
04:59 - guide and this is the outline of what's
05:02 - actually going to be required of us to
05:04 - pass the exam and then after we go
05:06 - through the highlights here we'll
05:08 - actually open up the actual exam guide
05:09 - and i'll show you uh where you can find
05:11 - that information so the first thing is
05:13 - the domains and so the domains are cloud
05:15 - concepts osa infrastructure osec core
05:17 - services security billing and pricing
05:20 - but one thing you're going to notice is
05:22 - that there are there is no domain
05:23 - waiting on this exam so these domains uh
05:26 - we don't know if the exam is comprised
05:28 - of 40 of the questions of security 10
05:31 - percent if these are all evenly
05:32 - distributed we just don't have that
05:34 - information and so that is one of the
05:36 - downsides of oracle certifications i
05:38 - think maybe in the future they might
05:40 - tell us but at this
05:42 - time i could not figure out how the uh
05:45 - how the questions are distributed
05:47 - but that's just what it is
05:49 - to pass this exam you're going to have
05:50 - to get a 68
05:52 - i don't know if oracle
05:54 - i do know things about oracle but i
05:55 - don't know if they uh they do it at
05:57 - based on like a point system so on a bus
06:00 - it's like a thousand out of whatever um
06:02 - so you know you'd have to get 680 points
06:04 - to score out of a thousand
06:06 - but anyway we know the passing grade is
06:08 - 68
06:10 - there are 60 questions on the exam uh
06:13 - and so you can afford to get 19
06:14 - questions wrong all the questions are
06:16 - multiple choice there's no uh no
06:19 - questions where you have to multi-select
06:21 - any boxes
06:22 - so that's a little bit nice
06:24 - all right well it turns out i was
06:25 - actually wrong it does have multiple
06:27 - choice and multiple answers i just
06:29 - wanted to quickly correct that there and
06:32 - we'll go back to the video so yeah
06:33 - you're going to get a combination of
06:35 - both and you could see
06:37 - multiple answers where they might be
06:38 - asking you between two and three choices
06:41 - to choose from and then multiple choice
06:42 - would be just one out of the four um but
06:45 - there you go
06:47 - uh you have 105 minutes to take this
06:49 - exam so that means you're going to
06:51 - roughly have two minutes per questions
06:53 - uh it's going to be less than two
06:55 - minutes but you're going to have a lot
06:56 - of time to uh pass this exam and i
06:59 - strongly recom you're going to
07:00 - definitely have time left over and i
07:02 - strongly recommend that you go back and
07:03 - review all your questions and make sure
07:05 - that you made the the correct choices
07:07 - because sometimes when you're studying
07:08 - you're just in a hurry to get to the end
07:10 - so you don't run out on the clock and
07:12 - you should really go and take a second
07:14 - look at your questions
07:16 - and the last thing is that this exam is
07:18 - only valid for 18 months so once you get
07:20 - the certification you do have to get
07:21 - recertified in 1.5 years and i did say
07:24 - earlier that i i found that a strong
07:26 - disadvantage for oracle certifications
07:29 - and maybe that will change in the future
07:30 - but that's just how it is right now um
07:33 - but there you go and we'll go jump into
07:35 - the actual doc the actual pdfs now
07:40 - so here i have the exam guide opened in
07:42 - front of us here so we can get a bit
07:43 - better details of what the domains are
07:46 - one thing i couldn't easily find was how
07:48 - long the certification was valid for the
07:51 - way i found it was there was another
07:52 - marketing page and from this page there
07:54 - was this link and in this link it told
07:56 - us it was valid for 18 months and that's
07:58 - how i found out you have to get your
07:59 - certificate recertified in 1.5 years why
08:02 - it's not in this documentation i have no
08:04 - idea or i might have just not noticed it
08:07 - but i just wanted to point that out if
08:09 - you're trying to validate what i'm
08:10 - saying about the um
08:12 - how long the certification is valid for
08:15 - so let's hop over to
08:17 - the certification details here and just
08:18 - give it a quick zoom in here
08:21 - and you're going to notice
08:22 - that the exam number or for this exam is
08:26 - 170 1085 hyphen 20. i do not know why
08:30 - they named it that because it's very
08:31 - complicated
08:33 - maybe they have a lot of other exams
08:34 - we're not aware of but that is the name
08:36 - of your exam number it's very important
08:38 - to know your exam number because
08:40 - if there are future exams you need to
08:42 - know which one you are taking
08:44 - because the content might be different
08:46 - here they say the target audience is
08:48 - designed for technical and non-technical
08:49 - professionals involved in selling and
08:51 - purchasing oci infrastructure which i
08:53 - definitely agree with um to take this
08:56 - exam you can take it via pearson vue so
08:58 - that is the partnered um data set
09:01 - or test center network so there's a few
09:04 - different tests test center networks and
09:06 - pearson view is a very well-known one
09:09 - for their proctored exams proctored
09:10 - meaning that you can take the exams
09:12 - online so you can take this in a test
09:14 - center and that is the preferred way
09:16 - that's the way i suggest you to take
09:19 - your exams or you can take it online
09:21 - where they connect via webcam and they
09:23 - make sure that you uh you aren't
09:25 - cheating and then you just take it from
09:27 - the comfort of your own home
09:28 - we can see that's
09:30 - 105 minutes we have 95 for the exam cost
09:34 - and it looks like it says 25
09:36 - percent discount on the list price if
09:38 - you are an opn so part of the oracle
09:40 - partner network you are likely not part
09:43 - of the oracle partner network if it's
09:44 - anything like the amazon partner network
09:46 - uh you have to
09:48 - do a lot of work to join that but if you
09:50 - are working for company and they have
09:52 - this then you can save a bit of money
09:53 - and the passing score here is 68
09:55 - again it doesn't tell us the points it
09:57 - doesn't say 680 points it doesn't tell
09:59 - us the breakdown of the
10:00 - uh the scoring but we'll take a look
10:03 - here and maybe i'm wrong but i'm pretty
10:04 - sure it does not
10:08 - then we have some stuff about
10:09 - certification benefits
10:10 - nothing super exciting here but this is
10:12 - what the badge looks like so once you
10:14 - pass the exam you can download this
10:16 - digital badge and you're going to want
10:18 - to
10:19 - you could put this on your website but
10:20 - the huge advantage is you wanted to have
10:22 - that certificate and put in your
10:23 - linkedin so everyone can see it
10:25 - that's the the main goal of getting
10:27 - certifications is putting them on your
10:29 - linkedin
10:30 - and so we'll just scroll down a little
10:31 - bit and now we'll get to the actual um
10:34 - exam topics or i like to call them
10:36 - domains because most other providers
10:38 - call them domain so the first one is
10:40 - cloud concepts so and understand terms
10:42 - like scalable elastic agility fault
10:45 - tolerance capex opex understand the
10:47 - difference between
10:50 - iass pass and sas understand public
10:53 - private hybrid models reduce tco with
10:56 - migrations on-prem cloud without
10:58 - re-architecting then you have the
11:00 - getting started with oracle
11:01 - infrastructure so describe the key
11:03 - features
11:04 - components of oci so multi-ad 1ad 80
11:07 - fault domains console apis
11:10 - clis and sdks
11:13 - i don't think we cover these two things
11:14 - but there's not much to talk about so i
11:16 - don't know why they have it there
11:17 - because i did not see it on the exam
11:20 - oracle cloud infrastructure services so
11:22 - understand the core services i am
11:24 - compute network storage databases
11:26 - understand cloud native services okay
11:28 - ocr
11:30 - ffn streaming api gateway
11:33 - um so that's kind of interesting then
11:35 - you have security compliance so oci
11:37 - security services so vcn sl
11:40 - nsg waff etc etc
11:42 - pricing support and operations so oca
11:45 - pricing model understand oci
11:47 - subscription models pricing calculator
11:48 - free tier the oci sla oci operations oci
11:53 - concepts like budgets quota limits and
11:55 - support
11:56 - so that is the breakdown of information
11:58 - that we need to learn and that we're
12:00 - going to cover that all in the exam
12:02 - what's surprising is that they don't
12:03 - have any white paper so with aws they
12:06 - usually have technical white papers they
12:08 - want you to read
12:09 - oracle actually does have white papers
12:11 - but it doesn't appear to be part of
12:13 - their exam
12:14 - just yet so maybe they'll do that in the
12:16 - future
12:17 - there's some information about like exam
12:19 - score if we pop over here
12:22 - doesn't really tell us much about how
12:23 - the scoring works it's just saying that
12:25 - you'll get the score with pearson vue
12:27 - after the fact
12:29 - and there's just some other information
12:30 - so hopefully that helps you better
12:32 - understand the breakdown exam and now we
12:34 - can jump into
12:36 - uh the actual content itself and start
12:38 - learning oracle
12:39 - so uh with on-prem or on-premise uh you
12:43 - own the servers you hire the it people
12:46 - you pay the rent or real estate and you
12:48 - take all the risk but with using uh the
12:50 - cloud someone else owns the servers
12:53 - someone else hires the i.t people
12:55 - someone else pays
12:57 - pays or rents the real estate and all
13:00 - you're left to do is uh with the
13:02 - responsibility of configuring your cloud
13:04 - services and code and everything else is
13:06 - taken care by the cloud provider so it
13:08 - sounds pretty good to start with
13:12 - so to really understand cloud computing
13:14 - let's look at the evolution of servers
13:16 - to see how we got to cloud so if we go
13:19 - back to the 90s if you wanted a server
13:21 - you'd have to get a dedicated server and
13:23 - what that means is you'd have to go out
13:25 - buy a physical machine or all the
13:28 - components for it assemble that machine
13:29 - hire the it staff
13:31 - install the operating system and it was
13:33 - really designed only to run a single web
13:35 - app or website and so this was very
13:38 - expensive it was very high maintenance
13:40 - so if you wanted to run a web app you
13:42 - had to have a lot of money so it wasn't
13:44 - accessible to everybody and then as time
13:47 - progressed we figured out how to
13:48 - virtualize servers that means we were
13:50 - able to um place a virtual uh machine
13:53 - within a machine so you'd still buy a
13:55 - physical server
13:57 - but we had this other layer where we
13:59 - could actually run four websites or web
14:01 - apps on a single machine as opposed to
14:03 - buying four machines so the machine was
14:06 - better utilized uh and so that was a a a
14:10 - great advantage in um
14:12 - server technology
14:14 - then came along shared hosting so maybe
14:16 - the early 2000s the idea is that you had
14:18 - this one physical machine
14:20 - but instead of you having to buy that
14:23 - machine yourself which was really
14:24 - expensive you could share the cost with
14:26 - hundreds of other businesses
14:28 - and the way you're isolated uh from
14:30 - other um
14:32 - businesses is that uh you would wouldn't
14:34 - be necessarily in your own virtual
14:35 - machine but you'd have your own account
14:37 - on that machine uh and so you're really
14:39 - relying on other
14:42 - tenants so clients under utilizing the
14:44 - resources the only disadvantage of
14:46 - shared hosting is that if you have a
14:48 - particular client who overuses the
14:50 - machine everybody suffers because um
14:53 - that person is overusing the the the
14:55 - resources but generally most of the time
14:58 - it's very cheap but there are some
15:00 - serious limitations and then along came
15:02 - cloud and so what cloud did was instead
15:04 - of using a single machine you're able to
15:06 - use multiple physical machines that act
15:08 - as one system so the system abstracted
15:11 - uh the systems inspected away and we
15:12 - just called them cloud services and so
15:14 - the advantage here is that you get that
15:16 - virtual isolization uh which you have
15:18 - with virtual machines uh but you also
15:21 - get to save a lot of money because
15:23 - you're sharing the cost with a lot of
15:24 - other people um and and you get all
15:27 - these other advantages so with cloud
15:29 - hosting it's flexible scalable secure
15:30 - cost effective and high highly
15:32 - configurable if this isn't clear right
15:34 - now it will be uh later uh later on
15:37 - because i'm definitely going to really
15:39 - uh make the differences very clear here
15:42 - and all these models are still used so
15:44 - people still use dedicated servers
15:46 - virtual private servers shared hosting
15:48 - and cloud hosting it's just based on
15:50 - your use case but there's a lot we can
15:52 - do with cloud
15:55 - [Music]
15:59 - so let's take a quick look at what
16:00 - oracle is you may have seen their logo
16:02 - before if you've worked in enterprise or
16:04 - you've been working in tech for a very
16:05 - long time because they are a very
16:07 - well-known company
16:08 - they are an american multinational
16:10 - computer technology corporation
16:12 - headquartered in redwood shores
16:13 - california
16:15 - they are the second largest software
16:16 - company by revenue and market
16:18 - capitalization
16:19 - that is a quote from wikipedia so i
16:22 - believe that it may be true
16:24 - and they have been around since the late
16:26 - 1970s and that explains why they're in
16:28 - redwood shores california because a lot
16:30 - of tech companies established themselves
16:33 - there i think microsoft did as well and
16:35 - they're uh best known for their
16:38 - databases so it's always a surprise when
16:40 - people say oh they're cloud provider i
16:42 - thought they only did databases they do
16:43 - other things
16:45 - and one database you might know is the
16:46 - mysql database so oracle has their own
16:49 - database called oracle but they also
16:51 - have mysql i don't believe they
16:53 - originally made it i think they bought
16:54 - it
16:55 - and it's an open source database but um
16:57 - those are two very popular databases so
17:00 - then the question is is what is oracle
17:02 - cloud infrastructure and that is what
17:04 - oracle calls their cloud service
17:06 - provider so with aws
17:08 - um that is so you have amazon and so
17:11 - amazon's is called amazon web service
17:12 - for google it's called google cloud
17:15 - uh provider
17:17 - and so oracle calls there's oracle cloud
17:18 - infrastructure so that's just what it is
17:21 - and so we can generally refer to it as
17:23 - oracle cloud infrastructure
17:26 - so oci or oracle cloud so when i say
17:29 - either of these or all three of these
17:31 - these are all the same thing just so you
17:33 - don't get confused and that is what
17:35 - we're focused on for the certification
17:37 - learning the oracle cloud infrastructure
17:40 - [Music]
17:45 - let's talk about the advantages of cloud
17:46 - computing and the first thing is on
17:48 - demand so you only pay for the resources
17:50 - that you consume there's no upfront cost
17:52 - with cloud computing you generally pay
17:54 - by the hour or by uh the minute or
17:57 - second depending on the service so you
17:58 - don't have to buy a server out right or
18:01 - or necessarily commit to uh like a like
18:04 - a one year three year or five year
18:06 - contract so there's a lot more
18:08 - flexibility there
18:10 - if you want to start doing business
18:12 - anywhere in the world you can because
18:14 - with cloud computing you can launch your
18:15 - workloads anywhere if you want to launch
18:17 - servers in tokyo frankfurt
18:20 - or canada you can just do that
18:22 - there is no extra work
18:24 - in order to
18:25 - start doing that
18:27 - the cost is a lot cheaper because you're
18:29 - sharing the cost with thousands of other
18:30 - customers
18:31 - all those computers have been uh treated
18:34 - like a single computer so
18:36 - the idea is that you are really saving a
18:39 - lot of money because there's so many
18:41 - people on the platform but you're still
18:42 - secure because you're all virtually
18:44 - isolated from each other
18:45 - you no longer have to do a lot of
18:47 - upfront work to launch a server or set
18:49 - up infrastructure so if this was on prem
18:51 - you would have to decide okay we're
18:53 - going to have this kind of networking
18:55 - and these kind of servers and we're
18:57 - going to hire these kind of people and
18:59 - so you have to really plan for your
19:00 - project in the old way but with cloud
19:02 - you can just start launching resources
19:04 - experiment and as you experiment you
19:06 - have detailed monitoring on a lot of
19:08 - those services and so that's going to
19:10 - make it a lot easier for you to figure
19:11 - out exactly what you need and you don't
19:13 - really have to guess
19:15 - um if you uh are launching a physical
19:18 - server like if you're doing on-prem you
19:20 - might and you're expecting you're going
19:22 - to have a lot of growth you might end up
19:24 - having to buy a bunch of servers
19:26 - that are not being utilized because you
19:28 - haven't met that capacity yet but the
19:30 - cloud it's elastic so you can add or
19:33 - remove servers uh when need be so you're
19:35 - only paying for the actual uh capacity
19:38 - that you need so that's really nice and
19:40 - the last thing is that
19:42 - it's really really fast to market so
19:44 - with a few clicks you're going to be
19:46 - able to set up a bunch of infrastructure
19:48 - where if you're doing this on your own
19:50 - it could take weeks or months if you had
19:53 - to do it in your own on-premise or data
19:55 - center so hopefully
19:56 - that points out what are the advantages
19:58 - of cloud computing
20:00 - [Music]
20:04 - so let's take a look at the types of
20:06 - cloud computing and starting at the top
20:07 - of our pyramid and i promise you this is
20:09 - not a pyramid scheme it is just a great
20:12 - way of doing this visualization at the
20:14 - top we have a software as a service also
20:16 - known as sas this is a product that is
20:18 - run and managed by a service provider
20:20 - you do not worry about how the service
20:22 - is maintained it just works and remains
20:23 - available
20:25 - examples of sasses would be salesforce
20:27 - gmail and office 365
20:30 - and this is for customers so
20:32 - you probably used a sas product and you
20:34 - just don't know it
20:36 - is the most common type of
20:38 - cloud computing so you've been using
20:40 - cloud all along then the next level down
20:42 - is platform as a service which is paas
20:45 - or maybe people would say pass but i've
20:47 - never heard anyone say it like that and
20:49 - this focuses on the deployment and
20:50 - management of your apps so you don't
20:52 - worry about provisioning configuring or
20:53 - understanding the hardware os to launch
20:55 - your applica your web applications so
20:58 - this for aws this could be elastic bean
20:59 - stock
21:01 - there's also heroku which is a very
21:02 - popular provider among junior developers
21:05 - and then you have google google app
21:07 - engine and this is really suited for
21:09 - developers it just makes development a
21:11 - lot easier without you having to worry
21:12 - about setting up your servers and then
21:14 - at the bottom we have infrastructure as
21:16 - a service
21:18 - and so this is the basic building blocks
21:20 - for cloud it provides access to network
21:22 - features computers data storage space
21:25 - you do not worry about the i.t staff the
21:26 - data centers or hardware and this is
21:29 - really what we are interested in uh so
21:32 - examples could be microsoft azure aws
21:36 - and oracle cloud and this is really
21:39 - intended for admins or being able to do
21:41 - anything and everything that you want um
21:44 - so when we look at oracle cloud it is an
21:46 - iaas or ice i don't know how to say that
21:50 - but you it also has platform as a
21:52 - service and software as a service so
21:54 - when you look at that pyramid you have
21:55 - to understand that infrastructure
21:57 - service the bottom encompasses
21:59 - everything
22:00 - so you know hopefully that makes sense
22:02 - but yeah that's the types of cloud
22:04 - computing
22:05 - [Music]
22:09 - so let's talk about cloud deployment
22:10 - models here very quickly so the first is
22:12 - cloud native and this is where
22:14 - everything is built on the cloud
22:16 - so here's an example of an architectural
22:18 - diagram what it does is it takes an
22:20 - image you upload to the cloud and then
22:22 - what it does is it turns it into a
22:23 - thumbnail and it gives it back to you
22:25 - but the point i want to get across here
22:28 - is that when we're talking about using
22:30 - the
22:31 - cloud as a deployment model that means
22:33 - that we're 100 using the cloud then you
22:36 - have hybrid architectures also just
22:38 - known as hybrid that's where you use
22:39 - on-prem and the cloud again on-prem
22:41 - would mean like your own local data
22:43 - center and then cloud would be the cloud
22:46 - provider and so what you could have here
22:48 - is you could have on the left-hand side
22:50 - this is the cloud network and then you
22:52 - have the on-premise network and they're
22:53 - being joined together to do work
22:55 - together so just because
22:57 - um you're utilizing cloud doesn't mean
22:59 - you have to get rid of your your uh your
23:01 - local data center or your on-premise
23:03 - data center you can use both and it's
23:05 - very common with large enterprises
23:06 - because there are definitely reasons to
23:08 - keep on-prem around for uh security
23:11 - regulations and or just because you've
23:13 - had a data center for so long it's just
23:14 - too hard to move everything over to
23:16 - cloud then you have cross-cloud this is
23:18 - where you're using multiple cloud
23:20 - providers
23:21 - some people might call this multi-cloud
23:22 - or hybrid cloud and so this is an
23:24 - example where we have
23:26 - aws on the left gcp on the right and we
23:28 - have azure connecting them together for
23:31 - the actual exam
23:33 - most cloud providers do not like
23:35 - mentioning cross cloud because they
23:36 - really want you to focus on uh their
23:39 - cloud platform some are more friendly
23:41 - than others for oracle
23:43 - they they're very
23:46 - collaborative with
23:47 - azure or microsoft so you'll see a lot
23:50 - of stuff
23:52 - cross cloud with those two providers
23:53 - oracle and microsoft and then microsoft
23:56 - tries to connect to everything
23:58 - but yeah those are the three deployment
23:59 - models but for the exam it's probably
24:01 - going to be like cloud hybrid and
24:02 - on-prem
24:03 - i just list that last one there for your
24:05 - own benefit
24:06 - [Music]
24:10 - so let's talk about cloud architectural
24:12 - terminologies which is very important
24:14 - about the cloud
24:16 - so the first term i want you know is
24:17 - called availability and this is the
24:18 - ability for a service and when i say
24:20 - service i mean web application um
24:24 - to remain available
24:26 - and if we had an application that was
24:28 - very very available we would call that
24:30 - high availability ha and that is a term
24:32 - you definitely need to know
24:34 - and don't worry we're just going through
24:35 - a quick list here and then we're going
24:36 - to actually look at them all in more
24:37 - granular detail but i'm just going to
24:39 - quickly go through all these terms this
24:41 - next one is scalability so this is the
24:42 - ability to grow
24:44 - rapidly
24:45 - or grow where you're unimpeded
24:48 - so that is scalability then you have
24:51 - elasticity elasticity this is the
24:53 - ability to shrink or grow to meet the
24:56 - current demand
24:57 - then you have fault tolerances the
24:59 - ability to prevent a failure then you
25:01 - have disaster recovery this is the
25:02 - ability to recover from a failure and we
25:05 - usually call this uh being highly
25:07 - durable so it's abbreviated to dr
25:10 - i'm sure these other ones have
25:11 - abbreviations but generally the only two
25:13 - that people know is ha and dr so this is
25:16 - the two ones i want to emphasize
25:18 - [Music]
25:22 - so let's take a look first at high
25:24 - availability and this is your ability
25:26 - for your service to remain available by
25:28 - ensuring there is no single point of
25:30 - failure and or ensure a certain level of
25:33 - performance now i put no single point of
25:35 - failure because some of these
25:37 - terminologies kind of overlap in terms
25:38 - of responsibilities and so single point
25:41 - failure is really for uh responsibly for
25:43 - another one but you know i do highlight
25:45 - it here uh just to make the example bit
25:48 - easier so an example of having high
25:50 - ability is imagine you have a server
25:53 - and uh if you only had a single server
25:55 - and for whatever reason if the um data
25:58 - center became unavailable
26:00 - like let's say there was a outage um or
26:04 - a network outage or some sort or natural
26:06 - disaster then your website would not be
26:09 - accessible anymore so in order to make
26:11 - it highly available what we need to do
26:13 - is we need to run our server
26:15 - in more than one data center and so
26:17 - that's what you're seeing in that graph
26:19 - where you see 81 82 83 we have three
26:22 - servers running in three data centers
26:24 - and then we are
26:26 - sending all the traffic to all of them
26:28 - and actually running your your um
26:31 - your uh your your service in more than
26:34 - one data center and in fact three in
26:36 - three different data centers is a very
26:38 - very common practice uh is is generally
26:41 - a minimum requirement for a lot of
26:42 - enterprise companies because if one data
26:45 - center was to go out um then you need to
26:47 - have another redundant data center
26:50 - that that has your service running but
26:52 - if two went out and that's very unlikely
26:55 - but it's totally possible that's why you
26:56 - need a third one so three is the magic
26:58 - number and you need to definitely
27:00 - remember that
27:01 - but what is the mechanism that allows us
27:03 - to um distribute traffic to all these
27:06 - three uh different data centers where we
27:08 - have servers in each one and that's
27:10 - called a load balancer and so every
27:12 - cloud provider has a load bouncer and i
27:14 - believe oracle's is called the oracle
27:15 - load bouncer and so a load bouncer
27:17 - allows you to evenly distribute traffic
27:19 - to multiple servers in one or more more
27:22 - multiple data centers if a data center
27:24 - or a server becomes unavailable and so
27:26 - we could say that that means that it's
27:28 - unhealthy the load bouncer would route
27:30 - traffic to only healthy data centers and
27:32 - servers so again the thing here this red
27:35 - thing that's the load bouncer that's the
27:37 - internet from the internet we have
27:38 - traffic coming in and then it's going to
27:40 - evenly distribute to all those servers
27:42 - so that is high availability
27:45 - [Music]
27:49 - so the next cloud architecture
27:51 - terminology we want to talk about is
27:53 - high
27:53 - scalability so this is your ability to
27:56 - increase your capacity based on the
27:57 - increasing demand of traffic memory and
28:00 - computing power so imagine you have a
28:02 - server and the server is not powerful
28:04 - enough to run your service so what would
28:06 - you do the first thing most people would
28:08 - do is they'd buy a bigger server and
28:10 - this is called vertical scaling or
28:11 - scaling up because you are uh you're
28:13 - using the same machine and you are
28:15 - making it bigger so that is what
28:17 - vertical scaling is another way to scale
28:20 - is called horizontal scaling and this is
28:22 - where you scale out so you're adding
28:25 - more servers of the same size
28:27 - so that's vertical scaling and
28:29 - horizontal scaling you need to know
28:30 - scaling up and scaling out
28:32 - but that is the general concept of high
28:35 - scalability
28:37 - [Music]
28:42 - so now let's take a look at high
28:43 - elasticity so this is your ability to
28:46 - automatically increase or decrease your
28:48 - capacity based on the current demand of
28:50 - traffic memory and computing power it
28:52 - sounds a lot like the last one but
28:53 - there's one key difference and that is
28:55 - that you can add or remove servers add
28:58 - or remove based on the current demand of
29:00 - traffic and so the only way we're going
29:02 - to be able to do this is with horizontal
29:04 - scaling but when we are adding more
29:06 - servers
29:07 - we call that scaling out
29:09 - and we're removing servers because the
29:11 - traffic is it has reduced in size
29:14 - that is called scaling in and so you
29:16 - generally won't hear the term vertical
29:18 - scaling with high elasticity because
29:20 - generally it's very hard
29:22 - for traditional architectures to um to
29:26 - to scale elastically it's very hard to
29:29 - resize a single server to make it larger
29:31 - or smaller it's a lot easier to add
29:34 - extra servers of the same size so you
29:36 - just generally will only see it
29:38 - associated with horizontal scaling now
29:40 - the question is is how would you
29:42 - automatically
29:44 - scale in or out and generally there all
29:46 - cloud providers have a service for that
29:48 - the one that is for oracle is called
29:50 - auto scaling configuration so in oci you
29:53 - can configure scaling rules for your
29:55 - instances with the oracle autoscaling
29:57 - configuration so you could say when my
29:59 - server is uh
30:01 - is being the cpu is being 75 utilized
30:04 - add another server and when it goes down
30:06 - then remove another server and so high
30:08 - elasticity is a really great way to save
30:10 - money but also to make sure that your
30:12 - web application remains available
30:14 - because it can meet the current demand
30:15 - of traffic
30:16 - [Music]
30:21 - so let's talk about um being fault
30:23 - tolerant so this is your ability for
30:24 - your service to ensure there is no
30:26 - single point of failure preventing the
30:27 - chance of failure you'll notice i had
30:29 - mentioned this in high availability the
30:31 - no single point of failure thing it
30:32 - really means fault tolerance
30:35 - but you'll see in the example it kind of
30:36 - seems very similar to
30:38 - our other example there where we have
30:40 - redundant systems to make sure that we
30:42 - don't have a problem
30:44 - so here's an example we have a database
30:46 - and so we have a master database
30:49 - and something's happened to our database
30:50 - and so we want to make sure that in the
30:52 - case of failure we can
30:54 - fail over to a redundant system so we
30:57 - call this a slave and it's on standby
30:59 - because it's not in active use but
31:02 - it will be once we move it over and a
31:03 - really good way to conceptualize this is
31:06 - if if you think of like a play like for
31:08 - theater you have the lead actor or
31:10 - actress and they always have an
31:12 - understudy a person that will take the
31:14 - the the main actor actresses place if
31:17 - they get sick
31:19 - and they will know everything they'll be
31:20 - up to date on everything and so that is
31:22 - what we have here where we have that
31:24 - says it's in sync because that standby
31:26 - slave has the exact same information as
31:28 - the master it's just not in use and so
31:30 - the and so when there is a failure we
31:32 - call it a failover that uh that's when
31:35 - uh you plan to shift the traffic to the
31:38 - redundant system in the case the primary
31:39 - system fails so that is fault tolerance
31:43 - [Music]
31:47 - so let's talk about high durability and
31:49 - this is the last one on our list so this
31:51 - is your ability to recover from a
31:52 - disaster and to prevent the loss of data
31:55 - so solutions that recover from a
31:57 - disaster is known as disaster recovery
31:59 - dr you're going to want to remember that
32:01 - abbreviation it's used a lot in the
32:03 - cloud
32:04 - and so imagine you have a database if
32:06 - you had a single database and something
32:08 - happened to it
32:09 - you would be out of business so you want
32:11 - to have backups you might also want to
32:13 - re run your database in multiple data
32:17 - centers across multiple regions and
32:19 - that's what we're doing here and then we
32:20 - want to have backups
32:23 - so that is generally like a very sim
32:26 - simplified way of thinking about
32:28 - disaster recovery but the questions you
32:30 - should be asking is do you have backups
32:32 - how fast can you restore that backup
32:34 - does your backup still work just because
32:36 - you have a backup doesn't mean it works
32:38 - and how can you ensure your current live
32:39 - data is not corrupt so just because you
32:42 - have a backup maybe there's actually a
32:44 - bug in the real-time database
32:48 - so
32:48 - maybe an analogy would be imagine that
32:50 - you have
32:52 - defective cells in your body your body
32:54 - wants to repair those cells so you don't
32:55 - get cancer so it's always replacing old
32:58 - dead cells and and this thing can
33:00 - actually also happen with databases
33:01 - where you have bad data and you don't
33:03 - want that bad data to spread so you can
33:05 - have self
33:06 - a self-healing database
33:08 - so hopefully that makes clear what high
33:10 - durability is
33:12 - [Music]
33:16 - so let's talk about the total cost of
33:18 - ownership tco
33:20 - but you might also know this as capex
33:22 - and opex as a comparison of what the
33:24 - total cost of ownership is and to
33:27 - understand this uh this concept i have
33:29 - this nice visualization where i have two
33:31 - icebergs um where you have the ice cap
33:34 - and then what's underneath some people
33:36 - don't think this looks like uh icebergs
33:39 - um they think they look like teeth or
33:41 - something strange so what i've done is
33:43 - i've added uh some penguins and a whale
33:46 - so that you know that they are icebergs
33:48 - uh and this is the best i can draw so um
33:50 - you know don't give me too hard of a
33:52 - time but let's look at the comparison
33:53 - here so on the left-hand side there is
33:55 - capex and this would generally be your
33:57 - on-prem and you'd be purchasing software
34:00 - license fees and then you have opex on
34:02 - the right-hand side so this would be
34:04 - your cloud provider so in our case this
34:05 - is oci and what you are paying for is
34:08 - subscription fees so the idea here is
34:10 - that the total cost of ownership is
34:13 - is the idea is that if you want to own
34:15 - everything that you have to pay for
34:17 - everything and the idea is that by
34:18 - letting go of the ownership of things
34:21 - and you're going to have a lot of
34:22 - reduced costs and also reduce
34:24 - responsibilities
34:25 - and that's going to be better for you in
34:27 - the long run but let's look at on-prem
34:29 - so if you're on-prem you have to worry
34:31 - about implementation configuration
34:33 - training and then the the the large cost
34:35 - there is the physical security of your
34:37 - building the hardware that you uh need
34:39 - to buy and install and maintain uh you
34:42 - the it personnel so all the people to
34:44 - manage your on-prem data center
34:46 - but when you move to the cloud you don't
34:48 - have to do any of that all you have to
34:49 - worry about is implementation
34:50 - configuration and training all that
34:52 - other stuff that infrastructure to run
34:54 - your servers and everything is
34:56 - abstracted away
34:57 - uh and so what you could see is about 75
35:00 - percent saving so that's the aws example
35:02 - i'm sure it's the same for oracle but
35:04 - the idea is that uh previously you're
35:06 - paying a lot of money and now you're
35:08 - paying very little money and you can
35:09 - just focus on building your software um
35:12 - but what we really need to do for the
35:13 - oracle certification is really
35:15 - understand capex and opex because that's
35:16 - what they like to talk about
35:19 - so we're just going to cover this again
35:20 - and make sure you understand those two
35:21 - terms very clearly
35:23 - [Music]
35:27 - so let's talk about kpex versus opex
35:31 - and so kpec stands for capital
35:33 - expenditure and opera and opec stands
35:35 - for operational expenditure so for
35:37 - capital expenditure this is your on-prem
35:39 - cost like if you own everything so you
35:41 - own or rent the building you own the
35:43 - vehicles
35:45 - maybe like company vehicles you own the
35:47 - hardware uh you own any type of
35:49 - equipment to do the job and maybe you
35:51 - even own the lands uh or you rent the
35:54 - land so there is a capital expenses
35:57 - there a lot of people still like to do
36:00 - on-prem or data center because they care
36:02 - about capital expenses because they can
36:04 - get tax breaks and other things like
36:06 - that um i don't think that's a great
36:08 - practice because um you know it's better
36:11 - to uh not worry about these things um
36:14 - but some people that is a motivator in
36:16 - the enterprise world's like oh well if
36:17 - we we purchase it as a capital expense
36:20 - then we get to get a discount on it um
36:22 - for operational expenditures that would
36:24 - be like the products you purchase
36:26 - um the business itself or any systems so
36:29 - operational expenditures
36:31 - but the key takeaway i want you to have
36:33 - there is capital expenditure stands for
36:35 - capital that's where you buy things out
36:37 - rate and opex is operational
36:39 - expenditures and that's opex and this
36:41 - concept is the same thing as the tco
36:42 - where we're just looking at the
36:43 - difference between between
36:46 - who has ownership of what
36:49 - [Music]
36:52 - okay so i know we already covered the
36:55 - evolution of servers but i really wanted
36:57 - to uh make sure you understand the
36:59 - evolution of computing uh visually and
37:01 - the trade-offs as to why because it's
37:03 - going to really help you uh understand
37:04 - the difference between
37:06 - uh a bear bare metal machine vms
37:09 - containers and functions so what we have
37:12 - here is a graphical representation of a
37:14 - bare metal or you might call it a
37:16 - dedicated machine uh so the idea here is
37:19 - that we have a physical server that is
37:20 - wholly utilized by a single customer
37:23 - you don't have you have to guess your
37:25 - capacity uh and you'll probably overpay
37:27 - for an under utilized server so if you
37:29 - have an application or multiple
37:30 - applications you're always gonna end up
37:32 - with a wasted space because you're
37:34 - always gonna have to buy a larger server
37:35 - because you're anticipating you're going
37:36 - to have to fill it but that space is
37:38 - going to be costing you money because
37:40 - it's not being utilized
37:42 - upgrading beyond your capacity would be
37:43 - slow and expensive because you'd have to
37:45 - buy an additional server or you'd have
37:46 - to replace the server you're limited by
37:49 - the operating system so you have one uh
37:51 - operating system installed it's going to
37:53 - be hard to patch and update especially
37:55 - if you have multiple applications
37:57 - and if you do have multiple applications
37:59 - running on a single server because
38:00 - you're trying to save money
38:01 - you might have conflicts in resource
38:03 - sharing so one might use more memory
38:05 - than the others because they're not
38:06 - virtually isolated or one could cause a
38:08 - vulnerability than the other one
38:10 - but the advantages of having a dedicated
38:12 - or bare metal machine is that you have a
38:14 - guarantee of security privacy and full
38:16 - utility of the underlying resources but
38:18 - with the caveat that you're actually
38:19 - able to configure it so that it is
38:21 - secure private and etc
38:23 - and so notice that i have an asterisk
38:24 - over the word dedicated so
38:26 - dedicated could just mean that you
38:28 - wholly utilize a single customer
38:31 - but the thing with bare metal is that
38:32 - there is no hypervisor layer so you
38:34 - could have a dedicated virtual machine
38:36 - or a dedicated bare metal machine but
38:39 - you'd never actually ever have a bare
38:41 - metal machine that is not dedicated i
38:43 - don't think there is a shared version of
38:44 - it
38:45 - so just note that there is no hypervisor
38:48 - at this layer it's like the original
38:49 - server where you have no no extra
38:52 - software layer for abstraction
38:55 - [Music]
39:00 - so now we're going to take a look at vms
39:01 - they're also known as virtual machines
39:03 - so you can run multiple virtual machines
39:05 - on one machine so look at our graphic
39:07 - there and you'll notice that it's not
39:09 - just one app it's multiple applications
39:12 - uh and so the way we're able to launch
39:14 - virtual machines is with the software
39:16 - layer layer called hypervisor that's all
39:19 - you need to remember that hypervisor is
39:20 - the one that makes virtual machines work
39:23 - and it's a physical server shared by
39:24 - multiple customers if it wasn't and
39:27 - you're the only one using it it would be
39:28 - called a dedicated machine so you can
39:30 - definitely have
39:31 - dedicated virtual machines it just
39:33 - depends on how you want to use that word
39:35 - dedicated
39:36 - you only pay for a fraction of the
39:37 - server because you're sharing that cost
39:39 - with everyone else
39:41 - you're still overpaying for
39:42 - underutilized virtual machines so the
39:44 - whole server you're not paying for the
39:46 - entire server anymore you're paying for
39:48 - the slice of server um that you've
39:51 - chosen to use
39:52 - you are limited by the guest operating
39:54 - system so the the
39:57 - the machine has an operating system and
39:59 - in the virtual machine you have the
40:00 - guest operating system but if you want
40:02 - to run multiple apps they're all limited
40:04 - by that uh that same one but multiple
40:07 - apps on a single virtual machine can
40:08 - result in conflicts and resource sharing
40:10 - so we still have the problem as we did
40:12 - before where one app could use more
40:13 - memory than the other and there's no way
40:15 - of setting limits on in each individual
40:17 - app so that is virtual machines and
40:20 - we'll move on to containers
40:23 - [Music]
40:28 - so now with containers uh what we have
40:31 - done is
40:32 - we are running a virtual machine that's
40:34 - running multiple containers and so
40:36 - container is just another isolation of
40:38 - your application but it also bundles in
40:41 - with it uh like os layer and package
40:44 - stuff so we're not bound by the actual
40:46 - operating system so the the software
40:49 - layer that controls the ability to run
40:50 - multiple containers if you're using
40:52 - docker it's called a docker daemon it's
40:53 - like hypervisor but that's for
40:55 - containers and your server can have
40:57 - hypervisor and docker daemons
41:00 - at the same time
41:02 - but the best part about this is that now
41:04 - we can
41:05 - maximize
41:06 - the utility of our server so instead of
41:08 - it being wasted space it we now have uh
41:11 - available capacity and it's a lot more
41:13 - cost effective because it's very easy
41:15 - for us to launch isolate isolate
41:18 - applications and we don't have to worry
41:20 - about them affecting each other
41:22 - and we don't have to worry about uh
41:24 - messing with the configuration of the os
41:25 - because it's all isolated
41:27 - so your containers share the same
41:28 - underlying os but the containers are
41:30 - more efficient
41:31 - than multiple vms
41:33 - and multiple apps can run side by side
41:35 - without being limited to the same os
41:37 - requirements and will not cause
41:39 - conflicts during resource sharing so you
41:41 - look at this you say how can we get any
41:43 - better than this and that's what
41:44 - functions will be next but you know
41:46 - hopefully the takeaway here is that we
41:47 - have less wasted space with
41:50 - containers or i should say now the space
41:52 - is more flexible or available for us to
41:54 - utilize
41:55 - [Music]
42:00 - so now we'll take a look here at
42:01 - functions and functions breaks down um
42:04 - our computing even further so
42:06 - uh what we do have is we have a managed
42:08 - vm and we also have managed containers
42:11 - so we're not responsible for the
42:12 - containers or the vms the cloud provider
42:14 - has ones for us and this is known as
42:16 - serverless compute because you don't
42:18 - have to worry
42:20 - about
42:21 - like setting up the containers or
42:23 - setting up the vms or anything all you
42:25 - need to do is upload your code and
42:27 - choose the amount of memory duration
42:28 - that you need and you're only
42:30 - responsible for the code and data and
42:31 - nothing else so it's extremely cost
42:33 - effective and you only pay for the time
42:35 - the code runs
42:36 - vms only run when there is code to be
42:38 - executed the only downside to
42:42 - functions or serverless compute is that
42:43 - they generally have a cold start so the
42:45 - these the vm that runs the actual or the
42:48 - containers that need to need to be
42:50 - launched and so there's that time it
42:52 - takes for it to launch um and that's
42:54 - only that's the only downside but there
42:56 - are ways around it but the point is is
42:58 - that uh with with serverless or uh or
43:00 - con
43:01 - or serverless compute it you can see
43:03 - that there's a lot less responsibility
43:05 - that you have to manage but there is
43:07 - lack of flexibility because you you're
43:09 - constrained with whatever those managed
43:10 - containers are have but anyway that's
43:13 - functions
43:14 - [Music]
43:19 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
43:21 - and we are starting on a new section
43:23 - here called the oci global
43:24 - infrastructure where we're going to look
43:26 - at all the
43:28 - bigger things that
43:29 - run
43:30 - the oci platform and the first thing
43:33 - we're going to look at is called regions
43:35 - so region is a geographically distinct
43:37 - location that has many data centers uh
43:40 - data centers uh in ocr called
43:42 - availability domains which we are going
43:44 - to talk about uh shortly here um and so
43:48 - i just want to emphasize that i say a
43:49 - region is a geographically distinct
43:51 - location uh the oracle documentation
43:54 - calls it a localized geographical area
43:57 - um i think we're picking hairs here but
43:59 - on the exam you might see it called a
44:01 - localized geographical area just realize
44:03 - that it's the same thing but the idea is
44:04 - it's just a part it's a place in the
44:06 - world okay and as of the year 2020 oci
44:10 - has 21 regions and they plan on having
44:13 - 15 more
44:14 - the three kinds of regions you can have
44:17 - are commercial so that's any customer
44:18 - can launch a resource in these regions
44:20 - government so only governments can
44:22 - launch resources in these regions
44:24 - and then we have azure connected so we
44:26 - have some commercial regions that are
44:28 - connected to microsoft azure which is
44:29 - another cloud provider
44:31 - um and it's similar it's similar in
44:33 - terms of services and stuff but they
44:35 - seem to work together pretty well uh if
44:38 - you're still not sure about what regions
44:40 - are i'll pull up the website here in a
44:42 - moment but i just want to show you a
44:43 - technical architectural diagram and this
44:45 - is the first architectural diagram of
44:46 - this course so what we have here is a a
44:50 - representation of oci so oci there is
44:52 - the actual platform and then we have a
44:55 - region because that's where you would
44:56 - launch your servers and a region can be
44:58 - any like a bunch of places in the world
45:00 - so it could be in toronto or it could be
45:03 - in tokyo so in this one we have one that
45:05 - is for tokyo
45:06 - and inside there we have an ad that's
45:08 - the the actual data center and in that
45:10 - data center we have our actual server
45:13 - okay so that is a region and now we'll
45:15 - just hop over to the website so you get
45:16 - a better visual idea what a region is
45:20 - so i found a world map here of all the
45:22 - regions for
45:24 - oracle and so the ones in red are the
45:26 - ones are commercial those are the
45:28 - regions you'll be able to launch your
45:29 - resources within then you have
45:30 - government regions those are the ones in
45:32 - blue as you can see they only have two
45:34 - currently here in north america
45:36 - these government regions exist because
45:38 - the government wants to
45:39 - launch resources onto the cloud but
45:42 - they need to meet certain requirements
45:44 - so these data centers are highly
45:46 - specialized for
45:48 - government regulations so unless you
45:50 - work for the government you're not going
45:51 - to be able to launch resources within
45:52 - those regions then you can see we have
45:55 - planned regions
45:56 - here so that's just oracle saying hey
45:58 - we're going to have more servers soon so
46:00 - please keep
46:01 - please make sure that you use oracle
46:04 - um there's also azure connected regions
46:06 - but they're not showing up here on this
46:08 - map
46:09 - so it's probably an ashburn in phoenix
46:12 - so it's just not clear it's very hard to
46:13 - find that graphic if you want a full
46:15 - list of regions you can go to the
46:16 - documentation here and here they all are
46:19 - they have this region identifier uh so
46:21 - that's what you're going to be used to
46:22 - looking at this is how you're going to
46:24 - identify the regions but they also have
46:26 - this thing called a region key here so
46:28 - we have sdk
46:29 - mel and etc and it shows how many
46:31 - availability domains those are the
46:33 - amount of data centers within that
46:34 - region which we'll talk about more later
46:37 - um if you want to see like actually how
46:39 - you switch regions when you log into the
46:42 - actual provider you'll be able to drop
46:44 - this down and just switch the region
46:45 - that you are in
46:47 - and then if we come over here
46:49 - just to this page here this shows us
46:51 - that not all services are available in
46:53 - every single region so if you want to
46:57 - make best use of
46:59 - all the oracle services
47:02 - they're always going to be available in
47:03 - u.s east or usc 1. i bet they always
47:05 - launch their new services there but just
47:07 - be aware that you might not have access
47:09 - to certain services and it just could be
47:11 - a matter of time for them to
47:13 - get the infrastructure they need to be
47:14 - able to run those services within your
47:16 - region
47:17 - uh and so i think that is everything we
47:19 - need to know about region so there you
47:20 - go
47:22 - [Music]
47:26 - so let's take a look at ads and ads is
47:29 - short for availability domain and this
47:31 - is what oci calls a data center and a
47:33 - data center is a secured building that
47:35 - contains hundreds of thousands of
47:36 - computers
47:37 - on the right hand side we have an
47:38 - example of an interior of a data center
47:41 - and of course you wouldn't want to have
47:43 - your dog there but i love that photo and
47:44 - all those wires on the right hand side
47:46 - are connected to a ton of servers
47:49 - and so
47:50 - a region will generally contain three
47:53 - data centers and that is a very magic
47:55 - number and we'll talk about that here in
47:56 - a moment
47:57 - but to talk about data centers within a
47:59 - region they are they need to be isolated
48:02 - from each other so in diff completely
48:04 - different buildings and the reason why
48:06 - is that if one data center fails you
48:08 - have other ones you can rely on but
48:10 - another important thing is that the
48:11 - servers need to or these data centers
48:13 - need to be
48:14 - just close enough so they provide low
48:16 - latency so those are the two things they
48:19 - need to be far enough away
48:20 - and isolate so
48:22 - there's no disaster but close enough
48:23 - that they're super super fast to talk to
48:26 - each other and this comes down to our
48:28 - last thing here which is um it's a
48:30 - common practice to run your work
48:31 - workloads in at least three availability
48:34 - domains to ensure services remain
48:35 - available in case one or two data
48:37 - centers fail now when i use that word
48:39 - workload
48:40 - that's the same thing as if i said
48:42 - service or web application so you'll see
48:44 - me interchange those words throughout
48:46 - this course workloads service and web
48:48 - application it generally means the same
48:50 - thing
48:51 - and so here is an architectural diagram
48:53 - of a region and in that region we have
48:56 - three data centers so ad-1 8283
48:59 - and this architectural diagram is not
49:01 - actually accurate because ca toronto one
49:03 - doesn't actually have
49:05 - um
49:06 - three data centers in that region so we
49:08 - said earlier that generally there's
49:10 - three data centers but toronto is not
49:12 - one of them but you'll see me use it as
49:13 - an example lot because that is where i'm
49:15 - from
49:16 - but anyway so this comes down to 1ad
49:19 - regions so oci
49:22 - regions
49:23 - not all ocr regions have 3 ads and it's
49:26 - a common strategy for cloud providers to
49:27 - initially launch a new region with only
49:30 - a single data center add more later
49:32 - and i mean this isn't great because if
49:35 - you want to work in enterprise you have
49:37 - to meet that minimum of having your
49:39 - workloads in three
49:41 - and three data centers in a region
49:44 - but
49:45 - the reason why oci does this is because
49:47 - they're trying to
49:48 - expand their business as quickly as
49:49 - possible and so it's important for them
49:52 - to open as many regions and they promise
49:53 - they'll say oh we'll open more later
49:55 - down the road
49:56 - so if we look at 1 80 regions and 380
49:59 - regions you'll see that the majority of
50:02 - oracle regions only have one data center
50:05 - and there's only four regions that have
50:08 - three data centers germany
50:11 - london and
50:13 - uh
50:14 - the states
50:16 - so
50:16 - in this list we're actually only listing
50:18 - 16
50:19 - and we said earlier there were 21
50:21 - regions
50:22 - the reason why there's only 16 in this
50:24 - list is because we're only listing the
50:25 - commercial regions i'm not sure about
50:27 - the government
50:28 - regions but that's the reason
50:30 - this is a bit more short but there you
50:32 - go that's ads
50:34 - and that's it
50:37 - [Music]
50:42 - so let's take a look now at
50:44 - fds and fds is short for fault domains
50:47 - and fault domains is what oci calls a
50:50 - logical data center so what is a logical
50:52 - data center it's a virtual or abstract
50:54 - data center within a physical data
50:56 - center
50:57 - so the reason why we have these
50:59 - illogical data centers is that the
51:00 - physical data center which we call an
51:02 - availability domain contains resources
51:05 - such as infrastructure hardware and some
51:07 - of those resources are logically grouped
51:08 - together and made accessible to you
51:10 - within the oracle console
51:12 - and the reason why is that by having an
51:14 - abstraction on top of our physical data
51:16 - center this allows our cloud provider to
51:18 - put layers in between the uh in between
51:21 - such as logical security controls
51:22 - monitoring tools and fault tolerance and
51:25 - you'll notice fault tolerance is
51:26 - emphasized because that's the whole
51:28 - point of fault domains
51:30 - and
51:30 - the whole point of fault domains is that
51:32 - it's to isolate groupings of hardware
51:34 - within a data center so that they don't
51:37 - share a single point of failure so here
51:40 - is a diagram and again we're using ca
51:42 - toronto one which again only has a
51:45 - single region but for whatever reason
51:46 - i'm listing two but within that data
51:49 - center the the ad here
51:51 - right the uh the availability domain we
51:53 - have uh two fault domains and so the
51:56 - idea is like imagine there was a fire in
51:58 - the data center and so only half of the
52:00 - data center burnt down and if you happen
52:03 - to have your servers in the second fault
52:05 - domain then uh you know they would
52:07 - remain uh operational so this is just
52:09 - another way to reduce
52:11 - or to improve uh the fault tolerance of
52:14 - your systems and so that's the purpose
52:16 - of a fault domain
52:19 - [Music]
52:23 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
52:25 - and we are now looking at oci concepts
52:27 - and this is just a short section talking
52:29 - about some of the terminologies about
52:31 - that are in
52:33 - oci
52:34 - and so the first one we want to talk
52:35 - about is the console and so if you're
52:38 - going to hear me mention the word
52:39 - console multiple times and when i say
52:40 - that we're referring to the simple and
52:42 - intuitive web-based user interface that
52:44 - you can use to access and manage the
52:46 - oracle cloud infrastructure so see this
52:48 - this is the console anytime we are doing
52:50 - anything in oracle
52:52 - whether it's launching a server
52:54 - deleting a database or creating a new
52:56 - user we're using the console so
52:59 - just be aware of what that is
53:01 - [Music]
53:06 - so let's look at the concept of tenancy
53:08 - so when you first create your oci
53:10 - account oracle will create you a tenancy
53:13 - by default and this is where all your
53:15 - resources are going to go initially and
53:18 - what a tendency is it's a secure and
53:20 - isolated partition within oci where you
53:22 - create organize and administer your
53:24 - cloud resources
53:26 - a tendency is also known as a root
53:28 - compartment and a compartment is also
53:30 - another oci concept which we'll cover
53:32 - here shortly
53:33 - but you can see that we can have
53:35 - compartments within our compartments and
53:36 - our root compartment is also known as a
53:39 - tendency
53:40 - [Music]
53:45 - so now let's take a look at the osa uh
53:47 - concept of compartments so a compartment
53:49 - is a logical collection of related
53:51 - resources that can be accessed only by
53:53 - certain groups that have been given
53:55 - permission by an administrator
53:57 - and so a resource would be
54:00 - a cloud service so that could be
54:02 - an instance or vcns or block volume so
54:05 - the majority of cloud services in oci
54:09 - and so if you want to create
54:10 - compartments you just press create
54:12 - compartment and you can create a bunch
54:13 - there and so we can see we have three in
54:16 - this example
54:18 - one thing we want to note is that
54:20 - when you first create your account
54:22 - oracle creates you a tendency on sign up
54:24 - and this is known as a root compartment
54:26 - and that holds all of your cloud
54:28 - resources by default that's where
54:30 - they're gonna go
54:31 - uh you can only uh and some other
54:33 - additional things about compartments you
54:34 - can nest them and you can ask them
54:36 - six levels deep you can add and delete
54:39 - them whenever you like
54:40 - compartments are not region specific so
54:42 - you can group resources across region
54:44 - resources can be easily moved to other
54:46 - compartments
54:48 - you can
54:49 - compartment resources can interact with
54:51 - each other you can apply policies to
54:53 - compartments to determine user access
54:56 - and you can associate a compartment to a
54:57 - budget for cost analysis so you can see
54:59 - compartments um have a lot of
55:01 - functionality behind them
55:03 - but generally you know that's what they
55:05 - do
55:10 - so now we're going to take a look at oc
55:11 - ids so ocids is short for oracle cloud
55:14 - ids and this is a unique id assigned by
55:16 - oracle to your cloud resources and the
55:19 - reason they do this is so that you're
55:20 - able to easily identify these resources
55:22 - within your policies or maybe the api
55:25 - uh just to so that you can interact with
55:27 - them and so this is the format of an oc
55:30 - id so you have the uscid one the
55:32 - resource type the realm the region the
55:34 - future use and unique id it's not so
55:37 - important for us to go through all those
55:38 - all i want you to take away from this is
55:40 - that it's a unique identifier identifier
55:42 - for a resource here's an example of a
55:46 - tendency and you can see it's very long
55:48 - and complicated and then here is one for
55:50 - an instance so a server
55:52 - so that's oci ids
55:54 - [Music]
55:58 - so now i want to talk about how do we
56:00 - get pragmatic access to oci so
56:03 - the main way is through an api an
56:05 - application programming interface and
56:07 - this is a way to interact with cloud
56:09 - services pragmatically
56:10 - and this concept of api is not specific
56:12 - to oracle it's for all
56:15 - cloud providers or applications
56:18 - and so the api is how you would get
56:21 - access to it but there has to be some
56:22 - vehicle or mechanism to interact with
56:24 - the api so one way would be to use a
56:26 - command line interface also known as a
56:28 - cli
56:29 - and this is a shell terminal program
56:31 - that you could use
56:33 - you'd have to have linux and
56:35 - you'd have to have a terminal to access
56:37 - it but if you wanted to easily do it if
56:39 - you didn't have a linux machine
56:41 - oracle has
56:42 - a a web browser-based terminal called
56:45 - cloud shell and that's going to let you
56:47 - interact with the cli and it's going to
56:49 - already be pre-authenticated so it's
56:50 - already going to have
56:52 - the access access tokens to allow you to
56:54 - start interacting with cloud services
56:56 - pragmatically another way would be to
56:58 - use a software development kit also
57:00 - known as an sdk
57:01 - and so this allows you to use common
57:03 - programming languages
57:05 - so that you can
57:06 - [Music]
57:07 - build applications that interact with
57:10 - oci
57:11 - and they currently support java go ruby
57:14 - and python
57:15 - and the way you'd actually get
57:16 - programmatic access is that you'd have
57:18 - to have um an api public key private key
57:21 - so you'd generate this on your own and
57:23 - you would upload it into oracle some
57:25 - other cloud providers you just press a
57:27 - button it generates it for you but with
57:28 - oracle you have to generate them
57:30 - yourselves and upload them yourselves so
57:32 - there you go
57:34 - [Music]
57:38 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
57:40 - and we are starting off a new section
57:42 - which is the core services for oci and
57:45 - starting uh with the first and most
57:47 - important one are the computing services
57:50 - so first on our list we have virtual
57:52 - machines so virtual machines is a
57:53 - multi-tenant server running a hypervisor
57:56 - layer so the idea here is you choose
57:58 - your os virtual image and you launch
57:59 - your server you share the cost with
58:01 - other customers so you save so anytime
58:03 - you launch a server this is generally
58:06 - the go to server that you're going to
58:08 - want to launch
58:09 - because it's the most cost effective and
58:11 - the most flexible if you don't
58:12 - understand what a hypervisor layer is
58:14 - right now do not worry we're going to
58:16 - talk about it
58:17 - shortly
58:18 - next we have container engines so this
58:21 - uh service for oci is basically docker
58:24 - as a service it allows you to run docker
58:26 - containers on a virtual machine
58:28 - so this is very popular for microservice
58:30 - or containerized architecture
58:32 - then we have the oci functions service
58:35 - so this is serverless compute you just
58:37 - upload your code and the cloud provi uh
58:39 - provider takes care of the rest so the
58:41 - code is designed to run for a short
58:43 - period of time and you choose a managed
58:44 - container with a run time so if you have
58:46 - ruby code you upload your ruby code i
58:48 - don't know if they support ruby but as
58:49 - an example you would upload your code it
58:51 - would run it and then it would stop but
58:53 - the idea is that um it's a lot more cost
58:55 - effective than a virtual machine and
58:58 - it's just also
59:00 - a lot less responsibility for you then
59:02 - we have dedicated virtual hosts so this
59:05 - is a single tenant server that is
59:06 - running a hypervisor layer where you can
59:09 - run multiple virtual machines you don't
59:11 - share the server with anyone else so you
59:13 - get greater security and performance are
59:14 - guaranteed but you can still run your
59:16 - own virtual machines and last on our
59:19 - list is bare metal so bare metal is a
59:21 - dedicated server that has no hyper visor
59:24 - layer so bare metal allows you to
59:26 - provide your applications with direct
59:28 - access to the processor and memory
59:30 - resources underlying server and this is
59:32 - suited for specialized workloads where
59:34 - the hypervisor would hinder performance
59:36 - so some people they just really want the
59:38 - original server you know like uh they
59:41 - there's nothing on it and they can
59:42 - configure it and they have that option
59:44 - so remember earlier when i when we
59:46 - talked about the evolution of servers
59:47 - and i said that everybody's still using
59:49 - everything well this is that perfect
59:50 - example of that but let's get more into
59:52 - the details as to you know why we want
59:55 - to use
59:56 - one type of setup over another
59:59 - so now what i want to do is help you
60:00 - decide which computing service you
60:02 - should choose based on the level of
60:03 - control or responsibility you want to
60:05 - have the more the more control you have
60:08 - over security configuration the more
60:10 - responsible you're going to have the
60:11 - more time it's going to take for you to
60:13 - maintain
60:15 - and spend money on those resources so if
60:17 - you can let oci do it i definitely
60:19 - recommend it for you and across the top
60:20 - we have bare metal dedicated virtual
60:22 - hosts vms vm is short for virtual
60:25 - machine you'll hear me use that
60:26 - abbreviation a lot in this course
60:27 - container engines and functions and so
60:30 - the first thing we want to look at is
60:31 - your code so you're always responsible
60:33 - for your code no matter what computing
60:34 - service that you choose
60:36 - so just be aware of that the nexus app
60:38 - container and when i'm saying container
60:40 - i'm using this in a very
60:42 - generalized term maybe we're talking
60:44 - about containers as being
60:46 - the vm or whatever but the point is is
60:48 - that
60:49 - all the way up to
60:51 - functions is the only time that oci is
60:53 - responsible for it so if you want to use
60:56 - containers or sorry if you do not want
60:58 - to manage your container use uh the
61:00 - functions
61:01 - the next layer is your runtime a runtime
61:04 - is uh it's like you're setting so your
61:06 - environment variables common libraries
61:08 - directory structure networking neighbors
61:09 - all those sorts of uh configurations on
61:11 - your os and so
61:13 - you have a less control when you're
61:15 - using the container engine service or
61:17 - the functions service
61:19 - next is your operating system and so
61:21 - for your operating system if you're
61:22 - using bare metal dedicated virtual hosts
61:24 - or vms
61:25 - you have more control over what os you
61:27 - choose
61:29 - then down below
61:31 - we have virtualization so virtualization
61:35 - is being taken care of
61:37 - for you by oci with the vms and the
61:39 - dedicated virtual host
61:41 - there is no virtualization on bare metal
61:44 - so if you do want to have it you're
61:45 - going to have to add that hyper visor
61:47 - layer yourself so there you go that is
61:50 - the um the idea with level control for
61:53 - computing services
61:55 - [Music]
61:59 - so next on our list is storage services
62:02 - starting with block volume so block
62:04 - volume i like to think of it as having a
62:06 - local virtual hard drive where you
62:07 - choose the hhd or ssd
62:10 - uh this is what you're going to be
62:11 - primarily using when you're using your
62:12 - virtual machines you're going to want to
62:14 - be using a block volume attached to it
62:17 - the next thing we have is a local nvme
62:20 - nvme is a transfer protocol for ssd that
62:23 - allows the drive to operate very very
62:25 - efficiently i had to look this one up
62:28 - but i'm sure people that make video
62:29 - gaming computers or that do video
62:32 - editing really do care about using mvme
62:34 - because it gives you extremely fast
62:35 - performance
62:37 - then you have file storage and so file
62:39 - storage is when you're using a file
62:40 - system such as nsf
62:43 - version 3. this allows multiple
62:45 - connections to the same storage device
62:46 - at the same time which is really nice
62:48 - when you're doing
62:49 - cloud stuff and you need something to
62:51 - have the same
62:53 - files
62:54 - then you have object storage so object
62:56 - storage is serverless storage and you
62:57 - can upload as many files as you like and
62:59 - it scales without worrying about running
63:01 - out of space or data loss because
63:03 - generally the data you put into object
63:06 - storage is highly available it will be
63:07 - replicated across multiple data centers
63:10 - then we have archive storage this is
63:11 - long-term cold storage and this is when
63:13 - you need to keep files around for a very
63:15 - long period of time that you might
63:17 - infrequently access and so the idea is
63:19 - you wouldn't want to put them in object
63:20 - storage because um
63:23 - you know the idea is that
63:24 - it'd be more expensive so if you if you
63:26 - never have to use them so let's say you
63:28 - have to hold on to records for the next
63:29 - seven years uh for like let's say for
63:32 - taxes you'd want to put them in archive
63:34 - storage so they're not uh
63:36 - costing you more money
63:39 - so i want to talk a bit more about
63:40 - storage services and just make it a bit
63:42 - more clear the difference between block
63:43 - versus file versus object because those
63:46 - are the main three that you need to be
63:47 - thinking about so let's first talk about
63:49 - block storage and so oracle service is
63:51 - called block volume and this is where
63:53 - the data is split into evenly split
63:55 - blocks and the data is directly accessed
63:58 - by the operating system and there's only
64:00 - support for a single right volume so if
64:02 - you have multiple virtual machines
64:04 - you're going to have multiple block
64:06 - volumes and you're not going to be able
64:08 - to share that volume with other machines
64:10 - or at least if you do it's not very easy
64:13 - and this has to just do with the fact
64:14 - that it's only the operating system
64:16 - accessing it the protocols that are
64:18 - being used here is fc maybe iscsi
64:21 - or iscsi and there's another one there
64:24 - you don't really need to know the
64:25 - transfer protocols but i'm just trying
64:27 - to point out that a block volume is
64:29 - directly accessed by the os and only
64:31 - supports a single right volume so you're
64:33 - not sharing that drive with multiple uh
64:35 - vms or users
64:37 - next is file storage and file storage is
64:39 - stored with data and metadata uh and so
64:42 - with this
64:44 - format you can have multiple connections
64:46 - via a network share
64:48 - so you can use protocols such as nfs or
64:51 - smb and so it's going to allow multiple
64:54 - users or multiple vms to access
64:57 - that
64:59 - file system and it's going to act as if
65:01 - you're all on the same computer which is
65:03 - really nice so it supports multiple
65:05 - reads but when you are writing to a file
65:07 - it will lock so if i'm writing on a file
65:09 - then you can't access it until i'm done
65:11 - with it
65:13 - last we have object storage so object
65:15 - storage is stored with data metadata and
65:17 - unique id the protocols we're going to
65:19 - be using here is http
65:22 - or hps and api
65:24 - the way you're going to access these
65:26 - files is through the internet
65:29 - so that's how you're going to get access
65:30 - to them the advantage of object storage
65:32 - is there is no
65:33 - there is no limit in terms of the size
65:36 - of the files or or the amount of files
65:39 - that you store
65:40 - or if there is they're very very high
65:42 - you're not going to be affected by them
65:43 - and the last thing is that it supports
65:46 - multiple reads and writes so there's no
65:47 - locks so you aren't going to be hindered
65:49 - if somebody is working with a file
65:52 - um so yeah those are your three
65:54 - solutions and another thing that i don't
65:55 - have in the slide here but um block
65:57 - volume is the most expensive at scale
65:59 - and object storage is the least
66:00 - expensive at scale so uh you know the
66:03 - the more you get to the serverless and
66:06 - that object storage is a serverless
66:07 - service uh the more cost effective it
66:09 - gets
66:11 - [Music]
66:15 - okay so now we're going to look at
66:16 - networking services networking is
66:18 - generally very complicated for any cloud
66:20 - provider
66:22 - for the foundation certification you
66:24 - don't need to know it in great detail
66:26 - you just have to have some practical
66:27 - knowledge of it
66:28 - so don't worry if you don't know all the
66:30 - little details here
66:32 - but let's go through it so for
66:33 - networking services we've already seen
66:35 - some of these earlier so the first thing
66:37 - is region so a region
66:39 - is a geographical location of your
66:41 - network and so
66:43 - there's my line i don't usually annotate
66:45 - very often but your region would be here
66:47 - okay so we have ca toronto one and so
66:50 - that is a geographical location the next
66:52 - is your availability domain and remember
66:54 - its availability domain is short for ad
66:57 - and this is a data center for your aws
66:59 - resources so
67:01 - here we have the
67:02 - aed and so this one is ad1
67:05 - then you have your fault domains this is
67:07 - a logical grouping of your resources in
67:08 - a data center and so there is our fault
67:12 - domain then you have your vcn and vcn
67:15 - stands for virtual cloud network
67:17 - you're definitely going to want to know
67:18 - that one
67:20 - and i believe i have a complete slide
67:22 - for virtual cloud network just to really
67:24 - make sense of that and so it is here
67:27 - and that is your that is a logically
67:29 - isolated section of the oc cloud where
67:31 - you can launch your ocr resources then
67:33 - you have internet gateway so internet
67:35 - gateway is how you get access to the
67:37 - internet so there is the symbol for
67:39 - internet gateway you can see that it
67:40 - sits on the edge of um
67:44 - of oci and that's how it gets out to the
67:45 - internet then you have subnets subnets
67:48 - is a logical partition of of an ip
67:50 - network into multiple smaller network
67:53 - segments and we'll talk about that a
67:54 - little bit more in the next slide and
67:56 - this orange line around here is that
67:58 - subnet um but anyway the easiest way to
68:01 - think of a subnet is it's a slice of the
68:03 - vcn
68:05 - and then down below we have a virtual
68:07 - firewall options and so
68:09 - we have security rules and network
68:11 - security groups and security lists all i
68:13 - want you to take away from this is that
68:14 - these three things uh protect your uh
68:18 - your resources and so here this icon
68:20 - here is
68:23 - a one of those i can't remember which
68:24 - one it is i think it's a network
68:26 - security group i'd have to double check
68:27 - but the point is is that it represents
68:29 - uh a virtual fire firewall that is
68:32 - protecting uh your server and that's
68:35 - your server right there so you know
68:36 - that's one part of networking services
68:38 - and we'll hop on to the next slide
68:42 - all right so we're on to the second part
68:44 - of our networking services the first one
68:46 - was really if you're a cloud native or
68:47 - using it for your own personal account
68:49 - and these networking services are really
68:51 - for enterprise or hybrid hybrid
68:52 - architecture but we still need to learn
68:54 - them
68:56 - we don't need to remember them in
68:57 - granular detail but you should generally
68:59 - know what they do so the first is
69:01 - service gateway so here's service
69:02 - gateway and what service gateway does is
69:04 - it creates a secure tunnel that keeps
69:05 - traffic within the oci network so here
69:08 - is the symbol over here for service
69:10 - gateway and what you're seeing is that
69:13 - it's creating this secure tunnel to this
69:15 - uh service which is object storage and
69:17 - the reason why we want a secure tunnel
69:19 - is that generally there are certain
69:21 - services especially serverless services
69:23 - where they're not part of your vcn
69:25 - they're just they're just in the global
69:28 - oci account and if you want to access
69:31 - them they have to go out to the internet
69:32 - so this server would go out to the
69:33 - internet and go around and come back in
69:35 - and you do not want it to uh leave oci
69:37 - because as soon as you leave
69:39 - oci
69:40 - out to the internet it's no longer
69:42 - secure so by using service gateway we
69:44 - can keep the traffic within oci so it
69:46 - never leaves that's super important for
69:49 - people uh that are operating in the
69:51 - enterprise then you have nat gateway so
69:53 - that gateway is down here uh this is the
69:55 - there's actually no symbol for it so i
69:56 - made my own and what naked way does it
69:59 - allows private uh a private subnet so
70:01 - resources or servers and a private
70:03 - subnet reach out to the internet this uh
70:05 - orange dotted line is our subnet and so
70:08 - it doesn't have any access
70:11 - to the internet and so let's say we
70:13 - wanted to grab packages or software to
70:16 - update um the server and we have to get
70:18 - out the internet we use a nat to do that
70:20 - so that's done the next is ipsec vpn so
70:24 - a virtual private network is a way of
70:27 - creating a secure tunnel over the
70:29 - internet from your on-premise uh into
70:31 - oracle cloud
70:33 - uh and again anytime we leave out to the
70:35 - internet it's a dangerous territory so
70:37 - we want to secure that connection and
70:38 - that's what we're gonna use for that
70:40 - uh the next is fast connect it's just
70:42 - like um uh ipsec vpn but the difference
70:46 - is that it's a dedicated a dedicated
70:48 - secure connection to your on-prem uh to
70:51 - oracle cloud what that means it's going
70:53 - to be really really really fast so not
70:54 - only is it going to be secure but it's
70:56 - going to be
70:57 - super fast and that could matter to
71:01 - an enterprise because they want the
71:03 - experience to be just as fast as their
71:05 - on-prem data center
71:07 - then we have dynamic routing gateway so
71:10 - dynamic routing gateway is a virtual
71:11 - router that provides a path for private
71:13 - traffic between your vcn and outside
71:15 - network so to actually connect the fast
71:17 - connect or ip
71:19 - uh or vpn we need this
71:21 - drg which is that virtual private router
71:24 - if it's confusing to you it's confusing
71:26 - to me i don't ever set these things up
71:28 - but i know that it's a virtual router
71:29 - and i know that it creates a connection
71:30 - into the vcn and that's all you need to
71:32 - know too and the last one here is vcn
71:35 - peering so peering is the concept of
71:37 - connecting two vcns together
71:39 - and and treating them as the same
71:40 - network so if you have vcn1 here and
71:43 - vcn2 here then they can peer they can
71:45 - this server can talk to that server as
71:47 - if they're on the same network
71:50 - uh so those are all the concepts i
71:51 - wanted you to learn for networking
71:53 - services i know it's super complicated
71:55 - but just do your best because at the
71:56 - foundation level
71:58 - knowing networking stuff is not as
72:00 - important
72:01 - as the next level
72:02 - [Music]
72:07 - so now let's take a look at vcns and
72:09 - subnets so vcn is short for virtual
72:11 - cloud network it is a logically isolated
72:13 - section of oci
72:16 - where you can launch oci resources and
72:19 - so the way you define a vcn is you have
72:21 - to choose a range of ips using a cider
72:23 - range
72:24 - and it's not so important to know the
72:26 - math behind cider range all i want you
72:28 - to know is that it's a range of ips so
72:30 - if you chose
72:31 - 10.0.0.0 ford slash 16 that 16 is
72:34 - defining the size of the ip addresses
72:36 - and that would give you 65 000 ip
72:38 - addresses and what does that mean it's
72:40 - like if you want to launch 65 servers
72:42 - you'll you'll have enough ips to launch
72:44 - 50 or 65 000 servers
72:47 - and so there's the architectural diagram
72:49 - of
72:51 - of a of the oci network with a region
72:54 - and so there would be your vcn
72:56 - now the thing is with the vcn is we want
72:58 - to split it up into smaller logical
73:01 - sections and that's where subnets come
73:02 - into play so subnets is a logical
73:04 - partition of the ip network
73:06 - into multiple smaller network segments
73:09 - you're breaking up your ip range for
73:10 - your vcn into smaller networks and
73:13 - subnets have a
73:15 - cider range as well but the cider range
73:17 - has to be smaller than the vcn cider
73:20 - range because you're it's like cutting
73:22 - up a pie it has to be smaller you can't
73:23 - take the whole pie
73:25 - so for the example here i'm using cider
73:27 - range 10.0.0.0424
73:30 - which would give us 256 ip addresses so
73:33 - it's a very small slice out of our of
73:35 - out of our vcn
73:38 - now subnets can either be public and so
73:40 - subnets that are public are ones that
73:42 - can reach the internet and you can see
73:43 - that's where our server would be
73:44 - launched into into the actual subnet or
73:47 - if we wanted a
73:48 - a subnet where it cannot reach the
73:50 - internet we'd call that a private subnet
73:52 - that doesn't mean that it it can never
73:54 - reach the internet it's just generally
73:55 - it's not supposed to because it's
73:57 - supposed to be secure but with nats and
73:59 - some other means that it can reach the
74:01 - internet
74:03 - [Music]
74:07 - let's talk about vcin so vcin stands for
74:10 - virtual network interface card and this
74:12 - enables an interface or sorry an
74:14 - instance to connect to a vcn and
74:17 - determines how the instance connects
74:19 - with endpoints inside and outside the
74:21 - vcn now remember an instance just means
74:23 - a server so if you want your server uh
74:25 - to be able to connect um to other
74:28 - services you need a you need a vcin so
74:31 - without a vcn your server would not be
74:33 - able to communicate with the internet or
74:35 - other networked cloud services in your
74:37 - vcn and the reason we're talking about
74:39 - this is because
74:41 - we're going to be looking at security
74:42 - lists and they're dependent on
74:44 - vcins here
74:46 - but on the exam i don't think they're
74:47 - going to really be asking you about
74:48 - vcins too much
74:50 - [Music]
74:55 - so let's take a look at our virtual
74:56 - firewall options so the networking
74:58 - surface offers two virtual firewall
75:00 - features that both use security rules to
75:02 - control traffic at the packet level and
75:04 - those two are security lists abbreviated
75:07 - as sl so this is the original firewall
75:09 - feature from from the networking service
75:11 - and security lists are associated with
75:12 - subnets and the security rules apply to
75:15 - vcions
75:16 - in those subnets and that's why we were
75:18 - talking about vcins because security uh
75:20 - both of these really relate to the those
75:23 - networking components but what i want to
75:25 - remember is security lists are
75:26 - associated with subnets
75:28 - then you have networking security groups
75:30 - this is the new virtual firewall i don't
75:32 - necessarily know if it will replace the
75:33 - old one because they both kind of have
75:36 - different use cases but the
75:39 - nsgs
75:40 - are designed for the application
75:41 - components that have different security
75:43 - postures so nsgs are suppor
75:46 - are supported only for specific services
75:48 - and nsgs are directly associated with
75:50 - vcins regardless of what subnet they are
75:52 - in so
75:53 - remember secure lists are associated
75:55 - with subnets nsgs are directly
75:58 - associated with the vcins
76:01 - [Music]
76:06 - so now it's time to take a look at the
76:07 - database services um and oracle is
76:10 - generally known for databases so they do
76:12 - have a few options it can be a little
76:13 - bit confusing because some services
76:16 - especially in the console some some
76:17 - services are not distinctly uh
76:20 - isolate from each other
76:22 - but we'll work our way through it and
76:24 - it'll make sense in the end so the first
76:26 - one is vmdb systems so vm standing for
76:29 - virtual machine db standing for database
76:31 - and so it's a virtual machine running a
76:33 - manage oracle database instance and it's
76:36 - going to be backed by block storage so
76:39 - um
76:40 - this could also be a mysql database
76:42 - which we'll talk about shortly when we
76:44 - go to the next slide but it's just a
76:46 - virtual machine and it runs oracle for
76:48 - you and the reason you might want to use
76:50 - this one is that it has very fast
76:51 - provisioning and or this is the most
76:53 - general purpose database that you'll
76:55 - probably want to use the next one is vm
76:59 - bm system so bm is short for bare metal
77:02 - and so it is not running a virtual
77:04 - machine there is no hypervisor layer so
77:06 - you get a much faster uh performance it
77:09 - uses a fast local storage so if if if
77:13 - you need a server that or a database
77:14 - that is really fast this is an option
77:16 - that you might want to consider
77:18 - the next is oracle rack
77:20 - and so this is um this is i believe the
77:23 - virtual machine it's just like vmdb
77:26 - systems but it is running in a cluster a
77:28 - cluster meaning that it's running more
77:30 - than one database so so you have two uh
77:34 - instances of databases and they're
77:35 - sharing the same disk but they're
77:37 - running on different nodes and so if a
77:39 - node fails the connection is going to
77:40 - fail over to another node so this is a
77:42 - great way to get higher durability which
77:45 - we talked about
77:46 - in or sorry fault tolerance this is
77:49 - better to have a better fault tolerance
77:51 - which we talked about with our cloud
77:52 - technology concepts
77:54 - then you have exit data db systems uh
77:57 - the first time i've ever heard of
77:58 - exadata but exadata is a pre-configured
78:01 - combination of hardware and software
78:02 - that provides an infrastructure for
78:03 - running oracle databases so oracle
78:06 - created their own special combination i
78:08 - imagine that the the advantage here is
78:11 - that
78:12 - you have extremely good performance for
78:14 - very specific use cases i don't know
78:16 - what those use cases are i don't think
78:18 - it's going to matter on the exam if you
78:20 - if you know but you just need to know
78:21 - that exit data exit data db systems is
78:24 - just specialized infrastructure that
78:26 - gives you great performance and last on
78:28 - our list is autonomous so autonomous can
78:30 - be autonomous shared or dedicated the
78:32 - difference between one being
78:33 - multi-tenant or single tenant and this
78:35 - is for automatically or sorry this
78:37 - database does basically everything you
78:39 - will automatically patch upgrade it will
78:41 - do self-healing for bad data it's highly
78:43 - available by default it's secure by
78:44 - default and so it's a fully managed
78:47 - database
78:48 - it's going to cost you a lot more money
78:50 - than anything else on this list but
78:53 - it's going to it's going to do all the
78:55 - work for you so um you know it just it
78:58 - you never have to worry about this
78:59 - database so there you go
79:02 - so i just want to go over some of the uh
79:04 - database options because i do find it a
79:07 - bit confusing to know when you're
79:09 - creating what type of database in oracle
79:11 - because they have so many options so if
79:12 - you were to create a db systems or
79:16 - dbvm systems uh database option so
79:19 - that's kind of redundant how i wrote
79:20 - there
79:21 - but you could choose an oracle db system
79:23 - so that's the default and when you do
79:25 - you'd have to choose an availability
79:26 - domain any virtual machine and a shape
79:28 - type a shape type is just basically the
79:31 - vm like how much power do you want the
79:32 - machine to have like computing etc but
79:35 - you can also create a mysql
79:39 - database but what's strange is that
79:41 - when you make the oracle one you don't
79:42 - choose a fault domain but when you make
79:44 - one for mysql you can choose a fault
79:46 - domain is this going to be on the exam
79:48 - no but i just wanted to point out that
79:50 - you know i was a bit confused
79:52 - and this is what i observed as being the
79:53 - difference
79:55 - and then we have autonomous database
79:56 - options so when you go to create your
79:58 - autonomous database what you choose is
80:00 - between an oltp and an olap olap is
80:04 - going to be your data warehouse that's
80:05 - for reporting analytics and large and
80:07 - infrequent queries then you have oltp
80:10 - that's general purpose small and
80:12 - frequent and frequent queries
80:14 - um so
80:15 - oltp or transaction processing is what
80:18 - you're going to want for general
80:19 - workloads
80:20 - and then if you're working with big data
80:22 - you're going to want the data warehouse
80:24 - one then down below the next option you
80:26 - choose is between shared infrastructure
80:28 - so that's multi-tenant or dedicated that
80:30 - is single tenant then you can choose the
80:33 - license so bring your own license or you
80:35 - will use the license included so
80:37 - um again you know it's just like these
80:40 - aren't generally separated it's just
80:41 - like you go choose a database and you
80:43 - make these choices whereas in my my
80:45 - previous uh
80:47 - lecture there you saw that it looked
80:48 - like all the services were isolate
80:51 - so hopefully that clears that up when
80:52 - you're in the console if you feel a bit
80:53 - confused
80:54 - [Music]
80:58 - so let's quickly touch on oracle nosql
81:01 - and this is a service so you can have a
81:04 - nosql database so that it's a key value
81:06 - store um i'm sorry this slide is not
81:08 - more
81:10 - attractive but they just have no icons
81:12 - there's not a lot of information on it
81:14 - but generally we should know what a
81:16 - nosql database is
81:18 - and so the reason you'd want to use a
81:19 - nosql database over the other databases
81:22 - is that if you need to produce and
81:23 - consume data at a high volume and
81:25 - velocity null sql might be for you if
81:27 - you require instantaneous response time
81:29 - to match the user expectations no scale
81:31 - could be for you it's developed with
81:34 - continuous evolving data models and it
81:36 - can scale on demand based on dynamic
81:38 - workloads so there's just a point where
81:40 - uh relational databases um they they
81:42 - meet a point where it becomes very
81:44 - difficult to scale you have to do
81:45 - sharding and all these other things and
81:47 - so then it becomes a point where you
81:49 - want to move over to nosql so just think
81:51 - of nosql being for at scale
81:54 - and you know hopefully you don't get any
81:56 - questions on it but i just want to
81:57 - include it in there just in case
81:58 - [Music]
82:03 - so now i just want to cover some cloud
82:04 - native services um but really this
82:07 - section is just a bunch of oracle
82:09 - services that might show up on the exam
82:11 - and and so i need to get you a bit
82:13 - familiar with them so the first is
82:15 - oracle api gateway this is a
82:16 - comprehensive platform for managing
82:18 - delivering and securing web api so if
82:20 - you need to make a web api you're going
82:21 - to use api gateway then there's oracle
82:24 - streaming ingest and store continuous
82:26 - high volumes data streams and process
82:27 - them in real time if a question asks
82:30 - something to be in real time
82:51 - you
83:29 - so now let's talk about cloud native
83:31 - services but really what the section is
83:32 - about is just getting you exposure to
83:34 - more oracle services that might show up
83:36 - on the exam
83:38 - but you don't need to have deep
83:39 - knowledge about them so the first one is
83:40 - oracle api gateway and this is a
83:42 - comprehensive platform for managing
83:44 - delivery and securing web apis so if a
83:46 - question asks about creating an api
83:48 - it's probably uh it's probably telling
83:50 - you to choose api gateway then there's
83:52 - oracle streaming this is when you ingest
83:54 - and store continuous high volumes
83:56 - high volume data streams and process
83:58 - them in real time the question is asking
83:59 - about data streams or real time events
84:02 - then it's going to be oracle streaming
84:04 - oracle kubernetes container engine okay
84:07 - is a managed service to run kubernetes
84:09 - cluster if you see the word kubernetes
84:11 - it's talking about ok then there's
84:13 - oracle registry ocir and this is a
84:15 - repository repository for your docker
84:17 - containers if you need somewhere to
84:18 - store your docker containers it's going
84:20 - to be an ocir then there's oracle
84:22 - notifications it's a fully managed
84:24 - publish
84:25 - publish subscribe service for reliable
84:28 - and scalable message uh delivery so if
84:30 - the question has to do with something
84:31 - with notifications pub sub or message
84:33 - delivery that's what it's going to be
84:35 - the last one is oracle integrations a
84:37 - service to connect on-premise
84:39 - third-party to your oci with pre-made
84:41 - adapters for easy application
84:43 - integration so if you need to connect
84:45 - your on-prem
84:46 - to your oci in a very
84:48 - convenient way
84:50 - so oracle integrations might be the
84:52 - answer
84:53 - [Music]
84:58 - so we're on to the billion pricing
85:00 - section so let's talk about pricing
85:02 - models so oracle has ways for you to
85:04 - save with the universal credit pricing
85:06 - also known as oracle uc i'm a little bit
85:09 - confused by the terminology because i
85:10 - don't know if it applies to both their
85:12 - pricing models but i'm going to make
85:14 - mention of it because we definitely need
85:15 - to know what oracle uc is or universal
85:17 - credit pricing is the at least know of
85:19 - the terms
85:21 - and so the first way you can pay is you
85:23 - can pay as you go so p-a-y-g most other
85:26 - cloud providers call this on-demand so
85:28 - that's why i have it there and so the
85:29 - idea is that if you were to launch a
85:31 - server you're using pay-as-you-go
85:32 - there's no upfront commitment you're
85:34 - build based on hourly consumption and
85:36 - you pay at the end of the month
85:38 - the other way you could pay is monthly
85:41 - flex and so these are plans to save
85:43 - money and i guess this is what uses the
85:45 - oracle uc
85:47 - so what you do is you make a commitment
85:49 - so you say i'm going to commit for a
85:50 - minimum of 12 months
85:53 - and i'm going to commit at least a
85:55 - minimum of a thousand dollars per month
85:57 - and that's going to give me savings
85:58 - between 30 to 65 percent
86:00 - um so it's just a way if you're a larger
86:02 - company and you know what you're going
86:04 - to be using you can definitely save a
86:05 - lot of money up front there's also
86:08 - another thing to factor in for pricing
86:10 - models and that is bring your own uh
86:12 - license so oracle has been around for a
86:14 - very long time and so people are running
86:16 - oracle uh products and software on their
86:18 - on
86:19 - their on-premise data center and they
86:21 - might want to bring those licenses over
86:22 - to save money so if you bring on over
86:24 - those licenses uh then you'll get the
86:26 - same support contracts that you've
86:28 - already agreed to if you don't have an
86:30 - existing license you'll just get one
86:32 - when you use the oracle cloud platform
86:34 - and the number one thing that i want to
86:36 - emphasize number one thing is that no
86:39 - matter what region you're in the pricing
86:42 - is the same so if you if you launch a
86:45 - server in tokyo it's going to cost the
86:48 - same in canada it's going to cost the
86:50 - same in germany now why does oracle do
86:53 - this
86:54 - they say it's because it's to keep
86:56 - pricing simple
86:58 - i'm not sure if i i believe that but
87:01 - i think it's just they're a smaller
87:02 - provider and maybe in the future they
87:03 - will start changing the prices per
87:05 - region because
87:06 - if i'm a consumer wouldn't i want the
87:08 - best price i can get for that region and
87:10 - some regions will be more cost effective
87:12 - than others but for whatever reason all
87:15 - regions are the same and that is
87:16 - critical to know if you come from other
87:18 - cloud providers
87:20 - this would be a surprise to you because
87:22 - all cloud providers have different
87:23 - pricing based on regions so there you go
87:26 - so i just wanted to quickly pull up the
87:28 - oracle website just to show you where
87:30 - you can find pricing so i just searched
87:32 - oracle pricing and this will show you
87:34 - pay as you go universal credits so i
87:36 - guess universal credits is really part
87:38 - of monthly flex i still don't personally
87:40 - understand why they're called universal
87:41 - credits it makes me think that you can
87:43 - reuse them any unused amounts can be
87:45 - rolled over to the next month okay so
87:47 - there you go that's probably why they
87:48 - call them universal credits and then you
87:50 - have bring your own licenses
87:52 - if we go over to this page here this is
87:54 - the universal credit pricing you're
87:55 - going to come down here
87:56 - and you're going to notice that there is
87:58 - no regions everything is very
88:00 - standardized
88:02 - so whatever you're paying for analytics
88:04 - it's the same no matter what region
88:05 - you're in
88:06 - but that is the pay-as-you-go price and
88:08 - then that is the monthly flex price
88:10 - which is interesting because i would
88:12 - generally think that this price would
88:14 - vary based on your commitment whether
88:16 - it's
88:17 - one year or three years so i'm not
88:19 - really sure about that but what you need
88:20 - to know is that with monthly flex you
88:22 - save that's all that matters
88:23 - and then uh the last tab here this is
88:25 - just another one because this is a
88:27 - universal credit pricing but maybe you
88:29 - want to look at the actual compute
88:30 - pricing
88:32 - and so these are all the computing
88:34 - servers here so this i think this is
88:35 - their standard one so it's point zero
88:38 - three cents uh and point zero three
88:40 - cents if you're ever wondering how you
88:42 - would ever calculate your your yearly
88:43 - cost or your monthly cost you would just
88:46 - take this number here so i would take
88:48 - that i would just put it up in google i
88:49 - would do it times and i would say 730
88:52 - hours and so the the base server would
88:54 - cost you 21.
88:56 - and 90 cents that's how i always
88:58 - calculate
88:59 - my monthly cost for servers it's just
89:01 - 730 times the number so there you go
89:04 - that is um uh the pricing
89:07 - [Music]
89:11 - so i want to show you one more thing
89:13 - here and that is the cost estimator so
89:15 - if you were to type in cloud pricing
89:17 - you're going to see this button here
89:18 - we're going to click into it and this is
89:20 - going to help you determine your cost so
89:22 - you saw me do the math where i took the
89:24 - hourly comp or the hourly compute and
89:26 - just times it by 7 30. but if you really
89:28 - need to compile out your own report what
89:31 - you can do is you can use their
89:32 - estimator here so we can go here and
89:34 - just look for
89:36 - any kind of service so we have
89:37 - infrastructure
89:38 - so let's add a vm so we'll go ahead and
89:40 - hit add and then it will say what kind
89:42 - of compute we can scroll down here and
89:44 - say we want to have one instance see
89:46 - where it says pay use pay as you go 63
89:48 - dollars
89:50 - and there's just lots of things you can
89:52 - do here
89:53 - um so we would do that
89:55 - and i'm just gonna expand that so we
89:58 - have 63 dollars i could add an object
89:59 - store
90:01 - okay it says zero dollars
90:04 - um it's really based on our our storage
90:06 - so we'd have to go in here and start
90:07 - saying how much we'd use if we go to
90:08 - block volume
90:10 - uh this is um in gigabytes let's say we
90:12 - had 100 gigs
90:14 - now we can see it's four dollars so i
90:16 - just want you to be aware that there is
90:18 - a cost explorer and it will show you
90:20 - your pay as you go
90:22 - and flex it doesn't necessarily show you
90:24 - it has kind of an estimate but even here
90:26 - it doesn't
90:27 - give you a guarantee that it that is per
90:29 - month i've never hit the buy here but i
90:31 - would imagine that it just tells you to
90:33 - make a new account so there you go
90:35 - and you still have to set those up
90:37 - individually so just because you queued
90:38 - all those things up in the cost explorer
90:40 - doesn't mean that the the that they
90:42 - would create all those resources for you
90:44 - this is just a quick way of figuring out
90:46 - those costs and you can download it as a
90:48 - pdf so if you need to take it to your
90:50 - boss
90:51 - then we can just open this up here it'll
90:53 - just take me a moment
90:55 - and so there's that nice breakdown of
90:57 - all those costs
90:59 - all right so there you go um that is the
91:01 - cost explorer
91:03 - [Music]
91:08 - so let's talk about data transfer costs
91:10 - so for data transfer anything that is
91:11 - coming into um oci network is going to
91:15 - be free so data in is free we call that
91:17 - ingress
91:18 - any data that is leaving the oci network
91:20 - is going to cost us money we call that
91:23 - egress and so data transfer within the
91:25 - same availability domain is going to be
91:26 - free data transfer between available
91:29 - domains in the same region is going to
91:30 - be free data transfer between regions
91:32 - will result in a charge for data leaving
91:35 - the region
91:36 - but to really make this clear i'm going
91:37 - to give you an architectural diagram to
91:40 - to help visualize this so here's the oci
91:43 - network
91:44 - anything outside of the osa network
91:46 - we'll consider the internet imagine we
91:48 - have a server running in a data center
91:50 - in a region
91:52 - and so we have the internet and we want
91:53 - to bring data into that server so
91:56 - anything
91:57 - that's data in is going to be free
92:00 - anything leaving the oci network we're
92:02 - going to be charged for
92:04 - so now imagine we have another region
92:06 - and in this region we have an
92:08 - availability domain a data center and we
92:10 - have two servers maybe they're in
92:12 - different fault domains maybe they're
92:13 - different subnets but the point is
92:15 - they're in the same data center any data
92:17 - transfer between them is going to be
92:18 - free now imagine we have another data
92:21 - center availability domain in that
92:23 - region and we want to transfer data
92:25 - between those two that's going to be
92:26 - free because they're all in the same
92:28 - region now imagine
92:31 - imagine we want to get data from uh
92:34 - region the ch toronto one region to the
92:37 - um ap toronto one region so if you send
92:40 - data out it probably would have to go
92:42 - out to the internet and and it would and
92:44 - then it would come back in
92:46 - to that other region and so since it
92:47 - since even though we want to keep it in
92:49 - oci the fact that it's another region it
92:51 - has to leave the internet and come back
92:52 - in it's going to result in a charge now
92:54 - is there some way to bridge uh data from
92:57 - one region to another i'm not sure there
92:59 - is a service called service gateway but
93:01 - that seems to be for cloud services but
93:04 - if we could keep it all within oci i
93:06 - believe that it would be free but just
93:08 - remember if it has to go out to the
93:09 - internet it's going to cost money if it
93:11 - stays with an oci it's going to be free
93:15 - [Music]
93:19 - so i wanted to give block volume pricing
93:21 - a bit of emphasis because it's not as
93:23 - simple as one metric that it's built on
93:25 - there's actually two things you need to
93:26 - consider with block volume pricing the
93:29 - first is storage costs and the second is
93:31 - performance cost so
93:32 - for storage costs you're going to get
93:34 - build based on how what your store
93:35 - capacity is per month and so it's going
93:38 - to be the most because it's the same
93:40 - pricing in all regions it's going to be
93:42 - zero two five five uh cents per
93:45 - uh gigabyte i believe
93:47 - and then for performance cost it's going
93:49 - to be based on uh performance units per
93:52 - gpu per month
93:53 - and so
93:54 - they actually have a breakdown of three
93:56 - so for zero vpus it's zero dollars
94:00 - if you need to use 10 vp vpus it's going
94:04 - to be it's called balanced and it's
94:07 - point 17 cents if you need 20 vpus which
94:09 - they call higher performance it's zero
94:12 - 34 cents
94:13 - gigabyte per month if you're wondering
94:15 - what vpus are it's called volume
94:17 - performance units this thing is an
94:19 - oracle thing i'm not even sure exactly
94:21 - how it works i couldn't find any
94:23 - documentation on it
94:24 - but i just want you know that there are
94:26 - three categories
94:27 - and those are the prices and those are
94:29 - the options
94:30 - and those are the two factors you have
94:31 - to consider
94:32 - [Music]
94:36 - so in oracle you can actually tag your
94:38 - resources such as compute storage and
94:40 - databases and tagging allows you to
94:42 - filter resources so you can so it can be
94:44 - used in cost analysis to quickly
94:46 - determine costs or if you just want to
94:48 - find a group of resources but you're not
94:50 - necessarily applying permissions to them
94:52 - because compartments is for applying
94:54 - permissions
94:55 - so what you would do is let's say you
94:56 - had a compute resource you just say add
94:58 - a tag and then what you do is you'd fill
95:00 - in a tag key such as env and then a
95:03 - value such as prod now there is a drop
95:05 - down there where you have freeform tags
95:07 - and you have oracle tags oracle tags
95:09 - only have created on and created
95:11 - at like these two timestamps i have no
95:13 - idea what to use those for it looks like
95:16 - that is still in active development
95:18 - but really you just need to conceptually
95:20 - know what tags are and so tags are a way
95:23 - of tagging resources and allows you to
95:25 - use it for cost analysis
95:27 - [Music]
95:31 - so now we're going to look at the oracle
95:33 - service called cost analysis so oci cost
95:36 - analysis will help you visualize your
95:37 - ongoing costs you can filter based on
95:40 - compartments tagged resources and start
95:42 - and end date so if you're in your free
95:43 - tier if you use the service it will tell
95:45 - you how much of your
95:47 - credits that you have used up so far so
95:49 - um it's interesting because it's 300 usd
95:53 - but since we use canadian dollars
95:54 - it shows the canadian we get 400 so i
95:56 - feel like they're giving us a little bit
95:57 - more because they rounded it up to 400.
96:00 - uh and then if you want to get a
96:02 - breakdown of your service costs on the
96:04 - right-hand side they break it based on
96:05 - categories so compute storage networking
96:07 - and monitoring
96:09 - you can see the exact resource
96:10 - underneath and you get a nice little
96:12 - ticker graph there and as we said in the
96:15 - prior video you can use
96:17 - tags to help narrow down costs but that
96:19 - is the cost analysis service
96:24 - [Music]
96:26 - so now we're going to take a look at
96:27 - usage reports so if you want to get a
96:29 - granular view of your spending or find
96:31 - ways to save you can download a csv or
96:34 - use the oci api to access detailed
96:37 - billing information
96:38 - uh and so the cost report uh is
96:40 - automatically generated daily for you
96:42 - and it's stored in an oracle owned
96:45 - object storage bucket so you just go
96:47 - download that csv it's going to be based
96:49 - on that 24 hour history so just
96:52 - mentioning that 24 hours it generally
96:53 - contains 24 hours of data although
96:55 - occasionally a cost report may contain
96:57 - late arriving data that is older than 24
96:59 - hours
97:01 - um and if what would you do with the csv
97:03 - or the api data you'd have to put in
97:05 - your own visualization tool
97:07 - i mean cost analysis kind of visualizes
97:09 - your information for you but the idea of
97:11 - having this raw data is so that you can
97:13 - put it in your business intelligence
97:14 - tool whatever tool that you want to use
97:15 - for that but the fact is that you have
97:17 - access to that raw data
97:24 - so now let's look at the free tiers and
97:26 - the free tiers is what is going to be
97:27 - free so you can best utilize oracle
97:29 - before you want to start spending money
97:31 - so we have the always free
97:33 - and these are services that are always
97:35 - free month over month so let's talk
97:37 - about them right now so what you'll get
97:39 - is two oracle autonomous databases uh
97:41 - and again autonomous databases are great
97:43 - because they're self-healing uh they're
97:45 - highly scalable durable et cetera et
97:47 - so a really great database to choose
97:49 - then you have two oci compute vms
97:52 - at 180 cpus ocpus is a oracle term i'm
97:56 - not sure what it is but that's how they
97:58 - calculate cpus and one gigabyte then you
98:01 - have two block volumes for 100 gigabytes
98:03 - in total then you have object store up
98:05 - to 10 gigabytes then you have archive
98:07 - storage up to 10 gigabytes at one load
98:09 - balancer and uh all data in is free
98:12 - so now and then monitoring notifications
98:15 - and then also
98:16 - oci developers so this will automate ci
98:18 - cd workflows i don't know where this is
98:20 - in the interface but they
98:22 - they advertise it on their page and this
98:23 - would be amazing because not having to
98:25 - pay for a ci cd workflow sounds awesome
98:29 - then you have the 30 day free trial so
98:31 - when you sign up you get 300 usd credits
98:33 - if you're in canada apparently it's 400
98:36 - so that's really nice and it's only
98:37 - valid for 30 days so you get up to eight
98:39 - instances across all available services
98:42 - you get up to five terabytes of storage
98:44 - and those are the two things you want to
98:45 - remember on the tier
98:47 - now this isn't going to be on the exam
98:48 - but if you want to know the full list
98:50 - this is the full list so i actually went
98:52 - through it i was really curious so for
98:54 - compute
98:55 - you get 3005 hours 1.5 terabytes of
98:58 - storage for storage you get five
98:59 - terabytes
99:00 - for containers you get 3500 hours and
99:03 - two terabytes of storage for functions
99:05 - you get
99:06 - 112 uh invokes 20 uh million gigabytes
99:10 - memory second execution time for load
99:12 - bouncer you get 3500 hours
99:15 - for fast connect you get 1 400 hours for
99:17 - oracle weblogic server you get 1 700
99:20 - hours 250 gigabytes i have an asterisk
99:22 - there because they give you two
99:24 - versions of oracle weblogic server um uh
99:27 - one's like 650 hours
99:29 - but it wasn't clear what the difference
99:31 - was so i'm just listing one of them here
99:33 - if you want to use digital assistant
99:34 - which is a chat bot you get 110 000
99:36 - requests if you want to use mobile hub
99:38 - that's for building out web applications
99:40 - or mobile applications you get 110
99:42 - requests if you need a wysiwyg to edit a
99:45 - website you get 400 seven 4 700 hours if
99:49 - you want to use their business
99:50 - intelligence tool for analytics cloud
99:53 - you can use that for 4 700 hours if you
99:56 - want to use their machine learning
99:57 - platform for data science you can use
99:59 - that uh for 4 700 hours there
100:03 - if you want to have a web central portal
100:06 - so this is a secure enterprise portal
100:07 - you get a thousand ten hundred hours if
100:09 - you need application integration so
100:11 - using oc integrations there's 248 hours
100:14 - and if you need to use soa based apis
100:18 - which is super old but there's some
100:19 - enterprises still using it you get 1 700
100:21 - hours so all this isn't on the exam but
100:24 - it's great to know so you can best
100:25 - utilize the platform
100:28 - [Music]
100:32 - so now let's talk about the oracle
100:34 - marketplace so oracle marketplace are
100:36 - managed vm images or stacks from
100:38 - third-party vendors that are free or
100:40 - paid that you can launch
100:41 - so a third-party vendor you could be
100:43 - launching maybe rocketchat which is like
100:45 - a open source clone of slack maybe you
100:49 - need a gpu from nvidia um and there's
100:53 - security ones and all sorts of ones both
100:55 - from third party and even oracle
100:57 - themselves
100:58 - now if you want to know they can either
101:00 - be free or paid or bring your own
101:02 - license so there's a different few uh
101:04 - pricing options there and they have a
101:06 - lot of different categories so you can
101:07 - see analytics backup and data
101:10 - backup and recovery developer tools
101:12 - operating systems all sorts of things so
101:14 - if you really want to get started very
101:15 - quickly or you just
101:17 - you want to put the responsibility on
101:19 - someone else to manage those vms the
101:21 - oracle marketplace is a great place to
101:23 - take a look at
101:24 - [Music]
101:28 - so now we're going to take a look here
101:30 - at the oracle sla
101:32 - so sli stands for service level
101:34 - agreement and it's a guarantee of
101:35 - performance availability manageability
101:37 - of the of the oracle platform uh and
101:39 - oracle defines it as those three
101:41 - categories and if none of this makes
101:43 - sense don't worry we're gonna pull up
101:44 - the website to help
101:46 - understand a bit better so for the
101:48 - availability sla
101:50 - you have a 99.99 uptime for compute
101:53 - running in one ad region with
101:54 - measurements of regent unavailability uh
101:57 - we get 99.95
101:59 - uptime compute in multiple fds those are
102:02 - fault domains in a single ad
102:04 - availability domain and so for
102:06 - uh for the availability when we're
102:08 - looking at compute uh and notice it says
102:10 - 10 and 25 10 and 25 that is the sla
102:13 - breach i'm not exactly sure what it
102:14 - means but you need to know the numbers
102:17 - at least face value for the exam
102:19 - so for uh region unavailability you're
102:22 - going to see that it's 99.9
102:24 - for uh region unavailability for compute
102:26 - it's 99.9 but for block volumes it's 99
102:30 - and then uh for availability domains on
102:32 - availability at 10 and 25 we get that
102:35 - 99.95 percent and then 99 which is
102:37 - described up in the
102:39 - in that uh area above
102:41 - right
102:43 - now for some other services um under
102:45 - availability uh for object storage and
102:48 - fast connect it's 99.9 and 99 for 10 and
102:51 - 25 percent respectively you're gonna see
102:53 - those numbers repeated so there's just
102:55 - that one exception with computes that
102:57 - it's a bit more complicated now looking
102:59 - at the manageability slas uh what we
103:01 - have here for compute block volumes and
103:03 - databases is 99.9 for for sla breach of
103:06 - 10 percent and 99 for sla breach of 25
103:10 - percent then for performance slas uh for
103:13 - compute block volumes and database uh
103:16 - it's 99.9 for 10 percent and sla breach
103:19 - for 25 so you're seeing a bit of a
103:20 - pattern here so the thing i want you to
103:22 - remember is that if the sla breaches 10
103:24 - with the exception availability compute
103:26 - it's going to be 99.9 percent and for a
103:29 - breach of 25 it's going to be 99
103:32 - so you know just have that uh in
103:33 - consideration
103:36 - so here i am at the oracle website
103:38 - pulling up the sla agreements and i just
103:40 - wanted to show you um all these all the
103:43 - numbers that i was getting that
103:44 - information for you there so you can see
103:46 - that it's broken down by service then
103:48 - there are these measurements we didn't
103:49 - cover the measurements because they're
103:50 - not going to be not going to show up in
103:52 - the exam they're hard to remember
103:54 - and all you really need to know is like
103:56 - what at 10 or 25 percent what are the
103:58 - percentages that is the guarantee of
104:00 - uptime
104:02 - but you can see here for availability we
104:04 - have region unavailability availability
104:06 - domains api error rate for manageability
104:08 - it's all api error rate
104:10 - for performance it's disk iops and
104:12 - network performance
104:14 - and then there are some faqs here which
104:16 - should not show up on the exam
104:18 - but they are a bit interesting to read
104:19 - through if you are curious um but yeah
104:22 - there you go i just wanted to make sure
104:23 - that i could point this resource if you
104:24 - wanted to read a little bit more about
104:26 - it
104:26 - [Music]
104:31 - so let's talk about service limits for a
104:33 - moment here so when you sign up for oci
104:35 - a set of service limits is configured
104:37 - for your tenancy and the service limits
104:39 - is the quota or allowance of set on
104:41 - resources so you're going to actually
104:42 - have hard limits of how many servers you
104:44 - can spin up and utilize some things
104:47 - so for example your tendencies allow the
104:48 - maximum number of compute instances per
104:50 - ad a lot of times there's you can only
104:52 - have two
104:53 - um at the start especially when you're
104:54 - in your sandbox
104:56 - these limits are generally established
104:57 - with oracle sales representatives when
104:59 - you purchase oci if you do not establish
105:01 - limits with your oracle sales rep
105:04 - or if you signed up through the portal
105:05 - default or trial limits are set for your
105:07 - tenancy which is probably the case for
105:09 - you these limits may be increased for
105:11 - you automatically based on your oci
105:12 - resource usage and account standing you
105:14 - can request a service limit increase so
105:17 - that is the key thing you want to
105:18 - remember you can request a service limit
105:20 - increase if you cannot spin up more
105:22 - servers
105:23 - [Music]
105:27 - so let's talk about support for oci uh
105:30 - so from what i could tell they call it
105:31 - premier support uh and for the only part
105:35 - of information i thought was valuable to
105:37 - say was that uh they have rapid
105:38 - resolution for 24 7 access to the oracle
105:40 - knowledge base technical support and
105:43 - priority service request handling remote
105:45 - diagnostic with two-hour on-site
105:47 - hardware service um and if you're in the
105:49 - oracle console there is a live chat and
105:52 - i actually opened it up to ask what the
105:54 - support plans were and i literally was
105:56 - asked what do you mean and then they
105:57 - said
105:58 - you should go contact a sales rep to get
106:01 - a quote so
106:03 - it's strange because
106:05 - in the exam guide says you're supposed
106:06 - to know the support plans but the
106:08 - support plan is go call a support rep
106:10 - and i can't imagine anyone would do that
106:12 - so this is all that i know
106:14 - but we'll pull up the um
106:17 - support premiere page here in a moment
106:19 - just to see if we can see if there's
106:20 - anything else that is interesting to
106:21 - look at so i've gone here and i've
106:23 - opened up oracle support and this is the
106:26 - only support that i can find that is
106:27 - relevant to premiere
106:30 - or sorry to oracle cloud and so they say
106:32 - find out more about premiere support and
106:34 - then here we get a bunch of information
106:38 - that doesn't really tell us anything
106:40 - um
106:42 - you know there's software and systems
106:43 - and things like that
106:44 - so it's i'm not particularly sure um in
106:47 - terms of what they offer for support i
106:49 - imagine because they're enterprise you
106:50 - do have to call them and find out
106:53 - but yeah just if you are curious and you
106:55 - want to poke around and see if you can
106:56 - find something else that i didn't
106:59 - there you go
107:01 - [Music]
107:05 - so let's take a look at the shared
107:07 - security model and this is a very
107:08 - important concept to understand because
107:10 - it tells you what oracle is responsible
107:12 - for and what you the customer are
107:14 - responsible for in terms of securing
107:17 - your workloads and data so oci is going
107:19 - to be responsible for all the managed
107:21 - software and services that they offer so
107:23 - that could be compute uh storage
107:26 - databases and networking that is not the
107:28 - full spectrum of services but those are
107:30 - the the core four that i always say that
107:32 - uh is the ones that they are are
107:34 - responsible for then you have your
107:37 - hardware and your global infrastructure
107:38 - so the regions that are responsible for
107:41 - uh the data centers that are in there
107:43 - the availability domains those are the
107:44 - data centers themselves and then the
107:46 - physical security of those data centers
107:49 - um so you know if it's hardware or if
107:51 - it's the location or the it people that
107:54 - manage that infrastructure oci is going
107:56 - to take care of that for you now as the
107:58 - customer you are responsible for the
108:00 - configuration of managed services or
108:01 - third-party software so if you are using
108:05 - a particular platform or application or
108:07 - let's say you're creating
108:09 - new users
108:10 - or and you're giving them permissions in
108:12 - in iam it's your responsibility to
108:14 - configure those correctly and if you
108:16 - make a misconfiguration it's going to be
108:17 - on you
108:19 - then there's the configuration of the
108:20 - virtual infrastructure and systems so
108:22 - this could be the a virtual operating
108:24 - system that you have the virtual
108:26 - networking that you have to configure or
108:28 - the firewalls that you configure at your
108:30 - networking level
108:32 - then next we have security configuration
108:34 - of data so
108:36 - if you have data you have to decide
108:38 - whether you need to use client-side data
108:40 - encryption a lot of cloud services will
108:42 - let you
108:43 - check box that on
108:44 - and they might not be checked box on by
108:46 - default so that's something you have to
108:47 - double check then there's server side
108:49 - encryption then there is protecting your
108:52 - network traffic so that is putting uh
108:54 - services in control or monitoring tools
108:56 - to make sure that you're monitoring the
108:58 - traffic that is going through
109:00 - your environment
109:02 - and then last but not least but the most
109:04 - important is customer data you're
109:05 - responsible for the customer data so any
109:08 - data that you put on the platform you
109:10 - have to make sure that it is secure so
109:11 - that is the shared security model
109:15 - [Music]
109:19 - so now let's talk about iam so im stands
109:22 - for identity and access management and
109:24 - its a service that lets you control who
109:26 - has access to your cloud resources
109:29 - and so there are some components of iem
109:31 - that we need to know the first one are
109:33 - users so when you create your oracle
109:36 - account you're going to want to create
109:36 - users so people have access to your
109:38 - oracle resources so a user would be an
109:41 - individual employee or system that needs
109:42 - to manage or use oci resources then you
109:45 - have groups so groups is a collection of
109:47 - users who who all need the same type of
109:50 - access to set uh to to a set of
109:53 - resources or compartments then you have
109:55 - dynamic groups so dynamic groups is a
109:57 - special type of group that contains
109:59 - resources that match rules that you
110:00 - define if this is not clear don't worry
110:02 - we're going to go through
110:04 - how to make a policy and this will make
110:05 - it very clear
110:06 - and then we have policies so this is a
110:08 - language that defines permissions so if
110:10 - a user group or dynamic group or
110:12 - compartment should be allowed to access
110:14 - specific ocr resources within your
110:16 - account and one thing i want to note
110:18 - that if you've ever used any other cloud
110:19 - provider oci is a bit different in that
110:22 - you don't when you create a resource um
110:25 - or a user a group you don't assign at
110:27 - the time of creation a pre-created
110:30 - policy you just create the policy and
110:32 - it's in effect uh and this really
110:34 - confused me because i was looking
110:35 - forever in the console saying okay how
110:37 - do you sign it and so you just create
110:39 - the policy and it's in effect so
110:41 - hopefully that will be clear as we work
110:42 - our way through this stuff
110:44 - [Music]
110:49 - so what i want to do now to really help
110:50 - you understand i am policies i just want
110:53 - to show you some common examples of what
110:55 - that language would look like so this is
110:58 - the language or syntax so you have this
111:00 - allow subject to verb resource types in
111:02 - location where conditions and we're
111:04 - going to be going through all of these
111:06 - uh little bracketed areas so that you
111:08 - really understand but i just want to
111:10 - show you some common examples first
111:12 - so let's say you wanted to allow users
111:13 - to analyze the costs for your team so
111:16 - you do allow you would say the the
111:18 - budget team group is allowed to read
111:20 - only the usage reports which is the
111:22 - resource type in the tenancy so that's
111:24 - our root component uh next we have uh
111:27 - letting database admins manage db system
111:30 - so we're going to allow the database
111:31 - admin groups to manage the database
111:33 - family so any type of database within
111:36 - oracle
111:37 - in our tennessee or root account or root
111:39 - compartment
111:41 - then we have let users download objects
111:43 - from the object storage buckets so we're
111:45 - going to allow group object readers to
111:48 - read buckets in compartments in the
111:50 - compartment called a b whatever a b
111:52 - means uh so those are the common policy
111:55 - examples but i just want to show you
111:56 - that oracle has a huge list of policy
111:58 - examples on the on their website so i'm
112:00 - just going to pull that up here in a
112:02 - moment
112:03 - so here are those common policies i was
112:06 - talking about and i actually pulled
112:07 - those examples i showed you from this
112:09 - list so here's a big big list so if
112:11 - you're never sure
112:12 - what it is that you need to write in
112:14 - here you can go here so let's users
112:16 - create a volume group and they'll
112:17 - explain uh where to create the policy
112:20 - and what it would do but there's
112:21 - examples for you so i just wanted you to
112:23 - be aware that there was this big large
112:25 - list and all you had to do is google
112:27 - common policies to find it
112:34 - so i'm going to really help you
112:35 - understand how policies work
112:37 - by looking at the autonomy of a policy
112:39 - so what we're going to do is we're going
112:40 - to work through
112:42 - i don't know what they call those nouns
112:44 - or actions but all those brackets we're
112:46 - going to look at the examples of what we
112:47 - can do there so you have a better idea
112:49 - how you can use these policies do you
112:51 - have to know how to write policies for
112:53 - the exam no but it's a very good
112:56 - practical skill and it's good to learn
112:58 - it at the foundational level so that's
112:59 - why we're doing it so the first thing
113:01 - we're going to look at is the subject so
113:04 - a subject could be
113:06 - anything in your system so if you wanted
113:08 - to specify everything you do any user
113:11 - or you could specify i am group name or
113:13 - oc id so it could be group developers or
113:17 - group id and the oc id
113:19 - for
113:20 - that group that you want and then you
113:22 - could specify dynamic groups so it's the
113:25 - same thing as a group name you just say
113:28 - dynamic group tagged prod
113:31 - next we have verbs so a verb could be
113:34 - either inspect read use or manage and so
113:38 - if you want to only allow someone to
113:40 - list resources we would use inspect and
113:42 - oci recommends this is only for
113:44 - third-party auditors if you had uh only
113:47 - want to give people read access you do
113:49 - read and that would be generally for
113:51 - internal auditors if you wanted to give
113:53 - someone the ability to read and update
113:55 - but not delete or create resources you
113:57 - would use and that would be great for uh
113:59 - junior developers but they just say
114:00 - developers and if you want the ability
114:02 - to read create update or delete so be
114:05 - basically be able to do anything you
114:06 - would set it as manage and so that would
114:08 - be your administrators
114:10 - next we have resource types so if you
114:13 - want to specify all resource types you
114:15 - would just say all resources if you
114:17 - wanted to specify individual types such
114:20 - as only access to buckets or only access
114:22 - to route tables or only access to
114:25 - a particular type of servers than you do
114:28 - individual types but sometimes
114:30 - individual types can be a bit
114:32 - cumbersome so you might want to include
114:35 - everything uh within a category which
114:37 - they call family so maybe you want to
114:39 - say all types of databases or all types
114:41 - of servers or all types of storage
114:44 - volume so database family would be all
114:46 - databases there that you could put in
114:47 - there
114:48 - next would be the location so uh this
114:51 - could be the tenancy so that's your
114:52 - route com compartment
114:55 - maybe you want to specify a single
114:56 - compartment such as compartment
114:58 - development or compartment production
115:01 - or maybe you want to specify based on
115:03 - the compartment's oc id
115:06 - and then last is conditions and we have
115:08 - a lot of options here for conditions so
115:10 - we could match based on a string so we
115:12 - could say where target group dot name
115:14 - equals staging
115:15 - you could say you could match based on a
115:17 - regex so we only want to match target
115:19 - groups that have a customer
115:22 - and then we have not so
115:24 - this could be target group name so as
115:26 - long as it's not beta then we won't use
115:28 - the beta one
115:29 - then you can do it all so that's where
115:30 - you can actually have multiple
115:32 - statements condition statements so you
115:34 - have one where it's it's developer but
115:35 - you don't want to be production
115:38 - and then you have any so this could be
115:40 - when any of the statements are true so
115:42 - if you don't want it to be project a and
115:43 - we don't want it to be project b so
115:45 - maybe we wanted to be project c so you
115:47 - know hopefully that gives you a bit of
115:48 - an idea on how to uh construct a policy
115:52 - but you know to really understand you're
115:53 - gonna have to get some practical
115:54 - knowledge in there
115:58 - [Music]
116:00 - so now let's talk about mfa and mfa is
116:02 - short for multi-factor authentication it
116:05 - is a security control where after you
116:07 - fill in your username email
116:09 - and password you have to use a second
116:11 - device such as a phone to confirm that
116:13 - it's you logging in why would you want
116:15 - this well mfa protects against people
116:16 - who have stolen your password so if
116:18 - someone gets your username and password
116:20 - how would you know that like how does
116:22 - the system know if it's actually you and
116:24 - so this additional step when you're
116:25 - dealing with cloud infrastructure you
116:27 - definitely want to have mfa turned on
116:29 - and you can turn mfa on in most
116:32 - platforms so
116:34 - whether it's you're using aws oracle gcp
116:37 - or even if you're using facebook you can
116:39 - turn it on so the way it works is uh you
116:42 - have your uh your login so
116:44 - my my email my password and then what
116:47 - you do is you have a an app installed on
116:49 - your phone that is for mfa and it would
116:51 - give you a code so the code here would
116:53 - be 439 691 and you'd have to enter that
116:57 - code back into like as a second step
117:00 - after your login and that would make
117:01 - sure 100 percent that it is you who is
117:04 - logging in because the person who stole
117:06 - your password doesn't have your phone so
117:08 - they don't have
117:09 - that second factor so the first factor
117:12 - is your email and the second factor
117:14 - could be a device such as your phone
117:17 - that has mfa installed on it another
117:19 - device you could use is called an ubi
117:21 - key and so if you've ever turned on mfa
117:24 - on facebook it's really annoying because
117:26 - you have to pull up your phone unless
117:27 - you're already on your phone um but a
117:29 - newbie key is is looks like this little
117:31 - flash drive and you leave it plugged in
117:33 - your computer and it automatically
117:34 - enters in the second step for you so
117:36 - that it's just as easy as logging in
117:40 - and the great thing about this key is
117:41 - you can just take it with use uh so a
117:43 - lot of people will put it around their
117:44 - neck on a chain but that is what mfa is
117:48 - [Music]
117:53 - so now we're going to look at the
117:54 - concept of federation so federation
117:56 - identity is the ability to enable users
117:58 - from one domain to securely access data
118:00 - or systems of another domain without the
118:02 - need of a redundant user administrator
118:04 - if you're looking at that word domain
118:05 - and wondering what it means domain could
118:07 - just mean like your office and then
118:10 - another domain would be like oracle
118:11 - cloud so the idea is that um your office
118:15 - has given you a username and password to
118:17 - log in to
118:19 - your your your office network and you
118:21 - want to use those credentials other
118:23 - places so let's give an example as to
118:25 - why this would be useful so if you're a
118:27 - large company and you purchase multiple
118:29 - commercial and enterprise software
118:30 - products or services such as oracle
118:32 - cloud wouldn't it be convenient if the
118:34 - employee only had to log into their work
118:36 - computer and they had access to all
118:38 - these software products and services
118:40 - without having to log it again that
118:42 - concept is called single sign-on so
118:44 - single sign-on is technology that
118:45 - enables users to authenticate without
118:47 - the need to log in or have separate pair
118:50 - of credentials to third-party systems
118:52 - another concept we need to know is idp
118:55 - so identity
118:57 - identity provider so identity provider
119:00 - is a trusted provider of your user
119:02 - identity that lets you authenticate to
119:03 - access other services so identity
119:06 - provider could be microsoft active
119:07 - directory if you're in the enterprise
119:09 - world you've definitely heard of active
119:10 - directory also abbreviated as ad
119:13 - uh okata octa i don't know how to
119:15 - pronounce it but that is an enterprise
119:17 - identity provider but even facebook is
119:20 - an identity provider if you've ever went
119:22 - on a website that says log in with
119:23 - facebook that's an identity provider
119:25 - facebook is providing your identity so
119:27 - that you can gain access to things other
119:29 - ones could be amazon google
119:31 - twitter github linkedin and even oracle
119:33 - has their own it's called oracle
119:35 - identity cloud service so those are the
119:38 - three things you need to understand what
119:39 - is the federation identity single
119:40 - sign-on and on an idp
119:44 - [Music]
119:48 - so let's talk about
119:50 - encryption or security for the storage
119:52 - of our data and so for data we have
119:54 - block volume file storage
119:57 - object storage and then any database
119:59 - service um and so let's walk through
120:01 - this stuff so for block volumes
120:04 - uh by default we're gonna get encryption
120:06 - at rest so if you create a block volume
120:07 - file storage or object storage your data
120:09 - at rest is already encrypted so that's
120:11 - data that's just sitting on that drive
120:14 - on the server it's encrypted then you
120:15 - have encryption and transit that means
120:17 - when
120:18 - the data leaves the actual
120:22 - storage device to go to a server
120:24 - whatever is that traffic encrypted by
120:26 - default and it is for block volume and
120:29 - file storage
120:30 - uh you can also bring your own keys so
120:32 - uh the thing is is that for encryption
120:34 - at rest or in transit you're going to be
120:36 - using some kind of encryption key but if
120:38 - you have you want to bring your own you
120:40 - can definitely do that for block volume
120:43 - and file storage
120:45 - and then for object storage if you want
120:47 - to
120:48 - also be able to secure your buckets
120:50 - buckets is what they call folders for
120:52 - object storage
120:53 - you can make a private bucket
120:56 - and then for database services is a bit
120:57 - different they have tde data safe and
121:00 - database vault and if you're wondering
121:01 - what those are we'll talk about them
121:02 - right away so tde is transparent data
121:05 - encryption it's a technology employed by
121:07 - microsoft ibm and oracle to encrypt
121:09 - database files then you have oracle data
121:12 - safe is it's a security control that
121:14 - monitors sensitive data such as oci
121:16 - databases so it's not exclusive to the
121:18 - database service but our database
121:20 - services but that's what we generally
121:22 - use it for and then you have oracle
121:24 - database vault so this restricts access
121:25 - to specific areas in your oracle
121:27 - database from any user including users
121:30 - who have administrative access so there
121:32 - you go and we'll talk a little bit more
121:34 - about data safe things
121:35 - [Music]
121:40 - so we briefly mentioned at rest and in
121:42 - transit encryption but i didn't really
121:43 - explain to you what those are so let me
121:45 - tell you what they are right now so
121:47 - address encryption address encryption is
121:48 - securing data that is not moving
121:50 - encrypting a hard drive would be
121:52 - considered at rest encryption so you'd
121:54 - use something like the key pair to
121:55 - encrypt your data and a cryptographic
121:57 - algorithm such as ae256
122:00 - but the key thing i want you to take
122:01 - away is that at rest encryption is when
122:03 - you're securing data when it's not
122:05 - moving then there's in-transit
122:07 - encryption and this is ensuring your
122:08 - data uh that while it's moving from
122:11 - location to another location that it's
122:12 - secure and if you're using in-transit
122:15 - encryption a protocol like ssl http or
122:17 - tls would be used ssl is very common if
122:20 - you've ever seen that little lock in
122:23 - your web browser that is using ssl so
122:26 - there you go those two terms
122:30 - [Music]
122:32 - so let's talk about um oracle's data
122:34 - safe uh service so oracle data save is a
122:37 - unified control center for your oracle
122:39 - databases and what it looks like is this
122:41 - it's a bunch of graphs and it gives you
122:42 - a very clear picture of the security um
122:45 - of your actual uh databases so some
122:48 - things that it can do it helps you
122:49 - understand the sensitivity of your data
122:52 - evaluate risks
122:54 - to your data mass
122:56 - if you need to mask sensitive data you
122:57 - can do that you can implement and
122:59 - monitor security controls it has access
123:02 - or assesses user security it monitors
123:04 - user activity and addresses compliance
123:07 - requirements so this is very interesting
123:09 - because i've yet to see such a service
123:12 - on aws or other providers uh so you know
123:15 - oracle is known for databases and so
123:16 - this is one of the the stronger services
123:19 - they have uh in their uh in their cloud
123:22 - so you know that's data
123:26 - [Music]
123:28 - so let's talk about compliance programs
123:30 - so if you want to sell to an enterprise
123:32 - company or a government uh uh body they
123:36 - will not buy your software unless it is
123:38 - secure and so the question i pose to you
123:41 - is how are you going to meet their
123:42 - security compliance requirements
123:44 - so they'll say we'll only do business
123:46 - with you if you are
123:47 - nist 853 compliant so that would be the
123:50 - icon there
123:51 - p-i-p-e-d-a compliant that is a
123:54 - government compliance program or hipaa
123:56 - compliant so hipaa would be um
124:00 - if you want to do medicine it stands for
124:02 - health something something american
124:05 - something
124:06 - and then you have fips 140 hyphen 2
124:08 - compliant and this is the way you handle
124:11 - encryption keys uh so the idea is that
124:13 - there's all these compliance programs
124:15 - and uh oci is compliant with them so if
124:18 - you do need to meet these comp
124:20 - compliance programs to get the business
124:22 - with the governments or large
124:23 - enterprises
124:25 - that is one of the strong advantages of
124:27 - the cloud and i'll see if i can pull up
124:28 - a page that shows all the compliance
124:30 - programs on their website
124:32 - so here i'm on the oracle website here i
124:35 - just search for compliance programs or
124:36 - up here it says cloud infrastructure
124:38 - compliance and these are all the
124:40 - compliance programs that they are
124:42 - meeting on their platforms so their
124:44 - infrastructure meets those requirements
124:45 - so we have sock system organization
124:47 - controls one two three uh we have one
124:50 - for the united kingdom cloud security
124:51 - principles there's that canadian one we
124:54 - saw
124:54 - um they have a bunch so hip uh hipaa so
124:57 - health insurance portability and
124:58 - accountability act i thought one was
124:59 - called amer american in there but it is
125:01 - an american act
125:03 - then we have gdpr
125:05 - you or we have fedramp but you don't
125:07 - need to know the names of all these it's
125:09 - good to know what hipaa is it's good to
125:11 - know um
125:13 - what dci uh pci dess payment card
125:18 - industry data security standards so if
125:19 - you're handling
125:21 - um credit cards online you generally
125:23 - need to be pci dss compliant um but yeah
125:26 - this is just and i just showing you all
125:28 - these compliance programs and i feel
125:30 - like you could expand this and it would
125:31 - tell you a bit more it'll tell you what
125:33 - the program is about and what
125:35 - infrastructure actually is meeting those
125:37 - requirements
125:38 - so hopefully that gives you an idea what
125:40 - compliance programs are and why you care
125:43 - should care about them
125:48 - so let's talk about oci vault so oc
125:50 - vault makes it easy for you to create
125:52 - and control rotate encryption keys used
125:54 - to encrypt data on oci
125:57 - oci vault was previously known as oci
125:59 - key management or i think they
126:00 - abbreviate it as kms uh at least that's
126:03 - what i think so just be aware if we're
126:05 - talking about vault or key management
126:07 - it's the same thing oci vault is a
126:10 - multi-tenant cloud hsm if you're
126:12 - wondering what an hsm is hsm stands for
126:15 - hardware security module it's a piece of
126:17 - hardware designed to store encryption
126:19 - keys
126:20 - and uh the reason why you want to use a
126:23 - cloud hsm or a hardware security module
126:26 - is that it meets a compliance program
126:27 - such as fips 140 hyphen 2. so we talked
126:31 - about compliance programs prior and this
126:33 - would be a way to be compliant with this
126:35 - program um and so
126:38 - and yeah the key thing here is that it's
126:39 - multi-tenant so that means multiple
126:40 - customers are sharing the cost if you
126:42 - had to buy that piece of hardware
126:43 - outright it's at least a thousand
126:45 - dollars just for the hardware so you can
126:47 - see how this is extremely cost effective
126:49 - using oci vault and you're still
126:51 - compliant
126:53 - [Music]
126:58 - so let's talk about os management so os
127:00 - management is a oracle service that
127:02 - allows you to manage update and patch
127:04 - your virtual machines operating systems
127:06 - running on uh your oracle cloud so i
127:10 - like to think of os management as a
127:12 - toolbox for your vms so that's an easy
127:14 - way to remember what it is so let's talk
127:15 - about the features of os management and
127:17 - what it can do for you
127:19 - so
127:19 - one thing you can do is it can search
127:21 - install and remove linux packages for
127:23 - you
127:24 - it can uh search a faculty
127:27 - or a facility that you can use to check
127:29 - individual cve so common vulnerabilities
127:31 - and exposures to determine level
127:32 - exposure in your tenancy uh so exposure
127:35 - meaning like as someone trying to
127:37 - do malicious
127:39 - things like trying to exploit
127:42 - security vulnerabilities within your vms
127:45 - then you have software sources this is
127:47 - specific to linux but you can add or
127:48 - delete software sources to provide
127:50 - packages to instances to track available
127:52 - updates to those packages so it's not
127:54 - necessarily the installation or removing
127:56 - or searching packages it's the the
127:58 - sources of those packages then you have
128:01 - managed instance groups this enables you
128:02 - to group your instances together for
128:04 - updates uh the purpose of this would be
128:06 - like let's say you want to apply patches
128:08 - to this
128:09 - set of servers you can do that you can
128:11 - schedule jobs so you can execute one
128:13 - time
128:14 - a single job so let's say you wanted to
128:16 - download the application logs because
128:17 - you need to debug a problem on your
128:19 - production server then you have work
128:21 - requests this is just like scheduled
128:23 - jobs so you execute a job but it's based
128:24 - on a schedule so maybe every every day
128:27 - you want to back up some very specific
128:29 - system files and the last thing is
128:31 - you're going to get metrics and alarms
128:32 - you can create alarms such as when it's
128:34 - time to apply a security update so that
128:36 - is os management
128:38 - [Music]
128:43 - so let's talk about ddos protection on
128:45 - oci so before we do let's make sure we
128:48 - understand what ddos is so a ddos attack
128:50 - is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal
128:52 - traffic by flooding a website with large
128:55 - amounts of fake traffic and so i have a
128:57 - nice little diagram to show you here so
128:59 - imagine you have a server
129:01 - and imagine it's not on oracle or any
129:03 - other cloud providers just
129:05 - you have it somewhere hosted and
129:07 - somebody decides that they want to
129:08 - attack you they want to flood you with a
129:10 - bunch of traffic so they have their own
129:12 - server
129:12 - you don't know where it is but they have
129:14 - that server and what they do
129:16 - is they can control multiple remote
129:18 - servers
129:19 - which we might call slaves
129:21 - and what these servers are going to do
129:22 - is they're going to
129:23 - send fake traffic so they're going to
129:25 - pretend each server could pretend that
129:27 - they're a thousand people and so if you
129:29 - have a you know
129:31 - 20 servers pertaining they're each a
129:32 - thousand then you send out all those
129:35 - fake uh traffic uh over the internet and
129:38 - as it goes over the internet it's a bit
129:39 - harder to figure out where that
129:40 - traffic's coming from and all those ip
129:42 - addresses are spoofed anyway so we have
129:44 - no idea
129:45 - if the ips are really real and then you
129:47 - get that flood of traffic and when you
129:48 - get all that traffic hitting your server
129:51 - it makes it to become unavailable
129:53 - becomes unavailable because it can't
129:54 - handle
129:55 - the amount of traffic that's coming in
129:57 - it's like imagine you're getting lots of
129:59 - phone calls you can only handle so much
130:01 - at a given time
130:02 - um and so you so real users can't reach
130:04 - your website and that's what a ddos
130:06 - attack is but by having
130:09 - your server just within oci on the oci
130:11 - network you automatically uh get
130:14 - built-in support for ddos protection so
130:17 - there's different types of ddos so for
130:19 - layers three and four it's going to
130:21 - protect a guns flood attacks for layer
130:23 - seven you'd use a waff or some other
130:25 - tools we're not going to talk about the
130:27 - layers too much here but i just want you
130:29 - to know that there's built-in ddos
130:30 - protection when you use your server on
130:33 - oci
130:35 - [Music]
130:39 - so let's take a look at what a web
130:41 - application firewall does so oci has
130:43 - their own it's called oci waff and that
130:46 - protects your web app against common web
130:48 - exploits so oseiwaf sits between your
130:51 - server and incoming traffic and filters
130:53 - out https traffic um this is known as
130:56 - layer 7. i know i'm not talking too much
130:58 - about the layers you just need to know
131:00 - that it's layer 7 and it decides that it
131:02 - is unwanted based on managed or custom
131:04 - configured rules so
131:07 - oci has rules that are going to say this
131:09 - is bad traffic or you can set your own
131:11 - and so here's an architectural diagram
131:12 - you have a server sitting in your vcn a
131:14 - virtual cloud network and then you have
131:16 - oci
131:17 - sitting in between the incoming traffic
131:19 - and the traffic that's supposed to reach
131:21 - your server and it's going to decide if
131:22 - it's good or bad based on those rules
131:25 - now if you're wondering like what are
131:26 - good rules for waff
131:29 - like to filter on generally they follow
131:31 - owasp's top ten so you might have never
131:34 - heard of a wasp their logo is a wasp but
131:37 - it stands for the open web application
131:39 - security project so this is a project
131:42 - that is from a non-profit organization
131:45 - and what they've done is they've
131:46 - detailed all the possible common attacks
131:48 - that can happen and how to prevent them
131:50 - and so that is the basis of the majority
131:53 - of waffs out there whether it's oracle
131:55 - or any other they'll always go back to
131:57 - this list
131:58 - but this really gives you a clear idea
132:00 - as to what you need to protect against
132:02 - so there you go that is wab
132:04 - [Music]
132:09 - all right so i'm going to show you how
132:10 - to get started by setting up your first
132:11 - oracle cloud account so what i want you
132:14 - to do is in the top right corner go to
132:16 - try oracle cloud free tier there might
132:18 - be another button somewhere else but
132:19 - we'll go here and then we'll hit start
132:22 - for uh start for free
132:24 - and then it's going to ask us to choose
132:26 - our country i am in canada so we will
132:29 - type in canada here and then we'll
132:31 - choose our email i'm going to choose
132:33 - android exam pro.co i'm not sure if i've
132:35 - already made an account but i guess
132:36 - we'll find out
132:38 - it's going to ask us between a company
132:40 - and a and personal use
132:42 - i'm going to stick with personal use i'm
132:43 - going to say exam pro
132:47 - uh and then we'll drop down and we get
132:49 - to choose our region um we could choose
132:52 - uh
132:53 - well we want to do the free tier i guess
132:55 - it's only free for particular tiers even
132:57 - though i'm in canada toronto i'm going
132:58 - to choose ashburn this is where the most
133:01 - available
133:02 - servers are going to be
133:04 - and then i need to fill out my account
133:06 - information
133:08 - um so i'm just going to go here and fill
133:10 - all that out okay
133:13 - okay and so now all my uh personal
133:15 - details are filled in here um you're not
133:17 - gonna be able to see them because i
133:18 - blank them out and we'll go ahead and
133:20 - we'll verify our phone number
133:22 - so we now just have to enter in the code
133:25 - that it has given us so i'm just gonna
133:27 - check my phone here to see if
133:29 - i received a code and i have so i'm just
133:32 - going to go ahead and fill that in
133:34 - so that's 1 4
133:36 - 9 5
133:39 - 0 2 4.
133:42 - go ahead and verify that code
133:45 - and so now we need to put in a password
133:47 - so i'm just going to go ahead and fill
133:49 - in a password
133:54 - great and so now that i meet all the
133:55 - password requirements i should go ahead
133:57 - here and go to payment information
134:00 - and i hear it's just saying that i need
134:02 - to add a credit card but i won't be
134:04 - charged unless i'd like to upgrade my
134:05 - account so go ahead and i'll go and add
134:08 - my credit card and so here we can see my
134:10 - payment information is being repeated so
134:12 - i'm just going to scroll down and so now
134:14 - we need to choose a payment type so i'm
134:15 - just going to fill that in
134:16 - and now i have that filled in i'm just
134:18 - going to hit finish
134:20 - and so now we're just going to get a
134:21 - confirmation here so i'm going to hit
134:23 - confirm
134:30 - and so now this has created my account
134:32 - so i can go ahead and just log in with
134:34 - my password so we'll go ahead and log in
134:50 - and here we are we're in my account so
134:52 - this is the oracle console and you can
134:53 - see that we're under a trial for 30 days
134:56 - and if we we can upgrade to get access
134:57 - to more things
134:59 - so there you go so that that's all it
135:01 - takes to create an account
135:05 - [Music]
135:09 - so one of the first things we should do
135:11 - in our account is set up mfa so i'm
135:13 - going to set up mfa for my root account
135:15 - here so what we'll do is we'll go to the
135:17 - top right corner here go to profile
135:19 - we're going to go to user settings
135:21 - and we have this button here this is
135:22 - enable multi-factor authentication i'm
135:24 - going to go ahead and click that
135:28 - and what that's going to do it's going
135:29 - to give us this qr code and so
135:31 - what you're going to need is you're
135:32 - going to install the oracle mobile
135:34 - authenticator or a similar application i
135:37 - believe you can use google's
135:38 - authenticator but this is a separate
135:40 - application you have to install on your
135:42 - phone so you have to go to the google
135:44 - play store
135:45 - or or whichever
135:47 - or whichever store is on your phone and
135:50 - so i'm just pulling mine up right now so
135:52 - i have authenticator
135:54 - and in authenticator i i can click um a
135:58 - plus button
135:59 - it says scan a barcode
136:01 - and i'm just going to hold up my phone
136:03 - to that barcode and then it's going to
136:05 - add it
136:06 - and so now it's had it's now added it
136:08 - and it's going to ask me to enter in the
136:10 - numbers i see on my phone so i'm going
136:12 - to enter it in so i got
136:14 - 421908 and i'm going to hit enter
136:17 - and now i have multi-factor
136:18 - authentication so the next time i log in
136:21 - to my account i'm going to have to use
136:23 - authenticator
136:24 - to enter in those numbers
136:27 - so my account is secure and that's how
136:28 - you set up mfa
136:30 - if you have a business account it's a
136:31 - little bit different and i think we do
136:33 - have instructions on that on our website
136:36 - but yeah for your personal account
136:37 - that's all you have to do to set up mfa
136:43 - [Music]
136:47 - so now we're going to look at setting up
136:49 - a user account within our oracle cloud
136:52 - so if you aren't on this home screen
136:54 - just always click the logo oracle cloud
136:56 - here uh if you are
136:58 - lost from the last video
137:01 - what i want you to do is open the
137:02 - hamburger menu
137:04 - go down to identity and go to users
137:07 - and so what we can do is we can add more
137:09 - users to our account so i'm going to hit
137:11 - create users i'm going to make one for
137:13 - baker who's my co-founder he's also
137:15 - named andrew
137:16 - so that's why we call him
137:18 - bako from his last name
137:22 - and i need to confirm the email
137:26 - um
137:33 - i guess you can't have a space
137:37 - we'll look at some advanced options we
137:38 - can tag him we'll go ahead here and
137:40 - create oh i'll just say co-founder
137:45 - and so now i've created a bacon account
137:48 - and i'll just click into him here
137:49 - and he's never logged in but we can
137:51 - enable mfa for him but i guess he would
137:53 - have to do it himself because he would
137:55 - have to add his phone
137:56 - we can
137:57 - create and reset his password we can
138:00 - edit him as a user some basic
138:01 - information so that's how easy it is to
138:03 - create a user so we'll just go back here
138:05 - to oracle cloud and we'll move on to the
138:07 - next step
138:09 - [Music]
138:14 - so now that we have a user let's go
138:15 - ahead and uh put them in a group so
138:17 - we'll go up to the hamburger menu go
138:19 - back down to identity we'll go to groups
138:22 - and we'll create a group and we're going
138:23 - to call this group developers
138:26 - and maybe we'll capitalize it because
138:27 - our other one has a capital on it
138:29 - doesn't matter so these are developer
138:31 - group
138:33 - and we'll go ahead here and create that
138:35 - group so now we have created that group
138:37 - let's go ahead and add baco
138:39 - to that developer group so i'll click in
138:41 - here and then we'll just hit add user to
138:42 - group
138:43 - and we'll choose our user so we'll
138:45 - choose baco
138:46 - and i'll hit add and so now they're
138:48 - added to that group and the reason why
138:50 - we want to add people to groups is so
138:51 - that we can apply policies so that they
138:53 - have limitations on what they can do
138:55 - within the platform but we'll go back to
138:57 - oracle cloud and that's all you have to
138:59 - do to create a
139:01 - [Music]
139:04 - group so now let's go ahead and create a
139:07 - compartment a compartment allows us to
139:10 - group resources together and apply
139:12 - permissions just like how groups allow
139:13 - us to apply permissions to users so go
139:16 - back up to the hamburger menu go down to
139:18 - identity and choose compartments
139:20 - we already have a compartment it's our
139:22 - root compartment it's named after our
139:24 - account but we want to make our our own
139:25 - so we'll hit create compartment we'll
139:28 - call it development
139:29 - we'll have to give it a description as
139:30 - development again it's going to be the
139:33 - parents going to be uh the the root one
139:36 - because you can nest these six levels
139:37 - down but we just need one we'll go ahead
139:40 - and hit create compartment so now we've
139:42 - created ourselves a compartment and
139:43 - that's all we had to do here so let's go
139:45 - back to oracle cloud
139:46 - and we'll move on to the next
139:49 - [Music]
139:53 - so now let's go ahead and create a
139:55 - policy a policy is going to help us
139:58 - limit access to resources so people
140:00 - don't have access to things they
140:01 - shouldn't have
140:02 - so what i want you to do is go back up
140:04 - to the hamburger menu go down to
140:05 - identity and then what we're going to do
140:08 - is we're going to choose policies
140:10 - now policies are interesting because the
140:11 - way they are applied is that you don't
140:13 - apply you don't make a policy and then
140:15 - say assign to user as soon as you make
140:18 - them they're assigned
140:21 - so now that we're here
140:23 - we need to choose a compartment so it
140:25 - says view and manage pick a compartment
140:26 - resource type so we'll drop this down
140:28 - here
140:31 - oh over here and we're going to choose
140:33 - um
140:35 - example root
140:36 - and we're going to go ahead and create
140:38 - ourselves a new policy
140:39 - so i'm going to name this policy i'm
140:42 - going to say developer access
140:45 - so we'll see developers
140:47 - and now we need to write our statement
140:49 - and so i have a statement here i'm just
140:50 - gonna write it out so we're gonna say
140:52 - allow group developers
140:55 - to manage
140:56 - all resources
140:58 - in compartment
141:00 - development
141:02 - and so if i name that all right i
141:04 - believe i gave that a capital d i don't
141:05 - know if it's case sensitive and we're
141:07 - going to go ahead there and create that
141:09 - policy
141:10 - and so that's all it takes to make a a
141:12 - policy uh and to really test it uh you
141:14 - know baker would have to use this
141:16 - account and he would have to see if he
141:17 - had access or if he didn't i believe
141:19 - that when you make new user accounts by
141:21 - default they don't have any access until
141:23 - they are part of the statement group so
141:25 - everything is deny by default and then
141:27 - you add things to allow but that's all
141:29 - it takes to create a policy we're gonna
141:31 - go back to oracle cloud and we're done
141:32 - with this section
141:34 - [Music]
141:38 - so in order for us to launch resources
141:40 - uh in oracle we're going to need a vcn
141:44 - and so what we're going to do is go up
141:46 - to the hamburger menu make our way over
141:48 - to networking and go to vcns which
141:50 - stands for virtual cloud networks and we
141:52 - have two options we can create a vcn
141:53 - from scratch or we can start a start one
141:56 - with the vcn wizard i'm going to use the
141:58 - wizard and so we have two options vcm
142:00 - with internet connectivity or vcm with
142:02 - internet connectivity site to site vpn
142:04 - connect this sounds really great if we
142:06 - had something a bit more complicated
142:08 - like connecting to an on-premise network
142:10 - as the image shows but we want something
142:12 - simple here so i'm going to hit start
142:13 - vcn wizard and that's going to create us
142:15 - a bunch of resources so we'll just name
142:17 - our vcn as myvcn
142:20 - it's automatically filled in us a cider
142:22 - block so we have 10.0.0.16
142:26 - and then what we have here is the
142:27 - subnets so it's going to create as a
142:29 - public subnet and a private subnet and
142:32 - as you remember from
142:34 - my tutorial guide uh you always want
142:37 - your subnets to cider block to be
142:38 - smaller than your vcn because it's
142:41 - taking a slice out of it now it looks
142:43 - confusing because 24 is larger than 16
142:46 - but the larger the number is the smaller
142:48 - the slice okay
142:50 - and then we'll just scroll on down here
142:52 - so it says dns resolution we definitely
142:54 - want that we'll just scroll down uh this
142:56 - all looks great and we'll go ahead and
142:58 - hit next but before we do just look it's
143:00 - going to create us a vcn a public subnet
143:02 - a private subnet the internet gateway a
143:04 - nat gateway and a service gateway
143:07 - so we'll go ahead and hit next
143:09 - and then we'll go ahead and hit create
143:11 - so we'll just wait for those to create
143:14 - and so there you go they're all have
143:15 - been created so we'll go view virtual
143:17 - cloud network
143:19 - and so now we have our own vcn where we
143:21 - can start launching resources within and
143:23 - that's going to allow us to set up our
143:25 - own server so i'm going to go up here to
143:27 - oracle cloud and that's what we'll do
143:29 - we'll launch a server next
143:33 - [Music]
143:35 - so what we're going to do now is set up
143:37 - our own server so what i want you to do
143:39 - is go to the hamburger menu at the top
143:41 - we're going to go to compute we're going
143:42 - to go to instances we're going to create
143:45 - ourselves a new instance
143:47 - now it gives us a randomly generated
143:48 - name which is fine we can choose the os
143:50 - that we want so the oracle has their own
143:52 - version of linux if we hit change we
143:54 - have a bunch of options we can choose
143:56 - from such as partner images or maybe you
143:59 - have your custom images
144:00 - but we're just going to stick with the
144:02 - oracle version
144:04 - then in order for us to launch this
144:06 - we're going to actually need to upload
144:08 - an ssh key but before we do that let's
144:09 - just look at some of the options here so
144:11 - we can change the availability domain
144:13 - we can choose the size of instance they
144:16 - call them shapes so if we open up change
144:18 - shape
144:19 - we have different sizes
144:21 - we can even choose
144:22 - the provider for the
144:25 - for that you can choose bare metal if
144:27 - you want or go virtual
144:30 - and we're not we might not be seeing all
144:31 - the options because we are in the trial
144:33 - account so if we upgrade we probably
144:34 - would see
144:36 - a lot more options
144:38 - but what we'll do
144:39 - we'll just hide that there and what we
144:41 - need is we need a
144:42 - private and public key and this is a
144:44 - little bit hard because oracle doesn't
144:46 - give you a button just to generate them
144:47 - here so what you have to do is you have
144:49 - to create your own key pair and they do
144:50 - have this nice page on how to do whether
144:52 - you're on windows
144:54 - or if you're on um
144:56 - on linux or mac so i'm right now i'm on
144:59 - a windows machine so i would have to use
145:01 - putty so you'd have to go ahead and
145:03 - install putty once you've installed it
145:05 - you'd search for puttygen
145:08 - and again all these instructions are
145:10 - here so if you are a bit lost look for
145:12 - creating a key pair under the oracle
145:15 - cloud infrastructure documentation
145:18 - and it's under the getting started
145:19 - section okay
145:21 - but here i have uh putty
145:23 - and
145:24 - what it wants it wants us to create an
145:26 - ssh
145:28 - to rsa
145:30 - so it says find it okay specify a type
145:33 - of key
145:35 - so in the key menu
145:37 - confirm the default is rsa ssh key
145:41 - and this is a bit confusing because i'm
145:43 - looking at putty right here right now
145:46 - oh i had an old one open
145:48 - and i'm not seeing that so oh i guess
145:50 - you drop it down from there so it says
145:51 - ssh hyphen 2 rsa key
145:55 - type
145:57 - for the type of key generate accept the
145:59 - default key value as rsa so that's
146:01 - what's set as set the number of bits
146:03 - generated to 2048 so it's already set to
146:05 - 240048
146:07 - and then click generate then when you
146:09 - need to move your mouse a bit that
146:10 - actually helps it generate random data
146:13 - and then it's going to say so it says
146:15 - move your mouse around when the key is
146:17 - generated
146:18 - appears under the public key for pacing
146:20 - ossh so it's just talking about that
146:23 - leave the key the passphrase blank we're
146:25 - going to do that
146:26 - save the private
146:27 - key and click yes
146:29 - um
146:31 - and then the key pair saved and putty
146:32 - which will be proprietary you can name
146:34 - the key anything you want it's ppka
146:36 - select all the generated keys and
146:38 - appears under the public key for pasting
146:39 - ossh
146:41 - do not save the public key because it
146:42 - does not save the key in the open ssh
146:44 - format okay
146:46 - so we'll go ahead and we will save our
146:47 - private key
146:49 - and we'll say yes because it's okay if
146:51 - we leave it blank we'll go to desktop
146:54 - i'm just going to name this as um
146:57 - oracle exam pro and it's going to name
147:00 - it as a dot ppk we'll hit save
147:04 - and so now we just need to grab the
147:07 - public key
147:09 - which is apparently this here
147:11 - so we'll go ahead and copy that out
147:14 - it's a bit easier on a mac because you
147:15 - just run the um a single command which
147:17 - is i'm sure it shows in here for linux
147:20 - and mac
147:21 - and so we'll go back over here
147:24 - yeah see that's what it is for mac you
147:26 - just run that line
147:27 - we'll go back over here
147:29 - and
147:30 - we can choose or paste we're gonna
147:33 - i think we just paste it in here
147:36 - we'll go ahead and hit create
147:40 - and hopefully that will work and there
147:41 - we go so it's creating our instance and
147:42 - it's starting up
147:46 - so now we just have to wait for it to
147:47 - provision i'm not sure how long it takes
147:49 - it shouldn't take too long
147:52 - but we'll just wait a little bit here
147:57 - so after waiting uh about five minutes
147:59 - our server is now running it's gone
148:00 - green
148:01 - and so i just wanted to show you a few
148:03 - things here so over here we have vnic so
148:06 - that's the virtual network interface
148:07 - card that is attached to this
148:10 - you can see that we want to get instant
148:12 - access you're connected a running
148:13 - instance using a
148:15 - shell we could connect so that's why we
148:17 - made our private and public key there
148:21 - we can see our shape configuration that
148:22 - we chose
148:24 - if we scroll down here and we go to boot
148:26 - volume you can see that it created us a
148:28 - boot volume and it's attached
148:30 - it looks like there's a console
148:32 - connection
148:33 - so this might be a convenient way to
148:35 - connect to the instance here you can set
148:37 - up work requests um so we can see that
148:40 - it created an instance so it shows us
148:42 - some history there
148:43 - um but yeah that's the instance there so
148:46 - yeah there we go
148:51 - so now that we're done with this
148:52 - instance let's go ahead and just
148:54 - terminate it so we'll go to actions and
148:55 - we'll hit terminate
148:57 - and we'll permanently delete the boot
148:59 - volume because we're done with that
149:03 - all right so there you go now if you
149:05 - wanted to make a database it's not going
149:07 - to be that much different you could do
149:09 - autonomous i think we get two for free
149:11 - so we just go ahead here i'm not going
149:13 - to go through the whole process i just
149:14 - want to quickly show you
149:16 - that
149:17 - the way you'd set up a database is you
149:18 - choose the database
149:21 - or the the transaction processing or the
149:23 - shared infrastructure
149:25 - you fill in your username password and
149:27 - etc you can bring your own license or
149:29 - license and create your database that
149:30 - way so i just wanted to quickly show you
149:32 - that but we'll make our way back to the
149:34 - compute instance and we can see that
149:36 - it's terminating it's going to take a
149:38 - little bit of time but if we see that we
149:40 - know that it's terminating we don't have
149:41 - to worry about it so
149:43 - i think we're all good for that so i
149:44 - just click back the home here and this
149:46 - section is done
149:49 - [Music]
149:53 - all right so i'm going to show you how
149:55 - to uh create your own bucket and start
149:57 - using object storage so we'll go all the
149:59 - way up here um to the hamburger menu and
150:01 - we're going to go to object storage and
150:02 - we're going to choose object storage
150:05 - what we're going to do is create
150:06 - ourselves a bucket
150:07 - and then we'll name the bucket whatever
150:08 - we want
150:10 - and we'll go ahead and we can enable
150:12 - object versioning we don't need to do
150:13 - that
150:14 - you'll notice that we can use the oracle
150:16 - manage keys to encrypt it but by default
150:18 - it is encrypted we can choose standard
150:20 - or archive archive is going to help us
150:22 - save more money if we choose that go
150:24 - ahead and create that bucket
150:26 - and so now we can click into that bucket
150:29 - and
150:30 - if we want to upload objects we just
150:31 - have to click upload
150:33 - so i'm just going to upload something
150:34 - from my desktop
150:36 - so let's go upload ourselves an object
150:38 - so we'll go to upload object
150:40 - i happen to have an image of the
150:42 - enterprise d that i want to upload so
150:44 - i'll just place it there
150:46 - i'm going to call that enterprise
150:49 - d
150:50 - we can see if there's a few other
150:52 - options here
150:54 - so we can just change the metadata and
150:55 - response header i'm just going to leave
150:57 - that all alone we'll hit upload
151:02 - and
151:04 - it uploaded was very fast okay
151:06 - and so there's our object and so on the
151:08 - left hand side we do have some other
151:09 - options such as metrics
151:11 - so we can see
151:12 - bucket size and number of objects
151:15 - we have pre-authenticated requests so if
151:17 - objects are private and we want to give
151:19 - people access to it i assume we could
151:20 - use that
151:22 - there are work requests
151:25 - work request is a feature of management
151:27 - os so i'm not sure how that fits in
151:29 - lifecycle policies you could create a
151:31 - rule probably to move it to archive so
151:33 - imagine that you had a like a lot of
151:35 - files and you needed to move them into
151:37 - archive so that you could hold onto them
151:39 - for seven years but you wanted to move
151:41 - an archive so that you're saving money
151:44 - that's what you use a life cycle policy
151:46 - for
151:47 - there's a replication policy
151:49 - replication would be for um backing up
151:52 - your data in another region so
151:54 - if this region for whatever reason uh
151:57 - suffered a disaster you would lose your
151:58 - data but if you replicated it into
152:00 - another region uh you wouldn't have that
152:03 - issue there
152:04 - then we have retention rules this sounds
152:05 - like that you can decide whether to
152:07 - delete files over time so by time bound
152:09 - or indefinite so it says
152:11 - object delete a modification is
152:13 - prevented from the retention during
152:14 - period so you can say you're not allowed
152:15 - to delete a file for this period of time
152:17 - so imagine that
152:18 - you are you have accounting files you
152:20 - have to hold on for seven years you
152:21 - could say hold on to these for seven
152:24 - years
152:24 - or you could say indefinite never never
152:27 - delete these files
152:29 - so hopefully that gives you an idea of
152:30 - object storage i'm going to go ahead
152:32 - here and delete this object
152:34 - but that's as simple as it is
152:37 - so there we go
152:39 - [Music]
152:44 - so now let's take a look at launching a
152:46 - database or at least look at the options
152:48 - because oracle is known for databases
152:49 - and they have quite a few options we
152:51 - have the autonomous data warehouse the
152:53 - autonomous transactional processing bare
152:55 - metal vm exudate exadata
152:58 - data safe which is for visualizing
153:00 - whether our data is safe nosql database
153:02 - and mysql where we have db systems and
153:05 - it can do backups we'll go to the
153:07 - autonomous data warehouse
153:10 - and it doesn't really matter what we
153:11 - choose because i think when we choose it
153:13 - it allows us to choose these two options
153:15 - and right now i'm under baker's account
153:17 - but let's say we want to do
153:18 - transactional processing so that's an
153:19 - oltp we want to be shared so that it's
153:22 - it's more cost effective
153:24 - and we want to use the free tier always
153:26 - free resources can be created in both
153:28 - free tier and paid so
153:29 - we'll check box that on if you're if
153:31 - you're always free tier has no activity
153:34 - seven days the database will
153:36 - automatically stop so they don't want us
153:38 - to really use it if we're not
153:40 - we can choose our database version
153:42 - apparently there's only one
153:44 - we have auto scaling we could turn that
153:46 - on so our database automatically scales
153:49 - um it's not let me checkbox it so i
153:51 - don't know there our admin credentials
153:53 - is going to be admin
153:55 - apparently we can't change that and
153:56 - we're just going to set this a password
153:58 - i'm going to do testing one two three
154:00 - um for one two three abc
154:04 - exclamation
154:06 - um testing
154:08 - one two three abc
154:12 - oh it's making this really hard for me
154:13 - uh uh contain at least one uppercase
154:16 - lowercase one number cannot use double
154:18 - quotations okay
154:20 - so i say testing
154:22 - abc all caps one two three
154:24 - testing
154:26 - abc
154:28 - one two three and we'll just look here
154:31 - configure access control rules um i
154:34 - don't know if we need to do any of that
154:35 - i guess we could restrict based on ip to
154:36 - say only this person from this ip so
154:38 - like my only my home address is allowed
154:40 - to access the server
154:41 - and we're gonna use license included i'm
154:43 - gonna look at some advanced options we
154:44 - just have some tags we'll go ahead and
154:46 - hit create autonomous database
154:48 - and so it's going to start provisioning
154:50 - that instance and so we're just gonna
154:52 - wait and i'll see you back here in a
154:53 - moment
154:56 - so after a short wait our autonomous
154:58 - database
155:00 - is all ready and running and we have
155:02 - some options here we can scale up and
155:03 - scale down which is kind of cool
155:06 - we can restart it we could create a
155:07 - clone we could add access control list
155:09 - we could reset the password
155:11 - and we can do a db connection so let's
155:13 - go ahead and click that
155:14 - so here it says to download the client
155:17 - credentials download the wallet so we
155:19 - can go ahead there and download that i'm
155:20 - not going to go do that
155:23 - we have metrics down below
155:25 - if we have backups we could see them
155:27 - here we can make a manual backup
155:29 - whenever we just click that put the name
155:31 - in and it would create a backup creating
155:33 - backups can be a little bit slow so i
155:35 - don't want to do it and i think right
155:36 - now we'd have to upgrade to use this
155:38 - feature so we're not going to be able to
155:39 - do any backups let's go to the tools and
155:41 - so in tools we have sql developer web
155:44 - oracle ml user administrator oracle
155:47 - application express and soda drivers
155:51 - i think this might give us an interface
155:52 - i'm just going to go ahead here and
155:53 - click that and see what we get
155:56 - and we'll just wait here a little bit
155:58 - and so here we are in the sql developer
156:01 - i wonder if it's the same if i go admin
156:04 - testing abc123
156:14 - and there we are and we're actually in
156:15 - our database so that's really nice
156:16 - because it allows us to directly work
156:19 - with our database
156:20 - has a data modeler that sounds really
156:22 - cool
156:26 - um so i'm just clicking around here
156:36 - so i'm not exactly sure how this works
156:38 - but it's kind of cool that we have this
156:40 - interface here that's built in i haven't
156:42 - seen this with any other provider i
156:44 - assume we just start writing sql
156:47 - so
156:48 - you say select all
156:51 - or
156:52 - show tables
156:54 - i can't say i really know my oracle i
156:57 - know my mysql pretty well
156:59 - but we launched an oracle autonomous
157:01 - instance
157:03 - okay so i didn't see any output there
157:06 - but it's nice to see that we have that
157:07 - as an option
157:09 - um but yeah that is launching a database
157:11 - so let's go ahead and we'll just shut
157:13 - down this database because we're done
157:14 - with it we'll just say terminate type in
157:16 - the database name to confirm termination
157:18 - are you sure you want to name it here
157:20 - they put it there so you can just copy
157:21 - paste it like that
157:23 - that is a very nice name for a database
157:25 - and that's terminating so that's all we
157:26 - have to do and so that's databases
157:30 - [Music]
157:35 - so if you're ever wondering uh like how
157:38 - you can determine uh who is doing what
157:39 - within your account uh there's a service
157:41 - uh for oracle called audit so what i
157:44 - want you to do is go to your hamburger
157:45 - menu we're going to go down to security
157:47 - or sorry
157:48 - [Music]
157:50 - i can't remember what it's under here
157:52 - governance and we're going to go to
157:54 - audit and so what audit allows us to do
157:56 - it allows us to see what's been going on
157:58 - within our account so if we wanted to
157:59 - find out who did what
158:02 - that's how we could do it you could drop
158:03 - it down based on their action types
158:05 - filter but based on keywords but we can
158:07 - just scroll down here
158:08 - and eventually you'll see my names you
158:10 - can see that i was in the database
158:11 - service so i was looking at the database
158:13 - service deciding whether i wanted to
158:14 - start a server
158:16 - and then if we keep on going down we
158:17 - probably would see that i was trying to
158:19 - launch a
158:20 - server
158:22 - but yeah if you're just trying to figure
158:23 - out who did what in the system that is
158:25 - what
158:26 - audit does okay
158:28 - that's just good to know
158:31 - [Music]
158:36 - all right i just want to show you
158:37 - another thing with billing that is
158:38 - something you should probably do so if
158:40 - you go to the hamburger menu here and
158:42 - we're going to go to account management
158:43 - and we go to budgets we can set a budget
158:46 - and a budget's really good because it's
158:47 - going to help us make sure that we are
158:49 - keeping track of our costs so i've
158:51 - already created a budget here called the
158:52 - overall budget and it can show us that
158:54 - we had spent a hundred dollars
158:56 - and our spend so far is four dollars and
158:58 - fifty four cents and that's how much of
158:59 - our spend period that has occurred so
159:01 - far and that's how much it forecasts
159:03 - it's going to happen
159:04 - um in the future let's go ahead and
159:06 - create ourselves a new budget
159:08 - we can say another budget
159:12 - and you can do it based on compartment
159:13 - or a tag
159:15 - it's probably going to ask us for a
159:16 - description so you choose your component
159:18 - you say a hundred dollars
159:21 - you can choose the threshold so actual
159:23 - span versus forecast you could choose
159:24 - the threshold being 50 percent this is
159:26 - going to determine when it actually
159:28 - emails you to say hey your budget is
159:29 - approaching and then you put your email
159:31 - in here and that way you'd get an email
159:33 - about it
159:35 - so i'll go ahead and create ourselves a
159:36 - budget um a budget already exists for
159:39 - this component so i guess you can only
159:40 - make one uh per
159:43 - compartment
159:45 - all right and so i just made another one
159:47 - there
159:48 - but i don't really need another one so
159:49 - i'm going to go ahead and delete that
159:52 - but yeah you should definitely set up a
159:53 - budget because you want to keep on top
159:54 - of your cost so that you don't get over
159:56 - billed
159:57 - and so there you go
159:59 - [Music]
160:04 - okay so now what i want to do to show
160:05 - you a little bit about building um so i
160:07 - actually switched over to baker's
160:08 - account because um he actually has some
160:10 - spend out of his free tier you can see
160:12 - over here on the right hand side it says
160:14 - he spent four dollars so far and he has
160:15 - four days for his um
160:18 - his trial to end but what we'll do is
160:20 - we'll go to the hamburger menu up here
160:22 - we're going to scroll all the way down
160:23 - and we're going to go to account
160:25 - management and we're going to go to cost
160:27 - analysis
160:28 - and this will show us
160:30 - our free trial again so it's the same
160:32 - information there it tells us to upgrade
160:34 - but it's also going to give us a
160:35 - breakdown of compute block storage
160:37 - networking etc so here we can see those
160:39 - costs in detail
160:41 - so i just really wanted to show you that
160:42 - so you know where you can analyze your
160:44 - costs
160:47 - [Music]
160:52 - so now we're going to look at booking
160:53 - our exam and so the test center
160:56 - network that is associated with oracle
160:58 - is called pearson view and they do both
161:00 - in data center and also proctored exams
161:03 - proctored meaning from the comfort of
161:04 - your own home
161:05 - and
161:06 - that's all up to you
161:08 - but if we want to go start taking an
161:09 - exam what we can do is go to test takers
161:11 - and click on schedule an exam then we
161:14 - can search uh the type of certification
161:17 - we want so i'll type in oracle
161:19 - and we'll click here
161:21 - and then from there what we'll have to
161:22 - do is go and create ourselves an account
161:25 - or sign in i don't have an account so
161:27 - we'll go ahead and hit create account
161:29 - we're going to have to click i agree
161:32 - um indicate that you've read the terms
161:33 - we'll scroll all the way down the bottom
161:35 - check box that i agree
161:38 - so what we'll have to do is fill in our
161:40 - personal information so i'm just going
161:41 - to scroll through this so you can see so
161:43 - you have to put your title your first
161:45 - name middle name last name suffix
161:47 - and then your email so i'm going to go
161:48 - ahead and do that
161:50 - do you know of an oracle testing id no i
161:52 - do not
161:53 - know my oracle testing id so i am mr
161:57 - andrew
161:58 - william
161:59 - [Music]
162:00 - charles
162:01 - brown
162:03 - i don't have a suffix
162:05 - we'll go ahead here and i'll just say
162:06 - andrew at exam pro dot co andrew at exam
162:10 - pro
162:12 - dot co
162:14 - uh and sure i'll receive some marketing
162:16 - messages
162:17 - that looks good to me there's four steps
162:19 - personal information contact information
162:20 - additional information and create an
162:22 - account
162:23 - so hit next for create an account or the
162:26 - next step
162:30 - and what we need to do is we need to
162:31 - fill in our personal contact information
162:34 - so i'm going to say i'm from home
162:36 - and i'm in canada
162:42 - and i'm just going to fill in the rest
162:44 - of my information here
162:46 - great and now that i've filled in my
162:48 - personal uh address here i'm just going
162:49 - to scroll down and i just need to fill
162:51 - in my phone number
162:54 - and choose my corresponding language
162:58 - and we can go to next
163:04 - and now it's going to ask me if i'm part
163:05 - of the oracle partner network i am not
163:08 - if i was i would get a discount
163:15 - now it's going to ask me to make a
163:16 - username i'm going to go ahead and try
163:18 - to make one
163:27 - great
163:28 - and now i need to make a password
163:31 - so i'm just going to go make a password
163:39 - and then it's going to just ask me a
163:40 - security question
163:42 - great and we'll go next
163:49 - and now what we can do is we can view
163:51 - the exams that we want to book
164:02 - and so here we have a list of exams so
164:04 - we're looking for the foundation's exam
164:06 - so we could just type in foundations up
164:08 - here
164:12 - and then we have the the course codes
164:14 - here so we want to make sure that it's
164:16 - the correct one you can see that there's
164:18 - 20 and 20 f
164:20 - so i'm just going to double check what
164:21 - the code is
164:25 - so our code doesn't have the f i don't
164:27 - know why there's one with f maybe it's
164:29 - like for french i didn't mean to click
164:31 - it it's just loading now
164:45 - so what we'll do is we'll click the one
164:46 - that doesn't have the f
164:52 - then it's going to ask us where do we
164:53 - want to take the test we can say
164:55 - in our home office
164:58 - and then we can run a pre-check you
164:59 - definitely want to do a pre-check if you
165:01 - can
165:04 - so what this is going to do
165:06 - it's just going to check our systems
165:09 - we're going to see if we can pass
165:11 - right now my webcam isn't working it's
165:13 - showing something here
165:14 - and so this is just to check is my audio
165:16 - working do i have good internet and does
165:17 - my webcam work i'm just going to go hit
165:19 - next
165:20 - and so i've passed the checks so i can
165:22 - close this
165:23 - and then go next
165:29 - and the next thing we can do is we can
165:31 - agree to the online policy so we have to
165:32 - go and click through all of them here
165:35 - hit next
165:38 - and then it's going to show us the price
165:40 - of the exam and also what exam we're
165:42 - taking
165:43 - and the operating systems and other
165:44 - settings that matter we'll hit next
165:49 - and then here we have this option
165:51 - consecutive appointments you may add one
165:53 - or more exams to take on the same day
165:56 - and so i'm just going to hit next
166:00 - and so now we would choose a time so i
166:01 - could say
166:03 - you know on the
166:05 - on the monday
166:07 - here so we could say let's do it on
166:09 - monday
166:12 - and then we would need to choose the
166:13 - time the only time available is 9 pm
166:16 - so i could also choose maybe wednesday
166:17 - where i have more available times so
166:20 - here we could say 2 15.
166:28 - and then from here we're going to see
166:30 - our options it's going to show some of
166:32 - my personal information here and then
166:33 - all we have to do from here is proceed
166:35 - to checkout
166:38 - we're going to be presented with the
166:40 - policies
166:45 - prison with policies and then from here
166:47 - you just go hit accept and you would pay
166:49 - with your credit card and that's all
166:50 - there is to it so
166:52 - the reason i don't want to go through
166:53 - the whole whole end here is because i
166:55 - actually i'm not looking to book the
166:56 - exam today but this is the whole process
166:58 - to book with pearson vue
167:01 - and so good luck on your exam

Cleaned transcript:

hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and welcome to another cloud certification and this time it's oracle foundation's associate certification it is the entrylevel certification for the oracle cloud infrastructure platform uh and i'm going to show you in less than a week how to pass this certification and if you are new to cloud it's a really great one to do and i have some really great follow alongs for you that's going to show you how to set up your account how to launch an instance and database and just generally understand uh the reasons why you'd want to use cloud so uh you know i hope you enjoy this course please do the follow alongs it's gonna really help you pass uh and i'd love to hear uh your feedback and if you do pass definitely share that with me because i love to hear that you're passing these courses and i'll see you soon so i want to do a quick comparison between the oci foundations and the aws certified cloud practitioner certification both these uh certifications are foundational so they are the first certification you would take if you're starting out on cloud um but let's get into it and the first thing is that the oca foundation certification is only valid for 1.5 years and that is a very short period of time the aws certifications are generally two years but as of recent the ccp is now valid for three years and so why oracle did this i do not know but i i guess that the reason they might have done this is that because their platform is so new they're anticipating that their platform is going to rapidly change in the next couple of years and they don't want to have a bunch of certification holders who claim to know how to use their platform when the platform is so different so maybe uh the next time in the next two years we'll see um they'll have new versions of their certifications and they'll be valid for a longer period of time but right now it's a very short period of time and i do not like that one thing i want to point out is that the oci foundation certification is five dollars cheaper than the ccp that is a very minute difference but it might matter to you if you're on a budget if you are going for multiple certifications beyond the foundational cert um one thing i really like that aws does is they give you half off the next certification so if you sat the ccp which is a hundred dollars and you go for an associate which is generally 150 it's now just 75 dollars so you're spending 175 dollars for two certifications oracle does not have such a deal right now um if if you're listening oracle i strongly recommend that you uh adopt this because it's very very cool um but right now they do not have it so you're going to get a better deal on the side with aws if you've ever taken the az 900 or the aws ccp and you're wondering whether you should go take the oracle foundations i'm going to tell you that the knowledge transfer is extremely good if you were to pull up all three of these certifications on the screen right now uh like the exam guides you notice that their their outlines are extremely similar so the only difference is that the names of the services are different and there's some differences in billing so if you already have that ccp and you want to add another certification to your roster certifications and you have the money i do strongly go recommend and get the oracle foundations one thing i don't like about their exam is that it doesn't have weighted domains and i'll we'll talk about this in an upcoming slide but the problem with that is that if they're not weighted that means that the exam isn't going to be as balanced as it could be and so it'll be harder not because it's technically difficult but because the the balancing is off so hopefully they will solve this in the future this is a pro or con depending on the way you look at it but they are a very young cloud provider so they don't have as much stuff as aws but that's also advantage if you're new to cloud so if you find aws extremely overwhelming and you want to have a work on a simpler platform you can dig into oracle and grow with the platform as they add more additional services and the last thing or not the last thing but i want to point out that their documentation is very fragmented this was very hard for me to put this course together because there was conflicting information or just i had to fill in the blanks for you here uh and i think i did take the best guests here but that is one thing that i wish they would improve upon and the last thing and this is the most important thing is that there is a lack of oracle certification holders and oracle is a very old company they've been around since the 70s and there's a lot of companies using oracle so if you do get oracle certifications i definitely believe there are jobs out there where having these certs are going to matter i do consider it a smaller market than the adabus certifications but if you are looking to stand out then this is a great certification to get so there you go so let's take a look here at the exam guide and this is the outline of what's actually going to be required of us to pass the exam and then after we go through the highlights here we'll actually open up the actual exam guide and i'll show you uh where you can find that information so the first thing is the domains and so the domains are cloud concepts osa infrastructure osec core services security billing and pricing but one thing you're going to notice is that there are there is no domain waiting on this exam so these domains uh we don't know if the exam is comprised of 40 of the questions of security 10 percent if these are all evenly distributed we just don't have that information and so that is one of the downsides of oracle certifications i think maybe in the future they might tell us but at this time i could not figure out how the uh how the questions are distributed but that's just what it is to pass this exam you're going to have to get a 68 i don't know if oracle i do know things about oracle but i don't know if they uh they do it at based on like a point system so on a bus it's like a thousand out of whatever um so you know you'd have to get 680 points to score out of a thousand but anyway we know the passing grade is 68 there are 60 questions on the exam uh and so you can afford to get 19 questions wrong all the questions are multiple choice there's no uh no questions where you have to multiselect any boxes so that's a little bit nice all right well it turns out i was actually wrong it does have multiple choice and multiple answers i just wanted to quickly correct that there and we'll go back to the video so yeah you're going to get a combination of both and you could see multiple answers where they might be asking you between two and three choices to choose from and then multiple choice would be just one out of the four um but there you go uh you have 105 minutes to take this exam so that means you're going to roughly have two minutes per questions uh it's going to be less than two minutes but you're going to have a lot of time to uh pass this exam and i strongly recom you're going to definitely have time left over and i strongly recommend that you go back and review all your questions and make sure that you made the the correct choices because sometimes when you're studying you're just in a hurry to get to the end so you don't run out on the clock and you should really go and take a second look at your questions and the last thing is that this exam is only valid for 18 months so once you get the certification you do have to get recertified in 1.5 years and i did say earlier that i i found that a strong disadvantage for oracle certifications and maybe that will change in the future but that's just how it is right now um but there you go and we'll go jump into the actual doc the actual pdfs now so here i have the exam guide opened in front of us here so we can get a bit better details of what the domains are one thing i couldn't easily find was how long the certification was valid for the way i found it was there was another marketing page and from this page there was this link and in this link it told us it was valid for 18 months and that's how i found out you have to get your certificate recertified in 1.5 years why it's not in this documentation i have no idea or i might have just not noticed it but i just wanted to point that out if you're trying to validate what i'm saying about the um how long the certification is valid for so let's hop over to the certification details here and just give it a quick zoom in here and you're going to notice that the exam number or for this exam is 170 1085 hyphen 20. i do not know why they named it that because it's very complicated maybe they have a lot of other exams we're not aware of but that is the name of your exam number it's very important to know your exam number because if there are future exams you need to know which one you are taking because the content might be different here they say the target audience is designed for technical and nontechnical professionals involved in selling and purchasing oci infrastructure which i definitely agree with um to take this exam you can take it via pearson vue so that is the partnered um data set or test center network so there's a few different tests test center networks and pearson view is a very wellknown one for their proctored exams proctored meaning that you can take the exams online so you can take this in a test center and that is the preferred way that's the way i suggest you to take your exams or you can take it online where they connect via webcam and they make sure that you uh you aren't cheating and then you just take it from the comfort of your own home we can see that's 105 minutes we have 95 for the exam cost and it looks like it says 25 percent discount on the list price if you are an opn so part of the oracle partner network you are likely not part of the oracle partner network if it's anything like the amazon partner network uh you have to do a lot of work to join that but if you are working for company and they have this then you can save a bit of money and the passing score here is 68 again it doesn't tell us the points it doesn't say 680 points it doesn't tell us the breakdown of the uh the scoring but we'll take a look here and maybe i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure it does not then we have some stuff about certification benefits nothing super exciting here but this is what the badge looks like so once you pass the exam you can download this digital badge and you're going to want to you could put this on your website but the huge advantage is you wanted to have that certificate and put in your linkedin so everyone can see it that's the the main goal of getting certifications is putting them on your linkedin and so we'll just scroll down a little bit and now we'll get to the actual um exam topics or i like to call them domains because most other providers call them domain so the first one is cloud concepts so and understand terms like scalable elastic agility fault tolerance capex opex understand the difference between iass pass and sas understand public private hybrid models reduce tco with migrations onprem cloud without rearchitecting then you have the getting started with oracle infrastructure so describe the key features components of oci so multiad 1ad 80 fault domains console apis clis and sdks i don't think we cover these two things but there's not much to talk about so i don't know why they have it there because i did not see it on the exam oracle cloud infrastructure services so understand the core services i am compute network storage databases understand cloud native services okay ocr ffn streaming api gateway um so that's kind of interesting then you have security compliance so oci security services so vcn sl nsg waff etc etc pricing support and operations so oca pricing model understand oci subscription models pricing calculator free tier the oci sla oci operations oci concepts like budgets quota limits and support so that is the breakdown of information that we need to learn and that we're going to cover that all in the exam what's surprising is that they don't have any white paper so with aws they usually have technical white papers they want you to read oracle actually does have white papers but it doesn't appear to be part of their exam just yet so maybe they'll do that in the future there's some information about like exam score if we pop over here doesn't really tell us much about how the scoring works it's just saying that you'll get the score with pearson vue after the fact and there's just some other information so hopefully that helps you better understand the breakdown exam and now we can jump into uh the actual content itself and start learning oracle so uh with onprem or onpremise uh you own the servers you hire the it people you pay the rent or real estate and you take all the risk but with using uh the cloud someone else owns the servers someone else hires the i.t people someone else pays pays or rents the real estate and all you're left to do is uh with the responsibility of configuring your cloud services and code and everything else is taken care by the cloud provider so it sounds pretty good to start with so to really understand cloud computing let's look at the evolution of servers to see how we got to cloud so if we go back to the 90s if you wanted a server you'd have to get a dedicated server and what that means is you'd have to go out buy a physical machine or all the components for it assemble that machine hire the it staff install the operating system and it was really designed only to run a single web app or website and so this was very expensive it was very high maintenance so if you wanted to run a web app you had to have a lot of money so it wasn't accessible to everybody and then as time progressed we figured out how to virtualize servers that means we were able to um place a virtual uh machine within a machine so you'd still buy a physical server but we had this other layer where we could actually run four websites or web apps on a single machine as opposed to buying four machines so the machine was better utilized uh and so that was a a a great advantage in um server technology then came along shared hosting so maybe the early 2000s the idea is that you had this one physical machine but instead of you having to buy that machine yourself which was really expensive you could share the cost with hundreds of other businesses and the way you're isolated uh from other um businesses is that uh you would wouldn't be necessarily in your own virtual machine but you'd have your own account on that machine uh and so you're really relying on other tenants so clients under utilizing the resources the only disadvantage of shared hosting is that if you have a particular client who overuses the machine everybody suffers because um that person is overusing the the the resources but generally most of the time it's very cheap but there are some serious limitations and then along came cloud and so what cloud did was instead of using a single machine you're able to use multiple physical machines that act as one system so the system abstracted uh the systems inspected away and we just called them cloud services and so the advantage here is that you get that virtual isolization uh which you have with virtual machines uh but you also get to save a lot of money because you're sharing the cost with a lot of other people um and and you get all these other advantages so with cloud hosting it's flexible scalable secure cost effective and high highly configurable if this isn't clear right now it will be uh later uh later on because i'm definitely going to really uh make the differences very clear here and all these models are still used so people still use dedicated servers virtual private servers shared hosting and cloud hosting it's just based on your use case but there's a lot we can do with cloud so let's take a quick look at what oracle is you may have seen their logo before if you've worked in enterprise or you've been working in tech for a very long time because they are a very wellknown company they are an american multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in redwood shores california they are the second largest software company by revenue and market capitalization that is a quote from wikipedia so i believe that it may be true and they have been around since the late 1970s and that explains why they're in redwood shores california because a lot of tech companies established themselves there i think microsoft did as well and they're uh best known for their databases so it's always a surprise when people say oh they're cloud provider i thought they only did databases they do other things and one database you might know is the mysql database so oracle has their own database called oracle but they also have mysql i don't believe they originally made it i think they bought it and it's an open source database but um those are two very popular databases so then the question is is what is oracle cloud infrastructure and that is what oracle calls their cloud service provider so with aws um that is so you have amazon and so amazon's is called amazon web service for google it's called google cloud uh provider and so oracle calls there's oracle cloud infrastructure so that's just what it is and so we can generally refer to it as oracle cloud infrastructure so oci or oracle cloud so when i say either of these or all three of these these are all the same thing just so you don't get confused and that is what we're focused on for the certification learning the oracle cloud infrastructure let's talk about the advantages of cloud computing and the first thing is on demand so you only pay for the resources that you consume there's no upfront cost with cloud computing you generally pay by the hour or by uh the minute or second depending on the service so you don't have to buy a server out right or or necessarily commit to uh like a like a one year three year or five year contract so there's a lot more flexibility there if you want to start doing business anywhere in the world you can because with cloud computing you can launch your workloads anywhere if you want to launch servers in tokyo frankfurt or canada you can just do that there is no extra work in order to start doing that the cost is a lot cheaper because you're sharing the cost with thousands of other customers all those computers have been uh treated like a single computer so the idea is that you are really saving a lot of money because there's so many people on the platform but you're still secure because you're all virtually isolated from each other you no longer have to do a lot of upfront work to launch a server or set up infrastructure so if this was on prem you would have to decide okay we're going to have this kind of networking and these kind of servers and we're going to hire these kind of people and so you have to really plan for your project in the old way but with cloud you can just start launching resources experiment and as you experiment you have detailed monitoring on a lot of those services and so that's going to make it a lot easier for you to figure out exactly what you need and you don't really have to guess um if you uh are launching a physical server like if you're doing onprem you might and you're expecting you're going to have a lot of growth you might end up having to buy a bunch of servers that are not being utilized because you haven't met that capacity yet but the cloud it's elastic so you can add or remove servers uh when need be so you're only paying for the actual uh capacity that you need so that's really nice and the last thing is that it's really really fast to market so with a few clicks you're going to be able to set up a bunch of infrastructure where if you're doing this on your own it could take weeks or months if you had to do it in your own onpremise or data center so hopefully that points out what are the advantages of cloud computing so let's take a look at the types of cloud computing and starting at the top of our pyramid and i promise you this is not a pyramid scheme it is just a great way of doing this visualization at the top we have a software as a service also known as sas this is a product that is run and managed by a service provider you do not worry about how the service is maintained it just works and remains available examples of sasses would be salesforce gmail and office 365 and this is for customers so you probably used a sas product and you just don't know it is the most common type of cloud computing so you've been using cloud all along then the next level down is platform as a service which is paas or maybe people would say pass but i've never heard anyone say it like that and this focuses on the deployment and management of your apps so you don't worry about provisioning configuring or understanding the hardware os to launch your applica your web applications so this for aws this could be elastic bean stock there's also heroku which is a very popular provider among junior developers and then you have google google app engine and this is really suited for developers it just makes development a lot easier without you having to worry about setting up your servers and then at the bottom we have infrastructure as a service and so this is the basic building blocks for cloud it provides access to network features computers data storage space you do not worry about the i.t staff the data centers or hardware and this is really what we are interested in uh so examples could be microsoft azure aws and oracle cloud and this is really intended for admins or being able to do anything and everything that you want um so when we look at oracle cloud it is an iaas or ice i don't know how to say that but you it also has platform as a service and software as a service so when you look at that pyramid you have to understand that infrastructure service the bottom encompasses everything so you know hopefully that makes sense but yeah that's the types of cloud computing so let's talk about cloud deployment models here very quickly so the first is cloud native and this is where everything is built on the cloud so here's an example of an architectural diagram what it does is it takes an image you upload to the cloud and then what it does is it turns it into a thumbnail and it gives it back to you but the point i want to get across here is that when we're talking about using the cloud as a deployment model that means that we're 100 using the cloud then you have hybrid architectures also just known as hybrid that's where you use onprem and the cloud again onprem would mean like your own local data center and then cloud would be the cloud provider and so what you could have here is you could have on the lefthand side this is the cloud network and then you have the onpremise network and they're being joined together to do work together so just because um you're utilizing cloud doesn't mean you have to get rid of your your uh your local data center or your onpremise data center you can use both and it's very common with large enterprises because there are definitely reasons to keep onprem around for uh security regulations and or just because you've had a data center for so long it's just too hard to move everything over to cloud then you have crosscloud this is where you're using multiple cloud providers some people might call this multicloud or hybrid cloud and so this is an example where we have aws on the left gcp on the right and we have azure connecting them together for the actual exam most cloud providers do not like mentioning cross cloud because they really want you to focus on uh their cloud platform some are more friendly than others for oracle they they're very collaborative with azure or microsoft so you'll see a lot of stuff cross cloud with those two providers oracle and microsoft and then microsoft tries to connect to everything but yeah those are the three deployment models but for the exam it's probably going to be like cloud hybrid and onprem i just list that last one there for your own benefit so let's talk about cloud architectural terminologies which is very important about the cloud so the first term i want you know is called availability and this is the ability for a service and when i say service i mean web application um to remain available and if we had an application that was very very available we would call that high availability ha and that is a term you definitely need to know and don't worry we're just going through a quick list here and then we're going to actually look at them all in more granular detail but i'm just going to quickly go through all these terms this next one is scalability so this is the ability to grow rapidly or grow where you're unimpeded so that is scalability then you have elasticity elasticity this is the ability to shrink or grow to meet the current demand then you have fault tolerances the ability to prevent a failure then you have disaster recovery this is the ability to recover from a failure and we usually call this uh being highly durable so it's abbreviated to dr i'm sure these other ones have abbreviations but generally the only two that people know is ha and dr so this is the two ones i want to emphasize so let's take a look first at high availability and this is your ability for your service to remain available by ensuring there is no single point of failure and or ensure a certain level of performance now i put no single point of failure because some of these terminologies kind of overlap in terms of responsibilities and so single point failure is really for uh responsibly for another one but you know i do highlight it here uh just to make the example bit easier so an example of having high ability is imagine you have a server and uh if you only had a single server and for whatever reason if the um data center became unavailable like let's say there was a outage um or a network outage or some sort or natural disaster then your website would not be accessible anymore so in order to make it highly available what we need to do is we need to run our server in more than one data center and so that's what you're seeing in that graph where you see 81 82 83 we have three servers running in three data centers and then we are sending all the traffic to all of them and actually running your your um your uh your your service in more than one data center and in fact three in three different data centers is a very very common practice uh is is generally a minimum requirement for a lot of enterprise companies because if one data center was to go out um then you need to have another redundant data center that that has your service running but if two went out and that's very unlikely but it's totally possible that's why you need a third one so three is the magic number and you need to definitely remember that but what is the mechanism that allows us to um distribute traffic to all these three uh different data centers where we have servers in each one and that's called a load balancer and so every cloud provider has a load bouncer and i believe oracle's is called the oracle load bouncer and so a load bouncer allows you to evenly distribute traffic to multiple servers in one or more more multiple data centers if a data center or a server becomes unavailable and so we could say that that means that it's unhealthy the load bouncer would route traffic to only healthy data centers and servers so again the thing here this red thing that's the load bouncer that's the internet from the internet we have traffic coming in and then it's going to evenly distribute to all those servers so that is high availability so the next cloud architecture terminology we want to talk about is high scalability so this is your ability to increase your capacity based on the increasing demand of traffic memory and computing power so imagine you have a server and the server is not powerful enough to run your service so what would you do the first thing most people would do is they'd buy a bigger server and this is called vertical scaling or scaling up because you are uh you're using the same machine and you are making it bigger so that is what vertical scaling is another way to scale is called horizontal scaling and this is where you scale out so you're adding more servers of the same size so that's vertical scaling and horizontal scaling you need to know scaling up and scaling out but that is the general concept of high scalability so now let's take a look at high elasticity so this is your ability to automatically increase or decrease your capacity based on the current demand of traffic memory and computing power it sounds a lot like the last one but there's one key difference and that is that you can add or remove servers add or remove based on the current demand of traffic and so the only way we're going to be able to do this is with horizontal scaling but when we are adding more servers we call that scaling out and we're removing servers because the traffic is it has reduced in size that is called scaling in and so you generally won't hear the term vertical scaling with high elasticity because generally it's very hard for traditional architectures to um to to scale elastically it's very hard to resize a single server to make it larger or smaller it's a lot easier to add extra servers of the same size so you just generally will only see it associated with horizontal scaling now the question is is how would you automatically scale in or out and generally there all cloud providers have a service for that the one that is for oracle is called auto scaling configuration so in oci you can configure scaling rules for your instances with the oracle autoscaling configuration so you could say when my server is uh is being the cpu is being 75 utilized add another server and when it goes down then remove another server and so high elasticity is a really great way to save money but also to make sure that your web application remains available because it can meet the current demand of traffic so let's talk about um being fault tolerant so this is your ability for your service to ensure there is no single point of failure preventing the chance of failure you'll notice i had mentioned this in high availability the no single point of failure thing it really means fault tolerance but you'll see in the example it kind of seems very similar to our other example there where we have redundant systems to make sure that we don't have a problem so here's an example we have a database and so we have a master database and something's happened to our database and so we want to make sure that in the case of failure we can fail over to a redundant system so we call this a slave and it's on standby because it's not in active use but it will be once we move it over and a really good way to conceptualize this is if if you think of like a play like for theater you have the lead actor or actress and they always have an understudy a person that will take the the the main actor actresses place if they get sick and they will know everything they'll be up to date on everything and so that is what we have here where we have that says it's in sync because that standby slave has the exact same information as the master it's just not in use and so the and so when there is a failure we call it a failover that uh that's when uh you plan to shift the traffic to the redundant system in the case the primary system fails so that is fault tolerance so let's talk about high durability and this is the last one on our list so this is your ability to recover from a disaster and to prevent the loss of data so solutions that recover from a disaster is known as disaster recovery dr you're going to want to remember that abbreviation it's used a lot in the cloud and so imagine you have a database if you had a single database and something happened to it you would be out of business so you want to have backups you might also want to re run your database in multiple data centers across multiple regions and that's what we're doing here and then we want to have backups so that is generally like a very sim simplified way of thinking about disaster recovery but the questions you should be asking is do you have backups how fast can you restore that backup does your backup still work just because you have a backup doesn't mean it works and how can you ensure your current live data is not corrupt so just because you have a backup maybe there's actually a bug in the realtime database so maybe an analogy would be imagine that you have defective cells in your body your body wants to repair those cells so you don't get cancer so it's always replacing old dead cells and and this thing can actually also happen with databases where you have bad data and you don't want that bad data to spread so you can have self a selfhealing database so hopefully that makes clear what high durability is so let's talk about the total cost of ownership tco but you might also know this as capex and opex as a comparison of what the total cost of ownership is and to understand this uh this concept i have this nice visualization where i have two icebergs um where you have the ice cap and then what's underneath some people don't think this looks like uh icebergs um they think they look like teeth or something strange so what i've done is i've added uh some penguins and a whale so that you know that they are icebergs uh and this is the best i can draw so um you know don't give me too hard of a time but let's look at the comparison here so on the lefthand side there is capex and this would generally be your onprem and you'd be purchasing software license fees and then you have opex on the righthand side so this would be your cloud provider so in our case this is oci and what you are paying for is subscription fees so the idea here is that the total cost of ownership is is the idea is that if you want to own everything that you have to pay for everything and the idea is that by letting go of the ownership of things and you're going to have a lot of reduced costs and also reduce responsibilities and that's going to be better for you in the long run but let's look at onprem so if you're onprem you have to worry about implementation configuration training and then the the the large cost there is the physical security of your building the hardware that you uh need to buy and install and maintain uh you the it personnel so all the people to manage your onprem data center but when you move to the cloud you don't have to do any of that all you have to worry about is implementation configuration and training all that other stuff that infrastructure to run your servers and everything is abstracted away uh and so what you could see is about 75 percent saving so that's the aws example i'm sure it's the same for oracle but the idea is that uh previously you're paying a lot of money and now you're paying very little money and you can just focus on building your software um but what we really need to do for the oracle certification is really understand capex and opex because that's what they like to talk about so we're just going to cover this again and make sure you understand those two terms very clearly so let's talk about kpex versus opex and so kpec stands for capital expenditure and opera and opec stands for operational expenditure so for capital expenditure this is your onprem cost like if you own everything so you own or rent the building you own the vehicles maybe like company vehicles you own the hardware uh you own any type of equipment to do the job and maybe you even own the lands uh or you rent the land so there is a capital expenses there a lot of people still like to do onprem or data center because they care about capital expenses because they can get tax breaks and other things like that um i don't think that's a great practice because um you know it's better to uh not worry about these things um but some people that is a motivator in the enterprise world's like oh well if we we purchase it as a capital expense then we get to get a discount on it um for operational expenditures that would be like the products you purchase um the business itself or any systems so operational expenditures but the key takeaway i want you to have there is capital expenditure stands for capital that's where you buy things out rate and opex is operational expenditures and that's opex and this concept is the same thing as the tco where we're just looking at the difference between between who has ownership of what okay so i know we already covered the evolution of servers but i really wanted to uh make sure you understand the evolution of computing uh visually and the tradeoffs as to why because it's going to really help you uh understand the difference between uh a bear bare metal machine vms containers and functions so what we have here is a graphical representation of a bare metal or you might call it a dedicated machine uh so the idea here is that we have a physical server that is wholly utilized by a single customer you don't have you have to guess your capacity uh and you'll probably overpay for an under utilized server so if you have an application or multiple applications you're always gonna end up with a wasted space because you're always gonna have to buy a larger server because you're anticipating you're going to have to fill it but that space is going to be costing you money because it's not being utilized upgrading beyond your capacity would be slow and expensive because you'd have to buy an additional server or you'd have to replace the server you're limited by the operating system so you have one uh operating system installed it's going to be hard to patch and update especially if you have multiple applications and if you do have multiple applications running on a single server because you're trying to save money you might have conflicts in resource sharing so one might use more memory than the others because they're not virtually isolated or one could cause a vulnerability than the other one but the advantages of having a dedicated or bare metal machine is that you have a guarantee of security privacy and full utility of the underlying resources but with the caveat that you're actually able to configure it so that it is secure private and etc and so notice that i have an asterisk over the word dedicated so dedicated could just mean that you wholly utilize a single customer but the thing with bare metal is that there is no hypervisor layer so you could have a dedicated virtual machine or a dedicated bare metal machine but you'd never actually ever have a bare metal machine that is not dedicated i don't think there is a shared version of it so just note that there is no hypervisor at this layer it's like the original server where you have no no extra software layer for abstraction so now we're going to take a look at vms they're also known as virtual machines so you can run multiple virtual machines on one machine so look at our graphic there and you'll notice that it's not just one app it's multiple applications uh and so the way we're able to launch virtual machines is with the software layer layer called hypervisor that's all you need to remember that hypervisor is the one that makes virtual machines work and it's a physical server shared by multiple customers if it wasn't and you're the only one using it it would be called a dedicated machine so you can definitely have dedicated virtual machines it just depends on how you want to use that word dedicated you only pay for a fraction of the server because you're sharing that cost with everyone else you're still overpaying for underutilized virtual machines so the whole server you're not paying for the entire server anymore you're paying for the slice of server um that you've chosen to use you are limited by the guest operating system so the the the machine has an operating system and in the virtual machine you have the guest operating system but if you want to run multiple apps they're all limited by that uh that same one but multiple apps on a single virtual machine can result in conflicts and resource sharing so we still have the problem as we did before where one app could use more memory than the other and there's no way of setting limits on in each individual app so that is virtual machines and we'll move on to containers so now with containers uh what we have done is we are running a virtual machine that's running multiple containers and so container is just another isolation of your application but it also bundles in with it uh like os layer and package stuff so we're not bound by the actual operating system so the the software layer that controls the ability to run multiple containers if you're using docker it's called a docker daemon it's like hypervisor but that's for containers and your server can have hypervisor and docker daemons at the same time but the best part about this is that now we can maximize the utility of our server so instead of it being wasted space it we now have uh available capacity and it's a lot more cost effective because it's very easy for us to launch isolate isolate applications and we don't have to worry about them affecting each other and we don't have to worry about uh messing with the configuration of the os because it's all isolated so your containers share the same underlying os but the containers are more efficient than multiple vms and multiple apps can run side by side without being limited to the same os requirements and will not cause conflicts during resource sharing so you look at this you say how can we get any better than this and that's what functions will be next but you know hopefully the takeaway here is that we have less wasted space with containers or i should say now the space is more flexible or available for us to utilize so now we'll take a look here at functions and functions breaks down um our computing even further so uh what we do have is we have a managed vm and we also have managed containers so we're not responsible for the containers or the vms the cloud provider has ones for us and this is known as serverless compute because you don't have to worry about like setting up the containers or setting up the vms or anything all you need to do is upload your code and choose the amount of memory duration that you need and you're only responsible for the code and data and nothing else so it's extremely cost effective and you only pay for the time the code runs vms only run when there is code to be executed the only downside to functions or serverless compute is that they generally have a cold start so the these the vm that runs the actual or the containers that need to need to be launched and so there's that time it takes for it to launch um and that's only that's the only downside but there are ways around it but the point is is that uh with with serverless or uh or con or serverless compute it you can see that there's a lot less responsibility that you have to manage but there is lack of flexibility because you you're constrained with whatever those managed containers are have but anyway that's functions hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are starting on a new section here called the oci global infrastructure where we're going to look at all the bigger things that run the oci platform and the first thing we're going to look at is called regions so region is a geographically distinct location that has many data centers uh data centers uh in ocr called availability domains which we are going to talk about uh shortly here um and so i just want to emphasize that i say a region is a geographically distinct location uh the oracle documentation calls it a localized geographical area um i think we're picking hairs here but on the exam you might see it called a localized geographical area just realize that it's the same thing but the idea is it's just a part it's a place in the world okay and as of the year 2020 oci has 21 regions and they plan on having 15 more the three kinds of regions you can have are commercial so that's any customer can launch a resource in these regions government so only governments can launch resources in these regions and then we have azure connected so we have some commercial regions that are connected to microsoft azure which is another cloud provider um and it's similar it's similar in terms of services and stuff but they seem to work together pretty well uh if you're still not sure about what regions are i'll pull up the website here in a moment but i just want to show you a technical architectural diagram and this is the first architectural diagram of this course so what we have here is a a representation of oci so oci there is the actual platform and then we have a region because that's where you would launch your servers and a region can be any like a bunch of places in the world so it could be in toronto or it could be in tokyo so in this one we have one that is for tokyo and inside there we have an ad that's the the actual data center and in that data center we have our actual server okay so that is a region and now we'll just hop over to the website so you get a better visual idea what a region is so i found a world map here of all the regions for oracle and so the ones in red are the ones are commercial those are the regions you'll be able to launch your resources within then you have government regions those are the ones in blue as you can see they only have two currently here in north america these government regions exist because the government wants to launch resources onto the cloud but they need to meet certain requirements so these data centers are highly specialized for government regulations so unless you work for the government you're not going to be able to launch resources within those regions then you can see we have planned regions here so that's just oracle saying hey we're going to have more servers soon so please keep please make sure that you use oracle um there's also azure connected regions but they're not showing up here on this map so it's probably an ashburn in phoenix so it's just not clear it's very hard to find that graphic if you want a full list of regions you can go to the documentation here and here they all are they have this region identifier uh so that's what you're going to be used to looking at this is how you're going to identify the regions but they also have this thing called a region key here so we have sdk mel and etc and it shows how many availability domains those are the amount of data centers within that region which we'll talk about more later um if you want to see like actually how you switch regions when you log into the actual provider you'll be able to drop this down and just switch the region that you are in and then if we come over here just to this page here this shows us that not all services are available in every single region so if you want to make best use of all the oracle services they're always going to be available in u.s east or usc 1. i bet they always launch their new services there but just be aware that you might not have access to certain services and it just could be a matter of time for them to get the infrastructure they need to be able to run those services within your region uh and so i think that is everything we need to know about region so there you go so let's take a look at ads and ads is short for availability domain and this is what oci calls a data center and a data center is a secured building that contains hundreds of thousands of computers on the right hand side we have an example of an interior of a data center and of course you wouldn't want to have your dog there but i love that photo and all those wires on the right hand side are connected to a ton of servers and so a region will generally contain three data centers and that is a very magic number and we'll talk about that here in a moment but to talk about data centers within a region they are they need to be isolated from each other so in diff completely different buildings and the reason why is that if one data center fails you have other ones you can rely on but another important thing is that the servers need to or these data centers need to be just close enough so they provide low latency so those are the two things they need to be far enough away and isolate so there's no disaster but close enough that they're super super fast to talk to each other and this comes down to our last thing here which is um it's a common practice to run your work workloads in at least three availability domains to ensure services remain available in case one or two data centers fail now when i use that word workload that's the same thing as if i said service or web application so you'll see me interchange those words throughout this course workloads service and web application it generally means the same thing and so here is an architectural diagram of a region and in that region we have three data centers so ad1 8283 and this architectural diagram is not actually accurate because ca toronto one doesn't actually have um three data centers in that region so we said earlier that generally there's three data centers but toronto is not one of them but you'll see me use it as an example lot because that is where i'm from but anyway so this comes down to 1ad regions so oci regions not all ocr regions have 3 ads and it's a common strategy for cloud providers to initially launch a new region with only a single data center add more later and i mean this isn't great because if you want to work in enterprise you have to meet that minimum of having your workloads in three and three data centers in a region but the reason why oci does this is because they're trying to expand their business as quickly as possible and so it's important for them to open as many regions and they promise they'll say oh we'll open more later down the road so if we look at 1 80 regions and 380 regions you'll see that the majority of oracle regions only have one data center and there's only four regions that have three data centers germany london and uh the states so in this list we're actually only listing 16 and we said earlier there were 21 regions the reason why there's only 16 in this list is because we're only listing the commercial regions i'm not sure about the government regions but that's the reason this is a bit more short but there you go that's ads and that's it so let's take a look now at fds and fds is short for fault domains and fault domains is what oci calls a logical data center so what is a logical data center it's a virtual or abstract data center within a physical data center so the reason why we have these illogical data centers is that the physical data center which we call an availability domain contains resources such as infrastructure hardware and some of those resources are logically grouped together and made accessible to you within the oracle console and the reason why is that by having an abstraction on top of our physical data center this allows our cloud provider to put layers in between the uh in between such as logical security controls monitoring tools and fault tolerance and you'll notice fault tolerance is emphasized because that's the whole point of fault domains and the whole point of fault domains is that it's to isolate groupings of hardware within a data center so that they don't share a single point of failure so here is a diagram and again we're using ca toronto one which again only has a single region but for whatever reason i'm listing two but within that data center the the ad here right the uh the availability domain we have uh two fault domains and so the idea is like imagine there was a fire in the data center and so only half of the data center burnt down and if you happen to have your servers in the second fault domain then uh you know they would remain uh operational so this is just another way to reduce or to improve uh the fault tolerance of your systems and so that's the purpose of a fault domain hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are now looking at oci concepts and this is just a short section talking about some of the terminologies about that are in oci and so the first one we want to talk about is the console and so if you're going to hear me mention the word console multiple times and when i say that we're referring to the simple and intuitive webbased user interface that you can use to access and manage the oracle cloud infrastructure so see this this is the console anytime we are doing anything in oracle whether it's launching a server deleting a database or creating a new user we're using the console so just be aware of what that is so let's look at the concept of tenancy so when you first create your oci account oracle will create you a tenancy by default and this is where all your resources are going to go initially and what a tendency is it's a secure and isolated partition within oci where you create organize and administer your cloud resources a tendency is also known as a root compartment and a compartment is also another oci concept which we'll cover here shortly but you can see that we can have compartments within our compartments and our root compartment is also known as a tendency so now let's take a look at the osa uh concept of compartments so a compartment is a logical collection of related resources that can be accessed only by certain groups that have been given permission by an administrator and so a resource would be a cloud service so that could be an instance or vcns or block volume so the majority of cloud services in oci and so if you want to create compartments you just press create compartment and you can create a bunch there and so we can see we have three in this example one thing we want to note is that when you first create your account oracle creates you a tendency on sign up and this is known as a root compartment and that holds all of your cloud resources by default that's where they're gonna go uh you can only uh and some other additional things about compartments you can nest them and you can ask them six levels deep you can add and delete them whenever you like compartments are not region specific so you can group resources across region resources can be easily moved to other compartments you can compartment resources can interact with each other you can apply policies to compartments to determine user access and you can associate a compartment to a budget for cost analysis so you can see compartments um have a lot of functionality behind them but generally you know that's what they do so now we're going to take a look at oc ids so ocids is short for oracle cloud ids and this is a unique id assigned by oracle to your cloud resources and the reason they do this is so that you're able to easily identify these resources within your policies or maybe the api uh just to so that you can interact with them and so this is the format of an oc id so you have the uscid one the resource type the realm the region the future use and unique id it's not so important for us to go through all those all i want you to take away from this is that it's a unique identifier identifier for a resource here's an example of a tendency and you can see it's very long and complicated and then here is one for an instance so a server so that's oci ids so now i want to talk about how do we get pragmatic access to oci so the main way is through an api an application programming interface and this is a way to interact with cloud services pragmatically and this concept of api is not specific to oracle it's for all cloud providers or applications and so the api is how you would get access to it but there has to be some vehicle or mechanism to interact with the api so one way would be to use a command line interface also known as a cli and this is a shell terminal program that you could use you'd have to have linux and you'd have to have a terminal to access it but if you wanted to easily do it if you didn't have a linux machine oracle has a a web browserbased terminal called cloud shell and that's going to let you interact with the cli and it's going to already be preauthenticated so it's already going to have the access access tokens to allow you to start interacting with cloud services pragmatically another way would be to use a software development kit also known as an sdk and so this allows you to use common programming languages so that you can build applications that interact with oci and they currently support java go ruby and python and the way you'd actually get programmatic access is that you'd have to have um an api public key private key so you'd generate this on your own and you would upload it into oracle some other cloud providers you just press a button it generates it for you but with oracle you have to generate them yourselves and upload them yourselves so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are starting off a new section which is the core services for oci and starting uh with the first and most important one are the computing services so first on our list we have virtual machines so virtual machines is a multitenant server running a hypervisor layer so the idea here is you choose your os virtual image and you launch your server you share the cost with other customers so you save so anytime you launch a server this is generally the go to server that you're going to want to launch because it's the most cost effective and the most flexible if you don't understand what a hypervisor layer is right now do not worry we're going to talk about it shortly next we have container engines so this uh service for oci is basically docker as a service it allows you to run docker containers on a virtual machine so this is very popular for microservice or containerized architecture then we have the oci functions service so this is serverless compute you just upload your code and the cloud provi uh provider takes care of the rest so the code is designed to run for a short period of time and you choose a managed container with a run time so if you have ruby code you upload your ruby code i don't know if they support ruby but as an example you would upload your code it would run it and then it would stop but the idea is that um it's a lot more cost effective than a virtual machine and it's just also a lot less responsibility for you then we have dedicated virtual hosts so this is a single tenant server that is running a hypervisor layer where you can run multiple virtual machines you don't share the server with anyone else so you get greater security and performance are guaranteed but you can still run your own virtual machines and last on our list is bare metal so bare metal is a dedicated server that has no hyper visor layer so bare metal allows you to provide your applications with direct access to the processor and memory resources underlying server and this is suited for specialized workloads where the hypervisor would hinder performance so some people they just really want the original server you know like uh they there's nothing on it and they can configure it and they have that option so remember earlier when i when we talked about the evolution of servers and i said that everybody's still using everything well this is that perfect example of that but let's get more into the details as to you know why we want to use one type of setup over another so now what i want to do is help you decide which computing service you should choose based on the level of control or responsibility you want to have the more the more control you have over security configuration the more responsible you're going to have the more time it's going to take for you to maintain and spend money on those resources so if you can let oci do it i definitely recommend it for you and across the top we have bare metal dedicated virtual hosts vms vm is short for virtual machine you'll hear me use that abbreviation a lot in this course container engines and functions and so the first thing we want to look at is your code so you're always responsible for your code no matter what computing service that you choose so just be aware of that the nexus app container and when i'm saying container i'm using this in a very generalized term maybe we're talking about containers as being the vm or whatever but the point is is that all the way up to functions is the only time that oci is responsible for it so if you want to use containers or sorry if you do not want to manage your container use uh the functions the next layer is your runtime a runtime is uh it's like you're setting so your environment variables common libraries directory structure networking neighbors all those sorts of uh configurations on your os and so you have a less control when you're using the container engine service or the functions service next is your operating system and so for your operating system if you're using bare metal dedicated virtual hosts or vms you have more control over what os you choose then down below we have virtualization so virtualization is being taken care of for you by oci with the vms and the dedicated virtual host there is no virtualization on bare metal so if you do want to have it you're going to have to add that hyper visor layer yourself so there you go that is the um the idea with level control for computing services so next on our list is storage services starting with block volume so block volume i like to think of it as having a local virtual hard drive where you choose the hhd or ssd uh this is what you're going to be primarily using when you're using your virtual machines you're going to want to be using a block volume attached to it the next thing we have is a local nvme nvme is a transfer protocol for ssd that allows the drive to operate very very efficiently i had to look this one up but i'm sure people that make video gaming computers or that do video editing really do care about using mvme because it gives you extremely fast performance then you have file storage and so file storage is when you're using a file system such as nsf version 3. this allows multiple connections to the same storage device at the same time which is really nice when you're doing cloud stuff and you need something to have the same files then you have object storage so object storage is serverless storage and you can upload as many files as you like and it scales without worrying about running out of space or data loss because generally the data you put into object storage is highly available it will be replicated across multiple data centers then we have archive storage this is longterm cold storage and this is when you need to keep files around for a very long period of time that you might infrequently access and so the idea is you wouldn't want to put them in object storage because um you know the idea is that it'd be more expensive so if you if you never have to use them so let's say you have to hold on to records for the next seven years uh for like let's say for taxes you'd want to put them in archive storage so they're not uh costing you more money so i want to talk a bit more about storage services and just make it a bit more clear the difference between block versus file versus object because those are the main three that you need to be thinking about so let's first talk about block storage and so oracle service is called block volume and this is where the data is split into evenly split blocks and the data is directly accessed by the operating system and there's only support for a single right volume so if you have multiple virtual machines you're going to have multiple block volumes and you're not going to be able to share that volume with other machines or at least if you do it's not very easy and this has to just do with the fact that it's only the operating system accessing it the protocols that are being used here is fc maybe iscsi or iscsi and there's another one there you don't really need to know the transfer protocols but i'm just trying to point out that a block volume is directly accessed by the os and only supports a single right volume so you're not sharing that drive with multiple uh vms or users next is file storage and file storage is stored with data and metadata uh and so with this format you can have multiple connections via a network share so you can use protocols such as nfs or smb and so it's going to allow multiple users or multiple vms to access that file system and it's going to act as if you're all on the same computer which is really nice so it supports multiple reads but when you are writing to a file it will lock so if i'm writing on a file then you can't access it until i'm done with it last we have object storage so object storage is stored with data metadata and unique id the protocols we're going to be using here is http or hps and api the way you're going to access these files is through the internet so that's how you're going to get access to them the advantage of object storage is there is no there is no limit in terms of the size of the files or or the amount of files that you store or if there is they're very very high you're not going to be affected by them and the last thing is that it supports multiple reads and writes so there's no locks so you aren't going to be hindered if somebody is working with a file um so yeah those are your three solutions and another thing that i don't have in the slide here but um block volume is the most expensive at scale and object storage is the least expensive at scale so uh you know the the more you get to the serverless and that object storage is a serverless service uh the more cost effective it gets okay so now we're going to look at networking services networking is generally very complicated for any cloud provider for the foundation certification you don't need to know it in great detail you just have to have some practical knowledge of it so don't worry if you don't know all the little details here but let's go through it so for networking services we've already seen some of these earlier so the first thing is region so a region is a geographical location of your network and so there's my line i don't usually annotate very often but your region would be here okay so we have ca toronto one and so that is a geographical location the next is your availability domain and remember its availability domain is short for ad and this is a data center for your aws resources so here we have the aed and so this one is ad1 then you have your fault domains this is a logical grouping of your resources in a data center and so there is our fault domain then you have your vcn and vcn stands for virtual cloud network you're definitely going to want to know that one and i believe i have a complete slide for virtual cloud network just to really make sense of that and so it is here and that is your that is a logically isolated section of the oc cloud where you can launch your ocr resources then you have internet gateway so internet gateway is how you get access to the internet so there is the symbol for internet gateway you can see that it sits on the edge of um of oci and that's how it gets out to the internet then you have subnets subnets is a logical partition of of an ip network into multiple smaller network segments and we'll talk about that a little bit more in the next slide and this orange line around here is that subnet um but anyway the easiest way to think of a subnet is it's a slice of the vcn and then down below we have a virtual firewall options and so we have security rules and network security groups and security lists all i want you to take away from this is that these three things uh protect your uh your resources and so here this icon here is a one of those i can't remember which one it is i think it's a network security group i'd have to double check but the point is is that it represents uh a virtual fire firewall that is protecting uh your server and that's your server right there so you know that's one part of networking services and we'll hop on to the next slide all right so we're on to the second part of our networking services the first one was really if you're a cloud native or using it for your own personal account and these networking services are really for enterprise or hybrid hybrid architecture but we still need to learn them we don't need to remember them in granular detail but you should generally know what they do so the first is service gateway so here's service gateway and what service gateway does is it creates a secure tunnel that keeps traffic within the oci network so here is the symbol over here for service gateway and what you're seeing is that it's creating this secure tunnel to this uh service which is object storage and the reason why we want a secure tunnel is that generally there are certain services especially serverless services where they're not part of your vcn they're just they're just in the global oci account and if you want to access them they have to go out to the internet so this server would go out to the internet and go around and come back in and you do not want it to uh leave oci because as soon as you leave oci out to the internet it's no longer secure so by using service gateway we can keep the traffic within oci so it never leaves that's super important for people uh that are operating in the enterprise then you have nat gateway so that gateway is down here uh this is the there's actually no symbol for it so i made my own and what naked way does it allows private uh a private subnet so resources or servers and a private subnet reach out to the internet this uh orange dotted line is our subnet and so it doesn't have any access to the internet and so let's say we wanted to grab packages or software to update um the server and we have to get out the internet we use a nat to do that so that's done the next is ipsec vpn so a virtual private network is a way of creating a secure tunnel over the internet from your onpremise uh into oracle cloud uh and again anytime we leave out to the internet it's a dangerous territory so we want to secure that connection and that's what we're gonna use for that uh the next is fast connect it's just like um uh ipsec vpn but the difference is that it's a dedicated a dedicated secure connection to your onprem uh to oracle cloud what that means it's going to be really really really fast so not only is it going to be secure but it's going to be super fast and that could matter to an enterprise because they want the experience to be just as fast as their onprem data center then we have dynamic routing gateway so dynamic routing gateway is a virtual router that provides a path for private traffic between your vcn and outside network so to actually connect the fast connect or ip uh or vpn we need this drg which is that virtual private router if it's confusing to you it's confusing to me i don't ever set these things up but i know that it's a virtual router and i know that it creates a connection into the vcn and that's all you need to know too and the last one here is vcn peering so peering is the concept of connecting two vcns together and and treating them as the same network so if you have vcn1 here and vcn2 here then they can peer they can this server can talk to that server as if they're on the same network uh so those are all the concepts i wanted you to learn for networking services i know it's super complicated but just do your best because at the foundation level knowing networking stuff is not as important as the next level so now let's take a look at vcns and subnets so vcn is short for virtual cloud network it is a logically isolated section of oci where you can launch oci resources and so the way you define a vcn is you have to choose a range of ips using a cider range and it's not so important to know the math behind cider range all i want you to know is that it's a range of ips so if you chose 10.0.0.0 ford slash 16 that 16 is defining the size of the ip addresses and that would give you 65 000 ip addresses and what does that mean it's like if you want to launch 65 servers you'll you'll have enough ips to launch 50 or 65 000 servers and so there's the architectural diagram of of a of the oci network with a region and so there would be your vcn now the thing is with the vcn is we want to split it up into smaller logical sections and that's where subnets come into play so subnets is a logical partition of the ip network into multiple smaller network segments you're breaking up your ip range for your vcn into smaller networks and subnets have a cider range as well but the cider range has to be smaller than the vcn cider range because you're it's like cutting up a pie it has to be smaller you can't take the whole pie so for the example here i'm using cider range 10.0.0.0424 which would give us 256 ip addresses so it's a very small slice out of our of out of our vcn now subnets can either be public and so subnets that are public are ones that can reach the internet and you can see that's where our server would be launched into into the actual subnet or if we wanted a a subnet where it cannot reach the internet we'd call that a private subnet that doesn't mean that it it can never reach the internet it's just generally it's not supposed to because it's supposed to be secure but with nats and some other means that it can reach the internet let's talk about vcin so vcin stands for virtual network interface card and this enables an interface or sorry an instance to connect to a vcn and determines how the instance connects with endpoints inside and outside the vcn now remember an instance just means a server so if you want your server uh to be able to connect um to other services you need a you need a vcin so without a vcn your server would not be able to communicate with the internet or other networked cloud services in your vcn and the reason we're talking about this is because we're going to be looking at security lists and they're dependent on vcins here but on the exam i don't think they're going to really be asking you about vcins too much so let's take a look at our virtual firewall options so the networking surface offers two virtual firewall features that both use security rules to control traffic at the packet level and those two are security lists abbreviated as sl so this is the original firewall feature from from the networking service and security lists are associated with subnets and the security rules apply to vcions in those subnets and that's why we were talking about vcins because security uh both of these really relate to the those networking components but what i want to remember is security lists are associated with subnets then you have networking security groups this is the new virtual firewall i don't necessarily know if it will replace the old one because they both kind of have different use cases but the nsgs are designed for the application components that have different security postures so nsgs are suppor are supported only for specific services and nsgs are directly associated with vcins regardless of what subnet they are in so remember secure lists are associated with subnets nsgs are directly associated with the vcins so now it's time to take a look at the database services um and oracle is generally known for databases so they do have a few options it can be a little bit confusing because some services especially in the console some some services are not distinctly uh isolate from each other but we'll work our way through it and it'll make sense in the end so the first one is vmdb systems so vm standing for virtual machine db standing for database and so it's a virtual machine running a manage oracle database instance and it's going to be backed by block storage so um this could also be a mysql database which we'll talk about shortly when we go to the next slide but it's just a virtual machine and it runs oracle for you and the reason you might want to use this one is that it has very fast provisioning and or this is the most general purpose database that you'll probably want to use the next one is vm bm system so bm is short for bare metal and so it is not running a virtual machine there is no hypervisor layer so you get a much faster uh performance it uses a fast local storage so if if if you need a server that or a database that is really fast this is an option that you might want to consider the next is oracle rack and so this is um this is i believe the virtual machine it's just like vmdb systems but it is running in a cluster a cluster meaning that it's running more than one database so so you have two uh instances of databases and they're sharing the same disk but they're running on different nodes and so if a node fails the connection is going to fail over to another node so this is a great way to get higher durability which we talked about in or sorry fault tolerance this is better to have a better fault tolerance which we talked about with our cloud technology concepts then you have exit data db systems uh the first time i've ever heard of exadata but exadata is a preconfigured combination of hardware and software that provides an infrastructure for running oracle databases so oracle created their own special combination i imagine that the the advantage here is that you have extremely good performance for very specific use cases i don't know what those use cases are i don't think it's going to matter on the exam if you if you know but you just need to know that exit data exit data db systems is just specialized infrastructure that gives you great performance and last on our list is autonomous so autonomous can be autonomous shared or dedicated the difference between one being multitenant or single tenant and this is for automatically or sorry this database does basically everything you will automatically patch upgrade it will do selfhealing for bad data it's highly available by default it's secure by default and so it's a fully managed database it's going to cost you a lot more money than anything else on this list but it's going to it's going to do all the work for you so um you know it just it you never have to worry about this database so there you go so i just want to go over some of the uh database options because i do find it a bit confusing to know when you're creating what type of database in oracle because they have so many options so if you were to create a db systems or dbvm systems uh database option so that's kind of redundant how i wrote there but you could choose an oracle db system so that's the default and when you do you'd have to choose an availability domain any virtual machine and a shape type a shape type is just basically the vm like how much power do you want the machine to have like computing etc but you can also create a mysql database but what's strange is that when you make the oracle one you don't choose a fault domain but when you make one for mysql you can choose a fault domain is this going to be on the exam no but i just wanted to point out that you know i was a bit confused and this is what i observed as being the difference and then we have autonomous database options so when you go to create your autonomous database what you choose is between an oltp and an olap olap is going to be your data warehouse that's for reporting analytics and large and infrequent queries then you have oltp that's general purpose small and frequent and frequent queries um so oltp or transaction processing is what you're going to want for general workloads and then if you're working with big data you're going to want the data warehouse one then down below the next option you choose is between shared infrastructure so that's multitenant or dedicated that is single tenant then you can choose the license so bring your own license or you will use the license included so um again you know it's just like these aren't generally separated it's just like you go choose a database and you make these choices whereas in my my previous uh lecture there you saw that it looked like all the services were isolate so hopefully that clears that up when you're in the console if you feel a bit confused so let's quickly touch on oracle nosql and this is a service so you can have a nosql database so that it's a key value store um i'm sorry this slide is not more attractive but they just have no icons there's not a lot of information on it but generally we should know what a nosql database is and so the reason you'd want to use a nosql database over the other databases is that if you need to produce and consume data at a high volume and velocity null sql might be for you if you require instantaneous response time to match the user expectations no scale could be for you it's developed with continuous evolving data models and it can scale on demand based on dynamic workloads so there's just a point where uh relational databases um they they meet a point where it becomes very difficult to scale you have to do sharding and all these other things and so then it becomes a point where you want to move over to nosql so just think of nosql being for at scale and you know hopefully you don't get any questions on it but i just want to include it in there just in case so now i just want to cover some cloud native services um but really this section is just a bunch of oracle services that might show up on the exam and and so i need to get you a bit familiar with them so the first is oracle api gateway this is a comprehensive platform for managing delivering and securing web api so if you need to make a web api you're going to use api gateway then there's oracle streaming ingest and store continuous high volumes data streams and process them in real time if a question asks something to be in real time you so now let's talk about cloud native services but really what the section is about is just getting you exposure to more oracle services that might show up on the exam but you don't need to have deep knowledge about them so the first one is oracle api gateway and this is a comprehensive platform for managing delivery and securing web apis so if a question asks about creating an api it's probably uh it's probably telling you to choose api gateway then there's oracle streaming this is when you ingest and store continuous high volumes high volume data streams and process them in real time the question is asking about data streams or real time events then it's going to be oracle streaming oracle kubernetes container engine okay is a managed service to run kubernetes cluster if you see the word kubernetes it's talking about ok then there's oracle registry ocir and this is a repository repository for your docker containers if you need somewhere to store your docker containers it's going to be an ocir then there's oracle notifications it's a fully managed publish publish subscribe service for reliable and scalable message uh delivery so if the question has to do with something with notifications pub sub or message delivery that's what it's going to be the last one is oracle integrations a service to connect onpremise thirdparty to your oci with premade adapters for easy application integration so if you need to connect your onprem to your oci in a very convenient way so oracle integrations might be the answer so we're on to the billion pricing section so let's talk about pricing models so oracle has ways for you to save with the universal credit pricing also known as oracle uc i'm a little bit confused by the terminology because i don't know if it applies to both their pricing models but i'm going to make mention of it because we definitely need to know what oracle uc is or universal credit pricing is the at least know of the terms and so the first way you can pay is you can pay as you go so payg most other cloud providers call this ondemand so that's why i have it there and so the idea is that if you were to launch a server you're using payasyougo there's no upfront commitment you're build based on hourly consumption and you pay at the end of the month the other way you could pay is monthly flex and so these are plans to save money and i guess this is what uses the oracle uc so what you do is you make a commitment so you say i'm going to commit for a minimum of 12 months and i'm going to commit at least a minimum of a thousand dollars per month and that's going to give me savings between 30 to 65 percent um so it's just a way if you're a larger company and you know what you're going to be using you can definitely save a lot of money up front there's also another thing to factor in for pricing models and that is bring your own uh license so oracle has been around for a very long time and so people are running oracle uh products and software on their on their onpremise data center and they might want to bring those licenses over to save money so if you bring on over those licenses uh then you'll get the same support contracts that you've already agreed to if you don't have an existing license you'll just get one when you use the oracle cloud platform and the number one thing that i want to emphasize number one thing is that no matter what region you're in the pricing is the same so if you if you launch a server in tokyo it's going to cost the same in canada it's going to cost the same in germany now why does oracle do this they say it's because it's to keep pricing simple i'm not sure if i i believe that but i think it's just they're a smaller provider and maybe in the future they will start changing the prices per region because if i'm a consumer wouldn't i want the best price i can get for that region and some regions will be more cost effective than others but for whatever reason all regions are the same and that is critical to know if you come from other cloud providers this would be a surprise to you because all cloud providers have different pricing based on regions so there you go so i just wanted to quickly pull up the oracle website just to show you where you can find pricing so i just searched oracle pricing and this will show you pay as you go universal credits so i guess universal credits is really part of monthly flex i still don't personally understand why they're called universal credits it makes me think that you can reuse them any unused amounts can be rolled over to the next month okay so there you go that's probably why they call them universal credits and then you have bring your own licenses if we go over to this page here this is the universal credit pricing you're going to come down here and you're going to notice that there is no regions everything is very standardized so whatever you're paying for analytics it's the same no matter what region you're in but that is the payasyougo price and then that is the monthly flex price which is interesting because i would generally think that this price would vary based on your commitment whether it's one year or three years so i'm not really sure about that but what you need to know is that with monthly flex you save that's all that matters and then uh the last tab here this is just another one because this is a universal credit pricing but maybe you want to look at the actual compute pricing and so these are all the computing servers here so this i think this is their standard one so it's point zero three cents uh and point zero three cents if you're ever wondering how you would ever calculate your your yearly cost or your monthly cost you would just take this number here so i would take that i would just put it up in google i would do it times and i would say 730 hours and so the the base server would cost you 21. and 90 cents that's how i always calculate my monthly cost for servers it's just 730 times the number so there you go that is um uh the pricing so i want to show you one more thing here and that is the cost estimator so if you were to type in cloud pricing you're going to see this button here we're going to click into it and this is going to help you determine your cost so you saw me do the math where i took the hourly comp or the hourly compute and just times it by 7 30. but if you really need to compile out your own report what you can do is you can use their estimator here so we can go here and just look for any kind of service so we have infrastructure so let's add a vm so we'll go ahead and hit add and then it will say what kind of compute we can scroll down here and say we want to have one instance see where it says pay use pay as you go 63 dollars and there's just lots of things you can do here um so we would do that and i'm just gonna expand that so we have 63 dollars i could add an object store okay it says zero dollars um it's really based on our our storage so we'd have to go in here and start saying how much we'd use if we go to block volume uh this is um in gigabytes let's say we had 100 gigs now we can see it's four dollars so i just want you to be aware that there is a cost explorer and it will show you your pay as you go and flex it doesn't necessarily show you it has kind of an estimate but even here it doesn't give you a guarantee that it that is per month i've never hit the buy here but i would imagine that it just tells you to make a new account so there you go and you still have to set those up individually so just because you queued all those things up in the cost explorer doesn't mean that the the that they would create all those resources for you this is just a quick way of figuring out those costs and you can download it as a pdf so if you need to take it to your boss then we can just open this up here it'll just take me a moment and so there's that nice breakdown of all those costs all right so there you go um that is the cost explorer so let's talk about data transfer costs so for data transfer anything that is coming into um oci network is going to be free so data in is free we call that ingress any data that is leaving the oci network is going to cost us money we call that egress and so data transfer within the same availability domain is going to be free data transfer between available domains in the same region is going to be free data transfer between regions will result in a charge for data leaving the region but to really make this clear i'm going to give you an architectural diagram to to help visualize this so here's the oci network anything outside of the osa network we'll consider the internet imagine we have a server running in a data center in a region and so we have the internet and we want to bring data into that server so anything that's data in is going to be free anything leaving the oci network we're going to be charged for so now imagine we have another region and in this region we have an availability domain a data center and we have two servers maybe they're in different fault domains maybe they're different subnets but the point is they're in the same data center any data transfer between them is going to be free now imagine we have another data center availability domain in that region and we want to transfer data between those two that's going to be free because they're all in the same region now imagine imagine we want to get data from uh region the ch toronto one region to the um ap toronto one region so if you send data out it probably would have to go out to the internet and and it would and then it would come back in to that other region and so since it since even though we want to keep it in oci the fact that it's another region it has to leave the internet and come back in it's going to result in a charge now is there some way to bridge uh data from one region to another i'm not sure there is a service called service gateway but that seems to be for cloud services but if we could keep it all within oci i believe that it would be free but just remember if it has to go out to the internet it's going to cost money if it stays with an oci it's going to be free so i wanted to give block volume pricing a bit of emphasis because it's not as simple as one metric that it's built on there's actually two things you need to consider with block volume pricing the first is storage costs and the second is performance cost so for storage costs you're going to get build based on how what your store capacity is per month and so it's going to be the most because it's the same pricing in all regions it's going to be zero two five five uh cents per uh gigabyte i believe and then for performance cost it's going to be based on uh performance units per gpu per month and so they actually have a breakdown of three so for zero vpus it's zero dollars if you need to use 10 vp vpus it's going to be it's called balanced and it's point 17 cents if you need 20 vpus which they call higher performance it's zero 34 cents gigabyte per month if you're wondering what vpus are it's called volume performance units this thing is an oracle thing i'm not even sure exactly how it works i couldn't find any documentation on it but i just want you know that there are three categories and those are the prices and those are the options and those are the two factors you have to consider so in oracle you can actually tag your resources such as compute storage and databases and tagging allows you to filter resources so you can so it can be used in cost analysis to quickly determine costs or if you just want to find a group of resources but you're not necessarily applying permissions to them because compartments is for applying permissions so what you would do is let's say you had a compute resource you just say add a tag and then what you do is you'd fill in a tag key such as env and then a value such as prod now there is a drop down there where you have freeform tags and you have oracle tags oracle tags only have created on and created at like these two timestamps i have no idea what to use those for it looks like that is still in active development but really you just need to conceptually know what tags are and so tags are a way of tagging resources and allows you to use it for cost analysis so now we're going to look at the oracle service called cost analysis so oci cost analysis will help you visualize your ongoing costs you can filter based on compartments tagged resources and start and end date so if you're in your free tier if you use the service it will tell you how much of your credits that you have used up so far so um it's interesting because it's 300 usd but since we use canadian dollars it shows the canadian we get 400 so i feel like they're giving us a little bit more because they rounded it up to 400. uh and then if you want to get a breakdown of your service costs on the righthand side they break it based on categories so compute storage networking and monitoring you can see the exact resource underneath and you get a nice little ticker graph there and as we said in the prior video you can use tags to help narrow down costs but that is the cost analysis service so now we're going to take a look at usage reports so if you want to get a granular view of your spending or find ways to save you can download a csv or use the oci api to access detailed billing information uh and so the cost report uh is automatically generated daily for you and it's stored in an oracle owned object storage bucket so you just go download that csv it's going to be based on that 24 hour history so just mentioning that 24 hours it generally contains 24 hours of data although occasionally a cost report may contain late arriving data that is older than 24 hours um and if what would you do with the csv or the api data you'd have to put in your own visualization tool i mean cost analysis kind of visualizes your information for you but the idea of having this raw data is so that you can put it in your business intelligence tool whatever tool that you want to use for that but the fact is that you have access to that raw data so now let's look at the free tiers and the free tiers is what is going to be free so you can best utilize oracle before you want to start spending money so we have the always free and these are services that are always free month over month so let's talk about them right now so what you'll get is two oracle autonomous databases uh and again autonomous databases are great because they're selfhealing uh they're highly scalable durable et cetera et so a really great database to choose then you have two oci compute vms at 180 cpus ocpus is a oracle term i'm not sure what it is but that's how they calculate cpus and one gigabyte then you have two block volumes for 100 gigabytes in total then you have object store up to 10 gigabytes then you have archive storage up to 10 gigabytes at one load balancer and uh all data in is free so now and then monitoring notifications and then also oci developers so this will automate ci cd workflows i don't know where this is in the interface but they they advertise it on their page and this would be amazing because not having to pay for a ci cd workflow sounds awesome then you have the 30 day free trial so when you sign up you get 300 usd credits if you're in canada apparently it's 400 so that's really nice and it's only valid for 30 days so you get up to eight instances across all available services you get up to five terabytes of storage and those are the two things you want to remember on the tier now this isn't going to be on the exam but if you want to know the full list this is the full list so i actually went through it i was really curious so for compute you get 3005 hours 1.5 terabytes of storage for storage you get five terabytes for containers you get 3500 hours and two terabytes of storage for functions you get 112 uh invokes 20 uh million gigabytes memory second execution time for load bouncer you get 3500 hours for fast connect you get 1 400 hours for oracle weblogic server you get 1 700 hours 250 gigabytes i have an asterisk there because they give you two versions of oracle weblogic server um uh one's like 650 hours but it wasn't clear what the difference was so i'm just listing one of them here if you want to use digital assistant which is a chat bot you get 110 000 requests if you want to use mobile hub that's for building out web applications or mobile applications you get 110 requests if you need a wysiwyg to edit a website you get 400 seven 4 700 hours if you want to use their business intelligence tool for analytics cloud you can use that for 4 700 hours if you want to use their machine learning platform for data science you can use that uh for 4 700 hours there if you want to have a web central portal so this is a secure enterprise portal you get a thousand ten hundred hours if you need application integration so using oc integrations there's 248 hours and if you need to use soa based apis which is super old but there's some enterprises still using it you get 1 700 hours so all this isn't on the exam but it's great to know so you can best utilize the platform so now let's talk about the oracle marketplace so oracle marketplace are managed vm images or stacks from thirdparty vendors that are free or paid that you can launch so a thirdparty vendor you could be launching maybe rocketchat which is like a open source clone of slack maybe you need a gpu from nvidia um and there's security ones and all sorts of ones both from third party and even oracle themselves now if you want to know they can either be free or paid or bring your own license so there's a different few uh pricing options there and they have a lot of different categories so you can see analytics backup and data backup and recovery developer tools operating systems all sorts of things so if you really want to get started very quickly or you just you want to put the responsibility on someone else to manage those vms the oracle marketplace is a great place to take a look at so now we're going to take a look here at the oracle sla so sli stands for service level agreement and it's a guarantee of performance availability manageability of the of the oracle platform uh and oracle defines it as those three categories and if none of this makes sense don't worry we're gonna pull up the website to help understand a bit better so for the availability sla you have a 99.99 uptime for compute running in one ad region with measurements of regent unavailability uh we get 99.95 uptime compute in multiple fds those are fault domains in a single ad availability domain and so for uh for the availability when we're looking at compute uh and notice it says 10 and 25 10 and 25 that is the sla breach i'm not exactly sure what it means but you need to know the numbers at least face value for the exam so for uh region unavailability you're going to see that it's 99.9 for uh region unavailability for compute it's 99.9 but for block volumes it's 99 and then uh for availability domains on availability at 10 and 25 we get that 99.95 percent and then 99 which is described up in the in that uh area above right now for some other services um under availability uh for object storage and fast connect it's 99.9 and 99 for 10 and 25 percent respectively you're gonna see those numbers repeated so there's just that one exception with computes that it's a bit more complicated now looking at the manageability slas uh what we have here for compute block volumes and databases is 99.9 for for sla breach of 10 percent and 99 for sla breach of 25 percent then for performance slas uh for compute block volumes and database uh it's 99.9 for 10 percent and sla breach for 25 so you're seeing a bit of a pattern here so the thing i want you to remember is that if the sla breaches 10 with the exception availability compute it's going to be 99.9 percent and for a breach of 25 it's going to be 99 so you know just have that uh in consideration so here i am at the oracle website pulling up the sla agreements and i just wanted to show you um all these all the numbers that i was getting that information for you there so you can see that it's broken down by service then there are these measurements we didn't cover the measurements because they're not going to be not going to show up in the exam they're hard to remember and all you really need to know is like what at 10 or 25 percent what are the percentages that is the guarantee of uptime but you can see here for availability we have region unavailability availability domains api error rate for manageability it's all api error rate for performance it's disk iops and network performance and then there are some faqs here which should not show up on the exam but they are a bit interesting to read through if you are curious um but yeah there you go i just wanted to make sure that i could point this resource if you wanted to read a little bit more about it so let's talk about service limits for a moment here so when you sign up for oci a set of service limits is configured for your tenancy and the service limits is the quota or allowance of set on resources so you're going to actually have hard limits of how many servers you can spin up and utilize some things so for example your tendencies allow the maximum number of compute instances per ad a lot of times there's you can only have two um at the start especially when you're in your sandbox these limits are generally established with oracle sales representatives when you purchase oci if you do not establish limits with your oracle sales rep or if you signed up through the portal default or trial limits are set for your tenancy which is probably the case for you these limits may be increased for you automatically based on your oci resource usage and account standing you can request a service limit increase so that is the key thing you want to remember you can request a service limit increase if you cannot spin up more servers so let's talk about support for oci uh so from what i could tell they call it premier support uh and for the only part of information i thought was valuable to say was that uh they have rapid resolution for 24 7 access to the oracle knowledge base technical support and priority service request handling remote diagnostic with twohour onsite hardware service um and if you're in the oracle console there is a live chat and i actually opened it up to ask what the support plans were and i literally was asked what do you mean and then they said you should go contact a sales rep to get a quote so it's strange because in the exam guide says you're supposed to know the support plans but the support plan is go call a support rep and i can't imagine anyone would do that so this is all that i know but we'll pull up the um support premiere page here in a moment just to see if we can see if there's anything else that is interesting to look at so i've gone here and i've opened up oracle support and this is the only support that i can find that is relevant to premiere or sorry to oracle cloud and so they say find out more about premiere support and then here we get a bunch of information that doesn't really tell us anything um you know there's software and systems and things like that so it's i'm not particularly sure um in terms of what they offer for support i imagine because they're enterprise you do have to call them and find out but yeah just if you are curious and you want to poke around and see if you can find something else that i didn't there you go so let's take a look at the shared security model and this is a very important concept to understand because it tells you what oracle is responsible for and what you the customer are responsible for in terms of securing your workloads and data so oci is going to be responsible for all the managed software and services that they offer so that could be compute uh storage databases and networking that is not the full spectrum of services but those are the the core four that i always say that uh is the ones that they are are responsible for then you have your hardware and your global infrastructure so the regions that are responsible for uh the data centers that are in there the availability domains those are the data centers themselves and then the physical security of those data centers um so you know if it's hardware or if it's the location or the it people that manage that infrastructure oci is going to take care of that for you now as the customer you are responsible for the configuration of managed services or thirdparty software so if you are using a particular platform or application or let's say you're creating new users or and you're giving them permissions in in iam it's your responsibility to configure those correctly and if you make a misconfiguration it's going to be on you then there's the configuration of the virtual infrastructure and systems so this could be the a virtual operating system that you have the virtual networking that you have to configure or the firewalls that you configure at your networking level then next we have security configuration of data so if you have data you have to decide whether you need to use clientside data encryption a lot of cloud services will let you check box that on and they might not be checked box on by default so that's something you have to double check then there's server side encryption then there is protecting your network traffic so that is putting uh services in control or monitoring tools to make sure that you're monitoring the traffic that is going through your environment and then last but not least but the most important is customer data you're responsible for the customer data so any data that you put on the platform you have to make sure that it is secure so that is the shared security model so now let's talk about iam so im stands for identity and access management and its a service that lets you control who has access to your cloud resources and so there are some components of iem that we need to know the first one are users so when you create your oracle account you're going to want to create users so people have access to your oracle resources so a user would be an individual employee or system that needs to manage or use oci resources then you have groups so groups is a collection of users who who all need the same type of access to set uh to to a set of resources or compartments then you have dynamic groups so dynamic groups is a special type of group that contains resources that match rules that you define if this is not clear don't worry we're going to go through how to make a policy and this will make it very clear and then we have policies so this is a language that defines permissions so if a user group or dynamic group or compartment should be allowed to access specific ocr resources within your account and one thing i want to note that if you've ever used any other cloud provider oci is a bit different in that you don't when you create a resource um or a user a group you don't assign at the time of creation a precreated policy you just create the policy and it's in effect uh and this really confused me because i was looking forever in the console saying okay how do you sign it and so you just create the policy and it's in effect so hopefully that will be clear as we work our way through this stuff so what i want to do now to really help you understand i am policies i just want to show you some common examples of what that language would look like so this is the language or syntax so you have this allow subject to verb resource types in location where conditions and we're going to be going through all of these uh little bracketed areas so that you really understand but i just want to show you some common examples first so let's say you wanted to allow users to analyze the costs for your team so you do allow you would say the the budget team group is allowed to read only the usage reports which is the resource type in the tenancy so that's our root component uh next we have uh letting database admins manage db system so we're going to allow the database admin groups to manage the database family so any type of database within oracle in our tennessee or root account or root compartment then we have let users download objects from the object storage buckets so we're going to allow group object readers to read buckets in compartments in the compartment called a b whatever a b means uh so those are the common policy examples but i just want to show you that oracle has a huge list of policy examples on the on their website so i'm just going to pull that up here in a moment so here are those common policies i was talking about and i actually pulled those examples i showed you from this list so here's a big big list so if you're never sure what it is that you need to write in here you can go here so let's users create a volume group and they'll explain uh where to create the policy and what it would do but there's examples for you so i just wanted you to be aware that there was this big large list and all you had to do is google common policies to find it so i'm going to really help you understand how policies work by looking at the autonomy of a policy so what we're going to do is we're going to work through i don't know what they call those nouns or actions but all those brackets we're going to look at the examples of what we can do there so you have a better idea how you can use these policies do you have to know how to write policies for the exam no but it's a very good practical skill and it's good to learn it at the foundational level so that's why we're doing it so the first thing we're going to look at is the subject so a subject could be anything in your system so if you wanted to specify everything you do any user or you could specify i am group name or oc id so it could be group developers or group id and the oc id for that group that you want and then you could specify dynamic groups so it's the same thing as a group name you just say dynamic group tagged prod next we have verbs so a verb could be either inspect read use or manage and so if you want to only allow someone to list resources we would use inspect and oci recommends this is only for thirdparty auditors if you had uh only want to give people read access you do read and that would be generally for internal auditors if you wanted to give someone the ability to read and update but not delete or create resources you would use and that would be great for uh junior developers but they just say developers and if you want the ability to read create update or delete so be basically be able to do anything you would set it as manage and so that would be your administrators next we have resource types so if you want to specify all resource types you would just say all resources if you wanted to specify individual types such as only access to buckets or only access to route tables or only access to a particular type of servers than you do individual types but sometimes individual types can be a bit cumbersome so you might want to include everything uh within a category which they call family so maybe you want to say all types of databases or all types of servers or all types of storage volume so database family would be all databases there that you could put in there next would be the location so uh this could be the tenancy so that's your route com compartment maybe you want to specify a single compartment such as compartment development or compartment production or maybe you want to specify based on the compartment's oc id and then last is conditions and we have a lot of options here for conditions so we could match based on a string so we could say where target group dot name equals staging you could say you could match based on a regex so we only want to match target groups that have a customer and then we have not so this could be target group name so as long as it's not beta then we won't use the beta one then you can do it all so that's where you can actually have multiple statements condition statements so you have one where it's it's developer but you don't want to be production and then you have any so this could be when any of the statements are true so if you don't want it to be project a and we don't want it to be project b so maybe we wanted to be project c so you know hopefully that gives you a bit of an idea on how to uh construct a policy but you know to really understand you're gonna have to get some practical knowledge in there so now let's talk about mfa and mfa is short for multifactor authentication it is a security control where after you fill in your username email and password you have to use a second device such as a phone to confirm that it's you logging in why would you want this well mfa protects against people who have stolen your password so if someone gets your username and password how would you know that like how does the system know if it's actually you and so this additional step when you're dealing with cloud infrastructure you definitely want to have mfa turned on and you can turn mfa on in most platforms so whether it's you're using aws oracle gcp or even if you're using facebook you can turn it on so the way it works is uh you have your uh your login so my my email my password and then what you do is you have a an app installed on your phone that is for mfa and it would give you a code so the code here would be 439 691 and you'd have to enter that code back into like as a second step after your login and that would make sure 100 percent that it is you who is logging in because the person who stole your password doesn't have your phone so they don't have that second factor so the first factor is your email and the second factor could be a device such as your phone that has mfa installed on it another device you could use is called an ubi key and so if you've ever turned on mfa on facebook it's really annoying because you have to pull up your phone unless you're already on your phone um but a newbie key is is looks like this little flash drive and you leave it plugged in your computer and it automatically enters in the second step for you so that it's just as easy as logging in and the great thing about this key is you can just take it with use uh so a lot of people will put it around their neck on a chain but that is what mfa is so now we're going to look at the concept of federation so federation identity is the ability to enable users from one domain to securely access data or systems of another domain without the need of a redundant user administrator if you're looking at that word domain and wondering what it means domain could just mean like your office and then another domain would be like oracle cloud so the idea is that um your office has given you a username and password to log in to your your your office network and you want to use those credentials other places so let's give an example as to why this would be useful so if you're a large company and you purchase multiple commercial and enterprise software products or services such as oracle cloud wouldn't it be convenient if the employee only had to log into their work computer and they had access to all these software products and services without having to log it again that concept is called single signon so single signon is technology that enables users to authenticate without the need to log in or have separate pair of credentials to thirdparty systems another concept we need to know is idp so identity identity provider so identity provider is a trusted provider of your user identity that lets you authenticate to access other services so identity provider could be microsoft active directory if you're in the enterprise world you've definitely heard of active directory also abbreviated as ad uh okata octa i don't know how to pronounce it but that is an enterprise identity provider but even facebook is an identity provider if you've ever went on a website that says log in with facebook that's an identity provider facebook is providing your identity so that you can gain access to things other ones could be amazon google twitter github linkedin and even oracle has their own it's called oracle identity cloud service so those are the three things you need to understand what is the federation identity single signon and on an idp so let's talk about encryption or security for the storage of our data and so for data we have block volume file storage object storage and then any database service um and so let's walk through this stuff so for block volumes uh by default we're gonna get encryption at rest so if you create a block volume file storage or object storage your data at rest is already encrypted so that's data that's just sitting on that drive on the server it's encrypted then you have encryption and transit that means when the data leaves the actual storage device to go to a server whatever is that traffic encrypted by default and it is for block volume and file storage uh you can also bring your own keys so uh the thing is is that for encryption at rest or in transit you're going to be using some kind of encryption key but if you have you want to bring your own you can definitely do that for block volume and file storage and then for object storage if you want to also be able to secure your buckets buckets is what they call folders for object storage you can make a private bucket and then for database services is a bit different they have tde data safe and database vault and if you're wondering what those are we'll talk about them right away so tde is transparent data encryption it's a technology employed by microsoft ibm and oracle to encrypt database files then you have oracle data safe is it's a security control that monitors sensitive data such as oci databases so it's not exclusive to the database service but our database services but that's what we generally use it for and then you have oracle database vault so this restricts access to specific areas in your oracle database from any user including users who have administrative access so there you go and we'll talk a little bit more about data safe things so we briefly mentioned at rest and in transit encryption but i didn't really explain to you what those are so let me tell you what they are right now so address encryption address encryption is securing data that is not moving encrypting a hard drive would be considered at rest encryption so you'd use something like the key pair to encrypt your data and a cryptographic algorithm such as ae256 but the key thing i want you to take away is that at rest encryption is when you're securing data when it's not moving then there's intransit encryption and this is ensuring your data uh that while it's moving from location to another location that it's secure and if you're using intransit encryption a protocol like ssl http or tls would be used ssl is very common if you've ever seen that little lock in your web browser that is using ssl so there you go those two terms so let's talk about um oracle's data safe uh service so oracle data save is a unified control center for your oracle databases and what it looks like is this it's a bunch of graphs and it gives you a very clear picture of the security um of your actual uh databases so some things that it can do it helps you understand the sensitivity of your data evaluate risks to your data mass if you need to mask sensitive data you can do that you can implement and monitor security controls it has access or assesses user security it monitors user activity and addresses compliance requirements so this is very interesting because i've yet to see such a service on aws or other providers uh so you know oracle is known for databases and so this is one of the the stronger services they have uh in their uh in their cloud so you know that's data so let's talk about compliance programs so if you want to sell to an enterprise company or a government uh uh body they will not buy your software unless it is secure and so the question i pose to you is how are you going to meet their security compliance requirements so they'll say we'll only do business with you if you are nist 853 compliant so that would be the icon there pipeda compliant that is a government compliance program or hipaa compliant so hipaa would be um if you want to do medicine it stands for health something something american something and then you have fips 140 hyphen 2 compliant and this is the way you handle encryption keys uh so the idea is that there's all these compliance programs and uh oci is compliant with them so if you do need to meet these comp compliance programs to get the business with the governments or large enterprises that is one of the strong advantages of the cloud and i'll see if i can pull up a page that shows all the compliance programs on their website so here i'm on the oracle website here i just search for compliance programs or up here it says cloud infrastructure compliance and these are all the compliance programs that they are meeting on their platforms so their infrastructure meets those requirements so we have sock system organization controls one two three uh we have one for the united kingdom cloud security principles there's that canadian one we saw um they have a bunch so hip uh hipaa so health insurance portability and accountability act i thought one was called amer american in there but it is an american act then we have gdpr you or we have fedramp but you don't need to know the names of all these it's good to know what hipaa is it's good to know um what dci uh pci dess payment card industry data security standards so if you're handling um credit cards online you generally need to be pci dss compliant um but yeah this is just and i just showing you all these compliance programs and i feel like you could expand this and it would tell you a bit more it'll tell you what the program is about and what infrastructure actually is meeting those requirements so hopefully that gives you an idea what compliance programs are and why you care should care about them so let's talk about oci vault so oc vault makes it easy for you to create and control rotate encryption keys used to encrypt data on oci oci vault was previously known as oci key management or i think they abbreviate it as kms uh at least that's what i think so just be aware if we're talking about vault or key management it's the same thing oci vault is a multitenant cloud hsm if you're wondering what an hsm is hsm stands for hardware security module it's a piece of hardware designed to store encryption keys and uh the reason why you want to use a cloud hsm or a hardware security module is that it meets a compliance program such as fips 140 hyphen 2. so we talked about compliance programs prior and this would be a way to be compliant with this program um and so and yeah the key thing here is that it's multitenant so that means multiple customers are sharing the cost if you had to buy that piece of hardware outright it's at least a thousand dollars just for the hardware so you can see how this is extremely cost effective using oci vault and you're still compliant so let's talk about os management so os management is a oracle service that allows you to manage update and patch your virtual machines operating systems running on uh your oracle cloud so i like to think of os management as a toolbox for your vms so that's an easy way to remember what it is so let's talk about the features of os management and what it can do for you so one thing you can do is it can search install and remove linux packages for you it can uh search a faculty or a facility that you can use to check individual cve so common vulnerabilities and exposures to determine level exposure in your tenancy uh so exposure meaning like as someone trying to do malicious things like trying to exploit security vulnerabilities within your vms then you have software sources this is specific to linux but you can add or delete software sources to provide packages to instances to track available updates to those packages so it's not necessarily the installation or removing or searching packages it's the the sources of those packages then you have managed instance groups this enables you to group your instances together for updates uh the purpose of this would be like let's say you want to apply patches to this set of servers you can do that you can schedule jobs so you can execute one time a single job so let's say you wanted to download the application logs because you need to debug a problem on your production server then you have work requests this is just like scheduled jobs so you execute a job but it's based on a schedule so maybe every every day you want to back up some very specific system files and the last thing is you're going to get metrics and alarms you can create alarms such as when it's time to apply a security update so that is os management so let's talk about ddos protection on oci so before we do let's make sure we understand what ddos is so a ddos attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic by flooding a website with large amounts of fake traffic and so i have a nice little diagram to show you here so imagine you have a server and imagine it's not on oracle or any other cloud providers just you have it somewhere hosted and somebody decides that they want to attack you they want to flood you with a bunch of traffic so they have their own server you don't know where it is but they have that server and what they do is they can control multiple remote servers which we might call slaves and what these servers are going to do is they're going to send fake traffic so they're going to pretend each server could pretend that they're a thousand people and so if you have a you know 20 servers pertaining they're each a thousand then you send out all those fake uh traffic uh over the internet and as it goes over the internet it's a bit harder to figure out where that traffic's coming from and all those ip addresses are spoofed anyway so we have no idea if the ips are really real and then you get that flood of traffic and when you get all that traffic hitting your server it makes it to become unavailable becomes unavailable because it can't handle the amount of traffic that's coming in it's like imagine you're getting lots of phone calls you can only handle so much at a given time um and so you so real users can't reach your website and that's what a ddos attack is but by having your server just within oci on the oci network you automatically uh get builtin support for ddos protection so there's different types of ddos so for layers three and four it's going to protect a guns flood attacks for layer seven you'd use a waff or some other tools we're not going to talk about the layers too much here but i just want you to know that there's builtin ddos protection when you use your server on oci so let's take a look at what a web application firewall does so oci has their own it's called oci waff and that protects your web app against common web exploits so oseiwaf sits between your server and incoming traffic and filters out https traffic um this is known as layer 7. i know i'm not talking too much about the layers you just need to know that it's layer 7 and it decides that it is unwanted based on managed or custom configured rules so oci has rules that are going to say this is bad traffic or you can set your own and so here's an architectural diagram you have a server sitting in your vcn a virtual cloud network and then you have oci sitting in between the incoming traffic and the traffic that's supposed to reach your server and it's going to decide if it's good or bad based on those rules now if you're wondering like what are good rules for waff like to filter on generally they follow owasp's top ten so you might have never heard of a wasp their logo is a wasp but it stands for the open web application security project so this is a project that is from a nonprofit organization and what they've done is they've detailed all the possible common attacks that can happen and how to prevent them and so that is the basis of the majority of waffs out there whether it's oracle or any other they'll always go back to this list but this really gives you a clear idea as to what you need to protect against so there you go that is wab all right so i'm going to show you how to get started by setting up your first oracle cloud account so what i want you to do is in the top right corner go to try oracle cloud free tier there might be another button somewhere else but we'll go here and then we'll hit start for uh start for free and then it's going to ask us to choose our country i am in canada so we will type in canada here and then we'll choose our email i'm going to choose android exam pro.co i'm not sure if i've already made an account but i guess we'll find out it's going to ask us between a company and a and personal use i'm going to stick with personal use i'm going to say exam pro uh and then we'll drop down and we get to choose our region um we could choose uh well we want to do the free tier i guess it's only free for particular tiers even though i'm in canada toronto i'm going to choose ashburn this is where the most available servers are going to be and then i need to fill out my account information um so i'm just going to go here and fill all that out okay okay and so now all my uh personal details are filled in here um you're not gonna be able to see them because i blank them out and we'll go ahead and we'll verify our phone number so we now just have to enter in the code that it has given us so i'm just gonna check my phone here to see if i received a code and i have so i'm just going to go ahead and fill that in so that's 1 4 9 5 0 2 4. go ahead and verify that code and so now we need to put in a password so i'm just going to go ahead and fill in a password great and so now that i meet all the password requirements i should go ahead here and go to payment information and i hear it's just saying that i need to add a credit card but i won't be charged unless i'd like to upgrade my account so go ahead and i'll go and add my credit card and so here we can see my payment information is being repeated so i'm just going to scroll down and so now we need to choose a payment type so i'm just going to fill that in and now i have that filled in i'm just going to hit finish and so now we're just going to get a confirmation here so i'm going to hit confirm and so now this has created my account so i can go ahead and just log in with my password so we'll go ahead and log in and here we are we're in my account so this is the oracle console and you can see that we're under a trial for 30 days and if we we can upgrade to get access to more things so there you go so that that's all it takes to create an account so one of the first things we should do in our account is set up mfa so i'm going to set up mfa for my root account here so what we'll do is we'll go to the top right corner here go to profile we're going to go to user settings and we have this button here this is enable multifactor authentication i'm going to go ahead and click that and what that's going to do it's going to give us this qr code and so what you're going to need is you're going to install the oracle mobile authenticator or a similar application i believe you can use google's authenticator but this is a separate application you have to install on your phone so you have to go to the google play store or or whichever or whichever store is on your phone and so i'm just pulling mine up right now so i have authenticator and in authenticator i i can click um a plus button it says scan a barcode and i'm just going to hold up my phone to that barcode and then it's going to add it and so now it's had it's now added it and it's going to ask me to enter in the numbers i see on my phone so i'm going to enter it in so i got 421908 and i'm going to hit enter and now i have multifactor authentication so the next time i log in to my account i'm going to have to use authenticator to enter in those numbers so my account is secure and that's how you set up mfa if you have a business account it's a little bit different and i think we do have instructions on that on our website but yeah for your personal account that's all you have to do to set up mfa so now we're going to look at setting up a user account within our oracle cloud so if you aren't on this home screen just always click the logo oracle cloud here uh if you are lost from the last video what i want you to do is open the hamburger menu go down to identity and go to users and so what we can do is we can add more users to our account so i'm going to hit create users i'm going to make one for baker who's my cofounder he's also named andrew so that's why we call him bako from his last name and i need to confirm the email um i guess you can't have a space we'll look at some advanced options we can tag him we'll go ahead here and create oh i'll just say cofounder and so now i've created a bacon account and i'll just click into him here and he's never logged in but we can enable mfa for him but i guess he would have to do it himself because he would have to add his phone we can create and reset his password we can edit him as a user some basic information so that's how easy it is to create a user so we'll just go back here to oracle cloud and we'll move on to the next step so now that we have a user let's go ahead and uh put them in a group so we'll go up to the hamburger menu go back down to identity we'll go to groups and we'll create a group and we're going to call this group developers and maybe we'll capitalize it because our other one has a capital on it doesn't matter so these are developer group and we'll go ahead here and create that group so now we have created that group let's go ahead and add baco to that developer group so i'll click in here and then we'll just hit add user to group and we'll choose our user so we'll choose baco and i'll hit add and so now they're added to that group and the reason why we want to add people to groups is so that we can apply policies so that they have limitations on what they can do within the platform but we'll go back to oracle cloud and that's all you have to do to create a group so now let's go ahead and create a compartment a compartment allows us to group resources together and apply permissions just like how groups allow us to apply permissions to users so go back up to the hamburger menu go down to identity and choose compartments we already have a compartment it's our root compartment it's named after our account but we want to make our our own so we'll hit create compartment we'll call it development we'll have to give it a description as development again it's going to be the parents going to be uh the the root one because you can nest these six levels down but we just need one we'll go ahead and hit create compartment so now we've created ourselves a compartment and that's all we had to do here so let's go back to oracle cloud and we'll move on to the next so now let's go ahead and create a policy a policy is going to help us limit access to resources so people don't have access to things they shouldn't have so what i want you to do is go back up to the hamburger menu go down to identity and then what we're going to do is we're going to choose policies now policies are interesting because the way they are applied is that you don't apply you don't make a policy and then say assign to user as soon as you make them they're assigned so now that we're here we need to choose a compartment so it says view and manage pick a compartment resource type so we'll drop this down here oh over here and we're going to choose um example root and we're going to go ahead and create ourselves a new policy so i'm going to name this policy i'm going to say developer access so we'll see developers and now we need to write our statement and so i have a statement here i'm just gonna write it out so we're gonna say allow group developers to manage all resources in compartment development and so if i name that all right i believe i gave that a capital d i don't know if it's case sensitive and we're going to go ahead there and create that policy and so that's all it takes to make a a policy uh and to really test it uh you know baker would have to use this account and he would have to see if he had access or if he didn't i believe that when you make new user accounts by default they don't have any access until they are part of the statement group so everything is deny by default and then you add things to allow but that's all it takes to create a policy we're gonna go back to oracle cloud and we're done with this section so in order for us to launch resources uh in oracle we're going to need a vcn and so what we're going to do is go up to the hamburger menu make our way over to networking and go to vcns which stands for virtual cloud networks and we have two options we can create a vcn from scratch or we can start a start one with the vcn wizard i'm going to use the wizard and so we have two options vcm with internet connectivity or vcm with internet connectivity site to site vpn connect this sounds really great if we had something a bit more complicated like connecting to an onpremise network as the image shows but we want something simple here so i'm going to hit start vcn wizard and that's going to create us a bunch of resources so we'll just name our vcn as myvcn it's automatically filled in us a cider block so we have 10.0.0.16 and then what we have here is the subnets so it's going to create as a public subnet and a private subnet and as you remember from my tutorial guide uh you always want your subnets to cider block to be smaller than your vcn because it's taking a slice out of it now it looks confusing because 24 is larger than 16 but the larger the number is the smaller the slice okay and then we'll just scroll on down here so it says dns resolution we definitely want that we'll just scroll down uh this all looks great and we'll go ahead and hit next but before we do just look it's going to create us a vcn a public subnet a private subnet the internet gateway a nat gateway and a service gateway so we'll go ahead and hit next and then we'll go ahead and hit create so we'll just wait for those to create and so there you go they're all have been created so we'll go view virtual cloud network and so now we have our own vcn where we can start launching resources within and that's going to allow us to set up our own server so i'm going to go up here to oracle cloud and that's what we'll do we'll launch a server next so what we're going to do now is set up our own server so what i want you to do is go to the hamburger menu at the top we're going to go to compute we're going to go to instances we're going to create ourselves a new instance now it gives us a randomly generated name which is fine we can choose the os that we want so the oracle has their own version of linux if we hit change we have a bunch of options we can choose from such as partner images or maybe you have your custom images but we're just going to stick with the oracle version then in order for us to launch this we're going to actually need to upload an ssh key but before we do that let's just look at some of the options here so we can change the availability domain we can choose the size of instance they call them shapes so if we open up change shape we have different sizes we can even choose the provider for the for that you can choose bare metal if you want or go virtual and we're not we might not be seeing all the options because we are in the trial account so if we upgrade we probably would see a lot more options but what we'll do we'll just hide that there and what we need is we need a private and public key and this is a little bit hard because oracle doesn't give you a button just to generate them here so what you have to do is you have to create your own key pair and they do have this nice page on how to do whether you're on windows or if you're on um on linux or mac so i'm right now i'm on a windows machine so i would have to use putty so you'd have to go ahead and install putty once you've installed it you'd search for puttygen and again all these instructions are here so if you are a bit lost look for creating a key pair under the oracle cloud infrastructure documentation and it's under the getting started section okay but here i have uh putty and what it wants it wants us to create an ssh to rsa so it says find it okay specify a type of key so in the key menu confirm the default is rsa ssh key and this is a bit confusing because i'm looking at putty right here right now oh i had an old one open and i'm not seeing that so oh i guess you drop it down from there so it says ssh hyphen 2 rsa key type for the type of key generate accept the default key value as rsa so that's what's set as set the number of bits generated to 2048 so it's already set to 240048 and then click generate then when you need to move your mouse a bit that actually helps it generate random data and then it's going to say so it says move your mouse around when the key is generated appears under the public key for pacing ossh so it's just talking about that leave the key the passphrase blank we're going to do that save the private key and click yes um and then the key pair saved and putty which will be proprietary you can name the key anything you want it's ppka select all the generated keys and appears under the public key for pasting ossh do not save the public key because it does not save the key in the open ssh format okay so we'll go ahead and we will save our private key and we'll say yes because it's okay if we leave it blank we'll go to desktop i'm just going to name this as um oracle exam pro and it's going to name it as a dot ppk we'll hit save and so now we just need to grab the public key which is apparently this here so we'll go ahead and copy that out it's a bit easier on a mac because you just run the um a single command which is i'm sure it shows in here for linux and mac and so we'll go back over here yeah see that's what it is for mac you just run that line we'll go back over here and we can choose or paste we're gonna i think we just paste it in here we'll go ahead and hit create and hopefully that will work and there we go so it's creating our instance and it's starting up so now we just have to wait for it to provision i'm not sure how long it takes it shouldn't take too long but we'll just wait a little bit here so after waiting uh about five minutes our server is now running it's gone green and so i just wanted to show you a few things here so over here we have vnic so that's the virtual network interface card that is attached to this you can see that we want to get instant access you're connected a running instance using a shell we could connect so that's why we made our private and public key there we can see our shape configuration that we chose if we scroll down here and we go to boot volume you can see that it created us a boot volume and it's attached it looks like there's a console connection so this might be a convenient way to connect to the instance here you can set up work requests um so we can see that it created an instance so it shows us some history there um but yeah that's the instance there so yeah there we go so now that we're done with this instance let's go ahead and just terminate it so we'll go to actions and we'll hit terminate and we'll permanently delete the boot volume because we're done with that all right so there you go now if you wanted to make a database it's not going to be that much different you could do autonomous i think we get two for free so we just go ahead here i'm not going to go through the whole process i just want to quickly show you that the way you'd set up a database is you choose the database or the the transaction processing or the shared infrastructure you fill in your username password and etc you can bring your own license or license and create your database that way so i just wanted to quickly show you that but we'll make our way back to the compute instance and we can see that it's terminating it's going to take a little bit of time but if we see that we know that it's terminating we don't have to worry about it so i think we're all good for that so i just click back the home here and this section is done all right so i'm going to show you how to uh create your own bucket and start using object storage so we'll go all the way up here um to the hamburger menu and we're going to go to object storage and we're going to choose object storage what we're going to do is create ourselves a bucket and then we'll name the bucket whatever we want and we'll go ahead and we can enable object versioning we don't need to do that you'll notice that we can use the oracle manage keys to encrypt it but by default it is encrypted we can choose standard or archive archive is going to help us save more money if we choose that go ahead and create that bucket and so now we can click into that bucket and if we want to upload objects we just have to click upload so i'm just going to upload something from my desktop so let's go upload ourselves an object so we'll go to upload object i happen to have an image of the enterprise d that i want to upload so i'll just place it there i'm going to call that enterprise d we can see if there's a few other options here so we can just change the metadata and response header i'm just going to leave that all alone we'll hit upload and it uploaded was very fast okay and so there's our object and so on the left hand side we do have some other options such as metrics so we can see bucket size and number of objects we have preauthenticated requests so if objects are private and we want to give people access to it i assume we could use that there are work requests work request is a feature of management os so i'm not sure how that fits in lifecycle policies you could create a rule probably to move it to archive so imagine that you had a like a lot of files and you needed to move them into archive so that you could hold onto them for seven years but you wanted to move an archive so that you're saving money that's what you use a life cycle policy for there's a replication policy replication would be for um backing up your data in another region so if this region for whatever reason uh suffered a disaster you would lose your data but if you replicated it into another region uh you wouldn't have that issue there then we have retention rules this sounds like that you can decide whether to delete files over time so by time bound or indefinite so it says object delete a modification is prevented from the retention during period so you can say you're not allowed to delete a file for this period of time so imagine that you are you have accounting files you have to hold on for seven years you could say hold on to these for seven years or you could say indefinite never never delete these files so hopefully that gives you an idea of object storage i'm going to go ahead here and delete this object but that's as simple as it is so there we go so now let's take a look at launching a database or at least look at the options because oracle is known for databases and they have quite a few options we have the autonomous data warehouse the autonomous transactional processing bare metal vm exudate exadata data safe which is for visualizing whether our data is safe nosql database and mysql where we have db systems and it can do backups we'll go to the autonomous data warehouse and it doesn't really matter what we choose because i think when we choose it it allows us to choose these two options and right now i'm under baker's account but let's say we want to do transactional processing so that's an oltp we want to be shared so that it's it's more cost effective and we want to use the free tier always free resources can be created in both free tier and paid so we'll check box that on if you're if you're always free tier has no activity seven days the database will automatically stop so they don't want us to really use it if we're not we can choose our database version apparently there's only one we have auto scaling we could turn that on so our database automatically scales um it's not let me checkbox it so i don't know there our admin credentials is going to be admin apparently we can't change that and we're just going to set this a password i'm going to do testing one two three um for one two three abc exclamation um testing one two three abc oh it's making this really hard for me uh uh contain at least one uppercase lowercase one number cannot use double quotations okay so i say testing abc all caps one two three testing abc one two three and we'll just look here configure access control rules um i don't know if we need to do any of that i guess we could restrict based on ip to say only this person from this ip so like my only my home address is allowed to access the server and we're gonna use license included i'm gonna look at some advanced options we just have some tags we'll go ahead and hit create autonomous database and so it's going to start provisioning that instance and so we're just gonna wait and i'll see you back here in a moment so after a short wait our autonomous database is all ready and running and we have some options here we can scale up and scale down which is kind of cool we can restart it we could create a clone we could add access control list we could reset the password and we can do a db connection so let's go ahead and click that so here it says to download the client credentials download the wallet so we can go ahead there and download that i'm not going to go do that we have metrics down below if we have backups we could see them here we can make a manual backup whenever we just click that put the name in and it would create a backup creating backups can be a little bit slow so i don't want to do it and i think right now we'd have to upgrade to use this feature so we're not going to be able to do any backups let's go to the tools and so in tools we have sql developer web oracle ml user administrator oracle application express and soda drivers i think this might give us an interface i'm just going to go ahead here and click that and see what we get and we'll just wait here a little bit and so here we are in the sql developer i wonder if it's the same if i go admin testing abc123 and there we are and we're actually in our database so that's really nice because it allows us to directly work with our database has a data modeler that sounds really cool um so i'm just clicking around here so i'm not exactly sure how this works but it's kind of cool that we have this interface here that's built in i haven't seen this with any other provider i assume we just start writing sql so you say select all or show tables i can't say i really know my oracle i know my mysql pretty well but we launched an oracle autonomous instance okay so i didn't see any output there but it's nice to see that we have that as an option um but yeah that is launching a database so let's go ahead and we'll just shut down this database because we're done with it we'll just say terminate type in the database name to confirm termination are you sure you want to name it here they put it there so you can just copy paste it like that that is a very nice name for a database and that's terminating so that's all we have to do and so that's databases so if you're ever wondering uh like how you can determine uh who is doing what within your account uh there's a service uh for oracle called audit so what i want you to do is go to your hamburger menu we're going to go down to security or sorry i can't remember what it's under here governance and we're going to go to audit and so what audit allows us to do it allows us to see what's been going on within our account so if we wanted to find out who did what that's how we could do it you could drop it down based on their action types filter but based on keywords but we can just scroll down here and eventually you'll see my names you can see that i was in the database service so i was looking at the database service deciding whether i wanted to start a server and then if we keep on going down we probably would see that i was trying to launch a server but yeah if you're just trying to figure out who did what in the system that is what audit does okay that's just good to know all right i just want to show you another thing with billing that is something you should probably do so if you go to the hamburger menu here and we're going to go to account management and we go to budgets we can set a budget and a budget's really good because it's going to help us make sure that we are keeping track of our costs so i've already created a budget here called the overall budget and it can show us that we had spent a hundred dollars and our spend so far is four dollars and fifty four cents and that's how much of our spend period that has occurred so far and that's how much it forecasts it's going to happen um in the future let's go ahead and create ourselves a new budget we can say another budget and you can do it based on compartment or a tag it's probably going to ask us for a description so you choose your component you say a hundred dollars you can choose the threshold so actual span versus forecast you could choose the threshold being 50 percent this is going to determine when it actually emails you to say hey your budget is approaching and then you put your email in here and that way you'd get an email about it so i'll go ahead and create ourselves a budget um a budget already exists for this component so i guess you can only make one uh per compartment all right and so i just made another one there but i don't really need another one so i'm going to go ahead and delete that but yeah you should definitely set up a budget because you want to keep on top of your cost so that you don't get over billed and so there you go okay so now what i want to do to show you a little bit about building um so i actually switched over to baker's account because um he actually has some spend out of his free tier you can see over here on the right hand side it says he spent four dollars so far and he has four days for his um his trial to end but what we'll do is we'll go to the hamburger menu up here we're going to scroll all the way down and we're going to go to account management and we're going to go to cost analysis and this will show us our free trial again so it's the same information there it tells us to upgrade but it's also going to give us a breakdown of compute block storage networking etc so here we can see those costs in detail so i just really wanted to show you that so you know where you can analyze your costs so now we're going to look at booking our exam and so the test center network that is associated with oracle is called pearson view and they do both in data center and also proctored exams proctored meaning from the comfort of your own home and that's all up to you but if we want to go start taking an exam what we can do is go to test takers and click on schedule an exam then we can search uh the type of certification we want so i'll type in oracle and we'll click here and then from there what we'll have to do is go and create ourselves an account or sign in i don't have an account so we'll go ahead and hit create account we're going to have to click i agree um indicate that you've read the terms we'll scroll all the way down the bottom check box that i agree so what we'll have to do is fill in our personal information so i'm just going to scroll through this so you can see so you have to put your title your first name middle name last name suffix and then your email so i'm going to go ahead and do that do you know of an oracle testing id no i do not know my oracle testing id so i am mr andrew william charles brown i don't have a suffix we'll go ahead here and i'll just say andrew at exam pro dot co andrew at exam pro dot co uh and sure i'll receive some marketing messages that looks good to me there's four steps personal information contact information additional information and create an account so hit next for create an account or the next step and what we need to do is we need to fill in our personal contact information so i'm going to say i'm from home and i'm in canada and i'm just going to fill in the rest of my information here great and now that i've filled in my personal uh address here i'm just going to scroll down and i just need to fill in my phone number and choose my corresponding language and we can go to next and now it's going to ask me if i'm part of the oracle partner network i am not if i was i would get a discount now it's going to ask me to make a username i'm going to go ahead and try to make one great and now i need to make a password so i'm just going to go make a password and then it's going to just ask me a security question great and we'll go next and now what we can do is we can view the exams that we want to book and so here we have a list of exams so we're looking for the foundation's exam so we could just type in foundations up here and then we have the the course codes here so we want to make sure that it's the correct one you can see that there's 20 and 20 f so i'm just going to double check what the code is so our code doesn't have the f i don't know why there's one with f maybe it's like for french i didn't mean to click it it's just loading now so what we'll do is we'll click the one that doesn't have the f then it's going to ask us where do we want to take the test we can say in our home office and then we can run a precheck you definitely want to do a precheck if you can so what this is going to do it's just going to check our systems we're going to see if we can pass right now my webcam isn't working it's showing something here and so this is just to check is my audio working do i have good internet and does my webcam work i'm just going to go hit next and so i've passed the checks so i can close this and then go next and the next thing we can do is we can agree to the online policy so we have to go and click through all of them here hit next and then it's going to show us the price of the exam and also what exam we're taking and the operating systems and other settings that matter we'll hit next and then here we have this option consecutive appointments you may add one or more exams to take on the same day and so i'm just going to hit next and so now we would choose a time so i could say you know on the on the monday here so we could say let's do it on monday and then we would need to choose the time the only time available is 9 pm so i could also choose maybe wednesday where i have more available times so here we could say 2 15. and then from here we're going to see our options it's going to show some of my personal information here and then all we have to do from here is proceed to checkout we're going to be presented with the policies prison with policies and then from here you just go hit accept and you would pay with your credit card and that's all there is to it so the reason i don't want to go through the whole whole end here is because i actually i'm not looking to book the exam today but this is the whole process to book with pearson vue and so good luck on your exam
