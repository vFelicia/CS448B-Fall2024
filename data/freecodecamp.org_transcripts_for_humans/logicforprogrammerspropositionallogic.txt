00:00 - welcome to free code camp I'm commander
00:03 - candy of coding commanders and today I'm
00:06 - gonna teach you all about logic logic is
00:09 - the foundation for all computer
00:11 - programming so the better you're able to
00:14 - understand logic the better and faster
00:17 - you're gonna be able to pick up and
00:18 - learn any programming language or
00:21 - encounter any programming endeavour
00:23 - introduction to logic for programmers
00:26 - propositional logic you'll find
00:29 - reference materials and homework at
00:31 - coding commander's comm slash logic dot
00:35 - PHP mathematics science and computer
00:39 - programming all are based on logical
00:42 - reasoning what logic does is it defines
00:45 - a set of rules if we want to be able to
00:48 - sign typically or exactly determine
00:51 - something we need rules define to make
00:55 - sure we're all measuring by the same
00:57 - standards to make sure that if I say
00:59 - this is a cup cup means the same thing
01:01 - to you that it means to me and at the
01:04 - end of the day we use logic to determine
01:06 - whether things are valid or invalid true
01:09 - or false if you're gonna be doing
01:11 - computer programming especially if you
01:14 - plan on doing business logic building
01:17 - enterprise applications you know working
01:19 - for a company it's a lot of validation a
01:23 - lot of true or false especially on the
01:25 - back end I've worked with like PHP
01:28 - nodejs sequel and a lot of what I do
01:31 - when I'm hired by somebody is validation
01:35 - is this valid or isn't this is it true
01:38 - or is it false if you really think about
01:41 - it at the end of the day just about
01:43 - anything can be boiled down to true or
01:45 - false for example say you're taking a
01:48 - multiple-choice test and the question is
01:51 - four plus four it's multiple choice your
01:55 - options are two four six eight
01:58 - now we're smart mathematicians we know
02:00 - four plus four equals eight right but
02:03 - even though that's open-ended that's not
02:05 - a true/false question we could break the
02:07 - problem down to four two or false
02:10 - questions right
02:12 - four plus four equal to false does four
02:16 - plus four equal four false
02:18 - does four plus four equals six false
02:21 - does four plus four equal eight true and
02:24 - because that's true that's what we're
02:26 - gonna select as our answer today we're
02:29 - gonna cover propositional logic that's
02:31 - the basic building block of logic it's a
02:35 - way for us to determine whether things
02:37 - are valid or invalid you may also hear
02:40 - it referred to as statement logic
02:42 - because you can basically think of a
02:44 - proposition as a statement for example I
02:47 - have blonde and red hair today that
02:50 - statement is true propositional logic
02:53 - allows us to evaluate whether things are
02:56 - true or false
02:57 - based on certain conditions this is
02:59 - sound familiar in computer programming
03:02 - if statements aren't your rectly derived
03:06 - from propositional logic and in this
03:09 - video we're going to learn how remember
03:11 - logic is all about defined rules so
03:14 - first things first let's properly define
03:17 - a proposition a proposition is a
03:21 - statement it has a truth value that
03:26 - means it's either true or false it's not
03:28 - equal to jellybeans it's not equal to
03:31 - 564 it's gonna be true or false and a
03:37 - proposition can only have one single
03:39 - truth value so it can't be true or false
03:42 - it has to be either true or false so
03:49 - let's look at some statements and
03:50 - determine if their propositions are not
03:52 - the first one
03:54 - commander candy is 4 foot 11 is that a
03:58 - statement yes
04:02 - does it evaluate true or false yes and
04:08 - it can only have one single value I'm
04:10 - either 4 foot 11 or I'm not 4 foot 11 so
04:13 - yay commander candy is 4 foot 11 is a
04:16 - proposition by the way this statement is
04:20 - true
04:21 - commander candy is a halfling on 4 foot
04:24 - 11
04:24 - what is your favorite flavor is that a
04:27 - statement yes
04:29 - does it evaluate true or false no this
04:35 - is not a proposition whatever your
04:37 - flavor might be chocolate vanilla
04:39 - strawberry mocha banana mango it's not
04:42 - true or false next X plus y equals 36 is
04:48 - that a statement yes
04:51 - does it evaluate true or false yes
04:54 - either X plus y is 36 or X plus y isn't
04:58 - 36 but it doesn't have a single value
05:03 - depending on the values of x and y it
05:06 - could be true or false so uh this is not
05:10 - a proposition the better you are at
05:13 - logic the better you're going to be at
05:15 - breaking down those complicated problems
05:18 - that we encounter as programmers if you
05:21 - can get it broken down to its basic
05:23 - building blocks is this true or false is
05:25 - this true or false you can solve just
05:28 - about any problem there is we can
05:31 - combine propositions in order to solve
05:34 - more complicated problems in order to do
05:38 - say we're going to use variables such as
05:40 - PQRS X Y Z we're going to use logical
05:45 - operators things like an and/or we're
05:48 - gonna learn some others and we're also
05:52 - going to use comparison operators like
05:54 - less than greater than equal to not
05:56 - equal to less than or equal to we'll go
06:01 - over some of those as well now let's
06:04 - talk notation okay let's look at an
06:07 - example we're gonna start with two
06:09 - statements P and Q let's let P equal
06:17 - Sally is 42 and we're like Q equal Lynda
06:21 - is 36 now let's look at some ways to
06:25 - compare these two statements P and Q we
06:30 - could do P and Q we can do P or Q
06:34 - there's also comparisons like exclusive
06:37 - implication by conditional in order to
06:41 - evaluate if these statements are true or
06:44 - false we're going to use something
06:45 - called a truth table truth tables
06:49 - consist of multiple columns there's
06:51 - going to be a column for each statement
06:53 - or variable and then there's going to be
06:56 - a column for what we're trying to
06:57 - evaluate in a scenario like this where
07:01 - we have two statements or two variables
07:06 - there's gonna be four possibilities if
07:09 - Sally is 42 Linda can either be 36 or
07:14 - not be 36 so if P is true Q can be true
07:18 - or false
07:19 - and if P's false Q can be true or false
07:23 - as well
07:24 - if Sally isn't 42 Linda can still be or
07:28 - not be 36 so let's first look at and
07:31 - Sally is 42 and Linda is 36 that means
07:36 - both those statements are true both P is
07:40 - true and Q is true so there's only one
07:43 - possibility that will make the statement
07:46 - true and that's if piece true and Q's
07:50 - true if there's any false going on there
07:53 - the whole thing's gonna evaluate is
07:56 - false next we have or Sally is 42 or
08:03 - Linda is 36 with or P and cubed they
08:07 - don't both have to be true just one of
08:09 - them has to be true if just one of them
08:12 - is true then the statement P or Q is
08:16 - going to be true with or they don't both
08:19 - have to be true just one has to be true
08:20 - so Sally can be 42 Orland that can be 36
08:26 - P or Q so if there's any truth going on
08:31 - here the statements can evaluate is true
08:33 - if Sally is 42 it's gonna be true if
08:37 - Glen is 36 it's gonna be true but they
08:40 - don't both have to be telling the truth
08:41 - mm-hmm so there's gonna be three
08:44 - possibilities of truth here the only way
08:47 - that P or Q is gonna evaluate false is
08:50 - if both P and Q are false next let's
08:54 - talk about exclusive that means P can be
08:58 - true q can be true but they can't both
09:02 - be true so if Sally is 42 its going to
09:06 - evaluate true if Linda is 36 its gonna
09:10 - evaluate true but its Sally's 42 and
09:13 - Linda's 36 it's not gonna evaluate true
09:17 - if Sally isn't 42 and Linda isn't 36
09:21 - it's not gonna value a true you need
09:24 - exactly one true in one false there's
09:26 - going to be two scenarios to evaluate as
09:28 - true now let's look at implication
09:31 - implication is going to read if P then Q
09:35 - P is what we call the hypothesis and Q
09:40 - is the conclusion this is a conditional
09:43 - statement you know like our if
09:45 - statements and computer programming
09:47 - those are implication so let's look at
09:53 - implication if Sally is 42 then Lynda is
09:58 - 36
09:59 - if Sally is telling the truth and
10:01 - lenders telling the truth then the
10:03 - statements true if Sally is telling the
10:06 - truth and Linda's aligned then the
10:09 - statement is false
10:10 - if Sally is lying then it doesn't really
10:14 - matter if slin de telling the truth or
10:18 - lying it could still be true because it
10:22 - has nothing to do with Linda at that
10:26 - point there's only a condition applied
10:28 - here if Sally is 42 if Sally lied and
10:33 - you know it doesn't really matter
10:36 - anymore anyway now let's look at by
10:40 - conditional that reads P if and only if
10:44 - cubed another way to write that is the F
10:48 - with 2's and this statement is gonna
10:52 - have the same truth value as P implies Q
10:56 - and 2 implies P saying it goes in both
11:01 - directions
11:02 - so basically if Sally is telling the
11:07 - truth and Linda's telling the truth this
11:09 - is going to evaluate true if they're
11:11 - both lying it's still going to value a
11:13 - true but if one's telling the truth and
11:17 - one's lying no matter which direction
11:19 - it's going in it's filled and evaluate
11:21 - false and now let's just touch on
11:23 - negation negation you might see ever in
11:27 - any of these ways like negative 6 that's
11:30 - negating sex it's the opposite not it
11:33 - means like not pee that's how you would
11:36 - read that or the opposite of pee so
11:39 - basically if P is true not pees gonna be
11:44 - false if P is false not P is gonna be
11:48 - true now we're gonna look at some of our
11:50 - comparison operators less than greater
11:54 - than less than or equal to greater than
11:56 - or equal to not equal to these are some
12:00 - comparisons there's also like identical
12:03 - if you're familiar in computer
12:05 - programming like you have like three
12:06 - equal signs
12:08 - these are comparison operators these are
12:11 - ways that we can compare numbers and we
12:14 - use these often in our conditional
12:17 - statements okay let's go ahead and take
12:20 - it back we're gonna bring it back to
12:22 - computer programming I'm gonna show you
12:25 - some examples of conditional statements
12:28 - in a couple programming language and how
12:31 - this relates and trust me as the
12:35 - computer code your writing gets more
12:38 - complicated a good firm solid
12:41 - understanding of these logic
12:43 - fundamentals are really gonna play a big
12:46 - part on your ability to be calm on your
12:49 - competency my next video I'm gonna do
12:53 - set theory that's another very important
12:56 - concept it's like the next step in logic
12:59 - if you understand propositional logic
13:01 - and step theory like really really well
13:04 - you are going to excel at learning
13:07 - whatever programming language or
13:10 - techniques you're trying to learn let's
13:12 - look at an example you're
13:14 - friend invites you to dinner you are
13:16 - only interested in going if dinner is at
13:19 - a Greek restaurant right your response
13:22 - using implication
13:24 - now remember implication it P then Q if
13:28 - not P then na q okay let's break down
13:33 - this example okay - your friend invites
13:35 - you to dinner that's not really
13:37 - important you are only interesting going
13:40 - you're gonna go if dinner is at a Greek
13:44 - restaurant right you're not gonna go if
13:47 - it's not at a Greek restaurant if dinner
13:51 - is Greek you are gonna go if dinner is
13:56 - not Greek you're not gonna go the
14:01 - hypothesis is dinner is Greek that's the
14:04 - P and the conclusion is I will come to
14:08 - dinner you're writing your response so
14:12 - if dinner is Greek your response is
14:15 - gonna be I will come to dinner let P
14:22 - equal Greek like Q equal I will come let
14:27 - R equal I will not come if P then Q and
14:32 - if not P then R and here I use this
14:37 - example from my website because it
14:40 - already has the rules for a conditional
14:43 - statement clearly written out so I'm
14:47 - going to explain now how we're gonna
14:49 - transfer that into computer code okay so
14:52 - this examples in PHP I'm also going to
14:55 - show you with JavaScript afterwards the
14:58 - way the syntax works in PHP per if
15:00 - statements you write if inside the frame
15:04 - to see in your condition and then inside
15:06 - the brackets the clever code you want to
15:09 - execute if the condition is true if it's
15:12 - a save constructed on JavaScript it's
15:14 - pretty common here this is where things
15:17 - get a little bit different than
15:18 - JavaScript but I'm gonna show you how
15:20 - it's easy once you know the base logic
15:24 - to write it in whatever language
15:27 - if dollar sign dinner equals equals or
15:30 - you could put three equals their Greek
15:33 - echo in PHP echo print something yes I
15:38 - will go to dinner okay so now we are
15:41 - going to write this in PHP we're gonna
15:44 - let people Greek q equal I will come to
15:47 - dinner and are equal I will not come to
15:50 - dinner so P then Q and if not P then R
15:57 - so how would we write this in PHP dollar
16:01 - sign P equals Greek and PHP this is how
16:05 - you declare a variable you put a dollar
16:07 - sign in front of it and then you know
16:10 - it's a variable so dollar side P equals
16:13 - Greek I put Greek in quotes because the
16:17 - PHP a string that's like word sends as
16:20 - characters we put them in quotes double
16:22 - or single then I have dollar sign Q
16:26 - equals I will come or ending each line
16:29 - with a semicolon because that's how you
16:31 - do it dollar sign R equals I will not
16:35 - come so basically the condition is your
16:38 - P and then inside is your Q if dinner
16:45 - equal Greek echo I will come else what
16:53 - else means is it's the opposite of
16:55 - whatever condition is in here
16:57 - so if in here I wrote x equals three if
17:02 - x equals three this would execute and if
17:05 - X didn't equal three
17:07 - this would execute so else echo I will
17:12 - not come see how this could be simply
17:16 - translated into whatever programming
17:18 - languages you're at you know you would
17:19 - have to Google how do I declare a
17:21 - variable what the syntax looks like but
17:24 - once you get to construct the condition
17:27 - is the P and the code is the Q now let's
17:32 - take a look at it in JavaScript and
17:34 - JavaScript instead of putting a dollar
17:36 - sign we just name them whatever we want
17:39 - and then
17:40 - we put bar in front of it so and other
17:44 - than that it's pretty much the same is
17:45 - with the PHP and JavaScript we can print
17:50 - to the terminal using console.log so
17:53 - instead of echo I use console.log here
17:56 - but those are the basic differences as
17:59 - you can see in the syntax bar it's in a
18:01 - dollar sign console.log instead of echo
18:04 - other than that we're transferring it
18:06 - the same way we put our P in here and we
18:10 - put our Q in there don't forget I do
18:14 - have homework in the form of a quiz game
18:16 - and some reference materials available
18:19 - at coding commander's comm slash logic
18:23 - dot PHP on a page you'll see links to
18:27 - everything I have related to here to
18:30 - help you out now let's do some practice
18:33 - problems together now I'm just going to
18:35 - do some simple little math problems with
18:38 - you using logic so you get a better
18:41 - grasp on how to apply the logic to
18:44 - real-life problems I definitely suggest
18:47 - afterwards checking out the quiz I have
18:50 - to reinforce the logic that you've
18:53 - learned and also get better at it
18:55 - quicker at it sharper at it good idea
18:57 - would be to these examples that I'm
19:00 - doing go ahead and write it out in
19:03 - whatever programming language you might
19:05 - be working on if you've started learning
19:07 - one or if you know you want to learn one
19:09 - I did also like materials odd writing
19:13 - logic in PHP so if you're not already
19:15 - working on a programming language go
19:19 - ahead and write out my examples in PHP
19:21 - if you can't think of how you can always
19:23 - console.log print equals I have this
19:27 - like blown up a little bit it looks a
19:28 - little pixelize that's cool right pixels
19:31 - are cool right so let's do x equals two
19:35 - and we're gonna go ahead and do y equals
19:40 - zero so let's say that x equals two is
19:45 - our P and y equals zero is arc
19:52 - P and Q would read that x equals two and
19:59 - y equals zero so let's say if X plus y
20:08 - equals four what are the truth
20:12 - possibilities here okay so let's see
20:16 - what are the different possibilities of
20:18 - truth here
20:20 - first of all okay if x equals two and y
20:24 - equals zero 2 Plus 0 is 2 not 4 so
20:28 - something's fishy here right would it be
20:32 - possible for X and Y to both be true
20:38 - would that be possible
20:40 - no this one would be false would it be
20:45 - possible for X or Y to be true yes this
20:54 - is possible we don't have enough
20:57 - information really to know anything you
21:02 - know we know that one of them's lying at
21:03 - least right haha one of them could be
21:06 - like or both of them could be lie so
21:09 - here this could be true or false we're
21:13 - gonna need some more information here to
21:15 - make a definite decision but if I were
21:18 - to give this to you as a given this can
21:21 - still be true now let's do X or could be
21:25 - true or false as well right
21:27 - okay now let's do this I'm gonna give
21:29 - you some information and let's come up
21:33 - with some stuff that's true and some
21:34 - stuff that's false given X is less than
21:38 - Y a parenthesis and x equals 3 so we're
21:47 - gonna take this as bat now let's see I'm
21:51 - gonna give you some values and you tell
21:53 - me if it's true or false y equals 3 y
22:02 - equals 0
22:05 - why equals 3 times X okay now you tell
22:12 - me what's true and what's false okay
22:15 - first of all with the given it's an an
22:18 - so that means both have to be satisfied
22:20 - X has to be less than Y and X also has
22:25 - to equal 3 so which of these statements
22:28 - could Polly be true given the
22:31 - information okay if X is less than Y and
22:35 - X is equal to 3 can Y also be equal to 3
22:39 - no if it was less than or equal to that
22:43 - could be true but it's not so this is
22:45 - false sure that we know that's
22:49 - definitely not the case y equals 0 if X
22:53 - equals 3 and Y is less than X could Y be
22:58 - 0 no because well 0 is less than 3 and Y
23:06 - is got to be bigger than 3 false
23:09 - y equals 3 X could Y be equal to the
23:15 - value of x times 3 which is 9 yes
23:18 - because 9 is bigger than 3 okay given
23:21 - I'm gonna give you some information in
23:23 - this information I'm giving you we're
23:25 - gonna just assume is true x equals
23:29 - negative 3 y equals 3 and Z equals 0 now
23:39 - I'm gonna give you some statements and
23:42 - then you tell me if they are true or not
23:45 - let's do negative y is less than 0 X is
23:54 - equal to Y and X plus y equals Z all
24:04 - right negative Y is less than 0 okay Y
24:09 - is 3 y is 3 so negative Y would be
24:14 - negative
24:15 - the ring and negative three is
24:17 - definitely this is so true yeah you
24:21 - always felt you're wrong okay I'm gonna
24:25 - give it a star now let's do X equals y
24:28 - if X is negative three and Y is three
24:31 - those are not equal so this is ball X
24:36 - plus y equals Z does negative three plus
24:39 - three equals zero yes it does this is so
24:42 - true yay thank you for watching my video
24:48 - if you have any questions at all please
24:50 - don't hesitate to comment below so I can
24:52 - help you out I will be going through the
24:55 - comments on this video also feel free to
24:58 - reach out to me on any of my social
25:00 - media at coning commander on twitter
25:03 - everywhere else some coding commanders
25:05 - you can just google me see where I'm at
25:07 - thank you again for watching and until
25:09 - next time happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to free code camp I'm commander candy of coding commanders and today I'm gonna teach you all about logic logic is the foundation for all computer programming so the better you're able to understand logic the better and faster you're gonna be able to pick up and learn any programming language or encounter any programming endeavour introduction to logic for programmers propositional logic you'll find reference materials and homework at coding commander's comm slash logic dot PHP mathematics science and computer programming all are based on logical reasoning what logic does is it defines a set of rules if we want to be able to sign typically or exactly determine something we need rules define to make sure we're all measuring by the same standards to make sure that if I say this is a cup cup means the same thing to you that it means to me and at the end of the day we use logic to determine whether things are valid or invalid true or false if you're gonna be doing computer programming especially if you plan on doing business logic building enterprise applications you know working for a company it's a lot of validation a lot of true or false especially on the back end I've worked with like PHP nodejs sequel and a lot of what I do when I'm hired by somebody is validation is this valid or isn't this is it true or is it false if you really think about it at the end of the day just about anything can be boiled down to true or false for example say you're taking a multiplechoice test and the question is four plus four it's multiple choice your options are two four six eight now we're smart mathematicians we know four plus four equals eight right but even though that's openended that's not a true/false question we could break the problem down to four two or false questions right four plus four equal to false does four plus four equal four false does four plus four equals six false does four plus four equal eight true and because that's true that's what we're gonna select as our answer today we're gonna cover propositional logic that's the basic building block of logic it's a way for us to determine whether things are valid or invalid you may also hear it referred to as statement logic because you can basically think of a proposition as a statement for example I have blonde and red hair today that statement is true propositional logic allows us to evaluate whether things are true or false based on certain conditions this is sound familiar in computer programming if statements aren't your rectly derived from propositional logic and in this video we're going to learn how remember logic is all about defined rules so first things first let's properly define a proposition a proposition is a statement it has a truth value that means it's either true or false it's not equal to jellybeans it's not equal to 564 it's gonna be true or false and a proposition can only have one single truth value so it can't be true or false it has to be either true or false so let's look at some statements and determine if their propositions are not the first one commander candy is 4 foot 11 is that a statement yes does it evaluate true or false yes and it can only have one single value I'm either 4 foot 11 or I'm not 4 foot 11 so yay commander candy is 4 foot 11 is a proposition by the way this statement is true commander candy is a halfling on 4 foot 11 what is your favorite flavor is that a statement yes does it evaluate true or false no this is not a proposition whatever your flavor might be chocolate vanilla strawberry mocha banana mango it's not true or false next X plus y equals 36 is that a statement yes does it evaluate true or false yes either X plus y is 36 or X plus y isn't 36 but it doesn't have a single value depending on the values of x and y it could be true or false so uh this is not a proposition the better you are at logic the better you're going to be at breaking down those complicated problems that we encounter as programmers if you can get it broken down to its basic building blocks is this true or false is this true or false you can solve just about any problem there is we can combine propositions in order to solve more complicated problems in order to do say we're going to use variables such as PQRS X Y Z we're going to use logical operators things like an and/or we're gonna learn some others and we're also going to use comparison operators like less than greater than equal to not equal to less than or equal to we'll go over some of those as well now let's talk notation okay let's look at an example we're gonna start with two statements P and Q let's let P equal Sally is 42 and we're like Q equal Lynda is 36 now let's look at some ways to compare these two statements P and Q we could do P and Q we can do P or Q there's also comparisons like exclusive implication by conditional in order to evaluate if these statements are true or false we're going to use something called a truth table truth tables consist of multiple columns there's going to be a column for each statement or variable and then there's going to be a column for what we're trying to evaluate in a scenario like this where we have two statements or two variables there's gonna be four possibilities if Sally is 42 Linda can either be 36 or not be 36 so if P is true Q can be true or false and if P's false Q can be true or false as well if Sally isn't 42 Linda can still be or not be 36 so let's first look at and Sally is 42 and Linda is 36 that means both those statements are true both P is true and Q is true so there's only one possibility that will make the statement true and that's if piece true and Q's true if there's any false going on there the whole thing's gonna evaluate is false next we have or Sally is 42 or Linda is 36 with or P and cubed they don't both have to be true just one of them has to be true if just one of them is true then the statement P or Q is going to be true with or they don't both have to be true just one has to be true so Sally can be 42 Orland that can be 36 P or Q so if there's any truth going on here the statements can evaluate is true if Sally is 42 it's gonna be true if Glen is 36 it's gonna be true but they don't both have to be telling the truth mmhmm so there's gonna be three possibilities of truth here the only way that P or Q is gonna evaluate false is if both P and Q are false next let's talk about exclusive that means P can be true q can be true but they can't both be true so if Sally is 42 its going to evaluate true if Linda is 36 its gonna evaluate true but its Sally's 42 and Linda's 36 it's not gonna evaluate true if Sally isn't 42 and Linda isn't 36 it's not gonna value a true you need exactly one true in one false there's going to be two scenarios to evaluate as true now let's look at implication implication is going to read if P then Q P is what we call the hypothesis and Q is the conclusion this is a conditional statement you know like our if statements and computer programming those are implication so let's look at implication if Sally is 42 then Lynda is 36 if Sally is telling the truth and lenders telling the truth then the statements true if Sally is telling the truth and Linda's aligned then the statement is false if Sally is lying then it doesn't really matter if slin de telling the truth or lying it could still be true because it has nothing to do with Linda at that point there's only a condition applied here if Sally is 42 if Sally lied and you know it doesn't really matter anymore anyway now let's look at by conditional that reads P if and only if cubed another way to write that is the F with 2's and this statement is gonna have the same truth value as P implies Q and 2 implies P saying it goes in both directions so basically if Sally is telling the truth and Linda's telling the truth this is going to evaluate true if they're both lying it's still going to value a true but if one's telling the truth and one's lying no matter which direction it's going in it's filled and evaluate false and now let's just touch on negation negation you might see ever in any of these ways like negative 6 that's negating sex it's the opposite not it means like not pee that's how you would read that or the opposite of pee so basically if P is true not pees gonna be false if P is false not P is gonna be true now we're gonna look at some of our comparison operators less than greater than less than or equal to greater than or equal to not equal to these are some comparisons there's also like identical if you're familiar in computer programming like you have like three equal signs these are comparison operators these are ways that we can compare numbers and we use these often in our conditional statements okay let's go ahead and take it back we're gonna bring it back to computer programming I'm gonna show you some examples of conditional statements in a couple programming language and how this relates and trust me as the computer code your writing gets more complicated a good firm solid understanding of these logic fundamentals are really gonna play a big part on your ability to be calm on your competency my next video I'm gonna do set theory that's another very important concept it's like the next step in logic if you understand propositional logic and step theory like really really well you are going to excel at learning whatever programming language or techniques you're trying to learn let's look at an example you're friend invites you to dinner you are only interested in going if dinner is at a Greek restaurant right your response using implication now remember implication it P then Q if not P then na q okay let's break down this example okay your friend invites you to dinner that's not really important you are only interesting going you're gonna go if dinner is at a Greek restaurant right you're not gonna go if it's not at a Greek restaurant if dinner is Greek you are gonna go if dinner is not Greek you're not gonna go the hypothesis is dinner is Greek that's the P and the conclusion is I will come to dinner you're writing your response so if dinner is Greek your response is gonna be I will come to dinner let P equal Greek like Q equal I will come let R equal I will not come if P then Q and if not P then R and here I use this example from my website because it already has the rules for a conditional statement clearly written out so I'm going to explain now how we're gonna transfer that into computer code okay so this examples in PHP I'm also going to show you with JavaScript afterwards the way the syntax works in PHP per if statements you write if inside the frame to see in your condition and then inside the brackets the clever code you want to execute if the condition is true if it's a save constructed on JavaScript it's pretty common here this is where things get a little bit different than JavaScript but I'm gonna show you how it's easy once you know the base logic to write it in whatever language if dollar sign dinner equals equals or you could put three equals their Greek echo in PHP echo print something yes I will go to dinner okay so now we are going to write this in PHP we're gonna let people Greek q equal I will come to dinner and are equal I will not come to dinner so P then Q and if not P then R so how would we write this in PHP dollar sign P equals Greek and PHP this is how you declare a variable you put a dollar sign in front of it and then you know it's a variable so dollar side P equals Greek I put Greek in quotes because the PHP a string that's like word sends as characters we put them in quotes double or single then I have dollar sign Q equals I will come or ending each line with a semicolon because that's how you do it dollar sign R equals I will not come so basically the condition is your P and then inside is your Q if dinner equal Greek echo I will come else what else means is it's the opposite of whatever condition is in here so if in here I wrote x equals three if x equals three this would execute and if X didn't equal three this would execute so else echo I will not come see how this could be simply translated into whatever programming languages you're at you know you would have to Google how do I declare a variable what the syntax looks like but once you get to construct the condition is the P and the code is the Q now let's take a look at it in JavaScript and JavaScript instead of putting a dollar sign we just name them whatever we want and then we put bar in front of it so and other than that it's pretty much the same is with the PHP and JavaScript we can print to the terminal using console.log so instead of echo I use console.log here but those are the basic differences as you can see in the syntax bar it's in a dollar sign console.log instead of echo other than that we're transferring it the same way we put our P in here and we put our Q in there don't forget I do have homework in the form of a quiz game and some reference materials available at coding commander's comm slash logic dot PHP on a page you'll see links to everything I have related to here to help you out now let's do some practice problems together now I'm just going to do some simple little math problems with you using logic so you get a better grasp on how to apply the logic to reallife problems I definitely suggest afterwards checking out the quiz I have to reinforce the logic that you've learned and also get better at it quicker at it sharper at it good idea would be to these examples that I'm doing go ahead and write it out in whatever programming language you might be working on if you've started learning one or if you know you want to learn one I did also like materials odd writing logic in PHP so if you're not already working on a programming language go ahead and write out my examples in PHP if you can't think of how you can always console.log print equals I have this like blown up a little bit it looks a little pixelize that's cool right pixels are cool right so let's do x equals two and we're gonna go ahead and do y equals zero so let's say that x equals two is our P and y equals zero is arc P and Q would read that x equals two and y equals zero so let's say if X plus y equals four what are the truth possibilities here okay so let's see what are the different possibilities of truth here first of all okay if x equals two and y equals zero 2 Plus 0 is 2 not 4 so something's fishy here right would it be possible for X and Y to both be true would that be possible no this one would be false would it be possible for X or Y to be true yes this is possible we don't have enough information really to know anything you know we know that one of them's lying at least right haha one of them could be like or both of them could be lie so here this could be true or false we're gonna need some more information here to make a definite decision but if I were to give this to you as a given this can still be true now let's do X or could be true or false as well right okay now let's do this I'm gonna give you some information and let's come up with some stuff that's true and some stuff that's false given X is less than Y a parenthesis and x equals 3 so we're gonna take this as bat now let's see I'm gonna give you some values and you tell me if it's true or false y equals 3 y equals 0 why equals 3 times X okay now you tell me what's true and what's false okay first of all with the given it's an an so that means both have to be satisfied X has to be less than Y and X also has to equal 3 so which of these statements could Polly be true given the information okay if X is less than Y and X is equal to 3 can Y also be equal to 3 no if it was less than or equal to that could be true but it's not so this is false sure that we know that's definitely not the case y equals 0 if X equals 3 and Y is less than X could Y be 0 no because well 0 is less than 3 and Y is got to be bigger than 3 false y equals 3 X could Y be equal to the value of x times 3 which is 9 yes because 9 is bigger than 3 okay given I'm gonna give you some information in this information I'm giving you we're gonna just assume is true x equals negative 3 y equals 3 and Z equals 0 now I'm gonna give you some statements and then you tell me if they are true or not let's do negative y is less than 0 X is equal to Y and X plus y equals Z all right negative Y is less than 0 okay Y is 3 y is 3 so negative Y would be negative the ring and negative three is definitely this is so true yeah you always felt you're wrong okay I'm gonna give it a star now let's do X equals y if X is negative three and Y is three those are not equal so this is ball X plus y equals Z does negative three plus three equals zero yes it does this is so true yay thank you for watching my video if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to comment below so I can help you out I will be going through the comments on this video also feel free to reach out to me on any of my social media at coning commander on twitter everywhere else some coding commanders you can just google me see where I'm at thank you again for watching and until next time happy coding
