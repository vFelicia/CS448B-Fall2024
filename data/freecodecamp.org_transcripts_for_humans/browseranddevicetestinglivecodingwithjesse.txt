With timestamps:

00:07 - hey everybody its Jesse and today I'm
00:12 - sick so I apologize if I'm a little bit
00:17 - harder to hear today or a little out of
00:18 - it but I don't have time to be sick
00:21 - because we got to launch this site so
00:24 - the site's going to launch tomorrow we
00:27 - need to do some testing I'm going to
00:31 - test using browser stack and also with
00:36 - the device so I have the pixel XL and
00:41 - I'm just I have it connected directly to
00:45 - my iMac and we're going to use dev tools
00:48 - and test on the device I did want to
00:52 - show you how to test simulate an iPhone
00:56 - with Xcode but I tried to start it two
01:00 - minutes ago and it wanted me to download
01:01 - extra stuff for it to work that's not
01:04 - going to happen so sorry about that
01:06 - ideally for it it's better if you
01:10 - actually have a fun and iPhone to test
01:12 - it on if you can get a hold of one I
01:14 - found the simulator isn't always
01:16 - accurate you get the Xcode simulator so
01:21 - some other people that I work with have
01:24 - fun so I'm just going to borrow one of
01:25 - their funds later on and test because
01:28 - based on the analytics for some of our
01:30 - other sites a lot of users are going to
01:35 - be on an iPhone so the browsers that we
01:39 - need to worry about most based on the
01:41 - analytics are chrome which we should be
01:45 - fine in chrome we've been developing it
01:47 - in from the whole way so I'm not as
01:49 - worried about that and Safari
01:53 - specifically Mobile Safari which I
01:56 - always have problems with on my list of
01:59 - least favorite browsers Mobile Safari
02:01 - might be worse than edited Explorer for
02:03 - me so I mean at least worse than
02:08 - Internet Explorer 11 we will try out
02:11 - internet explorer 11
02:13 - I don't think I'm going to bother with
02:15 - edge because our analytics show it's
02:19 - such a small percentage of our users are
02:21 - using edge it's probably not a good use
02:25 - of our time at this point if I had more
02:28 - time I'd maybe give it a try so let's
02:35 - get started with some testing oh hey
02:37 - everybody I just looked at the live chat
02:39 - some people saying hello I've a question
02:44 - for it for all of you if I'm having an
02:50 - issue with one of my other site so I'm
02:52 - going to throw this out there and y'all
02:53 - can think about it and comment or direct
02:55 - message me or something if you have a
02:57 - good answer I'm using I have an app
03:01 - where users have to log in I'm using
03:04 - auth0 for authentication it's one of the
03:08 - magic link logins so they get an email
03:10 - with a link when they click the link
03:12 - they're logged in and it saves
03:14 - everything in the browser's local
03:16 - storage and they're supposed to stay
03:17 - logged in unless they actually log
03:19 - themselves out with the log out button
03:22 - so I'm having two problems one users
03:25 - keep getting logged out and they're
03:27 - saying that they haven't tried to log
03:29 - out they can't remember what they can't
03:34 - remember ever like running some type of
03:38 - program that would have logged them out
03:40 - like cleared out all their local storage
03:41 - so basically they're getting logged out
03:44 - for no apparent reason and I haven't
03:47 - been able to recreate the issue
03:49 - I've tried probably dozens of times have
03:52 - gone to the you know different computers
03:55 - that the actual computers where it's
03:57 - happening for the users and I can't get
03:59 - it to happen again and then the other
04:01 - issue is when they try to log back in
04:04 - and have that that magic link sent to
04:06 - them again they're not seeing the emails
04:09 - I'm using SendGrid for emails and the
04:12 - SendGrid analytics it says that the
04:14 - emails are actually delivered but
04:17 - they're not they're not showing up in
04:19 - their inbox or in the junk mail folders
04:22 - for these people so just just one of
04:26 - anyone
04:27 - using either SendGrid or r0 or both of
04:30 - them together if you've had any issues
04:33 - like that especially issues with local
04:36 - storage being cleared out randomly from
04:39 - the browser or with emails some some
04:43 - people just not getting emails on the
04:45 - same system I'm on the same email system
04:47 - and I tested it earlier I got the email
04:50 - within a minute
04:52 - so I don't the issues so sorry for the
04:56 - little sidebar there let's get back to
05:00 - the testing so basically the first thing
05:06 - I want to do is show you how to set up
05:10 - the a mobile device for testing so
05:13 - there's not a lot you have to do
05:15 - actually on the phone so I'm not going
05:16 - to show you the phone part of it but you
05:20 - can look it up it's usually it's pretty
05:23 - easy you'd have to go into your settings
05:26 - under your advanced settings and there's
05:28 - like a developer mode I think you have
05:31 - to click on the version number in
05:36 - settings like seven times
05:38 - it's really weird I'm this is for
05:40 - Android by the way so I you can hook up
05:43 - an iPhone and do debugging as well but
05:48 - it's a different since I don't have an
05:49 - iPhone right now I'm not going to go
05:52 - over that maybe we'll do it in a
05:54 - different video so basically you have to
05:59 - enable developer options and you do that
06:04 - by I can't remember exactly what you
06:06 - clicked I've already done it but I think
06:08 - it's like the Android version number
06:11 - when you go into settings and about and
06:13 - you have to click it I think seven times
06:15 - and then will ask you do want to enable
06:17 - developer options yes and then you have
06:20 - this extra thing in your menu this extra
06:23 - item so you can go into there and enable
06:27 - USB debugging so that's what you want
06:30 - you want to be able to enable USB
06:31 - debugging so if you haven't Android you
06:33 - want to do this Google enable USB
06:35 - debugging on and
06:37 - and it will let you know exactly what
06:39 - the steps are since I camera I'm almost
06:42 - positive that the way I described it is
06:44 - how it went but it's been so long since
06:46 - I've done it I can't be sure so you
06:49 - probably want to double-check I don't
06:51 - have a link right now so sorry if I if I
06:55 - have time and I remember which I
06:56 - probably want I'll throw the link in the
06:59 - description normally I would throw the
07:01 - link in but I'm just really pressed for
07:03 - time to get this site launched so now
07:07 - I'm going to show you how to link up
07:11 - your device so if you open up dev tools
07:14 - okay which you can just click on inspect
07:18 - anywhere and that will open up dev tools
07:20 - for you
07:22 - let me how's the font on dev tools do I
07:25 - need to make it bigger let me know
07:30 - alright somebody in a live chat said
07:32 - it's not the Android version number it's
07:34 - the compilation number or something like
07:35 - that I think you're right I can't
07:37 - remember it was some some number in
07:40 - there I know that's not great
07:42 - information but I'm you'll be able to
07:46 - find it the information is really easy
07:48 - to find if you want like a step by step
07:50 - if you go to Udacity they actually show
07:54 - you this in in one of their courses they
07:56 - have like a link to a video it's their
08:00 - course on my like mobile is a responsive
08:08 - images something like that sorry that's
08:11 - not good advice I think so let me make
08:19 - this bigger and move this up here so you
08:25 - can see what's going on okay so we have
08:30 - some of the live chat saying we do need
08:32 - it bigger okay that's probably as big as
08:35 - I can make it without blocking out stuff
08:37 - that we need to see so all I've done is
08:41 - I've connected my my phone to the
08:45 - computer so I have for this phone it's
08:48 - one of the USBC
08:50 - so I have a connector that's just a
08:53 - regular USB on one end and then a new
08:55 - USBC on the other end going into my
08:56 - phone so that's plugged in I've enabled
08:59 - USB debugging on my phone now I just
09:03 - open dev tools and I go I click on this
09:06 - it probably will be clicked on by
09:09 - default discover USB devices when I do
09:12 - that then it brings up this pixel so I
09:16 - can see it over here and I'll actually
09:17 - if you click it it will show you open
09:21 - windows that you have I've done one
09:23 - other steps since we're developing this
09:25 - locally if you're not testing a site
09:28 - locally if you're testing a site that's
09:29 - available you know online from a normal
09:31 - URL you can skip this step but since we
09:35 - have a local server running we want to
09:37 - match up the ports so I just used
09:41 - localhost 8080 this first number is for
09:46 - my phone the second one is what port
09:50 - we're running it on so I'm actually
09:51 - running this local server on port 3000
09:55 - so I just I added a rule when I entered
09:59 - these two numbers in now when I go on my
10:03 - phone to localhost 8080 I can actually
10:07 - see the development side I know you guys
10:09 - can't see it I was trying to I have a
10:14 - program there let me share my phone
10:16 - screen but for some reason it wasn't
10:17 - working I kind of think that because I'm
10:20 - using the ports it's like one of the
10:22 - ports that that was also using and so I
10:25 - messed it up but I didn't really have
10:28 - time to troubleshoot so now that you're
10:33 - linked up you can go I can go into my
10:38 - pixel and see I have been saying the
10:43 - port forwarding is working and I want to
10:46 - inspect let's enter URL so you can I can
10:51 - enter this localhost 8080 and click open
11:03 - and this should work okay I guess not
11:10 - there we go it just took a second but
11:13 - see it on my phone it just opened it and
11:16 - now I can see that tab here that
11:18 - localhost:8080 and now I can it inspect
11:21 - okay and now my inspector it's taking a
11:29 - second to load but now this section once
11:33 - it loads this section will actually
11:36 - correspond to what's on my phone so the
11:38 - cool thing is now if I go over and
11:41 - change some Styles here it'll show up on
11:45 - my phone in real time so I can test it
11:49 - out it's a little bit nicer than just
11:52 - kind of shrinking your window because
11:55 - you get to you'll really see like how if
11:58 - you have let's say some type of scroll
12:00 - tracking or click function or something
12:02 - you can see how it is with the touch I
12:05 - know you can simulate some of this with
12:09 - dev tools but if you have a device you
12:14 - don't have to have every device if you
12:15 - just get one device and try things out
12:18 - on it it's really worthwhile so in
12:24 - general I just you know click around and
12:27 - see see what's working what's not
12:32 - working so there's definitely some delay
12:38 - so just a heads-up on that every time I
12:42 - go to click on a link it doesn't refresh
12:45 - right away there's this a delay so
12:55 - alright so I'm not going to spend a lot
12:57 - of time on that I just wanted to show
12:59 - you how to set that up because I didn't
13:02 - get the screen sharing working so it'd
13:04 - be really boring for you all to have me
13:06 - describe to you what I'm saying on my
13:08 - mobile the next way I'm going to test is
13:13 - with browser stacks
13:15 - I have this somewhere where did I put it
13:18 - okay here it is okay so we have thanks
13:30 - for the ports it sorry I'm just checking
13:32 - the live chat for a second make sure
13:37 - okay it looks like there's we don't have
13:39 - any questions or anything everybody's
13:41 - still following alright so I'm going to
13:43 - go in here in a browser stack now I can
13:48 - I normally just use Xcode since I'm on a
13:52 - Mac and I test directly on my Mac
13:54 - instead of going in to a browser stack
13:57 - but since I have have to install updates
14:01 - before that'll work let's go in we'll
14:05 - just try this iPhone 6's I don't have a
14:09 - lot of like really good analytics data
14:11 - on the actual type of iPhone devices
14:18 - exercise I don't know my screen is maybe
14:22 - 27 I sorry I just lost my train of
14:30 - thought if you're just joining in you
14:32 - missed at the beginning I apologize in
14:34 - advance I'm really not feeling well so
14:37 - the the streams going to be a little bit
14:39 - a little bit off I'm just not going to
14:43 - be as as on top of things as I normally
14:45 - would be so you have to wait this is
14:53 - browser stack is it's pretty good hey
14:56 - this is it actually saved the last site
14:58 - I looked at on here probably not me this
15:02 - is a somebody we share an account me and
15:07 - another developer so that's probably
15:11 - it's like he was testing so basically I
15:13 - I have a phone here I don't know if I
15:17 - can make this bigger so I'm sorry if
15:18 - this is small it looks small for me so
15:23 - I'll just give you kind of an idea of
15:26 - how to do this
15:29 - now some things on browserstack allow
15:32 - you to do port forwarding last time I
15:35 - use this which is within the last few
15:38 - months you could not do it with the
15:41 - iPhones so I'm not going to try to do it
15:44 - right now
15:45 - you can do it I think with Windows based
15:48 - things windows-based browsers so you
15:54 - might want to check that out that would
15:55 - also be cool so in this case I'm just
15:57 - going to go to our test you are out and
16:07 - it's it's pretty much up to date there's
16:09 - a couple of things I did that I didn't
16:11 - push to the to the server yet but for
16:14 - the most part test code catechins calm
16:18 - let's see okay it's not it's not working
16:25 - let me go back here and see if it's
16:27 - working on on my brother okay wow it is
16:35 - working let me refresh one more son good
16:43 - thing we're testing let's try to go to
16:47 - maybe one of the interior pages see if
16:50 - we have a better look No
16:53 - all right now we can't open dev tools
16:55 - here so let's open dev tools and see
16:56 - what we're getting
16:57 - can't find variable and it's unexpected
17:01 - NFR this card hmm
17:18 - all right let's see where this is that
17:21 - it's possible it's not showing me hmm
17:35 - let's see I want to go and shovel it
17:43 - looks like it's not even loading I want
17:47 - to check to make sure okay it is loading
17:51 - our our app all right dodge it is okay
18:02 - okay it's linked two of them all right
18:08 - so what did it say 121 this this card
18:13 - team card clickhandler okay
18:22 - yeah the lab says somebody asks is
18:23 - browserstack free there is a free trial
18:25 - it doesn't let you do a lot though so
18:28 - yeah this is not a free tool yeah you
18:31 - can use Xcode to simulate an iPhone on
18:34 - your computer for free if you have a Mac
18:37 - so I would normally I like to use that
18:41 - better than trying to simulate iPhones
18:44 - and browserstack and then if you have a
18:47 - device the actual physical device of
18:49 - course you can test with that but I
18:55 - think probably what's happening with the
18:59 - iPhone and I'll need to I'm going to
19:01 - test this with an actual device just so
19:04 - it's a little bit faster for me after I
19:06 - update Xcode probably what's happening
19:09 - and I don't know why this just slipped
19:12 - my mind before is I'm using a lot of
19:15 - things from es6 I don't know what the
19:19 - coverage is on mobile safari for es6
19:24 - it's possible that that's messing some
19:27 - of this this up
19:30 - I don't know we'll see yeah because the
19:35 - first the first time I use something
19:37 - that's es6 is at line 21 and I'm using
19:41 - let instead of their and that's the
19:44 - first error we got so I'm guessing
19:47 - Mobile Safari does not support let so
19:51 - I'll have to use Babel and transpile
19:57 - that into es5 code and then try again on
20:02 - an iPhone but what we can do is try to
20:09 - go I don't think I have a page that
20:12 - isn't using some type of es6 we can
20:20 - transpile real quick and do it I mean we
20:22 - have that might be worthwhile worthwhile
20:26 - to do so if you've never used es6 or
20:29 - babel before let's try it out okay so
20:39 - you need to let's see let me grab all of
20:49 - my app touches so basically this
20:56 - JavaScript that you're writing in your
20:58 - components you're fine with it's going
21:00 - to be automatically transpired but since
21:04 - we imported this a tas file from our
21:07 - previous static site then we just
21:09 - brought it in and have it in the static
21:11 - folder i next doesn't automatically
21:13 - transpile that for you that's something
21:15 - I'd have to set up probably as an NPM
21:19 - script in the package.json file so I
21:22 - have not set that up yet I've set it up
21:25 - in a previous project at some point I'm
21:27 - probably just going to copy that code
21:29 - into there but I haven't done it yet so
21:32 - what we can do now is just kind of
21:34 - manually transpile this just so that we
21:37 - can do some testing so I just copy this
21:41 - in on this side and you can see
21:44 - using let me make this bigger I'll make
21:49 - this whole thing bigger okay so on this
21:53 - side we have some es6 stuffs we have let
21:56 - what else we have I'm probably using
21:59 - cost in some places too I'm using
22:02 - template literal syntax so we go over to
22:05 - this side we can see that let has been
22:09 - changed into two there and I'm not going
22:15 - to look for the template literal syntax
22:16 - but if you basically what it would do is
22:20 - just use regular quotation marks and you
22:24 - know your plus signs mix in with your
22:27 - variables so your file is going to be a
22:29 - little bit bigger after you do this but
22:33 - older browsers will be able to use it so
22:35 - I'm just going to copy this for now and
22:39 - [Music]
22:40 - let's see what the best way to do this I
22:43 - I'm just going to I'm just going to go
22:52 - and paste this all in and overwrite this
22:54 - file for now because we have this this
22:59 - saves the lemming let me just throw this
23:02 - in another file just to say that okay
23:10 - just in case we need to go back
23:13 - okay so let's save and we're going to go
23:20 - over I'm going to put this on the server
23:22 - really quick it should take probably two
23:25 - minutes - I'll let you guys see this I
23:32 - showed everybody yesterday but just in
23:34 - case you don't know how I'm putting
23:36 - things on the server right now this is
23:41 - the tooth let's make this a bit bigger
23:46 - okay so this is my local machine I'm
23:49 - just going to do a git commit
23:56 - so we're just going to transpile we're
24:02 - going to push that to github and then
24:06 - let's go back here I've just used SSH to
24:11 - go into the server on digital ocean and
24:14 - now I'm in to see them it looks
24:17 - different a username Jessie now we're
24:22 - going to go into our folder and we're
24:28 - going to stop stop our our app for just
24:37 - a minute we'll do a get pool and we'll
24:42 - do we'll do a build as soon as this
24:52 - builds over we'll just start up our
24:53 - server again and then we're good to go
24:55 - with our testing we go right back in now
24:57 - we shouldn't get the errors from the ESX
25:00 - stuff so so I didn't think of that
25:03 - beforehand just working on a lot of
25:06 - other stuff today and I did not think
25:09 - about it okay so Patrick and a live chat
25:16 - says can I use as mobile safari should
25:18 - support let since late last year okay
25:22 - well I'm not sure what the problem was
25:25 - then I mean we're definitely getting an
25:27 - error on the the line that I first used
25:30 - let with so I'm not actually I don't
25:34 - remember what version of Safari I was
25:37 - testing with browser stack it's possible
25:39 - that I was testing an older version
25:41 - we'll go back in and see what the
25:44 - version is all right so now our build is
25:49 - ready let me start everything up and we
25:54 - should be good to go so let's go back
25:56 - over here and let's try oops let's try
26:04 - to go back all right
26:06 - and it works so
26:10 - I'm not sure what what the problem was
26:16 - for sure I think it was let and this is
26:19 - probably just an older version of Safari
26:23 - but now at least we can scroll down let
26:27 - me see if I can make this bigger hmm all
26:38 - right since device is already to actual
26:40 - size so I guess it's not okay so this is
26:44 - browsers iOS 9 so this is Safari in an
26:49 - iOS version 9 what's the newest one is
26:54 - it is 10
26:55 - okay so nice you gather you already
26:58 - uncovered in the live chat support for 4
27:02 - let which is an es6 thing starts in
27:05 - version 10.2 ok and somebody mentions
27:16 - something about the auth0 stuff I don't
27:19 - want to interrupt right now so towards
27:21 - the end I'm going to come back to that
27:22 - thanks for for mentioning that I'll just
27:27 - say for now I'm not using an iframe to
27:32 - log out on the log out is basically I
27:35 - just clear local storage when they click
27:38 - the button but people are saying that
27:40 - they're not clicking the button and the
27:42 - local storage is still being cleared
27:43 - when I go to check their their browsers
27:47 - there's nothing in local storage but I
27:50 - can't get it to clear on you know just
27:52 - on its own again I can't recreate the
27:55 - problem ok so I'm going to scroll down a
28:00 - little bit I realize this is super small
28:08 - yeah and I don't I don't know how to to
28:11 - make this bigger except to I can zoom
28:16 - into the site itself let's see if I can
28:18 - zoom in here all right okay so the
28:22 - uh you know just the zoom from the
28:25 - touchpad on an eye and I like the iMac
28:31 - magic touch pad works okay so we got a
28:34 - little bigger here so I'm just going to
28:35 - scroll you don't get like the real
28:38 - feeling of scrolling I'm you know I'm
28:40 - using my touchpad to scroll but we can
28:44 - do some some clicking around okay so
28:47 - that works yeah it's a little bit weird
28:55 - to try to get the touch the touch stuff
28:58 - down I keep like accidentally clicking
29:03 - where I don't want to click or like
29:06 - double clicking when I don't want to see
29:09 - you Keith
29:12 - maybe it's maybe it's because I zoomed
29:14 - in let me zoom out again and see if I if
29:17 - it's better
29:19 - that's it yeah I can't win if we zoom in
29:23 - the the clicking doesn't work so I love
29:27 - it I'm going to scroll just quickly see
29:30 - if I can find something that looks weird
29:32 - and then if I do I'll scroll in on that
29:35 - I want to try out the side knife and the
29:38 - links so we'll try out this link okay
29:41 - that worked that was cool that was
29:42 - actually really fast okay
29:45 - I'm going to take I'm actually going to
29:47 - take the images out on mobile and just
29:49 - have the title up here because they
29:53 - won't look as good on mobile anyway and
29:55 - I don't I don't want to kill people's
29:57 - data plans by having them load images
30:00 - when they're not necessary all right so
30:03 - this these sections are actually going
30:05 - to change so I'm not that worried about
30:06 - it now I'm just I have some different
30:08 - content I need to put in okay so these
30:11 - cards look good on mobile everything
30:14 - works these are still need to edit these
30:17 - images to make them all square and the
30:19 - same so right now I'm looking for items
30:23 - that I I don't already know about the
30:28 - neat change alright so I am interested
30:32 - in this Oh
30:35 - so that does work if let me zoom in here
30:38 - and show you what's going on with this
30:40 - so this gave me some problems this
30:42 - morning
30:42 - some people have super long titles and
30:46 - they won't fit on the card so if they
30:50 - were rapping below and adding another
30:52 - line or sometimes two lines and then of
30:54 - course the text was spilling out of the
30:56 - bottom of this card so that the solution
31:02 - would have been okay well let's just
31:03 - make the card bigger but the problem is
31:05 - I don't have great quality images to
31:09 - work with so some of the images I have
31:10 - are already less than 100 pixels by 100
31:14 - pixels and so that's what I have here
31:16 - these are 100 by hundred pixels so I
31:18 - wanted to keep this and keep this 100
31:20 - pixels in height so I settled on this
31:23 - which I don't really like this solution
31:26 - but I just don't have time to mess with
31:30 - it more right now so I decided actually
31:32 - on a horizontal scroll so you can scroll
31:35 - over and see the rest of the title so on
31:41 - larger screens this isn't an issue if
31:45 - you think of another solution
31:49 - somebody said truncate in the live chat
31:53 - yeah I could possibly truncate it and
31:57 - then when you click it let me show what
31:58 - happens when you click when you click it
32:00 - it comes up with a modal and gives you a
32:02 - lot more information on the person so I
32:07 - could possibly truncate and then have
32:09 - the full title in the modal I've thought
32:12 - about that I'll have to I don't know if
32:16 - I'll have time to do that before we
32:17 - launch but I'm going to put that on my
32:19 - list I have a Trello board that's
32:22 - keeping track of everything since I'm
32:24 - zoomed in it's not letting me click out
32:27 - there we go
32:29 - so yeah that probably is going to be the
32:35 - best thing just truncate this limited to
32:37 - a certain number of characters and then
32:40 - have the full one
32:42 - be in the in the modal so I like that
32:46 - advise yeah
32:49 - actually that's that's what I did
32:50 - overflow wise scroll somebody mentioned
32:52 - change the font size I don't know the
32:55 - fonts already small I could probably
32:57 - make it smaller and get away with it at
32:59 - least on on mobile there's there's just
33:03 - a lot of overflow yeah I just I wish
33:09 - some of these titles weren't quite so
33:11 - long and it's not just one or two I mean
33:13 - they're like quite a few of these that
33:15 - have the super long titles so I am
33:21 - eventually going to change this for now
33:22 - this is probably how it's going to look
33:24 - for launch since we're launching
33:26 - tomorrow
33:28 - let me check to make sure this works
33:30 - oops maybe it's not working let's see am
33:36 - I getting an error okay when I click
33:44 - this it should open and it's not opening
33:48 - on this phone let me refresh really
33:51 - quick Wow oh that's not refresh that's
33:55 - wish it looked like the refresh button
33:57 - but it's really not okay so let me there
34:02 - we go
34:02 - let me find I've DS the refresh button
34:05 - on the device just to see what's going
34:11 - on okay that did work
34:21 - let's go back I've put in like
34:25 - client-side routing now I'm going to go
34:28 - back into teams to see if it works so
34:30 - the thing with client-side running if
34:32 - you watch yesterday we went over
34:33 - problems that you might have with jQuery
34:37 - ok and I think this is an issue so
34:40 - normally like I would initialize this
34:43 - this click Handler to open these and the
34:46 - document.ready function for jQuery but
34:51 - it's not going to fire like if we're
34:53 - just doing client-side routing and
34:54 - there's no page refresh that function is
34:56 - never going to fire again so the first
34:59 - time it fires it'll be honest different
35:01 - page it won't actually see those
35:02 - sections so it won't have anything to
35:05 - grab onto to to watch so what we have to
35:10 - do is instead use like component
35:13 - component did mount and then call it in
35:16 - there so we pull it out of the document
35:18 - already we put in a separate function
35:20 - that's available globally and then we
35:21 - call it from within our component when
35:23 - it mounts so for some reason either I
35:27 - forgot to do that for this or I didn't
35:29 - it's not working so I need to add that
35:31 - to the list so I'll show you how I keep
35:34 - track of all these things so go over
35:36 - here I have my Trello board so I'll just
35:40 - put it over here and say um fix uh
35:46 - section and look for routines
36:03 - or teams with client-side routing and
36:12 - I'm going to estimate that's going to
36:13 - take one Pomodoro cycle that's what this
36:14 - one is one 25-minute cycle okay somebody
36:23 - else Humberto in the live chat says they
36:27 - like the overflow ellipsis option yeah I
36:31 - think that'll look that'll look ok we'll
36:33 - probably end up going with that at some
36:35 - point and all right so now that that bug
36:40 - is it's tracked I'll get to it let's
36:45 - let's move on I'm actually doing a
36:47 - similar thing in another page so I
36:49 - really want to see if it's working on
36:51 - the other page and did I do it
36:53 - differently on two different pages so
36:54 - we're going to go over to courses and
37:00 - let's see if it works here all right it
37:07 - doesn't so I'm having the same issue on
37:09 - both these pages so let's just go back
37:11 - and add four teams and sort and courses
37:23 - look good
37:29 - all right so good thing this is a small
37:31 - site we're already halfway through it
37:34 - let's check out the events page see
37:37 - what's going on here and not a lot we
37:38 - have that's not bad maybe you could use
37:43 - some padding changes but it it doesn't
37:46 - look too bad
37:48 - that's excellent or to read on that
37:51 - background doesn't it this let me zoom
37:54 - in maybe it's just the zoom so I will
38:01 - try to zoom that was that what's broken
38:08 - I been here for like the frame of the
38:13 - word in YouTube okay oh the YouTube has
38:16 - the YouTube embed messed this up see if
38:21 - we can well it looks like a frozen my my
38:29 - test here so maybe if I can't get this
38:34 - to work again we'll switch and test
38:37 - something else and then come back to
38:38 - this one hmm
38:43 - okay so that's frozen so let's let's
38:47 - switch over now just for a minute and
38:50 - I'll show you what let's check out we'll
38:54 - do Windows 10 and let's check out
38:58 - Internet Explorer 11
39:11 - hopefully I won't have to worry about
39:13 - supporting this for very much longer but
39:16 - you can see I always have issues with in
39:20 - an explorer 11 and mobile safari a lot
39:24 - of the issues I know about beforehand so
39:26 - I can I can edit my my code to make sure
39:31 - that I fix them but you can see like I
39:34 - was using flexbox to vertical line
39:38 - things see it's not working in an
39:41 - explorer 11 so you have to set up
39:45 - alternate styles for internet explorer
39:48 - 11 some padding or something as we
39:53 - scroll down at least this works and
40:01 - let's go go to the home page see how
40:07 - this is gone we have here okay so for
40:16 - some reason the images aren't loading
40:22 - off to check that out we can also we can
40:30 - inspect but the inspector is not is not
40:39 - great for this so you can't have to have
40:42 - a lot of patience to inspect things when
40:46 - you're working with older browsers it
40:49 - said it may take a few minutes to start
40:51 - I don't think I want to wait a few
40:53 - minutes let's just this is good a team
40:56 - now we're also using oh man look at that
41:02 - Wow
41:04 - so that scrollbar shows up because even
41:08 - though we're not actually there's no
41:09 - overflow that scrollbar so show them
41:12 - that's no good all right I'm gonna have
41:18 - to figure out if there's a way to hide
41:23 - the scrollbar
41:24 - and in and explore 11
41:37 - and I don't want to spend too much time
41:39 - I'm going to give myself one Pomodoro
41:42 - session so one 25 minute period because
41:46 - I if I can't find answer quickly I'll
41:49 - probably it'll be a waste of time I
41:51 - don't have all that time right now so I
41:54 - kind of think that you can't hide these
41:56 - but we'll see maybe maybe there's a way
42:00 - I know you could do more with scroll
42:02 - bars and like earlier versions of
42:04 - Internet Explorer I remember making like
42:06 - neon green colored scroll bars made like
42:12 - 15 years ago or so I think but I haven't
42:15 - done that for a while and I don't know
42:16 - if you can still do it let's go to the
42:19 - news page and I just want to see if ok
42:24 - so that's that routing that
42:26 - parameterised routing that we had set up
42:29 - it's definitely working and that's good
42:31 - check our resources ok let's see I want
42:39 - to see if these tabs will all the
42:40 - scrolls like not great on this okay so
42:50 - to see now this isn't working
42:52 - so our our tabs are not working so let's
42:58 - put this oops
43:12 - so as expected Internet Explorer 11 is
43:18 - giving us some some issues it doesn't
43:20 - matter what you do it's your site's
43:23 - never going to look as good and Explorer
43:26 - 11 as it will in more in modern browsers
43:29 - I mean unless your site's really simple
43:31 - it might look exactly the same but you
43:34 - just can't take advantage of all the
43:36 - same things that you normally would
43:39 - would be able to in a modern browser so
43:41 - we're not going to try to make this site
43:43 - exactly the same the percentage of our
43:47 - users that are on Internet Explorer 11
43:50 - is really small if the issues were like
43:54 - a really a big deal
43:57 - like major functionality and menu is use
44:01 - then you can just put a message I hate
44:05 - to do this sometimes you have to you can
44:08 - just pop a message up that detects the
44:09 - browser and says you know hey if you're
44:11 - using Internet Explorer you're not going
44:15 - to have a great experience and then
44:17 - provide a link to download you know some
44:19 - newer browsers you don't even have to
44:22 - write that code yourself there's already
44:23 - some plugins that will just do it for
44:25 - you so I'm going to check the live chat
44:32 - real quick because I just wanted to show
44:36 - you how I'm doing my testing I think
44:38 - it's probably a little bit boring to
44:40 - watch me go through here and just find
44:43 - the errors and log them I'm not actually
44:44 - fixing anything right now so I don't
44:48 - want to spend a ton of time on it I'm
44:50 - going to check the live chat quickly and
44:52 - then I have a video another video from
44:55 - syntax con with some advice for new
44:58 - programmers and this this video is from
45:02 - Kim Creighton shoes and excellent
45:04 - speakers she was one of like the keynote
45:06 - speakers at the conference and she's
45:10 - actually not a coder but she speaks at a
45:12 - ton of coding conferences and it was
45:18 - great if you ever have a chance to see
45:20 - her speak or watch one her videos I
45:22 - recommend it it's like
45:24 - she is nice like perspective on like
45:27 - mentoring and company culture so it's
45:31 - really really kind of cool stuff you
45:35 - don't usually hear at tech conferences
45:38 - okay let me check okay so I was getting
45:47 - some people talking about the question I
45:49 - asked at the beginning about auth0 and
45:53 - in the emails and stuff
45:55 - somebody says could there be a problem
45:56 - with SMTP it's possible okay so I did
46:06 - mention how to do the Android testing
46:09 - and someone a live chat said it's the
46:12 - tutorial on how to do that isn't the
46:14 - responsive design for images course on
46:16 - Udacity that's a free course I did go
46:19 - through that course I recommend it I
46:22 - learned a lot of stuff and a lot of the
46:25 - things in there are still very relevant
46:27 - even though the courses on a probably a
46:30 - couple years old at this point I can't
46:32 - remember when it came out officially but
46:34 - the things that I learned in that course
46:36 - are still still relevant someone
46:43 - mentioned that they don't devote for
46:44 - edge but it can be surprisingly
46:46 - compatible yeah I had a lot of hope for
46:49 - edge but it's just not a lot of people
46:52 - aren't using it based on my analytics
46:54 - for my sites it's there a small
46:56 - percentage of people so that's why I
46:58 - don't usually test things on edge it's
47:02 - just not worth the time you know for
47:04 - like 1% of the users
47:17 - okay
47:27 - okay someone mentioned materialized does
47:29 - have the truncate class that's right I
47:32 - forgot about that so there is a truncate
47:35 - class the only I'll have to see how they
47:40 - do it on with materialized I know there
47:47 - was actually some like CSS truncation
47:50 - that can go on but I don't know what the
47:53 - browser support is but that's a good
47:55 - that's a good point
47:56 - I'm definitely going to going to check
47:59 - that out if someone said that a slow
48:08 - connection they couldn't see the title
48:09 - bar sorry about that oh nice okay John
48:15 - Hanson thank you very much he threw in
48:17 - some of the CSS to be able to hide the
48:22 - scroll bar so that definitely saves you
48:25 - some time and I need some time savers
48:29 - here so I really appreciate that
48:35 - Patrick asked since you're estimating
48:38 - pomodoro cycles to use a Pomodoro clock
48:40 - while you work I do so I use a Pomodoro
48:43 - clock oh let me show you the one I use I
48:48 - use just a super simple web-based one
48:53 - since this tomato timer so it's really
48:57 - bare-bones I can do formula recession of
49:00 - 25 minutes your short break of five
49:02 - minutes or long break of 10 I usually go
49:05 - five minutes between cycles every four
49:07 - cycles I do 10-minute break and I just
49:11 - use this I like it you know runs right
49:13 - in the browser so it's easy I tried out
49:15 - some apps before that have more features
49:17 - but usually I don't use any of the other
49:20 - features so it just kind of clutters
49:21 - things so using this right now at some
49:23 - point I'd like to actually build my own
49:25 - and customize it to exactly what I need
49:28 - but I don't have time for that right now
49:31 - maybe one day okay
49:37 - Paul asks how is he sliding the full
49:39 - screen
49:40 - then right I'm on a Mac so yes so if
49:44 - you're using the touchpad for your Mac
49:48 - on a laptop or on a desktop and you use
49:51 - three fingers and swipe it then that'll
49:54 - that will change it so this is just a
49:56 - three-finger swipe so it's super helpful
50:02 - there is a way to make that work on
50:04 - Windows it's you have to download a
50:06 - program and set it up but I'm pretty
50:08 - sure you can get a similar thing on
50:10 - Windows I mean I don't know what you
50:14 - obviously wouldn't probably would be
50:15 - using a touchpad on Windows desktop but
50:17 - there would be probably some type of key
50:19 - I think there's a key combination like
50:21 - control some there's some like key combo
50:26 - that can do this on a Mac as well if you
50:28 - don't want to use the the swipes okay so
50:39 - get through the live chat if you have
50:41 - anything else to ask go ahead I'll check
50:42 - it one more time after I play this video
50:45 - but let me get with the video going this
50:48 - one's a little bit longer Kim had a lot
50:51 - of good advice so this will be a few
50:53 - minutes most of the other videos have
50:55 - been like a minute or less so let me
50:59 - bring in I'll bring this in and let's
51:07 - make it fullscreen and let me let me
51:13 - play this uh hopefully the audio is is
51:17 - works there's at one point at the end of
51:19 - this I think there's some background
51:20 - noise so I hope you'll be able to hear
51:23 - this and once again this is this is Kim
51:26 - Creighton from syntax con hello everyone
51:32 - I'm Tim Creighton and you can find my
51:34 - Twitter it Khem creative board in this
51:37 - ki elements are elección in one I am
51:42 - here at six hack conference and one of
51:47 - the things that I'm supposed to say
51:51 - what's knowledge now exciting
51:52 - first first of all Benton right I'm a
51:55 - community engineer which means I help
51:57 - community efforts I help people in the
52:01 - technology space embrace change the
52:05 - convoy elusive and diversity diverse
52:07 - when it comes to people there is
52:10 - backgrounds become a welcomed use like a

52:51 - very exciting a friend they I went to
52:54 - their house and they had set it up in
52:56 - their house and I spent two hours plan
52:59 - is free of your system and by the time I
53:02 - was done I was four ounce with but I've
53:05 - had so much fun so I'm really interested
53:07 - in seeing how that technology is that
53:10 - advanced where it will be less about the
53:14 - gear and more accessible to other people
53:17 - how are you using it in just in everyday
53:20 - life it will be very interesting to how
53:22 - they I and a mini reality - I mean a are
53:27 - augmented reality and virtual reality
53:29 - are going to be used in just everyday
53:32 - lives and so the one thing I would tell
53:35 - newbies one of the pieces of Isis that's
53:37 - become is all time is about mentoring so
53:39 - everybody to become creative reading
53:42 - it's virtually impossible for most
53:44 - people who come to you they're very live
53:45 - without on the mentor just for the
53:48 - simple fact that this is like the Wild
53:50 - West
53:50 - there is no there is no defined path
53:54 - winners if you want to be a doctor
53:55 - there's a divine path if you want to be
53:57 - a dentist there's a defined path if you
53:59 - want to be educated in SIA pet if you
54:02 - want to be a developer you go
54:03 - taxi garbage gets to me and wake up
54:05 - today dislike one of your developer and
54:07 - can learn everything you need to learn
54:08 - to be a developer so there's no more fun
54:10 - iPad and without somebody more similar
54:12 - to help guy what you're doing you often
54:15 - find yourself and you've down this
54:16 - rabbit holes or feeling really
54:18 - discouraged and so mentors really help
54:20 - but I'll give you some advice on how to
54:22 - get an intern mentoring it's all the
54:24 - mouth relationships so if one image
54:29 - don't go to some lesson hey I need a
54:30 - mentor this is what I want to learn
54:32 - that's not how that works
54:33 - oh you want somebody who's going to
54:35 - invest in you and your success and that
54:37 - only happens in the care that they care
54:39 - about you know where they're going to
54:40 - care about you is if they have a
54:43 - relationship with you so five ways to
54:45 - volunteer in your community a lot of
54:48 - ways to ask my ways to ask how can I
54:53 - help for you ask them to help you and
54:56 - what happens is you'll find that they'll
54:59 - go to you they'll see this or asking you
55:01 - hey what are you working on how can I
55:03 - help and then it becomes like them
55:05 - you're advocating that's what you want
55:06 - they want your first job to come from
55:08 - your network you don't want to get your
55:10 - first job because it was posted on the
55:12 - website you want to be there so badly
55:14 - about you before they of a full set job
55:16 - you want to be the candidate before
55:17 - their jobs even post it so the best way
55:19 - to do that is to build your
55:20 - relationships and get you over time
55:23 - thank you
55:27 - all right so hopefully that was helpful
55:30 - to some of you I know I am I think a
55:36 - mentor would be really helpful I didn't
55:37 - really have I kind of had a mentor uh
55:41 - but it was more in like in general like
55:47 - digital marketing so search engine
55:49 - optimization and SUV by copywriting and
55:51 - things so I never really had like a
55:54 - programmer mentor and even now I you
55:58 - know I already have a full-time job
56:00 - doing this I can still see the value and
56:02 - having a mentor and I've been able to be
56:05 - somewhat of a mentor to to some some of
56:10 - the students here who are interested in
56:13 - programming and it's it's awesome
56:17 - I mean you know I can see whenever I
56:21 - help people out make it they get through
56:25 - things a lot faster than I get through
56:27 - things because I can point them to a
56:29 - resource that I know is good I know the
56:33 - problems that they'll probably run into
56:35 - before they do
56:36 - so whereas it would take me a long time
56:39 - and I would work through some resources
56:42 - that weren't very helpful before I found
56:44 - the right ones you know if if you're
56:49 - mentoring someone you can help them get
56:50 - through that faster or if you're seeking
56:52 - out a mentor they can help you get
56:54 - through that faster so you just don't
56:56 - waste your time going down dead-end
56:59 - paths people that have been doing this
57:03 - for longer have a much better idea of of
57:06 - the big picture and I can can direct you
57:09 - to where you need to go and what you
57:11 - need to learn so good advice from from
57:15 - Kim and I don't see all right we don't
57:19 - have any other questions in the live
57:20 - chat so I'm going to get to work
57:23 - tomorrow we're going to launch this site
57:25 - so the video that might already be
57:27 - launched by the time I do the video
57:29 - tomorrow I'm hoping it is maybe I'll
57:32 - have to just stay up late tonight and
57:35 - tomorrow and get it launched tomorrow
57:37 - night but hopefully it'll be ready
57:39 - enough to launch thanks for all your
57:42 - help I know you all put in some some
57:44 - really good advice too you know I asked
57:48 - a lot of questions of you this time
57:51 - around and I really really appreciate
57:53 - that hopefully when I do these live
57:56 - streams we can learn from each other and
58:00 - your projects will get better and so
58:02 - will mine thanks so much for watching
58:05 - and I'll be back tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jesse and today I'm sick so I apologize if I'm a little bit harder to hear today or a little out of it but I don't have time to be sick because we got to launch this site so the site's going to launch tomorrow we need to do some testing I'm going to test using browser stack and also with the device so I have the pixel XL and I'm just I have it connected directly to my iMac and we're going to use dev tools and test on the device I did want to show you how to test simulate an iPhone with Xcode but I tried to start it two minutes ago and it wanted me to download extra stuff for it to work that's not going to happen so sorry about that ideally for it it's better if you actually have a fun and iPhone to test it on if you can get a hold of one I found the simulator isn't always accurate you get the Xcode simulator so some other people that I work with have fun so I'm just going to borrow one of their funds later on and test because based on the analytics for some of our other sites a lot of users are going to be on an iPhone so the browsers that we need to worry about most based on the analytics are chrome which we should be fine in chrome we've been developing it in from the whole way so I'm not as worried about that and Safari specifically Mobile Safari which I always have problems with on my list of least favorite browsers Mobile Safari might be worse than edited Explorer for me so I mean at least worse than Internet Explorer 11 we will try out internet explorer 11 I don't think I'm going to bother with edge because our analytics show it's such a small percentage of our users are using edge it's probably not a good use of our time at this point if I had more time I'd maybe give it a try so let's get started with some testing oh hey everybody I just looked at the live chat some people saying hello I've a question for it for all of you if I'm having an issue with one of my other site so I'm going to throw this out there and y'all can think about it and comment or direct message me or something if you have a good answer I'm using I have an app where users have to log in I'm using auth0 for authentication it's one of the magic link logins so they get an email with a link when they click the link they're logged in and it saves everything in the browser's local storage and they're supposed to stay logged in unless they actually log themselves out with the log out button so I'm having two problems one users keep getting logged out and they're saying that they haven't tried to log out they can't remember what they can't remember ever like running some type of program that would have logged them out like cleared out all their local storage so basically they're getting logged out for no apparent reason and I haven't been able to recreate the issue I've tried probably dozens of times have gone to the you know different computers that the actual computers where it's happening for the users and I can't get it to happen again and then the other issue is when they try to log back in and have that that magic link sent to them again they're not seeing the emails I'm using SendGrid for emails and the SendGrid analytics it says that the emails are actually delivered but they're not they're not showing up in their inbox or in the junk mail folders for these people so just just one of anyone using either SendGrid or r0 or both of them together if you've had any issues like that especially issues with local storage being cleared out randomly from the browser or with emails some some people just not getting emails on the same system I'm on the same email system and I tested it earlier I got the email within a minute so I don't the issues so sorry for the little sidebar there let's get back to the testing so basically the first thing I want to do is show you how to set up the a mobile device for testing so there's not a lot you have to do actually on the phone so I'm not going to show you the phone part of it but you can look it up it's usually it's pretty easy you'd have to go into your settings under your advanced settings and there's like a developer mode I think you have to click on the version number in settings like seven times it's really weird I'm this is for Android by the way so I you can hook up an iPhone and do debugging as well but it's a different since I don't have an iPhone right now I'm not going to go over that maybe we'll do it in a different video so basically you have to enable developer options and you do that by I can't remember exactly what you clicked I've already done it but I think it's like the Android version number when you go into settings and about and you have to click it I think seven times and then will ask you do want to enable developer options yes and then you have this extra thing in your menu this extra item so you can go into there and enable USB debugging so that's what you want you want to be able to enable USB debugging so if you haven't Android you want to do this Google enable USB debugging on and and it will let you know exactly what the steps are since I camera I'm almost positive that the way I described it is how it went but it's been so long since I've done it I can't be sure so you probably want to doublecheck I don't have a link right now so sorry if I if I have time and I remember which I probably want I'll throw the link in the description normally I would throw the link in but I'm just really pressed for time to get this site launched so now I'm going to show you how to link up your device so if you open up dev tools okay which you can just click on inspect anywhere and that will open up dev tools for you let me how's the font on dev tools do I need to make it bigger let me know alright somebody in a live chat said it's not the Android version number it's the compilation number or something like that I think you're right I can't remember it was some some number in there I know that's not great information but I'm you'll be able to find it the information is really easy to find if you want like a step by step if you go to Udacity they actually show you this in in one of their courses they have like a link to a video it's their course on my like mobile is a responsive images something like that sorry that's not good advice I think so let me make this bigger and move this up here so you can see what's going on okay so we have some of the live chat saying we do need it bigger okay that's probably as big as I can make it without blocking out stuff that we need to see so all I've done is I've connected my my phone to the computer so I have for this phone it's one of the USBC so I have a connector that's just a regular USB on one end and then a new USBC on the other end going into my phone so that's plugged in I've enabled USB debugging on my phone now I just open dev tools and I go I click on this it probably will be clicked on by default discover USB devices when I do that then it brings up this pixel so I can see it over here and I'll actually if you click it it will show you open windows that you have I've done one other steps since we're developing this locally if you're not testing a site locally if you're testing a site that's available you know online from a normal URL you can skip this step but since we have a local server running we want to match up the ports so I just used localhost 8080 this first number is for my phone the second one is what port we're running it on so I'm actually running this local server on port 3000 so I just I added a rule when I entered these two numbers in now when I go on my phone to localhost 8080 I can actually see the development side I know you guys can't see it I was trying to I have a program there let me share my phone screen but for some reason it wasn't working I kind of think that because I'm using the ports it's like one of the ports that that was also using and so I messed it up but I didn't really have time to troubleshoot so now that you're linked up you can go I can go into my pixel and see I have been saying the port forwarding is working and I want to inspect let's enter URL so you can I can enter this localhost 8080 and click open and this should work okay I guess not there we go it just took a second but see it on my phone it just opened it and now I can see that tab here that localhost8080 and now I can it inspect okay and now my inspector it's taking a second to load but now this section once it loads this section will actually correspond to what's on my phone so the cool thing is now if I go over and change some Styles here it'll show up on my phone in real time so I can test it out it's a little bit nicer than just kind of shrinking your window because you get to you'll really see like how if you have let's say some type of scroll tracking or click function or something you can see how it is with the touch I know you can simulate some of this with dev tools but if you have a device you don't have to have every device if you just get one device and try things out on it it's really worthwhile so in general I just you know click around and see see what's working what's not working so there's definitely some delay so just a headsup on that every time I go to click on a link it doesn't refresh right away there's this a delay so alright so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that I just wanted to show you how to set that up because I didn't get the screen sharing working so it'd be really boring for you all to have me describe to you what I'm saying on my mobile the next way I'm going to test is with browser stacks I have this somewhere where did I put it okay here it is okay so we have thanks for the ports it sorry I'm just checking the live chat for a second make sure okay it looks like there's we don't have any questions or anything everybody's still following alright so I'm going to go in here in a browser stack now I can I normally just use Xcode since I'm on a Mac and I test directly on my Mac instead of going in to a browser stack but since I have have to install updates before that'll work let's go in we'll just try this iPhone 6's I don't have a lot of like really good analytics data on the actual type of iPhone devices exercise I don't know my screen is maybe 27 I sorry I just lost my train of thought if you're just joining in you missed at the beginning I apologize in advance I'm really not feeling well so the the streams going to be a little bit a little bit off I'm just not going to be as as on top of things as I normally would be so you have to wait this is browser stack is it's pretty good hey this is it actually saved the last site I looked at on here probably not me this is a somebody we share an account me and another developer so that's probably it's like he was testing so basically I I have a phone here I don't know if I can make this bigger so I'm sorry if this is small it looks small for me so I'll just give you kind of an idea of how to do this now some things on browserstack allow you to do port forwarding last time I use this which is within the last few months you could not do it with the iPhones so I'm not going to try to do it right now you can do it I think with Windows based things windowsbased browsers so you might want to check that out that would also be cool so in this case I'm just going to go to our test you are out and it's it's pretty much up to date there's a couple of things I did that I didn't push to the to the server yet but for the most part test code catechins calm let's see okay it's not it's not working let me go back here and see if it's working on on my brother okay wow it is working let me refresh one more son good thing we're testing let's try to go to maybe one of the interior pages see if we have a better look No all right now we can't open dev tools here so let's open dev tools and see what we're getting can't find variable and it's unexpected NFR this card hmm all right let's see where this is that it's possible it's not showing me hmm let's see I want to go and shovel it looks like it's not even loading I want to check to make sure okay it is loading our our app all right dodge it is okay okay it's linked two of them all right so what did it say 121 this this card team card clickhandler okay yeah the lab says somebody asks is browserstack free there is a free trial it doesn't let you do a lot though so yeah this is not a free tool yeah you can use Xcode to simulate an iPhone on your computer for free if you have a Mac so I would normally I like to use that better than trying to simulate iPhones and browserstack and then if you have a device the actual physical device of course you can test with that but I think probably what's happening with the iPhone and I'll need to I'm going to test this with an actual device just so it's a little bit faster for me after I update Xcode probably what's happening and I don't know why this just slipped my mind before is I'm using a lot of things from es6 I don't know what the coverage is on mobile safari for es6 it's possible that that's messing some of this this up I don't know we'll see yeah because the first the first time I use something that's es6 is at line 21 and I'm using let instead of their and that's the first error we got so I'm guessing Mobile Safari does not support let so I'll have to use Babel and transpile that into es5 code and then try again on an iPhone but what we can do is try to go I don't think I have a page that isn't using some type of es6 we can transpile real quick and do it I mean we have that might be worthwhile worthwhile to do so if you've never used es6 or babel before let's try it out okay so you need to let's see let me grab all of my app touches so basically this JavaScript that you're writing in your components you're fine with it's going to be automatically transpired but since we imported this a tas file from our previous static site then we just brought it in and have it in the static folder i next doesn't automatically transpile that for you that's something I'd have to set up probably as an NPM script in the package.json file so I have not set that up yet I've set it up in a previous project at some point I'm probably just going to copy that code into there but I haven't done it yet so what we can do now is just kind of manually transpile this just so that we can do some testing so I just copy this in on this side and you can see using let me make this bigger I'll make this whole thing bigger okay so on this side we have some es6 stuffs we have let what else we have I'm probably using cost in some places too I'm using template literal syntax so we go over to this side we can see that let has been changed into two there and I'm not going to look for the template literal syntax but if you basically what it would do is just use regular quotation marks and you know your plus signs mix in with your variables so your file is going to be a little bit bigger after you do this but older browsers will be able to use it so I'm just going to copy this for now and let's see what the best way to do this I I'm just going to I'm just going to go and paste this all in and overwrite this file for now because we have this this saves the lemming let me just throw this in another file just to say that okay just in case we need to go back okay so let's save and we're going to go over I'm going to put this on the server really quick it should take probably two minutes I'll let you guys see this I showed everybody yesterday but just in case you don't know how I'm putting things on the server right now this is the tooth let's make this a bit bigger okay so this is my local machine I'm just going to do a git commit so we're just going to transpile we're going to push that to github and then let's go back here I've just used SSH to go into the server on digital ocean and now I'm in to see them it looks different a username Jessie now we're going to go into our folder and we're going to stop stop our our app for just a minute we'll do a get pool and we'll do we'll do a build as soon as this builds over we'll just start up our server again and then we're good to go with our testing we go right back in now we shouldn't get the errors from the ESX stuff so so I didn't think of that beforehand just working on a lot of other stuff today and I did not think about it okay so Patrick and a live chat says can I use as mobile safari should support let since late last year okay well I'm not sure what the problem was then I mean we're definitely getting an error on the the line that I first used let with so I'm not actually I don't remember what version of Safari I was testing with browser stack it's possible that I was testing an older version we'll go back in and see what the version is all right so now our build is ready let me start everything up and we should be good to go so let's go back over here and let's try oops let's try to go back all right and it works so I'm not sure what what the problem was for sure I think it was let and this is probably just an older version of Safari but now at least we can scroll down let me see if I can make this bigger hmm all right since device is already to actual size so I guess it's not okay so this is browsers iOS 9 so this is Safari in an iOS version 9 what's the newest one is it is 10 okay so nice you gather you already uncovered in the live chat support for 4 let which is an es6 thing starts in version 10.2 ok and somebody mentions something about the auth0 stuff I don't want to interrupt right now so towards the end I'm going to come back to that thanks for for mentioning that I'll just say for now I'm not using an iframe to log out on the log out is basically I just clear local storage when they click the button but people are saying that they're not clicking the button and the local storage is still being cleared when I go to check their their browsers there's nothing in local storage but I can't get it to clear on you know just on its own again I can't recreate the problem ok so I'm going to scroll down a little bit I realize this is super small yeah and I don't I don't know how to to make this bigger except to I can zoom into the site itself let's see if I can zoom in here all right okay so the uh you know just the zoom from the touchpad on an eye and I like the iMac magic touch pad works okay so we got a little bigger here so I'm just going to scroll you don't get like the real feeling of scrolling I'm you know I'm using my touchpad to scroll but we can do some some clicking around okay so that works yeah it's a little bit weird to try to get the touch the touch stuff down I keep like accidentally clicking where I don't want to click or like double clicking when I don't want to see you Keith maybe it's maybe it's because I zoomed in let me zoom out again and see if I if it's better that's it yeah I can't win if we zoom in the the clicking doesn't work so I love it I'm going to scroll just quickly see if I can find something that looks weird and then if I do I'll scroll in on that I want to try out the side knife and the links so we'll try out this link okay that worked that was cool that was actually really fast okay I'm going to take I'm actually going to take the images out on mobile and just have the title up here because they won't look as good on mobile anyway and I don't I don't want to kill people's data plans by having them load images when they're not necessary all right so this these sections are actually going to change so I'm not that worried about it now I'm just I have some different content I need to put in okay so these cards look good on mobile everything works these are still need to edit these images to make them all square and the same so right now I'm looking for items that I I don't already know about the neat change alright so I am interested in this Oh so that does work if let me zoom in here and show you what's going on with this so this gave me some problems this morning some people have super long titles and they won't fit on the card so if they were rapping below and adding another line or sometimes two lines and then of course the text was spilling out of the bottom of this card so that the solution would have been okay well let's just make the card bigger but the problem is I don't have great quality images to work with so some of the images I have are already less than 100 pixels by 100 pixels and so that's what I have here these are 100 by hundred pixels so I wanted to keep this and keep this 100 pixels in height so I settled on this which I don't really like this solution but I just don't have time to mess with it more right now so I decided actually on a horizontal scroll so you can scroll over and see the rest of the title so on larger screens this isn't an issue if you think of another solution somebody said truncate in the live chat yeah I could possibly truncate it and then when you click it let me show what happens when you click when you click it it comes up with a modal and gives you a lot more information on the person so I could possibly truncate and then have the full title in the modal I've thought about that I'll have to I don't know if I'll have time to do that before we launch but I'm going to put that on my list I have a Trello board that's keeping track of everything since I'm zoomed in it's not letting me click out there we go so yeah that probably is going to be the best thing just truncate this limited to a certain number of characters and then have the full one be in the in the modal so I like that advise yeah actually that's that's what I did overflow wise scroll somebody mentioned change the font size I don't know the fonts already small I could probably make it smaller and get away with it at least on on mobile there's there's just a lot of overflow yeah I just I wish some of these titles weren't quite so long and it's not just one or two I mean they're like quite a few of these that have the super long titles so I am eventually going to change this for now this is probably how it's going to look for launch since we're launching tomorrow let me check to make sure this works oops maybe it's not working let's see am I getting an error okay when I click this it should open and it's not opening on this phone let me refresh really quick Wow oh that's not refresh that's wish it looked like the refresh button but it's really not okay so let me there we go let me find I've DS the refresh button on the device just to see what's going on okay that did work let's go back I've put in like clientside routing now I'm going to go back into teams to see if it works so the thing with clientside running if you watch yesterday we went over problems that you might have with jQuery ok and I think this is an issue so normally like I would initialize this this click Handler to open these and the document.ready function for jQuery but it's not going to fire like if we're just doing clientside routing and there's no page refresh that function is never going to fire again so the first time it fires it'll be honest different page it won't actually see those sections so it won't have anything to grab onto to to watch so what we have to do is instead use like component component did mount and then call it in there so we pull it out of the document already we put in a separate function that's available globally and then we call it from within our component when it mounts so for some reason either I forgot to do that for this or I didn't it's not working so I need to add that to the list so I'll show you how I keep track of all these things so go over here I have my Trello board so I'll just put it over here and say um fix uh section and look for routines or teams with clientside routing and I'm going to estimate that's going to take one Pomodoro cycle that's what this one is one 25minute cycle okay somebody else Humberto in the live chat says they like the overflow ellipsis option yeah I think that'll look that'll look ok we'll probably end up going with that at some point and all right so now that that bug is it's tracked I'll get to it let's let's move on I'm actually doing a similar thing in another page so I really want to see if it's working on the other page and did I do it differently on two different pages so we're going to go over to courses and let's see if it works here all right it doesn't so I'm having the same issue on both these pages so let's just go back and add four teams and sort and courses look good all right so good thing this is a small site we're already halfway through it let's check out the events page see what's going on here and not a lot we have that's not bad maybe you could use some padding changes but it it doesn't look too bad that's excellent or to read on that background doesn't it this let me zoom in maybe it's just the zoom so I will try to zoom that was that what's broken I been here for like the frame of the word in YouTube okay oh the YouTube has the YouTube embed messed this up see if we can well it looks like a frozen my my test here so maybe if I can't get this to work again we'll switch and test something else and then come back to this one hmm okay so that's frozen so let's let's switch over now just for a minute and I'll show you what let's check out we'll do Windows 10 and let's check out Internet Explorer 11 hopefully I won't have to worry about supporting this for very much longer but you can see I always have issues with in an explorer 11 and mobile safari a lot of the issues I know about beforehand so I can I can edit my my code to make sure that I fix them but you can see like I was using flexbox to vertical line things see it's not working in an explorer 11 so you have to set up alternate styles for internet explorer 11 some padding or something as we scroll down at least this works and let's go go to the home page see how this is gone we have here okay so for some reason the images aren't loading off to check that out we can also we can inspect but the inspector is not is not great for this so you can't have to have a lot of patience to inspect things when you're working with older browsers it said it may take a few minutes to start I don't think I want to wait a few minutes let's just this is good a team now we're also using oh man look at that Wow so that scrollbar shows up because even though we're not actually there's no overflow that scrollbar so show them that's no good all right I'm gonna have to figure out if there's a way to hide the scrollbar and in and explore 11 and I don't want to spend too much time I'm going to give myself one Pomodoro session so one 25 minute period because I if I can't find answer quickly I'll probably it'll be a waste of time I don't have all that time right now so I kind of think that you can't hide these but we'll see maybe maybe there's a way I know you could do more with scroll bars and like earlier versions of Internet Explorer I remember making like neon green colored scroll bars made like 15 years ago or so I think but I haven't done that for a while and I don't know if you can still do it let's go to the news page and I just want to see if ok so that's that routing that parameterised routing that we had set up it's definitely working and that's good check our resources ok let's see I want to see if these tabs will all the scrolls like not great on this okay so to see now this isn't working so our our tabs are not working so let's put this oops so as expected Internet Explorer 11 is giving us some some issues it doesn't matter what you do it's your site's never going to look as good and Explorer 11 as it will in more in modern browsers I mean unless your site's really simple it might look exactly the same but you just can't take advantage of all the same things that you normally would would be able to in a modern browser so we're not going to try to make this site exactly the same the percentage of our users that are on Internet Explorer 11 is really small if the issues were like a really a big deal like major functionality and menu is use then you can just put a message I hate to do this sometimes you have to you can just pop a message up that detects the browser and says you know hey if you're using Internet Explorer you're not going to have a great experience and then provide a link to download you know some newer browsers you don't even have to write that code yourself there's already some plugins that will just do it for you so I'm going to check the live chat real quick because I just wanted to show you how I'm doing my testing I think it's probably a little bit boring to watch me go through here and just find the errors and log them I'm not actually fixing anything right now so I don't want to spend a ton of time on it I'm going to check the live chat quickly and then I have a video another video from syntax con with some advice for new programmers and this this video is from Kim Creighton shoes and excellent speakers she was one of like the keynote speakers at the conference and she's actually not a coder but she speaks at a ton of coding conferences and it was great if you ever have a chance to see her speak or watch one her videos I recommend it it's like she is nice like perspective on like mentoring and company culture so it's really really kind of cool stuff you don't usually hear at tech conferences okay let me check okay so I was getting some people talking about the question I asked at the beginning about auth0 and in the emails and stuff somebody says could there be a problem with SMTP it's possible okay so I did mention how to do the Android testing and someone a live chat said it's the tutorial on how to do that isn't the responsive design for images course on Udacity that's a free course I did go through that course I recommend it I learned a lot of stuff and a lot of the things in there are still very relevant even though the courses on a probably a couple years old at this point I can't remember when it came out officially but the things that I learned in that course are still still relevant someone mentioned that they don't devote for edge but it can be surprisingly compatible yeah I had a lot of hope for edge but it's just not a lot of people aren't using it based on my analytics for my sites it's there a small percentage of people so that's why I don't usually test things on edge it's just not worth the time you know for like 1% of the users okay okay someone mentioned materialized does have the truncate class that's right I forgot about that so there is a truncate class the only I'll have to see how they do it on with materialized I know there was actually some like CSS truncation that can go on but I don't know what the browser support is but that's a good that's a good point I'm definitely going to going to check that out if someone said that a slow connection they couldn't see the title bar sorry about that oh nice okay John Hanson thank you very much he threw in some of the CSS to be able to hide the scroll bar so that definitely saves you some time and I need some time savers here so I really appreciate that Patrick asked since you're estimating pomodoro cycles to use a Pomodoro clock while you work I do so I use a Pomodoro clock oh let me show you the one I use I use just a super simple webbased one since this tomato timer so it's really barebones I can do formula recession of 25 minutes your short break of five minutes or long break of 10 I usually go five minutes between cycles every four cycles I do 10minute break and I just use this I like it you know runs right in the browser so it's easy I tried out some apps before that have more features but usually I don't use any of the other features so it just kind of clutters things so using this right now at some point I'd like to actually build my own and customize it to exactly what I need but I don't have time for that right now maybe one day okay Paul asks how is he sliding the full screen then right I'm on a Mac so yes so if you're using the touchpad for your Mac on a laptop or on a desktop and you use three fingers and swipe it then that'll that will change it so this is just a threefinger swipe so it's super helpful there is a way to make that work on Windows it's you have to download a program and set it up but I'm pretty sure you can get a similar thing on Windows I mean I don't know what you obviously wouldn't probably would be using a touchpad on Windows desktop but there would be probably some type of key I think there's a key combination like control some there's some like key combo that can do this on a Mac as well if you don't want to use the the swipes okay so get through the live chat if you have anything else to ask go ahead I'll check it one more time after I play this video but let me get with the video going this one's a little bit longer Kim had a lot of good advice so this will be a few minutes most of the other videos have been like a minute or less so let me bring in I'll bring this in and let's make it fullscreen and let me let me play this uh hopefully the audio is is works there's at one point at the end of this I think there's some background noise so I hope you'll be able to hear this and once again this is this is Kim Creighton from syntax con hello everyone I'm Tim Creighton and you can find my Twitter it Khem creative board in this ki elements are elección in one I am here at six hack conference and one of the things that I'm supposed to say what's knowledge now exciting first first of all Benton right I'm a community engineer which means I help community efforts I help people in the technology space embrace change the convoy elusive and diversity diverse when it comes to people there is backgrounds become a welcomed use like a lot of writing podcasting or blogging and speaking all those things are community efforts so that's where I excel um I also one aim a website and select channel you find it on Twitter edge J bar de vie mentoring and that's a judoka Turing website so please join there a lot of mentors on select I'll be looking for people to help out and so the what knowledge we had really interesting I'm really interested in eight and you are just really find it very exciting a friend they I went to their house and they had set it up in their house and I spent two hours plan is free of your system and by the time I was done I was four ounce with but I've had so much fun so I'm really interested in seeing how that technology is that advanced where it will be less about the gear and more accessible to other people how are you using it in just in everyday life it will be very interesting to how they I and a mini reality I mean a are augmented reality and virtual reality are going to be used in just everyday lives and so the one thing I would tell newbies one of the pieces of Isis that's become is all time is about mentoring so everybody to become creative reading it's virtually impossible for most people who come to you they're very live without on the mentor just for the simple fact that this is like the Wild West there is no there is no defined path winners if you want to be a doctor there's a divine path if you want to be a dentist there's a defined path if you want to be educated in SIA pet if you want to be a developer you go taxi garbage gets to me and wake up today dislike one of your developer and can learn everything you need to learn to be a developer so there's no more fun iPad and without somebody more similar to help guy what you're doing you often find yourself and you've down this rabbit holes or feeling really discouraged and so mentors really help but I'll give you some advice on how to get an intern mentoring it's all the mouth relationships so if one image don't go to some lesson hey I need a mentor this is what I want to learn that's not how that works oh you want somebody who's going to invest in you and your success and that only happens in the care that they care about you know where they're going to care about you is if they have a relationship with you so five ways to volunteer in your community a lot of ways to ask my ways to ask how can I help for you ask them to help you and what happens is you'll find that they'll go to you they'll see this or asking you hey what are you working on how can I help and then it becomes like them you're advocating that's what you want they want your first job to come from your network you don't want to get your first job because it was posted on the website you want to be there so badly about you before they of a full set job you want to be the candidate before their jobs even post it so the best way to do that is to build your relationships and get you over time thank you all right so hopefully that was helpful to some of you I know I am I think a mentor would be really helpful I didn't really have I kind of had a mentor uh but it was more in like in general like digital marketing so search engine optimization and SUV by copywriting and things so I never really had like a programmer mentor and even now I you know I already have a fulltime job doing this I can still see the value and having a mentor and I've been able to be somewhat of a mentor to to some some of the students here who are interested in programming and it's it's awesome I mean you know I can see whenever I help people out make it they get through things a lot faster than I get through things because I can point them to a resource that I know is good I know the problems that they'll probably run into before they do so whereas it would take me a long time and I would work through some resources that weren't very helpful before I found the right ones you know if if you're mentoring someone you can help them get through that faster or if you're seeking out a mentor they can help you get through that faster so you just don't waste your time going down deadend paths people that have been doing this for longer have a much better idea of of the big picture and I can can direct you to where you need to go and what you need to learn so good advice from from Kim and I don't see all right we don't have any other questions in the live chat so I'm going to get to work tomorrow we're going to launch this site so the video that might already be launched by the time I do the video tomorrow I'm hoping it is maybe I'll have to just stay up late tonight and tomorrow and get it launched tomorrow night but hopefully it'll be ready enough to launch thanks for all your help I know you all put in some some really good advice too you know I asked a lot of questions of you this time around and I really really appreciate that hopefully when I do these live streams we can learn from each other and your projects will get better and so will mine thanks so much for watching and I'll be back tomorrow
