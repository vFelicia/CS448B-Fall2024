With timestamps:

00:04 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with jesse i'm jesse and today
00:10 - i'm probably not going to accomplish
00:12 - what i've set out to accomplish because
00:14 - i don't even know if this is gonna work
00:16 - i've never done it before
00:18 - i've never even heard of anybody doing
00:20 - it before and i haven't found an example
00:22 - of someone else doing it
00:24 - so
00:25 - i look at today as an adventure
00:27 - as we're gonna try some stuff out i'm
00:29 - going to do my best to explain and make
00:31 - this even if we fail i'm going to try to
00:33 - make it you know somewhat useful to you
00:35 - all in terms of
00:37 - you know some of the stuff that we do
00:39 - hopefully will be
00:40 - uh applicable to
00:42 - to your work i'm probably only going to
00:44 - do one pomodoro session of code today
00:48 - because i have um a meeting and i got to
00:51 - get some some data ready for my meeting
00:53 - so i want to make sure i can answer all
00:55 - your questions so maybe i'll do one
00:57 - pomodoro session and then we'll spend
00:58 - the rest of the time answering questions
01:00 - and that should give me enough time to
01:02 - answer everything
01:03 - uh so
01:04 - we'll see how much code we can actually
01:06 - squeeze in
01:08 - i have a lot of comments already in the
01:11 - chat which is awesome so let me just
01:14 - take maybe just a minute no longer just
01:17 - to say hi and
01:19 - welcome any any new people right so
01:22 - looks like
01:23 - hey max i'm not gonna read all the
01:25 - hellos out i'm just gonna just gonna
01:27 - check uh i do read all of these so i'm
01:30 - not missing anybody but there's a lot so
01:32 - i'm gonna
01:33 - skip over a bit here
01:36 - all right
01:38 - awesome
01:42 - okay cool uh i did have somebody ask how
01:44 - i am
01:45 - uh
01:46 - so
01:47 - i'm doing uh pretty pretty well uh if
01:50 - you've been with with the stream for a
01:52 - while you know i'm still recovering from
01:54 - wrist surgery my wrist actually hurts a
01:56 - lot today so it's not that bad that i
01:58 - think it'll really affect my my typing
02:02 - so i think we'll be fine
02:04 - and
02:05 - this may end up being my only stream
02:07 - this week because i'm gonna go to the
02:09 - react rally conference in salt lake city
02:11 - and then i'm gonna go straight from
02:13 - there to uh to new york city to go to
02:16 - the um free code camp top contributor
02:19 - uh event uh that they're having out
02:22 - there so if anybody is in any of those
02:24 - areas and you know wants to hang out or
02:25 - something please let me know
02:27 - um but i'll try to um like give updates
02:30 - of what's going on on on instagram and
02:32 - twitter and stuff so i'm not sure if i
02:35 - can get a live stream in or anything
02:37 - when i'm there depends on the internet
02:38 - but if you
02:40 - if you follow me on those social media
02:43 - platforms uh then at least i'll be
02:46 - um
02:47 - i'll still be around you if you have any
02:49 - questions feel free to reach out to me
02:53 - okay
02:56 - okay
02:57 - looks like i'm getting
03:02 - all right what's going on here
03:04 - somebody says check the voice
03:07 - can everybody hear me
03:09 - my mic is showing that it's it's working
03:12 - or my uh my obs screen is showing it's
03:14 - working
03:15 - let me know
03:17 - also someone saying about the videos
03:19 - loading
03:20 - okay so i'm not sure what's up with that
03:22 - let me know if y'all can hear me and can
03:24 - see me
03:25 - uh i'm gonna go into the code now
03:28 - um so i see there's a lot of questions
03:30 - in there after i do some code for about
03:32 - 25 minutes i'm gonna come back and
03:33 - answer all your questions okay so uh
03:35 - just hang in there
03:38 - let's switch over so you can see the
03:39 - screen okay so here's some of the code
03:43 - i have uh made some updates
03:46 - and i'll explain more we're kind of
03:48 - going in a different direction with the
03:50 - home page layout so
03:52 - i can explain that later on if you want
03:56 - uh and you can also check out what i've
03:57 - done if you look at the commit log on
03:59 - the github repo the
04:01 - um
04:02 - the link to that's in the description to
04:04 - this video
04:06 - okay so today we'll mostly be working in
04:08 - this server.js file
04:12 - because we're gonna be dealing with uh
04:16 - the
04:17 - salesforce api so i'm gonna bring over
04:19 - some stuff onto the screen
04:21 - let me start my pomodoro timer
04:24 - okay i'm gonna pull over some of the
04:26 - stuff that i've been looking at
04:29 - so y'all can check it out and i will
04:30 - paste the links into
04:33 - the uh
04:34 - the live chat as well so i came across
04:37 - this
04:40 - uh on github
04:45 - and
04:48 - this repo i know you'll probably can't
04:50 - see it i'm gonna zoom in here actually
04:53 - let me
04:56 - put these together and
04:57 - make them a lot bigger here so it's
04:59 - easier for everybody to see
05:01 - okay so i came across across this repo
05:04 - it looks like a really old repo but it
05:05 - has been updated
05:07 - recently a lot of the files have been
05:09 - updated so
05:11 - i'm assuming that it it still works
05:14 - we'll find out
05:15 - uh but this is
05:17 - gonna allow us to more easily connect to
05:21 - uh the salesforce api okay
05:27 - so here's the documentation for that
05:32 - and right now i'm looking at
05:34 - how to
05:36 - connect right and so let's go back to
05:39 - our getting started because we're gonna
05:41 - start right right at the beginning okay
05:43 - we can install this right you know just
05:45 - with uh npm
05:47 - uh we're gonna use yarn because we've
05:48 - been been using yarn
05:52 - and i'll need to
05:55 - i'll need to do a little bit on another
05:56 - screen because i need to put in my
05:57 - credentials so
05:59 - um
06:00 - that's about the only thing you won't be
06:02 - able to see everything else i'll try to
06:03 - do here
06:06 - all right so first let's install js
06:08 - force
06:10 - and
06:11 - my goal now in this session is just to
06:14 - get a connection see if we can connect
06:18 - where's our codes
06:21 - whoops
06:22 - all right let's pull this over
06:24 - okay
06:26 - so
06:27 - i'm gonna do a yarn let me make this
06:29 - bigger
06:30 - i'll go one more size
06:32 - larger here all right so here's my
06:35 - terminal i'm going to say yarn
06:37 - um
06:39 - you know what let's do this on a
06:40 - separate branch because i don't want to
06:42 - mess anything up in the server file so
06:43 - let's create a let's do git
06:46 - checkout
06:51 - and we're going to do put a b flag on
06:53 - there
06:54 - and then we're going to say we're going
06:56 - to call this um let's say
07:00 - we'll call it salesforce okay so i like
07:02 - to do uh get checkout with a b flag
07:05 - because if i try to do a
07:07 - uh get branch create the branch and then
07:09 - check out i often forget to actually
07:12 - check out the branch so we're gonna do
07:14 - this in a branch if you're using git to
07:17 - do version control if you're going to
07:18 - put a new feature in especially if it's
07:21 - either like a major feature or you think
07:23 - you might be like break something uh
07:26 - while you're doing it you generally want
07:28 - to do it on a separate branch
07:30 - if you're committing to someone else's
07:32 - project you for sure want to do it on
07:34 - another branch
07:36 - so this will allow us to
07:39 - feel free to break things do anything we
07:41 - want and we can always switch back to
07:43 - the master branch
07:45 - and make updates and push that up to in
07:48 - this case the site's not live yet but we
07:50 - do have a development site that's that's
07:52 - out there
07:53 - so i definitely recommend doing that
07:56 - so now that we have it on this branch
07:59 - now we can do a yarn
08:01 - uh add js force
08:05 - i'm gonna double check that name
08:07 - js force yep that's it
08:15 - all right so that shouldn't take too
08:17 - long
08:19 - and while that's going we can see
08:22 - how we're going to
08:25 - bring this in
08:28 - so there is a way to do this in browser
08:29 - but i'm not going to do that we have
08:31 - node running we're going to use node
08:32 - we're going to send data from
08:34 - from the back end
08:37 - the goal of this is to
08:39 - be able to send data straight from our
08:42 - react application from a form on our
08:44 - react application straight into
08:45 - salesforce right now
08:48 - we are sending people prospective
08:51 - students if they want to
08:53 - inquire about to get more information
08:55 - about our university they have to click
08:57 - a link they're directed to another site
08:59 - that has a form on it
09:01 - it would be a lot more convenient if
09:04 - they never had to leave our site or even
09:06 - click away from a page if we just had
09:08 - the
09:09 - form
09:11 - right there on the home page as you
09:13 - scroll down you'll eventually see it and
09:15 - you could put in some info
09:18 - i think we'll get a much
09:19 - higher conversion rate let's say on our
09:22 - on our inquiry form
09:25 - okay
09:26 - all right great that's there that's
09:28 - that's in there now
09:30 - um
09:31 - so let me make some space here for our
09:34 - server.js our server.js file is is quite
09:37 - crowded right now so eventually if we
09:39 - get this to work we'll probably move it
09:41 - to its own separate file but for now i'm
09:43 - just going to do it here
09:44 - uh just to save some time
09:47 - okay
09:49 - so let's copy
09:52 - some of this stuff
09:55 - and paste it up here
09:59 - and i'm going to change these vars to
10:01 - const
10:03 - okay generally
10:06 - when you're using es6 right or they call
10:09 - es 2015 it's a newer version of
10:12 - javascript some some additions to it
10:17 - when you're using that you want to
10:20 - use const or let
10:23 - in place of vare if you're not sure why
10:26 - and you want to know you can ask me
10:27 - after
10:28 - this pomodoro sessions over i'll be
10:29 - happy to explain like why you would use
10:31 - one or the other
10:33 - but there's really no need to use there
10:35 - anymore
10:38 - okay could not find
10:40 - declaration for our module for js force
10:43 - hmm
10:47 - let's double check and make sure that
10:48 - this works
10:51 - i thought it did
10:52 - oh
10:53 - maybe it didn't
11:00 - okay let's see
11:15 - um
11:30 - all right got a lot of stuff not working
11:32 - here
11:53 - hmm
12:05 - maybe this isn't going to work
12:09 - let's check the uh the github repo again
12:12 - and we'll go to issues
12:14 - and see what's happening 195 issues is
12:16 - actually a lot maybe this is not really
12:18 - being maintained anymore
12:26 - okay
12:28 - i mean based on the issues that people
12:31 - are are
12:32 - posting here they've obviously got it to
12:35 - to install
12:39 - okay
12:40 - let's go back here i wonder if you have
12:43 - to have a certain version of node so i'm
12:45 - going to double check i don't remember
12:47 - seeing anything about that
12:56 - okay let's check releases
12:58 - see if there's any info there
13:01 - all right
13:04 - i'm alright they just came out with a
13:05 - new release 19 days ago
13:27 - all right let's
13:32 - i'm just going to run yarn again
13:34 - all right everything's up to date that's
13:37 - weird
13:38 - why can't we find js force
13:42 - i don't really want to open up my node
13:44 - modules
13:45 - um
13:48 - just gonna run this one more time
13:51 - it probably won't work but you never
13:52 - know like it does happen that you just
13:55 - try the same thing again and and now it
13:57 - works so
13:58 - um
14:00 - we'll give it another go
14:03 - okay didn't get all these
14:08 - i did not get all these errors this time
14:10 - and
14:11 - hmm
14:29 - all right
14:32 - i'm just gonna let that go
14:33 - for now
14:36 - because i don't think it's gonna matter
14:42 - so let's move on then
14:46 - it's good to know that that they have
14:48 - had a recent release though
14:50 - i do want to check my time all right
14:52 - about 15 minutes
14:57 - okay now that we've gone through the
14:58 - installation let's go to
15:01 - document let's go here
15:03 - and
15:05 - look at how we connect
15:08 - so
15:09 - i'm just gonna copy and paste
15:13 - this
15:14 - this part this seems like it's the
15:16 - simplest way to connect
15:19 - so we'll try this first
15:21 - there's a lot of other stuff about ways
15:23 - to connect
15:25 - not worried about it right now
15:32 - okay
15:34 - so
15:35 - we definitely need
15:41 - okay so it looks like all we need to put
15:43 - in here
15:55 - yeah all we need to put in here is a
15:56 - login url a username and a password
16:02 - okay cool so
16:04 - i can just put the login url right in
16:06 - here and that's not going to be a
16:08 - problem uh the username and password i'm
16:10 - going to save is environment variables
16:12 - and then pull them in and so i don't
16:14 - show my uh my password to everybody
16:18 - okay
16:19 - so
16:21 - first things first uh and this would be
16:23 - easy
16:24 - what is this extra speak
16:26 - uh let's get that that login url so
16:30 - here's salesforce
16:35 - let's see tesla says what should i call
16:37 - all right
16:41 - i'm not even sure where
16:43 - let's see where this is log out
16:45 - this should take me yep there we are
16:48 - um
16:51 - so
16:52 - i believe this would be
16:55 - the login url
16:57 - and then
16:59 - for username and password i am going to
17:02 - open up
17:04 - the
17:07 - environment variable file
17:09 - on another
17:14 - on another screen
17:16 - so
17:17 - i'm gonna pull this over to my other
17:19 - screen
17:20 - and
17:23 - okay
17:26 - it'll just take me a second to navigate
17:28 - there
17:33 - hmm
17:55 - it's not let me open this
17:56 - uh let's see
18:10 - all right i wonder if i can
18:18 - do i not have
18:21 - a dot m
18:25 - that's so weird
18:34 - i thought i had one
18:49 - that's so weird
18:54 - okay then i guess i will
18:58 - try to make one
19:17 - okay hold on a second
19:20 - for some reason visual studio code does
19:22 - not want to let me open this project
19:23 - twice
19:38 - all right
19:42 - let's
19:49 - just make an m-file and i will drag it
19:52 - over to my other window there we are
19:55 - okay
20:00 - now we'll go back here
20:01 - close this here
20:03 - and
20:04 - i'll say
20:14 - okay
20:16 - so
20:18 - on my other screen i'm gonna go to
20:21 - lastpass and find my username and
20:24 - password
20:32 - and my username
20:47 - okay
21:03 - all right and i should be able to bring
21:05 - these in in the same way that that these
21:08 - are being brought in so let's just copy
21:10 - this
21:11 - save a little bit of time here
21:13 - um
21:17 - and
21:21 - let's make this
21:23 - username
21:26 - and
21:27 - i call this uh
21:31 - username
21:35 - and then
21:37 - we'll copy
21:38 - and paste this and change it to
21:40 - [Music]
21:42 - password
21:48 - okay
21:55 - all right so let's see who we're doing
22:01 - all right so what we're looking for
22:03 - hopefully is that we will get
22:05 - some
22:06 - stuff logged to the console
22:17 - okay
22:19 - uh also
22:22 - we should probably check
22:24 - to make sure we haven't crashed anything
22:30 - so
22:32 - all right it looks like nothing is
22:33 - crashed on the side so that's good
22:36 - uh we can check
22:49 - okay
22:51 - oh
22:51 - [Music]
22:53 - you know what let's
22:56 - let's quit that and let's do a um
23:02 - yarn
23:04 - oops let's say
23:07 - sorry
23:08 - i gotta check out
23:11 - actu let's just run this like this let's
23:13 - do node
23:16 - server yes
23:22 - okay
23:41 - all right we're not getting anything
23:42 - in our console
23:58 - you know what let's check our
23:59 - documentation this
24:02 - is
24:12 - all right about five more minutes i'll
24:13 - get your questions so i see there's a
24:15 - ton of stuff in the live chat so uh i'm
24:18 - i'm gonna get to everything
24:26 - all right well let's see
24:28 - let's
24:29 - assume that we've made some sort of
24:31 - connection
24:32 - and let's go down and see if we can make
24:35 - a query now
24:46 - let's see
24:55 - hmm
25:12 - this is
25:30 - trying to find one that would work with
25:32 - what data we have
25:49 - i also don't want to get any data that i
25:51 - should not be showing on youtube
25:59 - oh how about let's just try to create
26:01 - something
26:02 - and then i don't have to actually show
26:04 - anything
26:05 - um
26:14 - all right
26:15 - let's try this
26:29 - i'm not sure if i'd need to put this
26:32 - inside of here or not
26:36 - we'll try it inside first
26:46 - all right yeah let's just show this as
26:47 - is
26:48 - why is it saying this
26:52 - oh indentation
26:56 - okay
27:04 - i do i want to see
27:17 - let me make sure
27:18 - i'm just going to go through kind of
27:20 - each step just to make sure things are
27:22 - getting picked up correctly
27:35 - oh you know what i'm not
27:38 - automatically restarting the server now
27:40 - since i i just did this okay
27:43 - all right so we're getting
27:45 - undefined here
27:48 - and now we're getting invalid using
27:50 - password security token okay
27:53 - all right that makes sense
27:56 - why it's not working
27:59 - all right so what's up with this then
28:19 - i don't know what i did
28:24 - all right you know what let me
28:32 - let me move this over to my other screen
28:37 - just quickly and i'm gonna
28:42 - i'm gonna hard code those values
28:44 - directly into the file
28:49 - i need to do it on my other screen
28:50 - obviously because i can't have anybody
28:52 - seeing that
28:58 - but i just want to make sure
29:00 - you know what the the real problem is
29:02 - here
29:05 - i mean if we've done all the salesforce
29:07 - stuff correctly
29:08 - and it's just something weird going on
29:10 - with the dot m file then i i want to
29:13 - know
29:14 - so i don't spend my time trying to
29:16 - troubleshoot the wrong thing
29:18 - so my 25 minute timer just ended so this
29:21 - would be the last thing that i try
29:28 - okay
29:37 - i'm going to save that
29:40 - and
29:46 - let's restart the server
29:50 - see what happened
29:56 - oh user must use security token
30:03 - okay
30:16 - all right
30:18 - so i need to
30:20 - get a security token
30:24 - from salesforce
30:26 - and then use add that to my password
30:31 - okay
30:32 - what do you all think let me know should
30:34 - we try that just see if we can get it to
30:36 - work or should i stop now and um
30:39 - go to the questions
31:02 - all right
31:04 - reset my security token
31:09 - oh i sent one to my email address
31:12 - okay
31:14 - so i just reset the security token and
31:17 - they are emailing it to me
31:19 - if it doesn't come in my email like
31:21 - immediately i'll just uh try this a
31:23 - different day oh nice it just got here
31:27 - okay and
31:31 - add it to my password so i'm assuming i
31:33 - can just paste this right at the end of
31:34 - my password
31:36 - so that's what i'm going to do
31:46 - all right we'll give this one more try
31:54 - what
31:56 - i'm pretty sure this just worked
32:03 - so we created these records
32:12 - nice i wonder if i can now search for
32:14 - these records by id
32:18 - um
32:19 - so let me go in i'm logged into
32:21 - salesforce on my other screen
32:23 - i'm gonna see if i can search
32:26 - for a record
32:29 - uh let's see
32:59 - i don't know what they have under
33:00 - normally it's leads
33:02 - um but i'm not sure if they use that
33:07 - that terminology
33:19 - so it obviously it looks like it worked
33:21 - i'm just not entirely sure where
33:27 - where it saved this to
33:29 - so
33:31 - maybe
33:33 - so normally in salesforce you'd use it
33:34 - for a business and then there would be
33:36 - um you would call them leads but we
33:39 - usually
33:40 - do
33:41 - students
33:46 - so i wonder if this got saved as a
33:48 - student
33:55 - so
33:56 - sorry i can't show you all this i don't
33:58 - want to accidentally show you student
33:59 - information
34:01 - so i'm just trying to do my best to
34:02 - describe what what i'm doing on my other
34:04 - screen if i get to a point where i can
34:06 - show you
34:08 - i will definitely do that
34:10 - let me see
34:13 - um
34:15 - let's see if i can
34:17 - search
34:19 - search students
34:22 - um
34:24 - record id
34:31 - yes
34:36 - all right so i don't think it's that
34:48 - so what i'll probably need to do is
34:54 - i'll need to
34:57 - do a little bit more reading to see like
34:59 - where by default does this stuff show up
35:05 - since i'm not seeing it
35:08 - oh wait a second
35:10 - i found it
35:14 - alright cool now i have something i can
35:15 - actually show you let me move this over
35:17 - here
35:23 - okay
35:24 - so check this out
35:26 - so evidently it by default goes to
35:28 - schools and it it made these schools
35:31 - okay so i'll have to figure out how to
35:33 - put it in the right spot ideally we'd
35:35 - want these to go into um
35:38 - students
35:39 - right but
35:41 - this works for now so you could see we
35:43 - gave it the name of my account one and
35:45 - my account two
35:47 - and um
35:48 - so obviously it didn't
35:50 - fill in these things right because
35:52 - um we didn't tell it to fill these in
35:54 - but you can see by the owner alias
35:57 - is it's me uh just the first part of my
36:00 - name j-w-i-g
36:02 - okay
36:03 - so awesome that worked we're able to
36:05 - connect and we could see
36:07 - like here's the the id
36:10 - right
36:12 - i have a server here uh
36:15 - cool
36:17 - really cool
36:19 - all right awesome so now i'm gonna go to
36:24 - i guess i'll just
36:27 - let me switch it up here
36:29 - uh
36:31 - and
36:33 - now i'm gonna go back to the chat i'm
36:35 - gonna start way up at the top and i'm
36:37 - just gonna work my way down here
36:39 - so um
36:42 - i'm going to try to get to all of the
36:44 - questions i think this was definitely a
36:46 - success
36:47 - um in terms of you know we were actually
36:50 - able to add a record
36:53 - that's awesome now it's just a matter of
36:56 - figuring out the details of being able
36:58 - to add it
36:59 - as a student and get the right match up
37:03 - the right values uh so
37:05 - i'm i'm feeling really really happy
37:07 - about that and i can't believe it only
37:09 - took me to me like less than an hour
37:12 - uh
37:14 - for people who have watched this stream
37:16 - before you know this is a rare
37:17 - occurrence that everything goes like how
37:20 - i wanted it to go and quickly
37:23 - okay
37:28 - steven says jesse thanks for looking at
37:30 - the landmark site that floor plan pop-up
37:32 - build was a huge speed boost for us
37:33 - build wise oh awesome
37:35 - yeah that site was amazing uh
37:38 - so
37:40 - it was like reid was really cool i'm
37:42 - really glad you shared it with me
37:44 - uh let's see
37:46 - nikki says uh just dropping by to say hi
37:48 - hey assagor
37:50 - sorry you couldn't stick can't stick
37:52 - around but thanks for dropping by
37:55 - um
37:58 - nagendra asks for an angular project um
38:01 - i don't know angular so i can't really
38:03 - do an angular project but we do have
38:05 - some videos of people doing angular
38:07 - projects i don't think they're live
38:09 - streams but check the the video list for
38:11 - free code camp maybe do a search for
38:13 - angular
38:14 - i know we we've had some people do
38:16 - angular before
38:19 - um
38:20 - let's see
38:23 - somebody asked what i what am i gonna do
38:27 - i'm not gonna answer that because
38:28 - obviously you saw what i was gonna do so
38:31 - um
38:33 - microscope says hi from turkey hey how's
38:36 - it going thanks for watching uh luis
38:38 - says hello from guadalajara mexico
38:41 - uh awesome
38:43 - lovely with people from all over the
38:45 - world john doses bonjour from france
38:54 - otsm says 81 says hello from a noob from
38:58 - colorado
39:00 - how's it going
39:02 - i'm a noob from ohio originally from
39:04 - west virginia
39:10 - let's see
39:11 - m alvey says
39:13 - you're looking awesome superb
39:16 - thank you i appreciate that not sure if
39:18 - you're talking about my code or my face
39:20 - but
39:21 - either way i appreciate it
39:24 - somebody commented on one of my recent
39:26 - videos i think on my last video
39:28 - something like react.js is so ugly
39:30 - and i thought
39:32 - react.js is probably not ugly it's
39:34 - probably just my code right
39:37 - i'm sure there are people out there that
39:38 - can make it look pretty
39:43 - all right
39:44 - uh dash says what about the ujs i don't
39:47 - know vue
39:49 - one it would be cool one day to drive
39:50 - you out but for right now um my projects
39:53 - are done to react
39:56 - and it would have to be a side project
39:57 - like i'm
39:59 - it doesn't make sense for me to do one
40:01 - project and view for work when like
40:03 - everything we're creating is all react
40:05 - so we can reuse components and things so
40:07 - but i'm open to doing a side project
40:09 - with you but it would have to be
40:10 - something really basic because i've
40:12 - never used it before
40:14 - we do have some videos about views so
40:16 - you know again if you go to free code
40:18 - camp videos do a search for for view
40:21 - you know you'll find some some view
40:23 - tutorial videos and things
40:26 - john cortez says i'm new to coding i may
40:29 - not get what you'll be talking about but
40:31 - i'm here to learn as i'm changing my
40:32 - career to become a coder awesome
40:35 - awesome congratulations uh on the on the
40:38 - career change
40:40 - and uh yeah feel free to ask any
40:42 - questions uh if i'm kind of skipping by
40:44 - things too fast just you know ask me i'm
40:46 - more than happy to explain
40:48 - you know anything
40:54 - uh
40:55 - morillo
40:58 - says is it worth it to learn about
41:00 - canvas uh it depends on what you want to
41:02 - do i mean there are some instances where
41:04 - canvas is the right thing to use
41:06 - um
41:08 - but there's a like i personally never
41:10 - use canvas i've never come across a use
41:12 - case where canvas made sense for me to
41:15 - use so
41:16 - and and i've been a developer for like
41:18 - over five years now
41:20 - so i would say
41:22 - don't just learn canvas if you don't
41:24 - have to use it that would be my advice
41:27 - if you come like fig
41:29 - learn what canvas is and what it's good
41:30 - for
41:32 - and then leave it at that so then that
41:34 - way if you ever have a situation where
41:36 - canvas would be good at least you'll
41:37 - know
41:39 - that you should use canvas and then at
41:40 - that point you can learn more about
41:42 - canvas
41:43 - i mean if you have a lot of free time
41:44 - and you really just want to learn canvas
41:46 - you know go ahead but i don't think it's
41:49 - it's necessary
42:03 - all right john cortez says is coding
42:04 - boot camp worth it uh it can be
42:08 - it
42:09 - so it kind of depends on what kind of
42:10 - learner you are
42:13 - for me
42:15 - i just i was always working and learning
42:17 - at the same time i never had a period of
42:20 - time where i could dedicate all my time
42:22 - to a coding bootcamp
42:23 - uh so i when i started when i shifted my
42:26 - career into being a developer i already
42:28 - had a wife and kids and
42:31 - a mortgage payment and i so i couldn't
42:35 - full time like learn i just learned what
42:37 - i needed to do to get the job done for
42:39 - my clients
42:41 - so
42:41 - a boot camp was kind of out of the
42:43 - question for me
42:44 - at least like an intense boot camp so i
42:46 - did more like online courses a lot of
42:48 - free stuff
42:50 - a lot of just learning on my own
42:53 - but some people
42:54 - they thrive in that boot camp setting
42:56 - and they learn a lot quickly
42:58 - so you have to know yourself there also
43:00 - not all boot camps are the same some
43:02 - boot camps aren't really that good so
43:04 - you gotta you know do your research
43:07 - and
43:08 - you know figure out like do you have the
43:10 - time for the boot camp the money for the
43:12 - boot camp is that your learning style
43:14 - and then is that particular boot camp
43:16 - good
43:17 - so it's not really a question that i
43:19 - could i could answer in general you know
43:28 - okay
43:31 - uh
43:32 - ash
43:33 - axe says sorry i misprint might be
43:35 - mispronouncing that uh it says teach us
43:37 - how to code using mobile please we did
43:40 - do some streams using react native to
43:43 - code things for android and ios i'd love
43:46 - to get back to that at some point i just
43:48 - need to get this project launched
43:51 - i'm going to be honest with you this is
43:52 - going to be
43:53 - even once we launch this it's not going
43:55 - to be finished you know there's always
43:56 - going to be more things to do and to
43:58 - update
43:59 - but
44:01 - i would love to shift it so that our
44:04 - main project moves to something else for
44:06 - this stream
44:07 - potentially maybe a react native project
44:10 - um and then i do a lot of the work for
44:12 - this project right now kind of off the
44:15 - stream
44:16 - and i only come back to it when we're
44:18 - gonna add like some cool feature that i
44:20 - think you all be interested in
44:29 - um mlv says how much do you code in 24
44:33 - hours
44:34 - oh it just depends
44:38 - it depends on the 24 hours
44:41 - so um
44:42 - there have been times when i've i've
44:44 - worked for like 14 hours uh
44:48 - like
44:49 - if i have to launch a project and
44:51 - there's a lot of stuff to do
44:53 - sometimes it's
44:55 - i've coded for that long before
44:57 - uh that's pretty extreme
44:59 - um
45:01 - and obviously there are some 24-hour
45:03 - periods where i don't code at all
45:06 - but
45:08 - trying to get an average
45:12 - i don't know maybe like an average would
45:14 - be
45:15 - like five hours a day or something i
45:17 - don't know because i don't spend all day
45:18 - coding um
45:19 - i answer emails i do paperwork i go to
45:21 - meetings
45:24 - so it's it kind of depends
45:33 - um mlv asked about the github dark theme
45:35 - yeah if you just type in github dark uh
45:38 - theme on google it'll be the first thing
45:40 - that'll come up just follow the
45:41 - instructions and um
45:44 - yeah it's not it's not difficult
45:46 - i think there's several options for
45:48 - getting it to work too
45:50 - also asks uh we want we wanted to know
45:53 - more about yourself
45:55 - um let me know what specifically do you
45:57 - want to know
45:58 - i mean i can tell you a lot about myself
46:00 - but i if there's anything in particular
46:02 - let me know
46:04 - um
46:05 - and then i'll i'll answer that once i
46:06 - get down to the bottom there
46:09 - um
46:10 - ma'am alvey says what's your skills
46:12 - front end or back end
46:16 - so
46:17 - my title is front end developer but
46:19 - realistically i'm more like full stack
46:22 - now
46:23 - to be honest i say i probably do more
46:25 - front end than back end
46:27 - but we don't have somebody that's a back
46:30 - end so
46:31 - like node stuff is back-end stuff right
46:36 - i do that
46:37 - i set up
46:38 - servers right i set up linux servers i
46:41 - do the maintenance on those servers i
46:42 - set up databases right so
46:46 - all that stuff i i do as well so i'm
46:49 - definitely not purely front end
46:52 - it just worked out that that's the title
46:54 - that that i had uh because at
46:57 - you know at the time it was i was mostly
47:00 - doing front end stuff so alright let's
47:01 - just you know let's go with front end
47:16 - um
47:17 - john cortez asked about my application
47:19 - for coding and i was using visual studio
47:23 - code
47:37 - um mlb says does anyone have a slack
47:39 - workspace for coding help
47:41 - um
47:43 - i don't know
47:44 - do we have a slack channel
47:47 - i'm not sure we've had some channels
47:49 - like
47:50 - chat chat room things
47:53 - and um but i'm not they're not really
47:56 - that active but if anybody knows of some
47:58 - sort of like slack channel for coding
48:00 - help you know uh please let
48:03 - uh m alvi uh no
48:24 - let's see
48:25 - um john cortez says
48:28 - is what jesse is doing now something
48:30 - that can be learned within that
48:31 - three-month boot camp um
48:34 - maybe
48:35 - i it depends so michael had a good
48:37 - answer says if you're starting from zero
48:39 - javascript knowledge it might take a
48:40 - while to build up if you have knowledge
48:42 - in javascript um you should be able to
48:44 - pick it up yeah i i totally agree with
48:46 - that answer
48:47 - um
48:49 - yeah if you're starting from zero
48:51 - it's gonna be hard to get here
48:55 - in in three months
48:57 - um i'm not saying what i'm doing is
48:59 - spectacular or anything but
49:01 - it just it takes time you know to get to
49:03 - there
49:04 - uh so
49:06 - yeah but if you're already good with
49:07 - javascript and it's just a matter of
49:09 - learning how to do things with react
49:11 - yeah three months is definitely
49:12 - reasonable
49:14 - and it's hard to say sometimes it
49:15 - depends on the person you know if you're
49:17 - like a genius
49:18 - who knows what you could do
49:35 - uh so john says should i uh john cortez
49:38 - says should i concentrate on learning
49:40 - html and javascript yeah for sure um if
49:44 - yeah start out if you go to the free
49:46 - code camp curriculum so if you go to
49:48 - freecodecamp.org and you start the
49:50 - curriculum that's a good place to start
49:52 - go through it'll teach you about html
49:55 - css and then it'll get you into
49:56 - javascript and it will ease you in you
49:59 - know so you you get
50:01 - you know that knowledge builds and then
50:03 - you work your way up
50:05 - into more difficult things you'll learn
50:07 - a little react
50:08 - so
50:09 - that's kind of a good path to go and
50:11 - then you can supplement your learning
50:13 - with with other materials
50:27 - um michael said this seems like it
50:30 - should be factored out
50:32 - yeah yeah for sure i think it should be
50:34 - too
50:50 - all right m4t says what is that program
50:52 - that you use i'm assuming you're talking
50:54 - about visual studio code
51:06 - okay
51:18 - all right
51:22 - michael asked what's the graphic on my
51:23 - mug okay so here's my my mug so this is
51:27 - uh it says fatherhood the best job
51:30 - uh you'll ever love
51:32 - okay so and then
51:34 - on the back here it has um
51:37 - st joseph uh holding baby jesus and mary
51:41 - uh taking a nap in the background so
51:44 - i don't remember who got me this mug but
51:46 - i work at a a catholic university so
51:48 - it's definitely appropriate
51:53 - i think i got this like when i first
51:55 - became a father so my oldest is nine
51:57 - years old so i've had it
52:00 - for a while here
52:02 - but in case you don't know i have four
52:04 - children
52:09 - uh
52:11 - jai
52:12 - jainam
52:13 - it's j-a-i-n-a-m please let me know if
52:16 - i'm pronouncing that wrong i i want to
52:17 - get it right but anyway it says what is
52:19 - the salesforce api uh salesforce api is
52:22 - just a way to get data from salesforce
52:25 - and put data into salesforce by making
52:28 - um
52:30 - well api calls right so you make like an
52:32 - http request and
52:34 - you can
52:35 - use the uh the api
52:40 - let me know if i need to explain that a
52:42 - little bit more so it may not
52:44 - depending on your level of understanding
52:46 - right now i may need to explain a little
52:47 - bit more so i'm happy to do that if you
52:49 - need me to
52:52 - kendo says hello from japan hey how's it
52:54 - going
52:55 - you know i i rarely get viewers from
52:57 - japan so that's really awesome thanks
52:59 - for letting me know
53:04 - um
53:07 - says what is codeigniter framework
53:09 - developer uh codeigniter is
53:14 - i believe codeigniter is php
53:19 - i think it's a php
53:21 - uh like framework or something so i from
53:25 - what i understand it's it's kind of old
53:29 - but i i haven't used it i a colleague of
53:32 - mine has used it before and that's the
53:33 - only
53:34 - i just remember him talking about it
53:45 - uh
53:47 - ivan says hi can you show how to hide
53:49 - and show content text in html with
53:52 - buttons thanks in advance uh congrats
53:55 - from
53:56 - uh bulgaria well hi and welcome um if
54:00 - you want to show and hide uh text in
54:03 - html with buttons uh you could
54:07 - it depends on what you want to do right
54:09 - you could use just overall like you
54:11 - would want to use javascript to
54:14 - tell when that button gets clicked and
54:16 - then when that button gets clicked
54:18 - uh you could
54:20 - change the css of that button to use um
54:24 - you know to show or hide so it would be
54:26 - like
54:26 - um display none or display block you
54:30 - could toggle that
54:32 - uh if you were using
54:34 - and you could use jquery for that you
54:36 - could use vanilla javascript if you were
54:37 - using react you would want to change the
54:40 - state
54:41 - uh on a button click um
54:44 - and then you could just render it based
54:46 - on
54:47 - like uh if
54:49 - the state for this equals true
54:52 - render it otherwise don't render it
54:53 - right so there's there's different ways
54:55 - you could do it it kind of depends on
54:57 - what
54:58 - what you want to use
55:01 - so i mean that's kind of a big overview
55:02 - for that
55:03 - uh if you want to know like specifically
55:05 - what code you would type
55:07 - um
55:08 - you know your best bet is probably like
55:10 - just doing check and stack overflow or
55:12 - something
55:13 - uh because it it does kind of depend on
55:15 - what you want to use
55:19 - stephen says every feature you do is
55:21 - cool hashtag hype
55:23 - thank you
55:23 - i appreciate that
55:25 - um
55:27 - bogdan says hi can i become in six
55:30 - months a junior developer
55:32 - oh yeah for sure i mean obviously it
55:34 - depends on how much you know now and uh
55:37 - you know how quickly you can learn
55:38 - things but i think it's definitely
55:40 - possible in six months
55:43 - michael says i didn't realize you set up
55:44 - servers too uh you really need to get a
55:46 - title change yeah
55:48 - yeah
55:50 - i guess i should it hasn't
55:53 - i don't even remember when i got this
55:54 - title to be honest with you so maybe it
55:56 - has been a while maybe i should try to
55:57 - get a change
55:59 - we'll
56:00 - see maybe i'll wait until they give me
56:03 - like employees that to work under me and
56:06 - then i'll then i'll go for the title
56:07 - chains
56:12 - uh microscope says i know how to learn
56:14 - programming but i don't know what to do
56:18 - i need an idea also i'm too used to
56:21 - visual studio code
56:23 - this program
56:25 - perfect in atom or sublime
56:30 - i'm not sure what you're asking uh
56:33 - you're saying you don't know what to do
56:34 - you need an idea so are you saying you
56:36 - you don't really have an idea of what to
56:38 - build or what's it what to make
56:42 - uh if you just google like app ideas
56:44 - there are websites out there that give
56:45 - you a ton of like ideas of things to
56:48 - build
56:49 - so those will give you some ideas um
56:51 - also i i do like visual studio code i
56:53 - never use sublime i did use adam and i
56:56 - switched to visual studio code i think
56:58 - visual studio code is a bit faster than
57:00 - that atom but atom is still good i
57:03 - i used it for years so i think either
57:06 - one would be a good choice i just i
57:08 - happen to prefer visual studio code at
57:10 - the moment
57:14 - oh michael has confirmed that cody
57:16 - knighter is php based
57:25 - okay so ivan says uh yes to to do the
57:28 - show hide thing in javascript
57:30 - um
57:32 - yeah
57:34 - if you wanted to
57:35 - [Music]
57:36 - do it in just plain vanilla javascript
57:38 - you have no jquery no react anything
57:40 - like that um then
57:43 - you're gonna be using
57:45 - um
57:49 - i mean i guess off the top of my head
57:51 - like you're gonna be selecting elements
57:52 - with document.getelementbyid
57:55 - you want to grab the ids
57:57 - and then
57:59 - say what the click is
58:01 - so you would need to get
58:03 - like a click handler right
58:05 - uh if i'm assuming you click the buttons
58:08 - and then
58:10 - like depending i think
58:14 - i can't remember what is
58:16 - vanilla javascript way for changing
58:20 - css
58:21 - but that's how
58:24 - that's how you would do it you would use
58:25 - javascript to change the css
58:28 - i mean potentially you could completely
58:29 - add or remove those elements from the
58:32 - page but i don't know that i would go to
58:33 - all that i would
58:35 - i would probably just
58:37 - use display
58:39 - display none or like michael says you
58:42 - could do visibility hidden too if you
58:44 - want
58:45 - that would also work
58:47 - the only thing about visibility hidden
58:49 - is if your your text takes up space and
58:52 - you do visibility hidden like that space
58:54 - will still be there
58:56 - uh you just won't see the text if you
58:58 - don't want that space there then you
59:00 - want to do display none because it'll
59:01 - totally
59:02 - you know take away any space that it'll
59:04 - take up
59:05 - correct me if i'm wrong about that but i
59:06 - i believe that's that's how that
59:08 - functions
59:11 - um
59:12 - gia says is this project nearly finished
59:15 - how do you think how long do you think
59:17 - it's going to take
59:18 - i hope we're nearly finished i mean
59:20 - we're very very close to being able to
59:22 - launch
59:23 - i'm talking like within a matter of
59:25 - weeks we can we can launch for sure
59:27 - maybe
59:28 - maybe sooner i mean i
59:30 - i just have other stuff going on that i
59:32 - can't launch it so
59:34 - if i had all my time to dedicate to it
59:36 - we could probably have a launch next
59:37 - week but i i don't
59:39 - um
59:41 - yeah so i mean in terms of launch
59:44 - pretty soon
59:45 - in terms of finished i'm it's never
59:47 - going to be finished this is going to be
59:49 - the thing that i'm constantly working on
59:51 - and updating
59:52 - uh so
59:54 - you know this is just like this project
59:56 - is basically going to be a big part of
59:58 - my job now from here on out i'm
60:00 - constantly going to be updating it
60:06 - uh kendo says what are you using for seo
60:08 - for react should i be using something
60:10 - like next.js yeah if you need to worry
60:13 - about seo which is search engine
60:14 - optimization i definitely recommend
60:16 - using
60:17 - something like next js it doesn't have
60:20 - to be you just need to server side
60:22 - render
60:23 - your code
60:24 - otherwise search engines
60:26 - are not going to be able to pick up any
60:28 - of the the stuff that you're trying to
60:30 - pull in from an api
60:32 - so um
60:34 - the api calls usually take too long if
60:36 - you're trying to do a client side
60:38 - and the search engines won't stick
60:39 - around long enough to actually see that
60:42 - that data come in so you you want a
60:44 - server side render so that when someone
60:46 - first goes to your site they get just
60:49 - regular html all the contents there and
60:52 - then when they start clicking around in
60:54 - its client-side routing happening then
60:57 - you know that's cool you can you can do
60:59 - stuff on client side uh so i personally
61:02 - i like doing both it's kind of like best
61:04 - of both worlds you get that speed of
61:06 - client-side routing you know but you
61:08 - also get that really quick initial load
61:11 - that's uh search engine friendly so next
61:14 - js takes care of a lot of the the
61:16 - background stuff of making that happen
61:18 - for you so i do
61:20 - i do like using uh next.js for that
61:31 - michael says how do you get free code
61:32 - cam projects on github
61:34 - you just have to you know make a github
61:36 - account and
61:39 - create a new repo
61:42 - and then do your your project so i'm not
61:44 - sure
61:45 - how familiar you are with git and github
61:50 - so you might need to maybe do a course
61:51 - or read up on that first
61:57 - sorry
61:58 - i think yawn i always yawned during the
62:00 - streams
62:01 - today hasn't been too bad i've been
62:03 - fighting holding back of the yawns
62:06 - um
62:07 - tushar says can you
62:10 - recommend some projects for intermediate
62:13 - programmers in php
62:15 - um
62:16 - i
62:17 - i don't really know
62:19 - i would recommend again like um just
62:22 - googling project ideas like php project
62:24 - ideas because there are a lot of them
62:26 - out there and you probably get a nice
62:28 - big list and just pick pick the ones
62:29 - that you like
62:32 - oh michael creole says on click
62:36 - uh so michael cruz says create a css
62:38 - class to do the uh dot add class on
62:41 - click
62:42 - cool thanks michael
62:45 - that's straightforward enough right
62:49 - uh
62:51 - m m ray
62:53 - it's e-m-r-e so i'm not sure how to
62:55 - pronounce that it says i've been i've
62:57 - coding experience for two years and i
62:59 - know c and c plus so how much time
63:02 - uh to learn javascript css and html uh
63:05 - and i'm from turkey well hello this is
63:08 - the second person uh they said they're
63:10 - from turkey so uh welcome
63:12 - yeah
63:14 - if you already know c and c plus plus i
63:16 - don't think it's going to be that
63:17 - difficult to pick up a new language
63:19 - because you already have all those
63:21 - programming concepts down right uh
63:24 - you know
63:25 - your basic things are like like arrays
63:28 - loops
63:29 - um
63:30 - like the concepts of of what is a
63:32 - variable like all those things that
63:35 - seem really easy once you pick them up
63:37 - you know to a total beginner it's it's
63:39 - difficult to
63:41 - you know to wrap your mind around that
63:43 - so you're already starting at an
63:45 - advantage
63:47 - so i like it i can't really say
63:50 - it'll take this long because it just
63:52 - depends like how many hours a day do you
63:54 - have uh how quick can you pick things up
63:57 - like there's just a lot of factors but i
64:00 - think you'll have a much easier time
64:02 - than
64:03 - than you know someone else you know
64:05 - who's doesn't know about programming
64:10 - machine says is there some tool to
64:13 - transpile jquery into plain old
64:14 - javascript so your clients don't have to
64:16 - download an extra file
64:19 - i don't really know that would kind of
64:20 - be a pretty useful tool though
64:23 - but i don't i've never heard of anything
64:25 - like that existing
64:27 - i don't see why it couldn't though
64:30 - i mean if we can transpile
64:32 - um you know
64:34 - newer versions of javascript back to
64:38 - es5 i guess they could do the same thing
64:41 - for jquery but but to my knowledge it
64:43 - doesn't exist i've never heard of it
64:46 - uh john cortez says thanks for answering
64:48 - my questions looking forward to watching
64:49 - more your videos aloha and mahalo from
64:52 - los angeles
64:55 - cool i'm so glad that um
64:58 - i could be of some service to you
65:01 - and yeah definitely i hope you can join
65:03 - again for some some live and
65:05 - more live chats and stuff and yeah feel
65:07 - free to keep asking questions
65:10 - and
65:11 - let's see
65:12 - uh dante says i am
65:15 - i am dan from kenya
65:18 - enjoy the enjoying the live feed really
65:20 - learned a lot how can i improve my react
65:21 - skills uh really just practice right i
65:25 - mean it it doesn't hurt to read up on
65:27 - documentation and like watch tutorials
65:30 - and things but the thing that's going to
65:32 - help you to get
65:33 - better the the quickest route is just
65:36 - keep building try every day
65:38 - if you can
65:39 - um to just build a little bit work with
65:42 - it uh and then
65:44 - you know as like the little things in
65:46 - react and the syntax the way to do
65:48 - things become like natural and you just
65:50 - have it in your mind all the time
65:52 - then it'll free up that brain power to
65:54 - start thinking like higher level of i'm
65:57 - gonna do more advanced things right and
65:59 - you'll start to build up on that and and
66:01 - you'll get better like like that
66:05 - michael says after a year of watching
66:06 - you uh i think i finally started to feel
66:09 - like i know what i'm talking about maybe
66:11 - sooner or later i'll actually apply for
66:13 - a job
66:15 - well i'm glad that i could i could help
66:17 - in that way yeah and
66:20 - go for it go for for a job
66:23 - um
66:24 - you know to get a job in coding all you
66:26 - need to do is convince somebody that you
66:28 - can do it right that
66:31 - uh you know and then you're ready and
66:33 - you're always gonna learn on the job and
66:35 - anybody that's hiring a developer that
66:37 - knows what they're doing will know that
66:39 - they're not hiring you because of what
66:41 - you already know they're gonna hire you
66:42 - because of what you're gonna continue to
66:44 - learn because things just change too
66:46 - fast
66:47 - right you even if you find somebody that
66:48 - knows everything that you want them to
66:50 - know in a couple months
66:52 - it's going to be outdated already
66:55 - so that's the that's the key so don't
66:57 - worry if you don't know everything yet
66:58 - as long as you can prove that
67:01 - that you you know what you're doing and
67:03 - that you can learn quickly
67:05 - that's that's what people want or at
67:08 - least that's what they should want if
67:09 - they know what they're doing
67:12 - uh
67:13 - dante says plus how much do i need to
67:15 - have in my portfolio to get at least
67:17 - junior front-end position
67:19 - i don't know if there's really you know
67:20 - a number uh but
67:22 - you know i would say
67:25 - you know have a few prizes so
67:27 - it's better to have maybe like three
67:29 - good projects that you've actually
67:31 - finished and built than you know like a
67:33 - dozen
67:34 - projects that that aren't really great
67:36 - and that you never finished right it's
67:38 - way more impressive to show somebody
67:39 - something that actually works and looks
67:41 - nice okay so
67:44 - quality is i think more important than
67:46 - quantity here
67:48 - so
67:50 - that would be my advice i mean
67:52 - personally from having reviewed resumes
67:54 - to hire developers before
67:57 - you know i i wasn't looking for have you
68:00 - done a million projects you know i i
68:02 - wanted to see i i could look at one
68:04 - project and if it was a big project and
68:07 - it was good like that's that's proof
68:09 - right so
68:10 - um
68:13 - i would try you know like
68:16 - more than one would be good
68:18 - i'm thinking like at least three would
68:19 - be nice
68:20 - uh showcasing maybe some different
68:22 - skills
68:24 - but don't go crazy with a lot of
68:27 - projects unless you have time to really
68:29 - do them well
68:33 - let's see
68:34 - john hanson says when refactoring a
68:37 - function in react
68:39 - and reffing state
68:41 - uh written const a state equals this
68:45 - state
68:46 - uh returns all states and component
68:49 - returns only a say why
68:53 - i am not sure
69:07 - ah you know what we ran into some issue
69:09 - with this recently in a previous stream
69:12 - i'm not sure how to describe it and what
69:13 - language to use but
69:15 - that a similar thing just happened so
69:18 - i'm sorry i can't explain why it happens
69:21 - like that
69:22 - uh
69:23 - i just i got it to work and i never
69:24 - looked up why
69:29 - so if anybody else knows
69:31 - i guess how to explain why that happens
69:34 - uh
69:35 - please put it put it in the the live
69:37 - chat
69:44 - uh kendo says uh how do we know when
69:46 - these live streams start uh probably
69:49 - well number one subscribe to free code
69:51 - cams youtube channel
69:53 - and um make sure you turn on
69:54 - notifications occasionally i do stream
69:57 - on my personal channel there's a link in
69:58 - the description
70:00 - if you subscribe to that you know you'll
70:02 - get notifications from that as well
70:04 - you can also follow me on twitter uh and
70:08 - or instagram
70:09 - i
70:10 - uh usually
70:13 - put before i i almost always notify
70:16 - everybody on both of those platforms
70:18 - before i do a stream
70:20 - so those are the main ways to know
70:23 - whether or not i'm i'm going to do a
70:25 - live stream
70:30 - uh two sources how to improve problem
70:32 - solving skills
70:34 - do problems right solve problems
70:36 - practice is definitely a way to do it
70:38 - there are some techniques so you could
70:40 - read up on techniques on how to solve
70:42 - like coding algorithm challenges and
70:44 - things so it's like some systematic
70:47 - steps
70:48 - so definitely try that but i think the
70:50 - most important thing is practice try to
70:52 - do an algorithm challenge like once a
70:55 - day you know just start out your day
70:57 - with you know an algorithm challenge and
70:59 - um you know make sure you get that
71:02 - practice in
71:05 - uh
71:06 - utku says i i just wanted to thank you
71:09 - for your time oh you're welcome i
71:11 - appreciate you saying that
71:14 - um
71:15 - mlv says uh are you front end or back
71:18 - end developer
71:19 - uh yeah i'm
71:22 - i don't know i guess the most accurate
71:24 - right now would probably be full stack
71:26 - if
71:27 - i do more front end than back end and my
71:30 - official title is front end but it's not
71:32 - exactly accurate
71:38 - let's see um
71:41 - mlb says parcel versus webpack what
71:43 - build tool is good i've never used
71:45 - parcel i use webpack i like webpack
71:48 - um
71:49 - i don't mess with configuring webpack
71:51 - myself though
71:52 - um
71:53 - i always use
71:55 - like the pre-configured stuff with
71:56 - either create react app or uh next js
71:59 - but
72:01 - i just i can't really comment on parcel
72:03 - because i haven't used it
72:08 - uh mlb says what is your youtube channel
72:11 - uh check the description of the video i
72:12 - have a link to it in there
72:14 - i can't
72:16 - it's jesse why if you look up jesse
72:18 - weigle on youtube it'll come up
72:29 - okay michael said that that issue so the
72:31 - issue that john hansen was just talking
72:32 - about it was on my last stream that i
72:34 - had that
72:39 - uh mr says thanks for answering my
72:42 - questions
72:44 - um and what should i start simple
72:46 - javascript or javascript frameworks like
72:48 - react angular what do you think which is
72:50 - best for me
72:52 - um
72:54 - start with some simple javascript before
72:56 - you move into a framework
72:57 - so you don't have to go crazy and learn
72:59 - everything but
73:01 - it'd be good just to get some of the
73:02 - basics down the syntax you know and
73:05 - before you jump right into a framework
73:08 - so you know that's my advice
73:11 - if you're going to start like taking on
73:12 - clients and stuff and you need to use a
73:14 - framework then you know go go for it you
73:16 - know it's it's not like it's gonna
73:18 - really you know hurt you as long as you
73:20 - continue to just keep learning as you go
73:24 - um
73:25 - zx says did you ever make voice
73:27 - activated programs uh like sappyspeak
73:32 - i did do an alexa an amazon uh alexa
73:36 - skill
73:37 - before
73:38 - so that's kind of the only thing that
73:39 - i've done that's voice activated
73:43 - and it was really basic it was just a um
73:45 - like a trivia quiz you could ask it to
73:47 - give you trivia it was it was a trivia
73:49 - quiz with trivia from my hometown
73:52 - so it would just give you a couple of
73:53 - different facts about my hometown
74:05 - uh mlb says should i use any css
74:07 - framework these days
74:09 - um
74:10 - i get it depends like if you're doing
74:12 - react
74:14 - i really like material ui
74:16 - if you're just doing some plain
74:17 - javascript stuff or jquery stuff maybe
74:20 - you want to go with bootstrap
74:22 - if you like material design style go
74:24 - with materialize
74:26 - some other good ones that i've never
74:28 - used but i heard are good or like
74:29 - foundation
74:31 - um
74:32 - what else
74:34 - actually i can't it's been a while since
74:35 - i've um
74:37 - i've already worked with any of those
74:41 - yeah but i mean you don't have to use a
74:42 - css framework but it definitely saves a
74:44 - lot of time
74:50 - uh mlb says how much javascript do i
74:52 - need to know to understand react you
74:53 - definitely need at least the basics of
74:55 - javascript to understand react so the
74:57 - more javascript you know
74:59 - the better you're going to be with react
75:01 - so you don't need to know everything but
75:03 - you're definitely better off learning
75:05 - more
75:10 - okay so steven says learn javascript
75:12 - first i'm about to start react myself i
75:14 - have a friend that is in a react
75:15 - bootcamp that knows no javascript and is
75:17 - struggling hard okay yeah def yeah you
75:20 - definitely want to know uh some some of
75:23 - it uh
75:25 - michael says no i was making a joke
75:30 - i don't i don't know where that was at
75:31 - when was that
75:38 - i don't even remember what it what it
75:40 - was or you're making a joke
75:42 - um hey javascript is here what's up
75:45 - uh
75:46 - mlb says is mernstag good for 2018
75:50 - um
75:52 - so mursack is what um express
75:57 - react node is that it
76:02 - mongodb i think that's mirnstack it
76:04 - stands for that uh so yeah i mean i
76:06 - think mernstack is still valid for sure
76:12 - um
76:13 - let's see
76:15 - uh tushar says do you also work with
76:17 - react native issues
76:19 - than with expo or plane react native
76:21 - i've done both
76:23 - i prefer using x-bow
76:25 - because it's it's pretty easy to um
76:30 - you know get it going on an actual phone
76:32 - like and see the results so i i do like
76:34 - using expo but
76:36 - um i have done both
76:40 - okay so mlv says yeah mern stack is
76:42 -  express react node so mongodb for
76:44 - your database
76:46 - um
76:46 - express express is like uh a node
76:49 - plug-in um
76:51 - to help run like your back end
76:53 - um with this node being javascript
76:55 - running server side and then react um
76:58 - would be which you use to build your
77:01 - your app and the stuff that the client
77:03 - sees right
77:05 - let's see
77:08 - uh mlb says do you use facebook yeah i
77:10 - am on facebook if you want to follow me
77:12 - on facebook feel free i just don't
77:13 - really ever post anything
77:19 - okay
77:20 - all right let's see what time it is oh
77:22 - okay well i just got to the end of the
77:25 - live chat and
77:26 - i i have to go to a meeting in a few
77:28 - minutes so
77:30 - uh i'm gonna finish up here i i don't
77:32 - know if i'm gonna be able to stream
77:34 - until next week
77:35 - uh so
77:37 - if
77:38 - i guess have a great week everyone
77:40 - uh
77:41 - i'll try to give some updates
77:43 - um on twitter and um
77:46 - instagram from my conference
77:48 - and
77:49 - yeah so
77:51 - thank you all so much

78:03 - social media uh this upcoming week but
78:06 - uh so until then have a great day uh
78:09 - have a great week and thanks again

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today i'm probably not going to accomplish what i've set out to accomplish because i don't even know if this is gonna work i've never done it before i've never even heard of anybody doing it before and i haven't found an example of someone else doing it so i look at today as an adventure as we're gonna try some stuff out i'm going to do my best to explain and make this even if we fail i'm going to try to make it you know somewhat useful to you all in terms of you know some of the stuff that we do hopefully will be uh applicable to to your work i'm probably only going to do one pomodoro session of code today because i have um a meeting and i got to get some some data ready for my meeting so i want to make sure i can answer all your questions so maybe i'll do one pomodoro session and then we'll spend the rest of the time answering questions and that should give me enough time to answer everything uh so we'll see how much code we can actually squeeze in i have a lot of comments already in the chat which is awesome so let me just take maybe just a minute no longer just to say hi and welcome any any new people right so looks like hey max i'm not gonna read all the hellos out i'm just gonna just gonna check uh i do read all of these so i'm not missing anybody but there's a lot so i'm gonna skip over a bit here all right awesome okay cool uh i did have somebody ask how i am uh so i'm doing uh pretty pretty well uh if you've been with with the stream for a while you know i'm still recovering from wrist surgery my wrist actually hurts a lot today so it's not that bad that i think it'll really affect my my typing so i think we'll be fine and this may end up being my only stream this week because i'm gonna go to the react rally conference in salt lake city and then i'm gonna go straight from there to uh to new york city to go to the um free code camp top contributor uh event uh that they're having out there so if anybody is in any of those areas and you know wants to hang out or something please let me know um but i'll try to um like give updates of what's going on on on instagram and twitter and stuff so i'm not sure if i can get a live stream in or anything when i'm there depends on the internet but if you if you follow me on those social media platforms uh then at least i'll be um i'll still be around you if you have any questions feel free to reach out to me okay okay looks like i'm getting all right what's going on here somebody says check the voice can everybody hear me my mic is showing that it's it's working or my uh my obs screen is showing it's working let me know also someone saying about the videos loading okay so i'm not sure what's up with that let me know if y'all can hear me and can see me uh i'm gonna go into the code now um so i see there's a lot of questions in there after i do some code for about 25 minutes i'm gonna come back and answer all your questions okay so uh just hang in there let's switch over so you can see the screen okay so here's some of the code i have uh made some updates and i'll explain more we're kind of going in a different direction with the home page layout so i can explain that later on if you want uh and you can also check out what i've done if you look at the commit log on the github repo the um the link to that's in the description to this video okay so today we'll mostly be working in this server.js file because we're gonna be dealing with uh the salesforce api so i'm gonna bring over some stuff onto the screen let me start my pomodoro timer okay i'm gonna pull over some of the stuff that i've been looking at so y'all can check it out and i will paste the links into the uh the live chat as well so i came across this uh on github and this repo i know you'll probably can't see it i'm gonna zoom in here actually let me put these together and make them a lot bigger here so it's easier for everybody to see okay so i came across across this repo it looks like a really old repo but it has been updated recently a lot of the files have been updated so i'm assuming that it it still works we'll find out uh but this is gonna allow us to more easily connect to uh the salesforce api okay so here's the documentation for that and right now i'm looking at how to connect right and so let's go back to our getting started because we're gonna start right right at the beginning okay we can install this right you know just with uh npm uh we're gonna use yarn because we've been been using yarn and i'll need to i'll need to do a little bit on another screen because i need to put in my credentials so um that's about the only thing you won't be able to see everything else i'll try to do here all right so first let's install js force and my goal now in this session is just to get a connection see if we can connect where's our codes whoops all right let's pull this over okay so i'm gonna do a yarn let me make this bigger i'll go one more size larger here all right so here's my terminal i'm going to say yarn um you know what let's do this on a separate branch because i don't want to mess anything up in the server file so let's create a let's do git checkout and we're going to do put a b flag on there and then we're going to say we're going to call this um let's say we'll call it salesforce okay so i like to do uh get checkout with a b flag because if i try to do a uh get branch create the branch and then check out i often forget to actually check out the branch so we're gonna do this in a branch if you're using git to do version control if you're going to put a new feature in especially if it's either like a major feature or you think you might be like break something uh while you're doing it you generally want to do it on a separate branch if you're committing to someone else's project you for sure want to do it on another branch so this will allow us to feel free to break things do anything we want and we can always switch back to the master branch and make updates and push that up to in this case the site's not live yet but we do have a development site that's that's out there so i definitely recommend doing that so now that we have it on this branch now we can do a yarn uh add js force i'm gonna double check that name js force yep that's it all right so that shouldn't take too long and while that's going we can see how we're going to bring this in so there is a way to do this in browser but i'm not going to do that we have node running we're going to use node we're going to send data from from the back end the goal of this is to be able to send data straight from our react application from a form on our react application straight into salesforce right now we are sending people prospective students if they want to inquire about to get more information about our university they have to click a link they're directed to another site that has a form on it it would be a lot more convenient if they never had to leave our site or even click away from a page if we just had the form right there on the home page as you scroll down you'll eventually see it and you could put in some info i think we'll get a much higher conversion rate let's say on our on our inquiry form okay all right great that's there that's that's in there now um so let me make some space here for our server.js our server.js file is is quite crowded right now so eventually if we get this to work we'll probably move it to its own separate file but for now i'm just going to do it here uh just to save some time okay so let's copy some of this stuff and paste it up here and i'm going to change these vars to const okay generally when you're using es6 right or they call es 2015 it's a newer version of javascript some some additions to it when you're using that you want to use const or let in place of vare if you're not sure why and you want to know you can ask me after this pomodoro sessions over i'll be happy to explain like why you would use one or the other but there's really no need to use there anymore okay could not find declaration for our module for js force hmm let's double check and make sure that this works i thought it did oh maybe it didn't okay let's see um all right got a lot of stuff not working here hmm maybe this isn't going to work let's check the uh the github repo again and we'll go to issues and see what's happening 195 issues is actually a lot maybe this is not really being maintained anymore okay i mean based on the issues that people are are posting here they've obviously got it to to install okay let's go back here i wonder if you have to have a certain version of node so i'm going to double check i don't remember seeing anything about that okay let's check releases see if there's any info there all right i'm alright they just came out with a new release 19 days ago all right let's i'm just going to run yarn again all right everything's up to date that's weird why can't we find js force i don't really want to open up my node modules um just gonna run this one more time it probably won't work but you never know like it does happen that you just try the same thing again and and now it works so um we'll give it another go okay didn't get all these i did not get all these errors this time and hmm all right i'm just gonna let that go for now because i don't think it's gonna matter so let's move on then it's good to know that that they have had a recent release though i do want to check my time all right about 15 minutes okay now that we've gone through the installation let's go to document let's go here and look at how we connect so i'm just gonna copy and paste this this part this seems like it's the simplest way to connect so we'll try this first there's a lot of other stuff about ways to connect not worried about it right now okay so we definitely need okay so it looks like all we need to put in here yeah all we need to put in here is a login url a username and a password okay cool so i can just put the login url right in here and that's not going to be a problem uh the username and password i'm going to save is environment variables and then pull them in and so i don't show my uh my password to everybody okay so first things first uh and this would be easy what is this extra speak uh let's get that that login url so here's salesforce let's see tesla says what should i call all right i'm not even sure where let's see where this is log out this should take me yep there we are um so i believe this would be the login url and then for username and password i am going to open up the environment variable file on another on another screen so i'm gonna pull this over to my other screen and okay it'll just take me a second to navigate there hmm it's not let me open this uh let's see all right i wonder if i can do i not have a dot m that's so weird i thought i had one that's so weird okay then i guess i will try to make one okay hold on a second for some reason visual studio code does not want to let me open this project twice all right let's just make an mfile and i will drag it over to my other window there we are okay now we'll go back here close this here and i'll say okay so on my other screen i'm gonna go to lastpass and find my username and password and my username okay all right and i should be able to bring these in in the same way that that these are being brought in so let's just copy this save a little bit of time here um and let's make this username and i call this uh username and then we'll copy and paste this and change it to password okay all right so let's see who we're doing all right so what we're looking for hopefully is that we will get some stuff logged to the console okay uh also we should probably check to make sure we haven't crashed anything so all right it looks like nothing is crashed on the side so that's good uh we can check okay oh you know what let's let's quit that and let's do a um yarn oops let's say sorry i gotta check out actu let's just run this like this let's do node server yes okay all right we're not getting anything in our console you know what let's check our documentation this is all right about five more minutes i'll get your questions so i see there's a ton of stuff in the live chat so uh i'm i'm gonna get to everything all right well let's see let's assume that we've made some sort of connection and let's go down and see if we can make a query now let's see hmm this is trying to find one that would work with what data we have i also don't want to get any data that i should not be showing on youtube oh how about let's just try to create something and then i don't have to actually show anything um all right let's try this i'm not sure if i'd need to put this inside of here or not we'll try it inside first all right yeah let's just show this as is why is it saying this oh indentation okay i do i want to see let me make sure i'm just going to go through kind of each step just to make sure things are getting picked up correctly oh you know what i'm not automatically restarting the server now since i i just did this okay all right so we're getting undefined here and now we're getting invalid using password security token okay all right that makes sense why it's not working all right so what's up with this then i don't know what i did all right you know what let me let me move this over to my other screen just quickly and i'm gonna i'm gonna hard code those values directly into the file i need to do it on my other screen obviously because i can't have anybody seeing that but i just want to make sure you know what the the real problem is here i mean if we've done all the salesforce stuff correctly and it's just something weird going on with the dot m file then i i want to know so i don't spend my time trying to troubleshoot the wrong thing so my 25 minute timer just ended so this would be the last thing that i try okay i'm going to save that and let's restart the server see what happened oh user must use security token okay all right so i need to get a security token from salesforce and then use add that to my password okay what do you all think let me know should we try that just see if we can get it to work or should i stop now and um go to the questions all right reset my security token oh i sent one to my email address okay so i just reset the security token and they are emailing it to me if it doesn't come in my email like immediately i'll just uh try this a different day oh nice it just got here okay and add it to my password so i'm assuming i can just paste this right at the end of my password so that's what i'm going to do all right we'll give this one more try what i'm pretty sure this just worked so we created these records nice i wonder if i can now search for these records by id um so let me go in i'm logged into salesforce on my other screen i'm gonna see if i can search for a record uh let's see i don't know what they have under normally it's leads um but i'm not sure if they use that that terminology so it obviously it looks like it worked i'm just not entirely sure where where it saved this to so maybe so normally in salesforce you'd use it for a business and then there would be um you would call them leads but we usually do students so i wonder if this got saved as a student so sorry i can't show you all this i don't want to accidentally show you student information so i'm just trying to do my best to describe what what i'm doing on my other screen if i get to a point where i can show you i will definitely do that let me see um let's see if i can search search students um record id yes all right so i don't think it's that so what i'll probably need to do is i'll need to do a little bit more reading to see like where by default does this stuff show up since i'm not seeing it oh wait a second i found it alright cool now i have something i can actually show you let me move this over here okay so check this out so evidently it by default goes to schools and it it made these schools okay so i'll have to figure out how to put it in the right spot ideally we'd want these to go into um students right but this works for now so you could see we gave it the name of my account one and my account two and um so obviously it didn't fill in these things right because um we didn't tell it to fill these in but you can see by the owner alias is it's me uh just the first part of my name jwig okay so awesome that worked we're able to connect and we could see like here's the the id right i have a server here uh cool really cool all right awesome so now i'm gonna go to i guess i'll just let me switch it up here uh and now i'm gonna go back to the chat i'm gonna start way up at the top and i'm just gonna work my way down here so um i'm going to try to get to all of the questions i think this was definitely a success um in terms of you know we were actually able to add a record that's awesome now it's just a matter of figuring out the details of being able to add it as a student and get the right match up the right values uh so i'm i'm feeling really really happy about that and i can't believe it only took me to me like less than an hour uh for people who have watched this stream before you know this is a rare occurrence that everything goes like how i wanted it to go and quickly okay steven says jesse thanks for looking at the landmark site that floor plan popup build was a huge speed boost for us build wise oh awesome yeah that site was amazing uh so it was like reid was really cool i'm really glad you shared it with me uh let's see nikki says uh just dropping by to say hi hey assagor sorry you couldn't stick can't stick around but thanks for dropping by um nagendra asks for an angular project um i don't know angular so i can't really do an angular project but we do have some videos of people doing angular projects i don't think they're live streams but check the the video list for free code camp maybe do a search for angular i know we we've had some people do angular before um let's see somebody asked what i what am i gonna do i'm not gonna answer that because obviously you saw what i was gonna do so um microscope says hi from turkey hey how's it going thanks for watching uh luis says hello from guadalajara mexico uh awesome lovely with people from all over the world john doses bonjour from france otsm says 81 says hello from a noob from colorado how's it going i'm a noob from ohio originally from west virginia let's see m alvey says you're looking awesome superb thank you i appreciate that not sure if you're talking about my code or my face but either way i appreciate it somebody commented on one of my recent videos i think on my last video something like react.js is so ugly and i thought react.js is probably not ugly it's probably just my code right i'm sure there are people out there that can make it look pretty all right uh dash says what about the ujs i don't know vue one it would be cool one day to drive you out but for right now um my projects are done to react and it would have to be a side project like i'm it doesn't make sense for me to do one project and view for work when like everything we're creating is all react so we can reuse components and things so but i'm open to doing a side project with you but it would have to be something really basic because i've never used it before we do have some videos about views so you know again if you go to free code camp videos do a search for for view you know you'll find some some view tutorial videos and things john cortez says i'm new to coding i may not get what you'll be talking about but i'm here to learn as i'm changing my career to become a coder awesome awesome congratulations uh on the on the career change and uh yeah feel free to ask any questions uh if i'm kind of skipping by things too fast just you know ask me i'm more than happy to explain you know anything uh morillo says is it worth it to learn about canvas uh it depends on what you want to do i mean there are some instances where canvas is the right thing to use um but there's a like i personally never use canvas i've never come across a use case where canvas made sense for me to use so and and i've been a developer for like over five years now so i would say don't just learn canvas if you don't have to use it that would be my advice if you come like fig learn what canvas is and what it's good for and then leave it at that so then that way if you ever have a situation where canvas would be good at least you'll know that you should use canvas and then at that point you can learn more about canvas i mean if you have a lot of free time and you really just want to learn canvas you know go ahead but i don't think it's it's necessary all right john cortez says is coding boot camp worth it uh it can be it so it kind of depends on what kind of learner you are for me i just i was always working and learning at the same time i never had a period of time where i could dedicate all my time to a coding bootcamp uh so i when i started when i shifted my career into being a developer i already had a wife and kids and a mortgage payment and i so i couldn't full time like learn i just learned what i needed to do to get the job done for my clients so a boot camp was kind of out of the question for me at least like an intense boot camp so i did more like online courses a lot of free stuff a lot of just learning on my own but some people they thrive in that boot camp setting and they learn a lot quickly so you have to know yourself there also not all boot camps are the same some boot camps aren't really that good so you gotta you know do your research and you know figure out like do you have the time for the boot camp the money for the boot camp is that your learning style and then is that particular boot camp good so it's not really a question that i could i could answer in general you know okay uh ash axe says sorry i misprint might be mispronouncing that uh it says teach us how to code using mobile please we did do some streams using react native to code things for android and ios i'd love to get back to that at some point i just need to get this project launched i'm going to be honest with you this is going to be even once we launch this it's not going to be finished you know there's always going to be more things to do and to update but i would love to shift it so that our main project moves to something else for this stream potentially maybe a react native project um and then i do a lot of the work for this project right now kind of off the stream and i only come back to it when we're gonna add like some cool feature that i think you all be interested in um mlv says how much do you code in 24 hours oh it just depends it depends on the 24 hours so um there have been times when i've i've worked for like 14 hours uh like if i have to launch a project and there's a lot of stuff to do sometimes it's i've coded for that long before uh that's pretty extreme um and obviously there are some 24hour periods where i don't code at all but trying to get an average i don't know maybe like an average would be like five hours a day or something i don't know because i don't spend all day coding um i answer emails i do paperwork i go to meetings so it's it kind of depends um mlv asked about the github dark theme yeah if you just type in github dark uh theme on google it'll be the first thing that'll come up just follow the instructions and um yeah it's not it's not difficult i think there's several options for getting it to work too also asks uh we want we wanted to know more about yourself um let me know what specifically do you want to know i mean i can tell you a lot about myself but i if there's anything in particular let me know um and then i'll i'll answer that once i get down to the bottom there um ma'am alvey says what's your skills front end or back end so my title is front end developer but realistically i'm more like full stack now to be honest i say i probably do more front end than back end but we don't have somebody that's a back end so like node stuff is backend stuff right i do that i set up servers right i set up linux servers i do the maintenance on those servers i set up databases right so all that stuff i i do as well so i'm definitely not purely front end it just worked out that that's the title that that i had uh because at you know at the time it was i was mostly doing front end stuff so alright let's just you know let's go with front end um john cortez asked about my application for coding and i was using visual studio code um mlb says does anyone have a slack workspace for coding help um i don't know do we have a slack channel i'm not sure we've had some channels like chat chat room things and um but i'm not they're not really that active but if anybody knows of some sort of like slack channel for coding help you know uh please let uh m alvi uh no let's see um john cortez says is what jesse is doing now something that can be learned within that threemonth boot camp um maybe i it depends so michael had a good answer says if you're starting from zero javascript knowledge it might take a while to build up if you have knowledge in javascript um you should be able to pick it up yeah i i totally agree with that answer um yeah if you're starting from zero it's gonna be hard to get here in in three months um i'm not saying what i'm doing is spectacular or anything but it just it takes time you know to get to there uh so yeah but if you're already good with javascript and it's just a matter of learning how to do things with react yeah three months is definitely reasonable and it's hard to say sometimes it depends on the person you know if you're like a genius who knows what you could do uh so john says should i uh john cortez says should i concentrate on learning html and javascript yeah for sure um if yeah start out if you go to the free code camp curriculum so if you go to freecodecamp.org and you start the curriculum that's a good place to start go through it'll teach you about html css and then it'll get you into javascript and it will ease you in you know so you you get you know that knowledge builds and then you work your way up into more difficult things you'll learn a little react so that's kind of a good path to go and then you can supplement your learning with with other materials um michael said this seems like it should be factored out yeah yeah for sure i think it should be too all right m4t says what is that program that you use i'm assuming you're talking about visual studio code okay all right michael asked what's the graphic on my mug okay so here's my my mug so this is uh it says fatherhood the best job uh you'll ever love okay so and then on the back here it has um st joseph uh holding baby jesus and mary uh taking a nap in the background so i don't remember who got me this mug but i work at a a catholic university so it's definitely appropriate i think i got this like when i first became a father so my oldest is nine years old so i've had it for a while here but in case you don't know i have four children uh jai jainam it's jainam please let me know if i'm pronouncing that wrong i i want to get it right but anyway it says what is the salesforce api uh salesforce api is just a way to get data from salesforce and put data into salesforce by making um well api calls right so you make like an http request and you can use the uh the api let me know if i need to explain that a little bit more so it may not depending on your level of understanding right now i may need to explain a little bit more so i'm happy to do that if you need me to kendo says hello from japan hey how's it going you know i i rarely get viewers from japan so that's really awesome thanks for letting me know um says what is codeigniter framework developer uh codeigniter is i believe codeigniter is php i think it's a php uh like framework or something so i from what i understand it's it's kind of old but i i haven't used it i a colleague of mine has used it before and that's the only i just remember him talking about it uh ivan says hi can you show how to hide and show content text in html with buttons thanks in advance uh congrats from uh bulgaria well hi and welcome um if you want to show and hide uh text in html with buttons uh you could it depends on what you want to do right you could use just overall like you would want to use javascript to tell when that button gets clicked and then when that button gets clicked uh you could change the css of that button to use um you know to show or hide so it would be like um display none or display block you could toggle that uh if you were using and you could use jquery for that you could use vanilla javascript if you were using react you would want to change the state uh on a button click um and then you could just render it based on like uh if the state for this equals true render it otherwise don't render it right so there's there's different ways you could do it it kind of depends on what what you want to use so i mean that's kind of a big overview for that uh if you want to know like specifically what code you would type um you know your best bet is probably like just doing check and stack overflow or something uh because it it does kind of depend on what you want to use stephen says every feature you do is cool hashtag hype thank you i appreciate that um bogdan says hi can i become in six months a junior developer oh yeah for sure i mean obviously it depends on how much you know now and uh you know how quickly you can learn things but i think it's definitely possible in six months michael says i didn't realize you set up servers too uh you really need to get a title change yeah yeah i guess i should it hasn't i don't even remember when i got this title to be honest with you so maybe it has been a while maybe i should try to get a change we'll see maybe i'll wait until they give me like employees that to work under me and then i'll then i'll go for the title chains uh microscope says i know how to learn programming but i don't know what to do i need an idea also i'm too used to visual studio code this program perfect in atom or sublime i'm not sure what you're asking uh you're saying you don't know what to do you need an idea so are you saying you you don't really have an idea of what to build or what's it what to make uh if you just google like app ideas there are websites out there that give you a ton of like ideas of things to build so those will give you some ideas um also i i do like visual studio code i never use sublime i did use adam and i switched to visual studio code i think visual studio code is a bit faster than that atom but atom is still good i i used it for years so i think either one would be a good choice i just i happen to prefer visual studio code at the moment oh michael has confirmed that cody knighter is php based okay so ivan says uh yes to to do the show hide thing in javascript um yeah if you wanted to do it in just plain vanilla javascript you have no jquery no react anything like that um then you're gonna be using um i mean i guess off the top of my head like you're gonna be selecting elements with document.getelementbyid you want to grab the ids and then say what the click is so you would need to get like a click handler right uh if i'm assuming you click the buttons and then like depending i think i can't remember what is vanilla javascript way for changing css but that's how that's how you would do it you would use javascript to change the css i mean potentially you could completely add or remove those elements from the page but i don't know that i would go to all that i would i would probably just use display display none or like michael says you could do visibility hidden too if you want that would also work the only thing about visibility hidden is if your your text takes up space and you do visibility hidden like that space will still be there uh you just won't see the text if you don't want that space there then you want to do display none because it'll totally you know take away any space that it'll take up correct me if i'm wrong about that but i i believe that's that's how that functions um gia says is this project nearly finished how do you think how long do you think it's going to take i hope we're nearly finished i mean we're very very close to being able to launch i'm talking like within a matter of weeks we can we can launch for sure maybe maybe sooner i mean i i just have other stuff going on that i can't launch it so if i had all my time to dedicate to it we could probably have a launch next week but i i don't um yeah so i mean in terms of launch pretty soon in terms of finished i'm it's never going to be finished this is going to be the thing that i'm constantly working on and updating uh so you know this is just like this project is basically going to be a big part of my job now from here on out i'm constantly going to be updating it uh kendo says what are you using for seo for react should i be using something like next.js yeah if you need to worry about seo which is search engine optimization i definitely recommend using something like next js it doesn't have to be you just need to server side render your code otherwise search engines are not going to be able to pick up any of the the stuff that you're trying to pull in from an api so um the api calls usually take too long if you're trying to do a client side and the search engines won't stick around long enough to actually see that that data come in so you you want a server side render so that when someone first goes to your site they get just regular html all the contents there and then when they start clicking around in its clientside routing happening then you know that's cool you can you can do stuff on client side uh so i personally i like doing both it's kind of like best of both worlds you get that speed of clientside routing you know but you also get that really quick initial load that's uh search engine friendly so next js takes care of a lot of the the background stuff of making that happen for you so i do i do like using uh next.js for that michael says how do you get free code cam projects on github you just have to you know make a github account and create a new repo and then do your your project so i'm not sure how familiar you are with git and github so you might need to maybe do a course or read up on that first sorry i think yawn i always yawned during the streams today hasn't been too bad i've been fighting holding back of the yawns um tushar says can you recommend some projects for intermediate programmers in php um i i don't really know i would recommend again like um just googling project ideas like php project ideas because there are a lot of them out there and you probably get a nice big list and just pick pick the ones that you like oh michael creole says on click uh so michael cruz says create a css class to do the uh dot add class on click cool thanks michael that's straightforward enough right uh m m ray it's emre so i'm not sure how to pronounce that it says i've been i've coding experience for two years and i know c and c plus so how much time uh to learn javascript css and html uh and i'm from turkey well hello this is the second person uh they said they're from turkey so uh welcome yeah if you already know c and c plus plus i don't think it's going to be that difficult to pick up a new language because you already have all those programming concepts down right uh you know your basic things are like like arrays loops um like the concepts of of what is a variable like all those things that seem really easy once you pick them up you know to a total beginner it's it's difficult to you know to wrap your mind around that so you're already starting at an advantage so i like it i can't really say it'll take this long because it just depends like how many hours a day do you have uh how quick can you pick things up like there's just a lot of factors but i think you'll have a much easier time than than you know someone else you know who's doesn't know about programming machine says is there some tool to transpile jquery into plain old javascript so your clients don't have to download an extra file i don't really know that would kind of be a pretty useful tool though but i don't i've never heard of anything like that existing i don't see why it couldn't though i mean if we can transpile um you know newer versions of javascript back to es5 i guess they could do the same thing for jquery but but to my knowledge it doesn't exist i've never heard of it uh john cortez says thanks for answering my questions looking forward to watching more your videos aloha and mahalo from los angeles cool i'm so glad that um i could be of some service to you and yeah definitely i hope you can join again for some some live and more live chats and stuff and yeah feel free to keep asking questions and let's see uh dante says i am i am dan from kenya enjoy the enjoying the live feed really learned a lot how can i improve my react skills uh really just practice right i mean it it doesn't hurt to read up on documentation and like watch tutorials and things but the thing that's going to help you to get better the the quickest route is just keep building try every day if you can um to just build a little bit work with it uh and then you know as like the little things in react and the syntax the way to do things become like natural and you just have it in your mind all the time then it'll free up that brain power to start thinking like higher level of i'm gonna do more advanced things right and you'll start to build up on that and and you'll get better like like that michael says after a year of watching you uh i think i finally started to feel like i know what i'm talking about maybe sooner or later i'll actually apply for a job well i'm glad that i could i could help in that way yeah and go for it go for for a job um you know to get a job in coding all you need to do is convince somebody that you can do it right that uh you know and then you're ready and you're always gonna learn on the job and anybody that's hiring a developer that knows what they're doing will know that they're not hiring you because of what you already know they're gonna hire you because of what you're gonna continue to learn because things just change too fast right you even if you find somebody that knows everything that you want them to know in a couple months it's going to be outdated already so that's the that's the key so don't worry if you don't know everything yet as long as you can prove that that you you know what you're doing and that you can learn quickly that's that's what people want or at least that's what they should want if they know what they're doing uh dante says plus how much do i need to have in my portfolio to get at least junior frontend position i don't know if there's really you know a number uh but you know i would say you know have a few prizes so it's better to have maybe like three good projects that you've actually finished and built than you know like a dozen projects that that aren't really great and that you never finished right it's way more impressive to show somebody something that actually works and looks nice okay so quality is i think more important than quantity here so that would be my advice i mean personally from having reviewed resumes to hire developers before you know i i wasn't looking for have you done a million projects you know i i wanted to see i i could look at one project and if it was a big project and it was good like that's that's proof right so um i would try you know like more than one would be good i'm thinking like at least three would be nice uh showcasing maybe some different skills but don't go crazy with a lot of projects unless you have time to really do them well let's see john hanson says when refactoring a function in react and reffing state uh written const a state equals this state uh returns all states and component returns only a say why i am not sure ah you know what we ran into some issue with this recently in a previous stream i'm not sure how to describe it and what language to use but that a similar thing just happened so i'm sorry i can't explain why it happens like that uh i just i got it to work and i never looked up why so if anybody else knows i guess how to explain why that happens uh please put it put it in the the live chat uh kendo says uh how do we know when these live streams start uh probably well number one subscribe to free code cams youtube channel and um make sure you turn on notifications occasionally i do stream on my personal channel there's a link in the description if you subscribe to that you know you'll get notifications from that as well you can also follow me on twitter uh and or instagram i uh usually put before i i almost always notify everybody on both of those platforms before i do a stream so those are the main ways to know whether or not i'm i'm going to do a live stream uh two sources how to improve problem solving skills do problems right solve problems practice is definitely a way to do it there are some techniques so you could read up on techniques on how to solve like coding algorithm challenges and things so it's like some systematic steps so definitely try that but i think the most important thing is practice try to do an algorithm challenge like once a day you know just start out your day with you know an algorithm challenge and um you know make sure you get that practice in uh utku says i i just wanted to thank you for your time oh you're welcome i appreciate you saying that um mlv says uh are you front end or back end developer uh yeah i'm i don't know i guess the most accurate right now would probably be full stack if i do more front end than back end and my official title is front end but it's not exactly accurate let's see um mlb says parcel versus webpack what build tool is good i've never used parcel i use webpack i like webpack um i don't mess with configuring webpack myself though um i always use like the preconfigured stuff with either create react app or uh next js but i just i can't really comment on parcel because i haven't used it uh mlb says what is your youtube channel uh check the description of the video i have a link to it in there i can't it's jesse why if you look up jesse weigle on youtube it'll come up okay michael said that that issue so the issue that john hansen was just talking about it was on my last stream that i had that uh mr says thanks for answering my questions um and what should i start simple javascript or javascript frameworks like react angular what do you think which is best for me um start with some simple javascript before you move into a framework so you don't have to go crazy and learn everything but it'd be good just to get some of the basics down the syntax you know and before you jump right into a framework so you know that's my advice if you're going to start like taking on clients and stuff and you need to use a framework then you know go go for it you know it's it's not like it's gonna really you know hurt you as long as you continue to just keep learning as you go um zx says did you ever make voice activated programs uh like sappyspeak i did do an alexa an amazon uh alexa skill before so that's kind of the only thing that i've done that's voice activated and it was really basic it was just a um like a trivia quiz you could ask it to give you trivia it was it was a trivia quiz with trivia from my hometown so it would just give you a couple of different facts about my hometown uh mlb says should i use any css framework these days um i get it depends like if you're doing react i really like material ui if you're just doing some plain javascript stuff or jquery stuff maybe you want to go with bootstrap if you like material design style go with materialize some other good ones that i've never used but i heard are good or like foundation um what else actually i can't it's been a while since i've um i've already worked with any of those yeah but i mean you don't have to use a css framework but it definitely saves a lot of time uh mlb says how much javascript do i need to know to understand react you definitely need at least the basics of javascript to understand react so the more javascript you know the better you're going to be with react so you don't need to know everything but you're definitely better off learning more okay so steven says learn javascript first i'm about to start react myself i have a friend that is in a react bootcamp that knows no javascript and is struggling hard okay yeah def yeah you definitely want to know uh some some of it uh michael says no i was making a joke i don't i don't know where that was at when was that i don't even remember what it what it was or you're making a joke um hey javascript is here what's up uh mlb says is mernstag good for 2018 um so mursack is what um express react node is that it mongodb i think that's mirnstack it stands for that uh so yeah i mean i think mernstack is still valid for sure um let's see uh tushar says do you also work with react native issues than with expo or plane react native i've done both i prefer using xbow because it's it's pretty easy to um you know get it going on an actual phone like and see the results so i i do like using expo but um i have done both okay so mlv says yeah mern stack is express react node so mongodb for your database um express express is like uh a node plugin um to help run like your back end um with this node being javascript running server side and then react um would be which you use to build your your app and the stuff that the client sees right let's see uh mlb says do you use facebook yeah i am on facebook if you want to follow me on facebook feel free i just don't really ever post anything okay all right let's see what time it is oh okay well i just got to the end of the live chat and i i have to go to a meeting in a few minutes so uh i'm gonna finish up here i i don't know if i'm gonna be able to stream until next week uh so if i guess have a great week everyone uh i'll try to give some updates um on twitter and um instagram from my conference and yeah so thank you all so much for joining me uh all the discussion was really great and yeah so i'll miss you all um hopefully i get to uh get to interact with some of you on social media uh this upcoming week but uh so until then have a great day uh have a great week and thanks again
