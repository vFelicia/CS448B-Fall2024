02:34 - in november of
02:35 - 2015 uh one of my clients when i worked
02:39 - full-time in venture capital had an
02:40 - extra ticket to go to the tony robbins
02:43 - uh event
02:44 - called upw meaning unleash the power
02:47 - within uh down in los angeles uh and so
02:49 - i i i graciously accepted and i went
02:52 - down
02:53 - and in la i think it was at the staples
02:55 - center or a very large convention center
02:57 - there's ten thousand people in the
02:58 - audience it was crazy it was awesome
03:00 - and it was a four-day event
03:02 - and we went through a lot of exercises
03:05 - goal setting workshops etc
03:08 - and then
03:09 - including walking across hot fire coals
03:12 - on the saturday night
03:14 - and tony conditioned us tony robbins
03:17 - and i actually ended up meeting him
03:18 - another time for business really reasons
03:20 - really nice guy but and when i shook his
03:22 - hand his hand like wrapped around my
03:23 - hand he's a big dude big dude but a
03:26 - really nice guy as well
03:28 - but what he did was on the saturday
03:30 - night of that four-day event back in
03:33 - 2015
03:35 - he
03:36 - had us walk across boiling hot coals
03:39 - like it looked like lava
03:41 - and he conditioned us to
03:43 - believe
03:44 - in our mind that we're not going to feel
03:46 - any pain at all
03:49 - he conditioned us to do that and so i
03:50 - walked across the coals
03:52 - and i didn't feel any pain at all it was
03:54 - exhilarating and of course i had lots of
03:55 - fire hoses there just in case whatever i
03:58 - didn't feel any pain it was amazing
04:00 - uh and and i went back to my hotel it
04:03 - was actually an airbnb that night uh in
04:04 - in la
04:06 - and i um i i couldn't sleep because i
04:09 - was excited but also because there's
04:10 - blisters in my feet and i had to take a
04:12 - bunch of advil
04:13 - my feet were fine though
04:15 - but that that event kind of changed me
04:17 - it really changed me and on the sunday
04:20 - of that four day event uh what tony
04:22 - robbins did was he said that
04:25 - write down your goals
04:26 - and he then said
04:28 - i want you to think of one particular
04:30 - goal
04:31 - that you've been kind of putting off for
04:32 - a while in your life
04:34 - and what i want you to do is i want you
04:36 - to write down that goal
04:37 - and i also want you to write down a
04:39 - deadline date
04:41 - okay most most people don't set deadline
04:42 - dates for goals
04:44 - and so what i did was i was writing this
04:45 - book for a couple of years you know uh
04:48 - and it's this book back here of course
04:50 - 101 crucial lessons i don't teach in
04:52 - business school
04:53 - and
04:54 - i
04:55 - every time i met with somebody very very
04:56 - successful i'd ask for advice and i
04:59 - documented
05:00 - and then what happened was um i wrote
05:02 - down a deadline date that sunday before
05:04 - i flew back home the fourth day of the
05:06 - conference
05:07 - and i wrote i'll finish this book in two
05:09 - or three weeks
05:11 - and i flew home
05:12 - and it was a sunday night
05:14 - then on a monday morning i went into

08:24 - going to go through this book this book
08:26 - uh in a lot a lot of detail a lot of
08:28 - detail and uh i published this um not

09:06 - yeah um and then uh what happened was
09:09 - i'm humbled to say that uh per this this
09:11 - video here um
09:13 - it was
09:14 - forbes wrote an article saying this is
09:16 - one of six books every entrepreneur
09:18 - should read right now along with lean
09:19 - startup zero to one by peter thiel uh
09:22 - the self-made um billionaire effect
09:25 - start with why by simon sinek and the
09:27 - seven habits of highly effective people
09:29 - by stephen covey i actually went to
09:30 - business school at columbia with stephen
09:32 - covey covey's kit yeah
09:34 - so this this kind of changed my life uh
09:36 - this this book uh and i i was very
09:39 - transparent in this book
09:41 - and i find that it's easier for me uh to
09:44 - read social media posts or books or
09:46 - articles if they're very very short when
09:48 - i was a kid i loved reading books by
09:51 - roald dahl
09:53 - he made james and the giant peach
09:55 - and charlie in the chocolate factory and
09:57 - that influenced me because roald dahl
09:59 - that his chapters were very very short
10:01 - it was just easy for me to to go through
10:03 - it and that's what i did with this book
10:05 - here as well i kept the chapters very
10:07 - very short uh and i'm humbled to say
10:10 - that it was also the number three
10:12 - bestseller i think the kindle version
10:13 - for a while on on on amazon it's still
10:15 - it's since trailed off a bunch troll off
10:18 - a bunch yeah
10:19 - but i had a lot of fun put this together
10:20 - so there's 17 sections in the book
10:24 - and we're going to talk about the book
10:25 - in two different parts and so as i
10:27 - mentioned before
10:28 - the first half of the book is today's
10:30 - is in today's workbook we're gonna do
10:32 - sections one through eight uh and then
10:35 - next class um we're gonna do the second
10:38 - half of the book and discuss sections
10:41 - nine through seventeen okay so let me
10:44 - show you what that means so if you go
10:46 - here to to the workbook
10:48 - um you'll see here that this is more
10:50 - than 50 pages and it might be the page
10:53 - link might be a little bit different
10:54 - depending on how many notes you take
10:56 - in this workbook
10:57 - as well as if you're using it on a
10:59 - different form factor or pdf version
11:02 - or the the word version microsoft word
11:04 - version but the contents are the same
11:06 - and so what i'll do is i will ask you to
11:08 - click on these numbers
11:10 - every now and then to start doing
11:12 - exercises and i'll make it very very
11:13 - intuitive to know exactly how to do this
11:15 - and when as well
11:17 - and so

11:19 - and then you click down here now
11:21 - if you can't see a hyperlink here after
11:24 - you click this then go up here and just
11:25 - click section one two three etc and what
11:28 - i did also
11:30 - was
11:31 - i put here the table of contents for the
11:33 - first half of the book
11:35 - and if you're using the microsoft word
11:37 - version of this document or the google
11:39 - docs version you can click on any of
11:41 - these to jump right to these chapters in
11:43 - in the book
11:44 - um it doesn't work i don't think on the
11:47 - pdf version so just scroll to where you
11:49 - should be
11:50 - so i included actually all of um
11:53 - all the content of the book the first
11:55 - half at least today and i'll include the
11:56 - next half of the book in next class's
11:58 - workbook so if you go here to section
12:01 - one
12:02 - i i talk about here high level what we

12:06 - i had a lot of fun with 3d images today
12:08 - too
12:09 - and then if you want you can type your
12:11 - notes here
12:12 - for lesson number one
12:14 - and below each
12:16 - lesson title
12:18 - is the actual text from the book and
12:20 - don't read this
12:21 - during class read it during during
12:22 - homework or on the side if you want to
12:24 - it's optional completely
12:26 - so you can take notes here on on lesson
12:29 - number one if you want to and what
12:30 - you've learned
12:33 - and what you can also do is if you go to

12:38 - take notes here again and again there's
12:40 - a text here from that chapter they're
12:42 - very short
12:43 - and you have to read the entire thing
12:45 - you can skim it or read another day
12:48 - all right so let me go back here to the
12:49 - top just we're on the same page does
12:52 - that work oh yeah good
12:53 - there we go good
12:55 - all right so um as i talk about all 101
12:59 - lessons in today's class and next class
13:01 - as well um you can take down notes as i
13:03 - just showed you
13:05 - in in the uh
13:07 - in the workbook you downloaded today
13:09 - so let's start now with with topic
13:11 - number one
13:13 - so uh
13:14 - section number one uh is called
13:17 - relationships are more important than
13:19 - product knowledge um and uh i have a
13:22 - little catch phrase for all all the
13:24 - sections in the book so the first cache
13:26 - phrase for section one is crucial
13:27 - networking tips to make you more
13:29 - successful now
13:30 - we've covered a bunch of this before so
13:32 - i'm just going to go over what we've
13:34 - already covered very quickly so i can
13:36 - focus much more attention on the new
13:37 - stuff but it's always important to
13:40 - re-emphasize what i've taught you before
13:42 - because
13:43 - repetition is the mother of all skill
13:46 - okay so the very first lesson is steve
13:49 - jobs winning strategy uh how to get
13:52 - anything you want
13:54 - um and and if you're watching the replay
13:55 - i mean the non-live version of this
13:57 - lecture uh what you can do if you want
13:59 - uh is
14:00 - you can actually go to um
14:02 - go to chapter one here or i should say
14:04 - uh the uh lesson number one by going
14:07 - here
14:08 - and what you can do is just click on
14:10 - this video here to watch a
14:12 - short video of steve jobs uh and if you
14:14 - don't want to click on this you can just
14:15 - search for three words uh in uh in
14:18 - youtube which are steve jobs ask
14:20 - um and
14:22 - you will never get anything you want in
14:24 - life now if you don't ask
14:27 - and when we were younger
14:29 - growing up um we were kids
14:32 - we asked our parents all the time for
14:35 - stuff you know like my youngest one
14:37 - drives me crazy i love them though he
14:39 - says dad can i have some candy i'll say
14:41 - no
14:42 - literally a minute later he'll say can i
14:43 - ask him kenny now
14:45 - no and then he'll ask again like five
14:47 - he's relentless relentless
14:50 - uh and then what happens is you stop
14:52 - asking once you've been conditioned to
14:54 - stop doing that for whatever reason um
14:58 - and and you can be tactful when you ask
15:00 - and not overdo it and upset people
15:02 - obviously but what happens is once we're
15:04 - done with high school
15:06 - for a lot of us when we go to a
15:07 - university or or start our first job
15:09 - whatever it is
15:11 - we don't really ask for anything because
15:13 - we learn that if we keep our heads down
15:15 - and we get good grades
15:17 - then everyone's proud of us and life
15:19 - works better
15:20 - but then what happens is many years into
15:22 - your career
15:24 - you wake up one day and you look around
15:26 - and you think to yourself my goodness
15:29 - why are all these other people around me
15:32 - getting uh getting promoted
15:34 - and not me
15:35 - why are all these other less capable
15:37 - people
15:38 - around me getting raises and not me
15:42 - and you realize and it might be too late
15:44 - or it's never too late but sometimes it
15:47 - it takes you to your 40s till you
15:48 - realize this
15:50 - that if you want a raise or promotion
15:52 - you have to ask
15:53 - nobody's ever made ceo or ever raised a
15:56 - lot of money as an entrepreneur without
15:59 - asking over and over and over and over
16:01 - again
16:02 - and do you ever see somebody that is is
16:04 - kind of average looking
16:07 - and uh their significant other is
16:10 - unbelievably attractive
16:12 - and
16:13 - you wonder what's going on
16:16 - why how did that happen and it's not
16:18 - always about money okay
16:19 - um it's it's because the the person
16:22 - that's less attractive and and we we
16:23 - refer to this usually as the matching
16:25 - principle in psychology
16:27 - you know people that are they're both
16:28 - very good looking usually end up dating
16:31 - but there's always
16:33 - an exception and many exceptions and
16:35 - it's not just about money
16:38 - it's about the person who
16:41 - is
16:42 - maybe average looking or whatever
16:44 - just thinking themselves
16:46 - i've got nothing to lose and everything
16:47 - to gain i'm going to keep asking people
16:49 - out over and over and over again because
16:51 - i know
16:52 - that the pain from being rejected a
16:54 - bunch of times is nothing
16:56 - compared to the pleasure which is
16:58 - massive
16:59 - of being of this person saying yes to a
17:02 - date so to speak you got to be
17:04 - relentless and a lot of entrepreneurs
17:07 - are like that as well
17:08 - they're they're relentless they they
17:10 - they just don't stop they're aggressive
17:13 - they're aggressive and and they just
17:14 - don't they really don't care what people
17:16 - think of them either and that's why
17:17 - they're very very successful they don't
17:19 - give a damn what people think yeah
17:23 - so
17:24 - you got to be the same way as well sorry
17:26 - my stomach's grambling trembling here i
17:28 - got this new ninja bullet thing and i'm
17:30 - it's my new diet here
17:35 - kale blueberries etc gives me energy
17:38 - so you got to ask
17:40 - if you want anything in life you got to
17:42 - ask over and over and over and over and
17:44 - over and over again
17:46 - kind of like michael jordan i feel over
17:48 - and over and over again and that's why i
17:50 - succeed
17:51 - don't forget that please don't forget
17:53 - that you got to ask
17:55 - ask often be a pain in the neck and
17:58 - don't give a damn if you get rejected
18:00 - who gives a damn
18:01 - you know jk rowling she you know she she
18:04 - got rejected by like 29 or 30 publishers
18:07 - she didn't give a damn that people
18:08 - thought she was a failure who cares
18:10 - on the 30th they said yes and she's a
18:12 - billionaire now
18:15 - all right let's move on now to number
18:17 - two um how to get a job and why sending
18:20 - in a resume can be a waste of time there
18:23 - is a better way
18:25 - but even if you have an amazing resume
18:26 - and an amazing linkedin profile it's not
18:28 - enough
18:29 - you're gonna have to network like crazy
18:31 - you're gonna have to do a ton of
18:33 - informational meetings that's how you
18:35 - get jobs in this new digital reality
18:37 - that's just how it works
18:39 - because if you apply online you're one
18:41 - of a thousand people applying for a job
18:43 - and the dude that gets the job is
18:44 - usually the one that knows somebody at
18:47 - the company
18:48 - so and we've covered this a lot before
18:49 - so i'm gonna skip over this one here uh
18:51 - but your your your network is your net
18:53 - your your net worth yeah
18:57 - all right next up is uh business is
18:59 - about people and not about what you know
19:02 - um you know a big rookie mistake is
19:05 - going to any business meeting and just
19:06 - talking about business right away that
19:08 - doesn't matter dude
19:10 - it doesn't matter most jobs in the world
19:12 - are sales
19:14 - and
19:15 - most ceo roles
19:17 - you're a salesperson and if you're a
19:19 - partner in a law firm
19:20 - don't be a part of a law firm but if
19:22 - you're a partner in a law firm uh or or
19:24 - in a venture capital firm you're a sales
19:26 - person as well
19:28 - so how do they do it well they do it by
19:30 - bonding and we've talked a lot about
19:32 - this before bond before business
19:34 - so business is about people
19:36 - and and not what you know it's important
19:38 - to reinforce that
19:40 - now
19:40 - what you have to do also is uh in in i
19:43 - knew a guy
19:44 - who is the head of government sales at
19:47 - ibm in dc
19:49 - and i had um i had dinner with him one
19:52 - night with him and with uh mohit aaron
19:55 - uh who's the founder of a great company
19:56 - called cohisti when i was on mohit's
19:58 - board
19:59 - and uh it was a great it was a great
20:01 - dinner we we had dinner in palo alto and
20:04 - because this dude
20:05 - was at ibm and in a very senior role
20:07 - i asked him you know i said how did you
20:09 - get to where you got
20:11 - and he talked about how he learned a lot
20:13 - from working actually in politics and i
20:16 - said oh what do you mean by that he said
20:18 - well in in the early 90s i worked for
20:21 - george bush senior in the white house
20:24 - and uh i was like oh my gosh this is
20:27 - amazing i got to ask you questions
20:29 - um and so i asked him i said can you
20:31 - please give me
20:33 - the most important lesson you learned
20:35 - from work in the white house for bush
20:36 - senior why was he successful
20:40 - and this guy told me he said it's
20:42 - because uh
20:43 - bush senior would treat people like
20:45 - celebrities and celebrities like people
20:49 - so
20:50 - if if you ever meet a celebrity or
20:52 - somebody very senior in your company
20:54 - just treat like a dream like a normal
20:55 - person they'll feel uncomfortable if you
20:57 - treat me differently
20:59 - and if you meet somebody who's not so
21:01 - important whatever on how you classify
21:03 - what not so important means
21:04 - treat them like a celebrity as well you
21:06 - know ask a lot of questions ask them a
21:08 - lot of questions you know where'd you
21:10 - grow up and that sort of thing and just
21:13 - just learn from them just bond
21:15 - and don't forget to say people's names
21:17 - at least once or twice during during a
21:19 - longer conversation it's more personable
21:21 - that way
21:22 - and after you meet with anybody
21:24 - um connect with them immediately on
21:26 - linkedin as well and just remember their
21:28 - name and while you're going off script
21:29 - here but while you're talking to them
21:31 - what you got to do is
21:33 - you got to visualize and think about
21:36 - how you're going to remember their name
21:38 - and so
21:39 - uh when i was 19 i actually did the dale
21:42 - carnegie public speaking program
21:46 - and
21:47 - there's this woman named uh cynthia
21:50 - mustachio
21:51 - and i met her once there back when i was
21:54 - 19 like
21:55 - ages ago last century
21:58 - and her name was cynthia mustachio but i
22:00 - remember thinking to myself every time i
22:02 - see her i'm going to think she has a big
22:04 - mustache
22:05 - and so that's how i remember cynthia
22:07 - mustachio
22:08 - and you got to do the same thing as well
22:09 - what you can do is you when you when you
22:11 - meet people because it's really
22:12 - embarrassing man like if you go to a a
22:14 - party or something
22:16 - and you forget somebody's name
22:18 - it's embarrassing to just say hey you
22:21 - which is what i do sometimes to be
22:22 - intellectually honest
22:24 - but what i what i do it's awful for me
22:26 - it's the worst for me because my wife's
22:28 - name is the same name as me her name is
22:29 - christine i'm chris
22:31 - so everybody remembers chris and
22:32 - christine
22:34 - and so we go to parties and and i i do
22:36 - this actually this i probably shouldn't
22:38 - tell you this trick i'm going there
22:39 - anywhere i don't care fully transparent
22:41 - as always
22:42 - so if christine is beside me at a party
22:45 - and there's somebody beside me and i
22:46 - have no idea what their name is i forget
22:49 - i go like this i scratch my neck and
22:51 - then christine jumps in and introduces
22:53 - herself
22:54 - and at the end of the night i've lost
22:56 - like eight layers of skin just kidding
22:58 - on my neck yeah but it works but you got
23:00 - to remember people's names and do name
23:02 - association as well
23:04 - if you can and so when you meet somebody
23:06 - if their first name uh is uh similar to
23:10 - a rock star's name or the same as a rock
23:12 - star's name uh then just think of it
23:15 - that way like if you meet somebody named
23:17 - bob
23:18 - um just just think of bob dylan you know
23:20 - singing a song or in an interview saying
23:22 - hey
23:23 - you know you can't really understand it
23:25 - but it's it's silly visualization i get
23:27 - it but you'll never forget it yeah yeah
23:31 - all right
23:32 - all right uh next and and also um
23:37 - not not just rock stars but think of i
23:39 - think of actors as well when you meet
23:41 - somebody or something really really
23:43 - silly really silly like like cynthia
23:45 - mustachio
23:47 - okay moving on
23:49 - all right next up um i want you to meet
23:51 - people have fun and learn and there's no
23:53 - reason why i threw in baby yoda here
23:55 - other than the fact that i think that
23:56 - baby yoda is adorable
23:58 - um
24:00 - no but in all seriousness um
24:03 - when i went down to wall street to work
24:04 - at goldman i was so nervous man i i was
24:08 - nervous because i i thought and i
24:10 - remember that time really well i had
24:12 - nirvana's song in my head dumb
24:15 - nirvana had it
24:16 - one of the early albums it was great
24:18 - there's a song called dumb
24:20 - and it goes i think i'm dumb i think i'm
24:22 - dumb and i remember when i was at
24:23 - goldman i remember thinking to myself
24:26 - if i don't say anything ever to anybody
24:29 - they might think i'm dumb
24:31 - but if i actually open my mouth and
24:33 - start talking they'll know i'm dumb
24:35 - and then the kirk cobain track would go
24:37 - on and on and on in my head
24:39 - perception becomes reality you got to
24:41 - get that out of your mind and so i told
24:43 - myself three things which assuaged my
24:45 - concerns you know when i went down and
24:48 - in hindsight i would have told myself
24:49 - fourth and the fourth thing would have
24:50 - been god already knows what's gonna
24:52 - happen so just don't worry just enjoy it
24:55 - don't question your faith
24:57 - but the three things i told myself at
24:58 - the time when i went down to goldman um
25:01 - was and i and i loved the power of three
25:02 - as you know uh in all my presentations
25:04 - and in everything
25:06 - um
25:07 - you know
25:07 - what i would say was uh i all i want to
25:10 - do is i want to meet people
25:11 - have fun and learn that's it
25:15 - those are my goals
25:17 - that's it
25:18 - and it was great
25:19 - because i met a ton of people my network
25:21 - is amazing partially because of that
25:23 - i enjoyed it i had fun i never saw it as
25:26 - works i conditioned myself to enjoy it i
25:28 - learned a ton and once you stop learning
25:30 - you got to move on to another job
25:33 - so if you're you're ever nervous about a
25:36 - new job
25:37 - don't worry because when you start a
25:38 - brand new job i don't care how old or
25:40 - young you are they're not going to give
25:42 - you like mission critical stuff right
25:43 - away
25:44 - especially when you're younger you know
25:46 - you're not going to show up first day
25:48 - and they're going to say write me a
25:49 - proposal on on if ibm should buy red hat
25:51 - which they already did but you know what
25:53 - i mean
25:54 - um don't worry when you show up you go
25:56 - through a training program or you'll
25:57 - you'll get mentors whatever or you'll
25:59 - photocopy like i did uh which i did with
26:02 - pleasure because i read all the stuff
26:03 - when i was photocopying when i worked at
26:05 - accenture i learned
26:07 - meet people have fun and learn
26:11 - all right next up we've got the

37:26 - watered and nourished with the sweat and
37:28 - tears of hard work
37:31 - humbly rooting the deep soils of
37:32 - discipline and
37:34 - sacrifice this place is not meant for

38:32 - farm
38:34 - [Music]
39:00 - [Music]
39:04 - so i'm very proud and humbled to say
39:06 - that i'm on the board of directors of of
39:09 - the the limo foundation it's an amazing
39:11 - organization um and the founder there
39:15 - david um who has given the speech he's
39:17 - so inspirational he's amazing and
39:20 - i believe that everybody deserves a
39:22 - second chance and he always says that
39:24 - you need to learn
39:26 - earn and then return
39:28 - and i completely believe it and let me
39:30 - tell you a little bit more about david
39:31 - because i think we all do deserve a
39:33 - second chance
39:34 - um so
39:36 - david's brother is is on death row for
39:38 - um
39:39 - for yeah i'm not gonna go there but you
39:42 - can probably guess why
39:43 - and so uh david um he grew up um in east
39:47 - palo alto
39:49 - and east palo alto in america like in
39:51 - america you get really rich area and
39:54 - then kind of a scary neighborhood pretty
39:56 - quickly it's just it's just it's a land
39:59 - of extremes sometimes as much as i love
40:01 - this country
40:02 - but in east palo alto the high school
40:05 - graduation rate is only 40
40:08 - percent and there's there's a lot of
40:11 - deadbeat fathers i don't think there's
40:13 - such thing as a debbie mother
40:16 - uh and so um david actually got a
40:18 - scholarship uh to go to
40:21 - a great school called juniperocera it's
40:23 - a private all-boys school
40:25 - and i was gonna send my kids there as
40:27 - well um
40:29 - and i went to an event there a charity
40:30 - event and he gave a great speech
40:32 - that inspired me and changed my life
40:34 - in in that school there's a lot of
40:37 - athletes there too like
40:39 - greg jeffrey's great baseball player
40:40 - went there so did barry bonds and
40:43 - the best quarterback in history i can't
40:45 - remember his name right now but you guys
40:46 - all know his name
40:48 - um
40:50 - yeah he's dating gisele i think anyway
40:53 - tom brady i think yeah but um
40:56 - when i saw david give a speech there and
40:58 - by the way i decided not to send my kids
40:59 - to that school um i they all go to
41:01 - public school
41:03 - which is the
41:04 - it's i think it's better than prep i
41:06 - won't go there if you won't ask why i'll
41:07 - i'm happy to go there too but but in
41:09 - that that that uh that event uh david
41:11 - was keynote speech speaker
41:13 - um and he said something it changed my
41:15 - life
41:17 - um
41:18 - and he grew up in in east palo alto and
41:20 - got a scholarship to go to that school
41:21 - but he said
41:23 - don't expect
41:25 - to accomplish your dreams in life
41:28 - unless you help others accomplish theirs
41:30 - first
41:32 - let me say that again
41:34 - don't expect to accomplish your dreams
41:36 - in life
41:38 - unless you help others accomplish theirs
41:40 - first
41:41 - i believe in that i really do
41:44 - and and david has turned his life around
41:46 - as well he actually spent time in jail
41:47 - as well for robbing a safeway uh grocery
41:50 - store here when he was a he was a kid
41:52 - everybody deserves a second chance and
41:54 - so what we do in the limo foundation
41:56 - and i've donated a lot of money for
41:58 - scholarships there etc i'll continue to
42:00 - do so
42:01 - is um what we do is the people that work
42:04 - at limo
42:06 - they'll they'll pick up these these kids
42:08 - from
42:09 - really poor areas uh in the morning
42:12 - they'll give them full scholarships to
42:14 - the best private schools
42:16 - the best private schools
42:18 - they'll drive them to school
42:20 - then after school is done so they don't
42:22 - get into trouble doing bad stuff or
42:24 - whatever it is
42:26 - after school is done they'll bring them
42:27 - back to limo headquarters
42:29 - which is close to east palo alto
42:31 - and um
42:33 - they have a sports facility as you saw
42:34 - in that video and a lot of computers as
42:36 - well
42:37 - and then what they'll do is they'll help
42:39 - the students with their homework if they
42:40 - need help then they'll drive them back
42:42 - home by seven or eight o'clock at night
42:44 - and they do this every day every weekday
42:46 - and it's a wonderful thing
42:49 - because
42:50 - you're giving a chance to to all these
42:52 - underprivileged kids from tough
42:55 - backgrounds and i love them to death
42:57 - you know i i love them so much more
42:59 - because they come from a tough
43:00 - background

43:57 - why don't we
43:58 - why don't you let me teach all the limo
44:00 - students on a saturday
44:02 - and and i'll call it um an entire nba
44:05 - one one day
44:06 - and i hand made all these degrees for
44:09 - them and that was at the end of that one
44:11 - day and i gave my book as well now these
44:13 - these kids are great uh and i want to
44:15 - show you this actually this is this is
44:16 - what i want to show you
44:19 - the kids that were there that day
44:21 - they ranged from the ages of of um
44:24 - of nine
44:26 - uh to 17.
44:27 - and we spent 12 hours there and this was
44:29 - actually in longitude capitals venture
44:31 - capital headquarters in menlo park
44:33 - it was uh
44:35 - patrick one of one of the guys on the
44:36 - board let us use his office good dude
44:39 - uh and actually lilika right here um she
44:42 - graduated she she's i think she was at
44:44 - the san francisco art institute after
44:46 - she finished high school and she's on my
44:48 - board as well i'm proud to say and this
44:50 - dude here is nine
44:52 - and the oldest here was 17 at the time
44:55 - and the whole day when i was teaching
44:56 - them and the course is only eight hours
44:58 - on udemy but the version here i made it
45:00 - 12 hours a bit longer
45:02 - and the whole day when i was teaching
45:04 - them this
45:05 - every one of these kids including this
45:07 - dude here who's nine
45:09 - their eyes were wide open all day like
45:11 - they weren't blinking they were just oh
45:12 - my god like somebody's paying attention
45:14 - to me this is awesome their questions
45:15 - were brilliant
45:17 - and what fires me up is getting people
45:20 - that have been given a crappy set of
45:22 - cards in life and helping them achieve
45:24 - their dreams that fires me up that makes
45:26 - me more happy than me accomplishing my
45:28 - own dreams and there's potential in
45:30 - everybody which is why i do what i do
45:33 - and
45:34 - all these kids have gone on to do
45:35 - wonderful things wonderful things so far
45:39 - and you know again this was back in 2016
45:41 - in january
45:42 - and i created these degrees for all of
45:44 - them um yeah i went to an art shop and i
45:47 - bought stickers it was fun and then what
45:50 - happened was this that was on a saturday
45:53 - then on i think it was a sunday i put my
45:55 - course online on on udemy my mba course
45:59 - and i think it might have been by a
46:00 - monday or so that business insider wrote
46:02 - an article that got shared hundreds of
46:04 - thousands of times and it took off it
46:06 - took off
46:07 - uh and it changed my life
46:09 - and
46:11 - everything i do
46:12 - like like teaching all of you
46:14 - the genesis
46:16 - is that day which changed my life right
46:18 - there
46:20 - don't expect to accomplish your dreams
46:21 - until you help others accomplish theirs
46:23 - first i really believe in that
46:26 - and so david said learn earn return just
46:30 - remember that make that the cornerstone
46:32 - of your life as well and your philosophy
46:35 - learn
46:36 - earn return it's simplistic
46:39 - and throughout your life like don't wait
46:40 - until you're worth a fortune to return
46:43 - you know
46:44 - give give time as well
46:46 - and i went to a columbia business school
46:49 - and i remember it was a henry kravis
46:51 - henry kravis is the number one private
46:53 - equity dude in history and um
46:58 - i'll show you i'll show you what it
46:58 - looks like here
47:00 - so he actually uh henry kravis uh
47:03 - there's more pictures of the students
47:05 - there
47:06 - so henry kravis kind of created the
47:08 - private equity market we kind of talked
47:10 - about him a bit when we were doing that
47:11 - that
47:12 - that case study with all the hats with
47:14 - disney a while back
47:16 - uh but um henry kravis
47:19 - he went to columbia and he was a
47:20 - straight c student grades don't matter
47:22 - that's right
47:23 - uh and what he did was he actually um
47:26 - he came to school and i was really
47:28 - excited because i thought that
47:31 - henry kravis was going to talk about
47:33 - deals
47:34 - and i read a great book when i was a kid
47:36 - called barbarians at the gate which
47:38 - talks about how henry kravis and others
47:41 - bought uh
47:42 - nabisco which stands for the national
47:45 - biscuit company took it private made a
47:46 - fortune
47:47 - and so he showed up at columbia one day
47:49 - to lecture and and instead of warren
47:52 - buffett one day too which is cool that
47:53 - he's also an alum there
47:56 - and i couldn't wait to learn about deals
47:59 - and
48:01 - he talked for an hour and a half
48:03 - all he talked about was just
48:06 - not giving money but giving your time of
48:08 - course he donates money too
48:09 - but giving your time
48:11 - uh and and i gained a tremendous amount
48:14 - of respect for him and he's totally
48:15 - right he's totally right you gotta
48:18 - you got to donate your time and do
48:21 - charity work throughout your entire
48:22 - career okay you really really do um and
48:26 - if you give you will get
48:28 - it's prophetic it's true it's been true
48:30 - since being a time
48:31 - you know give and you will receive
48:34 - so just remember that
48:36 - learn
48:37 - earn return
48:39 - and to quote david for the limo
48:40 - foundation before we move on to lesson
48:42 - 11.
48:44 - don't expect to accomplish your goals or
48:46 - dreams in life
48:47 - until you help others accomplish theirs
48:49 - first
48:52 - all right next up is number 11 the
48:55 - harder you work the luckier you get
48:58 - all right and that's of course a
48:59 - four-leaf clover
49:01 - it's true though like you will get a
49:03 - break
49:04 - you will get a break
49:06 - um you know
49:07 - if you're working your ass off and
49:09 - nothing is working out for you in your
49:11 - life
49:12 - nothing
49:13 - just keep at it
49:15 - keep at it you will get a break
49:17 - eventually
49:18 - you know like michael jordan said i
49:19 - failed over and over and over again and
49:21 - that's why i succeed
49:22 - you will get your lucky break i promise
49:25 - you
49:26 - you will one day and you look back and
49:29 - you'll be grateful to god
49:31 - that
49:32 - you had these potential failures or
49:34 - career setbacks early on because it
49:36 - actually guided you down a different
49:38 - path in life you might not understand
49:40 - that now
49:41 - but i promise you will one day i promise
49:43 - you
49:44 - you know years ago i was down and out
49:46 - i did everything right i worked for
49:48 - somebody i made him a fortune
49:50 - um he took all the credits
49:52 - and people loved me on the team
49:54 - and i was probably too good at my job
49:56 - and so yeah you know what he did to me
50:00 - and i remember calling my dad i said dad
50:01 - i don't get it like i work so hard
50:04 - you know and and i try to be a good
50:06 - person
50:07 - i try to give back and mentor and do
50:09 - what i can do and i made the company so
50:11 - much money and this shark
50:14 - you know this this awful person who i'll
50:16 - never name it's just i'll turn the other
50:18 - cheek i guess
50:20 - but i i told my dad about it and he's
50:22 - like chris you won't understand this one
50:24 - day but you'll look back years from now
50:27 - and and you'll be grateful uh that it
50:30 - happened because somehow it set you down
50:32 - a different path
50:33 - i said dad that doesn't make any sense
50:35 - um
50:36 - and i said it respectfully obviously i'm
50:38 - very respectful of my parents
50:40 - and then my dad he said chris what i
50:42 - want you to do is go to the old
50:43 - testament
50:45 - the old testament is kind of the basis
50:46 - for many great religions whatever
50:49 - and he said i want you to read the book
50:50 - of job
50:52 - which is prophetic because jay would be
50:54 - his job it's about this guy that lost
50:57 - everything
50:58 - and he didn't
50:59 - lose his faith
51:01 - and then much much later years later
51:04 - everything worked out for him and he
51:05 - kind of understood why things were the
51:07 - way they were so
51:09 - the harder you work the luckier you get
51:11 - you will get that lucky break okay just
51:13 - remember to keep failing over and over
51:15 - and over again and not giving a damn
51:16 - what anybody thinks
51:18 - and i promise you i promise you i
51:20 - guarantee it
51:22 - you will get your lucky break
51:24 - the harder you work the luckier you get
51:29 - all right next up is the most important
51:31 - investment you will ever make
51:33 - the most important investment you'll
51:34 - ever make is investment in you
51:37 - don't ever be cheap when it comes to
51:39 - education
51:41 - so if if there's a book you want to
51:43 - download or read and you're like i don't
51:44 - know man it's like it's like 10 bucks i
51:46 - don't know if i should
51:48 - don't be cheap
51:50 - just do it
51:52 - you know subscribe to audible.com it's
51:53 - like 10 or 15 bucks a month you can
51:55 - listen to two books every month from i
51:58 - don't know whoever your
52:00 - whoever your inspirations are listen to
52:02 - biographies or autobiographies on
52:04 - successful people they share their
52:06 - blueprint with you they give give give
52:08 - give gift
52:09 - you know they put they let their cards
52:11 - be seen by everybody because they've
52:12 - already made it and a lot of people that
52:14 - are very very successful
52:16 - the reason they were successful or
52:18 - became successful is because they gave
52:20 - remember in the first couple classes we
52:22 - talked about that book give and take
52:24 - and how the richest 1 people in the
52:27 - world
52:28 - you know are our givers
52:30 - the middle 98 percenter takers
52:32 - and the poorest one percent of my
52:33 - favorite uh the mother teresa's of the
52:35 - world that were
52:37 - never concerned about making money
52:38 - whatever yeah
52:40 - it's so funny though because
52:42 - it's coming full circle now but mother
52:44 - teresa
52:45 - there's this guy
52:46 - that went to that school sarah that
52:49 - david from the limo foundation went to
52:51 - and so the first year i went to that
52:53 - that charity event at limo or a party at
52:55 - sarah and i saw dave give that speech
52:58 - where he said don't expect to accomplish
53:00 - your goals or dreams until you help
53:02 - others accomplish theirs first
53:03 - the second year i went back as well as
53:05 - another charity event and i donated
53:06 - again i didn't send my kids to private
53:07 - school because i think public school is
53:09 - better better
53:11 - but the second year when i was there the
53:13 - guy that gave the keynotes
53:15 - and it was a tough act to follow because
53:16 - david's amazing
53:18 - the guy that gave the keynote was a guy
53:19 - that went to sarah as well who was um
53:23 - who was mother teresa's photographer
53:26 - so um and and he showed us some
53:28 - wonderful pictures i got to show you
53:30 - something give me i'm going off script i
53:31 - i don't give a damn um i'm gonna
53:34 - stand up here in my my lululemon sweats
53:37 - uh and walk around and find something to
53:39 - show you
53:42 - i almost fell down there but i'm okay
53:46 - all right um
53:51 - here it is
53:53 - see if it's in the picture i think it is
53:55 - um mother teresa said peace begins with
53:58 - a smile
54:00 - i love that it's so true
54:03 - it's so true
54:04 - peace does begin with a smile i i love
54:06 - her to death lover did that somebody's
54:08 - got to make a great movie about her
54:09 - she's
54:10 - probably my probably one of my favorite
54:12 - people that ever ever walked this great
54:14 - earth i'm so humbled to say i walked
54:15 - this earth at the same time she did i
54:17 - never got to meet her yeah but but she's
54:19 - wonderful she's wonderful and i'll put
54:21 - this up here actually
54:23 - yeah actually i'll put it right here so
54:25 - you can see both quotes
54:27 - okay
54:29 - all right
54:31 - and this here by the way if you're
54:32 - curious is how um we can tell if the the
54:35 - color is correct when we go into post
54:38 - edit so i have it face every single
54:40 - camera
54:41 - just to make sure that the color matches
54:43 - because when i change the colors behind
54:44 - me it messes up the pigment of my skin
54:46 - sometimes yeah yeah yeah
54:49 - all right
54:50 - because in some videos i look like ernie
54:54 - or bert
54:56 - all right
54:59 - all right next next up is um

55:04 - important investment you'll ever make
55:06 - it's an investment in you um education
55:09 - always always always don't ever be cheap
55:11 - when it comes to education if your dream
55:13 - was to go to i don't know yale medical
55:16 - school
55:17 - um and you know yeah
55:20 - you're worried about the money
55:22 - don't be just get in first and then
55:23 - figure it out you'll figure it out
55:25 - i actually
55:27 - there's this one guy i was friends with
55:28 - growing up and his mom used to always
55:30 - brag about him yeah and and his name was
55:33 - uh was was rick
55:35 - uh and
55:36 - he got into yale and his mom was
55:38 - bragging
55:39 - saying uh you know you know my son
55:43 - he got into jail
55:47 - so if your goal is to go to jail or or
55:48 - yale
55:49 - uh then um but but the money's an issue
55:52 - just get in first and you you get a
55:54 - scholarship you'll figure it out
55:55 - if you want something bad enough in life
55:56 - you'll always figure it out always
55:58 - figure it out but when it comes to
55:59 - smaller things
56:00 - in life like you know buying a book for
56:02 - education if you're on the fence just
56:04 - buy it dude
56:06 - just do it just do it don't be cheap
56:07 - when it comes to
56:09 - investing in yourself it's the best
56:10 - investment you'll ever make in yourself
56:13 - all right next up we've got uh learn
56:16 - what not to do
56:18 - um and i had so much fun creating these
56:20 - graphics here
56:21 - uh and and i was that guy that
56:24 - didn't watch game of thrones for years
56:26 - because i tried and then my kids were
56:28 - around so i'd have to turn it off and i
56:30 - try again later and there's eight
56:31 - million different characters and i just
56:32 - couldn't keep up there's too many
56:34 - characters man it's complicated eh
56:37 - uh and so uh i included that the bad
56:39 - dude there um
56:42 - something walker ice walker or something
56:44 - yeah bad guy and i show him because i i
56:48 - worked
56:49 - for people
56:50 - that
56:51 - should not be managing people they're
56:53 - they're awful awful people to work for
56:57 - and i did learn from them because i
56:58 - learned
56:59 - what not to do
57:02 - and so my attitude could have been
57:03 - negative forever
57:04 - but i told myself you know what
57:07 - two things number one i'm learning how
57:09 - not to treat people
57:11 - and number two
57:12 - this guy's such a jerk
57:14 - that he's actually helping me because
57:16 - he's motivating me
57:18 - to you know
57:19 - work hard on getting a better job and
57:21 - improve myself so i'm never complacent
57:24 - so when you work for other people learn
57:27 - what not to do
57:28 - as much as possible as much as possible
57:31 - all right i think i'm going to take that
57:32 - down because i'm not sure about the
57:33 - glare i think it's fine but it might
57:35 - mess things up here but just remember
57:37 - peace begins with it with a smile yeah
57:39 - and i've got this great quote here which
57:41 - which i used to use in a lot of my
57:43 - keynotes
57:45 - um
57:46 - and it's from a great poet american poet
57:49 - um
57:50 - a real renaissance man actually
57:52 - um and he lived here in san francisco
57:54 - for a while his name is mark twain uh
57:56 - and a lot of people don't realize that
57:58 - san francisco although it's california
58:00 - is not warm
58:02 - you know it's cold especially in the
58:03 - summer the warm season's the fall
58:05 - and so mark twain once said the coldest
58:08 - winter i ever spent was a summer in san
58:12 - francisco
58:13 - but mark twain also said
58:16 - the two most important days in your life
58:18 - are number one the day you're born
58:22 - and number two the day you find out why
58:25 - and hopefully through the soul-searching
58:27 - process of this entire mba degree
58:30 - including today's class next class on
58:32 - 101 crucial lessons my book hopefully
58:34 - that will help you to find your why

62:36 - there's no end of quote there or the end
62:38 - of bracket at the end there but that's
62:39 - good enough i'm going to leave it here
62:41 - because i want to prove a point that
62:43 - you'll never accomplish anything in life
62:45 - if you try to be a perfectionist okay if
62:48 - if you want to
62:49 - don't be a perfectionist if you want to
62:50 - vlog or blog or create some sort of
62:53 - youtube video
62:54 - and what's holding you back is you don't
62:55 - publish it because it's not perfect and
62:57 - you care what people are going to think
62:58 - screw it just do it as sir richard
63:01 - branson says screw it let's do it so i'm
63:03 - going to leave that that parenthesis oh
63:04 - my god i talk a lot i'm going to leave
63:06 - that parenthesis or close bracket out of
63:07 - it there so avoid burnout is section 3.
63:10 - and it is getting hot in here
63:12 - speaking of matches
63:14 - all right so uh lesson 14 is what to do
63:17 - the second you return from vacation
63:20 - and i worked when i was at goldman years
63:22 - ago one of my clients uh rhonda chang
63:25 - just a brilliant woman that worked at
63:27 - manulife which is a big insurance
63:28 - company that's canadian most people
63:30 - don't realize that
63:31 - and i was kind of stressed out and she
63:33 - said chris let me give you some advice
63:35 - and of course i didn't take her advice
63:37 - but i listened to it
63:39 - her advice was this the second you come
63:42 - back from vacation
63:44 - what i want you to do is i want you to
63:46 - open up your calendar
63:48 - and
63:49 - book your next vacation six months out
63:51 - that's the first thing you should do
63:53 - when you come back from vacation open
63:54 - your calendar and book your next
63:56 - vacation six months out otherwise you
63:58 - will burn out you will burn out yeah so
64:01 - it's um
64:03 - and it's i i gotta keep remembering this
64:05 - too so the second you return from
64:07 - vacation i want you to book your next
64:09 - vacation
64:11 - all right next up is uh stress will kill
64:14 - you don't be the gazelle
64:16 - i was watching national geographic years
64:18 - ago
64:19 - and it was this poor gazelle being
64:21 - chased uh by by by a a i think it was a
64:25 - cheetah or a tiger i can't remember
64:28 - and
64:29 - the gazelle was not caught thank
64:30 - goodness
64:31 - but national geographic put sensors on
64:34 - the gazelle to monitor the gazelles
64:36 - heart rates and other bodily functions
64:39 - and what happened was this
64:41 - the gazelle was running for their for
64:43 - the for its life
64:44 - and so obviously the heart was pumping
64:46 - really fast you know pumping quickly
64:47 - getting as much blood as possible you
64:49 - know circling around the body
64:52 - and what happened was the heart and the
64:54 - mind
64:55 - focused entirely on survival
64:58 - and as a result
65:00 - the heart and the mind i guess somehow
65:03 - shut down the immune system while the
65:05 - the gazelle was running
65:07 - running for its life and the heart and
65:09 - the mind
65:10 - also shut down the reproductive system
65:14 - and the gazelle aged a bit when it was
65:17 - being chased as well
65:19 - so the reproduction of functions shut
65:21 - down
65:22 - it aged faster
65:24 - and also it could get sick quicker
65:26 - because
65:28 - all the heart and mind was focused on
65:29 - was pumping more blood
65:31 - and surviving that's stress stress can
65:34 - kill you and so the only reason we're
65:37 - supposed to feel stressed like that in
65:39 - our lives
65:41 - is if you know going back to caveman
65:43 - times or whatever you're being chased by
65:45 - a dinosaur or whatever it is somebody
65:48 - that wants to take your life that's when
65:50 - you feel stress
65:52 - not all the time at work
65:54 - a lot of times stress is up here
65:58 - you know i i
65:59 - i feel stressed probably because i'm
66:01 - making myself stressed so don't be the
66:03 - gazelle just chill out man
66:07 - and what happens is conceiving having a
66:09 - baby is not it's not as easy as most
66:12 - people think
66:13 - um that that haven't had kids before
66:15 - you know we're we're very blessed that
66:17 - you know christine and i got pregnant
66:18 - pretty quickly with with all three three
66:20 - boys we wanted to have a daughter as
66:22 - well and usually people that have two
66:24 - kids have a girl and a boy and they're
66:25 - done
66:26 - um but anyway i love all three of my
66:29 - boys the same um but if we had a
66:31 - daughter be it'd be it'd be awesome too
66:33 - it'd be awesome too
66:34 - wholly off topic but a lot of people
66:37 - when they're trying to conceive trying
66:38 - to have a child it's so stressful
66:41 - and i remember for christine and i too
66:42 - the first time we want to have a kid
66:45 - there was a pregnancy test she bought it
66:47 - and the second i we found out she wasn't
66:50 - i was like damn it it was stressful
66:53 - you know because it's why are we here
66:55 - you know it says it's
66:57 - kids that's one of the reasons the why
66:59 - right but and then eventually obviously
67:01 - things worked out great for us
67:02 - but we have friends that have tried
67:04 - everything in vitro spending a gazillion
67:07 - dollars whatever trying to have kids and
67:09 - it's so stressful in their marriage and
67:11 - then they they conclude that
67:13 - maybe we just can't get pregnant
67:16 - and they do something wonderful they
67:18 - adopt
67:20 - adoption's a beautiful thing
67:22 - and then what happens is after they
67:24 - adopt this happens a lot
67:26 - a couple months later they get pregnant
67:29 - naturally
67:30 - because they weren't feeling stress
67:32 - don't be the gazelle please
67:35 - don't be the gazelle just
67:37 - just chill out it's all up here a lot of
67:40 - the stress you're doing it to yourself
67:42 - you're doing it to yourself
67:44 - it's all up here perception becomes
67:46 - reality
67:48 - so just condition yourself
67:51 - not to be stressed
67:53 - and maybe what you do every day is
67:55 - let me go back here
67:58 - every day on on your daily sheet here
68:01 - you do what i do which is when i wake up
68:03 - in the morning
68:04 - the first thing i do is um well i say
68:06 - prayer but i also thank god for 10
68:08 - different things
68:10 - maybe what you do is part of your your
68:12 - daily sheet here you you can change this
68:15 - if you want to and at the end of today's
68:17 - lecture i'm going to remind you where to
68:19 - go get this and how to change this in
68:20 - powerpoint or other programs but you can
68:23 - change it so that this is your gratitude
68:24 - section here so you write down what your
68:27 - gratitude about or get rid of that
68:29 - section and have a gratitude section
68:30 - whatever it is along with writing your
68:32 - goals and your schedule for the next day
68:33 - as well okay
68:36 - don't be the gazelle please
68:40 - all right
68:42 - avoid burnout avoid burnout yeah
68:45 - all right next up we have got um when to
68:48 - take a day off when you are not sick
68:50 - this is important dude so
68:53 - are you ever kind of in a bad mooc
68:55 - because you're kind of i don't know
68:55 - you're kind of stressed at work and
68:58 - you didn't get enough sleep whatever and
69:00 - things aren't going that great at home
69:02 - temporarily
69:03 - and so
69:05 - you're not feeling great mentally
69:06 - physically you're fine
69:08 - but you go to work
69:10 - and you go to work and
69:12 - you might
69:14 - not be as nice as always
69:18 - put it mildly
69:19 - or you might be a little bit cold to
69:21 - somebody at work
69:23 - or you might be
69:25 - you're supposed to give a presentation
69:26 - and
69:28 - a lot of important people are around and
69:29 - you just
69:30 - stressed out
69:32 - man you should never have shown up to
69:35 - work that day to begin with
69:38 - and so i think it's important to take at
69:40 - least one or two days off a year
69:43 - when physically you're not sick
69:45 - but mentally you're not all there
69:50 - it's important
69:52 - and
69:53 - you can tell people you're sick because
69:54 - you are
69:55 - you know
69:56 - you're mentally kind of just feeling
69:57 - burned out
69:59 - it's a great investment to make yourself
70:01 - and i made this red the bottle here red
70:03 - on purpose uh supposed to be pills
70:06 - um
70:07 - it looks like it's clothing red on the
70:09 - outside i put the wrong thing on it
70:10 - whatever but but it on purpose to make a
70:12 - point just it's a sense of urgency when
70:15 - you're mentally drained
70:17 - do not
70:19 - whatever you do do not go to work that
70:21 - day
70:22 - whatever you do is going to hurt you
70:24 - more than help you
70:27 - all rights
70:28 - lord oh this is the ten commandments
70:30 - these laws
70:32 - unto thy people
70:34 - hear me
70:35 - oh hear me
70:37 - all pay heed
70:39 - the lord the lord jehovah has given unto
70:43 - you these fifteen
70:46 - like
70:48 - ten ten commandments for all to obey
70:55 - i love that that was one of the first
70:56 - movies i ever saw uh when i was a kid it
70:58 - was called history of the world part one
71:00 - uh by mel brooks and my dad took me the
71:03 - movie i don't think he realized it was
71:04 - gonna be
71:06 - some parts weren't supposed to be
71:07 - supposed to be shown to kids but that
71:08 - was before uh indiana jones in the
71:10 - temple of doom came out in 82 or 83
71:13 - because that movie indiana jones off
71:15 - script whatever
71:16 - indiana jones in the temple of doom that
71:18 - was the
71:20 - that was the first movie that was um
71:22 - uh that that that should not have been
71:25 - pg it should have been a a which they
71:27 - got rid of and so because of temple of
71:29 - doom they created something called pg-13
71:32 - which is another category of of of
71:34 - raiding movies but that was uh that was
71:36 - uh mel brooks obviously very very funny
71:38 - man um and so i i
71:41 - i bring up the ten commandments it's not
71:43 - a religious thing here but um you know
71:45 - those ten rules are the basis for a lot
71:47 - of laws in in many wonderful countries
71:50 - and the basis for a lot of religions too
71:52 - but
71:53 - when those 10 rules were made thousands
71:55 - of years ago
71:57 - one they they knew our four mothers and
71:59 - forefathers that we need to take time
72:02 - off or we'll burn out it's human nature
72:04 - which hasn't changed in thousands of
72:06 - years and you know
72:09 - the rule is to
72:11 - rest on the sunday or saturday or
72:13 - whatever it is just one day a week
72:15 - one day a week
72:17 - you got to take off that one day a week
72:19 - at least
72:21 - and spend time with your family uh and
72:24 - you know just get
72:25 - just just focus on getting yourself
72:27 - centered so to speak get outside your
72:28 - body and kind of take a look uh
72:31 - see the forest from the trees
72:33 - um where are you in your life and what
72:35 - are you here for anyway and you know
72:37 - what what what's your why what's your
72:39 - long-term goals are you happy at work in
72:41 - your relationships whatever
72:43 - um are you bonding enough with your kids
72:45 - because by the time your kids are 13
72:47 - years old you've already are 12 years
72:49 - old
72:50 - you've already spent 90 of the time
72:52 - you'll ever spend with them so just
72:54 - that's precious man like screw work
72:57 - if you can every now and then you know
72:59 - just
73:00 - skip work to go to mommy or daddy daddy
73:04 - child breakfast day at school because i
73:07 - missed andrews years ago
73:09 - and i don't know why i must have had an
73:11 - important meeting that was so important
73:12 - i can't remember it today but i do
73:14 - remember missing andrew daddy day at
73:16 - breakfast at school um so anyway
73:20 - you can't get that time back and take as
73:21 - many pictures as you can too before your
73:23 - kids get old just savor every second
73:25 - because they go fast man
73:27 - and
73:28 - my third son dylan my youngest son he
73:31 - said dad
73:32 - why is it
73:34 - there's not as many pictures of me as
73:36 - there are from my older brothers andrew
73:38 - matthew

79:58 - let's move on to topic number four
80:01 - so topic number four is called create
80:04 - off the charts confidence wear that
80:06 - superman cape
80:08 - uh and at the top there it says
80:10 - crucial confidence lessons to help your
80:13 - career take off i love this section i
80:15 - love this section because
80:17 - confidence is entirely up here it's a
80:20 - light switch just flick it on just flick
80:23 - it on okay
80:25 - all right
80:26 - so
80:27 - the first lesson that we're going to
80:28 - talk about here
80:30 - in section number four is that
80:33 - there are no limits
80:35 - there are no limits and that's a ford
80:37 - mustang down there because
80:39 - henry ford said
80:41 - um whether or not you think you can do
80:43 - it
80:44 - you are right let me say that again
80:47 - whether or not you think you can do it
80:50 - you are right
80:52 - it's all up here i know it sounds so
80:55 - simplistic
80:56 - so simplistic
80:58 - but confidence is merely a light switch
81:02 - so just remember the past does not equal
81:04 - the future
81:06 - so
81:07 - if something brings you down confidence
81:09 - wise it never happened
81:12 - erase it from your mind or at least
81:13 - don't think about it at all
81:15 - whether or not you think you can do it
81:17 - you're right it's all up here there are
81:19 - no limits except the limits that we set
81:22 - for ourselves
81:24 - okay number 19 is the glass is
81:27 - always full always full and for those
81:30 - you're not familiar with that term
81:32 - there's a saying that
81:33 - if somebody sees a glass that's that has
81:36 - water up to the halfway mark
81:37 - negative people will say the glasses
81:39 - have empty and positive people will say
81:41 - no the glass is half full
81:43 - so perception becomes reality you know
81:45 - it's like the rodan sculpture i think
81:47 - therefore i am
81:49 - and so this glass here um is not
81:52 - half full
81:53 - it's it's overflowing in my mind
81:57 - and people think that i'm naively
81:59 - positive
82:00 - but i think the most positive people in
82:01 - the world are the only ones that can
82:03 - change the world okay i think all of you
82:05 - if you're very positive you can put your
82:08 - dent in the universe and change the
82:09 - world as well so i got to be careful
82:11 - because this thing is really overflowing
82:13 - whoa
82:15 - all right the glass is not half half
82:17 - full it's overflowing my cup overfloweth
82:21 - with optimism
82:24 - all right next up we have got um a
82:26 - balanced life means a more it means
82:29 - you're more productive
82:30 - in business
82:32 - um
82:33 - and we talked about this before so i
82:34 - don't go into much
82:35 - too much detail on that but
82:37 - you know there's there are many people
82:39 - in life that are incredibly well-rounded
82:41 - you know they they're in great shape
82:42 - they have a great family life
82:44 - um you know they've got a great social
82:47 - life they do well at work
82:49 - uh they're happy because they're
82:50 - balanced because they're balanced um and
82:53 - so if you're balanced and if you take
82:56 - your breaks as well i mean take that one
82:57 - day off per week uh then you'll be much
83:00 - more successful as well let me go i want

84:11 - um you know although you might not think
84:14 - you're confident and you might think you
84:16 - don't look confident when you're up
84:17 - there on the stage in front of the world
84:20 - when you feel nervous you don't look or
84:22 - sound nervous don't worry about it don't
84:25 - worry about it and who gives a when
84:27 - anybody thinks you anyway
84:29 - i don't care that's what you got to tell
84:31 - yourself
84:33 - okay luigi
84:36 - all right next up uh we've got avoid
84:38 - those people okay and i had to have
84:41 - another video game
84:42 - uh reference here not just nintendo but
84:45 - this here is for i guess ps4 and an xbox
84:48 - uh that's a character who i'm
84:50 - embarrassed to say is canadian in the
84:51 - game his name is trevor he's a bad bad
84:54 - person
84:56 - and he is from grand theft auto 5.
85:00 - and i'm smiling because in one scene he
85:02 - has a canadian accent as he takes on the
85:03 - u.s military it's a little bit funny but
85:06 - he's a bad dude
85:08 - and you got to avoid those people
85:11 - and when i say those people i mean
85:12 - anybody that that hurts your confidence
85:15 - or brings you down
85:17 - you know you're you're
85:18 - you're not a tree you can move
85:20 - move away from these people cut them out
85:22 - of your life that's right
85:24 - that's right get them out of your life
85:27 - you know if you've got a little bird on
85:28 - your shoulder
85:29 - um or a devil or whatever it is saying
85:32 - you're not good enough you're not good
85:33 - enough you're not good enough
85:36 - get rid of that person get it out of
85:37 - your life
85:38 - get that person out of your life so
85:41 - avoid those people
85:43 - and go with your gut your gut is always
85:45 - right you know when you're a lot younger
85:48 - like i was it was you know 10 strikes
85:50 - you're out now it's one strike you're
85:52 - out or maybe two sometimes
85:55 - but just avoid anybody in your life that
85:56 - makes you unhappy
85:58 - get them out of your life
86:00 - you know get them out of your mind
86:03 - they don't own you they can't control
86:04 - you
86:06 - get rid of them that's right
86:08 - change your environment you'll change
86:10 - your life as well somebody brings you
86:11 - down just get rid of them man get rid of
86:14 - them so anyway
86:16 - see you trevor
86:19 - all right
86:21 - all right this
86:22 - number 23 is that person speaks gooder
86:26 - than me and he's supposed to have
86:27 - glasses there i think i cut them off and
86:28 - i was trying to get rid of the
86:29 - transparent background there yeah
86:32 - so
86:32 - don't ever get intimidated
86:35 - by people that
86:37 - you think might have a better vocabulary
86:39 - than you
86:40 - or people that might have a different
86:42 - accent than you
86:44 - don't be intimidated by them
86:47 - because a lot of times the reason why
86:49 - they might be well spoken
86:51 - is because they're very arrogant
86:54 - or maybe they went to a great school
86:56 - because their parents went there and
86:58 - it's legacy that's how they got in
87:01 - just because somebody sounds
87:04 - confident or arrogant
87:07 - don't let the perception be that that
87:09 - fools you that they're right
87:11 - uh or more often
87:13 - right than you are
87:14 - you know confidence does not lead
87:17 - to uh to competence it might lead to
87:20 - perceived competence
87:21 - but not confidence in general so don't
87:23 - don't ever get intimidated by anybody
87:25 - that that speaks gooder than you at all
87:28 - has nothing to do with success in life
87:31 - it just bring you know it might have
87:32 - something to do with they were born with
87:34 - a silver spoon in their mouth
87:36 - and and i'd rather not hire somebody
87:38 - that was born with a silver spoon in
87:39 - their mouth
87:40 - because they're entitled i want somebody
87:42 - that's poor smart and hungry or somebody
87:44 - that's humble that's important to me so
87:47 - don't ever get intimidated by that and
87:49 - my dad actually he uh when he immigrated
87:51 - from from egypt uh to and i didn't know
87:53 - my dad had an accident until i was like
87:55 - 20 or so or 19 or 18 when i moved out
87:58 - um he sounds a bit like james earl jones
88:01 - uh this is cnn or or simba's father or
88:04 - whatever
88:05 - um but but i remember my dad told me
88:06 - when he first moved to canada it was
88:08 - really frustrating because he had to
88:10 - support himself by by he immigrated in
88:12 - 1967 he left egypt
88:15 - and he bribed an army official
88:17 - to get him to fail the eye exam for the
88:20 - crazy
88:21 - army or whatever was some stupid war in
88:23 - the middle east in 67.
88:25 - so my dad came to canada and in order to
88:29 - pay for himself here support himself
88:31 - before he met my mama
88:33 - um he uh he worked in a hospital
88:35 - cleaning test tubes and the nurses would
88:37 - all make fun of him uh because of his
88:40 - accent and he couldn't speak the
88:41 - language that well
88:43 - uh and uh
88:44 - you know he he could have just kind of
88:47 - given up
88:48 - uh or or just kind of accepted it and
88:50 - had it killed his confidence
88:52 - but uh
88:54 - he didn't he channeled that frustration
88:56 - uh and started his own company and so in
88:58 - hindsight i'm sure he's happy uh that uh
89:01 - that that happened yeah yeah so anyway
89:05 - and then he met my mama my mom is
89:07 - actually was a nurse or she isn't yeah
89:08 - she's still alive she she was a nurse
89:11 - and my dad's pickup line was uh
89:13 - jackie do you have a tylenol he asked my
89:15 - mom for tylenol my dad's a doctor yeah
89:18 - so anyway we love you dada
89:21 - so don't get intimidated by anybody with
89:23 - a different accent or someone speaks
89:24 - gooder than you because they're probably
89:26 - entitled dude and
89:27 - you peel back the onion a couple layers
89:29 - and they're nothing compared to you
89:32 - all right um and just remember number 24
89:36 - is
89:36 - nobody is smarter than you
89:39 - okay and
89:41 - in the book i i think i put a a link to
89:44 - um let's go here to number 24. it's
89:47 - lesson
89:48 - number 24.
89:50 - yeah here it is here
89:52 - yeah i have a link here to a a short
89:54 - video from steve jobs that will change
89:56 - your life it's like a minute or two long
89:58 - um
89:59 - how nobody is smarter than you and once
90:02 - you realize that i'm not telling you to
90:03 - be arrogant but once you realize that
90:05 - you're money you know i i believe you
90:07 - and i believe in you
90:09 - once you believe in yourself
90:12 - you'll never be the same you'll never be
90:14 - the same because you'll be able to
90:15 - accomplish anything you want to in life
90:17 - just remember that nobody is smarter
90:19 - than you okay
90:21 - just remember that confidence is
90:23 - everything dude it's everything
90:26 - everything
90:27 - like i remember when i grew up in canada
90:32 - and um i was kind of reserved a little
90:34 - shy canadian
90:35 - uh humble proud of my roots um and i
90:38 - remember it was it was the 80s
90:41 - and
90:42 - ronald reagan was my hero
90:44 - and i remember though that the
90:47 - the cover of newsweek and time magazine
90:50 - at the time was the downfall of the
90:51 - american student
90:53 - and how the american student is 50th in
90:55 - the world of math and 50th in the world
90:57 - in science it's a downfall of the
90:58 - american student
91:00 - and every couple of years you see the
91:01 - same stupid headlines americans are 25th
91:04 - or 50th in math whatever sciences
91:06 - it doesn't matter
91:08 - and i learned something when i started
91:10 - um
91:13 - when i started teaching here
91:15 - during the evenings years ago
91:18 - in the san francisco bay area and about
91:21 - 50 percent of my students at least were
91:23 - born overseas okay so this is not an
91:25 - american thing what i'm about to say
91:27 - but yeah about 50 percent of my students
91:29 - and about 50 percent of people live here
91:31 - in the bay area and about 50 of the
91:33 - founders in the bay area and about 50
91:34 - percent of the engineers here in the bay
91:36 - area were born overseas you know people
91:38 - like pierre omidjar the wonderful
91:40 - humanitarian he's uh he's he's person
91:42 - he's from iran and of course he founded
91:45 - ebay you got elon musk who splits his
91:47 - time uh between here actually owns a
91:49 - house not too far away from me now here
91:50 - in hillsborough uh he splits his time
91:52 - between here in southern california but
91:54 - but elon musk
91:56 - who also lived in canada for years but
91:59 - but he's from south africa yeah you got
92:01 - um
92:03 - sergey brin and one of the brilliant
92:05 - co-founders of uh
92:07 - of google was born in russia
92:10 - um so you've got this this beautiful
92:12 - cross-cultural diversity here in the bay
92:14 - area but one thing i discovered when i
92:16 - started teaching here is that
92:19 - american students
92:22 - american students
92:24 - whether or not you're born in america
92:25 - doesn't matter but american students are
92:27 - number one in the world in the most
92:29 - important economic category
92:31 - that nobody talks about
92:33 - and that category is confidence
92:36 - you know with confidence comes the
92:37 - ability to sell
92:39 - sell a dream like like like like tucker
92:41 - does and there's the car version over
92:43 - here yeah
92:44 - um
92:45 - with confidence comes the ability to
92:47 - make something boring that's virtual
92:50 - that you can't see feel or touch like
92:51 - cloud software sound exciting think
92:54 - about it think how boring cloud software
92:56 - is
92:57 - dude it's boring you can't see it it's
92:59 - up there somewhere in the cloud it's
93:00 - elusive whatever
93:02 - but you've got these great entrepreneurs
93:03 - out there that sell it
93:05 - and they make a killing
93:06 - because they come across as confidence
93:08 - when they're delivering
93:10 - so confidence leads to
93:13 - at least
93:14 - to competent sometimes too not over
93:16 - being overconfident and of course
93:18 - i know that
93:20 - talking about the american angle some
93:21 - people overseas might think that's
93:23 - arrogance
93:24 - it's it's that's not what i'm getting at
93:27 - it's not like i've got to do a joke now
93:28 - here we go this is awful kids
93:31 - my american students are going to hate
93:32 - me but i'm american now so i'm allowed
93:34 - to do this
93:35 - how does an american screw in a light
93:37 - bulb oh my god i'm going to regret
93:38 - saying this i'm just one dumb comment
93:40 - away from just
93:41 - everybody hating me
93:43 - well here in america me as an american i
93:45 - hold a light bulb and the whole world
93:47 - spins around me
93:49 - okay i'm totally i'm totally kidding oh
93:51 - my god i've alienated my students i'm
93:53 - totally i love all of you okay i'm
93:55 - joking joking okay how does a a a dumb
93:58 - canadian me screwing a light bulb i hold
94:00 - it up there you go okay we're good now
94:01 - we're good
94:02 - but confidence uh it can be borderline
94:05 - arrogant sometimes you got to keep your
94:06 - confidence in check or just remember
94:08 - your humble roots and like steve jobs
94:10 - said you know stay foolish stay humble
94:14 - i i should i have to i should probably
94:16 - edit that out but f and i'm not going to

94:26 - of american whether or not they were
94:27 - born in this country okay american
94:29 - students
94:30 - um see american students that were born
94:32 - overseas they also think they can hold a
94:33 - light bulb up okay
94:35 - but american students are number one
94:37 - in the world the most important economic
94:38 - category which is confidence which which
94:40 - lets you sell
94:41 - because a great entrepreneur great ceo
94:43 - etc they're great sales people
94:45 - i'm gonna shut the hell up but now about

98:36 - crucial ethics lessons to keep you out
98:38 - of trouble
98:40 - okay
98:41 - so the first one is number 25 which is
98:44 - transparency builds trust i really
98:46 - believe this you can lose your
98:47 - reputation really quickly in business
98:49 - and in life
98:51 - but if you're fully transparent uh then
98:53 - this will this will help your career a
98:55 - lot
98:56 - uh and what i mean by that is you always
98:58 - list the risks with with like remember
99:00 - we look through the uh the s ones for
99:02 - facebook goldman et cetera whatever and
99:05 - and there's a lot of risks you gotta be
99:06 - transparent and list all the risks and
99:08 - whenever you're selling something to
99:09 - somebody else you gotta tell yourself i
99:12 - feel comfortable selling this to my
99:13 - parents because i would tell my parents
99:15 - the risks as well so you gotta disclose
99:17 - all risk and that that is abraham
99:19 - lincoln right there honest abe
99:21 - uh and he was very very transparent as
99:24 - well and apparently a very good man yeah
99:26 - so that's that's honest honest abe uh or
99:29 - as wayne and garth and wayne's world
99:30 - referred him as babraham lincoln
99:34 - i don't know what that means
99:35 - but anyway uh transparency builds trust
99:37 - remember that always disclose risks um
99:40 - and the most important risk within the
99:42 - first within the first couple minutes of
99:43 - pitching any idea
99:45 - uh or or uh product or service or
99:48 - whatever it is or if you're trying to
99:49 - raise money
99:50 - because it'll make you come across as
99:52 - being you know more ethical too and you
99:53 - know what dude it might be a litigation
99:55 - issue if you don't disclose them uh and
99:58 - never sell a financial product or raise
100:00 - money without getting a lawyer to write
100:01 - your documents first because the lawyer
100:03 - will make sure that you're you know the
100:05 - risks are disclosed yeah transparency
100:08 - builds trust
100:11 - all right next up is don't trust this
100:14 - type of person here
100:16 - so
100:18 - what am i talking about here well well
100:19 - this type of person
100:21 - is the type of person that backstabs
100:24 - other people
100:26 - and if
100:28 - at work or at school or whatever
100:30 - somebody is gossiping and we all will
100:32 - enjoy gossip for whatever stupid reason
100:34 - right otherwise don't watch tmz
100:37 - um i'm a lawyer i don't know if you guys
100:39 - watch the show but whatever uh but but
100:41 - don't don't trust anybody that that
100:43 - gossips
100:45 - because and don't take part in yourself
100:48 - uh because like around the water
100:50 - fountain or water cooler at work
100:52 - whatever
100:53 - because those people that are
100:55 - gossiping about others they'll gospel at
100:57 - you as well
100:58 - they will
100:59 - and the worst type of person is the
101:00 - person that cheats on their
101:02 - spouse it's a sacred bond man
101:05 - you know if they cheat on their spouse
101:07 - of course they're gonna cheat you cheat
101:09 - you in business as well you can't trust
101:11 - them
101:14 - it's like somebody that backstabs their
101:15 - spouse to
101:16 - you of course you're going to backstab
101:19 - you
101:20 - about you to somebody else
101:22 - you can't trust these people
101:24 - you can't trust them so just just be
101:26 - careful just be careful there's a shadow
101:28 - yeah
101:30 - all right so just don't trust that type
101:32 - of person and don't get involved in
101:33 - gossip either uh and on wall street
101:36 - you know if if somebody
101:39 - i knew somebody got fired years ago
101:42 - because he told a client
101:45 - what one of his other clients which is
101:46 - fidelity big mutual fund what they own
101:49 - or what they said in the meeting
101:50 - whatever
101:52 - um and so that that client
101:54 - might be grateful at first they heard
101:56 - that information but they don't trust
101:57 - you it's just it's not worth it it's not
101:59 - worth it yeah yeah yeah and
102:02 - sir richard branson and he's he's he's a
102:05 - he's amazing
102:06 - and i've listened to his all his audio
102:08 - books on audible
102:10 - um he just oozes positivity and he sets
102:12 - the corporate culture for the virgin
102:14 - companies
102:15 - which is why um if you fly virgin
102:17 - atlantic or virgin america
102:19 - all the uh the people that work on the
102:21 - airline the pilots et cetera the
102:23 - they're the attendants they're they're
102:24 - all really really positive and upbeat
102:27 - um you know unfortunately alaska
102:28 - airlines bought uh virgin america
102:30 - recently so maybe the culture will get
102:32 - you know diluted whatever
102:34 - but but i i mentioned sir richard
102:36 - branson because
102:38 - his parents if he ever backstabbed
102:40 - anybody when he was a kid they would
102:41 - make him stand up and look in the mirror
102:44 - and they would say look at yourself
102:46 - don't be that person
102:48 - don't be that person that backstabs
102:49 - others
102:51 - and little quick little side note off
102:52 - topic
102:54 - i have a guy i used to work for or work
102:56 - with i should say years ago
102:58 - he's so well spoken
103:00 - and i got and i met his parents at some
103:02 - events
103:03 - uh and and and i asked uh i asked his
103:06 - parents i said
103:07 - you know mike mike is so well spoken
103:09 - he's a gentleman he's confident
103:12 - how did he become that way
103:14 - and in you know how did you raise him
103:17 - and my kids were younger there so i was
103:18 - asking
103:19 - and they said well you know we one thing
103:21 - we did
103:23 - was we would make him stand up and read
103:26 - to us
103:27 - and
103:28 - when he was reading to us we we made
103:30 - sure he projected his voice
103:33 - and he was comfortable you know thinking
103:35 - on his feet and and standing and reading
103:38 - uh because we we got him to do it so we
103:41 - didn't just make him read in his room
103:42 - and my mom made me mom and dad during
103:44 - the summers when i was a kid they make
103:46 - me read for one hour every day every day
103:48 - in the summers which helped me out
103:50 - tremendously and i do with my kids now
103:52 - too except i add a sweetener i say
103:55 - if you read within the first hour of
103:57 - being awake
103:59 - you can read you got to do it for 45
104:01 - minutes
104:01 - or if it's later on the day it's like an
104:03 - hour
104:04 - so i incentivize them you know yeah
104:05 - readers are leaders yeah
104:09 - yeah and actually also this guy mike the
104:12 - way that he learned how to public speak
104:14 - was i've never tried this but
104:16 - they would make him put a pencil in his
104:18 - mouth
104:19 - and then speak
104:20 - and then that would try to speak clearly
104:22 - that way so yeah
104:26 - all right moving on
104:27 - next up
104:29 - number 27 how to tell if somebody is
104:32 - lying that's pinocchio there right
104:34 - um
104:36 - does that mean i'm a liar because i got
104:37 - a big nose no it's aerodynamic though it
104:40 - is like dude when i'm skiing because of
104:42 - this
104:42 - like like when i tuck like i go fast
104:45 - like try to beat me in a bike race you
104:47 - can't because this is the aerodynamic
104:48 - side of it but i'm not a liar i'm not
104:50 - pinocchio i just have a very very
104:52 - aerodynamic nose okay all right
104:55 - if i can't laugh myself who can i laugh
104:56 - at that reminds me of a sting song
104:58 - an english man in new york which i love
105:00 - off of sting's album the dream of the
105:02 - blue turtles and sting said
105:04 - it takes a man to suffer ignorance and
105:06 - smile be yourself no matter what they
105:08 - say
105:08 - i love it so how do you tell if
105:10 - somebody's lying and i covered this
105:11 - before i think so i'm going to go into
105:13 - this really really quickly so when i
105:14 - worked at a great big hedge fund
105:16 - um
105:18 - and uh
105:19 - it was called citadel
105:22 - uh and uh
105:24 - ken griffin nice guy um he's the the
105:27 - founder billionaire he actually just
105:29 - bought the biggest house or the most
105:31 - expensive house in american history
105:32 - uh and i remember whenever i meet with
105:34 - him i spent an hour and a half with him
105:36 - or an hour actually a half hour with him
105:37 - one day in his office
105:39 - and we talked about video games for for
105:40 - ages and i looked at his bookshelf
105:43 - and whenever i used to go into
105:44 - somebody's office that's really
105:45 - successful
105:47 - more successful than me which is all the
105:48 - time i would look at what books they
105:50 - have and i'd order them immediately
105:52 - and the book that that ken had actually
105:54 - ken griffin
105:56 - was a damadorian book on finance which i
105:58 - bought and i i have now
106:00 - but when i was at citadel upper
106:02 - management
106:03 - uh they sent um
106:06 - they sent 25-year fbi and cia veterans
106:09 - uh to train us on how to tell somebody's
106:10 - lying
106:12 - so now i know how to lie now i'm scared
106:14 - but this really helped us a lot because
106:16 - at that time it was like oh five i think
106:19 - there was a lot of there are a lot of
106:20 - scandals on wall street ceos were lying
106:23 - and there was a joke on wall street
106:24 - which is how do you know if a ceo is
106:26 - lying
106:28 - when they move their lips
106:30 - but but they trained us on how to tell
106:32 - somebody's lying and it helped me a lot
106:33 - actually then while i was investing and
106:35 - now today a lot
106:37 - i can tell usually
106:38 - so the four criteria is false
106:41 - and
106:42 - you one data point is mega trend you
106:44 - usually need two three or four of these
106:45 - to be correct or at least two of them
106:46 - right at least two
106:48 - uh and everybody's a little different so
106:49 - there are exceptions so number one if
106:52 - somebody breaks eye contact uh when
106:54 - they're talking about something
106:56 - that means they're they're probably
106:57 - lying
106:59 - however
107:00 - i break eye contact a lot like i look
107:01 - down a lot it's just i've always been
107:03 - like that i look down sometimes right um
107:06 - maybe i come across as not being
107:07 - confident i don't know just what i do
107:09 - um but if somebody breaks eye contact
107:12 - when answering a question
107:14 - then they might be lying
107:16 - yeah and sometimes when people blink a
107:18 - lot
107:19 - they might be lying and dude i see it on
107:21 - tv all the time i see people lying on tv
107:23 - all the time
107:25 - especially athletes when they're asked
107:27 - are they going to come back to the team
107:29 - next year and do they want to come back
107:31 - they break eye contact
107:34 - sometimes they they ramble
107:36 - um but you'll notice it you'll notice it
107:38 - and watch when somebody is being um
107:41 - being interviewed on television just
107:43 - watch how they answer questions
107:45 - you know if if they look away
107:47 - only the only time they look away a lot
107:49 - is when they're answering a question
107:50 - about something they're lying about that
107:51 - might be a lie all right so number one
107:53 - is they they break eye contact
107:56 - number two is if somebody rambles on and
107:59 - on and on and on and on and on and on
108:00 - and on kind of like i am right now
108:03 - to a simple yes or no question you know
108:04 - it's like a kid
108:06 - you ask a kid did you did you did you
108:08 - did you take the last cookie from the
108:10 - cookie jar
108:11 - no i didn't take a last quarter i mean i
108:13 - can't even reach it i mean look how tall
108:14 - it's it's high up there and then i don't
108:15 - know where the ladder is it's over there
108:17 - but you know what i mean with steps tool
108:18 - i can't find it's right there by the way
108:19 - but i yeah
108:23 - so there's that so we talked about um
108:25 - breaking eye contact we talked about
108:27 - rambling
108:28 - uh another one is if if somebody is
108:31 - shaking their foot and you can look down
108:33 - and see it sometimes when they're lying
108:35 - um and and sometimes because they've had
108:37 - too much caffeine which obviously means
108:39 - they get a hall pass
108:41 - but if somebody's shaking their foot a
108:43 - lot whatever when they're answering a
108:44 - question they could be lying and that's
108:46 - what a lie detector test does remember
108:48 - remember ben stiller and robert de niro
108:51 - and meet the parents right so that's
108:53 - anyway that's what they were testing
108:55 - he was cia i think in that movie
108:57 - yeah and there's there's one more oh
108:58 - yeah yeah touching your face touching
109:01 - your face yeah
109:02 - so uh if if if you touch your face a lot
109:05 - especially cover your mouth
109:07 - um and you usually don't do that but you
109:09 - do that when you're answering a question
109:10 - you might be lying so
109:12 - don't don't accept just one of those
109:13 - four criteria as being
109:16 - gospel that somebody's lying
109:18 - but multiple two or more of them could
109:20 - mean somebody is lying and speaking of
109:22 - touching your face and going off script
109:24 - again here
109:26 - of course given the health crisis we've
109:28 - all got these things um
109:30 - but what i do with my uh my kids and
109:32 - myself now is like and i went to my
109:35 - doctor years ago actually and i asked
109:37 - her i said why are you not sick all the
109:38 - time and she says because i wash my
109:40 - hands a lot and i never touch my face
109:42 - and so for me i've been biting my nails
109:45 - dude since i was born i i just i i do it
109:48 - it's it's terrible
109:50 - and my kids do it as well because monkey
109:52 - see monkey do you know whatever
109:54 - so what i did was i bought this stuff
109:55 - here it's called pro bell
109:57 - and um given the virus scare right now i
109:59 - put this on my nails
110:01 - and i put on my kid's nails as well
110:03 - and it tastes awful right it's not
110:05 - doesn't hurt yet but it just tastes
110:06 - awful but anyway
110:08 - a little off topic but interesting
110:10 - nonetheless
110:11 - so that's how you can tell if somebody
110:13 - is lying yeah
110:16 - all right next up is how to destroy your
110:17 - career in 30 seconds or less
110:22 - if you send an email or a text or or a
110:25 - snapchat and those are forever
110:27 - and you didn't think two or three times
110:29 - about it before clicking the send button
110:31 - you're done
110:32 - you're done just just be careful just be
110:34 - careful
110:35 - and
110:36 - i always know that emails are for life
110:39 - and everything i say on the phone is for
110:41 - life as well you know when i worked on
110:42 - wall street they used to say
110:44 - um just understand that
110:46 - all your calls could be recorded by the
110:49 - government the fbi whatever i was like
110:51 - that's fine i'm never going to do
110:53 - anything unethical anyway
110:55 - but that's
110:56 - you got to do that and sometimes they'll
110:57 - say
110:58 - this call is being recorded for for
111:00 - quality assurances or whatever or if you
111:02 - hear a beep in the background you're
111:04 - being recorded and they tell you to and
111:06 - it's totally bogus like when customer
111:08 - service calls you or you call them to
111:10 - get help and they're recording the call
111:12 - really like try it with them
111:14 - yeah can you help me oh by the way i'm
111:15 - recording this call
111:17 - what is that so a little off topic but
111:19 - just be really careful with electronic
111:22 - stuff email voicemail voice every it's
111:24 - all it's all recorded man you know the
111:27 - privacy died a decade or two ago you

115:05 - let's move on to section number six now
115:07 - so section number six is every battle is
115:10 - won before it's been fought it's a
115:12 - famous quote from sun tzu and the art of
115:14 - war
115:15 - and at the top there i wrote crucial
115:17 - battle preparation lessons and i've used
115:19 - that quote before from sun tzu so i'll
115:21 - go through this quickly
115:23 - all right so number one
115:25 - the first thing to talk about in section
115:27 - number six is
115:30 - over prepare for everything
115:33 - if you over prepare for something like
115:35 - really over prepare
115:36 - you actually will enjoy it
115:39 - when you're actually
115:40 - doing what you prepared for
115:42 - so like when you over prepare for a
115:45 - speech which i've i've done many many
115:47 - times before
115:48 - i get to the speech and i'm so ready
115:52 - i just kind of enjoy it man
115:54 - i can't explain it it's like
115:56 - this is out there but you remember when
115:57 - you were younger and you studied really
116:00 - hard for a math test like really really
116:02 - hard and your friends asked you for help
116:04 - and and you gave them help as well and
116:06 - you know when one teaches to learn
116:09 - but you you you studied a lot for it
116:12 - and then when you get into the exam
116:14 - it's so easy that you actually enjoy it
116:18 - you know you're you're comfortable
116:19 - you're confident you double check your
116:21 - work as always of course
116:23 - um but you enjoy it
116:25 - you know the exam is your friend
116:28 - you enjoy it because you over prepared
116:32 - and what i do also is when i give a
116:34 - speech quite often i bring two laptops
116:37 - and what i used to do is i would bring
116:39 - my laptop with powerpoint on whatever
116:40 - years ago and i would be i would bring
116:43 - uh those overhead slide things as well
116:45 - just in case just in case it broke down
116:48 - and when management at goldman sachs saw
116:50 - me do that like oh my gosh that's
116:51 - amazing i have confidence in this kit
116:54 - and when i give a speech at my brother's
116:55 - wedding back in 0-4 i did the same thing
116:57 - i had backups just in case just in case
117:01 - yeah
117:02 - so over prepare for for everything
117:04 - please and
117:05 - you know whenever when i used to
117:06 - interview other companies
117:08 - i prepare more than anybody like i
117:10 - recorded myself answering over 100
117:12 - questions i video recorded myself too
117:15 - did i sound too monotone did i sound too
117:17 - arrogant
117:18 - did i pause enough
117:20 - did i use frameworks to tie together my
117:23 - logic when i was lost in terms of moving
117:26 - on to the bottom line is
117:29 - and so if you over prepare for
117:30 - everything
117:32 - then
117:33 - you'll actually enjoy the event when it
117:35 - occurs
117:36 - because quite often life all comes down
117:38 - to a few short moments
117:40 - the crucial speech or a test or whatever
117:42 - it is
117:43 - so over prepare
117:45 - you know
117:46 - like i i i know that i work harder than
117:48 - anybody and i think it's because when i
117:50 - was younger they they thought i had a
117:52 - learning disability and they want to
117:54 - fail me in the sixth grade in the eighth
117:56 - grade and screw them whatever
117:58 - not my my not my parents my teachers
118:01 - uh and so i i kind of grew up insecure
118:05 - and i over prepared for everything and
118:07 - i'm so grateful to god that they kind of
118:10 - misdiagnosed me or whatever it was they
118:12 - tried to
118:13 - destroy my confidence
118:14 - i'm grateful to god it happened because
118:16 - i over prepare for everything now
118:17 - because of it
118:19 - and there's a great book by malcolm
118:20 - globwell called um
118:23 - david and goliath
118:25 - and it's about how people that have been
118:26 - told their whole lives that they're not
118:28 - good enough
118:29 - are the ones that ultimately
118:32 - do stuff that's important
118:35 - so if if people have told you your whole
118:37 - life or when you were younger and if
118:38 - your confidence is lower than it should
118:40 - be
118:42 - just
118:43 - be grateful that whatever happens within
118:46 - reason obviously
118:47 - whatever happened happened because your
118:49 - secret weapon is you're going to work
118:50 - your ass off work harder than anybody
118:53 - else
118:54 - and i've always worked harder than
118:55 - anybody and i keep pushing the goal post
118:57 - out and challenging myself and i think a
118:59 - lot of it stems to you know it's it's
119:02 - it's
119:03 - nurture and nature
119:05 - you know and you look at your kids why
119:06 - are they successful or not or whatever
119:08 - who cares
119:09 - i mean success should be what they think
119:11 - of themselves right you want to raise
119:12 - confidence kids but you you know
119:14 - somebody is
119:15 - reaches their full potential in life
119:17 - because of nurture or nature
119:19 - so for for me part of it is nature it's
119:21 - part of everybody but it's nurture
119:23 - always you know being told when i was
119:24 - younger you can't do it you can't do you
119:25 - can't do it or elon musk poor guy in
119:29 - south africa he got the crap kicked out
119:30 - of him a lot growing up
119:32 - or steven spielberg
119:33 - you know been you know being
119:36 - diagnosed with with um
119:38 - with with uh
119:40 - i think it was a dyslexia i can't
119:42 - remember yeah
119:44 - um and and he didn't get into usc film
119:46 - school he didn't get in which is the
119:48 - best film school so chip on his shoulder
119:50 - which is great just great i'm sure i'm
119:52 - sure there's more to it than that
119:54 - but but sometimes i feel like if i hire
119:55 - people from from harvard business school
119:57 - they're going to be entitled as hell
119:59 - and a lot of times like i'll i'll
120:01 - lecture
120:02 - at
120:03 - a lot of schools and there's one in
120:05 - particular in the bay area
120:07 - that i hate lecturing at now
120:09 - because
120:10 - there is insane entitlement and
120:13 - arrogance from a lot of the students
120:15 - i'm not going to name that school
120:18 - but my favorite school in the bay area
120:21 - is san francisco state i love those kids
120:23 - of death love no death i've hired them
120:25 - i'll continue to hire them they're the
120:26 - best
120:27 - a lot of them are wealthy but a lot are
120:28 - not and a lot are not entitled the worst
120:31 - thing possible is hiring somebody that's
120:33 - entitled
120:35 - you know it's like like they start and
120:37 - they're like i don't have to sweep the
120:38 - floor it's like oh here's a broom let me
120:39 - teach you
120:42 - over prepare for everything
120:45 - all right i love hiring people that are
120:46 - poor smart and hungry
120:48 - number 30 is the ohair test pass it and
120:50 - watch your career take off
120:53 - so the o'hare
120:54 - test is the chicago o'hare airport
120:57 - is a big airport that's one of the
120:58 - biggest ones
121:00 - and
121:01 - quite and i've spent a lot of time there
121:03 - like eight hours waiting in between
121:05 - flights and
121:06 - quite often with somebody else at work
121:08 - you know someone more senior than me
121:10 - whatever
121:11 - and
121:12 - did they enjoy my company and vice versa
121:14 - in that eight hour layover the o hair
121:16 - test it's important relationships are
121:18 - more important than product knowledge
121:19 - let me move
121:20 - on all right oh i got this one from my
121:23 - dad
121:24 - my dad said chichi
121:26 - never take a short that's my nickname
121:28 - growing up chichi
121:29 - never take a shortcut you've never taken
121:31 - before when you're in a hurry i
121:33 - completely believe that and you've all
121:34 - been through that too i know every
121:36 - single one of you have
121:37 - you're late for something you're driving
121:39 - whatever you're like oh i got to cut a
121:41 - corner you know i got let me take a
121:42 - shortcut i've never taken before and
121:44 - you're even later than if you've gone
121:46 - the regular routes
121:47 - there's no shortcuts in life so i think
121:50 - that's important to keep in mind
121:53 - all right so we are now done uh with
121:55 - section number six
121:57 - okay and so as always we're going to do
121:59 - next is we're going to do an exercise
122:02 - go to
122:03 - the cover page here if you want
122:05 - and click on number six or you can do it
122:08 - up here i always love to have multiple
122:09 - ways to access stuff
122:11 - and spend three minutes uh writing down
122:13 - notes here uh in in all the lessons
122:16 - uh for uh for section six
122:19 - on
122:20 - using the stuff you've learned this
122:22 - lesson to help to enhance your career
122:25 - so you got three minutes to do this go
122:29 - [Music]
123:07 - do
123:12 - [Music]
123:19 - do
123:21 - [Music]
123:46 - so
123:48 - [Music]
123:59 - [Music]
124:58 - [Music]
125:26 - moving on to section number seven you
125:28 - can hear me using my transition words
125:30 - here
125:31 - okay so uh
125:32 - goal setting okay follow these crucial
125:35 - steps and achieve your dreams and see if
125:38 - you guys can tell me what trophy that's
125:39 - from
125:41 - trying to be global here
125:43 - okay so the first lesson here that's
125:45 - number 32 is run to your fears
125:50 - whatever you're most scared of in life
125:52 - i want you to run to those fears
125:54 - because i promise you
125:56 - your competition is probably just as
125:58 - scared they just don't say it
126:01 - so whatever you're most fearful of in
126:03 - business or in life in general run
126:05 - towards it if you're scared of
126:06 - accounting
126:08 - condition yourself to enjoy it learn it
126:10 - better in your competition have fun with
126:12 - it too and always question why things
126:14 - are called what they're called like we
126:15 - talked before
126:17 - about understanding math like we we
126:19 - talked about the the banana i ain't
126:21 - falling for no banana the tailpipe we
126:23 - talked about the banana on the
126:24 - denominator
126:25 - we talked about the balance sheet it's
126:27 - got a balance so just understand stuff
126:30 - and condition yourself to understand
126:32 - stuff and enjoy stuff that you're
126:33 - fearful of
126:34 - meaning accounting or whatever it is if
126:36 - it scares you it scares your competition
126:38 - just as much i promise you
126:39 - so understand it and condition yourself
126:41 - to enjoy it maybe
126:43 - i don't know maybe like when you're
126:45 - learning accounting wherever it is get
126:46 - yourself a nice cup of coffee and listen
126:49 - nice classical music in the backgrounds
126:51 - um
126:52 - you know and if you're having uh
126:54 - problems doing that then remember when
126:56 - you're younger and you went to the
126:57 - library you remember the exact table you
126:59 - sat at
127:00 - deep in the stacks downstairs in that
127:02 - corner
127:04 - and you had your your music on and
127:06 - coffee go back there recreate that
127:08 - environment
127:10 - okay
127:11 - so run to your fears brenda your fears
127:13 - and i put a shark tank there on purpose
127:15 - uh and and if you're absolutely
127:16 - terrified of sharks
127:18 - why not try that and i found this
127:20 - picture here i actually got on adobe i i
127:22 - subscribe to a service where i get
127:24 - images
127:26 - so um there's actually it's actually a
127:27 - cage you can do with a bunch of others
127:29 - right so um
127:31 - a little bit scary for me but i want to
127:33 - get the point across and never have you
127:34 - forget it run to your fears if you're
127:36 - scared of public speaking
127:38 - put yourself out there man
127:40 - move to open spaces make yourself do it
127:44 - run to your fears conquer your fear
127:47 - because you'll never reach your full
127:48 - potential in life unless you conquer
127:49 - your fears
127:52 - all right next up is uh make a gap
127:55 - analysis and so
127:57 - i i love this analogy here
127:59 - um of of the mountain
128:02 - so if your goal
128:05 - is to accomplish something so big and
128:08 - we'll just say it's the top of the
128:09 - mountain
128:10 - then i want you to visualize success
128:13 - and just think about
128:15 - what do you need to do to fill that gap
128:16 - between where you are now and the top of
128:18 - the mountain okay so make a very basic
128:21 - gap analysis as part of your
128:22 - goal-setting strategy
128:25 - okay now lesson number 34 is
128:28 - yale university's fascinating goal
128:30 - setting study okay and some people say
128:32 - this is an urban legend or myth i don't
128:34 - care i want to talk about it anyway
128:37 - so in 1950
128:40 - yale university which is in the
128:41 - northeast of the united states yale
128:44 - university what they did in 1950 was
128:45 - they asked their their graduating class
128:48 - how many of you have written down your
128:50 - goals
128:51 - and three percent said
128:53 - i have written down my goals
128:55 - then 20 years later they went back to
128:58 - the same graduating class in 1970
129:02 - and they calculated the net worth
129:04 - of everybody that graduated 1950 20
129:06 - years later
129:08 - and the net worth of the three percent
129:09 - that had written down their goals
129:11 - was greater than the other 97 combined
129:15 - it's pretty amazing pretty amazing so
129:18 - don't forget to write down your goals
129:19 - and i used to carry my goals everywhere
129:21 - with me they're now on my my iphone in
129:23 - my calendar they repeat daily but what i
129:25 - used to do was i would print out i would
129:26 - buy those remember those those business
129:28 - cards you can make yourself you put in
129:30 - your printer and you pop them out and
129:32 - they look awful whatever
129:33 - i would get those
129:35 - and then i would use powerpoint i
129:36 - remember and just kind of write down
129:38 - type my goals on the back in front of 10
129:41 - cards and carry them around with me
129:42 - everywhere and when i was down and out
129:44 - i'd read through them
129:45 - and i'm humbled to say i've accomplished
129:47 - pretty much every goal
129:48 - um one of the exceptions is uh
129:52 - not getting a black belt in karate but
129:54 - i'm a mean yellow belt yeah
129:59 - all right uh next up is number 35 should
130:02 - you get a graduate degree so you go to
130:04 - university
130:06 - um i i would say that if you network a
130:09 - lot
130:10 - and you still can't get
130:12 - that career change
130:14 - like if you set up literally a hundred
130:16 - networking meetings
130:17 - i found this
130:18 - that's i don't know that's siri talking
130:20 - again sorry put her aside it's a daily
130:22 - event
130:24 - right
130:25 - so
130:27 - uh if you set up a hundred networking
130:29 - meetings and you still can't change
130:30 - careers
130:31 - then consider getting your graduate
130:33 - degree
130:34 - that's what i would say that's what i
130:36 - would say yeah uh and you might say
130:38 - chris 100 is a little extreme
130:40 - well dude getting a graduate degree at
130:43 - university it can cost a hundred grand
130:45 - including lost wages etc
130:48 - 100 grand
130:49 - so that means that a thousand or 100
130:51 - meetings
130:53 - that's like a thousand dollars each
130:54 - meeting i'm saving you
130:56 - so again do a hundred meetings i know it
130:59 - sounds like a lot and when i say 100 it
131:01 - probably means you'll do 30. and you'll
131:02 - still get what you want because you did
131:03 - 30.
131:04 - like james cameron said set your goals
131:06 - so high that if you fail you still fail
131:08 - above everyone else's expectations
131:11 - it's kind of like we did cryptocurrency
131:13 - stuff i didn't really expect you guys to
131:14 - do all 49 steps
131:16 - but if you do a lot of them that's
131:18 - that's better than just one or two or
131:20 - not right
131:21 - okay and what you can also do is if you
131:23 - try your best to network to make that
131:24 - career change and you can't
131:27 - then um
131:28 - go to linkedin and find people that have
131:30 - done it and look at their blueprints do
131:32 - they have graduate degrees what have
131:33 - they done to get there
131:34 - but i guarantee you i almost guarantee
131:36 - you if you network like crazy you can
131:38 - you get pretty much where you want in
131:39 - life
131:40 - obviously there's exceptions if you want
131:41 - to be a doctor
131:43 - you know
131:44 - you have to go to medical school
131:45 - although i'm on the board of a charity
131:47 - i'm really proud of called doctors
131:49 - without diplomas yeah
131:52 - that's not true yeah
131:55 - okay number number 36 i love this one
131:57 - push the goal post out
132:00 - um
132:01 - once you achieve your goals
132:03 - what you got to do is you got to you
132:05 - gotta you gotta push the goal post out
132:07 - you you gotta set new goals always
132:09 - because sometimes when you achieve your
132:11 - goals
132:12 - you get a little bit depressed
132:13 - i know it's weird like at first you're
132:15 - like hey i did it you're like
132:17 - dude now what
132:19 - got to keep pushing the goal post out
132:22 - keep challenging yourself
132:24 - uh and if you get a chance i want you to
132:26 - please go and do a search on matthew
132:28 - mcconaughey's best oscar speech from
132:31 - things 2014 or maybe a little bit before
132:33 - that i don't remember
132:34 - but he talks about
132:36 - competing with himself
132:38 - and challenging himself and it was
132:39 - amazing oscar speech i love it to death
132:42 - because he was so real
132:44 - he didn't give a damn what people
132:45 - thought about him he was talking to his
132:47 - dad up in heaven
132:49 - and he was saying
132:51 - dad i love you
132:53 - i know you're up there
132:54 - in your underpants probably
132:56 - with lemon pie
132:59 - with a can of miller light and you're
133:01 - dancing
133:02 - he didn't care then he talked about
133:05 - challenging himself so watch that that
133:06 - speech if you get a chance it's pretty
133:08 - powerful
133:09 - that's right from his heart
133:10 - you know and as maya angelou said
133:14 - people might not remember what you said
133:16 - but they'll never forget the way you
133:17 - made them feel i really believe that and
133:20 - when i get my explain you how to give a
133:22 - great speech
133:23 - um which you have to learn thoroughly um
133:26 - if you're gonna write a business plan
133:27 - because when you write a business plan
133:29 - and you present it to potential
133:31 - investors
133:32 - you got to inspire them as well
133:34 - and i'm going to teach you you know how
133:36 - to give a presentation
133:37 - um like uh like matthew mcconaughey did
133:40 - and i think he got the award for dallas
133:42 - buyer's club or some movie back then yet
133:45 - all right so we are now done with

141:23 - nothing
141:24 - so happy
141:26 - they were so happy
141:28 - it's kind of like when um i remember
141:30 - matthew my youngest kid
141:34 - we used to go to the park on sundays
141:37 - and
141:39 - there was always a large group
141:42 - of
141:43 - people from
141:44 - immigrants
141:46 - and they would sit on they had nothing
141:49 - like we had a nice blanket to sit on
141:51 - they had cardboard boxes and they would
141:53 - barbecue
141:55 - and there was tons of them
141:57 - together in a family
141:59 - you know a bond of love
142:01 - and my son matthew he was like four of
142:03 - them he said daddy why
142:06 - why do they always seem so much happier
142:08 - than everybody else
142:10 - they got nothing to lose you know you
142:12 - want to buy experiences not things
142:15 - and then you go to an expensive
142:16 - restaurant look around dude when you go
142:18 - to expensive restaurant look around
142:20 - you see all these arrogant people
142:22 - whatever and i like going at good
142:24 - restaurants whatever but they're not as
142:26 - happy as when you go to a park
142:29 - you know it's sometimes i feel like like
142:31 - david geffen
142:33 - he's a billionaire and
142:35 - no high school degree started in the
142:36 - mail room and he uh
142:38 - he started guffing records he signed

142:44 - um and then he's one third of dreamworks
142:46 - as well along with katzenbergen and
142:48 - spielberg but but david geffen said
142:52 - for those of you that think that money
142:54 - can buy you happiness you don't have
142:55 - money
142:57 - it's it does not buy happiness at all i
142:59 - promise you and and i remember uh when i
143:02 - worked at goldman
143:04 - every christmas you get you got a bonus
143:07 - everyone was so damn depressed every
143:08 - christmas
143:09 - because the cancer of wall street

143:14 - compare yourselves to those that have
143:16 - more you know when you look into the
143:19 - bowl of your neighbor
143:21 - you shouldn't look to see if you have
143:23 - more
143:24 - you you should look to see if if he or
143:26 - she has enough or at least as much as
143:28 - you do
143:29 - yeah
143:30 - so money no matter what you think
143:33 - does not buy happiness of course we need
143:35 - to make a certain amount to live
143:37 - but
143:40 - don't make money your god

146:09 - i like every mother does i used to
146:11 - experiment with different things putting
146:13 - in his different box
146:15 - most of the time the other vegetables
146:18 - they will return from the school
146:19 - untouched
146:20 - but whenever i am giving okra it is
146:22 - finished
146:24 - i asked him why you like okra the most
146:26 - he said mama
146:28 - my teacher has told the child who eats
146:31 - okra becomes best in his mathematics
146:36 - my son is progressing day by day
146:39 - his dreams are getting fulfilled
146:43 - and his happiness is more than what i
146:46 - ever want for him
146:48 - when he will look at the tiffin box
146:50 - first he will think from where has it
146:52 - come but once he tastes the food he will
146:55 - know it is made by his mummy
146:59 - and i am sure he will start searching
147:01 - for me in his apartment
147:05 - i miss him so much because when he left
147:08 - home he was hardly 17 years old
147:14 - and from that day

147:22 - i miss myself

147:44 - there i was
147:46 - walking to her door
147:47 - smelling her cooking

147:52 - sometimes even when you know what's
147:53 - going to happen
147:55 - you cannot even imagine how it's going
147:56 - to be
147:59 - i got the opportunity to see my mother
148:01 - in a way had never seen her before

148:13 - her a hug
148:15 - [Music]

149:37 - to get something later that will make
149:38 - you happier thing-wise
149:41 - but
149:42 - happiness is just
149:44 - appreciating what you have
149:47 - that's what it is
149:49 - and i believe that if you're happy and
149:50 - if this works
149:52 - this will work much much better
149:54 - you'll come full circle
149:59 - okay next up is all your wealth can't
150:02 - buy you health it's so true
150:05 - um and
150:07 - that that's a quote i think from i think
150:09 - i got it from bob dylan yeah all your
150:10 - wealth can't buy your health
150:12 - uh and there's a great book by the the
150:14 - dalai lama that i mentioned before
150:17 - i read it on my honeymoon and when i was
150:19 - in indonesia which is a great setting
150:22 - and
150:23 - read his book if you haven't yet but but
150:24 - he says basically that
150:28 - the problem with western society is we
150:30 - sacrifice
150:32 - our health our entire lives in order to
150:34 - make money
150:37 - then at the end of our lives we
150:38 - sacrifice all of our money to maintain
150:41 - our health
150:43 - and then we look back
150:45 - and we realize
150:47 - we never really lived to begin with
150:51 - so treasure every single day
150:54 - every day
150:56 - smell the roses along the way i used to
150:58 - tell myself years ago when i was in my
151:00 - 20s i was like i don't get married have
151:02 - kids until i make my fortune in my
151:04 - empire dude
151:06 - what's the point
151:09 - start a family now enjoy life today
151:13 - don't live for tomorrow
151:15 - live for today
151:20 - number 42 is when to change careers
151:24 - and
151:25 - i hate to end this on a down note but i
151:28 - have to in order to make a big impact
151:31 - like i mentioned before if you get out
151:33 - of bed in the morning
151:34 - and you're not happy
151:36 - and you feel some sort of depression
151:39 - related to your job
151:43 - channel that frustration and that
151:45 - unhappiness
151:48 - network like crazy
151:50 - channel that frustration
151:52 - and find something you love doing
151:54 - you know don't only focus on money i get
151:56 - it we have to pay bills i get it but
151:58 - enough's enough dude
152:00 - like at some point you got to realize
152:01 - that
152:02 - what am i here for
152:07 - why don't i laugh as much as i used to
152:09 - when i was younger
152:11 - why am i working in a big company i'm
152:13 - not being myself
152:15 - when i was younger i used to laugh so
152:16 - hard until i fell down with my buddies
152:18 - and it hurt in a good way
152:22 - why am i not laughing anymore
152:24 - why am i not being myself
152:27 - why do i get up every day and go to a
152:29 - job i can't stand working for people i
152:31 - don't respect
152:33 - and i don't respect myself as much
152:35 - anymore because i'm not being myself
152:37 - either i'm being political at work i'm
152:39 - not being me
152:42 - i just want to be me
152:45 - so if you're depressed
152:47 - and if you don't see work
152:50 - as something you enjoy
152:52 - don't do it
152:53 - you know don't try to live somebody
152:55 - else's life or or or be a prisoner in
152:58 - someone else's mind and do stuff to make
153:01 - them happy
153:03 - like if people in your life want you to
153:05 - be a lawyer or doctor whatever it is
153:08 - and you're not passionate about wanting
153:10 - to be a lawyer meaning you don't want to
153:11 - be a liar
153:14 - and you're not passionate about
153:16 - being a doctor because you want to be
153:17 - around blood and stuff if that's not
153:21 - i mean it's great to help people
153:23 - and i respect you know all doctors
153:26 - and um
153:27 - civil rights lawyers only
153:30 - but
153:31 - you got to do it what drives you makes
153:33 - you happy because i really do believe
153:35 - that if you
153:36 - if you do something you love doing in
153:38 - life you find the why of your life
153:44 - then you'll
153:45 - not only be good at it
153:47 - but the money will come accidentally
153:49 - you won't
153:50 - i mean i i go to a basketball game or a
153:52 - football game or whatever
153:54 - and all these dudes on the field
153:56 - they don't get up in the morning and say
153:58 - oh god i gotta go play a game today
154:01 - that's not work man that's awesome
154:03 - same thing with rock and roll star
154:05 - you know they don't get up in the
154:06 - morning oh god i gotta play another gig
154:08 - today
154:11 - it's a beautiful thing to be an artist
154:12 - because you get to express yourself
154:15 - which is why also like i think of what i
154:17 - do and what we all do as as being art
154:21 - you know the the palette for us is a
154:23 - powerpoint document or an excel
154:26 - spreadsheet that we can we can jazz up
154:28 - with cool buttons and colors and fun
154:31 - stuff
154:32 - it's artistic and it's fun for me and
154:35 - for you as well
154:37 - but
154:39 - you got to do something you love doing
154:40 - in life
154:41 - and you got to take risks as well and
154:43 - start your own companies on the side
154:46 - and in semesters three and four we'll
154:47 - you'll you'll write a kick-ass business
154:49 - plan and i'll help you
154:50 - kind of define what
154:52 - it might look like in the future for you
154:54 - but
154:55 - the worst thing can happen to you is
154:57 - you're
154:58 - you wake up one day and you're way older
155:00 - than you are now
155:02 - and
155:04 - you're working for this jerk
155:06 - that pays you
155:07 - this much money
155:09 - to make their dreams become a reality
155:12 - you got to take chance to take risks
155:14 - if you're not happy doing what you're
155:15 - doing either
155:17 - change your line of work by networking a
155:18 - lot or do a ton of side hustles on the

165:10 - let's just say that
165:11 - one of the uh the things you wrote down
165:14 - was i don't know

168:10 - chris what is going on why do you have
168:13 - this thing up here
168:14 - uh well i want to do something a little
168:16 - bit different today before we we jumped
168:18 - right in on it um
168:21 - when i was a kid
168:23 - i remember laughing so hard until it
168:26 - hurt
168:28 - and
168:29 - with my friends you know what i'm
168:30 - talking about like yeah sometimes you're
168:32 - rolling on the ground laughing so hard
168:33 - and then what happens is you
168:35 - i don't know you kind of grow up and you
168:38 - you stop laughing as much and you start
168:40 - working for other people
168:42 - and you're just not yourself anymore
168:45 - and and
168:46 - this really hit home for me because this
168:48 - here is um
168:50 - this is a a chair
168:52 - from uh exhibition stadium uh which is a
168:55 - a great stadium that no longer exists in
168:58 - toronto
168:59 - and it was for the the blue jays
169:01 - actually the toronto blue jays my
169:02 - baseball team i'm so passionate about
169:04 - sports
169:05 - and you can see i've got a big ticket up
169:06 - there as well for the first game in
169:08 - 1977. tickets were really really big
169:11 - back then but now people are
169:12 - environmentally environmentally friendly
169:15 - dad here we know i promise
169:17 - but the one thing that my dad my brother
169:19 - my family and i my sisters my mom and we
169:21 - all have in common is a love of baseball
169:23 - and love of sports uh love of the
169:25 - toronto blue jays uh i'm feeling
169:27 - homesick just thinking about it uh and
169:29 - so i bought this uh it wasn't that
169:31 - expensive it's it's it's old it's rusty
169:33 - as you can tell i bought this on on ebay
169:35 - and get anything on ebay
169:36 - and it reminds me of the great times i
169:38 - had with my dad my my my family going to
169:41 - to games growing up and you know when i
169:44 - was a kid i didn't i didn't realize that
169:47 - baseball was a business or sports was a
169:49 - business and that's why it meant like i
169:51 - still love sports i still love baseball
169:53 - and the blue jays especially
169:55 - but um
169:57 - it meant a lot more to me when i was
169:58 - younger yeah and i just want to cherish
170:00 - these memories and you know sometimes
170:03 - when i um
170:04 - when i'm not in the best of moods or i'm
170:06 - kind of upset or depressed a bit which
170:09 - happens
170:10 - um i i think about when i was younger
170:11 - and when i laughed really hard until it
170:13 - hurt give me one second i want to get
170:15 - something here i got a
170:17 - got a couple these props here um
170:21 - this is a canadian money this is real
170:23 - canadian money what we use there that's
170:24 - i don't know why i picked that up sorry
170:26 - i got a couple baseball cards um and
170:29 - these meant the world to me when i was a
170:30 - kid these are rookie cards for a couple
170:32 - of great troll blue jays players
170:33 - whatever
170:34 - but this here
170:36 - this here means a lot to me and
170:39 - what happened and my kids like they have
170:41 - a love of baseball as well um
170:44 - and
170:46 - i want you all to think about one point
170:48 - in your life when you were so euphoric
170:52 - so happy and i want you to meditate
170:54 - about that really think about it
170:56 - and i want that to be your trigger
170:58 - for if you ever aren't in the best moods
171:01 - you're not if you're not in the peak
171:02 - peak mental state if you're not yourself
171:04 - if you're not happy
171:05 - i want you to remember when you were
171:06 - younger maybe you were family at a game
171:09 - or something bonding with your dad your
171:11 - mom your brother sister whatever
171:13 - your your spouse uh and that should
171:16 - put you back in that peak mental state
171:18 - we all have one or two incidents in our
171:19 - life that we all remember that put us in
171:21 - that peak mental state um and i wasn't
171:23 - even planning on talking about this but
171:24 - i'm gonna wing it this is um
171:26 - well okay so
171:28 - this here
171:29 - um and if you can't see it properly um
171:32 - then matt what i want you to do is match
171:34 - my editor he's awesome get the 2016 tops
171:37 - jose batista card uh number eight and
171:40 - and this here was um
171:42 - a game number of years ago uh and my
171:45 - three boys and i'll show you what my
171:46 - kids look like actually
171:48 - um so these are my my three boys this is
171:51 - um andrew um dylan a little munchkin uh
171:56 - and he's usually not that quiet
171:58 - and matthew and they're so different
172:00 - they're like sons to me i love them to
172:01 - death
172:02 - but
172:04 - i i bring this up because
172:06 - what happened was we were watching a
172:08 - baseball game it was 2015.
172:11 - it was one of the happiest moments of my
172:12 - life
172:13 - after i got married and all that good
172:14 - stuff in case christine's watching yeah
172:16 - but we were watching the game here it
172:18 - was in this house and we're upstairs and
172:21 - we were losing the game to the texas
172:23 - rangers another baseball team
172:24 - and this guy named jose batista and this
172:27 - is a a picture of of what happened
172:30 - he hit the most
172:32 - epic home run
172:33 - and it was a come from behind victory
172:35 - and then he flipped his bat
172:37 - and we all like my three boys and me
172:40 - they have a little brother me we all
172:42 - jumped up and down up and down up and
172:44 - down and we're yelling top of our lungs
172:46 - we were so happy and they were jumping
172:47 - into my arms and all that stuff and
172:49 - i was
172:50 - i was euphoric i was happy
172:53 - and
172:54 - whenever i'm not in the best moods i i
172:56 - think of this situation here and by the
172:58 - way this this baseball that he hits to
173:00 - win that game uh i bid on it in an
173:03 - auction i gotta open it right at the end
173:04 - killed me but whatever it is what is um
173:07 - but this is what i think of
173:09 - this moment right here
173:12 - and so um
173:14 - and maybe this camera has got a better
173:15 - angle i'm not sure with the lighting and
173:16 - stuff uh but
173:18 - but that's yeah this is uh
173:20 - this means the world to me you know my
173:22 - boys obviously my family and christine
173:24 - like my parents everybody
173:26 - and when i'm not in the best of moods uh
173:27 - what i do
173:28 - is um and give me one second put this
173:31 - back here
173:32 - make sure there's no
173:34 - glare i don't think there is whoop okay
173:36 - good glare scott nice when i'm running
173:38 - out of the best of moods i i think of
173:40 - this this event
173:42 - and it gets me back into peak mental
173:44 - state
173:45 - you know um
173:47 - you can snap out of a crappy mood
173:50 - by
173:50 - thinking of a trigger point in your life
173:53 - at one point in your life when you were
173:54 - you were so euphoric so happy
173:57 - um and you know just because you're
173:59 - older now doesn't mean you can't
174:01 - love the same things that you loved when
174:03 - you were a lot younger like you like
174:05 - video games f it play video games
174:08 - you know you love sports just don't
174:09 - think of it like it's a business just
174:11 - remember the times you bonded with
174:13 - family and friends
174:14 - over great sporting events and if you
174:16 - can if you get a chance
174:18 - you know if they tear down your stadium
174:20 - that you used to go to whether it's a i
174:22 - don't know cricket stadium rugby
174:24 - baseball australian rules football or
174:26 - whatever it is
174:27 - see if you can buy that that seat yeah
174:29 - so anyway um
174:32 - think about a trigger point if you can't
174:34 - in your life to get you in that peak
174:36 - mental state if you ever need uh a
174:37 - pick-me-up
174:39 - okay
174:40 - what i'll do now is i'll go into
174:41 - high-speed and and i'll get this old
174:43 - rustic uh piece of not junk out of the
174:46 - way
174:51 - all right
174:52 - let's do this let's do this this will be
174:54 - a fun class
174:55 - so again this is uh
174:58 - e1-3
175:01 - unjustified criticism
175:03 - is nothing more than a disguised
175:04 - compliment so bring it on doubters and
175:07 - i'm gonna have a bunch of brand new
175:08 - quotes that you're gonna enjoy i hope
175:10 - you enjoy them uh and so if if somebody
175:12 - says something that that
175:14 - dislodges you or gets you out of your
175:16 - peak mental state
175:18 - um
175:19 - and it's so unjustified i want you do
175:21 - one of two things
175:22 - the first thing i want you to do is i
175:25 - want you to tell yourself
175:27 - they're probably very envious
175:29 - for whatever reason
175:30 - you know and that criticism i don't
175:33 - choose to accept it
175:34 - because it's unjustified but you know
175:36 - what and this is me talking to the jerk
175:39 - that criticized me or whoever it might
175:40 - be in the future and you know who i'm
175:41 - talking about this has all happened to
175:43 - all of us you know what
175:45 - i want to thank that jerk
175:47 - because
175:48 - he is so insecure
175:50 - that he gave me a great compliment thank
175:53 - you bring it on bring it on
175:55 - and if you're not getting criticized
175:57 - you're not successful enough it's gonna
175:59 - happen and i want you to embrace it
176:01 - because unjustified criticism is nothing
176:04 - more than a disguised compliment think
176:05 - about that
176:06 - also think about um
176:08 - that trigger point you have in your life
176:10 - for me it's that jose batista

178:15 - uh and in the last workbook uh we did uh
178:18 - 1 through 42. so if you haven't watched
178:19 - the previous lecture please go back and
178:21 - watch it first okay thank you
178:23 - all right
178:24 - let's talk about section number nine
178:27 - which is called legal stuff is important
178:31 - and so
178:32 - lesson number 43 is how to protect your
178:35 - family
178:37 - it's really really important
178:39 - if you ever start a company
178:41 - or if
178:43 - you're part of a partnership and you
178:45 - have equity in a company
178:46 - that if somebody gives you an employment
178:48 - contract that you hire a lawyer to get
178:50 - them to review it
178:52 - the problem with lawyers is it doesn't
178:54 - matter
178:55 - if you really trust the person you're
178:56 - working for
178:58 - if they give you a contract to sign
179:01 - they probably haven't read it their
179:02 - lawyer made it and their lawyer is
179:05 - obviously biased
179:07 - uh and so i really want you to hire a
179:09 - lawyer on the side to review the legal
179:12 - document please do that please please
179:14 - please
179:15 - um and i've done that before when i've
179:17 - been part of partnerships and it saved
179:19 - my ass it really really did
179:22 - what happened was there was a
179:23 - stipulation
179:24 - in the contract that if one of our
179:25 - companies we invested in venture capital
179:27 - companies got acquired
179:30 - or had an exit
179:31 - or there was a harvesting event meaning
179:33 - it went public or whatever
179:35 - that
179:36 - there was no timeline when i would get
179:38 - paid but i would get paid one day which
179:41 - could have meant 50 million years from
179:42 - now whatever so that that really saved
179:44 - my backside uh and i actually ended up
179:46 - selling all my positions whatever
179:48 - um and
179:50 - also when when when i've had other like
179:53 - i in my hedge fund i had 25 of my hedge
179:55 - fund um i actually had a i sold it to a
179:58 - high net worth investor that was one of
180:00 - my my big backers
180:02 - uh and and i hired a lawyer as well and
180:05 - the lawyer put in some language to just
180:07 - to save my backside like all the people
180:09 - in business i've dealt with they've been
180:10 - ethical i trust them
180:12 - but you gotta you gotta watch out uh and
180:14 - the same thing when it comes to
180:16 - if you start your own company
180:18 - once you start generating some revenue
180:20 - please make sure
180:21 - that you talk to a lawyer i'm going to
180:23 - get down my knees now because i want you
180:24 - i want you to remember this forever can
180:26 - i make a fool of myself laugh at me ouch
180:28 - not with me hurts my knees now when i
180:29 - kneel i'm getting older

180:35 - three cameras actually please you you
180:37 - and you
180:38 - i want you all
180:40 - to get a lawyer
180:42 - to create
180:43 - documents to register your company when

180:47 - you start figuring out that this is
180:49 - something you want to do for us your
180:50 - life or you're generating revenue that
180:52 - sort of thing
180:53 - it's really important because when you
180:55 - start getting some success people will
180:57 - come after you they'll sue you it's
180:58 - happened to me having me recently
181:00 - actually uh and and somebody went after

181:53 - brain will understand and sympathize
181:55 - with you as well okay
181:58 - all right uh next up is um always
182:03 - always always
182:05 - ask
182:06 - a lawyer for help
182:08 - if
182:09 - you're not sure
182:11 - if an investment opportunity is
182:14 - legitimate
182:15 - okay so
182:17 - if you don't get an investor uh offering
182:19 - memorandum or an s1 document or whatever
182:22 - it might be if you can't get access to
182:24 - that
182:24 - or if it looks like it's half-assed
182:27 - and
182:28 - i want you to get your lawyer to look at
182:30 - that first okay or at least seek their
182:32 - counsel and never invest in anything
182:33 - without legal documents anyway like an
182:35 - offering memorandum and we've talked a
182:37 - lot about how to read them how to read
182:38 - the s ones for example
182:40 - so make sure you have access that and
182:42 - don't ever do a big investment yourself
182:45 - without getting your lawyer to review
182:46 - the documents anyway just in case
182:49 - just in case okay so just
182:51 - always be careful and that's one of the
182:53 - very few lawyers i love which is um
182:55 - gandhi i think he's a lawyer right i
182:57 - think so yeah okay
182:59 - all right next up staying out of trouble
183:02 - uh in this digital reality we all know
183:04 - this that everything is recorded
183:06 - everything every email is recorded
183:09 - every snapchat that's right be careful
183:11 - that every snapchat every tick tock or
183:14 - whatever video
183:15 - the video does your platform is
183:17 - every single one is recorded
183:19 - every phone call is well
183:21 - everything
183:23 - so
183:24 - obviously not anything unethical but
183:25 - just be careful just be careful things
183:27 - can be taken out of context always
183:30 - always always
183:31 - in every message that i write
183:34 - in everything i say on every phone call
183:36 - i've always been
183:38 - very careful in case somebody takes it
183:40 - out of context
183:42 - always be careful
183:44 - if you feel like you're being trapped
183:45 - with an email
183:47 - don't respond
183:49 - don't respond
183:51 - be careful
183:52 - everything is recorded and when i worked
183:55 - on wall street
183:56 - every now and then i'd hear a beep in
183:58 - the background and that meant that the
184:00 - call is being recorded by law they had
184:01 - to do that
184:02 - and i know for a fact actually i think i
184:04 - know
184:05 - that a lot of my calls were recorded by
184:08 - the fbi
184:10 - and the sec
184:12 - i never got caught for anything i never
184:13 - did anything wrong
184:15 - but just in case be careful
184:17 - and i was told actually at a couple
184:19 - hedge funds i worked at that just
184:21 - pretend every call is recorded just be
184:23 - careful
184:24 - just be careful it's never worth it
184:26 - cutting corners anyway
184:28 - it's never worth it never worth it
184:29 - there's so many celebrities that have
184:31 - gone to jail
184:32 - for years
184:34 - for something as stupid as a buddy
184:36 - calling said hey i got a stock pick for
184:37 - you okay thanks okay i'll buy it
184:39 - whatever
184:40 - they heard something like martha stewart
184:42 - etc just be careful okay
184:44 - assume everything is documented
184:48 - every every single phone call email etc
184:51 - i know it sounds a little silly for me
184:52 - to go on and on and on about this but i
184:54 - care i care yeah
184:56 - and if a lawsuit ever does occur
184:59 - what's going to happen is lawyers will
185:01 - go through email servers um texts
185:04 - whatever and they'll find they can find
185:06 - something like i believe warren buffett
185:09 - said this if you ever investigate
185:10 - somebody enough you'll find something
185:12 - you'll find something
185:14 - so just be careful yeah
185:17 - all right next up is i want you to

185:48 - your career you have three minutes go
185:52 - [Music]
186:26 - [Music]
186:47 - so
186:49 - [Music]
187:05 - [Music]
187:23 - [Music]

187:43 - [Music]
188:22 - [Music]
188:48 - welcome back
188:50 - section number 10
188:52 - management best practices
188:55 - the most crucial business revelation is
188:58 - that ideas are commodities execution is
189:01 - not it's all about the management team
189:03 - most people don't realize that most
189:05 - people think if i have a solid business
189:07 - model
189:08 - then everybody will invest and things
189:10 - will work out that's not the way the
189:11 - world works
189:13 - so let's go through these
189:15 - so lesson number 46 is you want to
189:17 - praise in public and criticize in
189:20 - private and this is a great way to
189:22 - manage people
189:23 - and i actually got this this idea here
189:25 - from the former ceo
189:27 - of a great software company called
189:29 - splunk splk is the ticker
189:32 - and godfrey sullivan was the former ceo
189:35 - of the company and i also invested in
189:37 - him
189:38 - when he was the ceo of a great software
189:41 - company called hyperion that oracle
189:42 - bought and before that godfrey worked at
189:45 - apple he has a lot of great experience
189:46 - and so i'm trying to impress upon the
189:48 - importance of looking at a great
189:49 - management team first before investing
189:51 - now godfrey said one day to me um you
189:54 - know i asked why are you so successful
189:55 - and people will do that man it's great
189:57 - and that's the crux of my whole book
189:59 - people will do that if you see somebody
190:00 - successful
190:02 - um get more successful than you are
190:04 - right now right now
190:06 - then i want you to approach them and ask
190:08 - them for you know just advice ask them
190:10 - what give me one reason why you're
190:11 - successful and people love talking about
190:13 - themselves look at me i i i won't stop
190:15 - talking i keep talking about myself it's
190:17 - annoying really
190:18 - uh but i'm not successful
190:20 - uh but
190:21 - so yeah i've met with a ton of people
190:23 - that are way more successful ever be and
190:25 - i always ask them for one piece of
190:26 - advice that's not taught in schools
190:28 - and that's why i do what i do right now
190:30 - i'm trying to teach you real practical
190:31 - based stuff
190:33 - uh and not theoretical crap
190:36 - and so godfrey said he likes to praise
190:38 - in public and only criticize in private
190:42 - you know there's nothing worse than
190:44 - being criticized by your boss in front
190:46 - of many of your i don't know fellow
190:48 - workmates
190:50 - um it destroys morale and it makes you
190:53 - makes you hate your job
190:55 - so nobody wins
190:56 - if you're going to critic criticize
190:58 - somebody uh try to do it in private
191:01 - always always always and there's right
191:02 - ways to criticize tim
191:04 - you know um and there's
191:06 - i hate to do this uh but i think i'll
191:08 - talk about it right now um
191:11 - and i'm gonna tell you about how to
191:13 - hire and fire people later but
191:16 - today but when you let somebody go
191:19 - that what you're supposed to do is this
191:21 - and they usually know it's coming
191:23 - you sit down with them and you start off
191:26 - by and usually do it on a monday if you
191:28 - want to ruin their weekend
191:30 - you you start off by saying something
191:32 - very complimentary
191:33 - but sincere and real
191:35 - like everybody on the team
191:37 - really enjoys your company and you did a
191:39 - great job on the project x or whatever
191:41 - it is
191:43 - however
191:44 - due to this this and this i'm so sorry
191:47 - we have to let you go
191:48 - so you always start with with something
191:50 - positive and that's extreme because i'm
191:52 - talking about letting somebody go and
191:54 - i'll give you more information on how to
191:55 - do that very very soon
191:58 - but when you're criticizing somebody uh
192:00 - that you want to keep
192:01 - um you want to start off and be
192:03 - complimentary at first yeah yeah it's
192:06 - more subtle that way and it'll take it
192:07 - better as well yeah
192:10 - all right um next up is be unemotional
192:14 - in business that's that's the incredible
192:15 - hulk there
192:16 - um
192:18 - so
192:20 - and i've mentioned this before
192:22 - that a lot of the best investors i've
192:24 - worked for a lot of billionaires and i
192:26 - won't say which ones ever
192:28 - but some of them it feels like they were
192:29 - borderline aspergers um
192:32 - and they were unemotional
192:34 - and i think that's one of the reasons
192:35 - why they're very successful
192:37 - but you can train yourself to sort of be
192:39 - like that you got to check your emotions
192:41 - at the door
192:42 - and never get too emotional in business
192:44 - and remember warren buffett
192:46 - said the new york stock exchange
192:48 - is the only store in the world where
192:49 - consumers sell stuff and it goes on sale
192:52 - i want you to be unemotional
192:54 - and i'm a very positive person however
192:58 - when things go incredibly well for you i
193:00 - don't want you to high-five and throw a
193:03 - big party et cetera unless it's a
193:05 - massive milestone whatever in business
193:07 - i want you stay level-headed
193:10 - and you got to stay level-headed because
193:12 - if the opposite happens
193:14 - you'll freak out
193:16 - check your emotions at the door
193:19 - be unemotional about business always
193:21 - always always
193:23 - uh and you can condition yourself to do
193:25 - that too
193:26 - like when i come home from work i
193:28 - condition myself so that when i touch
193:30 - the front door
193:31 - and start to turn it
193:34 - i leave all my stress and thoughts about
193:36 - work at work
193:38 - inside my house it's a sacred temple my
193:41 - kids christine my kids and i my family
193:45 - but i conditioned myself that way and
193:46 - you can condition yourself as well to
193:48 - check your emotions at the door
193:50 - when you show up to work even so you're
193:51 - not emotional especially when it comes
193:53 - to finance
193:54 - yeah
193:56 - all right next up is the most important
193:59 - investment characteristic which you can
194:01 - probably guess here
194:02 - has to do with horses
194:05 - the jockey me and the dude on top of the
194:07 - horse the jockey is more important than
194:09 - the horse and what that means is
194:11 - the management team or the founder or
194:14 - founders they're more important than the
194:15 - business model the horse is the business
194:17 - model in this analogy
194:18 - okay always remember that always always
194:21 - always and
194:22 - when you assess a management team
194:24 - um make sure that they get you excited
194:28 - about the vision they paint for you so
194:30 - to speak or the dream they're selling to
194:32 - you
194:33 - because
194:34 - the business model will change if it's
194:36 - an early stage company
194:38 - but i want you to be incredibly
194:40 - passionate because the potential
194:42 - investor
194:43 - that's watching you present
194:46 - they're thinking themselves
194:47 - does this person get me excited deep
194:49 - down in my belly
194:51 - about this business opportunity
194:54 - and i know
194:56 - that that business opportunity that the
194:57 - market will probably change one day but
194:59 - i want to know that this this this
195:01 - person that's trying to sell me the idea
195:03 - will be able to sell me on another idea
195:06 - or be able to adapt and get me excited
195:08 - about another
195:10 - business model or whatever it might be
195:12 - or new product they might be offering a
195:13 - new service
195:14 - if i invest if i invest
195:17 - and as mark cuban said
195:19 - ideas are commodities by execution is
195:21 - not
195:22 - and mark cuban is is the dude that
195:24 - he sold um broadcast.com
195:27 - uh to youtube for or pardon me to yahoo
195:30 - for several billion dollars in the late
195:32 - 90s and
195:35 - that could have been youtube actually
195:36 - but it wasn't they messed up the
195:38 - acquisition
195:39 - but mark cuban also said
195:41 - you only have to be right in business
195:44 - one time
195:45 - so just remember that when you keep
195:47 - trying to write different business plans
195:49 - if you fail a couple times
195:51 - so what
195:52 - you will be successful eventually and i
195:54 - don't have to read you that that quote
195:56 - on the wall uh with michael jordan there
195:58 - yeah you get it
196:00 - okay next up we've got um yeah hire
196:04 - slowly and and fire quickly so
196:08 - when you hire somebody
196:10 - the best way to do it is to
196:13 - really over interview
196:15 - um and so
196:16 - like when i worked at goldman sachs like
196:18 - the smartest people in the world didn't
196:20 - work there i mean they hired me
196:21 - but they they hired people that really
196:23 - got along well
196:26 - and we had to go through a gazillion
196:28 - interviews a ton of them like 40
196:30 - sometimes 40 or 50. it was nuts
196:32 - but the jerk factor is very very low
196:35 - and they took their time thank god
196:37 - because
196:37 - one stupid
196:39 - or one employee with with a bad attitude
196:42 - i should say can destroy
196:44 - an entire company it's true you've all
196:47 - been doing you've done group projects in
196:49 - school or at work where there's one jerk
196:52 - that just destroys everything it's not
196:54 - worth it it's not worth it so when you
196:56 - interview people i want you to make sure
196:59 - that they are interviewed multiple times
197:01 - in different settings
197:03 - under different amounts of pressure and
197:04 - i say with love my heart
197:06 - so interview them maybe at a breakfast
197:08 - meeting
197:09 - uh do a two-on-one lunch meeting uh have
197:12 - them present to five or six people in
197:14 - your company if you have that many
197:15 - people
197:15 - um you know go out maybe for dinner with
197:18 - them and their spouse
197:19 - um and see them in all aspects of their
197:21 - life
197:22 - because they can't act the whole time
197:25 - you know if if they're the salty earth
197:26 - they're good people
197:28 - um you'll know you'll know and usually i
197:30 - know within 30 seconds
197:32 - um whether or not i trust them and go
197:34 - with your gut too
197:36 - because you learn
197:38 - by by you know by through business over
197:41 - over many decades
197:42 - that your gut is often right and we've
197:45 - all gotten burned in our personal lives
197:47 - and professional lives too
197:49 - and we end up telling ourselves you know
197:51 - fool me once shame on you fool me twice
197:54 - shame on me go with your gut go with
197:56 - your gut because a lot of times you're
197:59 - when you get screwed over in business or
198:01 - personally speaking when you're younger
198:03 - remember when you broke your heart the
198:04 - first time it hurt and it never hurt
198:06 - that bad again right you kind of learn
198:08 - you kind of learn um and and in
198:11 - hindsight after you get screwed over in
198:12 - business or personally you tell yourself
198:14 - damn it i knew
198:16 - i knew
198:17 - go with your gut go with your gut but
198:19 - take a long time to hire people and when
198:22 - you're interviewing people
198:23 - make sure
198:25 - that
198:26 - you feel it in your heart
198:28 - that they're not interviewing for a job
198:30 - they're interviewing for a passion
198:32 - okay and they'll be way more productive
198:34 - that way trust me on this
198:36 - the difference between hiring an average
198:39 - engineer and an incredible engineer
198:42 - is 10 times more in performance
198:47 - and a lot of engineers actually they
198:48 - love what they do you know they just
198:50 - they're they're they're nerds they they
198:52 - love they grew up like like i did you
198:53 - know playing video games
198:55 - i was gonna include this i don't know i
198:57 - guess i didn't but this was uh
198:59 - i guess this is the the first um
199:01 - joystick i had for my um this is the
199:04 - apple
199:05 - predecessor that with the apple 2e
199:07 - actually but a lot of a lot of people
199:08 - that are engineers and nice to be a
199:10 - software engineer too
199:11 - we grew up loving it like these are some
199:13 - of the programs that i i you know i
199:15 - developed for microsoft and other stuff
199:17 - too but i loved it man it was fun
199:20 - you know and that's why a lot of
199:21 - technology companies do well
199:23 - because the people are so passionate
199:25 - about what they're doing
199:26 - they just love it
199:28 - so make sure that whoever you're
199:29 - interviewing
199:31 - is just as passionate as you are
199:34 - they've got to love it they've got to
199:35 - absolutely love it
199:37 - otherwise if it feels like a job then
199:40 - you'll you'll never put your dent in the
199:41 - universe as a company
199:44 - all right oh actually let me let me go
199:45 - back here um
199:47 - yeah so higher slowly and fire quickly
199:51 - um let me talk a little bit more about
199:54 - um about firing i i talked about it
199:56 - briefly and i remember the first time i
199:58 - had to fire somebody it was it was hell
200:00 - and obviously it was way harder for the
200:02 - person that i let go
200:04 - and i didn't know what the hell to do
200:06 - and i was nervous
200:08 - and and it sounds stupid for me saying
200:10 - this because it sucks that i'd let the
200:12 - other person go but you have to do it
200:15 - and so what i did was i called um one of
200:17 - my good friends i went to mcgill with a
200:19 - guy named mike ball
200:21 - he was my fraternity too great guy
200:23 - and and i asked him because his dad was
200:26 - the head of hr uh human resources at att
200:29 - or ncr for years
200:31 - and i asked him how do i do it
200:34 - and and he helped me out with some
200:36 - advice and and i took what he told me
200:38 - and a bunch of other
200:40 - top silicon valley entrepreneurs i ask
200:42 - their feedback i always over prepare for
200:44 - everything
200:45 - and here's the greatest it's what i
200:46 - learned
200:48 - when you let somebody go
200:50 - you do it on a monday like i mentioned
200:51 - before you sit down with them
200:54 - and what you do is this
200:56 - a bit repetitive here i'm sorry but i
200:58 - have to do it
201:00 - you start off by saying something
201:02 - genuinely nice
201:05 - and you do it like this
201:08 - john
201:11 - i just want to let you know that we
201:13 - really appreciate
201:15 - the great job you've done on the x
201:17 - project making that up
201:19 - and you know
201:20 - everybody loves you here and you know
201:22 - times are tough
201:24 - but due to the the fact that and then
201:26 - this is where you mentioned what they
201:28 - did wrong
201:29 - that you missed your i'm gonna make it
201:30 - up you missed your quota
201:32 - three quarters in a row
201:34 - we have to let you go
201:37 - then you pause and you say nothing
201:41 - you pause
201:42 - and dude it feels like freaking eternity
201:45 - just waiting sometimes
201:46 - you say nothing
201:49 - and then they'll
201:51 - they'll say something
201:53 - um
201:54 - a lot of times they'll know like they'll
201:56 - kind of they figure it out it's
201:57 - happening you know
201:59 - like when they're they're called into
202:00 - the meeting on a monday
202:02 - they know they know or at least they
202:04 - have a hunch and they probably know it's
202:06 - coming because they haven't been
202:07 - performing as well it's usually not a
202:09 - massive surprise sometimes it is
202:12 - and then you just wait
202:14 - and they might say something rightly so
202:17 - about you know what about my family and
202:19 - that sort of thing and then you you have
202:21 - a file there
202:23 - and you say well we prepared for you uh
202:25 - these these benefits uh and you wanna be
202:27 - very generous of course
202:29 - and if it's a bigger company you'll have
202:31 - somebody from human resources
202:33 - in the room as well
202:36 - and if you don't know what to do and
202:38 - it's a tiny company it's just you and
202:40 - somebody else or a couple people you can
202:42 - always get a lawyer to help you call
202:44 - them and ask them how do i do this you
202:46 - have to do it the right way
202:48 - and
202:50 - then what happens and most of the time
202:51 - people are cool about it but i've been
202:53 - in situations where
202:55 - a colleague of mine was let go
202:57 - and they had to call security
203:01 - and you can always get a security guard
203:04 - uh you can you can
203:06 - hire one
203:07 - or you can get somebody in a bigger
203:09 - company uh to be standing by
203:12 - just outside the room just in case just
203:14 - in case
203:15 - and if they're a bit abrasive uh or you
203:17 - know the person that you let go
203:19 - um
203:21 - you can always say
203:23 - and you could be firm you know if
203:24 - they're being really pushy you could say
203:27 - do i have to call security
203:30 - like that like that so anyway and then
203:33 - what happens usually is they
203:35 - they look at the paperwork quickly and
203:37 - and then they they shake your hand
203:39 - that's it
203:40 - yeah
203:41 - yeah
203:43 - and you got to be careful too because if
203:44 - you let go and it's happened to
203:46 - everybody happen to me
203:48 - um if you're let go
203:50 - if you're not careful
203:53 - and if if you're abrasive or a jerk well
203:56 - first of all you're gonna make it easier
203:57 - for them to let you go
203:59 - but if you're a jerk about it
204:01 - good luck getting another job
204:04 - because that's your reference whoever
204:05 - lets you go is your former boss
204:08 - that's your reference
204:09 - so be good about it like when i was let
204:11 - go
204:12 - i didn't like
204:14 - my boss he put his hand out
204:16 - uh and
204:18 - i didn't shake it i gave him a hug
204:21 - and i hugged him so hard i broke
204:23 - all his ribs no i'm just kidding i'm
204:24 - just kidding
204:25 - it was bogus um
204:27 - i i made the firm money i have no idea
204:30 - what happened but i was strategic um i
204:32 - think he was threatened by me but it is
204:34 - what it is
204:35 - but i'm so glad it happened because in
204:36 - hindsight many many many many years
204:38 - later i look back i'm like thank you god
204:40 - for guiding me down that path a
204:42 - different path
204:44 - sometimes you won't understand in life
204:46 - why things happen and then years later
204:48 - you look back and you'll say
204:50 - you know what as painful as that was
204:52 - professionally for me it was the best
204:54 - thing that could have happened to me
204:55 - because it forced me down this path here
205:00 - so um but just yeah be careful on your
205:02 - way out and and
205:05 - if any of you have left a company
205:08 - and
205:09 - you didn't live on leave on great terms
205:11 - and somebody asked for a reference
205:13 - you don't have to get your old boss as a
205:15 - reference you can always have a former
205:17 - colleague
205:18 - a buddy of yours who can even write a
205:20 - nice recommendation on linkedin
205:23 - so that's just food for thought yeah uh
205:26 - and when you let people go you gotta
205:29 - you gotta let them go fast
205:32 - it's so hard
205:34 - and after you let them go say you wait
205:36 - six months too long
205:38 - after you let them go you're like damn
205:39 - it they hurt productivity i should let
205:41 - them go way way before way way way way
205:43 - earlier it's so hard though man it's
205:45 - i've got a big heart
205:47 - um but at the same time you got to put
205:49 - business first
205:51 - and if it if it ever
205:53 - if your heart gets in the way of
205:55 - business sometimes just think to
205:56 - yourself this is all things to say but i
205:58 - have to
205:59 - you're hurting your family if you don't
206:00 - do it sooner
206:02 - and you're hurting them as well because
206:04 - they're rotting away at work
206:06 - when they could be doing something else
206:08 - they're more passionate about
206:10 - and i know it doesn't make sense to a
206:12 - lot of us right now
206:13 - but many years later you'll look back
206:16 - and
206:17 - you might be glad
206:18 - that you were let go yeah
206:24 - all right
206:28 - okay next up um we've got touch hand
206:32 - only once
206:34 - um i didn't know what icon to use here
206:36 - what graphics so
206:37 - i found like an old file cabinet thing
206:40 - because
206:41 - i got this one from my dad
206:43 - and this is old school device it's great
206:45 - though
206:46 - he said
206:48 - if you ever
206:51 - if you ever write a letter
206:53 - and
206:54 - you're a little bit negative in the
206:55 - letter
206:57 - or mean by accident or whatever it is
206:59 - and if you're emotional
207:02 - don't mail that letter yet
207:04 - take that letter my dad he's he's arabic
207:06 - from egypt he'd say take the letter put
207:09 - it in the drawer
207:11 - and then i can't do his accent well i'm
207:13 - sorry but
207:14 - open it the next day the drawer next
207:16 - morning after you sleep on it and if you
207:18 - still feel the same way after you read
207:19 - it then send it
207:21 - and that's great advice it's great
207:22 - advice because
207:24 - in this digital reality now
207:27 - um
207:29 - you could send an email when you're in a
207:31 - crap mood
207:33 - and
207:34 - destroy your life
207:35 - or hurt your career a lot
207:37 - and what i used to do is i used to have
207:38 - christine who's my wife and my shrink
207:40 - and my wife and my shrink
207:43 - um she um i used to ever read some of my
207:45 - emails i'm like did i sound
207:47 - how's the tone here that sort of thing
207:49 - because things can be really
207:50 - misinterpreted you know like if somebody
207:52 - types in all caps which i never do but
207:54 - it's like they're yelling and usually
207:56 - with almost all my emails since day one
207:59 - i use the word please and thank you and
208:01 - all it's just on my birth thanks
208:03 - something i've always done yeah
208:06 - touch hand only once
208:08 - yeah yeah oh my god i think i screwed
208:10 - that up but screw it let me go back
208:12 - there
208:13 - i meant to say something else there but
208:15 - that was good advice screw it we'll keep
208:16 - that in there it's fine
208:18 - touch hand only once i'm such an idiot
208:21 - it's an old school business thing which
208:23 - is this in the old days you used to get
208:25 - inter-office memos and there's a string
208:27 - on it you unwrap open the envelope
208:29 - and the best business people in the
208:30 - world will say
208:32 - when a memo comes in your hand or an
208:34 - email or whatever it is
208:36 - only let it touch your hand one time
208:40 - and take care of everything right away
208:41 - if you can unless it's something that's
208:43 - gonna take forever to do and i've
208:45 - adopted that actually in many aspects of
208:46 - my life
208:48 - and this is gonna sound out there but it
208:49 - saves me time
208:51 - when i make a salad at night and i love
208:54 - salad with oil and vinegar and salt and
208:56 - pepper and i have this awesome uh bagel
208:59 - spice it's it's it's it's what you put
209:01 - on everything bagels but it's a spice i
209:02 - get it from trader joe's the best ever
209:06 - but i only let all those things touch my
209:07 - hand once so i open the cupboard up once
209:10 - and i take all those out at the same
209:11 - time once
209:13 - you put them all back in at once right i
209:15 - know it sounds silly
209:17 - but if you use that mentality you will
209:19 - save a ton of time a ton of time
209:22 - so
209:23 - touch hand only once
209:25 - okay
209:27 - all right so now i want you to please go
209:29 - to your workbook
209:31 - and click on number 10 meaning section
209:34 - 10
209:35 - on the front page
209:36 - and then i want you to take three
209:37 - minutes please
209:39 - and write down notes on how you can
209:41 - apply the lessons in section 10 to
209:44 - enhance your career or make you happier
209:46 - you've got three minutes go
209:56 - [Music]
210:23 - [Music]
210:36 - do
210:40 - [Music]
211:01 - [Music]
211:19 - [Music]
211:39 - [Music]
212:01 - do
212:02 - [Music]
212:18 - [Music]
212:45 - all right let's move on now to section
212:47 - number 11
212:49 - which is called navigating corporate
212:50 - politics and swimming with sharks yeah
212:55 - all right
212:56 - so
212:57 - the first one here is keep that letter
213:00 - in your drawer i i i'm such an idiot i
213:03 - jumped the gun i already talked about
213:05 - this one so i'm just gonna skip it okay
213:06 - but just keep in mind that
213:08 - a lot of times in business
213:11 - you don't get to the next level because
213:13 - of politics which sucks and i'm going to
213:15 - give you some i guess some some tips
213:17 - here
213:18 - on how to um
213:20 - how to swim with the shark so to speak
213:22 - as much as i hate that
213:24 - so
213:25 - religion and politics
213:27 - leave them at home
213:29 - don't ever talk about them in work ever
213:32 - ever ever
213:33 - because the way that politics works
213:36 - usually in most countries there's two
213:37 - parties
213:38 - party one or party two you know or
213:41 - sometimes there's three like in canada
213:43 - there's there's a bunch actually there's
213:45 - progressive conservative which is like
213:46 - right wing relatively speaking
213:48 - you got liberals and then you've got um
213:51 - ndp
213:52 - which i can't stand i mean ndp yeah
213:55 - which is uh
213:56 - they're more socialist yeah yeah
213:58 - sorry about that sort of
214:01 - and in america you've got republicans
214:04 - and democrats and republicans means that
214:06 - you're more right-wing and democrats
214:08 - means that you're less right-wing you're
214:09 - more left-wing
214:11 - and i live here in california on the
214:12 - left coast
214:14 - get myself in trouble there i gotta be
214:15 - careful
214:16 - but
214:17 - if you tell people what your political
214:19 - affiliation is and i think i'm probably
214:21 - a libertarian i believe in the power of
214:23 - the individual and that you can
214:25 - accomplish anything so i'm less so
214:27 - married to these parties although i will
214:29 - swap every now and then okay
214:32 - but if you tell somebody that you're in
214:34 - one part you like one type of politician
214:38 - then half the people will hate you or
214:40 - not like you as much i don't know what
214:41 - half
214:42 - but just be careful it's not worth it so
214:44 - what do you do when politics come up at
214:46 - work
214:48 - well you just
214:50 - don't talk
214:52 - if a bunch of people are around
214:54 - or if somebody tries to bait you into it
214:56 - you can say two words
214:58 - i understand
215:00 - and that won't let them know that you're
215:03 - one with one party or the other party i
215:05 - i understand that will help
215:07 - uh and religion is is is tough it's
215:10 - tough um
215:11 - it's really really hard because i am
215:13 - really passionate about stuff but
215:15 - and i'm
215:16 - i'm very respectful of every religion on
215:18 - the planet
215:20 - but just be careful at class or at uh at
215:23 - um at work getting nervous now yeah yeah
215:26 - just be careful yeah
215:29 - all right next up is um unjustified
215:32 - criticism is a disguised compliment i
215:35 - had to mention this one twice okay and
215:36 - so yeah if somebody
215:38 - criticizes you unfairly you got to tell
215:40 - yourself
215:42 - thanks man
215:44 - like don't say it out loud it'll drive
215:46 - them nuts
215:47 - um
215:49 - don't say it out loud it'll it won't
215:51 - help you
215:53 - but just tell that to yourself and your
215:55 - mind and that will say it is
215:57 - yeah
215:58 - yeah so remember that
216:01 - unjustify and write it down please write
216:04 - it down
216:05 - unjustified criticism is a disguised
216:07 - compliment
216:08 - that will add years to your life it'll
216:10 - take away a lot of stress in your heart
216:13 - and your mind as well
216:14 - yeah
216:16 - all right um what do we have next number
216:19 - number 54.
216:21 - come on slides move faster there we go
216:23 - good all right next one is um how to
216:26 - talk buying people's backs
216:28 - and that's um
216:29 - looks like a nail file but i it's it's
216:32 - actually a butter knife um
216:34 - i didn't want to have a real real knife
216:36 - whatever but the best way is not to do
216:38 - it at all i know it sounds silly and
216:40 - you're like chris seriously like i'm an
216:41 - adult here right i know
216:44 - but don't get tied into that like office
216:47 - gossip like stay away from gossip at the
216:49 - office
216:50 - um
216:52 - like sometimes it's you're around the
216:54 - water cooler and somebody will be
216:55 - gossiping you're like yeah yeah you're
216:57 - interested in hearing it
216:59 - but just don't don't be a part of that
217:01 - people won't trust you and if you gossip
217:03 - even a little bit about somebody at work
217:05 - they'll appreciate hearing it
217:07 - but they won't trust you
217:09 - you know it's like somebody that
217:10 - backstabs their wife or their husband
217:12 - you know says something bad about them
217:14 - um you're like dude i can never trust
217:16 - you
217:18 - so stay away from gossip at work it's
217:22 - not worth it it's not worth it at all
217:24 - yeah
217:26 - all right next up is
217:28 - observe and then make your move
217:30 - so every company has a slightly
217:32 - different corporate culture and every
217:33 - team does
217:34 - and every board does as well
217:37 - so when you join a new company
217:40 - i don't want you to make your move right
217:43 - away and try to really impress people
217:44 - right away
217:45 - hear me out
217:47 - i want you to question things at first
217:49 - like question in your mind
217:51 - and really observe how the system works
217:54 - because every company's a little bit
217:55 - different
217:56 - you know
217:57 - and be nice to the assistants please
218:00 - anybody that isn't is an
218:02 - plus the assistants have been there
218:03 - longer than most people and they
218:05 - probably worked with their boss at the
218:07 - previous company as well and they know
218:08 - how to get stuff done
218:10 - and if you confide in them
218:12 - and get them to mentor you they'll love
218:14 - it
218:14 - they'll trust you you'll trust them and
218:16 - they'll help you with your career
218:18 - yeah yeah you can really
218:21 - you can really understand what kind of a
218:22 - person somebody is or how much jerk they
218:24 - are by how they treat assistance
218:27 - so observe
218:28 - observe how the system works at first
218:30 - before making your move you got one shot
218:32 - to really impress people just sit back a
218:34 - bit don't be lazy
218:36 - but don't talk up too much initially
218:38 - just observe how it works you know
218:40 - quietly
218:41 - observe the system because every com
218:44 - every company is is a little bit
218:45 - different a little bit different yeah
218:49 - all right next up is the army promotes
218:51 - you because of this um so
218:55 - it's so hard sometimes to to deal with
218:58 - authority and
219:00 - not talk back and just do what you're
219:02 - told to do and
219:04 - but sometimes if you
219:06 - if you kind of follow blindly i hate to
219:09 - say
219:10 - sometimes it helps you with your career
219:12 - a lot uh and you might be frustrated but
219:14 - it in the long run it'll it'll pay off
219:16 - because you'll get what you want and if
219:17 - you're frustrated enough you can leave
219:18 - anyway but the biggest thing here is
219:20 - that
219:22 - when i used to work in consultant
219:25 - it was kind of like the army
219:27 - you know it's when there's a war the
219:29 - troops go and fight where the war is
219:31 - if you're a consultant
219:33 - you're sent wherever the client is
219:35 - wherever all the any any it might be a
219:37 - different country and i've been all over
219:38 - the place doing that many countries
219:40 - and
219:42 - there's actually um
219:44 - there's a guy who who used to be the
219:46 - co-chairman of goldman sachs
219:49 - and he actually came and lectured at
219:51 - columbia university
219:53 - uh and i think his name was uh was was
219:56 - stephen levitt i think yeah
219:58 - um actually i gotta go find out right
220:00 - now because his son actually is the guy
220:02 - that wrote game of thrones
220:04 - let me let me go here here sorry i i
220:06 - have to find out right now
220:07 - uh but but i remember he was there and i
220:11 - was in new york and i was about to join
220:14 - goldman and goldman wanted me to start
220:16 - my career in tokyo
220:17 - and and i didn't want to go
220:19 - and so what i did um
220:23 - hold on a second bend the office guy's
220:24 - last name i'll talk about this guys
220:26 - what i did was it was i said to him i'll
220:28 - get that second
220:30 - i said do i really have to go
220:32 - and he stared me down in front of
220:34 - everybody there's like 60 people in the
220:35 - class said
220:37 - yes you do
220:39 - so if you want to get promoted to a
220:40 - senior senior level in companies
220:42 - sometimes you have to move if they tell
220:44 - you to move it sucks
220:46 - uh but but if you do that you take one
220:48 - for the team
220:49 - but don't go
220:51 - unless you get something promised in
220:52 - return
220:54 - you know basically say i'll go but i
220:56 - want to make sure i get promoted
220:58 - and you can hold up you can kind of use
221:00 - that card and they'll promote you as
221:02 - they send you
221:04 - um but this guy's name um
221:06 - the guy that wrote like game of thrones
221:08 - uh he um okay so he was the the
221:10 - screenwriter david benioff
221:13 - and his dad was a professor steven
221:15 - somebody i gotta know because he changed
221:16 - his last name benioff yeah steven
221:18 - friedman it was steven friedman yeah
221:20 - yeah he changed his last name from
221:22 - benioff to friedman because there's lots
221:23 - of david friedman that are writers but
221:26 - that's his dad yeah his dad was um
221:28 - goldman sachs where is he getting here
221:30 - now now i'm curious stephen friedman
221:33 - that's right here is the guy this is the
221:35 - guy that that stared me down yeah yeah
221:37 - then eventually he went into government
221:39 - because
221:40 - at goldman sachs i worked at goldman for
221:41 - years and i understand after i left why
221:43 - so many successful politicians from
221:45 - goldman sachs er come out of uh by so
221:48 - many successful politicians come out of
221:49 - goldman sachs yeah yeah it's tough place
221:51 - to work but it's fun too i'm proud it's
221:53 - on my resume and again they don't have
221:55 - the smartest people in the world
221:57 - way off track okay anyway

222:34 - he started bloomberg and he was mayor of
222:36 - new york whatever for a while that's
222:38 - what he did early in his career
222:40 - he would show up for anybody
222:42 - and um
222:43 - yeah that that's base time was important
222:45 - i got that one from him actually yeah
222:47 - he's done quite well
222:49 - all right next up is dta which stands
222:52 - for don't trust anyone
222:55 - sharks are tough to spot sometimes it's
222:58 - so true it's so true
223:00 - um
223:02 - usu when you go with your gut usually
223:03 - you can tell somebody's a shark but
223:05 - sometimes you don't know like if push
223:07 - comes to shove
223:08 - and you're competing with somebody get
223:09 - promoted at work
223:11 - um
223:12 - don't trust them man
223:14 - don't trust anyone like just be really
223:16 - really careful
223:17 - like don't date anybody at work either
223:19 - ever unless you're sure it's uh if
223:20 - you're positive this is the one this is
223:22 - the one yeah just be careful dta don't
223:25 - trust anyone okay
223:26 - and i debated whether i include this one
223:28 - or not and actually in my book i renamed
223:30 - this chapter it was it was chapter 59 in
223:32 - the paperback version and the kindle
223:34 - version
223:35 - um and i actually changed the title
223:37 - because i angered people then i'm
223:39 - including it now so it's good i don't
223:40 - care
223:41 - so um
223:43 - a valuable lesson about donald trump
223:46 - so
223:48 - and when i wrote this book is before
223:49 - trump got elected but but years ago i i
223:52 - read i read
223:53 - a book from trump called uh the art of
223:56 - the deal and this guy can get a deal
223:57 - done
223:58 - he can't nice let's be intellectually
224:00 - honest he can't especially in business
224:03 - but he said something um
224:05 - years ago that made a lot of sense and
224:07 - when i first heard it i thought oh my
224:08 - god that's
224:10 - i don't know if i agree but he said
224:12 - you have to remind people
224:15 - of your accomplishments
224:16 - otherwise you'll never reach
224:18 - you know your
224:19 - highest your potential in life
224:23 - and as a canadian you know growing up
224:25 - we're very humble whatever it just
224:27 - wasn't our nature
224:28 - you know um
224:31 - you know wayne gretzky used to say
224:34 - when when
224:35 - when you when you lose say nothing
224:38 - when you win say even less
224:41 - but but trump is right trump is right um
224:44 - if you don't remind people of of your
224:45 - accomplishments you'll never get
224:46 - promoted
224:47 - uh you'll never get you'll never be able
224:49 - to raise money
224:51 - you'll never get customers you got to
224:53 - remind people and and sometimes it's as
224:55 - simple as you're trying to get a big
224:56 - contract
224:57 - in your sales person
224:59 - you have to remind the person that
225:01 - you're meeting with after you bond
225:04 - which other big contracts you've signed
225:06 - in the past big reference customers if
225:09 - you're allowed to disclose it
225:11 - and you have to brag about your
225:12 - accomplishments as well
225:14 - um and there's ways to do it like
225:17 - i'm going to brag in a second
225:20 - and and you'll see how i'm going to brag
225:22 - and it won't come across as as being a
225:24 - big brag here we go oh my god i talk a
225:26 - lot
225:29 - i'm humbled to say
225:31 - that i think
225:32 - that i'm a very good judging character
225:35 - so you i i through the beginning part
225:37 - and i'm humbled to say that you know
225:38 - whatever uh but yeah and trump certainly
225:41 - doesn't do it that way
225:43 - uh but if you don't um
225:45 - if you don't remind people your
225:46 - accomplishments you'll never get a
225:47 - promotion
225:48 - you won't
225:49 - you'll never get a raise you'll let you
225:51 - never get a job you'll never get
225:52 - anything in life
225:53 - you have to do it you have to it's going
225:55 - to be humble but at times you have to
225:57 - brag it's a do or die mentality
226:02 - okay
226:03 - uh and and yeah here um ask often how am
226:06 - i doing how am i doing and i got this
226:08 - one from another goldman sachs partner
226:10 - that i met with
226:12 - when i was at coleman you have to ask
226:14 - how am i doing often not all the time
226:16 - but every month or two
226:19 - meet with your manager and ask her him
226:21 - you know okay you know i really enjoy
226:23 - being here at the hermitage or whatever
226:26 - you know what i mean
226:28 - i'd love you can please provide me some
226:29 - feedback on on how i can contribute more
226:31 - to the team
226:32 - even more at the time
226:35 - and they'll start off by saying positive
226:38 - things if they're a good manager and
226:39 - then they'll tell you additional things
226:41 - that you can do
226:43 - and you can even ask them was it you
226:45 - know to get promoted to the next level
226:48 - like what else do i need to do what else
226:50 - do i need to do
226:51 - and they'll tell you and once you
226:53 - accomplish that stuff remind them
226:55 - when they're in a good mood it's kind of
226:57 - like asking mom and dad for something
226:58 - only when they're in a good mood remind
227:00 - them that when you've accomplished those
227:01 - things so you can get that promotion
227:03 - but you have to ask how i'm doing often
227:05 - and if you do that you'll most likely
227:07 - never get fired or at least surprised uh
227:10 - and fired yeah always ask for feedback
227:13 - otherwise
227:14 - you just don't know how good of a job
227:16 - you're doing
227:20 - all right um and the only way to get
227:22 - promoted or a raise
227:24 - and i was looking for the energizer
227:26 - bunny i couldn't find it so i threw the
227:27 - durabell
227:28 - duracell battery in which takes a
227:30 - licking and keeps on ticking that's what
227:32 - they used to say i think so or is that
227:34 - time asked can't remember
227:36 - uh but the bottom line is you just got
227:38 - to be relentless you got to be
227:39 - relentless and
227:41 - ask over and over and over and over and
227:43 - over and over again to get a raise or
227:46 - promotion and there's tactful ways to do
227:48 - it too and you don't have to be annoying
227:50 - about it
227:51 - um or piss off your manager
227:53 - you meet with them every couple months
227:54 - and when you ask how am i doing
227:56 - that's when you ask
227:58 - you know it and maybe you strike when
228:00 - they aaron's hot when you achieved a
228:01 - milestone and they give you great
228:03 - feedback
228:04 - then you you say awesome awesome
228:06 - do you have time for coffee now
228:08 - and you go for coffee uh and you'll say
228:11 - thank you very much for the kaufman i
228:12 - appreciate it it's it's been great being
228:14 - a member of this team and together we've
228:16 - accomplished a lot
228:17 - you know what i'm doing here right
228:19 - so that then you say well i'd love to
228:21 - ask you if it's okay
228:24 - what do i need to do and it's really
228:26 - making this it's really expensive living
228:29 - um here with the family and whatnot as
228:31 - you know and i have to provide and so
228:32 - i'm
228:33 - i'd love to ask you please
228:36 - what do i need to accomplish how much
228:38 - more how much about more value can i add
228:40 - and what kind of value can i add to the
228:42 - team
228:43 - in order to get a raise or a promotion
228:46 - and and they'll give you the criteria
228:49 - and the second you achieve those
228:51 - criteria
228:53 - and your boss is in a good mood and it's
228:55 - not too busy crazy at work
228:58 - it's a slow day meet with them and ask
229:01 - otherwise you won't get it you won't get
229:03 - it
229:04 - people that make ceo are ones that have
229:06 - asked that have asked many times to be
229:08 - promoted and many times for a race
229:11 - they're sales people they're selling
229:12 - themselves they're relentless
229:15 - and they brag as well about their
229:16 - accomplishments tactfully tactfully
229:20 - if you don't remind people of your
229:21 - accomplishments
229:22 - and if you don't ask for a raise or
229:24 - promotion
229:25 - you'll never get it you'll never get it
229:28 - it's kind of like when you were younger
229:30 - and you were in school
229:32 - you kept your head down
229:34 - and when
229:37 - when you did well in a test
229:39 - you were congratulated your parents are
229:41 - happy teachers are happy everyone's
229:43 - happy you were happy
229:45 - then you graduate and you start working
229:48 - and you keep your head down and you work
229:50 - hard and you do well
229:52 - and you think to yourself well
229:54 - somebody's going to notice me just like
229:56 - in school
229:57 - and then you look around you're like
229:59 - dude why are these people getting
230:00 - promoted instead of me i accomplished so
230:02 - much more than they did
230:03 - oh my gosh that guy got a big raise i
230:05 - didn't what's up with that
230:07 - it's because they asked
230:09 - so you gotta ask
230:12 - all right um next up is uh there is a
230:15 - plan b uh before you quit
230:18 - uh and that's by the way it's an
230:20 - american power conversion uh older
230:23 - backup battery i've got four of them
230:24 - here uh running just in case because i
230:26 - blew a fuse once or twice because of all
230:29 - this equipment and lights and stuff in
230:30 - the air conditioning too
230:32 - but i put it there because
230:34 - before you quit
230:36 - let's say you got a job a job offer from
230:38 - another company for more money and a
230:39 - better position whatever
230:42 - whoa that scared me
230:45 - sorry that was my alarm that remind me
230:47 - to put the kids to bed but there's no
230:49 - school tomorrow so it's fine we're good
230:50 - we're good
230:51 - um
230:52 - sorry about that
230:54 - so before you quit
230:57 - think to yourself why are you quitting
230:59 - you're probably quitting because this
231:01 - other
231:02 - company is paying you more money or this
231:04 - other company is giving you
231:06 - responsibilities that you enjoy more or
231:08 - this other company
231:09 - is giving you a different type of role
231:11 - in a different geographical location
231:13 - whatever it is
231:14 - you got nothing to lose
231:16 - so when when you go to tell your manager
231:18 - that you're resigning
231:20 - um just let them know that you've you've
231:22 - been offered a job
231:25 - and
231:26 - before quitting
231:29 - there's nothing wrong with asking them
231:31 - if they could
231:33 - match that offer
231:35 - or find you that other role internally
231:37 - so you can transfer
231:39 - you got nothing to lose nothing to lose
231:41 - and everything to gain
231:43 - okay
231:44 - uh next up is avoid this at all costs
231:49 - okay and duff beer what is duff beer
231:51 - from
231:52 - you got to tell you what duff beer is
231:54 - from um

232:02 - minute if you don't already know

232:12 - used to drink i don't drink anymore and
232:13 - not judging anybody it's fun
232:15 - but i want you to be careful and what my
232:18 - what my my grandfather god bless him he
232:21 - gave me advice as well
232:23 - um when i was going to my first job i
232:25 - asked him i asked a ton of people for
232:26 - advice and he said to me he said chi chi
232:29 - christie
232:31 - when you go to a corporate party
232:33 - if if you're forced to drink just take
232:35 - that drink whatever just i don't know
232:36 - when no one's looking throwing the
232:37 - plants
232:38 - yeah and i thought i'm not going to do
232:40 - that he said or what you can also do
232:42 - is just get a 7-up with lime in it or
232:46 - sprite with lime in it because that
232:48 - looks like a gin and tonic or something
232:49 - anyway
232:50 - just be careful with alcohol at work
232:52 - it's it's so weird because i used to go
232:54 - out and party whatever and i worked at
232:56 - hedge fund industry in different
232:57 - companies i had a blast like i have no
232:59 - regrets

233:06 - taught you today are humble lessons
233:07 - whatever like don't trust anyone
233:09 - whatever

233:24 - i'd rather you rise to the top
233:26 - um yeah

233:32 - there you go now you know where it's
233:33 - from now you know where it's from that
233:34 - that's that's uh mr burns
233:37 - uh front from the simpsons uh and he had

233:46 - that's funny
233:48 - so number 64. and i couldn't get the

233:51 - threw silver everywhere and had to
233:53 - recolor it but
233:54 - um
233:55 - number 64 is
233:57 - don't ever go over your boss's head

234:13 - and i've done it before just
234:15 - naively trying to help and i've added a
234:17 - ton of value
234:18 - and then my boss got jealous and
234:22 - yeah it happens
234:24 - just be careful
234:26 - however
234:30 - if you think you're going to be let go
234:33 - or if you work for a jerk
234:35 - and you got nothing to lose
234:37 - take that risk go to your boss's boss
234:40 - when your boss is not around add a
234:41 - tremendous amount of
234:44 - value i worked at a very big hedge fund
234:47 - once not gonna say which one
234:49 - and i got an offer from an even bigger
234:51 - hedge fund
234:53 - and
234:54 - the owner of the hedge fund that i was
234:56 - leaving said
234:58 - if you
234:58 - stay we might give you a more senior
235:01 - role and he was implying i guess i might
235:04 - get my boss's job
235:06 - i i didn't have the heart i can't do it
235:08 - i couldn't do it
235:10 - even though i've been for a heck of a
235:11 - lot more money i just can't it's not me
235:12 - it's not me but that option's there

236:31 - and um i think he was probably my age
236:34 - when he told me that's interesting wow

237:15 - that mindset
237:17 - you know it's
237:18 - it's kind of like when you're

242:09 - you know just take advice from people
242:10 - that have done what you want to do
242:13 - okay
242:15 - so less number 67 is you need yodas
242:18 - and i love this analogy
242:20 - uh yoda was a mentor for those that
242:23 - aren't star wars fans was a mentor
242:25 - to um luke skywalker
242:28 - and you need many yodas
242:30 - you need lots of mentors in your life
242:34 - and i want you to find people that
242:37 - work in the industry that you want to
242:39 - work in or currently working
242:41 - or people that
242:42 - have
242:43 - a perfect lifestyle that you want
242:46 - meaning they have a wonderful family
242:48 - life
242:50 - and
242:51 - they found work-life balance and they're
242:52 - successful and people love it when you
242:54 - ask them to mention them as well
242:56 - you gotta ask though right so you need
242:57 - to have
242:58 - many yodas and
243:00 - if you're working at a company now and
243:02 - you're not happy
243:04 - in the division you're in you've got to
243:06 - network internally and find mentors in
243:08 - different divisions and get them to pull
243:09 - you into their
243:11 - their team or if push comes to shove and
243:14 - there's a restructuring round and people
243:16 - are going to be let go including you
243:17 - maybe
243:18 - you can call your yoda in another
243:20 - department and ask them uh for help and
243:23 - hopefully they can pull you in you need
243:24 - yodas
243:26 - all right next up is i want you to
243:29 - follow people
243:31 - that
243:32 - inspire the heck out of you
243:34 - or are doing what you want to do one day
243:37 - or they're they're they're business
243:39 - tycoons they're amazingly successful
243:42 - and i put the graph there for audible
243:44 - which is owned by amazon
243:47 - and you can subscribe for a monthly fee
243:49 - uh i recommend doing it it's a great
243:51 - investment in yourself it's investment
243:53 - education and i want you to listen to um
243:55 - at least one or two books per month
243:58 - from successful people
244:00 - autobiographies
244:01 - or biographies if you can't find them
244:04 - and if you can find them where the the
244:05 - person that that wrote it if it's an
244:07 - autobiography narrates it themselves
244:10 - like so richard branson that's even
244:11 - better
244:12 - because
244:13 - you can hear their positivity in their
244:15 - voice and people really let their cards
244:17 - down once they've achieved success and
244:20 - they want to share success and help you
244:22 - to kind of pay that debt of gratitude
244:24 - forward so to speak
244:26 - so seek people
244:28 - find people that have written books or
244:31 - find the book names or whatever or or
244:33 - the business tycoons or icons
244:35 - and listen to their books
244:37 - so that you can understand their
244:38 - blueprint and why reinvent the wheel
244:40 - they're going to help you do it anyway
244:42 - they've done it
244:43 - they've done it
244:44 - and i'd love you all to one day

244:55 - i've never never met a successful person
244:58 - with
244:59 - a negative attitude
245:01 - and that there is uh one of searcher
245:03 - branson's companies uh virgin atlantic
245:06 - uh is
245:08 - i've never met anybody that's really
245:10 - really really successful in business
245:13 - that doesn't have a positive attitude
245:15 - because there's so much working against
245:17 - you there's so many naysayers around you
245:19 - saying you can't do it you can't do you
245:20 - can't do it don't take a risk you might
245:22 - fail people will laugh at you

245:29 - that are really positive really positive
245:31 - people make it big
245:33 - so if you're not a positive person it
245:35 - might be because you're hanging out with

249:31 - [Music]
249:39 - next up let's talk about section number
249:41 - 13 which is called only the paranoid
249:43 - survive
249:44 - uh it's crucial to be paranoid about the
249:46 - issues i'm going to talk about in a
249:48 - second
249:49 - and as you can tell there the one there
249:52 - uh in the 13
249:53 - those are those are chips and i've
249:56 - actually got it right here let me go off
249:58 - script
250:03 - it's a
250:04 - it's a pentium processor
250:07 - so
250:08 - i have those chips there in the 13 and
250:11 - it's from intel because there's a
250:13 - brilliant man
250:15 - uh
250:16 - who passed away recently god bless him
250:17 - he's one of the co-founders of intel um
250:19 - in his name is andy grove and he wrote a
250:22 - great book that you guys should read
250:24 - called only the paranoid survive
250:27 - and he was so paranoid running intel
250:31 - and
250:33 - intel is is a company that makes chips
250:35 - we all know that
250:36 - but what many of us forget or didn't
250:38 - know
250:39 - as documented in his book which came out
250:41 - in 95 95 or 96 i think i loved it
250:45 - intel back in the 80s and the 70s
250:48 - uh they made uh ram
250:51 - right which is random access memory uh
250:53 - which basically is
250:54 - a commoditized industry there are little
250:56 - chips that allow your computers to have
250:58 - more programs open at once
251:01 - and what happened was that the japanese
251:03 - were so competitive with intel in the
251:05 - early 80s
251:07 - in japanese companies at that time
251:09 - they were more interested in market
251:11 - share
251:12 - than they were in profit margin
251:14 - and so they they basically flooded the
251:17 - market with cheap ram
251:19 - and
251:20 - it intel could have gone out of business
251:23 - and so what happened was uh andy grove
251:27 - he he pivoted and he made the company
251:29 - focus on a new product for them
251:32 - called the intel processor they had
251:34 - what's called the 286 and 386 and 486
251:37 - and pentium and all that stuff whatever
251:39 - you probably heard that in the past uh
251:40 - but andy grove was was very very
251:42 - paranoid
251:43 - uh of the competition and bill gates was
251:46 - the same way too when he was running
251:47 - microsoft
251:49 - bill gates used to say that microsoft is
251:51 - always one and a half years away from
251:54 - bankruptcy he even said that in the 90s
251:56 - and of course we we know that there's no
251:58 - way it would go bankrupt within a year
251:59 - and a half
252:00 - but that's how paranoid he was
252:03 - you got to be paranoid like that like
252:06 - i remember
252:08 - i remember steven friedman and and i
252:10 - have the the notebook actually and i
252:12 - mentioned him before
252:14 - his son is david benioff
252:17 - friedman was a senior dude at at goldman
252:20 - and i wrote down every word he said when
252:22 - he came to guest lecture and i still had
252:23 - the notebook and i read it the other day
252:26 - but what he also said was
252:28 - watch your back
252:29 - because there's always somebody
252:31 - that's smarter faster younger cheaper
252:34 - than you that wants your job
252:36 - uh and it's it's it's kind of
252:39 - that's part of paranoia as well
252:41 - so just be careful like like for me for
252:43 - example
252:44 - i've got multiple audio tracks right now
252:48 - just in case it it messes up like i've
252:50 - got i've got a blue yeti there i've got
252:53 - this sure mic here i've got
252:54 - cheap microphones and all the cameras as
252:56 - well really really cheap ones just in
252:57 - case and so we can synchronize the video
252:59 - as well
253:00 - um
253:01 - just in case one of the things goes down
253:03 - um and
253:05 - whenever i give presentations i always
253:07 - have a second laptop which i used to
253:08 - borrow from a friend now i have my own
253:10 - whatever i'm a nerd i know uh and when i
253:12 - raised to give wedding speeches
253:14 - i would use a laptop and i'd also bring
253:17 - overhead slides just in case
253:20 - always have a backup plan always always
253:22 - always when i used to go to interviews i
253:24 - would over prepare and i would always
253:26 - bring a nutribar and put it in my pocket
253:28 - because a lot of times they forgot to
253:30 - feed you and if you can't if you if
253:31 - you're hungry you can't think and so i
253:33 - would go to the washroom and you know
253:34 - gobble down the the nutribar
253:37 - um but but but i was i was very paranoid
253:39 - and i think it helped me a lot to have a
253:41 - plan b and it made me more confident as
253:43 - well in case something
253:45 - didn't go well
253:46 - i had a backup plan
253:48 - so for intel
253:49 - the backup plan was the processor
253:51 - so you always want to have a plan b
253:54 - always always always yeah only the
253:56 - paranoid survive great book by andy
253:58 - grove read it please
254:00 - all right um next up is
254:03 - hit this key
254:04 - and lose your job
254:09 - we are one little keystroke away from
254:11 - destroying our lives
254:13 - just be careful otherwise what can
254:15 - happen your career is you can quickly be
254:17 - end it
254:18 - just be careful
254:20 - triple check all your emails you are a
254:22 - product a representation of of the
254:25 - digital communication you send out
254:27 - um
254:28 - don't just spell check and grammar check
254:30 - but also
254:31 - think to yourself
254:32 - can this be misinterpreted by anybody
254:36 - and if you're ever emotional or upset
254:38 - just
254:39 - get away from email man
254:41 - or from your your cell phone or whatever
254:43 - it is just be careful your career can be
254:46 - ended quickly and this is a mechanical
254:48 - keyboard here and i love these clicky
254:50 - keyboards by the way i have one like
254:51 - that it's by a german company called
254:53 - dust keyboard yeah
254:55 - all right next up is let the secret out
254:58 - and you're done
254:59 - and that secret is
255:01 - that you want to leave your company and
255:04 - go back to school
255:06 - even if it's for whatever degree
255:09 - don't ever tell anybody
255:11 - don't ever tell anybody
255:12 - that you want to leave
255:14 - unless you want to get a reference
255:15 - letter whatever which you can ask in a
255:17 - more diplomatic way which i can talk
255:19 - about if you want me to
255:21 - but
255:22 - if you tell somebody that you're
255:24 - interested in leaving to go back to
255:25 - school at some point
255:28 - you know they might
255:30 - they might say oh that's great that's
255:32 - awesome i agree it's a good idea
255:35 - but then
255:37 - the next time a recession hits
255:39 - and business is very cyclical
255:42 - and
255:42 - companies tend to over hire when things
255:44 - are going well and they tend to over
255:46 - fire meaning they cut into muscle not
255:48 - just fat when things are not going well
255:50 - but if they have to the way it works in
255:52 - big companies is
255:54 - if companies have to you know cut
255:56 - expenses so they can make their
255:57 - quarterly earnings when they report
255:58 - earnings
255:59 - what will happen is
256:01 - management will tell
256:03 - all the bosses in all the different
256:04 - divisions i need one head each that's
256:06 - how it works it's quantitative
256:09 - and
256:10 - your boss will think themselves well
256:13 - and i'm going to make this up
256:15 - chris is great he's one of my best
256:16 - performers
256:18 - but he told me a while i remember a
256:19 - while ago he told me he wants to go back
256:21 - to school
256:22 - so if he's going to leave anyway i might
256:25 - as well choose him
256:27 - dta don't trust anyone don't tell
256:29 - anybody at all at work that you're ever
256:32 - thinking of of going back to school okay
256:37 - all right next up is oh dude this one
256:39 - was so dope that was boba fett boba fett
256:42 - was the best character ever uh and he
256:44 - was barely in star wars he was in
256:46 - revenge of the the jedi for like a
256:48 - nanosecond
256:50 - and then han solo turned around and he
256:51 - fell down into that big hole he died
256:54 - when hans was
256:55 - hans couldn't see and by the way i've
256:56 - got to go there i'm so sorry i don't
256:58 - care i'm going to do this i'm i'm a star
257:00 - wars fan
257:01 - so
257:03 - do i have my star wars thing there it's
257:04 - right here yeah yeah
257:06 - all right
257:08 - so
257:09 - there's politics in movies as well if
257:11 - you're a real jerk of an actor or
257:13 - actress
257:15 - you won't get rehired and that's what
257:17 - happened apparently hearsay whatever
257:20 - with megan fox remember she's in the
257:21 - transformers and stuff you don't see her
257:23 - anymore because she was
257:24 - she was difficult to anyway on one of
257:27 - those productions you can google it if
257:28 - you want to
257:29 - and a lot of great actors that you don't
257:31 - hear about anymore it's because they
257:32 - were difficult there's politics you know
257:34 - at their job as well like there's
257:35 - politics with us that's why i'm talking
257:37 - about sharks but i have to talk about
257:39 - harrison for it because he's he's he's
257:40 - awesome
257:43 - he was so difficult to deal with
257:46 - in empire strikes back
257:49 - so difficult when they were making it
257:51 - that what they did was
257:54 - they didn't know if they were going to
257:55 - bring him back in to return the jedi
257:58 - and so what they did at the end of the
258:00 - empire strikes back is they froze him
258:03 - remember that he was frozen um anyway
258:07 - and they ended up bringing him back and
258:08 - and
258:09 - that's why we're talking about boba fett
258:10 - when he couldn't see because he was
258:12 - unfrozen for a while and return the jedi
258:14 - he yeah anyway
258:16 - but you gotta admit
258:17 - boba fett's pretty pretty dope pretty
258:19 - badass yeah
258:21 - yeah
258:24 - so
258:25 - i always have a personal backup plan
258:27 - okay
258:28 - and
258:30 - what remind me to do this is because
258:32 - boba fett's dad or something had a
258:35 - gazillion versions of
258:36 - himself made cloned whatever
258:39 - but always have a backup plan in terms
258:41 - of
258:42 - what do you do
258:44 - if your company
258:46 - might let you go
258:49 - um
258:50 - and a lot of times you won't know
258:52 - because what can happen in business is
258:54 - everything is going well and then we go
258:56 - into this horrific recession in a
258:58 - nanosecond
259:00 - or something like um
259:03 - like a black swan event occurs
259:06 - like like a virus or whatever it is or
259:08 - terrorist events or
259:10 - i don't know
259:12 - the 2008 crash whatever it's something
259:14 - you can't control they call it black
259:15 - swan because black swans are rare
259:16 - they're usually not black yeah
259:20 - so
259:21 - the backup plan is this
259:23 - i don't want you to be loyal
259:25 - to any company that's right
259:28 - you're thinking chris that's not ethical
259:32 -  loyalty
259:33 - i'm sorry i swore but i want you to
259:35 - remember this
259:37 - no company is going to be loyal to you
259:38 - and your family
259:40 - okay when when when push comes to shove
259:42 - they have to let people go you got to be
259:44 - loyal to your family first
259:46 - than yourself than the company that's
259:48 - right
259:49 - that's right you got to look out for
259:51 - yourself and if you don't look out for
259:52 - yourself and have a plan b
259:55 - then you're hurting your family
259:57 - or your future family
259:59 - and so if a headhunter calls you that's
260:02 - why that's why i put both that's right
260:04 - he's uh he's a headhunter or something
260:06 - or a bounty hunter bounty hunter that's
260:08 - why i put him
260:10 - but if if a headhunter calls you
260:13 - um saying that they're interested in
260:15 - interviewing you to maybe hire you or
260:17 - whatever
260:18 - take that meeting take every damn
260:20 - meeting
260:22 - and just don't meet with them in a place
260:25 - too close to your work obviously and and
260:27 - by the way if if your company gives you
260:29 - um
260:32 - if they give you a cell phone at work
260:36 - if you have um
260:39 - if you have enough money
260:40 - to do it i want you to get the exact
260:42 - same one
260:43 - for yourself
260:45 - because at work you know you're gonna be
260:46 - using that phone whatever
260:48 - but i also want you to have another
260:49 - phone just in case
260:51 - in case you want to make personal calls
260:53 - or in case and it's a good investment
260:55 - in case uh some other company calls you
260:58 - and you're setting up an interview you
260:59 - don't want
261:00 - you don't want anybody to be able to
261:01 - fish through your emails and personal
261:03 - stuff also
261:05 - if you work for a jerk and you will one
261:07 - day
261:09 - uh i'm not hiring though in case you're
261:11 - thinking i'm a jerk no but if you work
261:13 - for a jerk um
261:15 - and this jerk makes you stay late at
261:16 - work
261:17 - just for facetime whatever and it's
261:19 - bogus
261:21 - i want you
261:23 - on your laptop whatever
261:25 - to use your personal wi-fi network with
261:27 - these things
261:29 - and write a business plan
261:30 - on their nickel that's right if legally
261:33 - you're allowed to start screw that i
261:35 - don't care i'm i'm a pit bull and a pork
261:38 - chop helping you
261:40 - always have that plan b
261:41 - always always always please yeah
261:45 - all right next up is question motives
261:50 - and why do i have an old tv there
261:52 - i i have a tv because um
261:55 - whenever somebody's being interviewed on
261:57 - television
261:59 - i i want you to
262:01 - before accepting what they say is gospel
262:03 - or being true or legitimate or whatever
262:06 - i want you to ask yourself
262:08 - what's their angle
262:10 - why are they saying that
262:12 - what's their bias remember bias always
262:16 - if it's a ceo
262:18 - they're saying great things about the
262:19 - company because
262:20 - they're sales people that's their
262:22 - company they're not being unethical
262:24 - but they're biased
262:26 - of course they're going to say great
262:27 - things always
262:30 - and if somebody's interviewed that's a
262:31 - money manager like maybe they're a
262:33 - portfolio manager at a mutual fund or
262:34 - something
262:37 - of course you're going to talk about the
262:38 - stocks they own even if they disclose it
262:42 - of course they're going to say positive
262:43 - things about it there's a bias they want
262:45 - to get you to bottom to push them higher
262:49 - so always ask yourself
262:51 - why are they doing that
262:53 - you know why you gotta in your in your
262:55 - mind question motives and it's part of
262:58 - game theory which is like chess thinking
263:01 - a couple heads uh moves ahead of what
263:03 - somebody might do
263:05 - it's game theory
263:06 - always question somebody's motives not
263:08 - out loud but just in your mind you know
263:11 - it's not as politics and work and
263:14 - paranoia within within corporate
263:15 - environments is is all about
263:18 - game theory and chess moves you want to
263:20 - understand somebody like what their
263:22 - background is you know what their
263:23 - interests are and just more about them
263:25 - you know that's game theory you're doing
263:27 - your research
263:28 - um
263:29 - you want to think like they're going to
263:31 - think when you meet with them
263:32 - and you can always go to their twitter
263:33 - profile to see who they follow to learn
263:35 - more about them yeah
263:37 - or the bottom of their linkedin profile
263:39 - to see which companies or people they
263:40 - follow and by the way don't ever follow
263:42 - politicians ever ever ever on linkedin
263:45 - or on twitter you know if you're curious
263:47 - what donald trump's going to say on
263:48 - twitter you can go and type up the real
263:50 - donald trump and see for a while but
263:52 - don't follow you know even if you're
263:54 - republican it doesn't matter
263:55 - just
263:56 - yeah be careful
263:58 - all right um
264:00 - that's paranoia i guess
264:02 - all right and that's what the back of
264:04 - tvs used to look like there yeah they
264:05 - weren't dude they were massive back then
264:07 - massive yeah
264:09 - all right uh so now i want you to go to
264:10 - your workbook and click number 13
264:12 - meaning section 13
264:14 - on the front page
264:16 - and then spend three minutes writing
264:17 - down notes
264:18 - on how you can apply the lessons we just
264:20 - talked about here
264:21 - in section 13
264:23 - to enhance your your career you got
264:25 - three minutes go
264:27 - [Music]
265:01 - [Music]
265:57 - [Music]
266:18 - [Music]
266:56 - [Music]
267:16 - [Music]
267:22 - all right section 14 risk taking i love
267:25 - this one i love this one
267:27 - it's crucial you take the right kinds of
267:29 - risks you'll never get ahead in life
267:31 - unless you take risks and plenty of
267:33 - risks and embrace failure embrace
267:36 - failure and fail fast and i'll get to
267:38 - that soon
267:39 - all right so let's talk about risks
267:41 - yeah fail fast and fail
267:44 - early
267:45 - okay um
267:46 - if if you start a company
267:48 - give yourself two years
267:51 - and after two years
267:53 - i want you to ask yourself
267:55 - if i had known
267:57 - about all the issues that i uncovered i
267:59 - discovered over the past two years would
268:01 - i have still have started this company
268:03 - and the answer is no
268:05 - pull the plug
268:06 - move on
268:08 - you're going to start a lot of companies
268:10 - in life and as mark cuban said you only
268:12 - have to be right in business one time
268:16 - every single amazing business person you
268:18 - know of
268:20 - you only know about their successes you
268:22 - don't know about the crappy companies
268:23 - they started and they failed the best
268:25 - you know like uh
268:27 - bill gates and paula allen together
268:30 - they started a company called trafford
268:32 - ida where they had these little wires on
268:34 - roads you know when you go over it
268:37 - and it counts cars they failed
268:39 - yeah so fail fast and fail early and
268:42 - don't give a damn what anybody thinks
268:44 - anyway because you are going to make it
268:46 - huge one day regardless what anybody
268:48 - thinks you give a damn what people think
268:50 - anyway fail fast fail early keep moving
268:53 - forward
268:56 - all right next up is
268:58 - opm not the drug
269:00 - but opm stands for other people's money
269:02 - and that's danny devito
269:04 - great actor funny man
269:06 - um he was in this movie called other
269:08 - people's money which is a great movie
269:10 - you gotta watch it because it will
269:11 - explain to you
269:13 - what is private equity in a fun way it's
269:15 - a great movie and like every hollywood
269:18 - movie the rich person loses at the end
269:21 - or is a schmuck or becomes nice or
269:23 - whatever it is what it is there's no
269:25 - exception every movie because i have to
269:27 - appeal to everybody whatever
269:29 - i should stop now
269:30 - but um i actually learned that from rush
269:32 - limbaugh is that terrible years ago
269:34 - uh the the rich person's always a
269:36 - schmuck a movie but but watch that movie
269:39 - if you can because it'll really explain
269:40 - you what what opm other people's money
269:43 - and how private equity works but the
269:44 - reason i put opm here
269:46 - in devito
269:48 - is because
269:49 - i don't want you to use your own money
269:51 - to start companies
269:53 - if you have a lot of money yes you can
269:56 - but i don't want you to put your family
269:58 - at risk or put too much stress on
269:59 - yourself
270:00 - i want you to raise money from high net
270:02 - worth investors
270:03 - but i want you to raise money from high
270:05 - net worth investors initially
270:07 - okay
270:08 - now the sales cycle is quite shorter
270:10 - than going after venture capital and if
270:12 - you network and find something in common
270:14 - with people and you present with passion
270:16 - right from your heart like i'm going to
270:18 - teach you you will be able to raise
270:20 - money
270:21 - and when you raise money i want you to
270:23 - make sure that you pay yourself the same
270:24 - salary at least that way you make at
270:26 - that previous company
270:28 - you're at
270:29 - because i don't want you to bring your
270:30 - stress home
270:32 - i want you to
270:33 - make sure your family is happy and
270:35 - you're happy as well
270:37 - use other people's money you can do it
270:40 - if if you don't think you can
270:42 - then you won't be able to
270:44 - but you know it as henry ford said
270:47 - whether or not you think you can do it
270:49 - you're right
270:50 - be relentless like a pit bull on a pork
270:51 - chop
270:52 - and it will happen i promise you
270:55 - all right next up is
270:57 - um don't invest if all the founders have
271:00 - left and i put here and you can go if
271:02 - you want just do it do a search um
271:05 - on on me chris
271:08 - haroon venture beats so venture beat is
271:12 - the
271:13 - it's it's like the wall street journal
271:14 - but for
271:16 - uh for uh for venture capital
271:18 - um and then you just you'll find this
271:20 - article i wrote years ago uh and i wrote
271:22 - about this and i really do believe it
271:24 - that um
271:26 - when i found and i was just a guest
271:27 - columnist i love writing like it's fun
271:29 - for me and it's good for your career too
271:31 - and we'll talk about embracing the media
271:32 - really really soon how can help you it's
271:34 - free pr
271:35 - everybody wins they win you win
271:38 - so network a lot to get meetings with
271:40 - the media and i'll talk more about that
271:42 - later on but when um
271:46 - when a founder leaves a company
271:48 - when all the founders leave a company
271:49 - and are no longer engaged at all
271:52 - you gotta run for the exits man
271:55 - you do
271:56 - because most of the time
271:58 - that company won't be as successful in
271:59 - the long run
272:01 - because what happens is founders run a
272:03 - company
272:04 - and the board loves the founder
272:06 - and investors love the founder
272:09 - and the founder doesn't give a damn
272:11 - about anybody except making that company
272:14 - change the world in the long run and so
272:16 - they're given a lot of leeway like jeff
272:18 - bezos or elon musk whatever
272:21 - um i shall let me stick with with jeff
272:22 - bezos on this one so jeff bezos he
272:26 - doesn't even get on the earnings call
272:27 - the quarterly call he doesn't care he's
272:29 - long-term focused he doesn't care if
272:31 - people are saying
272:33 - well you're not going to be making a big
272:34 - profit this quarter so you know i i
272:37 - think we should find another ceo
272:39 - no
272:40 - investors are long-term greedy and
272:42 - focused on bezos that's why they own
272:44 - amazon
272:45 - if he left that company point watch out
272:49 - because what would happen is this like
272:51 - it does with most other companies where
272:52 - the founders all leave and are no longer
272:53 - engaged
272:54 - usually
272:55 - what happens is
272:57 - bureaucracy and politics
273:00 - rule everything because if if you're at
273:03 - a and it happened with with uh with
273:05 - buddies of mine i worked at
273:06 - hewlett-packard
273:07 - you know they were senior executives and
273:11 - they didn't want to take any risks
273:13 - because you know they were getting a
273:14 - nice paycheck and climbed the corporate
273:16 - ladder and if they took a risk
273:17 - and they created a new department or
273:19 - product they they if they messed up
273:22 - they're not going to get promoted
273:23 - they're done
273:24 - and if they are successful with that
273:26 - they're not going to get paid a huge
273:27 - amount anyway
273:29 - so the status quo
273:30 - is
273:31 - keep being a politician collect that
273:33 - paycheck you know grip and grin which i
273:36 - despise
273:37 - climb through the ranks
273:39 - and and be political i hate it
273:41 - but if the vander still there the
273:43 - founder doesn't give a damn about
273:44 - politics the founder is long-term
273:46 - focused remember what warren buffett
273:48 - said the longer the view the wise
273:49 - intention
273:50 - and they're not political at all so be
273:52 - careful be careful about when founders
273:55 - all leave a
273:56 - company all right so please go to your
273:59 - workbook
274:00 - and on the first page as always

277:20 - mean it it looks the way it's supposed
277:22 - to look but what i was trying to do
277:23 - there is this is actually a setting from
277:26 - the first movie blade runner 1982
277:28 - classic
277:29 - um and it's one of those chinese
277:32 - restaurants that harrison ford ate at
277:34 - anyway
277:35 - i had a lot of fun doing this i feel
277:36 - like an artist with this a crappy artist
277:38 - i get it like i'm no uh
277:41 - i'm no picasso and i'll leave picasso
277:43 - here to give me a little bit of uh
277:45 - inspiration and you got to do a search
277:47 - on picasso quotes he's got great quotes
277:49 - so anyway castle's my friend i have more
277:51 - hair than him though okay
277:53 - so um
277:55 - yeah let's talk about these ones here
277:57 - sales best practices number one is less
278:00 - is
278:01 - more
278:02 - always
278:04 - with corporate communications never have
278:06 - more than three sentences ever again in
278:09 - a paragraph
278:11 - less is more keep it short and we'll
278:14 - talk a lot about how to give a great
278:15 - presentation and how to raise money
278:18 - by having fewer bullet points on a slide
278:22 - i'm telling you you don't have to work
278:22 - as hard now three bullet points on a
278:24 - slide because we can't handle more than
278:26 - three things at a time uh on on a slide
278:28 - when you're trying to raise money
278:29 - whatever
278:30 - uh and if you do try to use images or
278:32 - some fun innovative way to do it
278:34 - less
278:35 - is more quite often people will only
278:38 - read the first page of a very very long
278:40 - report anyway
278:41 - less is more
278:43 - and if you have to write a big report
278:45 - then you know try to
278:47 - you know
278:49 - try to have like a summary on the first
278:50 - page or lots of summaries and i even did
278:53 - this um
278:55 - see the berlin wall behind there i even
278:56 - did this with this book like i realized
278:59 - that you know shorter chapters are
279:01 - better like each no chapter i don't
279:03 - think there's maybe one or two that are
279:05 - longer on the page but a lot of them are
279:06 - really really short
279:08 - really really short you know less is
279:10 - more and that's how people consume media
279:12 - these days you know gone are the days
279:14 - when you
279:16 - gone are the days when when you read a 5
279:19 - 000 word editorial article in vanity
279:22 - fair whatever it is or whatever
279:24 - newspaper it is
279:25 - less is more
279:26 - that's why twitter is twitter
279:30 - all right moving on oh yeah i started to
279:33 - use
279:33 - yeah movement here might be a little
279:35 - distracting sorry
279:38 - i want you to present with passion and
279:40 - enjoy public speaking
279:42 - condition yourself to love it and you'll
279:44 - excel at it and most people are
279:46 - terrified of it and i'm going to make
279:47 - you into presentation rockstars very
279:49 - very soon in the smc courses
279:53 - enjoy it embrace it
279:56 - all right next up is
279:59 - shut up and i say with love my heart
280:01 - speaking of the hardest up there i made
280:02 - it smaller but it's still beaten
280:04 - shut up if you think you close the sale
280:08 - don't sell past the close
280:11 - sometimes when you when you get the
280:13 - impression somebody
280:15 - loves a product that you're selling or
280:16 - service
280:18 - don't sell it anymore stop
280:20 - stop right away
280:23 - otherwise they're gonna think this this
280:25 - is what will be going through their mind
280:26 - okay
280:28 - they'll be thinking oh gosh i love this
280:30 - product i love this service gosh chris
280:31 - is doing a great job selling i love it i
280:33 - love it
280:34 - why does he keep selling it am i missing
280:36 - something am i a sucker why am i so
280:38 - lucky to be given this opportunity i
280:40 - don't trust him
280:41 - i don't know oh no i do trust him i
280:43 - don't i just don't know he's overdoing
280:45 - i'm not gonna buy
280:52 - next up is small clients are just as
280:55 - much work as big clients and sometimes a
280:57 - hell of a lot more
280:59 - try to bag the elephant if you can go
281:00 - elephant hunting
281:02 - [Music]
281:03 - that i don't mean that way but just try
281:04 - to get big customers if you know what i
281:06 - mean instead of smaller ones
281:08 - um
281:09 - because
281:10 - small small customers are small
281:12 - customers are more work than big
281:13 - customers sometimes they have
281:16 - more of their net worth with you and
281:17 - that's why
281:19 - um or they spent more money as a
281:21 - percentage of their net worth on on the
281:23 - product or service they bought from you
281:24 - than a bigger customer just be careful
281:27 - um you know i i i value all my customers
281:30 - uh and i love them all sincerely i do
281:33 - but
281:34 - and for me it doesn't matter it's kind
281:35 - of a moot point because all my customers
281:37 - are the same right it's the same pricing
281:39 - point always
281:40 - but when i used to work um and i would
281:43 - get customers
281:45 - the biggest customers were the best
281:47 - because the amount of time and
281:48 - hand-holding i had to do with them was
281:50 - much less because they were more
281:52 - sophisticated sometimes as well yeah be
281:54 - careful be careful
281:57 - all right next up we've got all i heard
282:00 - was not no
282:02 - i want you to sell sell sell sell sell
282:04 - sell sell and keep selling keep selling
282:05 - keep selling keep selling until you
282:07 - sense they're interested then stop
282:08 - talking
282:10 - until then keep selling selling selling
282:12 - selling and tell yourself in your mind
282:13 - all i heard was not no all i heard was
282:15 - not no and don't forget to ask for the
282:17 - sale like a lot of times people go to
282:18 - meetings sales meetings and they'll talk
282:20 - about their product
282:21 - and they'll have a great lunch with
282:23 - somebody whatever and they never ask for
282:25 - the sale you gotta ask
282:27 - but don't get discouraged until you hear
282:30 - the word no
282:31 - and by the way when you hear the word no
282:33 - it basically means not yet
282:35 - all i heard was not no
282:39 - all right
282:42 - next up
282:43 - talk business later
282:47 - bond as much as you can with your
282:48 - clients a big rookie mistake is you show
282:50 - up and you start talking business right
282:52 - away you know business we know it's
282:54 - about relationships first and product
282:56 - knowledge second
282:57 - talk business later okay
283:01 - all right
283:03 - how to get a meeting with anyone so the
283:05 - route of how to get a meeting with
283:07 - anybody
283:08 - is as we know
283:11 - you want to find something in common
283:12 - with them right and the stars kind of
283:14 - got all kind of a line for somebody to
283:16 - take a meeting and and love you and do
283:19 - business with you
283:20 - so you want to
283:21 - appeal that personal
283:24 - personal motive so to speak
283:26 - um find something in common with with
283:28 - somebody you know um and and i talked
283:31 - about how to get
283:32 - informational meetings using linkedin et
283:34 - cetera cover pages by finding something
283:36 - you have in common maybe you're from the
283:37 - same hometown
283:40 - talk about your hometown
283:41 - when you meet with them you know how to
283:43 - conduct that meeting anyway
283:45 - and talk about how your hometown has
283:46 - changed or the schools change whatever
283:48 - it is and what i was going to do
283:50 - actually for for this uh
283:52 - for this um
283:54 - let me go back actually i don't want to
283:55 - look at that baseball one yet now you're
283:57 - all looking at the baseball ones we're
283:58 - there let me go back here yeah so what i
284:00 - was trying to do initially and i
284:02 - couldn't find the right 3d models to do
284:04 - it
284:05 - was i saw this great movie ratatouille
284:09 - and
284:11 - great movie i'm sure you've all seen it
284:13 - it's about a rat
284:15 - that
284:16 - makes good food
284:18 - and there's a critic
284:20 - a really really mean food critic that
284:22 - comes into this dude's restaurant
284:25 - and
284:26 - the rat is nervous and so the rats like
284:30 - what kind of food should i make
284:32 - well i want to appeal this person's
284:34 - background his emotions
284:37 - and so what happened was the rats
284:39 - made ratatouille i guess that's why it's
284:41 - called that
284:42 - uh it's and when the food critic you
284:44 - gotta watch it man there's that one
284:46 - scene where they they pull in and push
284:48 - back at the same time on his face when
284:50 - he takes a bite of the ratatouille and
284:52 - he drops the
284:54 - the the fork in in slow motion
284:58 - and then the the food critic goes back
285:01 - in time and remembers
285:03 - growing up and his mom basically
285:06 - touching his face uh and giving him
285:08 - ratatouille as a child
285:12 - i couldn't find that image so i looked
285:13 - everywhere for it i couldn't find it
285:16 - but you got to check it out
285:17 - you got to appeal to emotions
285:20 - and find something in common with
285:21 - somebody as well it's a different angle
285:22 - different way of thinking but it works
285:24 - exceptionally well
285:26 - you gotta yeah every battle's law
285:28 - enforcement fought as you know
285:30 - um and speaking of ratatouille so the
285:32 - best restaurant in america
285:34 - is called french laundry and it's about
285:37 - a 40 minute drive north of where i live
285:39 - here
285:40 - um it's it's in napa valley i've never
285:43 - eaten there it's too expensive for me
285:44 - it's 500 bucks to eat there not
285:46 - including alcohol
285:47 - and
285:49 - what rats what the folks at pixar did
285:52 - was they actually went
285:54 - to um when they were doing research on
285:56 - the movie
285:57 - all the kitchen scenes for ratatouille
285:59 - were modeled exactly
286:01 - after french laundry uh up in napa
286:04 - valley it's pretty cool it's pretty cool
286:05 - and speaking this is a good little side
286:07 - note here but but speaking of um
286:10 - speaking of pixar
286:12 - in 2008
286:14 - i went to a party here uh for one of my
286:17 - kids
286:18 - they were in the whole birthday party
286:20 - phase between the first grade and fourth
286:21 - grade whatever
286:22 - and i met this guy at a house here in
286:24 - hillsborough
286:25 - and you know a lot of my best contacts
286:28 - actually are through my my kids friends
286:29 - parents it is what it is
286:32 - and this guy at that point in time
286:34 - he worked at pixar
286:37 - and i asked him i said oh dude i'm a big
286:39 - fan
286:40 - what movie are you making next
286:42 - he said well
286:43 - it's this movie about this
286:45 - old man
286:47 - and this
286:49 - short little fat kid
286:52 - and
286:53 - there's a bird named kevin
286:56 - and
286:58 - they throw some balloons on the house
286:59 - the house goes up in the air and they go
287:01 - on a journey
287:03 - and i'll never forget what i said to him
287:04 - i said it very politely i said this
287:07 - i said
287:08 - dude that's a merchandising disaster
287:10 - like you're not going to sell any toys
287:12 - like it's it's like
287:14 - why would you why i mean the incredibles
287:17 - was awesome you can make incredibles
287:19 - part two three four five six whatever
287:20 - you make a gazillion toy stories because
287:22 - you know toy story you got all the toys
287:24 - and my kid loved that that woody or andy
287:26 - doll whatever it was
287:28 - um and buzz lightyear
287:31 - and he said to me he said you know chris
287:35 - we don't make movies we think people are
287:37 - gonna like
287:39 - we make movies from our heart
287:41 - we don't try to do it to make money it's
287:43 - not about money
287:45 - it's about touching somebody's heart
287:48 - by using our own heart
287:51 - and and
287:52 - my goodness was he right
287:54 - because up
287:56 - that movie was the bomb i loved it not a
287:59 - bomb it was awesome i loved it and the
288:01 - soundtrack too by michael cameron's last
288:03 - name but
288:04 - oh my god and there's one scene from
288:06 - that movie too where he goes his wife
288:08 - passes away it's sad
288:11 - but that like
288:13 - three or four minute entire lifespan of
288:15 - that guy's life
288:16 - um when he was young when he met her to
288:18 - the great pen he had remember the great
288:20 - pen he had uh got married they couldn't
288:22 - have kids and she passed away
288:26 - i'm just getting shivers thinking about
288:27 - the music just appealing emotions anyway
288:30 - it was a great movie a little off track
288:31 - there but
288:32 - thinking with your heart is great
288:34 - because if you don't think with this
288:35 - this don't work this ain't gonna work
288:38 - so always try to appeal the emotions uh
288:40 - if if you can i'm gonna put picasso back
288:42 - on the shelf here
288:44 - all right good
288:46 - all right next up is uh confidence uh
288:49 - leads to competence i love baseball i
288:52 - had to throw a baseball in there
288:53 - somewhere
288:54 - um
288:55 - and
288:57 - you'll never like
288:59 - athletes do exceptionally well because
289:01 - they're confident you'll never see an
289:03 - athlete who's
289:04 - who doesn't have confidence
289:06 - especially in baseball where dude like
289:08 - you've got somebody's throwing a ball at
289:11 - you that's 100 miles an hour that's
289:13 - curving it might hit you
289:15 - you got to be confident
289:17 - it's even harder in qriket dude because
289:19 - in cricket that ball can bounce as it's
289:21 - curving and then hit you
289:23 - and and there's a windmill as well it
289:26 - yeah you got to be confident i think
289:28 - therefore i am
289:30 - uh in lebron james
289:32 - before each basketball game he meditates
289:34 - and he thinks of himself shooting shots
289:36 - getting in it over and over and over
289:38 - again that's almost as good as
289:39 - practicing
289:40 - um confidence is a it's an attractive
289:43 - trait
289:45 - um
289:46 - and for those of you that are trying to
289:47 - get a date
289:49 - if you don't come across as co i'm not
289:51 - gonna i suck at dating but you gotta be
289:53 - confident man

290:08 - mean polite but confident too yeah
290:12 - yeah
290:14 - all right
290:16 - so yeah confidence leads to a competence
290:18 - if you believe in yourself um
290:21 - there's there's nothing you can't do
290:23 - and that's why on wall street they love
290:24 - to hire former athletes actually a lot
290:27 - of the time give me one second check
290:31 - yeah all right
290:32 - um they like to hire former athletes
290:35 - because they're confident
290:36 - and a lot of jobs on wall street you're
290:38 - in sales
290:39 - and if you're confident and you're
290:41 - selling not arrogant but if you're
290:42 - confident
290:44 - then confidence leads to perceived
290:45 - competence
290:49 - all right next up is sports is crucial
290:53 - boardroom talk it is it is
290:56 - um and not everybody's a sports fan and
290:58 - you can talk about movies and whatever
291:00 - arts or whatever it is that interests
291:02 - you
291:03 - but
291:05 - talking about sports

293:10 - typical american oh my god people can be
293:11 - pissed off i don't care here we go
293:13 - it's called the world series
293:15 - because

293:19 - even there's only teams in america
293:21 - and they they put a team in toronto as
293:23 - you can see there in 1977 that was the
293:24 - first game
293:26 - and then in 1992 we finally won the
293:28 - world series in toronto and of course i
293:31 - had that i got teased all the time by my
293:33 - american friends who are very witty they
293:35 - teased me about boots being canadian so
293:38 - i teased them i remember that 92 after
293:40 - on the world series i was like ah
293:43 - ah yeah we won the world series yeah
293:46 - who's who's the king now huh
293:48 - and they said to me it was so funny it
293:50 - was good
293:51 - the retart was yeah so what dude
293:54 - your americans beat our americans
293:56 - i was like oh shut the up okay
293:58 - anyway it was funny sports is crucial
294:00 - boardroom talk yeah
294:04 - all right
294:06 - next up is golf often
294:09 - and i know golf can seem expensive
294:11 - it's not if you look around and play at
294:14 - crappy places which is what i do
294:16 - in fact my son dylan um
294:20 - it was personal here
294:22 - so my middle child here dylan it's like
294:24 - a son of me i'll stop using the same
294:26 - jokes over and over again i promise you
294:28 - oh here we go you can kind of see it
294:29 - there yeah okay i should use this one to
294:31 - begin with
294:32 - so uh dylan
294:33 - this guy here in the middle
294:35 - his golf teacher uh is a guy named matt
294:38 - who's uh my videography i i hired him
294:40 - he's a great guy he's a great guy i met
294:42 - matt at crystal springs which is a golf
294:44 - club where it cost you 30 bucks play
294:46 - around it's a great deal it's a great
294:47 - deal
294:48 - um
294:49 - but um and actually i'll talk about the
294:51 - reason why i hired matt only because
294:53 - he's editing this i'm just kidding
294:56 - um so he was um
295:00 - he's really social
295:01 - and you can pick up a conversation with
295:03 - him about anything anything nice guy
295:06 - nice guy
295:07 - um and and he noticed that i was reading
295:09 - a book on
295:10 - youtube and he said to me oh cool you're
295:14 - looking into youtube whatever
295:16 - and then i sized him up in 30 seconds i
295:18 - knew i knew right away but he talked
295:20 - about green screens and all this stuff
295:21 - nice guy though nice guy more important
295:23 - than anything else you know
295:24 - relationships are more important than
295:26 - product uh product knowledge
295:27 - uh but but you got to make sure that um
295:30 - if you can get on the links and golf
295:32 - with people and don't worry if you suck
295:33 - and you're new to it
295:34 - so what so what i don't know like
295:38 - get out there have fun with a couple of
295:40 - buddies
295:41 - you don't have to be me and by the way
295:43 - i've learned a lot about people by
295:44 - golfing with them if somebody cheats in
295:46 - golf i'm convinced they're going to
295:47 - cheat in business i've seen it i've seen
295:49 - it yeah
295:50 - yeah
295:52 - golf off and uh if you can if you can
295:54 - yeah
295:55 - all right uh and it's always like i've
295:57 - actually i've gotten some of my biggest
295:59 - investors on the golf course
296:01 - by accident
296:02 - like they ended up playing with us on an
296:05 - average course whatever
296:07 - they're like hey do you mind if we
296:08 - there's two of you there's two of us can
296:09 - we play with you and i met people that
296:11 - way
296:12 - and they become my biggest investors
296:14 - yeah it's amazing um yeah anyway
296:17 - next up is
296:19 - number 16 which is dress for success
296:23 - it's so true
296:24 - um
296:26 - you got to play the part
296:27 - like a lot of times before you get
296:28 - promoted you have to kind of dress um
296:31 - like
296:33 - somebody one level above you very subtly
296:35 - don't overdo it
296:37 - um but you have to dress for success
296:40 - and people will judge a book by its
296:41 - cover
296:43 - so
296:44 - you know like in silicon valley it's a
296:45 - little bit different here you can just
296:47 - kind of be laid back and whatever wear
296:50 - crappy clothes and people wouldn't be
296:52 - wearing what i'm wearing
296:53 - but i think it's important it's
296:55 - important how you carry yourself
296:57 - especially because you're not going to
296:58 - get too much exposure to senior
297:00 - executives right away
297:02 - dress for success
297:04 - all right
297:06 - next up is leverage the media oh yeah
297:08 - this is where i was going to come back
297:09 - to it
297:10 - so
297:11 - mark benioff who uh
297:14 - he's the founder of the largest company
297:16 - here in san francisco called
297:17 - salesforce.com and a wonderful
297:19 - humanitarian
297:20 - a good guy
297:22 - i read his book called above the clouds
297:24 - where he had a bunch of tips on how to
297:26 - make it
297:28 - and one of them was
297:29 - leverage the media
297:31 - and i first met mark i think a couple
297:33 - years before salesforce went public in
297:35 - o4
297:36 - and
297:38 - i i remember he was at all the goldman
297:40 - sachs conferences when i worked at
297:41 - goldman and then later on when i was a
297:42 - client of goldman in the hedge fund
297:44 - industry
297:45 - and he was always on panels saying
297:46 - software is dead software is dead cloud
297:49 - is the future the cloud's the future and
297:51 - we're all like i don't understand but he
297:53 - sounds passionate so cool i like it
297:55 - and he was selling something you can't
297:57 - see feeler touch something virtual
297:59 - something boring cloud computing but he
298:01 - made it exciting
298:02 - but he was being controversial it was
298:04 - brilliant
298:06 - by saying that software is dead
298:08 - and
298:09 - i ended up working in his building same
298:11 - building
298:12 - one market plaza here in san francisco
298:14 - and actually i'd see him sometimes
298:16 - walking his dog and bare feet his
298:18 - beautiful labrador in bare feet on on
298:20 - the main floor the lobby the public
298:22 - lobby he didn't give a damn that's why
298:24 - he's successful he doesn't care
298:26 - and i remember once i went out to dinner
298:27 - with him and i sat beside him before the
298:29 - ipo
298:30 - and we were up in the bank of america
298:32 - tower on like the 50th floor uh and
298:35 - i'll never forget he wore hawaiian shirt
298:38 - he was just himself it's just mark it
298:40 - was cool man mark with a c
298:42 - and
298:43 - it was a a a fee pricks or
298:46 - fixed menu or whatever it is
298:48 - and what happened was every time they
298:51 - brought some food over he didn't want
298:53 - he very nicely gently took his knife and
298:56 - fork and put into a big x
298:59 - but he was just himself but he leverages
299:01 - the media big time and the way he
299:03 - leverages the media is
299:05 - he's controversial and controversy sells
299:08 - and you got a network and i taught you
299:10 - how all how to network uh using your
299:12 - backgrounds and all good stuff linkedin
299:14 - find journalists and meet with them okay
299:18 - and and
299:19 - be a little bit controversial as well
299:21 - like for me if i were to do it
299:23 - and i'm probably not going to
299:25 - but if i did i would say
299:27 - two-thirds of harvard business school
299:30 - hbs two-thirds of hbs is bs
299:33 - and if i went on talk shows and did that
299:35 - i get some air time then they'd say what
299:37 - about harun business school i said it's
299:38 - a different age okay leave me alone
299:40 - but i could do something like that or
299:43 - like if you look at um
299:46 - richard branson
299:48 - when he launched virgin cola one of his
299:50 - many virgin companies and he declared a
299:53 - war on coca-cola and pepsi
299:54 - he rented a tank in the early 80s
299:57 - and drove through times square with
300:00 - virgin cola cans all over it of course
300:02 - you couldn't do that today
300:03 - but he was controversial controversy
300:05 - works
300:06 - leverage the media as much as you can
300:10 - because it's free advertising as well if
300:11 - you do it right
300:13 - all right next up is
300:16 - please go to your workbook and click on
300:17 - number 15.
300:19 - the cover page meaning section 15.
300:22 - then please take a boot three minutes

300:27 - the lessons

303:37 - much fun putting this together uh and i
303:39 - wrote the top there crucial
303:41 - highly profitable differentiation
303:43 - strategies
303:44 - uh and so
303:46 - what you see here really shapes my
303:48 - character
303:50 - this changed my life
303:52 - this computer here and i never threw it
303:54 - out
303:55 - um and so let me let me grab it hold on
303:56 - a second
303:59 - whoops
304:04 - this here is from an old um
304:07 - this is a before that mac came out this
304:09 - is from apple ii which we had as a kid
304:12 - and um
304:14 - i just pulled this out for the first
304:15 - time in
304:16 - decades and on it here i don't know if
304:19 - you guys can see it i'll read it you
304:20 - probably can't read that uh but it says
304:23 - um
304:24 - getting older i gotta look like this
304:26 - galaxian
304:28 - um ms pac-man
304:30 - hero and mario brothers and championship
304:34 - load runner
304:35 - yeah
304:36 - oh and i took a hole puncher i remember
304:38 - this i took a hole puncher here
304:40 - so that you couldn't erase it i guess on
304:42 - both sides or whatever it is this is in
304:44 - the days when you take the disc out and
304:46 - flip it but this here is from an apple
304:48 - ii
304:49 - um
304:50 - and let me just put this down here
304:54 - this thing changed my life okay
304:58 - and and i remember when um
305:01 - steve jobs decided not to
305:03 - ship these things with disk drives
305:05 - anymore and people thought he was crazy
305:06 - he was thinking different he was
305:07 - brilliant because of it
305:09 - um i guess i can get a pin to take that
305:11 - out there but whatever
305:13 - um yeah this is ms-dos years ago but i
305:16 - remember i was um i was younger and
305:19 - they wanted to fail me in the sixth
305:20 - grade in the eighth grade and it was
305:22 - because
305:23 - well they thought i had a learning
305:24 - disability but them sorry
305:26 - i have this gripe with teachers like my
305:29 - school i went to when i was younger
305:31 - it's a
305:32 - well-known school whatever and they've
305:34 - asked me to come back and give guest
305:35 - lectures and keynotes or whatever it is
305:38 - never i'll never mention them either i
305:40 - think that a teacher should
305:42 - not have an us versus that mentality and
305:44 - look to look down upon students but
305:46 - treat the student as a customer
305:48 - uh and build their confidence
305:50 - right that's
305:52 - confidence is the most important thing
305:53 - in business
305:55 - one of the most important things
305:56 - you know with confidence you you can
305:58 - achieve anything last thing you need is
306:00 - is a a bastard teacher trying to
306:03 - bring you down
306:05 - or a teacher that's just teaching so
306:08 - that what they can do is they can do
306:10 - research in university that's why i love
306:12 - them teach um but anyway sorry there's a
306:14 - lot of beautiful wonderful teachers in
306:15 - the world okay most of them are sorry
306:17 - about that off topic
306:18 - but but they want to feel me and so i
306:21 - went to this
306:22 - it was a testing center uh in uh
306:25 - oakville so my dad says oakville
306:28 - ontario oakville
306:29 - uh on lake shore road called chisholm
306:32 - uh and they tested me there um whatever
306:35 - i think they were wrong i think they
306:36 - were but my dad bought me this and the
306:39 - second he bought me this
306:41 - everything took off for me i loved it i
306:44 - had fun with it you can tell i like i
306:45 - enjoy this stuff like i light up like a
306:47 - christmas tree like tweety bird like i
306:48 - enjoy this stuff
306:50 - i love using technology and that was my
306:52 - passion one of my passions i guess
306:54 - but this changed my life this this box
306:57 - here and the original ones if you open
306:59 - it this is not an original one but if
307:00 - you open it steve jobs and his whole
307:02 - team signed everything and this is ice
307:04 - put my mouse here i had a velcro on the
307:06 - side and i still do that actually under
307:08 - the table with other stuff yeah
307:10 - um
307:11 - you can see all the all the baseball
307:12 - stuff and everything yeah so anyway
307:15 - this thing here changed my life and so
307:18 - it it's fitting that we now talk about
307:20 - think different you know what i'll do is
307:22 - i'll i'll leave this dude up here with
307:23 - me
307:24 - actually i'll put it back here because
307:26 - that camera won't work
307:28 - all right so so think different is the
307:29 - title of this one here and i want the
307:32 - galera to get in your face there
307:34 - good okay
307:36 - think different
307:39 - and i used a product code called adobe
307:41 - dimension to make all this stuff if
307:43 - you're curious it's easy to use i can
307:45 - show you if you care
307:46 - all right so think different
307:50 - so lesson number 90 we're almost done
307:52 - is be a contrarian and watch your net
307:56 - worth soar
307:58 - um if you buy the same stock everybody
307:59 - else buys you'll
308:01 - i've said it before but
308:03 - you won't make money in the long run
308:04 - because who's the incremental investor
308:05 - to push it higher you've got to be
308:06 - contrarian
308:08 - and just be aware of bubbles they they
308:10 - occur
308:11 - yeah and hundreds of years ago in europe
308:13 - there was a tulip tulip bubble uh and
308:16 - everybody chased the momentum and kept
308:18 - buying these tulip bulbs which kept
308:20 - going up in price an insane amount
308:22 - um and if you weren't a contrarian you
308:24 - you lost your shirt and human nature
308:26 - repeats itself office all right next up
308:28 - is
308:28 - big companies cannot innovate
308:32 - and i'll always bet on two girls or two
308:35 - guys in a garage to change the world
308:37 - uh instead of a big company always
308:40 - always
308:42 - small groups of people can always change
308:44 - the world
308:45 - always always always i think it's
308:47 - competitive advantage and
308:49 - jeff bezos the way he runs amazon
308:51 - is he won't let any meeting take place
308:53 - uh if
308:55 - more than two pizzas are required to
308:57 - feed the room that's why amazon's still
308:59 - very successful they're big but they
309:01 - kind of run like a startup
309:03 - big companies cannot innovate remember
309:06 - that to the same extent uh especially i
309:09 - should say if a founder leaves i should
309:10 - correct that yeah if a founder leaves
309:12 - especially because after steve jobs left
309:14 - apple as much as i love apple
309:16 - what have they done
309:18 - you know they they
309:20 - made a watch which
309:21 - is doing okay they don't publish number
309:24 - of watches they sell because they're
309:25 - probably not selling as many as they
309:26 - thought they should have i don't know
309:28 - i still don't know what the killer app
309:29 - is for this thing i've i've got it or i
309:31 - put it aside here actually it's over
309:33 - here
309:34 - um i wear it and i met johnny ive um at
309:37 - um
309:37 - san francisco moma dinner events we were
309:40 - honoring him
309:41 - um and right when before this thing came
309:43 - out and i said to johnny i talked to him
309:45 - uh and he's the the guy he used to the
309:48 - british dude with a short hair
309:50 - with with a british accent he speaks
309:52 - good and all of us nice guy very serious
309:53 - though
309:54 - i asked him i said what's the killer app
309:56 - for this
309:57 - and he said
309:59 - we don't know yet but perhaps the haptic
310:02 - feedback which by the way is just
310:04 - vibration that's what it means but he
310:06 - sounded really smart by saying haptic
310:08 - feedback he said perhaps that haptic
310:10 - feedback will be a way for
310:13 - families and i enjoy it i have the
310:15 - product but
310:16 - he said it's a way for say a husband and
310:18 - wife they're in bed together
310:20 - and not that but there's a newborn baby
310:23 - in the middle sleeping with them
310:26 - and um
310:28 - the husband
310:30 - gets up or the wife whatever to go to
310:31 - work and if the alarm goes off it wakes
310:34 - up the baby is disaster so
310:36 - this is another way to wake you up
310:38 - whatever because it vibrates on your
310:40 - wrist but he didn't know what the killer
310:41 - wrap was at at the time but but since
310:44 - steve jobs god bless him has moved on
310:46 - they haven't really done that thing
310:47 - anything too radically different like
310:49 - they made a bigger ipad
310:51 - a thinner ipad a bigger iphone a cheaper
310:54 - iphone
310:55 - um
310:56 - yeah so anyway i don't think that big
310:59 - companies can innovate as much uh if the
311:01 - founder has left so don't
311:03 - don't ever feel
311:06 - intimidated by a big company
311:09 - because don't forget that
311:12 - apple was
311:13 - basically steve wozniak and steve jobs
311:16 - in a garage
311:18 - taking on ibm successfully yeah
311:22 - yeah
311:23 - so there it is there it is the computer
311:26 - changed my life yeah
311:28 - yeah
311:29 - all rights
311:32 - i'm going to show you this commercial to
311:33 - you now
311:34 - this commercial you're about to see
311:37 - was only shown one time in history

311:42 - in 1984
311:43 - during the super bowl
311:45 - and 1984 is

312:17 - it was brilliant it was brilliant and as

317:19 - so throw away the bow lines
317:21 - sail away from safe harbor
317:24 - catch the trade winds in your sail
317:26 - explore
317:28 - dream
317:29 - discover
317:31 - brilliant
317:32 - brilliant
317:35 - all right
317:37 - so form your own opinions please
317:41 - all right number 93 is take that walk i
317:45 - was inspired by gandhi with the salt
317:47 - march uh and i actually tried to um i
317:50 - tried my best to find one with a lot of
317:51 - people following it cost a fortune like
317:53 - i got a lot of these for free they're
317:55 - royalty free but
317:56 - there was one that cost a hundred
317:57 - dollars that was tempted so i didn't
317:59 - pull the trigger but but great man great
318:01 - man but
318:05 - so steve jobs
318:07 - used to
318:08 - go on these long walks every day at one
318:09 - o'clock
318:11 - and i do it as well and i put it on my
318:13 - schedule a lot of times
318:15 - take that walk
318:16 - and when you go for a walk it helps you
318:18 - to think differently
318:20 - it helps you to release serotonin it's
318:22 - it's like when you exercise when you
318:24 - feel like crap
318:25 - and then you do a little bit of weights
318:26 - whatever or exercise
318:28 - it releases serotonin in your brain
318:30 - makes you happier
318:32 - and
318:32 - this thing rewards this thing
318:35 - and a lot of my best ideas yeah i think
318:37 - about when i'm walking you know i've
318:38 - written entire courses
318:40 - on long walks i used to take 12 to 14
318:43 - hour walks
318:44 - by myself uh it just it was
318:47 - life-changing and it's fun too you can
318:49 - bring some tunes if you want classical
318:50 - music whatever
318:52 - um
318:53 - and then just go to a starbucks or tim
318:55 - hortons or coffee shop like that
318:57 - whatever it is
318:59 - and just just collect your thoughts yeah
319:02 - it'll allow you to kind of get outside
319:04 - your own body and see the forest from
319:06 - the trees and where you are in life and
319:07 - where you want to be
319:09 - yeah
319:10 - all right next up we've got passion for
319:13 - platforms that's a road
319:15 - obviously
319:17 - so the best type of business models you
319:19 - can create are ones where you
319:22 - you own the road
319:24 - and
319:25 - cars go on the road and you can charge
319:27 - the cars or the toll booths kind of like
319:29 - facebook is a platform for social media
319:31 - i don't trust them
319:33 - it's amazing facebook actually doesn't
319:34 - publish anything
319:36 - but they make money by publishing other
319:38 - people's stuff because it's a platform
319:40 - they're a tool keeper
319:41 - airbnb
319:43 - who'd have thought that the most
319:44 - important hotel company in the world
319:46 - wouldn't own a single hotel
319:48 - their platform
319:51 - same thing with uber who would have
319:52 - thought
319:53 - that the biggest taxi company in the
319:54 - world now uber doesn't own a single taxi
319:58 - they own the platform
320:00 - that's how i want you to think about
320:02 - business models
320:03 - because once you own the road
320:05 - then you can charge the car so to speak
320:07 - and you get other people to be
320:08 - incentivized to populate your platform
320:11 - it's brilliant the ebay has done it
320:13 - microsoft did with windows ios google
320:17 - it's amazing it's incredible
320:23 - all right next up we have don't respect
320:25 - tradition respect innovation i was
320:27 - trying to be innovative here as much as
320:29 - i could
320:30 - um
320:33 - everything is going to be disrupted and
320:35 - product cycles are getting shorter and
320:36 - shorter and shorter now and disruption
320:37 - is happening faster faster faster
320:40 - but just don't don't respect tradition
320:43 - i'm not saying you'd be a jerk whatever
320:44 - but just
320:46 - always question everything every product
320:48 - can be disrupted
320:50 - you know microsoft windows used to be
320:52 - the most dominant operating system
320:54 - platform on every device basically
320:57 - and then windows ce never worked like
320:59 - microsoft really should own
321:01 - the uh you know
321:04 - the smaller form factor operating system
321:06 - market they don't they don't don't
321:09 - respect tradition respect innovation
321:11 - always always always yeah
321:13 - i had a lot of fun making that slide
321:15 - all right so please go to your workbook
321:17 - and click on 16
321:19 - on the cover page number 16.

324:35 - are we looking at there number 17
324:38 - you be you we save the best for last
324:39 - here
324:40 - okay
324:42 - so
324:44 - i want you to be honest and speak from
324:46 - the heart always
324:48 - just be yourself
324:51 - you know people might not remember what
324:52 - you said but never forget the way you
324:54 - made them feel that's a great quote from
324:56 - maya angelou but just be you man just be
324:58 - you
324:59 - don't be a robot don't be data from star
325:01 - trek you know be kirk
325:04 - just your ursula just be yourself and
325:07 - and when you're up there on stage if you
325:09 - mess up whatever
325:11 - you ever see somebody on stage they kind
325:12 - of mess up a bit and you start liking
325:14 - them a lot more
325:15 - because they're a real
325:16 - person you kind of like that just be
325:19 - yourself don't give a damn what anyone
325:21 - thinks
325:23 - you got this far in life
325:25 - and your family and friends love you
325:27 - for being you
325:28 - so why try to be somebody else
325:31 - you know when you were younger in school
325:32 - you were yourself everyone loved you
325:34 - then you start working
325:36 - you get older and you're in the
325:37 - workforce whatever
325:38 - and you're not being yourself
325:41 - why what's the point
325:44 - do you know that when a senior executive
325:46 - walks by you in a big company and if you
325:48 - if you suck up to them
325:51 - or if you're not yourself
325:53 - do you know that they don't respect you
325:55 - more for that they lose respect for you
325:57 - and even worse your colleagues hate you
325:59 - for it
326:01 - just be yourself
326:03 - it's too hard to try to be somebody else
326:05 - anyway
326:07 - and as dr sue said the great thing about
326:09 - having kids is when you read them books
326:11 - at night sometimes i feel like the
326:13 - author of the book is
326:14 - is
326:15 - talking in two languages one to me and
326:17 - one of my kids
326:19 - you know it's like the simpsons it's so
326:21 - brilliantly written the simpsons when i
326:23 - used to watch it my parents were around
326:24 - my parents would laugh every now and
326:25 - then when they were half paying
326:27 - attention because it was written at a
326:29 - different level like they would quote
326:30 - old movies and stuff whatever
326:32 - but dr seuss
326:34 - he said
326:36 - those who mind don't matter
326:38 - and those who matter
326:40 - don't mind
326:42 - just be yourself
326:44 - everybody else is taken
326:47 - all right next up is listen to your
326:50 - spouse
326:51 - they love you
326:52 - they fell in love with a certain person
326:55 - that was themselves and that person
326:57 - might have changed a bit
326:58 - go back to being you
327:00 - listen to your spouse
327:02 - they will help you
327:03 - they'll help you a lot

327:09 - you're not sure if you should
327:11 - pull the trigger on so to speak
327:12 - career-wise
327:14 - you know sometimes you'll look to get
327:16 - advice from lots of people and you
327:17 - forget
327:18 - that your life partner the one you can
327:20 - trust most in life
327:22 - is right beside you remember why you got
327:24 - married in the first place
327:26 - you know only my wife can tell me
327:29 - that i'm wearing a shirt that went out
327:30 - of style eight million years ago i
327:32 - thought plaid was still in in style it's
327:34 - not apparently
327:35 - or if i've dyed my hair too dark i'm
327:38 - getting better now it used to be a
327:39 - little bit too dark at times

328:03 - don't give a damn what they think about
328:04 - you
328:06 - because
328:07 - as you become more successful they're
328:09 - gonna backstab you anyway and remember
328:11 - unjustified criticism is nothing more
328:14 - than a disguised compliment

328:20 - those who mine don't matter and those
328:21 - who matter don't mind i had to say that
328:22 - one again
328:23 - don't let anyone rent space in your head

330:50 - love it
330:51 - but i wrote here you're you're never too
330:53 - old to start over you're never too old
330:55 - to start over
330:57 - you're not you're not
330:59 - um
331:00 - colonel sanders
331:02 - he actually used to live in my hometown
331:03 - of mississauga which is just outside
331:06 - toronto which has a bigger population
331:08 - mississauga than san francisco but most
331:09 - people don't know it
331:12 - but colonel sanders
331:14 - he started uh kfc and it's interesting
331:17 - it was actually for marketing reasons
331:19 - they rebranded kentucky fried chicken to
331:22 - kfc to de-emphasize the the letter f
331:25 - for fry
331:27 - but when um
331:28 - colonel sanders he failed a lot in
331:30 - business his entire life then he was 65.
331:34 - way before i was born he was 65 and he
331:37 - started kfc
331:38 - and he made it huge he did really really
331:40 - well
331:41 - so you're never too old
331:43 - to start over and people today are
331:45 - living 26 years longer
331:47 - than they did back in the 1950s
331:50 - so if you're 65
331:52 - you're not
331:54 - you're 39
331:59 - and you're never too young to change the
332:01 - world as well
332:03 - look at the beetles i've actually got
332:04 - them can you see it up there yeah at the
332:06 - top there awesome the beatles up there
332:08 - that's abby road and by the way oh this
332:10 - is awesome
332:11 - the reason why um
332:14 - the reason why they did that album cover
332:16 - and it was so innovative at the time
332:18 - because it was the first album cover
332:20 - without the name of the band
332:22 - but they were the most four recognizable
332:23 - people on the planet
332:25 - but i gotta i gotta go off script and
332:27 - get this but they were gonna go to mount
332:29 - everest because this was gonna be the
332:31 - triumph their last big album
332:33 - uh ended up not being their last album
332:35 - and then what happened was they uh
332:37 - i don't know life got in the way and
332:40 - john was spending time with yoko and
332:41 - paul is spending time with linda and
332:43 - whatever
332:44 - and they're like screw it i don't want
332:46 - to go to everest that's a lot of work
332:47 - man
332:48 - so the name of the studio they were
332:50 - recording was called abbey roads
332:52 - and they walked right outside abbey road
332:53 - and they're like
332:54 - screw it let's do it let's just take a
332:56 - picture here let me get i want to show
332:58 - it to you
332:59 - so the beatles and i have to talk about
333:01 - this because you know the beatles
333:03 - but they did all their brilliance in
333:05 - their 20s in their 20s
333:08 - unbelievable
333:09 - so if you think you're too young
333:12 - to um change the world
333:15 - these guys did it in their 20s in their
333:18 - 20s it's unbelievable
333:21 - and by the way if you're old older like
333:23 - me
333:25 - and you're you
333:26 - you always wanted to start a rock band
333:28 - outfit do it now you'll be the first 80
333:30 - year old rock star someone's got to do
333:32 - it we're living longer anyway so you're
333:34 - not 80 or 17
333:36 - 54. yeah
333:37 - all right
333:38 - so um
333:40 - i want to go through this here quickly i
333:42 - want to show this to you all right so
333:43 - abby road it's because it's cool and
333:45 - we're going to study this in marketing
333:46 - but i have to do it now i just have to
333:48 - i'll show it to you here actually
333:50 - what you've got here is they went
333:51 - outside and they took a picture
333:53 - and they learned that controversy sells
333:55 - in marketing okay so what they did was
333:57 - this
333:58 - there was a rumor that paul mccartney
334:00 - was dead there was a rumor he was dead
334:02 - um in fact if you listen to the end of
334:05 - strawberry fields and you play it
334:06 - backwards
334:07 - it says uh i buried paul
334:10 - um although john lennon said it actually
334:12 - says cranberry sauce it says i bury paul
334:14 - they're messing around with the media it
334:16 - and there's a rumor and then what
334:18 - happened was that rumor spread for a
334:20 - long long time
334:21 - and here in sgt pepper's there's a patch
334:24 - on paul's
334:27 - shoulder here you see this
334:30 - i got to make sure this the light's not
334:31 - there okay good hold on right there and
334:34 - people thought that said opd
334:36 - but it actually like officially
334:38 - pronounced dead opd that's actually opp
334:40 - yeah you know me opp is ontario uh
334:43 - provincial police opp because i used to
334:45 - live in the province of ontario we call
334:47 - them ontario party poopers
334:49 - and then um right here i think this is
334:52 - the best one to show here
334:54 - let me get it right because this is
334:56 - fascinating check this out this is cool
334:57 - being controversial helps you sell like
334:59 - mark benioff damn it okay here we go
335:02 - so
335:03 - you can see here this is a funeral
335:05 - procession
335:06 - uh and so john lennon is in white there
335:08 - okay and he's the priest
335:10 - then you've got uh ringo starr
335:13 - the drummer
335:14 - he's he's uh he's wearing uh he's the
335:16 - pallbearer the guy that carries the
335:18 - coffin
335:19 - then in the back you got the gravedigger
335:20 - which is george harrison
335:22 - um and then you've got paul mccartney
335:24 - who's in bare feet um smoking see the
335:27 - cigarette there in his hand signal uh
335:29 - signifying death because they even knew
335:30 - back in the 60s hey man smoking's bad
335:33 - and if you look closely
335:35 - this here is a volkswagen beetle it's a
335:38 - reverse here right right here beetle
335:39 - it's clever
335:40 - and the license plate if you zoom in
335:42 - it's probably hard to see here
335:44 - but it says
335:45 - 28 if
335:47 - meaning if paul mccartney were alive
335:49 - he'd be 28. they were playing around but
335:51 - controversy cells maybe have to hold up
335:53 - here and matt you can zoom in if you
335:54 - want there we go yeah
335:57 - yeah anyway so that's pretty cool and
335:59 - even on the back people thought this guy
336:00 - was a a skeleton or something whatever
336:03 - it's pretty cool
336:04 - pretty cool so um
336:06 - it was neat it was neat yeah
336:08 - yeah so
336:10 - and initially with this album they
336:11 - wanted to put which is oh my gosh it's
336:14 - genius
336:15 - they want to put it in a paper bag
336:17 - george mart the producer did and because
336:20 - they uh they thought they were gonna get
336:22 - sued by people here bob dylan everyone
336:24 - but whatever
336:25 - a little bit off topic there but
336:26 - interesting nonetheless
336:28 - we gotta pull this over here cuz we're
336:29 - gonna talk about this in a minute
336:31 - all right we're still recording great
336:34 - yeah so you're never too old uh to start
336:36 - over again
336:37 - right just remember that that uh john
336:39 - lennon song starting over
336:41 - um
336:42 - and i actually met annie levitz who took
336:45 - the the picture of john lennon actually
336:47 - uh on and i got to show you really
336:48 - quickly because i met her she's the best
336:49 - photographer of the last century she's
336:51 - amazing and she was at a benefit just
336:54 - around the corner here um that i went to
336:56 - and i got to meet with her and she she's
336:57 - amazing
336:58 - but let me show you actually so annie
337:00 - levitz and there's a reason i'm showing
337:02 - this okay annie leaves
337:05 - i asked her also like i do with
337:06 - everybody why are you successful
337:08 - and she had some unbelievable things to
337:10 - say
337:11 - uh but you've seen a lot of her her
337:13 - pictures right so um
337:16 - yeah leonardo dicaprio you've seen the
337:18 - cover of vanity fair demi moore and all
337:20 - that stuff there she is there she's
337:21 - wonderful
337:23 - star wars she's the last oh right before
337:25 - my goodness before she passed away
337:26 - that's right just amazing pictures
337:29 - but i asked her why are you successful
337:32 - and she said because
337:34 - her um my favorite actress in history
337:36 - here
337:36 - she said because
337:38 - when i was younger
337:40 - my father was in the army and we moved
337:42 - around all over the world and all over
337:43 - america and so i spent my youth
337:46 - in the back of a a station wagon
337:49 - a car
337:50 - and i kept i saw america through a
337:53 - different vantage point
337:55 - because i was looking outside the window
337:57 - and that window was a metaphor for a
337:59 - frame for a picture right is that right
338:02 - like that yeah yeah a frame
338:04 - and so she thought saw things
338:05 - differently
338:07 - and let me show you um i'll show you the
338:09 - john lennon picture she she took
338:10 - actually uh on the day he died and she
338:13 - my god this is brutal but the day that
338:16 - john lennon was shot
338:17 - um
338:20 - she did a photo shoot okay
338:22 - and she was working for rolling stone at
338:24 - the time
338:25 - uh and and she took um
338:28 - like this picture here right is is was
338:30 - one that's yokono and john lennon
338:32 - obviously
338:33 - it initially
338:35 - um
338:36 - i'll just show you these ones here so
338:38 - initially yoko wasn't supposed to be in
338:40 - the photo shoot
338:41 - and john said no
338:43 - she has to be and i only agree to do
338:45 - this photo shoot if you put yoko on the
338:47 - cover of the of the rolling stone
338:49 - magazine with me

339:07 - took away john len's life with with a
339:09 - gun at the dakota on the upper west side
339:12 - in 1980 i think

339:18 - i'll show you that picture there sorry
339:20 - i'm going to scroll down

339:32 - course they wanted to put uh john lennon
339:34 - on the cover
339:35 - with something on the lines of
339:37 - the the day the music died or something
339:40 - um and um
339:41 - just john lennon and he said absolutely
339:43 - not yoko's got to be there as well i i
339:45 - promised promised john lennon yeah but
339:47 - she showed a couple more pictures how

Cleaned transcript:

the book version of this entrepreneurship course was voted as the number one most popular business book of the year by business insider readers chris herron created this course along with the book that it's based off of chris is a bestselling course creator author business school professor and mba graduate from columbia university business schools do a pretty good job of providing students with theoretical frameworks which can sometimes be applied to real world problems however quite often they overlook the most crucial and practical business lessons like how to network how to find customers or how to get a job if you want to learn how to get a meeting with almost anyone or take your career to the next level then this course is for you i've worked at goldman sachs i've met with top business people including bill gates warren buffett and the founders of the biggest technology companies and at the end of all my meetings with these visionaries i've always asked them for advice on what made them so successful and a lot of what they taught me is not taught in business school so i put together a list of every lesson and i've included it in this book and in this course these lessons will help you take your career to the next level it's exciting to reinvent yourself in ways that you never thought were possible until you realize it is possible anything is possible as many of my students that have taken this course i've realized i put all of my business knowledge and passion into this course and i'm humbled to say that business insider wrote an article stating that my book 101 crucial lessons they don't teach you in business school was voted as the number one business book of the year also forbes magazine stated that this book is one of six books that every entrepreneur needs to read right now so let me teach you about these crucial business lessons let's step out of business school and into the real world as we take your career to the next level in november of 2015 uh one of my clients when i worked fulltime in venture capital had an extra ticket to go to the tony robbins uh event called upw meaning unleash the power within uh down in los angeles uh and so i i i graciously accepted and i went down and in la i think it was at the staples center or a very large convention center there's ten thousand people in the audience it was crazy it was awesome and it was a fourday event and we went through a lot of exercises goal setting workshops etc and then including walking across hot fire coals on the saturday night and tony conditioned us tony robbins and i actually ended up meeting him another time for business really reasons really nice guy but and when i shook his hand his hand like wrapped around my hand he's a big dude big dude but a really nice guy as well but what he did was on the saturday night of that fourday event back in 2015 he had us walk across boiling hot coals like it looked like lava and he conditioned us to believe in our mind that we're not going to feel any pain at all he conditioned us to do that and so i walked across the coals and i didn't feel any pain at all it was exhilarating and of course i had lots of fire hoses there just in case whatever i didn't feel any pain it was amazing uh and and i went back to my hotel it was actually an airbnb that night uh in in la and i um i i couldn't sleep because i was excited but also because there's blisters in my feet and i had to take a bunch of advil my feet were fine though but that that event kind of changed me it really changed me and on the sunday of that four day event uh what tony robbins did was he said that write down your goals and he then said i want you to think of one particular goal that you've been kind of putting off for a while in your life and what i want you to do is i want you to write down that goal and i also want you to write down a deadline date okay most most people don't set deadline dates for goals and so what i did was i was writing this book for a couple of years you know uh and it's this book back here of course 101 crucial lessons i don't teach in business school and i every time i met with somebody very very successful i'd ask for advice and i documented and then what happened was um i wrote down a deadline date that sunday before i flew back home the fourth day of the conference and i wrote i'll finish this book in two or three weeks and i flew home and it was a sunday night then on a monday morning i went into work and there's three general partners of ours in the firm myself included and i i just wasn't into it my heart wasn't into work that day and so around noon that day on that monday i said i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna go home guys i'll i'll see ya i'm just not feeling it and they were cool they're like all right chris we'll see you tomorrow or whenever right so um and and i could do that because there was there's three of us owned the fund so i went home and i started writing a little bit on that monday and then i couldn't stop it was like that jerry maguire movie um and when tom cruise was writing that business plan and i wrote for three days straight basically and by wednesday i published the book i publish the book and you all know how to publish a book it's easy to do you can always go to haroonventures.com right book all lowercase but i published it by that wednesday and you know what wonderful things started to happen to me in my life um i felt exhilarated uh and i i ended up not really going back to work i kind of did for a while but i wasn't into it but it that that changed me that event and that led me to want to just live my life my own terms and embrace my passion which is teaching and up to that point i had been teaching during the evenings at a couple san francisco bay area business schools mba and undergrad which i love doing and i would always teach during the evenings and i was never exhausted i felt like i just woke up i felt alive i felt alive it was amazing uh and so what i want to do is um i actually want to go through this book and i created a bunch of exercises for you so welcome to e12 that's entrepreneurship semester one class number two and as always please make sure you have the appropriate workbook open today it's really important that you download the book today or have it open in google docs but it works for you you can use google docs word or or or pdf because it's over 50 pages today and within the book you'll see on the cover page that there's eight numbers and so what we're going to do today is we're going to go through uh the first eight sections of the book and again there's going to be plenty of exercises here as well and as always i'll tell you exactly when to go to the book uh and and when to do the exercises let me just rearrange my screen here and touch uh there's a quote here um from this kind of ugly guy who has awful doubt humor um but he's a bit humble sometimes the quote is the best entrepreneurs don't think that the glass is half empty or half full they believe that the glass is overflowing and i really do believe that you know i always see the positives in life always always always you know what we think we perceive you know thoughts your thoughts become reality um so um yeah we're 28 through other way through uh this this course right now uh and so as i mentioned before um we're going to go through this book this book uh in a lot a lot of detail a lot of detail and uh i published this um not only on um on on kindle but also amazon the print version uh and many of my students uh i'm so happy to hear uh have started to publish your own books as well and i've got copies in here uh and i also published it on on on audible.com i went to acx.com and did it there and that's the cover of the book from audible and i have the cover of the book made by some dude um i can't remember where he is actually no it was a woman actually actually her name is ultra contu on fiverr.com and she's based in bangladesh and she's great so she made this cover yeah yeah um and then uh what happened was i'm humbled to say that uh per this this video here um it was forbes wrote an article saying this is one of six books every entrepreneur should read right now along with lean startup zero to one by peter thiel uh the selfmade um billionaire effect start with why by simon sinek and the seven habits of highly effective people by stephen covey i actually went to business school at columbia with stephen covey covey's kit yeah so this this kind of changed my life uh this this book uh and i i was very transparent in this book and i find that it's easier for me uh to read social media posts or books or articles if they're very very short when i was a kid i loved reading books by roald dahl he made james and the giant peach and charlie in the chocolate factory and that influenced me because roald dahl that his chapters were very very short it was just easy for me to to go through it and that's what i did with this book here as well i kept the chapters very very short uh and i'm humbled to say that it was also the number three bestseller i think the kindle version for a while on on on amazon it's still it's since trailed off a bunch troll off a bunch yeah but i had a lot of fun put this together so there's 17 sections in the book and we're going to talk about the book in two different parts and so as i mentioned before the first half of the book is today's is in today's workbook we're gonna do sections one through eight uh and then next class um we're gonna do the second half of the book and discuss sections nine through seventeen okay so let me show you what that means so if you go here to to the workbook um you'll see here that this is more than 50 pages and it might be the page link might be a little bit different depending on how many notes you take in this workbook as well as if you're using it on a different form factor or pdf version or the the word version microsoft word version but the contents are the same and so what i'll do is i will ask you to click on these numbers every now and then to start doing exercises and i'll make it very very intuitive to know exactly how to do this and when as well and so you click here and then you click down here now if you can't see a hyperlink here after you click this then go up here and just click section one two three etc and what i did also was i put here the table of contents for the first half of the book and if you're using the microsoft word version of this document or the google docs version you can click on any of these to jump right to these chapters in in the book um it doesn't work i don't think on the pdf version so just scroll to where you should be so i included actually all of um all the content of the book the first half at least today and i'll include the next half of the book in next class's workbook so if you go here to section one i i talk about here high level what we cover in section one i had a lot of fun with 3d images today too and then if you want you can type your notes here for lesson number one and below each lesson title is the actual text from the book and don't read this during class read it during during homework or on the side if you want to it's optional completely so you can take notes here on on lesson number one if you want to and what you've learned and what you can also do is if you go to the next lesson here number two you can take notes here again and again there's a text here from that chapter they're very short and you have to read the entire thing you can skim it or read another day all right so let me go back here to the top just we're on the same page does that work oh yeah good there we go good all right so um as i talk about all 101 lessons in today's class and next class as well um you can take down notes as i just showed you in in the uh in the workbook you downloaded today so let's start now with with topic number one so uh section number one uh is called relationships are more important than product knowledge um and uh i have a little catch phrase for all all the sections in the book so the first cache phrase for section one is crucial networking tips to make you more successful now we've covered a bunch of this before so i'm just going to go over what we've already covered very quickly so i can focus much more attention on the new stuff but it's always important to reemphasize what i've taught you before because repetition is the mother of all skill okay so the very first lesson is steve jobs winning strategy uh how to get anything you want um and and if you're watching the replay i mean the nonlive version of this lecture uh what you can do if you want uh is you can actually go to um go to chapter one here or i should say uh the uh lesson number one by going here and what you can do is just click on this video here to watch a short video of steve jobs uh and if you don't want to click on this you can just search for three words uh in uh in youtube which are steve jobs ask um and you will never get anything you want in life now if you don't ask and when we were younger growing up um we were kids we asked our parents all the time for stuff you know like my youngest one drives me crazy i love them though he says dad can i have some candy i'll say no literally a minute later he'll say can i ask him kenny now no and then he'll ask again like five he's relentless relentless uh and then what happens is you stop asking once you've been conditioned to stop doing that for whatever reason um and and you can be tactful when you ask and not overdo it and upset people obviously but what happens is once we're done with high school for a lot of us when we go to a university or or start our first job whatever it is we don't really ask for anything because we learn that if we keep our heads down and we get good grades then everyone's proud of us and life works better but then what happens is many years into your career you wake up one day and you look around and you think to yourself my goodness why are all these other people around me getting uh getting promoted and not me why are all these other less capable people around me getting raises and not me and you realize and it might be too late or it's never too late but sometimes it it takes you to your 40s till you realize this that if you want a raise or promotion you have to ask nobody's ever made ceo or ever raised a lot of money as an entrepreneur without asking over and over and over and over again and do you ever see somebody that is is kind of average looking and uh their significant other is unbelievably attractive and you wonder what's going on why how did that happen and it's not always about money okay um it's it's because the the person that's less attractive and and we we refer to this usually as the matching principle in psychology you know people that are they're both very good looking usually end up dating but there's always an exception and many exceptions and it's not just about money it's about the person who is maybe average looking or whatever just thinking themselves i've got nothing to lose and everything to gain i'm going to keep asking people out over and over and over again because i know that the pain from being rejected a bunch of times is nothing compared to the pleasure which is massive of being of this person saying yes to a date so to speak you got to be relentless and a lot of entrepreneurs are like that as well they're they're relentless they they they just don't stop they're aggressive they're aggressive and and they just don't they really don't care what people think of them either and that's why they're very very successful they don't give a damn what people think yeah so you got to be the same way as well sorry my stomach's grambling trembling here i got this new ninja bullet thing and i'm it's my new diet here kale blueberries etc gives me energy so you got to ask if you want anything in life you got to ask over and over and over and over and over and over again kind of like michael jordan i feel over and over and over again and that's why i succeed don't forget that please don't forget that you got to ask ask often be a pain in the neck and don't give a damn if you get rejected who gives a damn you know jk rowling she you know she she got rejected by like 29 or 30 publishers she didn't give a damn that people thought she was a failure who cares on the 30th they said yes and she's a billionaire now all right let's move on now to number two um how to get a job and why sending in a resume can be a waste of time there is a better way but even if you have an amazing resume and an amazing linkedin profile it's not enough you're gonna have to network like crazy you're gonna have to do a ton of informational meetings that's how you get jobs in this new digital reality that's just how it works because if you apply online you're one of a thousand people applying for a job and the dude that gets the job is usually the one that knows somebody at the company so and we've covered this a lot before so i'm gonna skip over this one here uh but your your your network is your net your your net worth yeah all right next up is uh business is about people and not about what you know um you know a big rookie mistake is going to any business meeting and just talking about business right away that doesn't matter dude it doesn't matter most jobs in the world are sales and most ceo roles you're a salesperson and if you're a partner in a law firm don't be a part of a law firm but if you're a partner in a law firm uh or or in a venture capital firm you're a sales person as well so how do they do it well they do it by bonding and we've talked a lot about this before bond before business so business is about people and and not what you know it's important to reinforce that now what you have to do also is uh in in i knew a guy who is the head of government sales at ibm in dc and i had um i had dinner with him one night with him and with uh mohit aaron uh who's the founder of a great company called cohisti when i was on mohit's board and uh it was a great it was a great dinner we we had dinner in palo alto and because this dude was at ibm and in a very senior role i asked him you know i said how did you get to where you got and he talked about how he learned a lot from working actually in politics and i said oh what do you mean by that he said well in in the early 90s i worked for george bush senior in the white house and uh i was like oh my gosh this is amazing i got to ask you questions um and so i asked him i said can you please give me the most important lesson you learned from work in the white house for bush senior why was he successful and this guy told me he said it's because uh bush senior would treat people like celebrities and celebrities like people so if if you ever meet a celebrity or somebody very senior in your company just treat like a dream like a normal person they'll feel uncomfortable if you treat me differently and if you meet somebody who's not so important whatever on how you classify what not so important means treat them like a celebrity as well you know ask a lot of questions ask them a lot of questions you know where'd you grow up and that sort of thing and just just learn from them just bond and don't forget to say people's names at least once or twice during during a longer conversation it's more personable that way and after you meet with anybody um connect with them immediately on linkedin as well and just remember their name and while you're going off script here but while you're talking to them what you got to do is you got to visualize and think about how you're going to remember their name and so uh when i was 19 i actually did the dale carnegie public speaking program and there's this woman named uh cynthia mustachio and i met her once there back when i was 19 like ages ago last century and her name was cynthia mustachio but i remember thinking to myself every time i see her i'm going to think she has a big mustache and so that's how i remember cynthia mustachio and you got to do the same thing as well what you can do is you when you when you meet people because it's really embarrassing man like if you go to a a party or something and you forget somebody's name it's embarrassing to just say hey you which is what i do sometimes to be intellectually honest but what i what i do it's awful for me it's the worst for me because my wife's name is the same name as me her name is christine i'm chris so everybody remembers chris and christine and so we go to parties and and i i do this actually this i probably shouldn't tell you this trick i'm going there anywhere i don't care fully transparent as always so if christine is beside me at a party and there's somebody beside me and i have no idea what their name is i forget i go like this i scratch my neck and then christine jumps in and introduces herself and at the end of the night i've lost like eight layers of skin just kidding on my neck yeah but it works but you got to remember people's names and do name association as well if you can and so when you meet somebody if their first name uh is uh similar to a rock star's name or the same as a rock star's name uh then just think of it that way like if you meet somebody named bob um just just think of bob dylan you know singing a song or in an interview saying hey you know you can't really understand it but it's it's silly visualization i get it but you'll never forget it yeah yeah all right all right uh next and and also um not not just rock stars but think of i think of actors as well when you meet somebody or something really really silly really silly like like cynthia mustachio okay moving on all right next up um i want you to meet people have fun and learn and there's no reason why i threw in baby yoda here other than the fact that i think that baby yoda is adorable um no but in all seriousness um when i went down to wall street to work at goldman i was so nervous man i i was nervous because i i thought and i remember that time really well i had nirvana's song in my head dumb nirvana had it one of the early albums it was great there's a song called dumb and it goes i think i'm dumb i think i'm dumb and i remember when i was at goldman i remember thinking to myself if i don't say anything ever to anybody they might think i'm dumb but if i actually open my mouth and start talking they'll know i'm dumb and then the kirk cobain track would go on and on and on in my head perception becomes reality you got to get that out of your mind and so i told myself three things which assuaged my concerns you know when i went down and in hindsight i would have told myself fourth and the fourth thing would have been god already knows what's gonna happen so just don't worry just enjoy it don't question your faith but the three things i told myself at the time when i went down to goldman um was and i and i loved the power of three as you know uh in all my presentations and in everything um you know what i would say was uh i all i want to do is i want to meet people have fun and learn that's it those are my goals that's it and it was great because i met a ton of people my network is amazing partially because of that i enjoyed it i had fun i never saw it as works i conditioned myself to enjoy it i learned a ton and once you stop learning you got to move on to another job so if you're you're ever nervous about a new job don't worry because when you start a brand new job i don't care how old or young you are they're not going to give you like mission critical stuff right away especially when you're younger you know you're not going to show up first day and they're going to say write me a proposal on on if ibm should buy red hat which they already did but you know what i mean um don't worry when you show up you go through a training program or you'll you'll get mentors whatever or you'll photocopy like i did uh which i did with pleasure because i read all the stuff when i was photocopying when i worked at accenture i learned meet people have fun and learn all right next up we've got the importance of sincere gratitude and so this is a a great book here by the dalai lama called the art of happiness which i i read on my honeymoon actually um and i read this actually we were in um we were in bali and i bought the book and i read it there such a beautiful place to read that book too i loved it and the indonesian people were so nice oh my god they're incredible but read this book if you get a chance because it will really help you understand the importance of of of gratitude you know be grateful for something different every day and with my kids um when i put them into bed and we say prayers and my oldest one andrew he's too cool for school whatever i don't i don't do president anymore he's but he's old or whatever but my other two kids i do uh and um during prayers i i asked them to thank god every night for something new uh and so the we've knew it for years it's i mean it's getting crazy now they're like thank you god for blue smarties but you know what i mean if you're grateful for something different see if we're still recording okay good if you're grateful for something different every single day uh it'll get you into peak mental states and so i practice gratitude every day before i get up you know i say prayer and i thank god for ten things in this order always andrew matthew dylan christine mom dad jamie k elizabeth and my students you you so anyway that that's what i do and andrew matthew dylan are my kids matthew andrew dylan mad or dylan andrew matthew dam yeah matter damn yeah yeah now you'll never forget the initials of my kids mad or damn there we go so practice gratitude please a lot a lot uh focus on on on the beautiful things you have in your life not the material things but friends loved ones you know your parents are gonna love you no matter what happens no matter what happens they're gonna love you forever yeah and so your kids your spouse whatever your buddies that sort of thing be grateful for what you have and don't buy things by experiences okay next up your alma maters okay where you went to school the network matters a lot and so keep in contact it's a wonderful thing because a lot of times you'll learn more from your fellow classmates than you will from your teacher it's true it's true so one of the best networks you can have is a school network and you don't have to go to harvard business school for that any network really any network so your alma maters just remember that okay uh next up is a crucial post meeting networking best practice so it's really simple after every single meeting you have in business for the rest of your life that day i want you to connect with that person or the people you met that day using linkedin please do it please do it um because your your net worth is your your network so to speak uh and when people size you up uh and they look at at who you are and which contacts you have in common if you have a lot of secondary connections with somebody meaning uh contacts in common or whatever it is um then they're they're more likely gonna take you a little bit more seriously yeah it costs you nothing too it costs you nothing all right um and then um i think that's it yeah we're done now with uh with section number one which is relationships are more important than product knowledge and so what i want you to do now please is i want you to go to your workbook and i want you to click on number one meaning section one okay on the front page so i'll do that i'll come right back here so if i'm the first page now i'm going to click here on number one and if you can't click on this for some reason then what you can do is just click up here on section one it's the same thing okay so and that will take us right here to section one relationships are more important than product knowledge okay now what i want you to do is i want you to spend three minutes please right now writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons that we just talked about in section one to enhance your career and i wrote here chris will show you how to do this during class okay i guess i'll show you how to do this during class and i wrote that myself so all you do is you just go here and you just write notes it's that simple um and if you're using the pdf version um i actually set up this field here so that if you type a lot of notes uh it'll a vertical scroll bar will appear here so you can keep writing notes forever um so yeah take three minutes and what i want you to do is i want you to think about how you applying the lessons in section one can enhance or improve your career or your life make you happier so what you'll do is this is pretty easy you'll write something here if you want to okay it's it's optional and then and you can read the the chapters later if you want you can write something here lesson two it's optional and let me just go to five here um oh six whatever yeah right right down here the important sincere gratitude type

one of the boxes just leave it or you can even do it for homework so you got three minutes to do this go so so so section two be longterm greedy use these crucial longterm strategies and watch your net worth soar so this here is mars in a cyber truck elon musk cyber truck it's tough to see i i screwed up the the graphic there let me go back here but i included it for for a reason in the 3d model and i did it because uh elon musk is so longterm focused um that he ignored all the naysayers when it comes to you know creating battery operated cars um he he ignored the naysayers that that tell him that he shouldn't try to get into the industrial car market as well meaning trucks he ignores the naysayers by thinking about colonizing mars out there i know but he's very longterm focused and that's one of the many reasons why he's extraordinarily successful all right let's talk about the first lesson here the longer the view the wiser the intention and that's a wonderful street there that graphic of uh lombard street which is here in san francisco now it's a very long and winding road yeah so um you got to be very very longterm focused and warren buffett said the longer the view the wisely intention i completely believe in it you know you got to be very very longterm focused you know don't just chase trends here and there you know what's a hot market now with the hot market tomorrow went up think longer term write your 10 year goals out and figure out how are you going to make that those 10year goals become a reality be longterm focused fill the gap just be longterm focused and the best entrepreneurs i know are the ones that are very very longterm focused um so just just write down your goals often and think longer term okay next up uh we've got uh learn earn return watch this video here i'm on the board of this charity watch this we've always been told we're not smart enough they say we lack the talent to get to the next level that we don't care enough about our community together we breathe different the air is different where we're from it's a place where greatness is organic and homegrown where the journey to greatness is watered and nourished with the sweat and tears of hard work humbly rooting the deep soils of discipline and sacrifice this place is not meant for everyone we're a family and we set the bar high we push further than anyone else we sacrifice anything at any time and we live every moment chasing greatness life skills performance is our game changer we don't eat until everyone is eating it's not about us anymore it's about our family our community academic performance is our ultimate weapon knowledge is power and it cannot be taken away from us sports performance is our secret we don't train just to train we train to be the best mediocrity is not acceptable suck pain is temporary quitting is forever in our family we're hungry for greatness hard work is all we know we understand the difference between good and great and that's why we prepare so that no one can take away what is ours greatness inspires greatness at the limo farm so i'm very proud and humbled to say that i'm on the board of directors of of the the limo foundation it's an amazing organization um and the founder there david um who has given the speech he's so inspirational he's amazing and i believe that everybody deserves a second chance and he always says that you need to learn earn and then return and i completely believe it and let me tell you a little bit more about david because i think we all do deserve a second chance um so david's brother is is on death row for um for yeah i'm not gonna go there but you can probably guess why and so uh david um he grew up um in east palo alto and east palo alto in america like in america you get really rich area and then kind of a scary neighborhood pretty quickly it's just it's just it's a land of extremes sometimes as much as i love this country but in east palo alto the high school graduation rate is only 40 percent and there's there's a lot of deadbeat fathers i don't think there's such thing as a debbie mother uh and so um david actually got a scholarship uh to go to a great school called juniperocera it's a private allboys school and i was gonna send my kids there as well um and i went to an event there a charity event and he gave a great speech that inspired me and changed my life in in that school there's a lot of athletes there too like greg jeffrey's great baseball player went there so did barry bonds and the best quarterback in history i can't remember his name right now but you guys all know his name um yeah he's dating gisele i think anyway tom brady i think yeah but um when i saw david give a speech there and by the way i decided not to send my kids to that school um i they all go to public school which is the it's i think it's better than prep i won't go there if you won't ask why i'll i'm happy to go there too but but in that that that uh that event uh david was keynote speech speaker um and he said something it changed my life um and he grew up in in east palo alto and got a scholarship to go to that school but he said don't expect to accomplish your dreams in life unless you help others accomplish theirs first let me say that again don't expect to accomplish your dreams in life unless you help others accomplish theirs first i believe in that i really do and and david has turned his life around as well he actually spent time in jail as well for robbing a safeway uh grocery store here when he was a he was a kid everybody deserves a second chance and so what we do in the limo foundation and i've donated a lot of money for scholarships there etc i'll continue to do so is um what we do is the people that work at limo they'll they'll pick up these these kids from really poor areas uh in the morning they'll give them full scholarships to the best private schools the best private schools they'll drive them to school then after school is done so they don't get into trouble doing bad stuff or whatever it is after school is done they'll bring them back to limo headquarters which is close to east palo alto and um they have a sports facility as you saw in that video and a lot of computers as well and then what they'll do is they'll help the students with their homework if they need help then they'll drive them back home by seven or eight o'clock at night and they do this every day every weekday and it's a wonderful thing because you're giving a chance to to all these underprivileged kids from tough backgrounds and i love them to death you know i i love them so much more because they come from a tough background and there's potential everybody i got to show you going off script again but whatever so i want to show you um these kids they're amazing and the reason i i created my course an entire mba one course was because of lima so so what i did was if i go to my home page if i scroll down the bottom here charity yeah it's here i think yeah so yeah these are the cherries i'm ball with so here's limo foundation and this is this is them they're amazing they're incredible but there's also pictures here i want to show you as well so right here this here is a it'll scroll through in a second here so this here is a picture of one of the amazing limo students uh and this is me in january of 2016 a day that changed my life um and and what happened was i i told david i said david why don't we why don't you let me teach all the limo students on a saturday and and i'll call it um an entire nba one one day and i hand made all these degrees for them and that was at the end of that one day and i gave my book as well now these these kids are great uh and i want to show you this actually this is this is what i want to show you the kids that were there that day they ranged from the ages of of um of nine uh to 17. and we spent 12 hours there and this was actually in longitude capitals venture capital headquarters in menlo park it was uh patrick one of one of the guys on the board let us use his office good dude uh and actually lilika right here um she graduated she she's i think she was at the san francisco art institute after she finished high school and she's on my board as well i'm proud to say and this dude here is nine and the oldest here was 17 at the time and the whole day when i was teaching them and the course is only eight hours on udemy but the version here i made it 12 hours a bit longer and the whole day when i was teaching them this every one of these kids including this dude here who's nine their eyes were wide open all day like they weren't blinking they were just oh my god like somebody's paying attention to me this is awesome their questions were brilliant and what fires me up is getting people that have been given a crappy set of cards in life and helping them achieve their dreams that fires me up that makes me more happy than me accomplishing my own dreams and there's potential in everybody which is why i do what i do and all these kids have gone on to do wonderful things wonderful things so far and you know again this was back in 2016 in january and i created these degrees for all of them um yeah i went to an art shop and i bought stickers it was fun and then what happened was this that was on a saturday then on i think it was a sunday i put my course online on on udemy my mba course and i think it might have been by a monday or so that business insider wrote an article that got shared hundreds of thousands of times and it took off it took off uh and it changed my life and everything i do like like teaching all of you the genesis is that day which changed my life right there don't expect to accomplish your dreams until you help others accomplish theirs first i really believe in that and so david said learn earn return just remember that make that the cornerstone of your life as well and your philosophy learn earn return it's simplistic and throughout your life like don't wait until you're worth a fortune to return you know give give time as well and i went to a columbia business school and i remember it was a henry kravis henry kravis is the number one private equity dude in history and um i'll show you i'll show you what it looks like here so he actually uh henry kravis uh there's more pictures of the students there so henry kravis kind of created the private equity market we kind of talked about him a bit when we were doing that that that case study with all the hats with disney a while back uh but um henry kravis he went to columbia and he was a straight c student grades don't matter that's right uh and what he did was he actually um he came to school and i was really excited because i thought that henry kravis was going to talk about deals and i read a great book when i was a kid called barbarians at the gate which talks about how henry kravis and others bought uh nabisco which stands for the national biscuit company took it private made a fortune and so he showed up at columbia one day to lecture and and instead of warren buffett one day too which is cool that he's also an alum there and i couldn't wait to learn about deals and he talked for an hour and a half all he talked about was just not giving money but giving your time of course he donates money too but giving your time uh and and i gained a tremendous amount of respect for him and he's totally right he's totally right you gotta you got to donate your time and do charity work throughout your entire career okay you really really do um and if you give you will get it's prophetic it's true it's been true since being a time you know give and you will receive so just remember that learn earn return and to quote david for the limo foundation before we move on to lesson 11. don't expect to accomplish your goals or dreams in life until you help others accomplish theirs first all right next up is number 11 the harder you work the luckier you get all right and that's of course a fourleaf clover it's true though like you will get a break you will get a break um you know if you're working your ass off and nothing is working out for you in your life nothing just keep at it keep at it you will get a break eventually you know like michael jordan said i failed over and over and over again and that's why i succeed you will get your lucky break i promise you you will one day and you look back and you'll be grateful to god that you had these potential failures or career setbacks early on because it actually guided you down a different path in life you might not understand that now but i promise you will one day i promise you you know years ago i was down and out i did everything right i worked for somebody i made him a fortune um he took all the credits and people loved me on the team and i was probably too good at my job and so yeah you know what he did to me and i remember calling my dad i said dad i don't get it like i work so hard you know and and i try to be a good person i try to give back and mentor and do what i can do and i made the company so much money and this shark you know this this awful person who i'll never name it's just i'll turn the other cheek i guess but i i told my dad about it and he's like chris you won't understand this one day but you'll look back years from now and and you'll be grateful uh that it happened because somehow it set you down a different path i said dad that doesn't make any sense um and i said it respectfully obviously i'm very respectful of my parents and then my dad he said chris what i want you to do is go to the old testament the old testament is kind of the basis for many great religions whatever and he said i want you to read the book of job which is prophetic because jay would be his job it's about this guy that lost everything and he didn't lose his faith and then much much later years later everything worked out for him and he kind of understood why things were the way they were so the harder you work the luckier you get you will get that lucky break okay just remember to keep failing over and over and over again and not giving a damn what anybody thinks and i promise you i promise you i guarantee it you will get your lucky break the harder you work the luckier you get all right next up is the most important investment you will ever make the most important investment you'll ever make is investment in you don't ever be cheap when it comes to education so if if there's a book you want to download or read and you're like i don't know man it's like it's like 10 bucks i don't know if i should don't be cheap just do it you know subscribe to audible.com it's like 10 or 15 bucks a month you can listen to two books every month from i don't know whoever your whoever your inspirations are listen to biographies or autobiographies on successful people they share their blueprint with you they give give give give gift you know they put they let their cards be seen by everybody because they've already made it and a lot of people that are very very successful the reason they were successful or became successful is because they gave remember in the first couple classes we talked about that book give and take and how the richest 1 people in the world you know are our givers the middle 98 percenter takers and the poorest one percent of my favorite uh the mother teresa's of the world that were never concerned about making money whatever yeah it's so funny though because it's coming full circle now but mother teresa there's this guy that went to that school sarah that david from the limo foundation went to and so the first year i went to that that charity event at limo or a party at sarah and i saw dave give that speech where he said don't expect to accomplish your goals or dreams until you help others accomplish theirs first the second year i went back as well as another charity event and i donated again i didn't send my kids to private school because i think public school is better better but the second year when i was there the guy that gave the keynotes and it was a tough act to follow because david's amazing the guy that gave the keynote was a guy that went to sarah as well who was um who was mother teresa's photographer so um and and he showed us some wonderful pictures i got to show you something give me i'm going off script i i don't give a damn um i'm gonna stand up here in my my lululemon sweats uh and walk around and find something to show you i almost fell down there but i'm okay all right um here it is see if it's in the picture i think it is um mother teresa said peace begins with a smile i love that it's so true it's so true peace does begin with a smile i i love her to death lover did that somebody's got to make a great movie about her she's probably my probably one of my favorite people that ever ever walked this great earth i'm so humbled to say i walked this earth at the same time she did i never got to meet her yeah but but she's wonderful she's wonderful and i'll put this up here actually yeah actually i'll put it right here so you can see both quotes okay all right and this here by the way if you're curious is how um we can tell if the the color is correct when we go into post edit so i have it face every single camera just to make sure that the color matches because when i change the colors behind me it messes up the pigment of my skin sometimes yeah yeah yeah all right because in some videos i look like ernie or bert all right all right next next up is um yeah oh oh yes so in terms of the most important investment you'll ever make it's an investment in you um education always always always don't ever be cheap when it comes to education if your dream was to go to i don't know yale medical school um and you know yeah you're worried about the money don't be just get in first and then figure it out you'll figure it out i actually there's this one guy i was friends with growing up and his mom used to always brag about him yeah and and his name was uh was was rick uh and he got into yale and his mom was bragging saying uh you know you know my son he got into jail so if your goal is to go to jail or or yale uh then um but but the money's an issue just get in first and you you get a scholarship you'll figure it out if you want something bad enough in life you'll always figure it out always figure it out but when it comes to smaller things in life like you know buying a book for education if you're on the fence just buy it dude just do it just do it don't be cheap when it comes to investing in yourself it's the best investment you'll ever make in yourself all right next up we've got uh learn what not to do um and i had so much fun creating these graphics here uh and and i was that guy that didn't watch game of thrones for years because i tried and then my kids were around so i'd have to turn it off and i try again later and there's eight million different characters and i just couldn't keep up there's too many characters man it's complicated eh uh and so uh i included that the bad dude there um something walker ice walker or something yeah bad guy and i show him because i i worked for people that should not be managing people they're they're awful awful people to work for and i did learn from them because i learned what not to do and so my attitude could have been negative forever but i told myself you know what two things number one i'm learning how not to treat people and number two this guy's such a jerk that he's actually helping me because he's motivating me to you know work hard on getting a better job and improve myself so i'm never complacent so when you work for other people learn what not to do as much as possible as much as possible all right i think i'm going to take that down because i'm not sure about the glare i think it's fine but it might mess things up here but just remember peace begins with it with a smile yeah and i've got this great quote here which which i used to use in a lot of my keynotes um and it's from a great poet american poet um a real renaissance man actually um and he lived here in san francisco for a while his name is mark twain uh and a lot of people don't realize that san francisco although it's california is not warm you know it's cold especially in the summer the warm season's the fall and so mark twain once said the coldest winter i ever spent was a summer in san francisco but mark twain also said the two most important days in your life are number one the day you're born and number two the day you find out why and hopefully through the soulsearching process of this entire mba degree including today's class next class on 101 crucial lessons my book hopefully that will help you to find your why okay all right so learn not what not to do when you work for schmucks there is light at the end of the tunnel and it is not an oncoming train all right so we are now done uh with uh with section two so what i want you to do now is another exercise so just go here click on section two or go up here and click on section two and then what you're going to do is um just take a couple minutes to write down here your thoughts on how thinking long term can help your career do the same for learn earn return if you want to as well as the hard work you'd like you get all the ones here in number two up until you see section three here okay great so you've got three minutes to do this go so section three avoiding burnouts i wrote here at the top avoid these crucial landmines and save your career and your life and it's killing me that there's no end of quote there or the end of bracket at the end there but that's good enough i'm going to leave it here because i want to prove a point that you'll never accomplish anything in life if you try to be a perfectionist okay if if you want to don't be a perfectionist if you want to vlog or blog or create some sort of youtube video and what's holding you back is you don't publish it because it's not perfect and you care what people are going to think screw it just do it as sir richard branson says screw it let's do it so i'm going to leave that that parenthesis oh my god i talk a lot i'm going to leave that parenthesis or close bracket out of it there so avoid burnout is section 3. and it is getting hot in here speaking of matches all right so uh lesson 14 is what to do the second you return from vacation and i worked when i was at goldman years ago one of my clients uh rhonda chang just a brilliant woman that worked at manulife which is a big insurance company that's canadian most people don't realize that and i was kind of stressed out and she said chris let me give you some advice and of course i didn't take her advice but i listened to it her advice was this the second you come back from vacation what i want you to do is i want you to open up your calendar and book your next vacation six months out that's the first thing you should do when you come back from vacation open your calendar and book your next vacation six months out otherwise you will burn out you will burn out yeah so it's um and it's i i gotta keep remembering this too so the second you return from vacation i want you to book your next vacation all right next up is uh stress will kill you don't be the gazelle i was watching national geographic years ago and it was this poor gazelle being chased uh by by by a a i think it was a cheetah or a tiger i can't remember and the gazelle was not caught thank goodness but national geographic put sensors on the gazelle to monitor the gazelles heart rates and other bodily functions and what happened was this the gazelle was running for their for the for its life and so obviously the heart was pumping really fast you know pumping quickly getting as much blood as possible you know circling around the body and what happened was the heart and the mind focused entirely on survival and as a result the heart and the mind i guess somehow shut down the immune system while the the gazelle was running running for its life and the heart and the mind also shut down the reproductive system and the gazelle aged a bit when it was being chased as well so the reproduction of functions shut down it aged faster and also it could get sick quicker because all the heart and mind was focused on was pumping more blood and surviving that's stress stress can kill you and so the only reason we're supposed to feel stressed like that in our lives is if you know going back to caveman times or whatever you're being chased by a dinosaur or whatever it is somebody that wants to take your life that's when you feel stress not all the time at work a lot of times stress is up here you know i i i feel stressed probably because i'm making myself stressed so don't be the gazelle just chill out man and what happens is conceiving having a baby is not it's not as easy as most people think um that that haven't had kids before you know we're we're very blessed that you know christine and i got pregnant pretty quickly with with all three three boys we wanted to have a daughter as well and usually people that have two kids have a girl and a boy and they're done um but anyway i love all three of my boys the same um but if we had a daughter be it'd be it'd be awesome too it'd be awesome too wholly off topic but a lot of people when they're trying to conceive trying to have a child it's so stressful and i remember for christine and i too the first time we want to have a kid there was a pregnancy test she bought it and the second i we found out she wasn't i was like damn it it was stressful you know because it's why are we here you know it says it's kids that's one of the reasons the why right but and then eventually obviously things worked out great for us but we have friends that have tried everything in vitro spending a gazillion dollars whatever trying to have kids and it's so stressful in their marriage and then they they conclude that maybe we just can't get pregnant and they do something wonderful they adopt adoption's a beautiful thing and then what happens is after they adopt this happens a lot a couple months later they get pregnant naturally because they weren't feeling stress don't be the gazelle please don't be the gazelle just just chill out it's all up here a lot of the stress you're doing it to yourself you're doing it to yourself it's all up here perception becomes reality so just condition yourself not to be stressed and maybe what you do every day is let me go back here every day on on your daily sheet here you do what i do which is when i wake up in the morning the first thing i do is um well i say prayer but i also thank god for 10 different things maybe what you do is part of your your daily sheet here you you can change this if you want to and at the end of today's lecture i'm going to remind you where to go get this and how to change this in powerpoint or other programs but you can change it so that this is your gratitude section here so you write down what your gratitude about or get rid of that section and have a gratitude section whatever it is along with writing your goals and your schedule for the next day as well okay don't be the gazelle please all right avoid burnout avoid burnout yeah all right next up we have got um when to take a day off when you are not sick this is important dude so are you ever kind of in a bad mooc because you're kind of i don't know you're kind of stressed at work and you didn't get enough sleep whatever and things aren't going that great at home temporarily and so you're not feeling great mentally physically you're fine but you go to work and you go to work and you might not be as nice as always put it mildly or you might be a little bit cold to somebody at work or you might be you're supposed to give a presentation and a lot of important people are around and you just stressed out man you should never have shown up to work that day to begin with and so i think it's important to take at least one or two days off a year when physically you're not sick but mentally you're not all there it's important and you can tell people you're sick because you are you know you're mentally kind of just feeling burned out it's a great investment to make yourself and i made this red the bottle here red on purpose uh supposed to be pills um it looks like it's clothing red on the outside i put the wrong thing on it whatever but but it on purpose to make a point just it's a sense of urgency when you're mentally drained do not whatever you do do not go to work that day whatever you do is going to hurt you more than help you all rights lord oh this is the ten commandments these laws unto thy people hear me oh hear me all pay heed the lord the lord jehovah has given unto you these fifteen like ten ten commandments for all to obey i love that that was one of the first movies i ever saw uh when i was a kid it was called history of the world part one uh by mel brooks and my dad took me the movie i don't think he realized it was gonna be some parts weren't supposed to be supposed to be shown to kids but that was before uh indiana jones in the temple of doom came out in 82 or 83 because that movie indiana jones off script whatever indiana jones in the temple of doom that was the that was the first movie that was um uh that that that should not have been pg it should have been a a which they got rid of and so because of temple of doom they created something called pg13 which is another category of of of raiding movies but that was uh that was uh mel brooks obviously very very funny man um and so i i i bring up the ten commandments it's not a religious thing here but um you know those ten rules are the basis for a lot of laws in in many wonderful countries and the basis for a lot of religions too but when those 10 rules were made thousands of years ago one they they knew our four mothers and forefathers that we need to take time off or we'll burn out it's human nature which hasn't changed in thousands of years and you know the rule is to rest on the sunday or saturday or whatever it is just one day a week one day a week you got to take off that one day a week at least and spend time with your family uh and you know just get just just focus on getting yourself centered so to speak get outside your body and kind of take a look uh see the forest from the trees um where are you in your life and what are you here for anyway and you know what what what's your why what's your longterm goals are you happy at work in your relationships whatever um are you bonding enough with your kids because by the time your kids are 13 years old you've already are 12 years old you've already spent 90 of the time you'll ever spend with them so just that's precious man like screw work if you can every now and then you know just skip work to go to mommy or daddy daddy child breakfast day at school because i missed andrews years ago and i don't know why i must have had an important meeting that was so important i can't remember it today but i do remember missing andrew daddy day at breakfast at school um so anyway you can't get that time back and take as many pictures as you can too before your kids get old just savor every second because they go fast man and my third son dylan my youngest son he said dad why is it there's not as many pictures of me as there are from my older brothers andrew matthew and i said of course there's enough it's the same and he counted them too right smart kid so i went to bed that night and i woke up and i looked at my night table and there are actually a couple pictures of him and me put in frames he went and he found them and they're still there now and this was years ago years ago yeah you you can't get that time back uh so just remember that uh you will burn out if you don't take time off uh it doesn't matter what what religion you are and who cares it's you gotta take one day off a week at least or you will burn out and they say that god rested on the seventh day and dude even there's this there's this uh amazing company uh that's uh it's it's in new york city and it's where i buy a lot of my uh my photo equipment from and it's called uh b h uh and i bought actually uh this camera here from from b h and a lot of my audio equipment as well this dude as well i buy from amazon too uh b h is in new york city and it was founded in 1973 and it's it's amazing great customer service great prices uh they always have stuff in stock if they can't they'll get it for you immediately like these the lights i'm using up above here they couldn't find them anywhere they're out of stock everywhere and i called them and they walked through walls for me there they're the best but you cannot buy anything from them when the sun goes down on fridays so let's go there right now actually it's 2 21 in new york or san francisco time which means it's 5 21 new york time um i don't know if they're they're probably they're probably still let's see you can you can put stuff in your basket but you can't buy it b h and i want to show this to you because i want to impress upon you just how they're so awesome and they still take off a day a week and they're still amazing so um let me see here is it sundown yet not yet not yet but i'm just going to put something in a basket for fun okay let's go here to microphones okay and let's go to i've actually got that one running right here as well on this camera yeah and this one too scary all right so watch this add to cart let's see what happens okay view cart okay it's still open now but if i were to do it you could try this yourself in an hour from now it would not work it wouldn't work so anyway a little on top there okay great so we are now done uh with uh with section number three uh and so the exercise is go to your workbook and click here on number three okay uh and oh there's a mistake there that's my mistake you won't see this in your version but i have to change the hyperlink so the way you do that is this so you go here let me just delete the hyperlink you go here and you and it's similar in word as well you go to link and the way you link it is it looks at the table of contents like heading ones and heading twos so what i want to do is i want to put in section three give me a second section three there good a plea reply click here good yeah cool so go here uh and take three minutes to to complete uh all the lesson boxes here if you want to again it's optional um so you got three minutes to do this go so let's move on to topic number four so topic number four is called create off the charts confidence wear that superman cape uh and at the top there it says crucial confidence lessons to help your career take off i love this section i love this section because confidence is entirely up here it's a light switch just flick it on just flick it on okay all right so the first lesson that we're going to talk about here in section number four is that there are no limits there are no limits and that's a ford mustang down there because henry ford said um whether or not you think you can do it you are right let me say that again whether or not you think you can do it you are right it's all up here i know it sounds so simplistic so simplistic but confidence is merely a light switch so just remember the past does not equal the future so if something brings you down confidence wise it never happened erase it from your mind or at least don't think about it at all whether or not you think you can do it you're right it's all up here there are no limits except the limits that we set for ourselves okay number 19 is the glass is always full always full and for those you're not familiar with that term there's a saying that if somebody sees a glass that's that has water up to the halfway mark negative people will say the glasses have empty and positive people will say no the glass is half full so perception becomes reality you know it's like the rodan sculpture i think therefore i am and so this glass here um is not half full it's it's overflowing in my mind and people think that i'm naively positive but i think the most positive people in the world are the only ones that can change the world okay i think all of you if you're very positive you can put your dent in the universe and change the world as well so i got to be careful because this thing is really overflowing whoa all right the glass is not half half full it's overflowing my cup overfloweth with optimism all right next up we have got um a balanced life means a more it means you're more productive in business um and we talked about this before so i don't go into much too much detail on that but you know there's there are many people in life that are incredibly wellrounded you know they they're in great shape they have a great family life um you know they've got a great social life they do well at work uh they're happy because they're balanced because they're balanced um and so if you're balanced and if you take your breaks as well i mean take that one day off per week uh then you'll be much more successful as well let me go i want to go back and i'm really curious to see if uh b h is open right now and and i have to bring this up because i mean this inspires me dude so b and h again they take that one day off a week let's see here um since 1973 it looks like no there's they're still they're still open but i will come back to this in a little while uh let's go begin checkout i'm not going to buy this obviously okay it doesn't say anything yet okay but once we're sundown uh in in new york that's when this will this will uh go to they'll shut it down okay sundown in new york i know it's crazy um but it's 701 p.m okay so three okay so an hour and 15 minutes i'll i'll try again later but if you're balanced in life you'll be much more productive and don't forget to fill out that daily schedule as well because that will help you be much more balanced all right let's move on number 21 there's luigi that's from luigi's mansion okay um number twenty it's great having kids because you get to be a kid all over again yeah um so number 21 is you're never as nervous uh as you sound um you know although you might not think you're confident and you might think you don't look confident when you're up there on the stage in front of the world when you feel nervous you don't look or sound nervous don't worry about it don't worry about it and who gives a when anybody thinks you anyway i don't care that's what you got to tell yourself okay luigi all right next up uh we've got avoid those people okay and i had to have another video game uh reference here not just nintendo but this here is for i guess ps4 and an xbox uh that's a character who i'm embarrassed to say is canadian in the game his name is trevor he's a bad bad person and he is from grand theft auto 5. and i'm smiling because in one scene he has a canadian accent as he takes on the u.s military it's a little bit funny but he's a bad dude and you got to avoid those people and when i say those people i mean anybody that that hurts your confidence or brings you down you know you're you're you're not a tree you can move move away from these people cut them out of your life that's right that's right get them out of your life you know if you've got a little bird on your shoulder um or a devil or whatever it is saying you're not good enough you're not good enough you're not good enough get rid of that person get it out of your life get that person out of your life so avoid those people and go with your gut your gut is always right you know when you're a lot younger like i was it was you know 10 strikes you're out now it's one strike you're out or maybe two sometimes but just avoid anybody in your life that makes you unhappy get them out of your life you know get them out of your mind they don't own you they can't control you get rid of them that's right change your environment you'll change your life as well somebody brings you down just get rid of them man get rid of them so anyway see you trevor all right all right this number 23 is that person speaks gooder than me and he's supposed to have glasses there i think i cut them off and i was trying to get rid of the transparent background there yeah so don't ever get intimidated by people that you think might have a better vocabulary than you or people that might have a different accent than you don't be intimidated by them because a lot of times the reason why they might be well spoken is because they're very arrogant or maybe they went to a great school because their parents went there and it's legacy that's how they got in just because somebody sounds confident or arrogant don't let the perception be that that fools you that they're right uh or more often right than you are you know confidence does not lead to uh to competence it might lead to perceived competence but not confidence in general so don't don't ever get intimidated by anybody that that speaks gooder than you at all has nothing to do with success in life it just bring you know it might have something to do with they were born with a silver spoon in their mouth and and i'd rather not hire somebody that was born with a silver spoon in their mouth because they're entitled i want somebody that's poor smart and hungry or somebody that's humble that's important to me so don't ever get intimidated by that and my dad actually he uh when he immigrated from from egypt uh to and i didn't know my dad had an accident until i was like 20 or so or 19 or 18 when i moved out um he sounds a bit like james earl jones uh this is cnn or or simba's father or whatever um but but i remember my dad told me when he first moved to canada it was really frustrating because he had to support himself by by he immigrated in 1967 he left egypt and he bribed an army official to get him to fail the eye exam for the crazy army or whatever was some stupid war in the middle east in 67. so my dad came to canada and in order to pay for himself here support himself before he met my mama um he uh he worked in a hospital cleaning test tubes and the nurses would all make fun of him uh because of his accent and he couldn't speak the language that well uh and uh you know he he could have just kind of given up uh or or just kind of accepted it and had it killed his confidence but uh he didn't he channeled that frustration uh and started his own company and so in hindsight i'm sure he's happy uh that uh that that happened yeah yeah so anyway and then he met my mama my mom is actually was a nurse or she isn't yeah she's still alive she she was a nurse and my dad's pickup line was uh jackie do you have a tylenol he asked my mom for tylenol my dad's a doctor yeah so anyway we love you dada so don't get intimidated by anybody with a different accent or someone speaks gooder than you because they're probably entitled dude and you peel back the onion a couple layers and they're nothing compared to you all right um and just remember number 24 is nobody is smarter than you okay and in the book i i think i put a a link to um let's go here to number 24. it's lesson number 24. yeah here it is here yeah i have a link here to a a short video from steve jobs that will change your life it's like a minute or two long um how nobody is smarter than you and once you realize that i'm not telling you to be arrogant but once you realize that you're money you know i i believe you and i believe in you once you believe in yourself you'll never be the same you'll never be the same because you'll be able to accomplish anything you want to in life just remember that nobody is smarter than you okay just remember that confidence is everything dude it's everything everything like i remember when i grew up in canada and um i was kind of reserved a little shy canadian uh humble proud of my roots um and i remember it was it was the 80s and ronald reagan was my hero and i remember though that the the cover of newsweek and time magazine at the time was the downfall of the american student and how the american student is 50th in the world of math and 50th in the world in science it's a downfall of the american student and every couple of years you see the same stupid headlines americans are 25th or 50th in math whatever sciences it doesn't matter and i learned something when i started um when i started teaching here during the evenings years ago in the san francisco bay area and about 50 percent of my students at least were born overseas okay so this is not an american thing what i'm about to say but yeah about 50 percent of my students and about 50 percent of people live here in the bay area and about 50 of the founders in the bay area and about 50 percent of the engineers here in the bay area were born overseas you know people like pierre omidjar the wonderful humanitarian he's uh he's he's person he's from iran and of course he founded ebay you got elon musk who splits his time uh between here actually owns a house not too far away from me now here in hillsborough uh he splits his time between here in southern california but but elon musk who also lived in canada for years but but he's from south africa yeah you got um sergey brin and one of the brilliant cofounders of uh of google was born in russia um so you've got this this beautiful crosscultural diversity here in the bay area but one thing i discovered when i started teaching here is that american students american students whether or not you're born in america doesn't matter but american students are number one in the world in the most important economic category that nobody talks about and that category is confidence you know with confidence comes the ability to sell sell a dream like like like like tucker does and there's the car version over here yeah um with confidence comes the ability to make something boring that's virtual that you can't see feel or touch like cloud software sound exciting think about it think how boring cloud software is dude it's boring you can't see it it's up there somewhere in the cloud it's elusive whatever but you've got these great entrepreneurs out there that sell it and they make a killing because they come across as confidence when they're delivering so confidence leads to at least to competent sometimes too not over being overconfident and of course i know that talking about the american angle some people overseas might think that's arrogance it's it's that's not what i'm getting at it's not like i've got to do a joke now here we go this is awful kids my american students are going to hate me but i'm american now so i'm allowed to do this how does an american screw in a light bulb oh my god i'm going to regret saying this i'm just one dumb comment away from just everybody hating me well here in america me as an american i hold a light bulb and the whole world spins around me okay i'm totally i'm totally kidding oh my god i've alienated my students i'm totally i love all of you okay i'm joking joking okay how does a a a dumb canadian me screwing a light bulb i hold it up there you go okay we're good now we're good but confidence uh it can be borderline arrogant sometimes you got to keep your confidence in check or just remember your humble roots and like steve jobs said you know stay foolish stay humble i i should i have to i should probably edit that out but f and i'm not going to sorry matt matt my editor he's american i love you matt you know i love you right your family familia yeah so um but no i i i do think a lot of american whether or not they were born in this country okay american students um see american students that were born overseas they also think they can hold a light bulb up okay but american students are number one in the world the most important economic category which is confidence which which lets you sell because a great entrepreneur great ceo etc they're great sales people i'm gonna shut the hell up but now about this one but nobody's smart in you remember that all right so we are now done uh with with section number four uh and so now it's time for the exercise so go to your workbook um and then just um and you can even click in the in the footer here go to section four does this work there we go yeah that's someone's gonna double click it yeah uh and and i had a blast making this bit this visual here man that was fun um but but what i want you to do is just go through all the lessons here in um in section four and you can read that text later if you want to and just write down you know spend three minutes and write down how how what can you apply in the lessons here in section four to to enhance your career you've got three minutes now go so do do all right moving on to section number five uh this is all about uh ethics crucial ethics lessons to keep you out of trouble okay so the first one is number 25 which is transparency builds trust i really believe this you can lose your reputation really quickly in business and in life but if you're fully transparent uh then this will this will help your career a lot uh and what i mean by that is you always list the risks with with like remember we look through the uh the s ones for facebook goldman et cetera whatever and and there's a lot of risks you gotta be transparent and list all the risks and whenever you're selling something to somebody else you gotta tell yourself i feel comfortable selling this to my parents because i would tell my parents the risks as well so you gotta disclose all risk and that that is abraham lincoln right there honest abe uh and he was very very transparent as well and apparently a very good man yeah so that's that's honest honest abe uh or as wayne and garth and wayne's world referred him as babraham lincoln i don't know what that means but anyway uh transparency builds trust remember that always disclose risks um and the most important risk within the first within the first couple minutes of pitching any idea uh or or uh product or service or whatever it is or if you're trying to raise money because it'll make you come across as being you know more ethical too and you know what dude it might be a litigation issue if you don't disclose them uh and never sell a financial product or raise money without getting a lawyer to write your documents first because the lawyer will make sure that you're you know the risks are disclosed yeah transparency builds trust all right next up is don't trust this type of person here so what am i talking about here well well this type of person is the type of person that backstabs other people and if at work or at school or whatever somebody is gossiping and we all will enjoy gossip for whatever stupid reason right otherwise don't watch tmz um i'm a lawyer i don't know if you guys watch the show but whatever uh but but don't don't trust anybody that that gossips because and don't take part in yourself uh because like around the water fountain or water cooler at work whatever because those people that are gossiping about others they'll gospel at you as well they will and the worst type of person is the person that cheats on their spouse it's a sacred bond man you know if they cheat on their spouse of course they're gonna cheat you cheat you in business as well you can't trust them it's like somebody that backstabs their spouse to you of course you're going to backstab you about you to somebody else you can't trust these people you can't trust them so just just be careful just be careful there's a shadow yeah all right so just don't trust that type of person and don't get involved in gossip either uh and on wall street you know if if somebody i knew somebody got fired years ago because he told a client what one of his other clients which is fidelity big mutual fund what they own or what they said in the meeting whatever um and so that that client might be grateful at first they heard that information but they don't trust you it's just it's not worth it it's not worth it yeah yeah yeah and sir richard branson and he's he's he's a he's amazing and i've listened to his all his audio books on audible um he just oozes positivity and he sets the corporate culture for the virgin companies which is why um if you fly virgin atlantic or virgin america all the uh the people that work on the airline the pilots et cetera the they're the attendants they're they're all really really positive and upbeat um you know unfortunately alaska airlines bought uh virgin america recently so maybe the culture will get you know diluted whatever but but i i mentioned sir richard branson because his parents if he ever backstabbed anybody when he was a kid they would make him stand up and look in the mirror and they would say look at yourself don't be that person don't be that person that backstabs others and little quick little side note off topic i have a guy i used to work for or work with i should say years ago he's so well spoken and i got and i met his parents at some events uh and and and i asked uh i asked his parents i said you know mike mike is so well spoken he's a gentleman he's confident how did he become that way and in you know how did you raise him and my kids were younger there so i was asking and they said well you know we one thing we did was we would make him stand up and read to us and when he was reading to us we we made sure he projected his voice and he was comfortable you know thinking on his feet and and standing and reading uh because we we got him to do it so we didn't just make him read in his room and my mom made me mom and dad during the summers when i was a kid they make me read for one hour every day every day in the summers which helped me out tremendously and i do with my kids now too except i add a sweetener i say if you read within the first hour of being awake you can read you got to do it for 45 minutes or if it's later on the day it's like an hour so i incentivize them you know yeah readers are leaders yeah yeah and actually also this guy mike the way that he learned how to public speak was i've never tried this but they would make him put a pencil in his mouth and then speak and then that would try to speak clearly that way so yeah all right moving on next up number 27 how to tell if somebody is lying that's pinocchio there right um does that mean i'm a liar because i got a big nose no it's aerodynamic though it is like dude when i'm skiing because of this like like when i tuck like i go fast like try to beat me in a bike race you can't because this is the aerodynamic side of it but i'm not a liar i'm not pinocchio i just have a very very aerodynamic nose okay all right if i can't laugh myself who can i laugh at that reminds me of a sting song an english man in new york which i love off of sting's album the dream of the blue turtles and sting said it takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile be yourself no matter what they say i love it so how do you tell if somebody's lying and i covered this before i think so i'm going to go into this really really quickly so when i worked at a great big hedge fund um and uh it was called citadel uh and uh ken griffin nice guy um he's the the founder billionaire he actually just bought the biggest house or the most expensive house in american history uh and i remember whenever i meet with him i spent an hour and a half with him or an hour actually a half hour with him one day in his office and we talked about video games for for ages and i looked at his bookshelf and whenever i used to go into somebody's office that's really successful more successful than me which is all the time i would look at what books they have and i'd order them immediately and the book that that ken had actually ken griffin was a damadorian book on finance which i bought and i i have now but when i was at citadel upper management uh they sent um they sent 25year fbi and cia veterans uh to train us on how to tell somebody's lying so now i know how to lie now i'm scared but this really helped us a lot because at that time it was like oh five i think there was a lot of there are a lot of scandals on wall street ceos were lying and there was a joke on wall street which is how do you know if a ceo is lying when they move their lips but but they trained us on how to tell somebody's lying and it helped me a lot actually then while i was investing and now today a lot i can tell usually so the four criteria is false and you one data point is mega trend you usually need two three or four of these to be correct or at least two of them right at least two uh and everybody's a little different so there are exceptions so number one if somebody breaks eye contact uh when they're talking about something that means they're they're probably lying however i break eye contact a lot like i look down a lot it's just i've always been like that i look down sometimes right um maybe i come across as not being confident i don't know just what i do um but if somebody breaks eye contact when answering a question then they might be lying yeah and sometimes when people blink a lot they might be lying and dude i see it on tv all the time i see people lying on tv all the time especially athletes when they're asked are they going to come back to the team next year and do they want to come back they break eye contact sometimes they they ramble um but you'll notice it you'll notice it and watch when somebody is being um being interviewed on television just watch how they answer questions you know if if they look away only the only time they look away a lot is when they're answering a question about something they're lying about that might be a lie all right so number one is they they break eye contact number two is if somebody rambles on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on kind of like i am right now to a simple yes or no question you know it's like a kid you ask a kid did you did you did you did you take the last cookie from the cookie jar no i didn't take a last quarter i mean i can't even reach it i mean look how tall it's it's high up there and then i don't know where the ladder is it's over there but you know what i mean with steps tool i can't find it's right there by the way but i yeah so there's that so we talked about um breaking eye contact we talked about rambling uh another one is if if somebody is shaking their foot and you can look down and see it sometimes when they're lying um and and sometimes because they've had too much caffeine which obviously means they get a hall pass but if somebody's shaking their foot a lot whatever when they're answering a question they could be lying and that's what a lie detector test does remember remember ben stiller and robert de niro and meet the parents right so that's anyway that's what they were testing he was cia i think in that movie yeah and there's there's one more oh yeah yeah touching your face touching your face yeah so uh if if if you touch your face a lot especially cover your mouth um and you usually don't do that but you do that when you're answering a question you might be lying so don't don't accept just one of those four criteria as being gospel that somebody's lying but multiple two or more of them could mean somebody is lying and speaking of touching your face and going off script again here of course given the health crisis we've all got these things um but what i do with my uh my kids and myself now is like and i went to my doctor years ago actually and i asked her i said why are you not sick all the time and she says because i wash my hands a lot and i never touch my face and so for me i've been biting my nails dude since i was born i i just i i do it it's it's terrible and my kids do it as well because monkey see monkey do you know whatever so what i did was i bought this stuff here it's called pro bell and um given the virus scare right now i put this on my nails and i put on my kid's nails as well and it tastes awful right it's not doesn't hurt yet but it just tastes awful but anyway a little off topic but interesting nonetheless so that's how you can tell if somebody is lying yeah all right next up is how to destroy your career in 30 seconds or less if you send an email or a text or or a snapchat and those are forever and you didn't think two or three times about it before clicking the send button you're done you're done just just be careful just be careful and i always know that emails are for life and everything i say on the phone is for life as well you know when i worked on wall street they used to say um just understand that all your calls could be recorded by the government the fbi whatever i was like that's fine i'm never going to do anything unethical anyway but that's you got to do that and sometimes they'll say this call is being recorded for for quality assurances or whatever or if you hear a beep in the background you're being recorded and they tell you to and it's totally bogus like when customer service calls you or you call them to get help and they're recording the call really like try it with them yeah can you help me oh by the way i'm recording this call what is that so a little off topic but just be really careful with electronic stuff email voicemail voice every it's all it's all recorded man you know the privacy died a decade or two ago you know once we realized there's a death of distance in privacy because the internet okay next up oh we're done here okay we're now done uh with with with section number five okay so go to uh section five in your book uh and and take three minutes uh to to to go through as we've done before take take three minutes to go through all the uh all these boxes here and just type in comments or notes or whatever it's optional of course on on on stuff you've learned here or stuff you can apply to to enhance your your career so you got three minutes go let's move on to section number six now so section number six is every battle is won before it's been fought it's a famous quote from sun tzu and the art of war and at the top there i wrote crucial battle preparation lessons and i've used that quote before from sun tzu so i'll go through this quickly all right so number one the first thing to talk about in section number six is over prepare for everything if you over prepare for something like really over prepare you actually will enjoy it when you're actually doing what you prepared for so like when you over prepare for a speech which i've i've done many many times before i get to the speech and i'm so ready i just kind of enjoy it man i can't explain it it's like this is out there but you remember when you were younger and you studied really hard for a math test like really really hard and your friends asked you for help and and you gave them help as well and you know when one teaches to learn but you you you studied a lot for it and then when you get into the exam it's so easy that you actually enjoy it you know you're you're comfortable you're confident you double check your work as always of course um but you enjoy it you know the exam is your friend you enjoy it because you over prepared and what i do also is when i give a speech quite often i bring two laptops and what i used to do is i would bring my laptop with powerpoint on whatever years ago and i would be i would bring uh those overhead slide things as well just in case just in case it broke down and when management at goldman sachs saw me do that like oh my gosh that's amazing i have confidence in this kit and when i give a speech at my brother's wedding back in 04 i did the same thing i had backups just in case just in case yeah so over prepare for for everything please and you know whenever when i used to interview other companies i prepare more than anybody like i recorded myself answering over 100 questions i video recorded myself too did i sound too monotone did i sound too arrogant did i pause enough did i use frameworks to tie together my logic when i was lost in terms of moving on to the bottom line is and so if you over prepare for everything then you'll actually enjoy the event when it occurs because quite often life all comes down to a few short moments the crucial speech or a test or whatever it is so over prepare you know like i i i know that i work harder than anybody and i think it's because when i was younger they they thought i had a learning disability and they want to fail me in the sixth grade in the eighth grade and screw them whatever not my my not my parents my teachers uh and so i i kind of grew up insecure and i over prepared for everything and i'm so grateful to god that they kind of misdiagnosed me or whatever it was they tried to destroy my confidence i'm grateful to god it happened because i over prepare for everything now because of it and there's a great book by malcolm globwell called um david and goliath and it's about how people that have been told their whole lives that they're not good enough are the ones that ultimately do stuff that's important so if if people have told you your whole life or when you were younger and if your confidence is lower than it should be just be grateful that whatever happens within reason obviously whatever happened happened because your secret weapon is you're going to work your ass off work harder than anybody else and i've always worked harder than anybody and i keep pushing the goal post out and challenging myself and i think a lot of it stems to you know it's it's it's nurture and nature you know and you look at your kids why are they successful or not or whatever who cares i mean success should be what they think of themselves right you want to raise confidence kids but you you know somebody is reaches their full potential in life because of nurture or nature so for for me part of it is nature it's part of everybody but it's nurture always you know being told when i was younger you can't do it you can't do you can't do it or elon musk poor guy in south africa he got the crap kicked out of him a lot growing up or steven spielberg you know been you know being diagnosed with with um with with uh i think it was a dyslexia i can't remember yeah um and and he didn't get into usc film school he didn't get in which is the best film school so chip on his shoulder which is great just great i'm sure i'm sure there's more to it than that but but sometimes i feel like if i hire people from from harvard business school they're going to be entitled as hell and a lot of times like i'll i'll lecture at a lot of schools and there's one in particular in the bay area that i hate lecturing at now because there is insane entitlement and arrogance from a lot of the students i'm not going to name that school but my favorite school in the bay area is san francisco state i love those kids of death love no death i've hired them i'll continue to hire them they're the best a lot of them are wealthy but a lot are not and a lot are not entitled the worst thing possible is hiring somebody that's entitled you know it's like like they start and they're like i don't have to sweep the floor it's like oh here's a broom let me teach you over prepare for everything all right i love hiring people that are poor smart and hungry number 30 is the ohair test pass it and watch your career take off so the o'hare test is the chicago o'hare airport is a big airport that's one of the biggest ones and quite and i've spent a lot of time there like eight hours waiting in between flights and quite often with somebody else at work you know someone more senior than me whatever and did they enjoy my company and vice versa in that eight hour layover the o hair test it's important relationships are more important than product knowledge let me move on all right oh i got this one from my dad my dad said chichi never take a short that's my nickname growing up chichi never take a shortcut you've never taken before when you're in a hurry i completely believe that and you've all been through that too i know every single one of you have you're late for something you're driving whatever you're like oh i got to cut a corner you know i got let me take a shortcut i've never taken before and you're even later than if you've gone the regular routes there's no shortcuts in life so i think that's important to keep in mind all right so we are now done uh with section number six okay and so as always we're going to do next is we're going to do an exercise go to the cover page here if you want and click on number six or you can do it up here i always love to have multiple ways to access stuff and spend three minutes uh writing down notes here uh in in all the lessons uh for uh for section six on using the stuff you've learned this lesson to help to enhance your career so you got three minutes to do this go do do so moving on to section number seven you can hear me using my transition words here okay so uh goal setting okay follow these crucial steps and achieve your dreams and see if you guys can tell me what trophy that's from trying to be global here okay so the first lesson here that's number 32 is run to your fears whatever you're most scared of in life i want you to run to those fears because i promise you your competition is probably just as scared they just don't say it so whatever you're most fearful of in business or in life in general run towards it if you're scared of accounting condition yourself to enjoy it learn it better in your competition have fun with it too and always question why things are called what they're called like we talked before about understanding math like we we talked about the the banana i ain't falling for no banana the tailpipe we talked about the banana on the denominator we talked about the balance sheet it's got a balance so just understand stuff and condition yourself to understand stuff and enjoy stuff that you're fearful of meaning accounting or whatever it is if it scares you it scares your competition just as much i promise you so understand it and condition yourself to enjoy it maybe i don't know maybe like when you're learning accounting wherever it is get yourself a nice cup of coffee and listen nice classical music in the backgrounds um you know and if you're having uh problems doing that then remember when you're younger and you went to the library you remember the exact table you sat at deep in the stacks downstairs in that corner and you had your your music on and coffee go back there recreate that environment okay so run to your fears brenda your fears and i put a shark tank there on purpose uh and and if you're absolutely terrified of sharks why not try that and i found this picture here i actually got on adobe i i subscribe to a service where i get images so um there's actually it's actually a cage you can do with a bunch of others right so um a little bit scary for me but i want to get the point across and never have you forget it run to your fears if you're scared of public speaking put yourself out there man move to open spaces make yourself do it run to your fears conquer your fear because you'll never reach your full potential in life unless you conquer your fears all right next up is uh make a gap analysis and so i i love this analogy here um of of the mountain so if your goal is to accomplish something so big and we'll just say it's the top of the mountain then i want you to visualize success and just think about what do you need to do to fill that gap between where you are now and the top of the mountain okay so make a very basic gap analysis as part of your goalsetting strategy okay now lesson number 34 is yale university's fascinating goal setting study okay and some people say this is an urban legend or myth i don't care i want to talk about it anyway so in 1950 yale university which is in the northeast of the united states yale university what they did in 1950 was they asked their their graduating class how many of you have written down your goals and three percent said i have written down my goals then 20 years later they went back to the same graduating class in 1970 and they calculated the net worth of everybody that graduated 1950 20 years later and the net worth of the three percent that had written down their goals was greater than the other 97 combined it's pretty amazing pretty amazing so don't forget to write down your goals and i used to carry my goals everywhere with me they're now on my my iphone in my calendar they repeat daily but what i used to do was i would print out i would buy those remember those those business cards you can make yourself you put in your printer and you pop them out and they look awful whatever i would get those and then i would use powerpoint i remember and just kind of write down type my goals on the back in front of 10 cards and carry them around with me everywhere and when i was down and out i'd read through them and i'm humbled to say i've accomplished pretty much every goal um one of the exceptions is uh not getting a black belt in karate but i'm a mean yellow belt yeah all right uh next up is number 35 should you get a graduate degree so you go to university um i i would say that if you network a lot and you still can't get that career change like if you set up literally a hundred networking meetings i found this that's i don't know that's siri talking again sorry put her aside it's a daily event right so uh if you set up a hundred networking meetings and you still can't change careers then consider getting your graduate degree that's what i would say that's what i would say yeah uh and you might say chris 100 is a little extreme well dude getting a graduate degree at university it can cost a hundred grand including lost wages etc 100 grand so that means that a thousand or 100 meetings that's like a thousand dollars each meeting i'm saving you so again do a hundred meetings i know it sounds like a lot and when i say 100 it probably means you'll do 30. and you'll still get what you want because you did 30. like james cameron said set your goals so high that if you fail you still fail above everyone else's expectations it's kind of like we did cryptocurrency stuff i didn't really expect you guys to do all 49 steps but if you do a lot of them that's that's better than just one or two or not right okay and what you can also do is if you try your best to network to make that career change and you can't then um go to linkedin and find people that have done it and look at their blueprints do they have graduate degrees what have they done to get there but i guarantee you i almost guarantee you if you network like crazy you can you get pretty much where you want in life obviously there's exceptions if you want to be a doctor you know you have to go to medical school although i'm on the board of a charity i'm really proud of called doctors without diplomas yeah that's not true yeah okay number number 36 i love this one push the goal post out um once you achieve your goals what you got to do is you got to you gotta you gotta push the goal post out you you gotta set new goals always because sometimes when you achieve your goals you get a little bit depressed i know it's weird like at first you're like hey i did it you're like dude now what got to keep pushing the goal post out keep challenging yourself uh and if you get a chance i want you to please go and do a search on matthew mcconaughey's best oscar speech from things 2014 or maybe a little bit before that i don't remember but he talks about competing with himself and challenging himself and it was amazing oscar speech i love it to death because he was so real he didn't give a damn what people thought about him he was talking to his dad up in heaven and he was saying dad i love you i know you're up there in your underpants probably with lemon pie with a can of miller light and you're dancing he didn't care then he talked about challenging himself so watch that that speech if you get a chance it's pretty powerful that's right from his heart you know and as maya angelou said people might not remember what you said but they'll never forget the way you made them feel i really believe that and when i get my explain you how to give a great speech um which you have to learn thoroughly um if you're gonna write a business plan because when you write a business plan and you present it to potential investors you got to inspire them as well and i'm going to teach you you know how to give a presentation um like uh like matthew mcconaughey did and i think he got the award for dallas buyer's club or some movie back then yet all right so we are now done with section number seven which is which is goal setting so as always i want you to please go to your workbook and then i want you to go to section seven and then spend um it's working sometimes that's double click yeah uh and then just spend uh spend three minutes uh going through um all the lessons here and document how you can apply some of the stuff you've learned to enhance your career and what you can always do of course is is for homework if you want it's all optional is you can read through the chapters here and so i provide you this is half the book today and next class i'll provide you with the other half of the book in next classes uh workbook as well and i thought about giving you the actual book and i said no way man i want it this way so you you at least have the option to write down notes because one little note you take in these boxes can change your life yeah you can have a breakthrough personal breakthrough yeah all right so take uh three minutes to do that now go do moving on to section number eight this is a great one so section number eight is simply called happiness is and i want to spell that happy ness there's a famous movie where they spell happiness with a y what movie was that you should have all seen it by now if not rent it's got my favorite actor in it ever will smith yeah uh and and if you didn't you're probably younger than me i'm an old man but if you didn't watch the fresh prince of belair ever watch it on netflix or online it's great and we'll we'll suppose the best i love that guy he's so inspirational too he's amazing he's amazing so um section number eight i wrote the top there it's crucial that you find an occupation you love and you'll never work a day in your life of course that's of course that's a very famous quote from confucius all right number 37 here is don't have a job instead have a passion and be happy and achieve all your business goals and if you get up in the morning and you tell yourself i'm going to work with all due respect you're doing it wrong you you got to find your your your purpose your passion you know what was the reason that that you were put on this earth so so find your passion and once you do as confucius said you'll never work a day for the rest of your life and it's like having a new baby you know when you have your first baby some of you might know you unlock a level of happiness you never thought you could feel in your life well when you get up every day and do what you love doing it's the same feelings that not as good but a little bit you know a little bit of that uh lightning in a bottle you feel it feel it inside here um that's that's that's pure happiness pure joy pure adrenaline uh pure euphoria when you do what you love doing and it might take you a while you know sometimes it might take to your 60s figure it out took me to my 40s and i'm 73 now so um yeah all right moving on number uh oh guys laugh your failures watch this video dude that i love the internet was made just for that i love that video it's hysterical and whenever you think about your failures i want to condition you to laugh at your failures you'll find humor in it you know to a certain extent um yeah anyway so i i i look at my failures in life and i laugh at them they're fun they're funny i don't know so condition yourself to kind of laugh your failures and you won't take life too seriously you'll live longer you'll be happier and you'll be willing to fail again so you can laugh again all right next up is uh money does not equal uh happiness yeah so i i i had a trip to um mumbai uh business trip years ago i think it was halt international school of business wanted me to give a speech or a couple speeches so i did it there in up in delhi as well and that trip changed me man it changed me because when we drove from the airport to the four seasons in mumbai whatever and mumbai's there's 25 million people tons of rich people there but there's also a large number of people that that live in the slums and we were stuck in traffic thank god because it was right by the slums and i've never seen so many people with nothing so happy they were so happy it's kind of like when um i remember matthew my youngest kid we used to go to the park on sundays and there was always a large group of people from immigrants and they would sit on they had nothing like we had a nice blanket to sit on they had cardboard boxes and they would barbecue and there was tons of them together in a family you know a bond of love and my son matthew he was like four of them he said daddy why why do they always seem so much happier than everybody else they got nothing to lose you know you want to buy experiences not things and then you go to an expensive restaurant look around dude when you go to expensive restaurant look around you see all these arrogant people whatever and i like going at good restaurants whatever but they're not as happy as when you go to a park you know it's sometimes i feel like like david geffen he's a billionaire and no high school degree started in the mail room and he uh he started guffing records he signed guns or roses and other bands whatever um and then he's one third of dreamworks as well along with katzenbergen and spielberg but but david geffen said for those of you that think that money can buy you happiness you don't have money it's it does not buy happiness at all i promise you and and i remember uh when i worked at goldman every christmas you get you got a bonus everyone was so damn depressed every christmas because the cancer of wall street and western society is you always compare yourselves to those that have more you know when you look into the bowl of your neighbor you shouldn't look to see if you have more you you should look to see if if he or she has enough or at least as much as you do yeah so money no matter what you think does not buy happiness of course we need to make a certain amount to live but don't make money your god you know it's it's one of the ten commandments not to do something like that so um yeah so anyway and there's there's a great british airways commercial that that i want to share with you soon um that was filmed in new york in india that really touched my heart and really makes you focus on family and what real happiness is my name is ratnesh i'm originally from mumbai i mean i like to call it bombay because i grew up there what do i remember from bombay well playing in the streets taking the local jasmine gajra's in the flower market and my mother praying in the morning you can move thousands of miles away but these images they are always with you i am alka my full name is i am 61 years old my son is ratnesh he's staying in new york first when he told me he wanted to go to the u.s i felt very excited but when the moment came when he was leaving india that time i was really very nervous and quite heartbroken i must say today british airways has given me a seat on a plane it is for my son's favorite dish okra paratha they will fly to america and surprise him in his apartment i think this will make him come home and visit his mummy i like every mother does i used to experiment with different things putting in his different box most of the time the other vegetables they will return from the school untouched but whenever i am giving okra it is finished i asked him why you like okra the most he said mama my teacher has told the child who eats okra becomes best in his mathematics my son is progressing day by day his dreams are getting fulfilled and his happiness is more than what i ever want for him when he will look at the tiffin box first he will think from where has it come but once he tastes the food he will know it is made by his mummy and i am sure he will start searching for me in his apartment i miss him so much because when he left home he was hardly 17 years old and from that day he did not return home i miss myself my mom had cooked my favorite meal and she was waiting for someone from british areas to pick up the different carrier so they sent me after flying from new york to mumbai there i was walking to her door smelling her cooking it was an incredible feeling sometimes even when you know what's going to happen you cannot even imagine how it's going to be i got the opportunity to see my mother in a way had never seen her before she looked lonely she looked like she sounds over the phone i just wanted to run out and give her a hug mommy i'm here oh it was a great moment it was a family moment even his dad was there we are three of us sad we talked and i didn't ask him when are you leaving i said i will not ask you today let this question be for tomorrow what a great commercial man um just appreciate what you have that's what happiness is not hoping to get something later that will make you happier thingwise but happiness is just appreciating what you have that's what it is and i believe that if you're happy and if this works this will work much much better you'll come full circle okay next up is all your wealth can't buy you health it's so true um and that that's a quote i think from i think i got it from bob dylan yeah all your wealth can't buy your health uh and there's a great book by the the dalai lama that i mentioned before i read it on my honeymoon and when i was in indonesia which is a great setting and read his book if you haven't yet but but he says basically that the problem with western society is we sacrifice our health our entire lives in order to make money then at the end of our lives we sacrifice all of our money to maintain our health and then we look back and we realize we never really lived to begin with so treasure every single day every day smell the roses along the way i used to tell myself years ago when i was in my 20s i was like i don't get married have kids until i make my fortune in my empire dude what's the point start a family now enjoy life today don't live for tomorrow live for today number 42 is when to change careers and i hate to end this on a down note but i have to in order to make a big impact like i mentioned before if you get out of bed in the morning and you're not happy and you feel some sort of depression related to your job channel that frustration and that unhappiness network like crazy channel that frustration and find something you love doing you know don't only focus on money i get it we have to pay bills i get it but enough's enough dude like at some point you got to realize that what am i here for why don't i laugh as much as i used to when i was younger why am i working in a big company i'm not being myself when i was younger i used to laugh so hard until i fell down with my buddies and it hurt in a good way why am i not laughing anymore why am i not being myself why do i get up every day and go to a job i can't stand working for people i don't respect and i don't respect myself as much anymore because i'm not being myself either i'm being political at work i'm not being me i just want to be me so if you're depressed and if you don't see work as something you enjoy don't do it you know don't try to live somebody else's life or or or be a prisoner in someone else's mind and do stuff to make them happy like if people in your life want you to be a lawyer or doctor whatever it is and you're not passionate about wanting to be a lawyer meaning you don't want to be a liar and you're not passionate about being a doctor because you want to be around blood and stuff if that's not i mean it's great to help people and i respect you know all doctors and um civil rights lawyers only but you got to do it what drives you makes you happy because i really do believe that if you if you do something you love doing in life you find the why of your life then you'll not only be good at it but the money will come accidentally you won't i mean i i go to a basketball game or a football game or whatever and all these dudes on the field they don't get up in the morning and say oh god i gotta go play a game today that's not work man that's awesome same thing with rock and roll star you know they don't get up in the morning oh god i gotta play another gig today it's a beautiful thing to be an artist because you get to express yourself which is why also like i think of what i do and what we all do as as being art you know the the palette for us is a powerpoint document or an excel spreadsheet that we can we can jazz up with cool buttons and colors and fun stuff it's artistic and it's fun for me and for you as well but you got to do something you love doing in life and you got to take risks as well and start your own companies on the side and in semesters three and four we'll you'll you'll write a kickass business plan and i'll help you kind of define what it might look like in the future for you but the worst thing can happen to you is you're you wake up one day and you're way older than you are now and you're working for this jerk that pays you this much money to make their dreams become a reality you got to take chance to take risks if you're not happy doing what you're doing either change your line of work by networking a lot or do a ton of side hustles on the side until you find something you're passionate about you know and that's kind of what i did too i i was working venture capital i wasn't happy i loved teaching and my side hustle was was teaching and then also putting stuff online like this um i didn't do it for the money i did it because i wanted to help like i want to help those those kids at the limo foundation that was fun for me helping it gave me a sense of purpose my why as well so if you get up in the morning and you tell yourself you're going to work then you got to find a different career path and start networking a lot to meet with people that work in different industries or just figure out what is the reason you're putting on this earth what makes you happy you want

workbook open as you can see on the screen here in either pdf format word format or google docs format very important you have at least one of these open today or one of them because there's going to be a lot of exercises kind of like what we did last class and so we're going to do the second half of the this book here today it's going to be plenty of exercises now you're probably thinking chris what is going on why do you have this thing up here uh well i want to do something a little bit different today before we we jumped right in on it um when i was a kid i remember laughing so hard until it hurt and with my friends you know what i'm talking about like yeah sometimes you're rolling on the ground laughing so hard and then what happens is you i don't know you kind of grow up and you you stop laughing as much and you start working for other people and you're just not yourself anymore and and this really hit home for me because this here is um this is a a chair from uh exhibition stadium uh which is a a great stadium that no longer exists in toronto and it was for the the blue jays actually the toronto blue jays my baseball team i'm so passionate about sports and you can see i've got a big ticket up there as well for the first game in 1977. tickets were really really big back then but now people are environmentally environmentally friendly dad here we know i promise but the one thing that my dad my brother my family and i my sisters my mom and we all have in common is a love of baseball and love of sports uh love of the toronto blue jays uh i'm feeling homesick just thinking about it uh and so i bought this uh it wasn't that expensive it's it's it's old it's rusty as you can tell i bought this on on ebay and get anything on ebay and it reminds me of the great times i had with my dad my my my family going to to games growing up and you know when i was a kid i didn't i didn't realize that baseball was a business or sports was a business and that's why it meant like i still love sports i still love baseball and the blue jays especially but um it meant a lot more to me when i was younger yeah and i just want to cherish these memories and you know sometimes when i um when i'm not in the best of moods or i'm kind of upset or depressed a bit which happens um i i think about when i was younger and when i laughed really hard until it hurt give me one second i want to get something here i got a got a couple these props here um this is a canadian money this is real canadian money what we use there that's i don't know why i picked that up sorry i got a couple baseball cards um and these meant the world to me when i was a kid these are rookie cards for a couple of great troll blue jays players whatever but this here this here means a lot to me and what happened and my kids like they have a love of baseball as well um and i want you all to think about one point in your life when you were so euphoric so happy and i want you to meditate about that really think about it and i want that to be your trigger for if you ever aren't in the best moods you're not if you're not in the peak peak mental state if you're not yourself if you're not happy i want you to remember when you were younger maybe you were family at a game or something bonding with your dad your mom your brother sister whatever your your spouse uh and that should put you back in that peak mental state we all have one or two incidents in our life that we all remember that put us in that peak mental state um and i wasn't even planning on talking about this but i'm gonna wing it this is um well okay so this here um and if you can't see it properly um then matt what i want you to do is match my editor he's awesome get the 2016 tops jose batista card uh number eight and and this here was um a game number of years ago uh and my three boys and i'll show you what my kids look like actually um so these are my my three boys this is um andrew um dylan a little munchkin uh and he's usually not that quiet and matthew and they're so different they're like sons to me i love them to death but i i bring this up because what happened was we were watching a baseball game it was 2015. it was one of the happiest moments of my life after i got married and all that good stuff in case christine's watching yeah but we were watching the game here it was in this house and we're upstairs and we were losing the game to the texas rangers another baseball team and this guy named jose batista and this is a a picture of of what happened he hit the most epic home run and it was a come from behind victory and then he flipped his bat and we all like my three boys and me they have a little brother me we all jumped up and down up and down up and down and we're yelling top of our lungs we were so happy and they were jumping into my arms and all that stuff and i was i was euphoric i was happy and whenever i'm not in the best moods i i think of this situation here and by the way this this baseball that he hits to win that game uh i bid on it in an auction i gotta open it right at the end killed me but whatever it is what is um but this is what i think of this moment right here and so um and maybe this camera has got a better angle i'm not sure with the lighting and stuff uh but but that's yeah this is uh this means the world to me you know my boys obviously my family and christine like my parents everybody and when i'm not in the best of moods uh what i do is um and give me one second put this back here make sure there's no glare i don't think there is whoop okay good glare scott nice when i'm running out of the best of moods i i think of this this event and it gets me back into peak mental state you know um you can snap out of a crappy mood by thinking of a trigger point in your life at one point in your life when you were you were so euphoric so happy um and you know just because you're older now doesn't mean you can't love the same things that you loved when you were a lot younger like you like video games f it play video games you know you love sports just don't think of it like it's a business just remember the times you bonded with family and friends over great sporting events and if you can if you get a chance you know if they tear down your stadium that you used to go to whether it's a i don't know cricket stadium rugby baseball australian rules football or whatever it is see if you can buy that that seat yeah so anyway um think about a trigger point if you can't in your life to get you in that peak mental state if you ever need uh a pickmeup okay what i'll do now is i'll go into highspeed and and i'll get this old rustic uh piece of not junk out of the way all right let's do this let's do this this will be a fun class so again this is uh e13 unjustified criticism is nothing more than a disguised compliment so bring it on doubters and i'm gonna have a bunch of brand new quotes that you're gonna enjoy i hope you enjoy them uh and so if if somebody says something that that dislodges you or gets you out of your peak mental state um and it's so unjustified i want you do one of two things the first thing i want you to do is i want you to tell yourself they're probably very envious for whatever reason you know and that criticism i don't choose to accept it because it's unjustified but you know what and this is me talking to the jerk that criticized me or whoever it might be in the future and you know who i'm talking about this has all happened to all of us you know what i want to thank that jerk because he is so insecure that he gave me a great compliment thank you bring it on bring it on and if you're not getting criticized you're not successful enough it's gonna happen and i want you to embrace it because unjustified criticism is nothing more than a disguised compliment think about that also think about um that trigger point you have in your life for me it's that jose batista baseball home run thing that uh got my kids and i in insanely great mood i gave him shivers just just thinking about it right now so again we're gonna go through uh just part two of of this book today uh and there's gonna be plenty of exercises as well and there's a reason why i have this stuff here and there's a reason why i have that there as well and i've got things that are really personal to me like i'm opening up in this episode like this is my most prized possession um it was jamaica january of uh of 1980 and and my dad and i um we went for a walk on the beach in jamaica and i was uh i was seven at the time and i remember really well and there was a this was this was dark green when i saw it initially there's tons of bamboo uh that was on the ground uh and somebody cut it up and my dad took it and he got a keychain uh and uh while i was swimming in the pool uh my mom was back in the hotel room because katie my little baby sister wasn't feeling all that but my dad actually carved in here and it says chris jamaica uh january 1980 i've used this as a pen holder whatever i spilled yeah years ago i don't remember when but um this means a lot to me so i'm going to open up today um yeah so anyway we're going to do part two now of this book yeah so again there's 17 sections in the book last class we talked talked about uh sections one through eight um and in this class we're gonna discuss sections um nine through seventeen nine through seventeen yeah all right um so just take notes uh in in today's workbook please on how you can apply every single lesson we talk about as many as you can to help to enhance your life make you happier improve your career prospects help you with goal settings et cetera and so what i did was i made 101 places for you to write down uh these uh in in the workbook so today's workbook we're going through lessons 43 43 through 101 uh and in the last workbook uh we did uh 1 through 42. so if you haven't watched the previous lecture please go back and watch it first okay thank you all right let's talk about section number nine which is called legal stuff is important and so lesson number 43 is how to protect your family it's really really important if you ever start a company or if you're part of a partnership and you have equity in a company that if somebody gives you an employment contract that you hire a lawyer to get them to review it the problem with lawyers is it doesn't matter if you really trust the person you're working for if they give you a contract to sign they probably haven't read it their lawyer made it and their lawyer is obviously biased uh and so i really want you to hire a lawyer on the side to review the legal document please do that please please please um and i've done that before when i've been part of partnerships and it saved my ass it really really did what happened was there was a stipulation in the contract that if one of our companies we invested in venture capital companies got acquired or had an exit or there was a harvesting event meaning it went public or whatever that there was no timeline when i would get paid but i would get paid one day which could have meant 50 million years from now whatever so that that really saved my backside uh and i actually ended up selling all my positions whatever um and also when when when i've had other like i in my hedge fund i had 25 of my hedge fund um i actually had a i sold it to a high net worth investor that was one of my my big backers uh and and i hired a lawyer as well and the lawyer put in some language to just to save my backside like all the people in business i've dealt with they've been ethical i trust them but you gotta you gotta watch out uh and the same thing when it comes to if you start your own company once you start generating some revenue please make sure that you talk to a lawyer i'm going to get down my knees now because i want you i want you to remember this forever can i make a fool of myself laugh at me ouch not with me hurts my knees now when i kneel i'm getting older please please please please i'll look at all three cameras actually please you you and you i want you all to get a lawyer to create documents to register your company when you start it okay when you start it once you start figuring out that this is something you want to do for us your life or you're generating revenue that sort of thing it's really important because when you start getting some success people will come after you they'll sue you it's happened to me having me recently actually uh and and somebody went after me because i've done well in one of my companies uh and um i i was gonna out litigate them i was gonna be a pit bull and a pork chop and finally they dropped the lawsuit which was garbage anyway yeah but thank god i was protected just in case nothing happened to god but you gotta prepare for the worst always always always please please please please um so yeah protect your family protect your family always and if it's kind of a if you're not sure how to do it with your your boss if you're given partnership or whatever in the company and if it's a really really big company as long as you don't have power but um a lot of times you do and when you approach your boss to talk about this or whoever it is partner or whatever just say look i have to i have to be mindful of my family in case i get hit by a bus or whatever i want to make sure taken care of and anybody with half a heart or half a brain will understand and sympathize with you as well okay all right uh next up is um always always always ask a lawyer for help if you're not sure if an investment opportunity is legitimate okay so if you don't get an investor uh offering memorandum or an s1 document or whatever it might be if you can't get access to that or if it looks like it's halfassed and i want you to get your lawyer to look at that first okay or at least seek their counsel and never invest in anything without legal documents anyway like an offering memorandum and we've talked a lot about how to read them how to read the s ones for example so make sure you have access that and don't ever do a big investment yourself without getting your lawyer to review the documents anyway just in case just in case okay so just always be careful and that's one of the very few lawyers i love which is um gandhi i think he's a lawyer right i think so yeah okay all right next up staying out of trouble uh in this digital reality we all know this that everything is recorded everything every email is recorded every snapchat that's right be careful that every snapchat every tick tock or whatever video the video does your platform is every single one is recorded every phone call is well everything so obviously not anything unethical but just be careful just be careful things can be taken out of context always always always in every message that i write in everything i say on every phone call i've always been very careful in case somebody takes it out of context always be careful if you feel like you're being trapped with an email don't respond don't respond be careful everything is recorded and when i worked on wall street every now and then i'd hear a beep in the background and that meant that the call is being recorded by law they had to do that and i know for a fact actually i think i know that a lot of my calls were recorded by the fbi and the sec i never got caught for anything i never did anything wrong but just in case be careful and i was told actually at a couple hedge funds i worked at that just pretend every call is recorded just be careful just be careful it's never worth it cutting corners anyway it's never worth it never worth it there's so many celebrities that have gone to jail for years for something as stupid as a buddy calling said hey i got a stock pick for you okay thanks okay i'll buy it whatever they heard something like martha stewart etc just be careful okay assume everything is documented every every single phone call email etc i know it sounds a little silly for me to go on and on and on about this but i care i care yeah and if a lawsuit ever does occur what's going to happen is lawyers will go through email servers um texts whatever and they'll find they can find something like i believe warren buffett said this if you ever investigate somebody enough you'll find something you'll find something so just be careful yeah all right next up is i want you to please go to your workbook uh and similar to what we did last class open today's workbook and i want you to click on the the number nine on the cover um meaning section nine on the front page click on the number nine there yeah and and if the if it doesn't work for some reason at the top it says section nine you can click on the hyperlink there as well um then i want you to spend three minutes please writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section nine to enhance your career you have three minutes go so do welcome back section number 10 management best practices the most crucial business revelation is that ideas are commodities execution is not it's all about the management team most people don't realize that most people think if i have a solid business model then everybody will invest and things will work out that's not the way the world works so let's go through these so lesson number 46 is you want to praise in public and criticize in private and this is a great way to manage people and i actually got this this idea here from the former ceo of a great software company called splunk splk is the ticker and godfrey sullivan was the former ceo of the company and i also invested in him when he was the ceo of a great software company called hyperion that oracle bought and before that godfrey worked at apple he has a lot of great experience and so i'm trying to impress upon the importance of looking at a great management team first before investing now godfrey said one day to me um you know i asked why are you so successful and people will do that man it's great and that's the crux of my whole book people will do that if you see somebody successful um get more successful than you are right now right now then i want you to approach them and ask them for you know just advice ask them what give me one reason why you're successful and people love talking about themselves look at me i i i won't stop talking i keep talking about myself it's annoying really uh but i'm not successful uh but so yeah i've met with a ton of people that are way more successful ever be and i always ask them for one piece of advice that's not taught in schools and that's why i do what i do right now i'm trying to teach you real practical based stuff uh and not theoretical crap and so godfrey said he likes to praise in public and only criticize in private you know there's nothing worse than being criticized by your boss in front of many of your i don't know fellow workmates um it destroys morale and it makes you makes you hate your job so nobody wins if you're going to critic criticize somebody uh try to do it in private always always always and there's right ways to criticize tim you know um and there's i hate to do this uh but i think i'll talk about it right now um and i'm gonna tell you about how to hire and fire people later but today but when you let somebody go that what you're supposed to do is this and they usually know it's coming you sit down with them and you start off by and usually do it on a monday if you want to ruin their weekend you you start off by saying something very complimentary but sincere and real like everybody on the team really enjoys your company and you did a great job on the project x or whatever it is however due to this this and this i'm so sorry we have to let you go so you always start with with something positive and that's extreme because i'm talking about letting somebody go and i'll give you more information on how to do that very very soon but when you're criticizing somebody uh that you want to keep um you want to start off and be complimentary at first yeah yeah it's more subtle that way and it'll take it better as well yeah all right um next up is be unemotional in business that's that's the incredible hulk there um so and i've mentioned this before that a lot of the best investors i've worked for a lot of billionaires and i won't say which ones ever but some of them it feels like they were borderline aspergers um and they were unemotional and i think that's one of the reasons why they're very successful but you can train yourself to sort of be like that you got to check your emotions at the door and never get too emotional in business and remember warren buffett said the new york stock exchange is the only store in the world where consumers sell stuff and it goes on sale i want you to be unemotional and i'm a very positive person however when things go incredibly well for you i don't want you to highfive and throw a big party et cetera unless it's a massive milestone whatever in business i want you stay levelheaded and you got to stay levelheaded because if the opposite happens you'll freak out check your emotions at the door be unemotional about business always always always uh and you can condition yourself to do that too like when i come home from work i condition myself so that when i touch the front door and start to turn it i leave all my stress and thoughts about work at work inside my house it's a sacred temple my kids christine my kids and i my family but i conditioned myself that way and you can condition yourself as well to check your emotions at the door when you show up to work even so you're not emotional especially when it comes to finance yeah all right next up is the most important investment characteristic which you can probably guess here has to do with horses the jockey me and the dude on top of the horse the jockey is more important than the horse and what that means is the management team or the founder or founders they're more important than the business model the horse is the business model in this analogy okay always remember that always always always and when you assess a management team um make sure that they get you excited about the vision they paint for you so to speak or the dream they're selling to you because the business model will change if it's an early stage company but i want you to be incredibly passionate because the potential investor that's watching you present they're thinking themselves does this person get me excited deep down in my belly about this business opportunity and i know that that business opportunity that the market will probably change one day but i want to know that this this this person that's trying to sell me the idea will be able to sell me on another idea or be able to adapt and get me excited about another business model or whatever it might be or new product they might be offering a new service if i invest if i invest and as mark cuban said ideas are commodities by execution is not and mark cuban is is the dude that he sold um broadcast.com uh to youtube for or pardon me to yahoo for several billion dollars in the late 90s and that could have been youtube actually but it wasn't they messed up the acquisition but mark cuban also said you only have to be right in business one time so just remember that when you keep trying to write different business plans if you fail a couple times so what you will be successful eventually and i don't have to read you that that quote on the wall uh with michael jordan there yeah you get it okay next up we've got um yeah hire slowly and and fire quickly so when you hire somebody the best way to do it is to really over interview um and so like when i worked at goldman sachs like the smartest people in the world didn't work there i mean they hired me but they they hired people that really got along well and we had to go through a gazillion interviews a ton of them like 40 sometimes 40 or 50. it was nuts but the jerk factor is very very low and they took their time thank god because one stupid or one employee with with a bad attitude i should say can destroy an entire company it's true you've all been doing you've done group projects in school or at work where there's one jerk that just destroys everything it's not worth it it's not worth it so when you interview people i want you to make sure that they are interviewed multiple times in different settings under different amounts of pressure and i say with love my heart so interview them maybe at a breakfast meeting uh do a twoonone lunch meeting uh have them present to five or six people in your company if you have that many people um you know go out maybe for dinner with them and their spouse um and see them in all aspects of their life because they can't act the whole time you know if if they're the salty earth they're good people um you'll know you'll know and usually i know within 30 seconds um whether or not i trust them and go with your gut too because you learn by by you know by through business over over many decades that your gut is often right and we've all gotten burned in our personal lives and professional lives too and we end up telling ourselves you know fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me go with your gut go with your gut because a lot of times you're when you get screwed over in business or personally speaking when you're younger remember when you broke your heart the first time it hurt and it never hurt that bad again right you kind of learn you kind of learn um and and in hindsight after you get screwed over in business or personally you tell yourself damn it i knew i knew go with your gut go with your gut but take a long time to hire people and when you're interviewing people make sure that you feel it in your heart that they're not interviewing for a job they're interviewing for a passion okay and they'll be way more productive that way trust me on this the difference between hiring an average engineer and an incredible engineer is 10 times more in performance and a lot of engineers actually they love what they do you know they just they're they're they're nerds they they love they grew up like like i did you know playing video games i was gonna include this i don't know i guess i didn't but this was uh i guess this is the the first um joystick i had for my um this is the apple predecessor that with the apple 2e actually but a lot of a lot of people that are engineers and nice to be a software engineer too we grew up loving it like these are some of the programs that i i you know i developed for microsoft and other stuff too but i loved it man it was fun you know and that's why a lot of technology companies do well because the people are so passionate about what they're doing they just love it so make sure that whoever you're interviewing is just as passionate as you are they've got to love it they've got to absolutely love it otherwise if it feels like a job then you'll you'll never put your dent in the universe as a company all right oh actually let me let me go back here um yeah so higher slowly and fire quickly um let me talk a little bit more about um about firing i i talked about it briefly and i remember the first time i had to fire somebody it was it was hell and obviously it was way harder for the person that i let go and i didn't know what the hell to do and i was nervous and and it sounds stupid for me saying this because it sucks that i'd let the other person go but you have to do it and so what i did was i called um one of my good friends i went to mcgill with a guy named mike ball he was my fraternity too great guy and and i asked him because his dad was the head of hr uh human resources at att or ncr for years and i asked him how do i do it and and he helped me out with some advice and and i took what he told me and a bunch of other top silicon valley entrepreneurs i ask their feedback i always over prepare for everything and here's the greatest it's what i learned when you let somebody go you do it on a monday like i mentioned before you sit down with them and what you do is this a bit repetitive here i'm sorry but i have to do it you start off by saying something genuinely nice and you do it like this john i just want to let you know that we really appreciate the great job you've done on the x project making that up and you know everybody loves you here and you know times are tough but due to the the fact that and then this is where you mentioned what they did wrong that you missed your i'm gonna make it up you missed your quota three quarters in a row we have to let you go then you pause and you say nothing you pause and dude it feels like freaking eternity just waiting sometimes you say nothing and then they'll they'll say something um a lot of times they'll know like they'll kind of they figure it out it's happening you know like when they're they're called into the meeting on a monday they know they know or at least they have a hunch and they probably know it's coming because they haven't been performing as well it's usually not a massive surprise sometimes it is and then you just wait and they might say something rightly so about you know what about my family and that sort of thing and then you you have a file there and you say well we prepared for you uh these these benefits uh and you wanna be very generous of course and if it's a bigger company you'll have somebody from human resources in the room as well and if you don't know what to do and it's a tiny company it's just you and somebody else or a couple people you can always get a lawyer to help you call them and ask them how do i do this you have to do it the right way and then what happens and most of the time people are cool about it but i've been in situations where a colleague of mine was let go and they had to call security and you can always get a security guard uh you can you can hire one or you can get somebody in a bigger company uh to be standing by just outside the room just in case just in case and if they're a bit abrasive uh or you know the person that you let go um you can always say and you could be firm you know if they're being really pushy you could say do i have to call security like that like that so anyway and then what happens usually is they they look at the paperwork quickly and and then they they shake your hand that's it yeah yeah and you got to be careful too because if you let go and it's happened to everybody happen to me um if you're let go if you're not careful and if if you're abrasive or a jerk well first of all you're gonna make it easier for them to let you go but if you're a jerk about it good luck getting another job because that's your reference whoever lets you go is your former boss that's your reference so be good about it like when i was let go i didn't like my boss he put his hand out uh and i didn't shake it i gave him a hug and i hugged him so hard i broke all his ribs no i'm just kidding i'm just kidding it was bogus um i i made the firm money i have no idea what happened but i was strategic um i think he was threatened by me but it is what it is but i'm so glad it happened because in hindsight many many many many years later i look back i'm like thank you god for guiding me down that path a different path sometimes you won't understand in life why things happen and then years later you look back and you'll say you know what as painful as that was professionally for me it was the best thing that could have happened to me because it forced me down this path here so um but just yeah be careful on your way out and and if any of you have left a company and you didn't live on leave on great terms and somebody asked for a reference you don't have to get your old boss as a reference you can always have a former colleague a buddy of yours who can even write a nice recommendation on linkedin so that's just food for thought yeah uh and when you let people go you gotta you gotta let them go fast it's so hard and after you let them go say you wait six months too long after you let them go you're like damn it they hurt productivity i should let them go way way before way way way way earlier it's so hard though man it's i've got a big heart um but at the same time you got to put business first and if it if it ever if your heart gets in the way of business sometimes just think to yourself this is all things to say but i have to you're hurting your family if you don't do it sooner and you're hurting them as well because they're rotting away at work when they could be doing something else they're more passionate about and i know it doesn't make sense to a lot of us right now but many years later you'll look back and you might be glad that you were let go yeah all right okay next up um we've got touch hand only once um i didn't know what icon to use here what graphics so i found like an old file cabinet thing because i got this one from my dad and this is old school device it's great though he said if you ever if you ever write a letter and you're a little bit negative in the letter or mean by accident or whatever it is and if you're emotional don't mail that letter yet take that letter my dad he's he's arabic from egypt he'd say take the letter put it in the drawer and then i can't do his accent well i'm sorry but open it the next day the drawer next morning after you sleep on it and if you still feel the same way after you read it then send it and that's great advice it's great advice because in this digital reality now um you could send an email when you're in a crap mood and destroy your life or hurt your career a lot and what i used to do is i used to have christine who's my wife and my shrink and my wife and my shrink um she um i used to ever read some of my emails i'm like did i sound how's the tone here that sort of thing because things can be really misinterpreted you know like if somebody types in all caps which i never do but it's like they're yelling and usually with almost all my emails since day one i use the word please and thank you and all it's just on my birth thanks something i've always done yeah touch hand only once yeah yeah oh my god i think i screwed that up but screw it let me go back there i meant to say something else there but that was good advice screw it we'll keep that in there it's fine touch hand only once i'm such an idiot it's an old school business thing which is this in the old days you used to get interoffice memos and there's a string on it you unwrap open the envelope and the best business people in the world will say when a memo comes in your hand or an email or whatever it is only let it touch your hand one time and take care of everything right away if you can unless it's something that's gonna take forever to do and i've adopted that actually in many aspects of my life and this is gonna sound out there but it saves me time when i make a salad at night and i love salad with oil and vinegar and salt and pepper and i have this awesome uh bagel spice it's it's it's it's what you put on everything bagels but it's a spice i get it from trader joe's the best ever but i only let all those things touch my hand once so i open the cupboard up once and i take all those out at the same time once you put them all back in at once right i know it sounds silly but if you use that mentality you will save a ton of time a ton of time so touch hand only once okay all right so now i want you to please go to your workbook and click on number 10 meaning section 10 on the front page and then i want you to take three minutes please and write down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 10 to enhance your career or make you happier you've got three minutes go do do all right let's move on now to section number 11 which is called navigating corporate politics and swimming with sharks yeah all right so the first one here is keep that letter in your drawer i i i'm such an idiot i jumped the gun i already talked about this one so i'm just gonna skip it okay but just keep in mind that a lot of times in business you don't get to the next level because of politics which sucks and i'm going to give you some i guess some some tips here on how to um how to swim with the shark so to speak as much as i hate that so religion and politics leave them at home don't ever talk about them in work ever ever ever because the way that politics works usually in most countries there's two parties party one or party two you know or sometimes there's three like in canada there's there's a bunch actually there's progressive conservative which is like right wing relatively speaking you got liberals and then you've got um ndp which i can't stand i mean ndp yeah which is uh they're more socialist yeah yeah sorry about that sort of and in america you've got republicans and democrats and republicans means that you're more rightwing and democrats means that you're less rightwing you're more leftwing and i live here in california on the left coast get myself in trouble there i gotta be careful but if you tell people what your political affiliation is and i think i'm probably a libertarian i believe in the power of the individual and that you can accomplish anything so i'm less so married to these parties although i will swap every now and then okay but if you tell somebody that you're in one part you like one type of politician then half the people will hate you or not like you as much i don't know what half but just be careful it's not worth it so what do you do when politics come up at work well you just don't talk if a bunch of people are around or if somebody tries to bait you into it you can say two words i understand and that won't let them know that you're one with one party or the other party i i understand that will help uh and religion is is is tough it's tough um it's really really hard because i am really passionate about stuff but and i'm i'm very respectful of every religion on the planet but just be careful at class or at uh at um at work getting nervous now yeah yeah just be careful yeah all right next up is um unjustified criticism is a disguised compliment i had to mention this one twice okay and so yeah if somebody criticizes you unfairly you got to tell yourself thanks man like don't say it out loud it'll drive them nuts um don't say it out loud it'll it won't help you but just tell that to yourself and your mind and that will say it is yeah yeah so remember that unjustify and write it down please write it down unjustified criticism is a disguised compliment that will add years to your life it'll take away a lot of stress in your heart and your mind as well yeah all right um what do we have next number number 54. come on slides move faster there we go good all right next one is um how to talk buying people's backs and that's um looks like a nail file but i it's it's actually a butter knife um i didn't want to have a real real knife whatever but the best way is not to do it at all i know it sounds silly and you're like chris seriously like i'm an adult here right i know but don't get tied into that like office gossip like stay away from gossip at the office um like sometimes it's you're around the water cooler and somebody will be gossiping you're like yeah yeah you're interested in hearing it but just don't don't be a part of that people won't trust you and if you gossip even a little bit about somebody at work they'll appreciate hearing it but they won't trust you you know it's like somebody that backstabs their wife or their husband you know says something bad about them um you're like dude i can never trust you so stay away from gossip at work it's not worth it it's not worth it at all yeah all right next up is observe and then make your move so every company has a slightly different corporate culture and every team does and every board does as well so when you join a new company i don't want you to make your move right away and try to really impress people right away hear me out i want you to question things at first like question in your mind and really observe how the system works because every company's a little bit different you know and be nice to the assistants please anybody that isn't is an plus the assistants have been there longer than most people and they probably worked with their boss at the previous company as well and they know how to get stuff done and if you confide in them and get them to mentor you they'll love it they'll trust you you'll trust them and they'll help you with your career yeah yeah you can really you can really understand what kind of a person somebody is or how much jerk they are by how they treat assistance so observe observe how the system works at first before making your move you got one shot to really impress people just sit back a bit don't be lazy but don't talk up too much initially just observe how it works you know quietly observe the system because every com every company is is a little bit different a little bit different yeah all right next up is the army promotes you because of this um so it's so hard sometimes to to deal with authority and not talk back and just do what you're told to do and but sometimes if you if you kind of follow blindly i hate to say sometimes it helps you with your career a lot uh and you might be frustrated but it in the long run it'll it'll pay off because you'll get what you want and if you're frustrated enough you can leave anyway but the biggest thing here is that when i used to work in consultant it was kind of like the army you know it's when there's a war the troops go and fight where the war is if you're a consultant you're sent wherever the client is wherever all the any any it might be a different country and i've been all over the place doing that many countries and there's actually um there's a guy who who used to be the cochairman of goldman sachs and he actually came and lectured at columbia university uh and i think his name was uh was was stephen levitt i think yeah um actually i gotta go find out right now because his son actually is the guy that wrote game of thrones let me let me go here here sorry i i have to find out right now uh but but i remember he was there and i was in new york and i was about to join goldman and goldman wanted me to start my career in tokyo and and i didn't want to go and so what i did um hold on a second bend the office guy's last name i'll talk about this guys what i did was it was i said to him i'll get that second i said do i really have to go and he stared me down in front of everybody there's like 60 people in the class said yes you do so if you want to get promoted to a senior senior level in companies sometimes you have to move if they tell you to move it sucks uh but but if you do that you take one for the team but don't go unless you get something promised in return you know basically say i'll go but i want to make sure i get promoted and you can hold up you can kind of use that card and they'll promote you as they send you um but this guy's name um the guy that wrote like game of thrones uh he um okay so he was the the screenwriter david benioff and his dad was a professor steven somebody i gotta know because he changed his last name benioff yeah steven friedman it was steven friedman yeah yeah he changed his last name from benioff to friedman because there's lots of david friedman that are writers but that's his dad yeah his dad was um goldman sachs where is he getting here now now i'm curious stephen friedman that's right here is the guy this is the guy that that stared me down yeah yeah then eventually he went into government because at goldman sachs i worked at goldman for years and i understand after i left why so many successful politicians from goldman sachs er come out of uh by so many successful politicians come out of goldman sachs yeah yeah it's tough place to work but it's fun too i'm proud it's on my resume and again they don't have the smartest people in the world way off track okay anyway next up mr bean uh facetime is important i hate it you know but but early on your career when you're first starting out you got to be first in and you got to be last out okay it's something i i call philo first and last out it sucks and hopefully you don't have kids and all that stuff um when you first start your career but but it's important it's important um i hate it i hate it but it's important face time is important and michael bloomberg who started he's a billionaire he started bloomberg and he was mayor of new york whatever for a while that's what he did early in his career he would show up for anybody and um yeah that that's base time was important i got that one from him actually yeah he's done quite well all right next up is dta which stands for don't trust anyone sharks are tough to spot sometimes it's so true it's so true um usu when you go with your gut usually you can tell somebody's a shark but sometimes you don't know like if push comes to shove and you're competing with somebody get promoted at work um don't trust them man don't trust anyone like just be really really careful like don't date anybody at work either ever unless you're sure it's uh if you're positive this is the one this is the one yeah just be careful dta don't trust anyone okay and i debated whether i include this one or not and actually in my book i renamed this chapter it was it was chapter 59 in the paperback version and the kindle version um and i actually changed the title because i angered people then i'm including it now so it's good i don't care so um a valuable lesson about donald trump so and when i wrote this book is before trump got elected but but years ago i i read i read a book from trump called uh the art of the deal and this guy can get a deal done he can't nice let's be intellectually honest he can't especially in business but he said something um years ago that made a lot of sense and when i first heard it i thought oh my god that's i don't know if i agree but he said you have to remind people of your accomplishments otherwise you'll never reach you know your highest your potential in life and as a canadian you know growing up we're very humble whatever it just wasn't our nature you know um you know wayne gretzky used to say when when when you when you lose say nothing when you win say even less but but trump is right trump is right um if you don't remind people of of your accomplishments you'll never get promoted uh you'll never get you'll never be able to raise money you'll never get customers you got to remind people and and sometimes it's as simple as you're trying to get a big contract in your sales person you have to remind the person that you're meeting with after you bond which other big contracts you've signed in the past big reference customers if you're allowed to disclose it and you have to brag about your accomplishments as well um and there's ways to do it like i'm going to brag in a second and and you'll see how i'm going to brag and it won't come across as as being a big brag here we go oh my god i talk a lot i'm humbled to say that i think that i'm a very good judging character so you i i through the beginning part and i'm humbled to say that you know whatever uh but yeah and trump certainly doesn't do it that way uh but if you don't um if you don't remind people your accomplishments you'll never get a promotion you won't you'll never get a raise you'll let you never get a job you'll never get anything in life you have to do it you have to it's going to be humble but at times you have to brag it's a do or die mentality okay uh and and yeah here um ask often how am i doing how am i doing and i got this one from another goldman sachs partner that i met with when i was at coleman you have to ask how am i doing often not all the time but every month or two meet with your manager and ask her him you know okay you know i really enjoy being here at the hermitage or whatever you know what i mean i'd love you can please provide me some feedback on on how i can contribute more to the team even more at the time and they'll start off by saying positive things if they're a good manager and then they'll tell you additional things that you can do and you can even ask them was it you know to get promoted to the next level like what else do i need to do what else do i need to do and they'll tell you and once you accomplish that stuff remind them when they're in a good mood it's kind of like asking mom and dad for something only when they're in a good mood remind them that when you've accomplished those things so you can get that promotion but you have to ask how i'm doing often and if you do that you'll most likely never get fired or at least surprised uh and fired yeah always ask for feedback otherwise you just don't know how good of a job you're doing all right um and the only way to get promoted or a raise and i was looking for the energizer bunny i couldn't find it so i threw the durabell duracell battery in which takes a licking and keeps on ticking that's what they used to say i think so or is that time asked can't remember uh but the bottom line is you just got to be relentless you got to be relentless and ask over and over and over and over and over and over again to get a raise or promotion and there's tactful ways to do it too and you don't have to be annoying about it um or piss off your manager you meet with them every couple months and when you ask how am i doing that's when you ask you know it and maybe you strike when they aaron's hot when you achieved a milestone and they give you great feedback then you you say awesome awesome do you have time for coffee now and you go for coffee uh and you'll say thank you very much for the kaufman i appreciate it it's it's been great being a member of this team and together we've accomplished a lot you know what i'm doing here right so that then you say well i'd love to ask you if it's okay what do i need to do and it's really making this it's really expensive living um here with the family and whatnot as you know and i have to provide and so i'm i'd love to ask you please what do i need to accomplish how much more how much about more value can i add and what kind of value can i add to the team in order to get a raise or a promotion and and they'll give you the criteria and the second you achieve those criteria and your boss is in a good mood and it's not too busy crazy at work it's a slow day meet with them and ask otherwise you won't get it you won't get it people that make ceo are ones that have asked that have asked many times to be promoted and many times for a race they're sales people they're selling themselves they're relentless and they brag as well about their accomplishments tactfully tactfully if you don't remind people of your accomplishments and if you don't ask for a raise or promotion you'll never get it you'll never get it it's kind of like when you were younger and you were in school you kept your head down and when when you did well in a test you were congratulated your parents are happy teachers are happy everyone's happy you were happy then you graduate and you start working and you keep your head down and you work hard and you do well and you think to yourself well somebody's going to notice me just like in school and then you look around you're like dude why are these people getting promoted instead of me i accomplished so much more than they did oh my gosh that guy got a big raise i didn't what's up with that it's because they asked so you gotta ask all right um next up is uh there is a plan b uh before you quit uh and that's by the way it's an american power conversion uh older backup battery i've got four of them here uh running just in case because i blew a fuse once or twice because of all this equipment and lights and stuff in the air conditioning too but i put it there because before you quit let's say you got a job a job offer from another company for more money and a better position whatever whoa that scared me sorry that was my alarm that remind me to put the kids to bed but there's no school tomorrow so it's fine we're good we're good um sorry about that so before you quit think to yourself why are you quitting you're probably quitting because this other company is paying you more money or this other company is giving you responsibilities that you enjoy more or this other company is giving you a different type of role in a different geographical location whatever it is you got nothing to lose so when when you go to tell your manager that you're resigning um just let them know that you've you've been offered a job and before quitting there's nothing wrong with asking them if they could match that offer or find you that other role internally so you can transfer you got nothing to lose nothing to lose and everything to gain okay uh next up is avoid this at all costs okay and duff beer what is duff beer from you got to tell you what duff beer is from um it's a great cartoon that i've been watching since the 80s and i can't believe it's still on uh and i'll tell you what it is in a minute if you don't already know and conan o'brien used to be one of the writers okay but i want you to avoid alcohol at all costs um at all events right and i i used to drink i don't drink anymore and not judging anybody it's fun but i want you to be careful and what my what my my grandfather god bless him he gave me advice as well um when i was going to my first job i asked him i asked a ton of people for advice and he said to me he said chi chi christie when you go to a corporate party if if you're forced to drink just take that drink whatever just i don't know when no one's looking throwing the plants yeah and i thought i'm not going to do that he said or what you can also do is just get a 7up with lime in it or sprite with lime in it because that looks like a gin and tonic or something anyway just be careful with alcohol at work it's it's so weird because i used to go out and party whatever and i worked at hedge fund industry in different companies i had a blast like i have no regrets but a lot of people they let their guard down right and a lot of these rules i've taught you today are humble lessons whatever like don't trust anyone whatever all that stuff like dude people people let their cards down when they drink at corporate events um and you know let them fall in their knives so to speak for their swords that was nothing to say but you know what i'm getting at i'd rather i'd rather you rise to the top um yeah so anyway that took me a while to create there there you go now you know where it's from now you know where it's from that that's that's uh mr burns uh front from the simpsons uh and he had this guy named smithers that worked for him and i remember one episode he said mr burns i love you in that shirt that's funny so number 64. and i couldn't get the eyes to work i don't know why so i just threw silver everywhere and had to recolor it but um number 64 is don't ever go over your boss's head um unless you have to and i'll explain what that means so don't ever talk to your boss's boss like you can say hello good morning whatever it is but just be careful just be careful uh and i've done it before just naively trying to help and i've added a ton of value and then my boss got jealous and yeah it happens just be careful however if you think you're going to be let go or if you work for a jerk and you got nothing to lose take that risk go to your boss's boss when your boss is not around add a tremendous amount of value i worked at a very big hedge fund once not gonna say which one and i got an offer from an even bigger hedge fund and the owner of the hedge fund that i was leaving said if you stay we might give you a more senior role and he was implying i guess i might get my boss's job i i didn't have the heart i can't do it i couldn't do it even though i've been for a heck of a lot more money i just can't it's not me it's not me but that option's there yeah yeah so don't go over your boss's head yeah now you know what duff beer is from yeah now i got that song duff beer for me in my head okay here we go all right moving on speaking of the simpsons um my uncle i have to cross arms like like like homer that's homer simpson so funny his name is homer like that's supposed to be like an intellectual name my uncle who worked at general uh electric um i remember asking him when i was like what was i was 22 when i went to accenture in 94. yeah i remember asking for advice and and he said to me he said something i never understood he said well he said also don't ever date anybody at work um he was right about that unless it's a sure thing because he said you'll get fired or they'll get fired or both whatever it's yeah but he said to me something i didn't understand he said chris just be a nice dumb guy i was like what the hell does that mean i understand that it's my uncle mike he's great i love him he said just be a nice dumb guy and i didn't get it but i kind of get it now years later years later and um i think he was probably my age when he told me that's interesting wow basically what he was telling me was don't don't come across as a threat to anybody like especially your own level it don't be dumb whatever like that like he's mentioning here but just don't come across the threat just be you know be a nice guy or a nice guy whatever and you know don't try to show people up you know impress people you know your time to shine is when you impress your clients or your boss or your boss's boss if your boss is away and you just happen to be yeah yeah whatever um just be nice dumb guy don't come across the threat and a lot of times people that make it to the top sometimes they're sharks yes but they rose to the ranks as well with that mindset you know it's it's kind of like when you're interviewing to get into a company the hardest interviews are with people that are the same rank as you because they'll feel threatened yeah so now i understand be a nice dumb guy i'm homer yeah all right uh next one is uh never never complain isn't that a cool graphic i found there uh explain is that a complaint yeah and dale carnegie said don't ever criticize condemn or complain like let other people whine about things at work because if you complain just one time the wrong person that feels threatened by you somebody the same levels you whatever they'll say well chris was saying this just just be careful just keep it in your head keep it in your head and never bring it home as well like don't like when you go home don't don't complain to your spouse they bottle it up otherwise they'll they'll say how was work together and you're like oh god he's such a jerk again today it's not worth and then your kids find out your kids will say it and it slips whatever just don't do it don't don't bring your anger and frustration home like that just leave it at work just don't don't complain and you know what dude if you're frustrated good it'll motivate you to get a better job anyway you can move you're not a tree yeah focus always on what you can control in life all right now please go to your workbook and click on number 11 meaning section 11 on the front page and then i want you to please spend three minutes writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 11 to enhance your career you've got three minutes go section 12 only take advice from successful people it's crucial that you take advice from the right people the right people always always don't don't assume because somebody's confident they know what the hell they're talking about you know just take advice from people that have done what you want to do okay so less number 67 is you need yodas and i love this analogy uh yoda was a mentor for those that aren't star wars fans was a mentor to um luke skywalker and you need many yodas you need lots of mentors in your life and i want you to find people that work in the industry that you want to work in or currently working or people that have a perfect lifestyle that you want meaning they have a wonderful family life and they found worklife balance and they're successful and people love it when you ask them to mention them as well you gotta ask though right so you need to have many yodas and if you're working at a company now and you're not happy in the division you're in you've got to network internally and find mentors in different divisions and get them to pull you into their their team or if push comes to shove and there's a restructuring round and people are going to be let go including you maybe you can call your yoda in another department and ask them uh for help and hopefully they can pull you in you need yodas all right next up is i want you to follow people that inspire the heck out of you or are doing what you want to do one day or they're they're they're business tycoons they're amazingly successful and i put the graph there for audible which is owned by amazon and you can subscribe for a monthly fee uh i recommend doing it it's a great investment in yourself it's investment education and i want you to listen to um at least one or two books per month from successful people autobiographies or biographies if you can't find them and if you can find them where the the person that that wrote it if it's an autobiography narrates it themselves like so richard branson that's even better because you can hear their positivity in their voice and people really let their cards down once they've achieved success and they want to share success and help you to kind of pay that debt of gratitude forward so to speak so seek people find people that have written books or find the book names or whatever or or the business tycoons or icons and listen to their books so that you can understand their blueprint and why reinvent the wheel they're going to help you do it anyway they've done it they've done it and i'd love you all to one day turn your business icon uh into your rival turn your business idle into your rival yeah all right next up is i've never never met a successful person with a negative attitude and that there is uh one of searcher branson's companies uh virgin atlantic uh is i've never met anybody that's really really really successful in business that doesn't have a positive attitude because there's so much working against you there's so many naysayers around you saying you can't do it you can't do you can't do it don't take a risk you might fail people will laugh at you effort the people that make it big are the ones that are really positive really positive people make it big so if you're not a positive person it might be because you're hanging out with people that bring you down cut them off you can control your environment all right tied fun with that graphic there all right next up is follow the smart money i still want you to do your own research on all investment ideas but i also want you to be aware of who smart investors are and what type of investments they own and just learn from them as well always do your own research as well but i want you to be aware of who the smart investors are and follow the smart money so to speak and once you find investments that they've invested in then do a lot of research as well don't just take their word for it follow the smart money okay actions speak louder than words always too people like to vote with their wallet so please go to your workbook and click on number 12 meaning section 12 on the front page and as always please spend three minutes writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 12 to enhance your career thanks do next up let's talk about section number 13 which is called only the paranoid survive uh it's crucial to be paranoid about the issues i'm going to talk about in a second and as you can tell there the one there uh in the 13 those are those are chips and i've actually got it right here let me go off script it's a it's a pentium processor so i have those chips there in the 13 and it's from intel because there's a brilliant man uh who passed away recently god bless him he's one of the cofounders of intel um in his name is andy grove and he wrote a great book that you guys should read called only the paranoid survive and he was so paranoid running intel and intel is is a company that makes chips we all know that but what many of us forget or didn't know as documented in his book which came out in 95 95 or 96 i think i loved it intel back in the 80s and the 70s uh they made uh ram right which is random access memory uh which basically is a commoditized industry there are little chips that allow your computers to have more programs open at once and what happened was that the japanese were so competitive with intel in the early 80s in japanese companies at that time they were more interested in market share than they were in profit margin and so they they basically flooded the market with cheap ram and it intel could have gone out of business and so what happened was uh andy grove he he pivoted and he made the company focus on a new product for them called the intel processor they had what's called the 286 and 386 and 486 and pentium and all that stuff whatever you probably heard that in the past uh but andy grove was was very very paranoid uh of the competition and bill gates was the same way too when he was running microsoft bill gates used to say that microsoft is always one and a half years away from bankruptcy he even said that in the 90s and of course we we know that there's no way it would go bankrupt within a year and a half but that's how paranoid he was you got to be paranoid like that like i remember i remember steven friedman and and i have the the notebook actually and i mentioned him before his son is david benioff friedman was a senior dude at at goldman and i wrote down every word he said when he came to guest lecture and i still had the notebook and i read it the other day but what he also said was watch your back because there's always somebody that's smarter faster younger cheaper than you that wants your job uh and it's it's it's kind of that's part of paranoia as well so just be careful like like for me for example i've got multiple audio tracks right now just in case it it messes up like i've got i've got a blue yeti there i've got this sure mic here i've got cheap microphones and all the cameras as well really really cheap ones just in case and so we can synchronize the video as well um just in case one of the things goes down um and whenever i give presentations i always have a second laptop which i used to borrow from a friend now i have my own whatever i'm a nerd i know uh and when i raised to give wedding speeches i would use a laptop and i'd also bring overhead slides just in case always have a backup plan always always always when i used to go to interviews i would over prepare and i would always bring a nutribar and put it in my pocket because a lot of times they forgot to feed you and if you can't if you if you're hungry you can't think and so i would go to the washroom and you know gobble down the the nutribar um but but but i was i was very paranoid and i think it helped me a lot to have a plan b and it made me more confident as well in case something didn't go well i had a backup plan so for intel the backup plan was the processor so you always want to have a plan b always always always yeah only the paranoid survive great book by andy grove read it please all right um next up is hit this key and lose your job we are one little keystroke away from destroying our lives just be careful otherwise what can happen your career is you can quickly be end it just be careful triple check all your emails you are a product a representation of of the digital communication you send out um don't just spell check and grammar check but also think to yourself can this be misinterpreted by anybody and if you're ever emotional or upset just get away from email man or from your your cell phone or whatever it is just be careful your career can be ended quickly and this is a mechanical keyboard here and i love these clicky keyboards by the way i have one like that it's by a german company called dust keyboard yeah all right next up is let the secret out and you're done and that secret is that you want to leave your company and go back to school even if it's for whatever degree don't ever tell anybody don't ever tell anybody that you want to leave unless you want to get a reference letter whatever which you can ask in a more diplomatic way which i can talk about if you want me to but if you tell somebody that you're interested in leaving to go back to school at some point you know they might they might say oh that's great that's awesome i agree it's a good idea but then the next time a recession hits and business is very cyclical and companies tend to over hire when things are going well and they tend to over fire meaning they cut into muscle not just fat when things are not going well but if they have to the way it works in big companies is if companies have to you know cut expenses so they can make their quarterly earnings when they report earnings what will happen is management will tell all the bosses in all the different divisions i need one head each that's how it works it's quantitative and your boss will think themselves well and i'm going to make this up chris is great he's one of my best performers but he told me a while i remember a while ago he told me he wants to go back to school so if he's going to leave anyway i might as well choose him dta don't trust anyone don't tell anybody at all at work that you're ever thinking of of going back to school okay all right next up is oh dude this one was so dope that was boba fett boba fett was the best character ever uh and he was barely in star wars he was in revenge of the the jedi for like a nanosecond and then han solo turned around and he fell down into that big hole he died when hans was hans couldn't see and by the way i've got to go there i'm so sorry i don't care i'm going to do this i'm i'm a star wars fan so do i have my star wars thing there it's right here yeah yeah all right so there's politics in movies as well if you're a real jerk of an actor or actress you won't get rehired and that's what happened apparently hearsay whatever with megan fox remember she's in the transformers and stuff you don't see her anymore because she was she was difficult to anyway on one of those productions you can google it if you want to and a lot of great actors that you don't hear about anymore it's because they were difficult there's politics you know at their job as well like there's politics with us that's why i'm talking about sharks but i have to talk about harrison for it because he's he's he's awesome he was so difficult to deal with in empire strikes back so difficult when they were making it that what they did was they didn't know if they were going to bring him back in to return the jedi and so what they did at the end of the empire strikes back is they froze him remember that he was frozen um anyway and they ended up bringing him back and and that's why we're talking about boba fett when he couldn't see because he was unfrozen for a while and return the jedi he yeah anyway but you gotta admit boba fett's pretty pretty dope pretty badass yeah yeah so i always have a personal backup plan okay and what remind me to do this is because boba fett's dad or something had a gazillion versions of himself made cloned whatever but always have a backup plan in terms of what do you do if your company might let you go um and a lot of times you won't know because what can happen in business is everything is going well and then we go into this horrific recession in a nanosecond or something like um like a black swan event occurs like like a virus or whatever it is or terrorist events or i don't know the 2008 crash whatever it's something you can't control they call it black swan because black swans are rare they're usually not black yeah so the backup plan is this i don't want you to be loyal to any company that's right you're thinking chris that's not ethical loyalty i'm sorry i swore but i want you to remember this no company is going to be loyal to you and your family okay when when when push comes to shove they have to let people go you got to be loyal to your family first than yourself than the company that's right that's right you got to look out for yourself and if you don't look out for yourself and have a plan b then you're hurting your family or your future family and so if a headhunter calls you that's why that's why i put both that's right he's uh he's a headhunter or something or a bounty hunter bounty hunter that's why i put him but if if a headhunter calls you um saying that they're interested in interviewing you to maybe hire you or whatever take that meeting take every damn meeting and just don't meet with them in a place too close to your work obviously and and by the way if if your company gives you um if they give you a cell phone at work if you have um if you have enough money to do it i want you to get the exact same one for yourself because at work you know you're gonna be using that phone whatever but i also want you to have another phone just in case in case you want to make personal calls or in case and it's a good investment in case uh some other company calls you and you're setting up an interview you don't want you don't want anybody to be able to fish through your emails and personal stuff also if you work for a jerk and you will one day uh i'm not hiring though in case you're thinking i'm a jerk no but if you work for a jerk um and this jerk makes you stay late at work just for facetime whatever and it's bogus i want you on your laptop whatever to use your personal wifi network with these things and write a business plan on their nickel that's right if legally you're allowed to start screw that i don't care i'm i'm a pit bull and a pork chop helping you always have that plan b always always always please yeah all right next up is question motives and why do i have an old tv there i i have a tv because um whenever somebody's being interviewed on television i i want you to before accepting what they say is gospel or being true or legitimate or whatever i want you to ask yourself what's their angle why are they saying that what's their bias remember bias always if it's a ceo they're saying great things about the company because they're sales people that's their company they're not being unethical but they're biased of course they're going to say great things always and if somebody's interviewed that's a money manager like maybe they're a portfolio manager at a mutual fund or something of course you're going to talk about the stocks they own even if they disclose it of course they're going to say positive things about it there's a bias they want to get you to bottom to push them higher so always ask yourself why are they doing that you know why you gotta in your in your mind question motives and it's part of game theory which is like chess thinking a couple heads uh moves ahead of what somebody might do it's game theory always question somebody's motives not out loud but just in your mind you know it's not as politics and work and paranoia within within corporate environments is is all about game theory and chess moves you want to understand somebody like what their background is you know what their interests are and just more about them you know that's game theory you're doing your research um you want to think like they're going to think when you meet with them and you can always go to their twitter profile to see who they follow to learn more about them yeah or the bottom of their linkedin profile to see which companies or people they follow and by the way don't ever follow politicians ever ever ever on linkedin or on twitter you know if you're curious what donald trump's going to say on twitter you can go and type up the real donald trump and see for a while but don't follow you know even if you're republican it doesn't matter just yeah be careful all right um that's paranoia i guess all right and that's what the back of tvs used to look like there yeah they weren't dude they were massive back then massive yeah all right uh so now i want you to go to your workbook and click number 13 meaning section 13 on the front page and then spend three minutes writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons we just talked about here in section 13 to enhance your your career you got three minutes go all right section 14 risk taking i love this one i love this one it's crucial you take the right kinds of risks you'll never get ahead in life unless you take risks and plenty of risks and embrace failure embrace failure and fail fast and i'll get to that soon all right so let's talk about risks yeah fail fast and fail early okay um if if you start a company give yourself two years and after two years i want you to ask yourself if i had known about all the issues that i uncovered i discovered over the past two years would i have still have started this company and the answer is no pull the plug move on you're going to start a lot of companies in life and as mark cuban said you only have to be right in business one time every single amazing business person you know of you only know about their successes you don't know about the crappy companies they started and they failed the best you know like uh bill gates and paula allen together they started a company called trafford ida where they had these little wires on roads you know when you go over it and it counts cars they failed yeah so fail fast and fail early and don't give a damn what anybody thinks anyway because you are going to make it huge one day regardless what anybody thinks you give a damn what people think anyway fail fast fail early keep moving forward all right next up is opm not the drug but opm stands for other people's money and that's danny devito great actor funny man um he was in this movie called other people's money which is a great movie you gotta watch it because it will explain to you what is private equity in a fun way it's a great movie and like every hollywood movie the rich person loses at the end or is a schmuck or becomes nice or whatever it is what it is there's no exception every movie because i have to appeal to everybody whatever i should stop now but um i actually learned that from rush limbaugh is that terrible years ago uh the the rich person's always a schmuck a movie but but watch that movie if you can because it'll really explain you what what opm other people's money and how private equity works but the reason i put opm here in devito is because i don't want you to use your own money to start companies if you have a lot of money yes you can but i don't want you to put your family at risk or put too much stress on yourself i want you to raise money from high net worth investors but i want you to raise money from high net worth investors initially okay now the sales cycle is quite shorter than going after venture capital and if you network and find something in common with people and you present with passion right from your heart like i'm going to teach you you will be able to raise money and when you raise money i want you to make sure that you pay yourself the same salary at least that way you make at that previous company you're at because i don't want you to bring your stress home i want you to make sure your family is happy and you're happy as well use other people's money you can do it if if you don't think you can then you won't be able to but you know it as henry ford said whether or not you think you can do it you're right be relentless like a pit bull on a pork chop and it will happen i promise you all right next up is um don't invest if all the founders have left and i put here and you can go if you want just do it do a search um on on me chris haroon venture beats so venture beat is the it's it's like the wall street journal but for uh for uh for venture capital um and then you just you'll find this article i wrote years ago uh and i wrote about this and i really do believe it that um when i found and i was just a guest columnist i love writing like it's fun for me and it's good for your career too and we'll talk about embracing the media really really soon how can help you it's free pr everybody wins they win you win so network a lot to get meetings with the media and i'll talk more about that later on but when um when a founder leaves a company when all the founders leave a company and are no longer engaged at all you gotta run for the exits man you do because most of the time that company won't be as successful in the long run because what happens is founders run a company and the board loves the founder and investors love the founder and the founder doesn't give a damn about anybody except making that company change the world in the long run and so they're given a lot of leeway like jeff bezos or elon musk whatever um i shall let me stick with with jeff bezos on this one so jeff bezos he doesn't even get on the earnings call the quarterly call he doesn't care he's longterm focused he doesn't care if people are saying well you're not going to be making a big profit this quarter so you know i i think we should find another ceo no investors are longterm greedy and focused on bezos that's why they own amazon if he left that company point watch out because what would happen is this like it does with most other companies where the founders all leave and are no longer engaged usually what happens is bureaucracy and politics rule everything because if if you're at a and it happened with with uh with buddies of mine i worked at hewlettpackard you know they were senior executives and they didn't want to take any risks because you know they were getting a nice paycheck and climbed the corporate ladder and if they took a risk and they created a new department or product they they if they messed up they're not going to get promoted they're done and if they are successful with that they're not going to get paid a huge amount anyway so the status quo is keep being a politician collect that paycheck you know grip and grin which i despise climb through the ranks and and be political i hate it but if the vander still there the founder doesn't give a damn about politics the founder is longterm focused remember what warren buffett said the longer the view the wise intention and they're not political at all so be careful be careful about when founders all leave a company all right so please go to your workbook and on the first page as always click on number 14. uh and then um spend three minutes writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 14 to enhance your career you've got three minutes go do so sales best practices uh the best ceos are the best sales people learn these crucial sales secrets and i think i messed up the graphic i mean it it looks the way it's supposed to look but what i was trying to do there is this is actually a setting from the first movie blade runner 1982 classic um and it's one of those chinese restaurants that harrison ford ate at anyway i had a lot of fun doing this i feel like an artist with this a crappy artist i get it like i'm no uh i'm no picasso and i'll leave picasso here to give me a little bit of uh inspiration and you got to do a search on picasso quotes he's got great quotes so anyway castle's my friend i have more hair than him though okay so um yeah let's talk about these ones here sales best practices number one is less is more always with corporate communications never have more than three sentences ever again in a paragraph less is more keep it short and we'll talk a lot about how to give a great presentation and how to raise money by having fewer bullet points on a slide i'm telling you you don't have to work as hard now three bullet points on a slide because we can't handle more than three things at a time uh on on a slide when you're trying to raise money whatever uh and if you do try to use images or some fun innovative way to do it less is more quite often people will only read the first page of a very very long report anyway less is more and if you have to write a big report then you know try to you know try to have like a summary on the first page or lots of summaries and i even did this um see the berlin wall behind there i even did this with this book like i realized that you know shorter chapters are better like each no chapter i don't think there's maybe one or two that are longer on the page but a lot of them are really really short really really short you know less is more and that's how people consume media these days you know gone are the days when you gone are the days when when you read a 5 000 word editorial article in vanity fair whatever it is or whatever newspaper it is less is more that's why twitter is twitter all right moving on oh yeah i started to use yeah movement here might be a little distracting sorry i want you to present with passion and enjoy public speaking condition yourself to love it and you'll excel at it and most people are terrified of it and i'm going to make you into presentation rockstars very very soon in the smc courses enjoy it embrace it all right next up is shut up and i say with love my heart speaking of the hardest up there i made it smaller but it's still beaten shut up if you think you close the sale don't sell past the close sometimes when you when you get the impression somebody loves a product that you're selling or service don't sell it anymore stop stop right away otherwise they're gonna think this this is what will be going through their mind okay they'll be thinking oh gosh i love this product i love this service gosh chris is doing a great job selling i love it i love it why does he keep selling it am i missing something am i a sucker why am i so lucky to be given this opportunity i don't trust him i don't know oh no i do trust him i don't i just don't know he's overdoing i'm not gonna buy next up is small clients are just as much work as big clients and sometimes a hell of a lot more try to bag the elephant if you can go elephant hunting that i don't mean that way but just try to get big customers if you know what i mean instead of smaller ones um because small small customers are small customers are more work than big customers sometimes they have more of their net worth with you and that's why um or they spent more money as a percentage of their net worth on on the product or service they bought from you than a bigger customer just be careful um you know i i i value all my customers uh and i love them all sincerely i do but and for me it doesn't matter it's kind of a moot point because all my customers are the same right it's the same pricing point always but when i used to work um and i would get customers the biggest customers were the best because the amount of time and handholding i had to do with them was much less because they were more sophisticated sometimes as well yeah be careful be careful all right next up we've got all i heard was not no i want you to sell sell sell sell sell sell sell and keep selling keep selling keep selling keep selling until you sense they're interested then stop talking until then keep selling selling selling selling and tell yourself in your mind all i heard was not no all i heard was not no and don't forget to ask for the sale like a lot of times people go to meetings sales meetings and they'll talk about their product and they'll have a great lunch with somebody whatever and they never ask for the sale you gotta ask but don't get discouraged until you hear the word no and by the way when you hear the word no it basically means not yet all i heard was not no all right next up talk business later bond as much as you can with your clients a big rookie mistake is you show up and you start talking business right away you know business we know it's about relationships first and product knowledge second talk business later okay all right how to get a meeting with anyone so the route of how to get a meeting with anybody is as we know you want to find something in common with them right and the stars kind of got all kind of a line for somebody to take a meeting and and love you and do business with you so you want to appeal that personal personal motive so to speak um find something in common with with somebody you know um and and i talked about how to get informational meetings using linkedin et cetera cover pages by finding something you have in common maybe you're from the same hometown talk about your hometown when you meet with them you know how to conduct that meeting anyway and talk about how your hometown has changed or the schools change whatever it is and what i was going to do actually for for this uh for this um let me go back actually i don't want to look at that baseball one yet now you're all looking at the baseball ones we're there let me go back here yeah so what i was trying to do initially and i couldn't find the right 3d models to do it was i saw this great movie ratatouille and great movie i'm sure you've all seen it it's about a rat that makes good food and there's a critic a really really mean food critic that comes into this dude's restaurant and the rat is nervous and so the rats like what kind of food should i make well i want to appeal this person's background his emotions and so what happened was the rats made ratatouille i guess that's why it's called that uh it's and when the food critic you gotta watch it man there's that one scene where they they pull in and push back at the same time on his face when he takes a bite of the ratatouille and he drops the the the fork in in slow motion and then the the food critic goes back in time and remembers growing up and his mom basically touching his face uh and giving him ratatouille as a child i couldn't find that image so i looked everywhere for it i couldn't find it but you got to check it out you got to appeal to emotions and find something in common with somebody as well it's a different angle different way of thinking but it works exceptionally well you gotta yeah every battle's law enforcement fought as you know um and speaking of ratatouille so the best restaurant in america is called french laundry and it's about a 40 minute drive north of where i live here um it's it's in napa valley i've never eaten there it's too expensive for me it's 500 bucks to eat there not including alcohol and what rats what the folks at pixar did was they actually went to um when they were doing research on the movie all the kitchen scenes for ratatouille were modeled exactly after french laundry uh up in napa valley it's pretty cool it's pretty cool and speaking this is a good little side note here but but speaking of um speaking of pixar in 2008 i went to a party here uh for one of my kids they were in the whole birthday party phase between the first grade and fourth grade whatever and i met this guy at a house here in hillsborough and you know a lot of my best contacts actually are through my my kids friends parents it is what it is and this guy at that point in time he worked at pixar and i asked him i said oh dude i'm a big fan what movie are you making next he said well it's this movie about this old man and this short little fat kid and there's a bird named kevin and they throw some balloons on the house the house goes up in the air and they go on a journey and i'll never forget what i said to him i said it very politely i said this i said dude that's a merchandising disaster like you're not going to sell any toys like it's it's like why would you why i mean the incredibles was awesome you can make incredibles part two three four five six whatever you make a gazillion toy stories because you know toy story you got all the toys and my kid loved that that woody or andy doll whatever it was um and buzz lightyear and he said to me he said you know chris we don't make movies we think people are gonna like we make movies from our heart we don't try to do it to make money it's not about money it's about touching somebody's heart by using our own heart and and my goodness was he right because up that movie was the bomb i loved it not a bomb it was awesome i loved it and the soundtrack too by michael cameron's last name but oh my god and there's one scene from that movie too where he goes his wife passes away it's sad but that like three or four minute entire lifespan of that guy's life um when he was young when he met her to the great pen he had remember the great pen he had uh got married they couldn't have kids and she passed away i'm just getting shivers thinking about the music just appealing emotions anyway it was a great movie a little off track there but thinking with your heart is great because if you don't think with this this don't work this ain't gonna work so always try to appeal the emotions uh if if you can i'm gonna put picasso back on the shelf here all right good all right next up is uh confidence uh leads to competence i love baseball i had to throw a baseball in there somewhere um and you'll never like athletes do exceptionally well because they're confident you'll never see an athlete who's who doesn't have confidence especially in baseball where dude like you've got somebody's throwing a ball at you that's 100 miles an hour that's curving it might hit you you got to be confident it's even harder in qriket dude because in cricket that ball can bounce as it's curving and then hit you and and there's a windmill as well it yeah you got to be confident i think therefore i am uh in lebron james before each basketball game he meditates and he thinks of himself shooting shots getting in it over and over and over again that's almost as good as practicing um confidence is a it's an attractive trait um and for those of you that are trying to get a date if you don't come across as co i'm not gonna i suck at dating but you gotta be confident man you gotta go in there ask somebody out and just tell yourself i don't give a damn if they say yes or no and if they say yes i'm not gonna i'm not gonna say do mind games never you gotta you gotta be confident you know what i mean polite but confident too yeah yeah all right so yeah confidence leads to a competence if you believe in yourself um there's there's nothing you can't do and that's why on wall street they love to hire former athletes actually a lot of the time give me one second check yeah all right um they like to hire former athletes because they're confident and a lot of jobs on wall street you're in sales and if you're confident and you're selling not arrogant but if you're confident then confidence leads to perceived competence all right next up is sports is crucial boardroom talk it is it is um and not everybody's a sports fan and you can talk about movies and whatever arts or whatever it is that interests you but talking about sports is i mean i could talk to anybody in about baseball at least if i meet somebody from st louis you know i'll talk about one of the best pitchers in history bob gibson if i meet somebody from baltimore they'll talk about cal ripken the iron horse and some of you might not know who these people are but i say this only because if you tell me what city you're from i i will immediately talk about a baseball team in that city if there's baseball and that's it overseas it might be you know football like the real football like the one you you kick soccer yeah um don't don't underestimate how important sports is you know that's why a lot of corporations they do a lot of sporting events like they'll they'll take clients to to tennis matches um they'll you know they'll rent out boxes at football stadiums basketball stadiums i've gone to a ton of hundreds actually of baseball games and boxes as well as basketball games too in hockey games too when i worked at golden we actually had a suite and maple leaf gardens years ago yeah it's important it's important and and i say boardroom talk because there's always before a board meeting starts you know people are always just kind of hanging out and haven't seen each other in three months board means usually quarterly and you know before the minutes i read from the previous meeting and somebody says let's start the board meeting you just chit chat and usually talk about sports or something else you have in common just it's great for idol chit chat and you can always go to somebody's um twitter profile see if they follow athletes i follow jesse barfield he used to play for the toronto blue jays and you can tell i'm a blue jays fan it's it's it's in my heart like i love it i love it it's what my brother and you know my dad and i have in common and my kids love it too and it just i just love it i absolutely love it um and it's a great way to bond with people as well and i remember in 1992 we finally we won our first world series typical american oh my god people can be pissed off i don't care here we go it's called the world series because well it was always called the world series even there's only teams in america and they they put a team in toronto as you can see there in 1977 that was the first game and then in 1992 we finally won the world series in toronto and of course i had that i got teased all the time by my american friends who are very witty they teased me about boots being canadian so i teased them i remember that 92 after on the world series i was like ah ah yeah we won the world series yeah who's who's the king now huh and they said to me it was so funny it was good the retart was yeah so what dude your americans beat our americans i was like oh shut the up okay anyway it was funny sports is crucial boardroom talk yeah all right next up is golf often and i know golf can seem expensive it's not if you look around and play at crappy places which is what i do in fact my son dylan um it was personal here so my middle child here dylan it's like a son of me i'll stop using the same jokes over and over again i promise you oh here we go you can kind of see it there yeah okay i should use this one to begin with so uh dylan this guy here in the middle his golf teacher uh is a guy named matt who's uh my videography i i hired him he's a great guy he's a great guy i met matt at crystal springs which is a golf club where it cost you 30 bucks play around it's a great deal it's a great deal um but um and actually i'll talk about the reason why i hired matt only because he's editing this i'm just kidding um so he was um he's really social and you can pick up a conversation with him about anything anything nice guy nice guy um and and he noticed that i was reading a book on youtube and he said to me oh cool you're looking into youtube whatever and then i sized him up in 30 seconds i knew i knew right away but he talked about green screens and all this stuff nice guy though nice guy more important than anything else you know relationships are more important than product uh product knowledge uh but but you got to make sure that um if you can get on the links and golf with people and don't worry if you suck and you're new to it so what so what i don't know like get out there have fun with a couple of buddies you don't have to be me and by the way i've learned a lot about people by golfing with them if somebody cheats in golf i'm convinced they're going to cheat in business i've seen it i've seen it yeah yeah golf off and uh if you can if you can yeah all right uh and it's always like i've actually i've gotten some of my biggest investors on the golf course by accident like they ended up playing with us on an average course whatever they're like hey do you mind if we there's two of you there's two of us can we play with you and i met people that way and they become my biggest investors yeah it's amazing um yeah anyway next up is number 16 which is dress for success it's so true um you got to play the part like a lot of times before you get promoted you have to kind of dress um like somebody one level above you very subtly don't overdo it um but you have to dress for success and people will judge a book by its cover so you know like in silicon valley it's a little bit different here you can just kind of be laid back and whatever wear crappy clothes and people wouldn't be wearing what i'm wearing but i think it's important it's important how you carry yourself especially because you're not going to get too much exposure to senior executives right away dress for success all right next up is leverage the media oh yeah this is where i was going to come back to it so mark benioff who uh he's the founder of the largest company here in san francisco called salesforce.com and a wonderful humanitarian a good guy i read his book called above the clouds where he had a bunch of tips on how to make it and one of them was leverage the media and i first met mark i think a couple years before salesforce went public in o4 and i i remember he was at all the goldman sachs conferences when i worked at goldman and then later on when i was a client of goldman in the hedge fund industry and he was always on panels saying software is dead software is dead cloud is the future the cloud's the future and we're all like i don't understand but he sounds passionate so cool i like it and he was selling something you can't see feeler touch something virtual something boring cloud computing but he made it exciting but he was being controversial it was brilliant by saying that software is dead and i ended up working in his building same building one market plaza here in san francisco and actually i'd see him sometimes walking his dog and bare feet his beautiful labrador in bare feet on on the main floor the lobby the public lobby he didn't give a damn that's why he's successful he doesn't care and i remember once i went out to dinner with him and i sat beside him before the ipo and we were up in the bank of america tower on like the 50th floor uh and i'll never forget he wore hawaiian shirt he was just himself it's just mark it was cool man mark with a c and it was a a a fee pricks or fixed menu or whatever it is and what happened was every time they brought some food over he didn't want he very nicely gently took his knife and fork and put into a big x but he was just himself but he leverages the media big time and the way he leverages the media is he's controversial and controversy sells and you got a network and i taught you how all how to network uh using your backgrounds and all good stuff linkedin find journalists and meet with them okay and and be a little bit controversial as well like for me if i were to do it and i'm probably not going to but if i did i would say twothirds of harvard business school hbs twothirds of hbs is bs and if i went on talk shows and did that i get some air time then they'd say what about harun business school i said it's a different age okay leave me alone but i could do something like that or like if you look at um richard branson when he launched virgin cola one of his many virgin companies and he declared a war on cocacola and pepsi he rented a tank in the early 80s and drove through times square with virgin cola cans all over it of course you couldn't do that today but he was controversial controversy works leverage the media as much as you can because it's free advertising as well if you do it right all right next up is please go to your workbook and click on number 15. the cover page meaning section 15. then please take a boot three minutes writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 15 to enhance your career you've got three minutes go so so section 16 think different i love this section i had so much fun putting this together uh and i wrote the top there crucial highly profitable differentiation strategies uh and so what you see here really shapes my character this changed my life this computer here and i never threw it out um and so let me let me grab it hold on a second whoops this here is from an old um this is a before that mac came out this is from apple ii which we had as a kid and um i just pulled this out for the first time in decades and on it here i don't know if you guys can see it i'll read it you probably can't read that uh but it says um getting older i gotta look like this galaxian um ms pacman hero and mario brothers and championship load runner yeah oh and i took a hole puncher i remember this i took a hole puncher here so that you couldn't erase it i guess on both sides or whatever it is this is in the days when you take the disc out and flip it but this here is from an apple ii um and let me just put this down here this thing changed my life okay and and i remember when um steve jobs decided not to ship these things with disk drives anymore and people thought he was crazy he was thinking different he was brilliant because of it um i guess i can get a pin to take that out there but whatever um yeah this is msdos years ago but i remember i was um i was younger and they wanted to fail me in the sixth grade in the eighth grade and it was because well they thought i had a learning disability but them sorry i have this gripe with teachers like my school i went to when i was younger it's a wellknown school whatever and they've asked me to come back and give guest lectures and keynotes or whatever it is never i'll never mention them either i think that a teacher should not have an us versus that mentality and look to look down upon students but treat the student as a customer uh and build their confidence right that's confidence is the most important thing in business one of the most important things you know with confidence you you can achieve anything last thing you need is is a a bastard teacher trying to bring you down or a teacher that's just teaching so that what they can do is they can do research in university that's why i love them teach um but anyway sorry there's a lot of beautiful wonderful teachers in the world okay most of them are sorry about that off topic but but they want to feel me and so i went to this it was a testing center uh in uh oakville so my dad says oakville ontario oakville uh on lake shore road called chisholm uh and they tested me there um whatever i think they were wrong i think they were but my dad bought me this and the second he bought me this everything took off for me i loved it i had fun with it you can tell i like i enjoy this stuff like i light up like a christmas tree like tweety bird like i enjoy this stuff i love using technology and that was my passion one of my passions i guess but this changed my life this this box here and the original ones if you open it this is not an original one but if you open it steve jobs and his whole team signed everything and this is ice put my mouse here i had a velcro on the side and i still do that actually under the table with other stuff yeah um you can see all the all the baseball stuff and everything yeah so anyway this thing here changed my life and so it it's fitting that we now talk about think different you know what i'll do is i'll i'll leave this dude up here with me actually i'll put it back here because that camera won't work all right so so think different is the title of this one here and i want the galera to get in your face there good okay think different and i used a product code called adobe dimension to make all this stuff if you're curious it's easy to use i can show you if you care all right so think different so lesson number 90 we're almost done is be a contrarian and watch your net worth soar um if you buy the same stock everybody else buys you'll i've said it before but you won't make money in the long run because who's the incremental investor to push it higher you've got to be contrarian and just be aware of bubbles they they occur yeah and hundreds of years ago in europe there was a tulip tulip bubble uh and everybody chased the momentum and kept buying these tulip bulbs which kept going up in price an insane amount um and if you weren't a contrarian you you lost your shirt and human nature repeats itself office all right next up is big companies cannot innovate and i'll always bet on two girls or two guys in a garage to change the world uh instead of a big company always always small groups of people can always change the world always always always i think it's competitive advantage and jeff bezos the way he runs amazon is he won't let any meeting take place uh if more than two pizzas are required to feed the room that's why amazon's still very successful they're big but they kind of run like a startup big companies cannot innovate remember that to the same extent uh especially i should say if a founder leaves i should correct that yeah if a founder leaves especially because after steve jobs left apple as much as i love apple what have they done you know they they made a watch which is doing okay they don't publish number of watches they sell because they're probably not selling as many as they thought they should have i don't know i still don't know what the killer app is for this thing i've i've got it or i put it aside here actually it's over here um i wear it and i met johnny ive um at um san francisco moma dinner events we were honoring him um and right when before this thing came out and i said to johnny i talked to him uh and he's the the guy he used to the british dude with a short hair with with a british accent he speaks good and all of us nice guy very serious though i asked him i said what's the killer app for this and he said we don't know yet but perhaps the haptic feedback which by the way is just vibration that's what it means but he sounded really smart by saying haptic feedback he said perhaps that haptic feedback will be a way for families and i enjoy it i have the product but he said it's a way for say a husband and wife they're in bed together and not that but there's a newborn baby in the middle sleeping with them and um the husband gets up or the wife whatever to go to work and if the alarm goes off it wakes up the baby is disaster so this is another way to wake you up whatever because it vibrates on your wrist but he didn't know what the killer wrap was at at the time but but since steve jobs god bless him has moved on they haven't really done that thing anything too radically different like they made a bigger ipad a thinner ipad a bigger iphone a cheaper iphone um yeah so anyway i don't think that big companies can innovate as much uh if the founder has left so don't don't ever feel intimidated by a big company because don't forget that apple was basically steve wozniak and steve jobs in a garage taking on ibm successfully yeah yeah so there it is there it is the computer changed my life yeah yeah all rights i'm going to show you this commercial to you now this commercial you're about to see was only shown one time in history it was shown in 1984 during the super bowl and 1984 is the title of a book by a brilliant man uh who wrote animal farm um the man's name is is george orwell about an awful future where we're slaves to the government whatever and so what happened was this commercial was only shown once and it was 1984 during the super bowl it cost a million dollars to make and ridley scott was the guy who directed he did gladiator uh as well as top gun um and um it was brilliant it was brilliant and as you watch it obviously you'll know which character represents apple and which character represents big blue or ibm uh and the woman actually that that um represents apple um was uh sylvester stallone's wife at the time so check it out i hope you enjoy this and while you watch it just remember that one person or a couple of people small groups people can destroy a big company today we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the information purification we have created shall talk themselves on january 24th apple computer will introduce macintosh and you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984. it's pretty powerful okay next up is the most important chart ever made okay um and i know i've talked a lot about a lot about a lot of important things so far but this is the most important thing okay so everything i've talked about so far is a bit important and we've seen a lot of charts in business this one is crucial please pay attention okay here it is right here we have pi i've eaten and right here we have pi i've not yet eaten no no i feel like that was phil dunphy from modern family i i feel like that guy people used to say that they remind me of a i remind them of phil dunphy that the father from the dad humor stuff from modern family okay i'll move on okay that was a joke all right the real number 92 is this ready this is good this is powerful form your own opinions dummy all right and i'm saying dummy with love my heart i don't want you to rely on anybody else's opinion i want you to rely on your own opinions always you know you you might think you're a cat adorable cat like that you look in the mirror you're not you're a ferocious lion right you're you're king or queen of the jungle nobody can touch you vincent van gogh said if you hear a voice in you that says you cannot paint then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced arthur ashe great tennis player he said one important key to success is selfconfidence an important key to selfconfidence is preparation over prepare for everything dude everything and that will help with your confidence big time if you prepare more than anybody else does for a presentation or a sports match or anything in business you're going to enjoy it and you're going to kick ass every battle is warm for it's been fun i think therefore yeah next up eleanor roosevelt oh this is a good one eleanor roosevelt said you wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom seldom they do it's powerful and if you guys want you can do a screen print and all these too let me go back a couple screens uh if you want take a screen print i'll go through it fast don't worry so take a screen print here whatever i'll give you three seconds to do it next one here and you can put this on your iphone or android handset as a whatever um and then one more here there we go and eleanor roosevelt by the way she also had another great quote which was something along the lines of they're going to criticize you anyway so you might as well just do it okay oh i love this picture this one's awesome look how adorable that cat is you yourself as much as anyone in the entire universe deserves your love and affection buddha you gotta love yourself mark twain he's great he said 20 years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you did not do than by the ones you did do so throw away the bow lines sail away from safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sail explore dream discover brilliant brilliant all right so form your own opinions please all right number 93 is take that walk i was inspired by gandhi with the salt march uh and i actually tried to um i tried my best to find one with a lot of people following it cost a fortune like i got a lot of these for free they're royalty free but there was one that cost a hundred dollars that was tempted so i didn't pull the trigger but but great man great man but so steve jobs used to go on these long walks every day at one o'clock and i do it as well and i put it on my schedule a lot of times take that walk and when you go for a walk it helps you to think differently it helps you to release serotonin it's it's like when you exercise when you feel like crap and then you do a little bit of weights whatever or exercise it releases serotonin in your brain makes you happier and this thing rewards this thing and a lot of my best ideas yeah i think about when i'm walking you know i've written entire courses on long walks i used to take 12 to 14 hour walks by myself uh it just it was lifechanging and it's fun too you can bring some tunes if you want classical music whatever um and then just go to a starbucks or tim hortons or coffee shop like that whatever it is and just just collect your thoughts yeah it'll allow you to kind of get outside your own body and see the forest from the trees and where you are in life and where you want to be yeah all right next up we've got passion for platforms that's a road obviously so the best type of business models you can create are ones where you you own the road and cars go on the road and you can charge the cars or the toll booths kind of like facebook is a platform for social media i don't trust them it's amazing facebook actually doesn't publish anything but they make money by publishing other people's stuff because it's a platform they're a tool keeper airbnb who'd have thought that the most important hotel company in the world wouldn't own a single hotel their platform same thing with uber who would have thought that the biggest taxi company in the world now uber doesn't own a single taxi they own the platform that's how i want you to think about business models because once you own the road then you can charge the car so to speak and you get other people to be incentivized to populate your platform it's brilliant the ebay has done it microsoft did with windows ios google it's amazing it's incredible all right next up we have don't respect tradition respect innovation i was trying to be innovative here as much as i could um everything is going to be disrupted and product cycles are getting shorter and shorter and shorter now and disruption is happening faster faster faster but just don't don't respect tradition i'm not saying you'd be a jerk whatever but just always question everything every product can be disrupted you know microsoft windows used to be the most dominant operating system platform on every device basically and then windows ce never worked like microsoft really should own the uh you know the smaller form factor operating system market they don't they don't don't respect tradition respect innovation always always always yeah i had a lot of fun making that slide all right so please go to your workbook and click on 16 on the cover page number 16. and then spend three minutes as always please writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 16 to enhance your career you got three minutes go section 17 it's crucial to find your passion you be you it's a little cloudy but what are we looking at there number 17 you be you we save the best for last here okay so i want you to be honest and speak from the heart always just be yourself you know people might not remember what you said but never forget the way you made them feel that's a great quote from maya angelou but just be you man just be you don't be a robot don't be data from star trek you know be kirk just your ursula just be yourself and and when you're up there on stage if you mess up whatever you ever see somebody on stage they kind of mess up a bit and you start liking them a lot more because they're a real person you kind of like that just be yourself don't give a damn what anyone thinks you got this far in life and your family and friends love you for being you so why try to be somebody else you know when you were younger in school you were yourself everyone loved you then you start working you get older and you're in the workforce whatever and you're not being yourself why what's the point do you know that when a senior executive walks by you in a big company and if you if you suck up to them or if you're not yourself do you know that they don't respect you more for that they lose respect for you and even worse your colleagues hate you for it just be yourself it's too hard to try to be somebody else anyway and as dr sue said the great thing about having kids is when you read them books at night sometimes i feel like the author of the book is is talking in two languages one to me and one of my kids you know it's like the simpsons it's so brilliantly written the simpsons when i used to watch it my parents were around my parents would laugh every now and then when they were half paying attention because it was written at a different level like they would quote old movies and stuff whatever but dr seuss he said those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind just be yourself everybody else is taken all right next up is listen to your spouse they love you they fell in love with a certain person that was themselves and that person might have changed a bit go back to being you listen to your spouse they will help you they'll help you a lot they'll be your your senate your sober second look when you have an idea that you're not sure if you should pull the trigger on so to speak careerwise you know sometimes you'll look to get advice from lots of people and you forget that your life partner the one you can trust most in life is right beside you remember why you got married in the first place you know only my wife can tell me that i'm wearing a shirt that went out of style eight million years ago i thought plaid was still in in style it's not apparently or if i've dyed my hair too dark i'm getting better now it used to be a little bit too dark at times um listen to them listen to them yeah so there's that guy too he looks kind of cool it's funny all right you be you listen to yourself next up don't let anyone rent space in your head don't ever be somebody else's prisoner don't give a damn what they think about you because as you become more successful they're gonna backstab you anyway and remember unjustified criticism is nothing more than a disguised compliment get them out of your head ethan those who mine don't matter and those who matter don't mind i had to say that one again don't let anyone rent space in your head live your life to make yourself happy don't live someone else's life to make them happy all right next up we've got take time for you damn it yeah you got to schedule time for yourself like when you make the the one pagers um and you can always download that again from i'll tell you in a second it's kind of complicated the link but i'm gonna show you the graph in a minute but take time for you like i don't know if you're stressed out like schedule time in for you to unwind and binge watch curb your enthusiasm if that makes you laugh or or i don't rent that movie you've been dying to see for a while um or take a day off from work and don't go because you're mentally drained take time for you take time for you schedule time for you otherwise you'll burn out and what's the point you're gonna make yourself happy and if you don't laugh every day you got to find a way to laugh every day what made you laugh when you're younger like when i started today's lesson today's uh lecture i sat in that chair that made me happy put yourself back in that situation remember the trigger point the trigger point is an event that occurred in your life that made you so insanely happy that when you think of it again shivers just thinking about it and this this one here this is the jose batista one here and by the way if you're curious these here are rookie cards for dave steve uh and um george bell another great blue jay player and i have velcro because i put them i have a man cave i built out the attic by myself it's a hack job i don't give a damn it's fun i learned a lot too and i put these all on the ceiling every blue jay card so anyway don't grow up people okay just be the happy you you were years ago you be you take time for you yes i collect baseball cards still oh one up i love it i love video games i love playing mario when i was a kid is it mary or mario i always forget and now when my kids ask me daddy can you help me with super mario galaxy or super mario odyssey's new one uh ow don't pull my arm too hard i'll be there in a second and help you i love it i love it but i wrote here you're you're never too old to start over you're never too old to start over you're not you're not um colonel sanders he actually used to live in my hometown of mississauga which is just outside toronto which has a bigger population mississauga than san francisco but most people don't know it but colonel sanders he started uh kfc and it's interesting it was actually for marketing reasons they rebranded kentucky fried chicken to kfc to deemphasize the the letter f for fry but when um colonel sanders he failed a lot in business his entire life then he was 65. way before i was born he was 65 and he started kfc and he made it huge he did really really well so you're never too old to start over and people today are living 26 years longer than they did back in the 1950s so if you're 65 you're not you're 39 and you're never too young to change the world as well look at the beetles i've actually got them can you see it up there yeah at the top there awesome the beatles up there that's abby road and by the way oh this is awesome the reason why um the reason why they did that album cover and it was so innovative at the time because it was the first album cover without the name of the band but they were the most four recognizable people on the planet but i gotta i gotta go off script and get this but they were gonna go to mount everest because this was gonna be the triumph their last big album uh ended up not being their last album and then what happened was they uh i don't know life got in the way and john was spending time with yoko and paul is spending time with linda and whatever and they're like screw it i don't want to go to everest that's a lot of work man so the name of the studio they were recording was called abbey roads and they walked right outside abbey road and they're like screw it let's do it let's just take a picture here let me get i want to show it to you so the beatles and i have to talk about this because you know the beatles but they did all their brilliance in their 20s in their 20s unbelievable so if you think you're too young to um change the world these guys did it in their 20s in their 20s it's unbelievable and by the way if you're old older like me and you're you you always wanted to start a rock band outfit do it now you'll be the first 80 year old rock star someone's got to do it we're living longer anyway so you're not 80 or 17 54. yeah all right so um i want to go through this here quickly i want to show this to you all right so abby road it's because it's cool and we're going to study this in marketing but i have to do it now i just have to i'll show it to you here actually what you've got here is they went outside and they took a picture and they learned that controversy sells in marketing okay so what they did was this there was a rumor that paul mccartney was dead there was a rumor he was dead um in fact if you listen to the end of strawberry fields and you play it backwards it says uh i buried paul um although john lennon said it actually says cranberry sauce it says i bury paul they're messing around with the media it and there's a rumor and then what happened was that rumor spread for a long long time and here in sgt pepper's there's a patch on paul's shoulder here you see this i got to make sure this the light's not there okay good hold on right there and people thought that said opd but it actually like officially pronounced dead opd that's actually opp yeah you know me opp is ontario uh provincial police opp because i used to live in the province of ontario we call them ontario party poopers and then um right here i think this is the best one to show here let me get it right because this is fascinating check this out this is cool being controversial helps you sell like mark benioff damn it okay here we go so you can see here this is a funeral procession uh and so john lennon is in white there okay and he's the priest then you've got uh ringo starr the drummer he's he's uh he's wearing uh he's the pallbearer the guy that carries the coffin then in the back you got the gravedigger which is george harrison um and then you've got paul mccartney who's in bare feet um smoking see the cigarette there in his hand signal uh signifying death because they even knew back in the 60s hey man smoking's bad and if you look closely this here is a volkswagen beetle it's a reverse here right right here beetle it's clever and the license plate if you zoom in it's probably hard to see here but it says 28 if meaning if paul mccartney were alive he'd be 28. they were playing around but controversy cells maybe have to hold up here and matt you can zoom in if you want there we go yeah yeah anyway so that's pretty cool and even on the back people thought this guy was a a skeleton or something whatever it's pretty cool pretty cool so um it was neat it was neat yeah yeah so and initially with this album they wanted to put which is oh my gosh it's genius they want to put it in a paper bag george mart the producer did and because they uh they thought they were gonna get sued by people here bob dylan everyone but whatever a little bit off topic there but interesting nonetheless we gotta pull this over here cuz we're gonna talk about this in a minute all right we're still recording great yeah so you're never too old uh to start over again right just remember that that uh john lennon song starting over um and i actually met annie levitz who took the the picture of john lennon actually uh on and i got to show you really quickly because i met her she's the best photographer of the last century she's amazing and she was at a benefit just around the corner here um that i went to and i got to meet with her and she she's amazing but let me show you actually so annie levitz and there's a reason i'm showing this okay annie leaves i asked her also like i do with everybody why are you successful and she had some unbelievable things to say uh but you've seen a lot of her her pictures right so um yeah leonardo dicaprio you've seen the cover of vanity fair demi moore and all that stuff there she is there she's wonderful star wars she's the last oh right before my goodness before she passed away that's right just amazing pictures but i asked her why are you successful and she said because her um my favorite actress in history here she said because when i was younger my father was in the army and we moved around all over the world and all over america and so i spent my youth in the back of a a station wagon a car and i kept i saw america through a different vantage point because i was looking outside the window and that window was a metaphor for a frame for a picture right is that right like that yeah yeah a frame and so she thought saw things differently and let me show you um i'll show you the john lennon picture she she took actually uh on the day he died and she my god this is brutal but the day that john lennon was shot um she did a photo shoot okay and she was working for rolling stone at the time uh and and she took um like this picture here right is is was one that's yokono and john lennon obviously it initially um i'll just show you these ones here so initially yoko wasn't supposed to be in the photo shoot and john said no she has to be and i only agree to do this photo shoot if you put yoko on the cover of the of the rolling stone magazine with me uh and so what what she did was um this is it here yeah um this is this is the cover here yeah so what what happened was uh he was some some jerk named mark david chapman uh took away john len's life with with a gun at the dakota on the upper west side in 1980 i think and then after the guy shot him after he shot lenin he was leaning again i'll show you that picture there sorry i'm going to scroll down he was leaning against uh a lamppost waiting for the police to arrive reading catcher in the rye yeah out there i know but um oh and so the editor of rolling stone of course they wanted to put uh john lennon on the cover with something on the lines of the the day the music died or something um and um just john lennon and he said absolutely not yoko's got to be there as well i i promised promised john lennon yeah but she showed a couple more pictures how she saw things differently like she took a picture of nixon um when when he was uh no longer the president united states and for those who don't know about this richard nixon used to be president who was no longer he was booted for lying about something yeah um and so she showed the picture she told me how she she wanted to think differently from from the peer group from other people and so she took this picture here and everybody took the picture of of nixon going i'm not a criminal or when he left her we were in the helicopter um and you can go that if you want but here's a picture she took which was pretty cool man and she saw she waited until nixon was in the helicopter leaving the white house launch she was there uh there's the washington memorial right there uh and she took a picture here of these these three dudes here putting their hands in her hat so that that hat didn't blow away which is pretty cool so anyway yeah pretty pretty pretty interesting but i had i had to pull the beetles into that it's kind of cool it's neat i love the beetles yeah all right let's move on now number 101
