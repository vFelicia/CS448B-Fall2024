00:03 - hi in this video we are going to be
00:05 - talking about the console what it is
00:08 - where you can find it and what you use
00:09 - it for now the console is very commonly
00:13 - used to display system administrative
00:15 - messages your browser has a console your
00:18 - computer has a console once you become
00:20 - more familiar with it you'll find it to
00:22 - be a really powerful and effective
00:24 - tool in JavaScript the console is used
00:27 - as a great tool for debugging and
00:29 - finding out where in your code there's a
00:31 - problem one of the most important words
00:34 - you're going to need to remember is
00:37 - console.log now console is the thing
00:39 - that shows the text. log means log it
00:42 - here write it here then there's some
00:44 - parentheses and you can write whatever
00:46 - you want uh now the process of doing
00:49 - this can be put anywhere in the lines of
00:52 - code just like in the last video we go
00:54 - down sequentially you can put some kind
00:56 - of statements that say you know if this
00:58 - doesn't work console laog this is broken
01:00 - online 43 or whatever you need to do to
01:03 - help yourself figure out what the
01:05 - problem is and where it's
01:06 - happening all right what you see here is
01:09 - the Chrome browser with the Chrome
01:11 - console the console can also be up on
01:13 - the side but we're going to keep it down
01:15 - below for now you are probably also
01:18 - seeing this
01:19 - console.log we are going to console log
01:21 - a string a string is inside quotes or
01:24 - single quotes like this uh let's
01:27 - console free code Camp Rocks now if we
01:32 - run this code right here now here it's
01:36 - false that's what it's returning to this
01:38 - but down here in the console you see
01:41 - free code Camp Rocks awesome right now
01:44 - we can also console a number like
01:49 - 1,24 and there it is and we can also
01:52 - console a Boolean which is a true or
01:54 - false statement do console log true and
01:56 - it's going to say true if we try and say
01:58 - a word like uh words and console log
02:03 - that it's nothing's going to happen that
02:05 - doesn't recognize words because it
02:06 - doesn't know if it's a string or what
02:08 - but once you put it inside of some of
02:10 - these guys then it knows what we're
02:11 - talking about you can also combine
02:13 - things so say I want to say console log
02:17 - uh
02:17 - Briana is and then true we'll see what
02:22 - happens there we get Brian is true you
02:25 - can see the color differentiation here
02:27 - if your screen's big enough uh if not it
02:29 - just says is and then true is in blue
02:31 - because that's a Boolean as opposed to
02:32 - the string uh you can use this in a
02:35 - bunch of different ways but this is what
02:36 - console really looks like

hi in this video we are going to be talking about the console what it is where you can find it and what you use it for now the console is very commonly used to display system administrative messages your browser has a console your computer has a console once you become more familiar with it you'll find it to be a really powerful and effective tool in JavaScript the console is used as a great tool for debugging and finding out where in your code there's a problem one of the most important words you're going to need to remember is console.log now console is the thing that shows the text. log means log it here write it here then there's some parentheses and you can write whatever you want uh now the process of doing this can be put anywhere in the lines of code just like in the last video we go down sequentially you can put some kind of statements that say you know if this doesn't work console laog this is broken online 43 or whatever you need to do to help yourself figure out what the problem is and where it's happening all right what you see here is the Chrome browser with the Chrome console the console can also be up on the side but we're going to keep it down below for now you are probably also seeing this console.log we are going to console log a string a string is inside quotes or single quotes like this uh let's console free code Camp Rocks now if we run this code right here now here it's false that's what it's returning to this but down here in the console you see free code Camp Rocks awesome right now we can also console a number like 1,24 and there it is and we can also console a Boolean which is a true or false statement do console log true and it's going to say true if we try and say a word like uh words and console log that it's nothing's going to happen that doesn't recognize words because it doesn't know if it's a string or what but once you put it inside of some of these guys then it knows what we're talking about you can also combine things so say I want to say console log uh Briana is and then true we'll see what happens there we get Brian is true you can see the color differentiation here if your screen's big enough uh if not it just says is and then true is in blue because that's a Boolean as opposed to the string uh you can use this in a bunch of different ways but this is what console really looks like
