00:08 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:11 - with Jesse I'm Jesse and with on this
00:17 - stream you all get to have a glimpse
00:21 - inside my day as a front-end developer
00:23 - at a small University so I do my best to
00:28 - narrate as I work and I take some time
00:31 - to do a question and answer session so
00:33 - usually we do Pomodoro sessions so
00:36 - 25-minute sessions of code take a five
00:38 - minute break for Question and Answer go
00:40 - back and forth like that until the end
00:42 - of the stream and then I answer all the
00:44 - questions that are left over sometimes
00:47 - that takes a while sometimes it doesn't
00:49 - but today we're going to continue what
00:51 - we have started yesterday which is doing
00:54 - some styling to our react projects using
00:58 - the latest version of material UI so
01:00 - material UI is a framework for a
01:07 - framework of react components that fit
01:10 - with the material design style so if
01:13 - you're familiar with pretty much any of
01:16 - the apps that Google has come out with
01:18 - with the exception of maybe a few of the
01:20 - older ones then you've seen a material
01:24 - design style let's see I want to start
01:29 - out first with a pull request so I
01:32 - received a pull request just a few
01:37 - minutes ago or maybe 10 10 minutes ago
01:39 - or so from Sebastian so I thought it
01:43 - might be cool to start with that pull
01:45 - request so I'll just go through how I
01:47 - normally review pool requests usually in
01:49 - the morning I come in and review any
01:50 - pull requests so I don't know that I've
01:53 - actually gone over that process on the
01:56 - stream so I haven't even looked at this
01:58 - pull request yet I don't know I don't
02:00 - know what's in it or how big it is or
02:02 - anything so this will be exactly my
02:07 - normal routine when when I see that
02:09 - there's a pull request so let's go oops
02:13 - let me type let me give you the n drop
02:18 - URL so if you want to see the site as
02:21 - we're working on it and be able to see
02:24 - it in your browser and use your own dev
02:26 - tools check out that link that I just
02:28 - put in a live chat
02:30 - I'm a paste it in there a little bit
02:31 - later on for for anyone who's joining us
02:35 - later so remind me if if remind me a
02:41 - little bit later on to paste it again if
02:43 - I forget and failed to complete total
02:46 - fennekin okay so it didn't work what's
02:48 - going on here oh okay you know what I
02:50 - changed the let me paste a different in
02:54 - I didn't realize I changed the local
02:57 - host so I need to do it again so I
03:02 - restarted my installed the latest Mac OS
03:05 - update and restarted and when I did oh
03:07 - my all my local servers that I had
03:12 - running shut down so when I went to run
03:14 - this again it ran it by default on
03:16 - localhost 3000 instead of 2001 so that's
03:19 - where the problem came in so I'm
03:21 - restarting it now with the correct port
03:24 - and this link should not work
03:36 - okay good it looks like it's getting a
03:39 - lot of status 200 okay is here and the
03:43 - console my other screen so so that's
03:47 - working let's go to I don't know why
03:52 - it's not pulling in any data so we'll
03:54 - take care of that soon but for right now
03:56 - I want to go over pull requests so first
04:00 - I'll go to github let me make this a bit
04:02 - bigger and increase the font size so you
04:06 - all can see what's going on so usually I
04:10 - come in here and I don't know why I'm
04:14 - not sure why I didn't get a notification
04:15 - about that usually I have a notification
04:18 - up here so that's that's weird does I
04:23 - didn't get the email I guess I could
04:26 - double-check yeah I did get the email
04:31 - about it so for whatever reason I didn't
04:33 - get a notification this time but
04:35 - normally it will notify you if someone
04:37 - submits a pull request to your
04:39 - repository but we'll just go in oh is
04:44 - this bullets in
04:51 - I might have to check out area it's down
04:54 - here so good in this bulletin react and
05:02 - I just got a slack message from one of
05:03 - my co-workers I stopped at the grocery
05:06 - store on my lunch break and picked up a
05:09 - bunch of cinnamon rolls and she said she
05:11 - just heated one up in the microwave and
05:13 - it's amazing now I'm gonna be thinking
05:17 - about that during the whole stream all
05:22 - right so let's go to pull requests and
05:24 - here's pull request number three from
05:27 - Sebastian and let's check it out I love
05:30 - that REE factorization
05:34 - alright so usually I just kind of go
05:39 - through what was said it looks like this
05:42 - would be a small pull request only one
05:44 - file change so when I go through
05:46 - whatever the person who submitted the
05:48 - request says then I check out the files
05:52 - just in general it's easier to merge in
05:56 - a smaller pull request
05:57 - I appreciate pool requests of all sizes
06:00 - but occasionally if I get a really big
06:03 - pull request if I like 75% of it you
06:07 - know it's awesome but there's 25% that
06:09 - I'm not sure about sometimes like I
06:12 - don't really want to pull the entire
06:14 - thing in so if it was broken up into
06:16 - smaller requests I could just pull in
06:19 - what I need so keep that in mind I when
06:22 - you're submitting to really any
06:24 - repositories is I think you have a
06:26 - better shot at getting your pull request
06:27 - merged if it's smaller and more focused
06:31 - because it's less likely to cause merge
06:33 - conflicts and you know take the the
06:37 - repository maintainer a really long time
06:39 - to go through ok so this is in the post
06:44 - preview and let's see what's changed
06:46 - it's it's just a refactor so it should
06:48 - still have the same functionality looks
06:53 - like
07:02 - it looks like it's just cleaned
07:04 - everything up and made it and they did a
07:09 - bit smaller here so that looks good
07:12 - actually this is straightforward enough
07:15 - that I could just merge it right here
07:16 - but since we're kind of demonstrating
07:19 - this I'd like to show you how I would go
07:23 - about testing it so let's go go back to
07:28 - the terminal and make this a bit bigger
07:30 - so on a very small pull request like
07:32 - this where I could very clearly see all
07:34 - the lines of code I would probably just
07:37 - merge it right there in github because I
07:40 - mean it's just so obvious what that code
07:42 - does but if it's bigger and I really
07:46 - want to test it out first then I'll go
07:48 - into my my project so let's see if I
07:58 - need and Xcode whenever you install an
08:08 - Xcode update it always messes things up
08:15 - you have not agreed you must agree to
08:17 - both hit the enter key
08:30 - alright agree
08:37 - all right awesome okay so if anybody
08:41 - ever read that whole thing I have never
08:43 - read it that's not even in English I
08:50 - guess it's not really that long right
08:53 - it's anyway all right so I'm just
08:57 - checking the status to make sure we
08:59 - don't have anything that's uncommitted
09:00 - that on this branch so we don't and then
09:04 - now I'm gonna go get fetch origin and
09:10 - [Applause]
09:11 - the origin pool and then I'm gonna put
09:16 - the number of the pool request which in
09:17 - this case is three and then now I'm
09:20 - going to name this last part after the
09:23 - colon is what I'll name the branch so
09:26 - I'm just gonna say s refactor I'm just
09:32 - saying s refactor because it's Sebastian
09:34 - and so far there's only one person whose
09:37 - name starts with s this submitted pool
09:39 - request if I had more people I would
09:42 - probably come up with something better
09:44 - now I got to do this again since I
09:46 - restarted all right so let's on my other
09:50 - screen I'm gonna get my my key let's see
09:57 - so I don't know this offhand I have it
10:00 - saved in LastPass
10:17 - okay let's put that in there and then
10:21 - I'm gonna do SSH ad and that way it
10:28 - won't keep asking me for it so if you
10:30 - ever if you have this happen and you
10:32 - have to keep putting in your your
10:35 - passphrase just do run SSH ad and then
10:39 - put your passphrase in and it'll stay in
10:41 - there for me it stays in there until I
10:44 - restart I'm not there's probably some
10:47 - way to make it stay in there all the
10:48 - time but maybe it's better if you don't
10:51 - have to stay in there all the time just
10:52 - in case somebody gets into your computer
10:56 - okay so now let's go with I guess it
11:03 - already works so now we'll go get
11:05 - checkout yes refactor okay so now we
11:09 - have that pull request number three
11:13 - locally on our machine and we can test
11:16 - it out now at this point you'd want to
11:20 - remember if any packages have been added
11:22 - then you'd want to update so you just
11:24 - run yarn or you know or if you're using
11:26 - NPM you could do that but we don't have
11:30 - any new packages added so now we're just
11:33 - going to check it out see see what it
11:35 - looks like
11:35 - since this didn't add any new features
11:37 - it should be fine basically what I'm
11:40 - looking for
11:42 - let's see why this is not loading
11:46 - that work my sweet it's gonna be code
11:54 - make sure I save
12:05 - that's interesting I should be working
12:10 - let's go to need that oh this is where
12:16 - it's at you know just make sure the
12:26 - sights okay so the site is is up let's
12:33 - go let's go to the admin panel and see
12:38 - what's going on all right so we have
12:45 - graph QL I did go back to the older
12:49 - version oops
12:51 - and I just remembered I forgot to set my
12:53 - timer so I'm just gonna keep an eye on
12:55 - this probably once once we get close to
12:58 - 3 o'clock I'll take a five-minute break
13:01 - and we'll do some question-and-answer
13:03 - stuff so if you're asking questions
13:05 - right now I'm not I'm gonna get to it
13:08 - probably in about 10 to 15 minutes I'll
13:11 - check the live chat and get to the
13:12 - questions ok oh ok so Blake says it's it
13:20 - is working on end grukk ok let me try
13:26 - that out then wow it is ok so I'm not
13:37 - sure what the problem is locally okay so
13:43 - for now I'm just gonna look here just to
13:45 - test it out and then we'll worry about
13:47 - whatever is going on locally in a minute
13:50 - so I'm just going to go in and click we
13:54 - only have a few views available
13:56 - basically I'm just when I test out at
14:00 - this point it's really simple we don't
14:02 - have any testing setup so when I want to
14:05 - test it out I go through and just check
14:07 - you know the views and see if we're
14:10 - getting errors and
14:15 - so we are we are getting some errors but
14:20 - I doubt that this is related to the the
14:24 - pool request we can double check by
14:25 - going back to master and see if it's
14:27 - still there okay let's see see if we get
14:37 - this error everywhere this is actually
14:47 - we went that wasn't the right one that
14:48 - was still the local okay so something's
14:54 - wrong with my local host and then this
14:59 - okay great
15:00 - so this works without any errors here
15:03 - and grout so so that's cool now at this
15:08 - point we could merge from the command
15:16 - line and if I would do that normally I
15:19 - would merge in the master branch into
15:23 - this pull request branch first test it
15:27 - out again and then merge everything in
15:29 - the master but I think let's let's check
15:33 - and see and github if we can merge this
15:35 - without any without any conflicts okay
15:43 - so no conflicts so what I'm gonna do is
15:44 - just merge right here because it's it's
15:47 - easier to just press that big green
15:49 - button so like I said I would only do
15:54 - this on a very small pool requests where
15:57 - you can see what's changed and it's very
15:59 - it's obvious otherwise would definitely
16:02 - test and merge from the command line and
16:06 - let's confirm that all right also
16:18 - so
16:24 - I know Sebastian is watching right now
16:26 - but I still like to say thank you to
16:29 - everyone that submits a pull request so
16:31 - thanks Sebastian and also yeah I'm okay
16:38 - with this so Sebastian is asking if I'm
16:41 - okay with it and is to start refactoring
16:43 - the other components yeah I think this
16:46 - is that's awesome let's go it was
16:51 - let me check again post preview that was
16:53 - it yes in the post preview it looks
16:58 - great
17:02 - oops
17:03 - I didn't actually pull it down haha it's
17:07 - gonna look even better so let's go get
17:10 - check out the master get pull to bring
17:18 - in those changes alright so now we have
17:20 - that locally now let's check out those
17:22 - preview ok here's a perspi oh actually
17:33 - no it was the same thing because we
17:35 - weren't on the master branch
17:36 - nevermind I don't know what I was
17:38 - thinking okay so anyway so Sebastian
17:42 - that looks great if you want to refactor
17:45 - some of the other components then that
17:47 - would be awesome too yeah so
17:58 - yeah let's do take another like five or
18:02 - six minutes to do some some more styling
18:06 - and then we'll do a question and answer
18:14 - okay let me let's go back here actually
18:23 - first what we should do is get this
18:25 - working I could just run off the end
18:28 - Rock one I guess so I'm gonna give it
18:30 - maybe like two minutes to try to figure
18:32 - this out if we can't I'll just do
18:33 - everything off the end rock but I would
18:36 - like to see why because yesterday this
18:38 - was working fine so what are we getting
18:43 - here
19:26 - okay
19:29 - see if we're getting okay
19:39 - syntax error
20:15 - mmm
20:22 - check
20:37 - okay
20:40 - I think I'm probably not gonna mess with
20:41 - this during the stream I'm just going to
20:43 - do one last thing and that is restart
20:48 - the server because sometimes that just
20:50 - works so it's worth a shot I don't
20:53 - really think it'll work in this case but
20:55 - it only takes a few seconds all right
21:00 - hey and it works ha ha I can't believe
21:05 - it all right let's just read this way
21:09 - twice all right get out of here let me
21:13 - pull the one that works over so for some
21:19 - reason it just didn't work in that tab I
21:23 - don't know what's going on come on going
21:29 - in it it won't come up there all right
21:44 - are you serious
21:50 - so I can get I can get local hose to
21:54 - work in other tabs but I can't get it to
22:02 - work here that's insane
22:12 - that's so crazy I mean watch this
22:21 - what what would cause that that it will
22:25 - work here and not here
22:34 - all right well this is not a debug
22:37 - Chrome stream so I'm not gonna mess with
22:41 - it there we go so I did a hard refresh
22:54 - and it worked so I'm I don't know what
22:58 - whatever it works let's just keep going
23:01 - oh there we go
23:07 - Blake and put in the live chat cache and
23:10 - I didn't see it yet so yeah honestly
23:12 - this those two things probably solve
23:15 - more problems restarting the server and
23:19 - clearing the cache oh wow I'm just glad
23:24 - it works okay so now now let's take a
23:30 - five-minute break and do questions since
23:32 - I just took up the last five minutes
23:36 - just getting that to work so I'm gonna
23:40 - bring over my timer and we're gonna do a
23:45 - five minute break I'm gonna go through
23:47 - the latch and then we'll do another
23:48 - twenty five minutes of well we're legit
23:54 - gonna do some some styling I have now
23:58 - haven't really done much so far but I
24:02 - think it was worthwhile to go through
24:03 - the pull request process so I mean if
24:05 - you've never hosted your own repository
24:07 - where people were so many pull requests
24:09 - then you may you may not have gone
24:11 - through that before okay
24:30 - okay cool so Sebastian says in regard to
24:34 - the pull request as I read something
24:35 - about the previous pull request he had
24:37 - issues with the new JavaScript syntax or
24:38 - something I wanted to test with just a
24:41 - file if everything's okay I'll do more
24:43 - okay awesome you know did something
24:47 - weird with an on click hand earlier I
24:49 - just use the link the read more button
24:57 - okay so Sebastian is interested to see
24:58 - about what happens with the read more
25:00 - button yeah definitely works so yeah I
25:05 - mean if we're using react router then I
25:07 - think link is the way to go with that so
25:11 - it's good of that post detail was that
25:15 - the one now was it post preview that was
25:18 - it yeah so link I would think we would
25:23 - want to use link you know for every
25:26 - navigation so I don't have the the
25:31 - previous version to compare it to right
25:33 - now but that's that's what I would have
25:35 - done also in regard to that via the new
25:42 - JavaScript stuff so we do have because
25:45 - of the way we're using standard Jas
25:48 - sometimes when we have trying to find an
25:54 - example of functions okay so alright so
26:01 - like this we have render post so you get
26:04 - an error saying render post wasn't
26:07 - defined so harsh it when he submitted
26:09 - his full request number two did this
26:13 - right he defined them here in the
26:15 - constructor function but what I've been
26:18 - doing is instead not defining it in the
26:21 - constructor function so I'll just give
26:23 - an example now so we're gonna take this
26:25 - out and instead we're going to use an
26:32 - arrow function here
26:36 - that will handle the binding of this and
26:39 - then to handle the standard Jas
26:43 - complaining about it or whatever I mean
26:48 - es lense being used under the hood for
26:49 - that so I don't know exactly what it is
26:51 - that's giving the error message about it
26:56 - we're gonna go into our package JSON and
26:58 - then down here under our Global's I'm
27:01 - just I've been putting everything in
27:03 - Global's you can also do a similar thing
27:04 - right at the top of the file but it's
27:08 - just easy to put everything right here
27:10 - then you can see right at a glance all
27:11 - the stuff so you have to add a little
27:15 - bit either way you either have to put
27:16 - something in the component or you have
27:18 - to put something in here I kind of
27:19 - prefer to just put one line here if it
27:21 - got really huge we could probably take
27:23 - this out put it in another file if we
27:25 - wanted to but our package JSON is not
27:27 - very big at all so this works and then
27:30 - we save ourselves what was it like four
27:32 - lines in here inside the component so in
27:35 - here I would put render post and we'll
27:42 - say make sure you say both of those and
27:45 - let's go I'm just gonna run the Lintz so
27:53 - we can see we shouldn't get an error yep
27:58 - see it ran through everything we didn't
28:00 - get the error
28:09 - but now I'm not it's not loading again
28:20 - that's gonna be annoying okay I should
28:24 - have the cash off actually let's double
28:28 - check that in the settings
28:33 - [Music]
28:40 - see where there should be an option to
28:43 - disable caching when dev tools is open
28:49 - yep disable cache so that's on so I'm
28:53 - not sure what's going on with that we
28:55 - may just have to do a couple of hard
28:57 - refreshes okay hopefully that cleared up
29:04 - the whole issue with the air is coming
29:09 - from senator Chaz let's see kazeem sorry
29:18 - if I'm mispronouncing name it's qaz I am
29:21 - so I'm going to say Kazim says hi from
29:23 - Kosovo hey how's it going thanks for
29:27 - watching and joining in the live chat
29:30 - and my five minutes is up so I didn't
29:35 - get through everything this in a live
29:36 - chat right now but I will come back to
29:39 - where I left off and after the next
29:44 - Pomodoro session we'll do some more
29:46 - questions
29:56 - okay
30:07 - so let's go
30:13 - you know what let's add in let's make
30:17 - this actually you know drop down with
30:19 - some options and we'll add in a few
30:22 - other of the icons that we need here and
30:26 - I kind of I like to work my way like
30:29 - from the top down so we'll get this app
30:32 - bar you know kind of how we want it and
30:36 - also actually I think we'll go with the
30:40 - newer style that we've been doing on the
30:42 - last project the last couple of projects
30:46 - where you have the white with the gold
30:48 - underneath so my boss really likes that
30:51 - looks clean so let's do that so we'll
30:55 - change up some of the styles here add
30:56 - some icons add a drop down and then
30:59 - we'll throw in probably a logo here in
31:02 - the sidebar and yeah and then we'll see
31:07 - how long that takes you know we might
31:09 - not even get all that done but if it if
31:12 - we can get all that done then maybe
31:14 - we'll work on more on this sidebar ok so
31:19 - let's go into our our theme right so
31:24 - yesterday we set up a material UI theme
31:27 - and I believe that was in our layout yes
31:33 - so in our layout we actually have so
31:37 - we've brought in part of the theme here
31:40 - so see how we want to do this
31:48 - I don't know that I I obviously don't
31:50 - want to make our primary color white so
31:52 - what I'll do then is override our
31:55 - primary color just for that that app bar
31:59 - so let's for app bar
32:04 - let's go with
32:11 - background-color and we'll use oops what
32:20 - is white FFF yeah it's amazing how light
32:26 - you use the thing so many times and you
32:28 - know occasionally you're just you're
32:30 - just not sure about it okay all right so
32:34 - that will give us our white so if you're
32:36 - falling along with an grok you'll see
32:38 - that the whites right there I have a
32:40 - second window of this open on my other
32:43 - screen so I won't have to flip back and
32:45 - forth quite as much so we have that and
32:49 - now we want to do a bottom border so
32:56 - border
33:11 - so you want to do Solid 3 pixels I think
33:17 - we were doing three pixels for that
33:18 - bottom border we can double check at
33:21 - some point but I think three will work
33:23 - and we want our color to be let me I
33:29 - can't remember it offhand we'll have to
33:31 - grab it from an existing project so I'm
33:41 - opening up our resource center project
33:43 - on the other screen just so that I can
33:44 - grab this this color and it was it was
33:56 - three pixels so that's good
34:01 - be consistent there okay so we should
34:08 - see
34:15 - oops I forgot my a comma
34:24 - okay cool so let's see so right now you
34:27 - can see we have white with our gold
34:30 - underneath okay so we're going to want
34:32 - to change our color of our icons and
34:38 - let's see
35:00 - let's see if we can just put a color
35:02 - property on the app bar
35:04 - it might work might not be specific
35:08 - enough but if it works and that'll be
35:11 - great color and so let's do the CL that
35:22 - works
35:23 - whoops did I forget a comma again oh man
35:28 - I've been forgetting commas frequently
35:31 - lately alright great so that that wall
35:35 - that at least works for this so we still
35:37 - need that icon to have the color but
35:40 - that's good that it worked here and
35:45 - while we're at it I think I want to
35:48 - change I definitely want this to be a
35:52 - smaller font weight and perhaps just a
35:57 - little bit bigger so let's change that
36:02 - let's go ahead we can leave all those
36:05 - really small changes for another time
36:09 - let's get this what did we say that
36:15 - those feet with that icon was called was
36:17 - it more vert I think that's what it was
36:19 - let's get that more vert icon with the
36:23 - right color there so I don't think we
36:25 - have anything for an icon in here let's
36:30 - see where we're actually putting that
36:31 - icon in I don't remember plotting
36:34 - anything okay that's interesting color
36:41 - contrast
36:44 - I wonder actually I kind of want to look
36:47 - up what what it does there with color
36:51 - contrast so let's check the material
36:53 - design documentation or outside material
36:55 - UI so we are using the version 1 and
37:03 - let's go to icons let me make this a bit
37:12 - bigger for everyone okay
37:14 - icons it's just not there then we get
37:21 - icon somewhere there we go icons
37:29 - what was that icon button
37:39 - now let's see what they have here
37:49 - let's try let's check out the button
37:53 - component then since we're actually
37:55 - using an icon button component it may be
37:59 - here under buttons icon button here we
38:06 - are okay so this icon button this button
38:14 - color
38:15 - okay so color contrast alright let's see
38:23 - our API is so color color is using the
38:31 - theme palette when that makes sense
38:33 - oh okay so it's so somewhere in the
38:38 - theme we define what the contrast color
38:41 - is and then it's going to use that
38:43 - okay so if we reset this to primary it
38:47 - should pull that green color which is
38:49 - what we want so let's do that then
39:00 - so I mean we definitely could have just
39:01 - overrode this dial and it would have
39:04 - been a lot faster but I mean just I
39:07 - think it's nice to work within you know
39:10 - the way that the people who design
39:12 - material you I you know set that out to
39:15 - work it'll be a lot more consistent that
39:17 - way later on if we decided to change our
39:19 - primary color this would automatically
39:20 - change the correspond to it which is
39:23 - kind of nice probably not going to
39:24 - change it but it's nice to have it all
39:27 - linked up like that so you can see now
39:28 - we have our icon and let's see
39:35 - so now let's I'd really like to add the
39:40 - drop down I don't think I've used the
39:42 - drop down yet for material you I and any
39:44 - of our projects so this will be cool
39:48 - it'll be the first time to implement
39:50 - this on the stream so let's go to back
39:53 - to our documentation and let me see I
39:58 - forgot to reset my timer so I'm just
40:01 - gonna have to look again
40:05 - so we started this Pomodoro session
40:07 - around 3:00 so around 325 I just have to
40:11 - keep an eye on it okay so where's I just
40:21 - have to figure out what it's called here
40:23 - and may not be called a drop-down
40:29 - maybe menu concealer whoops
40:36 - actually want the demo first so we can
40:39 - see it and you yeah that's what I want
40:45 - okay so it's I'm just calling it a
40:47 - drop-down but it's it's really a menu so
40:49 - there we go this is we won't need all
40:51 - these options but that's kind of what
40:53 - I'm going for when you click on this
40:55 - then we give it so let's just go with
40:57 - the simple example and so we're going to
41:03 - need to grab import this and let's see
41:15 - menu item to me okay we are importing
41:18 - that as well great so let's do that in
41:21 - our in our layout because this is where
41:24 - we have that app bar so at the top let's
41:28 - pull in that menu oops oh man let me
41:36 - move this over
41:37 - I'm accidentally clicking my mini-map
41:39 - over here that's what sent me down there
41:42 - okay so let's do that and now right
41:46 - below we put it right here below the
41:50 - icon button oops or this icon button
41:56 - that way we'll keep them together I'm
41:58 - gonna be easier to tell you know what
42:01 - which is which here I probably could
42:03 - break it out into another component you
42:06 - know this whole thing but for now we'll
42:09 - leave it in there can always refactor
42:10 - later on let's see here it is here's a
42:15 - menu so I'm gonna copy this all in and
42:20 - we'll have to change it a bit looks like
42:24 - we're gonna have to copy in this as well
42:32 - okay so here's a menu
42:47 - okay let's pull this in
42:59 - [Music]
43:01 - yes
43:32 - saving needs need this button
43:41 - need our button to have these as well
43:45 - it's the icon button it's gonna have a
43:52 - lot here so let's bring these down just
43:55 - to help us read it alright let's see if
44:02 - that's if that will work
44:06 - oops
44:08 - haha and these aren't defined so let's
44:11 - go ahead and put these in our
44:12 - package.json so what did we have is not
44:16 - the fun and handle click and the request
44:19 - closed now states should definitely be
44:22 - States at work we have it in our package
44:25 - JSON right yeah we have it in there mmm
44:28 - that's weird and just handle click
44:33 - whoops
44:38 - there we go and it was the other one
44:40 - handle requests close all right
44:47 - let's save that see if we get
44:55 - and that's uh
45:02 - what'd I miss oh oh actually you know
45:04 - what yeah that doesn't make sense
45:05 - because we weren't linting there that
45:08 - was just a normal air and it's an
45:12 - Oakland maybe I did I paste this in the
45:15 - wrong spot
45:18 - let me see
45:20 - yep all right thanks Sebastian it's I
45:23 - based into the wrong place
45:29 - what was I thinking
45:31 - yeah be kidding me
45:36 - Wow all right so we already have state
45:51 - so let's bring in shoot we're gonna have
45:55 - to change that so we don't want that to
45:57 - be open let's go open open menu and
46:02 - we'll change it down here to open menu
46:08 - and select all this there we go
46:18 - open menu all right there we go
46:25 - now let's bring this in
46:32 - let's see if we have okay doesn't look
46:39 - like we're repeating anything and then
46:41 - we also need to do within here I'm going
46:47 - to make sure we say open menu okay all
46:56 - right I think that should work now we
47:01 - would have had to have had that added
47:02 - this the package.json at some point
47:04 - anyway so hey look at that it works
47:07 - awesome okay cool
47:12 - so that wasn't too bad to to implement
47:14 - if I could just photo just pasted it
47:17 - into the right spot it would have been
47:18 - even easier all right awesome so that
47:21 - works we're not going to want all of
47:24 - these we're gonna keep logout and then
47:29 - actually let me I don't remember what
47:33 - other options should be there let me
47:36 - check the time so I don't pass up the
47:38 - next okay so maybe in about seven
47:43 - minutes or so we'll do our next question
47:44 - and answer session so if you got any
47:46 - questions in the live chat and I haven't
47:48 - responded I'm not ignoring you I would
47:51 - definitely get to it in the question
47:53 - answer session or at the end of the
47:54 - stream let's see I'm just
47:59 - double-checking here my other screen
48:01 - what I want in that menu what
48:14 - actually let me bring this over because
48:16 - I don't think I've shown how the login
48:18 - works so this is currently how the login
48:20 - works for the live version of the
48:21 - bulletin so if your if the login data is
48:29 - not saved in local storage it shows this
48:32 - screen so I can type and so I type in my
48:39 - email JY by Franciscan edu if I were to
48:42 - put in an email address that wasn't at
48:44 - Franciscan ddu it wouldn't let it go
48:47 - through so even if you did something
48:48 - with dev tools and let it go through it
48:51 - still wouldn't it wouldn't work so it
48:53 - checks on the client side and the server
48:55 - side so when I submit this I get a link
49:00 - sent to me so whoops that's not it
49:11 - chuna pull the link over on the screen
49:15 - there it is okay so I get this link and
49:24 - second display images alright so this
49:28 - link comes in if I click it then I'm
49:31 - signed in to the bulletin and then Oh
49:35 - Acts
49:37 - I guess I'd only had logout as the
49:38 - option right now all right well so I
49:45 - guess we can take out the other options
49:47 - for now and that lengthy you get is a
49:50 - it's a single-use link so once it's used
49:54 - once then you won't be able to log in
49:57 - again if you try to use it again you'll
49:58 - get an error message so that's the
50:01 - current login system which hopefully
50:04 - we're going to be changing that soon
50:06 - although it does work well as long as
50:08 - some users do clear out their local
50:11 - storage often so it doesn't work well
50:14 - for them but for people who don't do
50:16 - that
50:17 - it makes it really easy because you can
50:19 - basically you stay logged in for a year
50:22 - as long as you're not clearing anything
50:23 - out
50:25 - okay
50:38 - let me but I am to do this just so we
50:40 - can see my stuff again alright so let me
50:48 - take out right now our other menu items
50:52 - depending on how much time we have and
50:54 - what we want to do with this I would
50:56 - like to add in some menu items like
50:58 - profile or my account to allow users to
51:01 - customize their experience a little bit
51:04 - but since we're not we don't have
51:06 - anything like that right now just going
51:08 - to keep things clean in here and take
51:10 - them out it seems silly to have a menu
51:13 - like that for one item but it was it was
51:19 - kind of always intended to have more
51:21 - just haven't haven't really had time to
51:23 - come back to this project since it wants
51:25 - last year
51:28 - okay so let's add in let me check the
51:34 - current version of this so we want to
51:36 - add a printer icon and then kind of a
51:39 - grid icon and a search search icon
51:43 - so let's go I wonder we'll probably have
51:48 - to go to our icons to get the name so
51:57 - there we go alright so if you if you
52:00 - want material design style icons this is
52:03 - definitely the place to go material do
52:05 - slash icons you get all these icons here
52:09 - and you can get them in several
52:11 - different formats right now we have
52:13 - already imported these icons so we can
52:16 - use them in our project but if I hadn't
52:19 - imported them I you like to grab the the
52:21 - SVG code for them and just put it in
52:24 - line so let's look for the print icon
52:28 - first alright so here we have print and
52:31 - we can see you know we could grab the
52:34 - SVG the ping or we could pull it in as
52:37 - an icon font we can pull it in we can
52:40 - use different colors here we're going to
52:42 - change the color of that green that
52:43 - we've been using so that doesn't really
52:44 - matter you know if we were to grab the
52:49 - SVG doesn't matter by
52:51 - I just mean you know we can download the
52:53 - SVG
52:54 - and then open it up copy and paste the
52:57 - code right there in line into our
52:59 - project but for now I just wanted to
53:01 - make sure of the name so we should be
53:04 - able to just use print icon so let's
53:08 - grab our icon button and I'm gonna paste
53:15 - it and paste it in here I'm hoping that
53:20 - this goes to the left of our current
53:24 - that's more vert icon button we'll see
53:27 - not sure let's see for now let's get rid
53:36 - of these this will probably end up
53:40 - having will may end up putting a link
53:47 - component either inside the button or
53:50 - wrapping the button in the link
53:51 - component but for now we just want it to
53:54 - get we want it to show up so assuming we
53:59 - can just do prints since we already have
54:02 - color primary it should be the right
54:04 - color I'm gonna save that and let's
54:06 - check it out for an icon is not defined
54:11 - well I don't think we imported it up
54:13 - here revert icon actually can we there's
54:24 - got to be a better way to do this than
54:26 - importing them all these icons
54:28 - separately right oh well when maybe
54:33 - we'll figure that out at some point but
54:35 - you would think that you could just do
54:37 - something like this right and import
54:41 - from icons
54:50 - all right so let's try it now we're
54:52 - actually importing that first for an
54:55 - icon great alright awesome and that
54:58 - worked just like we wanted it to you
55:00 - know the print icon there as well so
55:04 - it's time to do another five-minute
55:06 - question answer and we can have all our
55:08 - icons there probably doesn't need quite
55:11 - so much space in between but that's
55:13 - something you know that's a little thing
55:15 - that we can adjust later on sometimes if
55:18 - you try to adjust at least for me in my
55:20 - experience if I try to adjust those
55:21 - little things early on they want to get
55:23 - more things on the page I end up wanting
55:25 - to adjust them again and it's better if
55:27 - I just hold off until I get like a
55:29 - clearer picture of the hole more things
55:32 - on the page then I then I end up
55:35 - adjusting once instead of multiple times
55:37 - throughout okay so let me go to my live
55:45 - chat and I'm gonna scroll up to the
55:47 - point where I left off and get through
55:49 - as much as I can in five minutes at the
55:51 - time yeah I think we'll go with three
55:53 - Pomodoro sessions so I know yesterday we
55:55 - didn't do quite as much coding as we
55:57 - normally do so we'll make up for it
55:59 - today by putting in an extra session and
56:02 - so we'll have a five-minute question
56:04 - answer now another 25 minutes of code
56:06 - and then afterwards we'll have a long
56:08 - question answer session where I can get
56:10 - to everything that's left over after
56:12 - these five minutes so let me bring out
56:15 - my timer I don't know where I put it
56:18 - and I got minimize that I did all right
56:24 - here we go okay
56:38 - okay so James asks how do I have to be
56:41 - are ok how skilled do I have to be to
56:43 - join these live streams actually it
56:48 - doesn't it really depends on kind of
56:52 - what you want so we we go over some some
56:57 - things that are like a whole different
56:59 - range of skills so sometimes we go over
57:02 - things that are more advanced sometimes
57:03 - we do things that that aren't really
57:05 - that advanced so depending on what we're
57:08 - working on for a particular stream it
57:10 - may be more useful to you if you know if
57:13 - you're at a lower skill level so it
57:15 - generally it's I like to have a mix of
57:18 - different skill levels watching and in
57:21 - the live chat and then that way the
57:23 - people who you know really skilled can
57:25 - help out can help me out and can help
57:27 - the other people in the live chat out
57:30 - with any issues that they're having and
57:32 - help to explain and I try to do my best
57:35 - to explain as them as I'm going along so
57:37 - if I'm not explaining well feel free to
57:40 - ask any questions so I may not look at
57:42 - the live chat during the code session so
57:45 - I at at one point where you're streaming
57:47 - I tried to go through the live chat all
57:50 - the time and it ended up that we just we
57:53 - didn't get a lot of code done at all so
57:55 - that's why I've kind of separated them
57:57 - out but I will get to your questions
57:59 - eventually but I mean if you it kind of
58:04 - depends on if you want if you want like
58:05 - a straight tutorial that really gets to
58:07 - the point this is probably not the best
58:09 - place for that because you know we're
58:12 - always working on something different
58:14 - and it's it's not really methodical and
58:18 - how we teach things so it's more just to
58:21 - show like here's what my normal day is
58:23 - as a front-end developer but I do try
58:26 - try to do my best to explain things so
58:29 - you could get something out of it see
58:34 - Sebastian says with react 16 you can use
58:37 - class instead of class name right okay
58:43 - and Melissa says yes that's cool I
58:45 - hadn't I didn't realize you could do
58:47 - that
58:48 - I actually just read through some react
58:50 - 16 stuff before the stream today it
58:55 - looks like there's a lot that changed
58:57 - behind the scenes that make it faster
58:59 - and neck and smaller so that's pretty
59:02 - awesome
59:25 - okay James says can you do a beginning
59:29 - code that lined up the first project and
59:31 - free code camp yeah so yeah that one was
59:39 - the one so I started to do that one on
59:42 - my own channel so if you come in just in
59:46 - the free code camp channel it's I've
59:49 - already done a few streams at that point
59:52 - so you don't see you like the startup so
59:55 - check out I think I have linked in the
59:58 - description of this video the link to my
60:00 - channel my personal channel so if you
60:03 - check that out and you go to the project
60:06 - that is the title of the first video is
60:11 - building a website as fast as I can
60:15 - let's it ended up not being that fast
60:17 - but initially because of the deadline it
60:19 - was going to be really fast but gets on
60:22 - some leeway there so check that video up
60:25 - first if it's still not I don't remember
60:29 - exactly where I started out there but if
60:31 - it still needs like even more
60:33 - introduction I'm definitely open to
60:34 - going back maybe and you know kind of
60:37 - doing more of an introductory video on
60:40 - that but yeah check that one out I do
60:44 - maybe two or three streams on my own
60:46 - channel and then I switch over to freako
60:48 - cam
60:59 - okay John Hanson says had a hard time
61:01 - getting modal's to work as I would like
61:04 - and react even with react router looking
61:07 - forward to reworking modal's and react
61:09 - 16 awesome yeah so John have you been
61:16 - have you been using a framework like
61:18 - material UI or trying to do modal's from
61:20 - scratch because I think something like a
61:25 - framework it does make it pretty easy
61:55 - all right me let me mark down where I'm
62:00 - even off at and we'll do one more
62:02 - session of coding
62:21 - all right and I just saw right when I
62:23 - was working down the time so in us as
62:25 - hey what are you building a a Niles are
62:27 - going we are working on a react project
62:34 - with with graph Pio we're using Apollo
62:37 - to bring in stuff from graph qo and
62:38 - we're styling it today with the latest
62:41 - version of material UI ok alright so all
62:53 - right let's throw in those next there's
62:54 - two icons quickly since we know we know
63:00 - how to do it and it'll work so we just
63:02 - need to get the names of those icons so
63:05 - we want a grid not like that layouts see
63:21 - if it's in layout
63:25 - actually the me I'm gonna inspect the
63:31 - the current site that we're redoing and
63:35 - see if I use the material I con mathira
63:41 - khan grid button we call it a quilt is
63:51 - it huh wow it is called view quilt Wow
63:57 - I would not have guessed that okay so
63:59 - let's do the quilt and I'm just gonna
64:07 - I'm not gonna put it in twice now go get
64:10 - in there so let's do view quilts and
64:18 - down here
64:31 - let's figure out this and I'm gonna copy
64:34 - it twice in here since we know we're
64:36 - going to do another one and for this one
64:39 - we want the few quotes and I'll save
64:44 - that and then finally we want the search
64:47 - I'm almost positive search is just gonna
64:50 - be search so let's just try that out
64:52 - before we look it up search I'll go up
64:58 - to the top
65:17 - all right let's check it out awesome so
65:20 - we have our icons here great cool all
65:27 - right so let's move on and try to put
65:28 - the logo up in this corner I think so by
65:34 - default this is gonna be open so on it
65:38 - on a large screen let's see it look
65:40 - pointed okay so we actually don't have
65:44 - it we're gonna have to change this so
65:47 - that it's not always open because on a
65:49 - mobile that just doesn't give us enough
65:50 - room but so we may be able to display
65:55 - the logo on mobile I'm okay actually
65:58 - with not like you know let's say this is
66:00 - closed we go to a small screen and we
66:03 - just have something like this of course
66:04 - we'd want this text to be over here but
66:08 - I'm okay with not having the logo appear
66:10 - immediately and instead it appears when
66:14 - you click this oops
66:15 - and it looks like we need to change the
66:17 - color of this as well I've forgotten
66:19 - about that icon there should be a
66:20 - hamburger menu icon here but it's it's
66:22 - white so let's change that right now
66:25 - before you forget so anyway I think a
66:30 - logo right here will work let's change
66:35 - that color though so if we go down our
66:42 - icon button instead of contrast we want
66:46 - to give it the color primary which we if
66:49 - you remember from before we set that
66:50 - primary color as our green so now yep
66:56 - there we go so now we have that icon
67:00 - awesome all right so let's check out
67:03 - this sidebar component and see if
67:05 - there's some way to put a logo up here
67:09 - already built-in if not you know we'll
67:12 - have to make it work so where's my
67:16 - documentation I don't think we need
67:19 - these icons anymore so
67:23 - see the drawer see what we called that
67:29 - component yeah okay it is a drawer using
67:36 - a persistent drawer
67:38 - awesome
67:44 - okay so I don't see yeah I don't see any
67:49 - example with something up here let's
67:55 - check out the drawer API and see if
67:57 - there's anything anything that we could
68:01 - use
68:10 - okay so let's see anything so let's look
68:13 - in here and see if we can figure
68:16 - something out so classes from your
68:20 - header okay so here's our drawer header
68:23 - that's where we would want to put it so
68:24 - far we do have an icon button here we do
68:27 - want to keep that so let's try to put in
68:30 - an image into here and need to bring in
68:37 - I don't think we have a folder yet for
68:40 - images so for now
68:50 - I'm going to grab the image address from
68:55 - another site that Resource Center site
68:57 - so eventually we'll want to actually
69:00 - bring in the image but for now this will
69:01 - let us test it out quickly so there may
69:08 - see is there an image I don't know if
69:15 - there's an image component built into
69:20 - media built into material UI alright I
69:27 - don't see one so we'll just go with a
69:31 - regular image alright so this at least
69:40 - will give us something to work with for
69:41 - now to see what it looks like
69:51 - right now hmm
69:59 - there we go okay so we have the image in
70:04 - there right now it's way too big again
70:05 - it's covering up our our icon to close
70:09 - this so definitely need some work we can
70:12 - do a little bit of that right here in
70:14 - dev tools just make this a bit smaller
70:25 - and let's work on dev tools
70:35 - see where sidebar is there we go okay so
70:44 - let's give this see if we could do with
70:49 - percent so that's a little bit better we
70:53 - want to give it let's give it a margin
70:59 - 16 pixels it's let's increase it a bit I
71:03 - want to see I want to see where that
71:07 - button went to all right interesting so
71:13 - maybe if we switch the order it may work
71:18 - out a little better for us with that
71:20 - button
71:29 - we could try
71:34 - let's let's try I'd rather not mess with
71:38 - this button as much because you know
71:39 - everything's set from within the mature
71:42 - UI theme for that so instead let's let's
71:45 - try to position this in a way that will
71:48 - allow this button to do this thing
71:51 - normally what I'm thinking is if we go
71:55 - and do something like this
72:00 - well now it's messing up everything I
72:03 - didn't think about these ones down here
72:06 - [Music]
72:15 - all right so that might not be an option
72:17 - and keep that in mind though but then
72:19 - we'd have to position things these down
72:21 - further so for now it's not really an
72:26 - option let's see if we do
72:35 - if you can use flex
72:39 - one simply does for us nothing
72:50 - yeah let me switch the order then
73:10 - oops and I did not add my styles on this
73:14 - so good thing we didn't have too much
73:16 - going on all right so to shrink it down
73:23 - okay so this is giving us something a
73:25 - little bit more like what I wanted at
73:28 - least this button is visible and it's in
73:30 - the right spot
73:36 - I'm guessing what we'll probably want is
73:38 - for this to be up a little bit further
73:41 - so we don't have to move the logo down
73:43 - quite so far yeah under if we
74:09 - it's gonna check the live chat quickly
74:12 - as well to see if anyone has any
74:15 - solution actually image tag before the
74:17 - button saying okay cool just receive
74:19 - anyone had any thoughts on this
74:28 - okay
74:37 - nice image
74:58 - let's see I do I want to check before I
75:02 - start messing with this button too much
75:03 - I want to check the API for the button
75:06 - and see what we can do through the API
75:08 - otherwise we'll just have to override
75:11 - some stuff which is okay so
76:01 - okay so we can not but you know I don't
76:05 - want to override all the buttons so I'm
76:06 - not going to do it like this we'll just
76:08 - do it in line on that particular button
76:10 - so let's try some things out here in dev
76:14 - tools you check my time okay
76:18 - yeah we try some things out in dev tools
76:20 - see what we can do
76:44 - actually position:absolute might not be
76:47 - this might not be bad for this we can
76:55 - just put a margin on the image what do
77:03 - we do before 16 yeah we definitely need
77:05 - it to be a bit more than that okay we'll
77:11 - see Outlook I'm actually not now that I
77:13 - see this I don't like all the space on
77:15 - the top but give it a shot for now and
77:18 - let's see why do we have all this space
77:30 - anyway that's good
77:35 - interesting
77:41 - I really don't like that what do you all
77:43 - think I'm not I'm not a fan of this does
77:48 - not look good to me
78:02 - okay you know what yeah if you're if
78:05 - you're checking this out through and
78:07 - Rock you won't see any of this right now
78:09 - because I'm just doing this in dev tools
78:17 - yes so that's not I guess the the
78:24 - alternative is to not potentially if you
78:29 - don't have to give users the option to
78:31 - close this currently there is no option
78:33 - to close this on the the version that's
78:35 - live right now I'm usually all for
78:40 - giving users as many options as possible
78:43 - but in this case it's something that the
78:49 - users can't do now and I haven't had any
78:51 - any requests for it so an on mobile it
78:58 - would open and then you would simply
79:00 - have to click outside of it to get it to
79:02 - close so you know you hit the icon for
79:05 - it to open so how about I'd say for now
79:13 - let's just take this out or we could
79:17 - have even commented out just so that we
79:19 - don't forget that it's there
79:22 - maybe we'll comment it out and then
79:24 - we'll come back to it later on if we
79:26 - have time because I think that's that
79:29 - falls into the category of something
79:31 - that would be a nice feature but it's
79:32 - certainly not a necessary feature and
79:36 - especially since I've I've never had a
79:40 - request from a user to be able to do
79:42 - this I think probably it's it's not
79:46 - necessarily worth the time to get this
79:48 - to work right now yeah so let's do that
79:52 - so I'm gonna do
80:06 - we do comments and reacts like this yep
80:12 - there we go
80:20 - there's not some better way to do
80:22 - comments and react right am i I don't to
80:27 - be that missing let's do this we don't
80:30 - take up quite as much space there we go
80:35 - alright so as far as I know that's the
80:38 - only way to do comments and reacts all
80:46 - right so let's say that we'll probably
80:49 - want to comma comment out the Chevron
80:55 - left up top here otherwise it'll
80:58 - probably tell us somewhere that we've
81:01 - imported this and we're not using it
81:18 - no I got it Judy are you really I don't
81:21 - know what's going on with this okay so
81:23 - now on our image let's go let's just add
81:30 - to this to these styles and let's do a
81:34 - logo styles and we can put with 100%
81:48 - whoops forget this is an object not
81:53 - normal CSS with a hundred percent and
81:56 - let's add some a set of margin I will do
82:02 - padding all the way around we'll give it
82:05 - eight pixels see how that looks but I
82:10 - think eight pixels will look alright we
82:12 - might want a little bit more maybe on
82:14 - the top we'll see oops and I forgot my
82:19 - comma and I forgot to tie it and who our
82:22 - component down here so let's find our
82:24 - image
82:33 - yeah it's gonna pass it up right there
82:38 - we go let's go to a style and what do
82:44 - you call that logo sis styles we did
82:52 - pull that in two styles right
82:59 - you'll find another spot where you use
83:01 - that
83:07 - just as Tyl he equals the only using it
83:14 - in one place all right well we can see
83:19 - if it'll work here nope it didn't
83:40 - and we're using this somewhere right
83:44 - classes flex okay
83:58 - this
84:02 - it's not really
84:30 - it's easy
84:33 - classes that
84:57 - wait a second what am I doing wrong
84:59 - class name clot that's it thank you
85:03 - Sebastian class name classes okay
85:16 - on my other my react native project I'm
85:18 - doing everything with the style tag so
85:20 - I'm saying style when I'm bringing in
85:23 - styles dot whatever that's what I kept
85:28 - trying to do and I don't have it set up
85:30 - like that for this okay not bad maybe oh
85:38 - yeah maybe
85:52 - didn't give it
86:03 - you
86:18 - so do we have if this side bar has a
86:21 - fixed width which it does all right
86:24 - let's try this 250
86:42 - two-fifty
86:52 - oops let's try 2 34 pixels okay that
87:14 - works
87:15 - the accomplice is basically the same
87:17 - thing so here's so basically what I did
87:20 - instead of doing with 100% which was not
87:25 - letting us get our our margins the way
87:28 - we wanted since this has a fixed width
87:32 - the sidebars are fixed with the 250
87:33 - pixels what we wanted was 8 pixels on
87:36 - each side so we just made the logo 234
87:39 - pixels which gave us that extra 16 for
87:42 - each side and then we had 8 pixels on
87:45 - the top and the bottom and then for
87:47 - right and left we set it to auto which
87:49 - splits it equally so that's how we got
87:52 - our positioning here so now we'll go
87:55 - back over and change this in the
87:57 - component so go back up to where we set
88:02 - our logo styles so you want to 34 pixels
88:08 - and 8 pixels of Auto
88:21 - and
88:24 - okay actually that's we're not getting
88:30 - our eight pixels on the top and the
88:32 - bottom will just happen oh oh I didn't I
88:35 - had switched it to margin let's see if
88:42 - that makes a difference
88:47 - yep it does okay great all right not bad
88:51 - and my timer went off so it's just in
88:54 - time we got that that done so we have
88:56 - our whole top portion pretty much done
88:59 - I'd like to make a few little little
89:01 - changes here and there really minor
89:04 - things so next up will be getting the
89:07 - rest of this sidebar looking like it's
89:08 - supposed to and then when we want to
89:12 - building out some of the views okay so
89:18 - let me actually I want to commit this
89:22 - now because I I've been forgetting to
89:24 - commit and later on so I don't want
89:26 - anybody even wants to maybe work on this
89:28 - to have you know the older version of
89:31 - the code so let's check our status see
89:34 - what's changed okay this looks good
89:37 - these are the things that we we did
89:39 - actually changed so let's go get commit
89:44 - we're gonna add the am flag which means
89:47 - adds we're gonna add all those files
89:48 - then we're also going to put in a commit
89:51 - message at the same time in line with
89:53 - our command so let's say icons
90:06 - okay that works and then we're gonna get
90:13 - push origin master to push that up to
90:15 - github it's going to do all its most
90:18 - Auto formatting checks and everything
90:23 - wait did it do all for money
90:39 - that was weird
90:45 - for some reason it wasn't automatically
90:49 - running that so I'm not sure what's
90:51 - going on with that so I guess I'll do
90:59 - another commit
91:09 - okay
91:15 - yeah it didn't do the normal lifting all
91:21 - right so that's all up in the github
91:23 - repo so everything that we've done is
91:25 - available now the link to the repo is in
91:27 - the description so now I'm gonna scroll
91:33 - back up to where I left off in the live
91:35 - chat so if you can't stick around for
91:38 - the live chat thank you so much for
91:39 - watching I'll be back tomorrow sometime
91:41 - around 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time
91:44 - but if you can stick around definitely I
91:49 - hope you can and help out with answering
91:52 - questions or asking some of your
91:53 - questions I am gonna try to get through
91:57 - all the questions I do I have an
92:00 - appointment at 5:00 so it probably can
92:03 - I'm probably safe to go at least a half
92:06 - hour with questions and so we'll see
92:09 - hopefully I can get through everything
92:11 - normally not only able to okay
92:21 - see
92:26 - James says he just seems to want to
92:29 - impress someone and not here to help out
92:31 - what are these projects based upon
92:33 - anyway I'm not sure is James James might
92:37 - be talking about me I don't see him
92:39 - talking about anybody else so anyway
92:43 - yeah James I don't know so I'm not sure
92:49 - how much you've seen but it's actually a
92:52 - probably the opposite I don't know that
92:54 - I impress that many people with this I
92:56 - frequently mess up and make mistakes
92:58 - that's kind of the whole point is for
92:59 - people to see someone who is employed
93:01 - full-time as a front-end developer
93:02 - making a lot of mistakes and trying to
93:05 - work through it so yeah so if I was out
93:09 - to impress I would not live stream I
93:11 - would record and edit out all of my
93:13 - mistakes usually the most impressive
93:18 - thing that happens in the stream or the
93:20 - pool request that you all submit it
93:22 - makes the projects so much better than I
93:24 - ever could have made them and the
93:28 - projects the projects are actually based
93:30 - upon my work project so I'm currently at
93:33 - my job and I work on whatever my boss
93:37 - says I need to work on so that's why we
93:41 - have a few projects going on at once and
93:43 - sometimes we switch projects depending
93:45 - on what's what's needed so that's what
93:49 - it's based on the styling is based on
93:51 - the style guide for the University of
93:53 - that work at so I have I do have quite a
93:56 - bit of freedom in the tools that I use
93:58 - but there are some things that I can't
94:00 - change so one of it being you know we've
94:03 - set the styles so I kind of have to
94:06 - stick with that you know I have some
94:09 - leeway with that but we couldn't just
94:11 - completely change and go with like an
94:13 - entirely different philosophy on design
94:17 - let's see James says do you know skills
94:23 - enough to explain to people how to
94:26 - adjust their issues that we have with
94:28 - coding I never seen a coding channel in
94:33 - a fashion such as this can you help us
94:35 - out
94:36 - I can definitely try to help you out so
94:38 - if you have any
94:39 - put them in the live chat and you can
94:45 - also ask me questions on other social
94:47 - media things so if you send me something
94:50 - on Twitter so my Twitter is linked in
94:52 - the description as well or really
94:53 - anything i have i've got messages on
94:55 - linkedin facebook twitter instagram
94:57 - through email any of those i'll try to
95:01 - get back to you as soon as i can i can't
95:03 - always get back right away because i you
95:05 - know i have a lot going on i have four
95:07 - kids and my job and I'm taking a Udacity
95:10 - daño degree course so I can't respond
95:13 - immediately but I do always try to get
95:15 - back to everyone eventually with some
95:17 - help or at least some helpful links as
95:21 - in regards to whether I have enough
95:24 - skills to explain to people I don't
95:27 - really know that's why I say in the live
95:29 - chat you know anybody who if you can
95:32 - stick around for the live chat even if
95:33 - you're an expert and don't have
95:35 - questions I definitely appreciate your
95:37 - sticking around and helping to answer
95:39 - questions because you know in this field
95:42 - even if I were an expert at something I
95:44 - can't be an expert at everything so
95:47 - they're always going to be questions
95:48 - about things that I don't I've never
95:50 - used before so when that happens you
95:54 - know I'm I'm fine with saying hey I
95:56 - don't really know you know does anybody
95:59 - else have any input so in terms of my
96:03 - skills I you know I don't know you all
96:06 - can can tell me I have I have had some a
96:10 - lot of positive feedback though that
96:12 - people say that I have helped out
96:15 - certainly in regard to someone who's
96:17 - just starting out I'm pretty confident
96:20 - in my CSS my HTML skills in terms of
96:23 - react you know I'm still going through
96:26 - and learning things I'm much much better
96:28 - than I was even you know six months ago
96:31 - so you know this show we're kind of all
96:34 - learning together and helping each other
96:36 - out so you know I'll do my best to give
96:39 - advice when I can but then also let you
96:43 - all know whenever I'm probably not the
96:45 - best resource so you know take take what
96:48 - I say for what it is
96:51 - let's see okay
96:59 - okay Paul says in response to James says
97:03 - he's far ahead not at the beginning
97:04 - level you can google on material UI and
97:06 - he's showing us how to style using
97:08 - material you eye components yeah so this
97:10 - this particular stream was not
97:12 - necessarily beginner level so you
97:15 - probably would have had to have some
97:17 - knowledge of how react works and maybe a
97:21 - little bit about material UI so this
97:23 - particular shame not maybe not really
97:26 - good for beginners maybe some of the
97:28 - later on we were just doing some basic
97:30 - you know positioning stuff with CSS it
97:33 - would be project three has some stuff
97:37 - that it's not react based it's more like
97:40 - just plain HTML and CSS we are dealing
97:42 - some with some c-sharp templates but I'm
97:46 - gonna do some things with project three
97:48 - to make it a lot more beginner friendly
97:50 - especially for beginners to submit pull
97:52 - requests so I've had some other stuff
97:54 - that I had to work on when I'm not
97:56 - streaming so I haven't been able to get
97:58 - that ready yet but hopefully I'll be
98:01 - finished up with with some updates I
98:03 - need to make to that project one that we
98:07 - had done and when I'm done with that
98:08 - maybe it'll free up a little bit more
98:10 - time for me and I can get that going so
98:12 - as we go back into project three from
98:15 - time to time that's probably the best
98:17 - place for beginners right now okay James
98:24 - says sorry for beating you up but I'm
98:25 - wanting to get my point across oh don't
98:27 - worry about it yeah definitely I any
98:32 - questions or comments or anything I
98:34 - definitely welcome even if it's
98:35 - criticism because I want to make these
98:37 - streams you know as good as they can be
98:39 - for you also don't feel bad about you
98:42 - know any any comments let's see James
98:46 - says well well think of us let's see he
98:50 - didn't say that when he first started
98:52 - making videos about coding okay I'm not
98:58 - sure what I would he said at that time
99:01 - or what I said at that time so see okay
99:06 - Sebastian says you know he will answer
99:08 - your question when she finishes yeah
99:09 - yeah so yeah so if I mention from time
99:19 - to time but if if you come into the
99:21 - stream in the middle of a session just
99:24 - just to let you all know I'm not
99:26 - ignoring the live chat so I do get to
99:29 - the questions but I have to space it out
99:31 - otherwise I just can't get coding done
99:35 - if I'm constantly going back and forth
99:37 - from questions to code so I've tried
99:39 - doing it like that and the streams end
99:41 - up being really long and we don't really
99:43 - get that much done so we kind of split
99:45 - out the the question answer session from
99:49 - that but we still do get to the
99:50 - questions
99:54 - see I Paul says it's a series just a
99:59 - demo of his talent on advanced topics so
100:02 - thank you for that Paul but I I don't I
100:05 - kind of gone with what I said before I
100:07 - don't know that this is a demo of my
100:09 - talent yeah so that the point is like
100:15 - and I know I've said this before but for
100:18 - anybody who's new that's watching I
100:20 - there are so many great people that are
100:23 - doing tutorials like free recorded
100:25 - tutorial videos and they're awesome but
100:29 - the thing that I thought might be
100:31 - helpful that I can help with I didn't
100:33 - really think I could compete with the
100:35 - people that are already doing great
100:36 - tutorials but I thought at least I can
100:39 - help new developers out by showing them
100:42 - what it's like for me as a full-time
100:45 - developer and just how many mistakes I
100:48 - make and how hard it is to work through
100:50 - because sorry I just realized I left my
100:53 - fan on so I apologize if the fan was
100:55 - kind of annoying to anybody I just
100:57 - turned it off so anyway I am I just
101:02 - thought it might be helpful for people
101:03 - to see like when you see the coding
101:05 - videos that are tutorials it seems like
101:07 - the people doing it are awesome they
101:09 - don't make any mistakes right which is
101:10 - fine for those videos because
101:12 - you want to get to the point you want to
101:14 - teach people so you don't want to leave
101:15 - in all mistakes but I thought it might
101:17 - be helpful for people to see that you
101:20 - know even someone who does have a
101:22 - full-time job as a programmer still
101:24 - makes those mistakes sometimes really
101:26 - silly mistakes I mean if you've if
101:28 - you've watched previous streams you know
101:30 - sometimes I just make you know
101:32 - ridiculous mistakes and it takes me
101:34 - forever to figure it out
101:36 - so anyway that's that's what I thought I
101:38 - brought to it so it's not it's not
101:40 - really me demonstrating my skills or
101:43 - anything like that if I do something
101:47 - awesome on the live stream then that's
101:49 - great that's really cool but I also
101:52 - think it's really cool when I mess
101:53 - something up on the live stream and that
101:55 - can be more helpful than me doing it
101:58 - right because you know then you'll see
102:01 - the mistakes that I make and you know
102:05 - you're kind of ahead of the game you
102:06 - won't make those same mistakes
102:07 - because you've already seen me do it and
102:09 - we've worked through it together I need
102:13 - to come up with like a really brief way
102:16 - to say that and just say it at the
102:17 - beginning of all the shows and maybe put
102:19 - it in the description because I think I
102:21 - say that frequently and maybe I'll like
102:25 - write it out and condense it as much as
102:27 - I can
102:29 - let's see
102:51 - Carlos says that comma issues should be
102:54 - caught by the linter Yellen set on well
102:57 - I thought I had it set on commit to lint
103:01 - but for some reason it wasn't it wasn't
103:05 - working right so but anyway yeah what I
103:08 - need to set things up so that it
103:11 - automatically does it as I'm typing okay
103:17 - cool set James says I'm on
103:18 - myfirstproject and free code camp so
103:20 - awesome James that's great starting out
103:24 - so yes so if you have any questions
103:29 - about any of the free code camp stuff
103:30 - let us know here in the lab chat or like
103:32 - I said you know on some other form of
103:36 - social media I'd be happy to help out if
103:39 - I can
103:42 - let's see James says can you build a
103:49 - dating website I would like to learn
103:51 - about that is that hard hard work yeah
103:58 - so well like I mentioned before since
104:00 - I'm doing these streams from work I
104:02 - really like I need to work on my work
104:04 - project so I work for University so I'm
104:08 - not going to be working on a dating
104:09 - website but it potentially some of the
104:13 - things that we work on here could be
104:15 - used for other projects I know some
104:17 - people have taken some of our previous
104:19 - projects clone the repo and then change
104:24 - things to make it work for their use
104:26 - case so that's possible too you could
104:29 - definitely build a website like that
104:31 - with react I don't know in terms of like
104:34 - the back end in the database we don't
104:36 - get into databases very much at all on
104:39 - this stream although we might in the
104:41 - future
104:42 - so there's definitely more to it than it
104:44 - would be in this stream but you know in
104:46 - terms of all the front end you know you
104:48 - could definitely learn enough to build
104:52 - out a front end for something like that
104:58 - Sebastien says so we were talking about
105:00 - this sign let this drop down menu and
105:02 - saying you know right now it really only
105:04 - has one option and so Sebastian says
105:08 - it's kind of pointless why not just have
105:10 - a logout button and you're right
105:12 - Sebastian so basically there were two
105:14 - reasons why I made it like this
105:15 - initially one is I intended to have more
105:18 - options there and I just never had time
105:21 - to put them in also I wasn't sure what
105:24 - the proper button is for logout that's
105:26 - kind of universally known so one of the
105:31 - requirements was this had to work for
105:33 - people who are not really that familiar
105:36 - with computers so I don't know I mean to
105:42 - be honest with you now that I think
105:43 - about it would people really know that
105:45 - this was a menu so if anyone has any
105:48 - ideas for an icon that would mean logout
105:51 - we can go with that but I really would
105:53 - like to have some other options here if
105:56 - we could to give users you know some
106:00 - some customization so we'll see
106:05 - hopefully for now I'm going to leave it
106:07 - in just because I hope to put more
106:09 - options here but if we get closer to the
106:11 - time when this is going to launch and we
106:12 - still don't have options then maybe
106:14 - we'll swap in some icon and we'll just
106:18 - put a tooltip over it so that people
106:21 - will know what it what it does let's see
106:39 - all right James says does anybody have
106:41 - the heart to help me with advice as a
106:44 - developer X I mean I think but going to
106:51 - free code camp is already a great kind
106:54 - of first step so if you work through the
106:56 - free code camp stuff and try to
106:59 - supplement that with maybe YouTube
107:01 - videos knotti not necessarily these
107:03 - streams but there's a lot of other great
107:05 - streams on free code camp and other
107:08 - YouTube channels so like all of on this
107:12 - channel like Bo's JavaScript videos are
107:15 - great great like intro to different
107:17 - things in JavaScript so when you get to
107:19 - that part in free code camp check those
107:21 - videos out also for like CSS stuff dev
107:27 - tips is a really good YouTube channel
107:29 - that I've gone to for a lot of more like
107:31 - design and CSS things for some more
107:34 - JavaScript stuff and build tools and
107:37 - things like that learn code Academy is a
107:40 - great JavaScript or a great YouTube
107:42 - channel that I've used before and then
107:45 - so there's a lot of different types of
107:48 - videos on the free code camp channel too
107:50 - so if you check out some of the
107:51 - playlists there's just a huge variety of
107:54 - content so I'm kind of I'm the only one
107:57 - that does like the day-to-day live
107:59 - streaming kind of thing but there's a
108:02 - lot of other really talented people that
108:04 - you do great tutorial videos and things
108:06 - so so definitely check those out if
108:09 - you're more the type of person that
108:10 - likes to learn by reading there's a book
108:13 - series it's you just called you don't
108:16 - know Jay s and that's actually for
108:18 - available for free on github so you can
108:20 - just read it online so check that out
108:23 - that's that's really good and my only
108:27 - other advice if you're new is like just
108:29 - keep working through it you're
108:30 - definitely gonna have some times I know
108:32 - I did where it just seems like I'm
108:34 - working on this problem and I just can't
108:35 - can't get through it but just don't give
108:39 - up keep on working and once you finally
108:42 - get through that problem you're gonna
108:43 - feel great and you're always gonna look
108:46 - back at you know where you were at a few
108:48 - months ago and just realize like
108:50 - I've come so far and that's pretty
108:52 - awesome feeling so for me at least it's
108:56 - definitely worth it you know to just
108:58 - keep going and keep trying to push
109:00 - through and and it's great if you have
109:02 - other people around so like this live
109:04 - chat is how we form kind of a little
109:07 - community here so you know if you need
109:11 - if you need some help or you just need
109:13 - somebody to say like you know hey keep
109:16 - going for it you can do it you know it's
109:18 - kind of cool to have a little community
109:19 - so it doesn't have to be this community
109:21 - for the live chat if you have some other
109:22 - people in your area you can meet with
109:24 - that's that would be amazing too but if
109:27 - anyone else has any advice please put it
109:29 - in the live chat and I'm sure some of
109:32 - you probably already have I haven't got
109:33 - to it yet let's see
109:51 - okay in US if I've ever used UJS and is
109:56 - it better than react I have never used
109:59 - UJS but I know some really good
110:01 - developers I don't mean no personally I
110:03 - mean like just through Twitter and stuff
110:05 - so I know some really good developers
110:07 - who loved UJS and have used both you and
110:11 - reacts so I don't really know I would
110:13 - view seems really promising and I think
110:18 - maybe one day I'd like to try it out I'm
110:21 - just really trying to get good with
110:23 - react at this point so I don't want to
110:25 - branch out right now I mean you know how
110:27 - it is you can know a little bit about a
110:29 - lot of things you can specialize and get
110:30 - really good at one thing so I'm kind of
110:33 - in specialization mode right now but if
110:36 - I get to the point where I feel kind of
110:37 - confident and want to branch out a bit I
110:40 - think I will definitely try view but
110:43 - until I try it I don't know that I
110:45 - really would have a great opinion on
110:47 - whether it's better than react I mean
110:49 - I'm happy with reacts so far I really
110:51 - like it but you know there's also a lot
110:56 - of people that like view so I'm sure
110:58 - it's good to see Samson says the hover
111:04 - menu completely hides the button yeah it
111:06 - does we could probably work on that if
111:09 - we do decide to keep the hover menu I
111:11 - mean it I guess it doesn't really matter
111:15 - that it hides the button because you you
111:17 - don't really need to click the button
111:18 - again but it might not be quite as weird
111:22 - if we push it down a bit and up we could
111:24 - probably do that this this loading thing
111:30 - is bothering me so I'm just refreshing
111:33 - let's see eric says react jess is the
111:38 - future I mean that it does definitely
111:41 - keeps growing so at least for the for
111:45 - the foreseeable future I don't think
111:47 - it's going anywhere anytime soon John
111:51 - Hansen says I'm a from scratch type of
111:53 - person I used to I'll be all about like
111:58 - trying to do things from scratch but I
112:00 - definitely appreciate some boilerplate
112:02 - now when I got to get a project done
112:04 - quickly you know that really helps but
112:09 - it is definitely good to know how to do
112:11 - everything from scratch and really
112:13 - understand you know what's what goes
112:15 - into you know setting things up Eric
112:22 - asked it has Adam gotten really buggy
112:24 - for you was thinking about switching
112:27 - back to visual studio code but want to
112:29 - stick with Adam actually Adam has gotten
112:31 - a little bit buggy so on this computer
112:34 - it's fine but on my laptop it's been
112:38 - really buggy lately I don't understand
112:40 - why I have the same plugins on both for
112:43 - the most part using the same version so
112:46 - I don't know I haven't really dug into
112:49 - the problem yet to see what's going on
112:51 - maybe I just have some outdated plug-in
112:54 - that I need to get rid of but yeah I'm
112:58 - not quite ready to switch completely to
112:59 - Visual Studio code but I have been using
113:01 - it some so we'll see I'm right now I'm
113:07 - still with Adam let's see
113:17 - all right I'm just going to try I think
113:19 - I'm gonna skip some of the comments to
113:23 - make sure I can get to all the questions
113:26 - so look at there's some discussion about
113:29 - Adam here
113:41 - see
113:52 - see Kim says normal HTML style comment
113:56 - works in and JSX
113:59 - okay cool okay cool innocence thank you
114:06 - it is a pretty useful stream awesome
114:08 - thanks for thanks for saying that I'm
114:11 - glad I'm glad it's useful to you okay
114:20 - Sebastian said this there's another live
114:22 - stream scheduled for free code camp a
114:24 - live workshop basics of JavaScript and
114:26 - es6 syntax
114:27 - I'm not witness is scheduled I'm not
114:30 - cutting into it right let's try to look
114:33 - for I didn't get a notification about it
114:36 - yet so hopefully it's not I'm not taking
114:41 - up their time
114:47 - Kiyoshi says what tips would you
114:49 - recommend a junior developer interested
114:51 - in getting a job and reacts so I would
114:58 - say build build things with react I mean
115:02 - that it sounds straightforward I know
115:04 - but that's like build things with react
115:06 - having a github if you're not already on
115:09 - github get a github profile and put code
115:11 - in there just get good ideas for
115:15 - different react projects so just think
115:18 - about something like an app or something
115:20 - that you think would be useful and make
115:22 - it get ideas from your friends and
115:24 - family and just do it so if you if you
115:28 - have the time like the free time to be
115:30 - able to do it that's great if you need
115:32 - to work and actually make money you know
115:35 - try to get some clients and make things
115:37 - and react even make things that don't
115:41 - necessarily need to be in react but just
115:43 - do it in react for the practice
115:45 - you like employers will want to see that
115:48 - you can actually do the work so they'll
115:49 - want to look at github they'll want to
115:52 - see demos of what you can do so that
115:56 - would be my biggest thing the other
115:58 - thing would be if you can't network so
116:01 - either online
116:01 - and so like on your social media
116:03 - accounts talk about being a developer
116:09 - talk about how much you like being a
116:11 - developer try to comment in a helpful
116:15 - way to to other developers especially on
116:19 - Twitter Twitter seems to be pretty big
116:20 - for you know for developers so because
116:25 - employers will look at that right if
116:27 - they see and they're really interested
116:28 - in you they'll check your social media
116:30 - stuff so you know if your social media
116:34 - is full of things entirely unrelated to
116:37 - development they might think you don't
116:38 - really care about it or if it's full of
116:42 - a lot of negative things about how much
116:45 - you hate you know this or that about
116:48 - JavaScript or something then they might
116:50 - think you're too negative of it so just
116:53 - keep that in mind that anything that you
116:55 - put online is public your employer would
116:57 - potentially see so just start kind of
116:59 - working on building up you know kind of
117:01 - your online presence as being someone
117:03 - who is positive and excited about being
117:06 - a developer and helping other developers
117:08 - so that's kind of that's my my advice to
117:14 - you I'm sure there's a lot of other
117:15 - things that you could do but for me I
117:18 - know when I've been involved in the
117:21 - hiring process for developers and I
117:23 - immediately want to look at their github
117:25 - repo and look at projects that they've
117:28 - worked on and check that out
117:30 - and then if I'm interested I will check
117:34 - out their social media and I'm more
117:38 - interested in that than their resume so
117:41 - I mean I do look at the resume but if
117:44 - someone has an amazing resume but they
117:46 - don't include a link to github and I
117:48 - can't find any of their code anywhere
117:49 - I'm not really interested
117:52 - maybe if no one else applies I would
117:55 - reach out to them but if there are other
117:57 - people with the less impressive resume
117:59 - but I actually see their stuff on github
118:00 - and it's good I'm much more likely to
118:02 - want to interview that person
118:12 - various says which Udacity nano degree
118:14 - are you taking I'm taking the react nano
118:16 - degree
118:17 - so I've there there are three projects
118:20 - for that nano degree I'm done with the
118:21 - first two I just need to do the last one
118:23 - which is react native app and then
118:27 - hopefully if I do the last one and it
118:29 - works and everything then they don't
118:31 - have my nano degree so I'm hoping to
118:35 - have all that done by the end of this
118:36 - month and when I get done with my my
118:41 - last project oh I'll show you all in the
118:44 - livestream if you want maybe during like
118:46 - one of the question-and-answer sessions
118:48 - give you a little little preview of it
118:53 - let's see she says in 2017 what should I
119:00 - learn to be a full sack developer I am
119:02 - fluent in front-end design HTML CSS
119:05 - bootstrap JavaScript what should I learn
119:08 - to become a full stack developer Vleck
119:13 - spirit says no js' yeah yeah for sure I
119:16 - recommend no js' it'll probably be
119:18 - easier for you to learn node since you
119:20 - already know javascript then to switch
119:21 - to a completely different language so it
119:24 - kind of depends it like really on what
119:26 - you want to work with but if you don't
119:28 - have any specific company or technology
119:31 - you want to work with and I'd go with
119:33 - node that'll probably the easiest
119:34 - transition as you should also ask about
119:39 - the database vole expert recommends
119:41 -  DB is popular with node yeah I've
119:46 - heard great things about DB there
119:49 - are some really cool things people were
119:50 - doing with couch and pouch DB so check
119:53 - that out
119:54 - I've seen some some cool demos at
119:57 - conferences with that it couldn't hurt
120:01 - to learn a little bit about sequel based
120:04 - databases because you you're likely to
120:07 - end up at a company that uses sequel
120:10 - because it's it's definitely used more
120:13 - often than no sequel stuff so I try to
120:20 - be familiar with both
120:21 - with both types but if you want to
120:23 - specialize
120:25 - I said Mongoose does seem to be really
120:27 - popular with with node various says
120:32 - don't wait to be an expert to code start
120:35 - now yeah definitely yeah the only way
120:37 - you get better is just it's actually
120:38 - code just work your way through it
120:52 - okay so blake has a suggestion for the
120:55 - logout icon let's check it out
121:00 - serial icons and what was that called
121:08 - exit exit - okay we'll see what do you
121:15 - all think
121:16 - does this icon if you saw this icon
121:19 - would you think it was a logout icon let
121:25 - me know like I said we can put a tooltip
121:28 - over it as well so if users are unsure
121:31 - what it means we can have it there I
121:33 - definitely I don't want people to
121:35 - accidentally log out and now now that I
121:38 - think about it that was that was another
121:40 - reason why I did do it like this so I
121:43 - didn't want users to accidentally log
121:45 - out so I made it did you had to click
121:47 - twice to log out because one of the big
121:54 - selling points of when I presented this
121:56 - I did some some workshops to teach
121:58 - people how to use this when it first
122:00 - launched one of the big things was hey
122:02 - you don't have to worry about a password
122:04 - you don't even have to log in very often
122:06 - you log in once and you're logged in for
122:07 - a whole year and people like that so I
122:10 - didn't want it to be easy to log out
122:12 - because there really would be no reason
122:15 - for someone to want to log out unless
122:16 - they were on a public computer and you
122:19 - know didn't want to stay logged in so
122:21 - anyway that's another thing to consider
122:23 - that I just didn't remember from when we
122:26 - were talking about it before let's see
122:31 - Sebastian's or Blake says or lock open
122:34 - let's see what that is open
122:43 - yeah I'm not so sure to me this wouldn't
122:46 - I don't know that I think of logout when
122:48 - I see this but maybe maybe I'm wrong
122:50 - about that let me know what you all
122:51 - think Peter says I hate this loading
123:03 - thing on my screen do something about it
123:04 - that must have been before I got rid of
123:09 - it as well yeah I couldn't take the
123:12 - loading thing either okay okay good
123:22 - Sebastian said this dream doesn't start
123:23 - for 50 minutes and it looks like you
123:26 - said it less than 10 minutes ago all
123:29 - right so we'll be good we'll be done by
123:31 - then
123:39 - oh that's a good idea okay cool so okay
123:43 - Sebastian said what about a simple
123:45 - logout button or power settings for
123:48 - material okay so it looks like we have
123:50 - some option we'll check out some more
123:51 - buttons not right now cuz I'm gonna have
123:54 - to leave in a few minutes but all right
123:58 - well we'll look at some some more of
124:02 - these icons and see which one will be
124:04 - appropriate because blake has a great
124:06 - idea here is to say possibly after
124:09 - clicking it have a prompt reading are
124:11 - you sure you want to log out I like that
124:15 - I think that that makes more sense than
124:18 - what I was doing with making users click
124:22 - twice yeah that makes a lot more sense
124:24 - so we'll just have a little dialog come
124:29 - up that says that so anyway so yeah I
124:33 - really like that idea and yeah so we'll
124:39 - do that this is actually starting to
124:42 - look look not bad here got some row I
124:46 - con I mean they don't work yet it
124:48 - doesn't do anything can you click on
124:49 - them but it looks ok all right cool
124:52 - I got through everything in the live
124:53 - chat so if I happen to miss your
124:55 - question I'm really sorry I try to get
124:57 - through everything but if I did miss
124:59 - your question just put it in the
125:01 - comments to this video or send me a
125:04 - message on some social media thing and
125:07 - I'll shred you back to you soon as I can
125:11 - see I think that's it yeah I'll be back
125:15 - tomorrow sometime around 2 p.m.
125:18 - and until then have a great day
125:25 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and with on this stream you all get to have a glimpse inside my day as a frontend developer at a small University so I do my best to narrate as I work and I take some time to do a question and answer session so usually we do Pomodoro sessions so 25minute sessions of code take a five minute break for Question and Answer go back and forth like that until the end of the stream and then I answer all the questions that are left over sometimes that takes a while sometimes it doesn't but today we're going to continue what we have started yesterday which is doing some styling to our react projects using the latest version of material UI so material UI is a framework for a framework of react components that fit with the material design style so if you're familiar with pretty much any of the apps that Google has come out with with the exception of maybe a few of the older ones then you've seen a material design style let's see I want to start out first with a pull request so I received a pull request just a few minutes ago or maybe 10 10 minutes ago or so from Sebastian so I thought it might be cool to start with that pull request so I'll just go through how I normally review pool requests usually in the morning I come in and review any pull requests so I don't know that I've actually gone over that process on the stream so I haven't even looked at this pull request yet I don't know I don't know what's in it or how big it is or anything so this will be exactly my normal routine when when I see that there's a pull request so let's go oops let me type let me give you the n drop URL so if you want to see the site as we're working on it and be able to see it in your browser and use your own dev tools check out that link that I just put in a live chat I'm a paste it in there a little bit later on for for anyone who's joining us later so remind me if if remind me a little bit later on to paste it again if I forget and failed to complete total fennekin okay so it didn't work what's going on here oh okay you know what I changed the let me paste a different in I didn't realize I changed the local host so I need to do it again so I restarted my installed the latest Mac OS update and restarted and when I did oh my all my local servers that I had running shut down so when I went to run this again it ran it by default on localhost 3000 instead of 2001 so that's where the problem came in so I'm restarting it now with the correct port and this link should not work okay good it looks like it's getting a lot of status 200 okay is here and the console my other screen so so that's working let's go to I don't know why it's not pulling in any data so we'll take care of that soon but for right now I want to go over pull requests so first I'll go to github let me make this a bit bigger and increase the font size so you all can see what's going on so usually I come in here and I don't know why I'm not sure why I didn't get a notification about that usually I have a notification up here so that's that's weird does I didn't get the email I guess I could doublecheck yeah I did get the email about it so for whatever reason I didn't get a notification this time but normally it will notify you if someone submits a pull request to your repository but we'll just go in oh is this bullets in I might have to check out area it's down here so good in this bulletin react and I just got a slack message from one of my coworkers I stopped at the grocery store on my lunch break and picked up a bunch of cinnamon rolls and she said she just heated one up in the microwave and it's amazing now I'm gonna be thinking about that during the whole stream all right so let's go to pull requests and here's pull request number three from Sebastian and let's check it out I love that REE factorization alright so usually I just kind of go through what was said it looks like this would be a small pull request only one file change so when I go through whatever the person who submitted the request says then I check out the files just in general it's easier to merge in a smaller pull request I appreciate pool requests of all sizes but occasionally if I get a really big pull request if I like 75% of it you know it's awesome but there's 25% that I'm not sure about sometimes like I don't really want to pull the entire thing in so if it was broken up into smaller requests I could just pull in what I need so keep that in mind I when you're submitting to really any repositories is I think you have a better shot at getting your pull request merged if it's smaller and more focused because it's less likely to cause merge conflicts and you know take the the repository maintainer a really long time to go through ok so this is in the post preview and let's see what's changed it's it's just a refactor so it should still have the same functionality looks like it looks like it's just cleaned everything up and made it and they did a bit smaller here so that looks good actually this is straightforward enough that I could just merge it right here but since we're kind of demonstrating this I'd like to show you how I would go about testing it so let's go go back to the terminal and make this a bit bigger so on a very small pull request like this where I could very clearly see all the lines of code I would probably just merge it right there in github because I mean it's just so obvious what that code does but if it's bigger and I really want to test it out first then I'll go into my my project so let's see if I need and Xcode whenever you install an Xcode update it always messes things up you have not agreed you must agree to both hit the enter key alright agree all right awesome okay so if anybody ever read that whole thing I have never read it that's not even in English I guess it's not really that long right it's anyway all right so I'm just checking the status to make sure we don't have anything that's uncommitted that on this branch so we don't and then now I'm gonna go get fetch origin and the origin pool and then I'm gonna put the number of the pool request which in this case is three and then now I'm going to name this last part after the colon is what I'll name the branch so I'm just gonna say s refactor I'm just saying s refactor because it's Sebastian and so far there's only one person whose name starts with s this submitted pool request if I had more people I would probably come up with something better now I got to do this again since I restarted all right so let's on my other screen I'm gonna get my my key let's see so I don't know this offhand I have it saved in LastPass okay let's put that in there and then I'm gonna do SSH ad and that way it won't keep asking me for it so if you ever if you have this happen and you have to keep putting in your your passphrase just do run SSH ad and then put your passphrase in and it'll stay in there for me it stays in there until I restart I'm not there's probably some way to make it stay in there all the time but maybe it's better if you don't have to stay in there all the time just in case somebody gets into your computer okay so now let's go with I guess it already works so now we'll go get checkout yes refactor okay so now we have that pull request number three locally on our machine and we can test it out now at this point you'd want to remember if any packages have been added then you'd want to update so you just run yarn or you know or if you're using NPM you could do that but we don't have any new packages added so now we're just going to check it out see see what it looks like since this didn't add any new features it should be fine basically what I'm looking for let's see why this is not loading that work my sweet it's gonna be code make sure I save that's interesting I should be working let's go to need that oh this is where it's at you know just make sure the sights okay so the site is is up let's go let's go to the admin panel and see what's going on all right so we have graph QL I did go back to the older version oops and I just remembered I forgot to set my timer so I'm just gonna keep an eye on this probably once once we get close to 3 o'clock I'll take a fiveminute break and we'll do some questionandanswer stuff so if you're asking questions right now I'm not I'm gonna get to it probably in about 10 to 15 minutes I'll check the live chat and get to the questions ok oh ok so Blake says it's it is working on end grukk ok let me try that out then wow it is ok so I'm not sure what the problem is locally okay so for now I'm just gonna look here just to test it out and then we'll worry about whatever is going on locally in a minute so I'm just going to go in and click we only have a few views available basically I'm just when I test out at this point it's really simple we don't have any testing setup so when I want to test it out I go through and just check you know the views and see if we're getting errors and so we are we are getting some errors but I doubt that this is related to the the pool request we can double check by going back to master and see if it's still there okay let's see see if we get this error everywhere this is actually we went that wasn't the right one that was still the local okay so something's wrong with my local host and then this okay great so this works without any errors here and grout so so that's cool now at this point we could merge from the command line and if I would do that normally I would merge in the master branch into this pull request branch first test it out again and then merge everything in the master but I think let's let's check and see and github if we can merge this without any without any conflicts okay so no conflicts so what I'm gonna do is just merge right here because it's it's easier to just press that big green button so like I said I would only do this on a very small pool requests where you can see what's changed and it's very it's obvious otherwise would definitely test and merge from the command line and let's confirm that all right also so I know Sebastian is watching right now but I still like to say thank you to everyone that submits a pull request so thanks Sebastian and also yeah I'm okay with this so Sebastian is asking if I'm okay with it and is to start refactoring the other components yeah I think this is that's awesome let's go it was let me check again post preview that was it yes in the post preview it looks great oops I didn't actually pull it down haha it's gonna look even better so let's go get check out the master get pull to bring in those changes alright so now we have that locally now let's check out those preview ok here's a perspi oh actually no it was the same thing because we weren't on the master branch nevermind I don't know what I was thinking okay so anyway so Sebastian that looks great if you want to refactor some of the other components then that would be awesome too yeah so yeah let's do take another like five or six minutes to do some some more styling and then we'll do a question and answer okay let me let's go back here actually first what we should do is get this working I could just run off the end Rock one I guess so I'm gonna give it maybe like two minutes to try to figure this out if we can't I'll just do everything off the end rock but I would like to see why because yesterday this was working fine so what are we getting here okay see if we're getting okay syntax error mmm check okay I think I'm probably not gonna mess with this during the stream I'm just going to do one last thing and that is restart the server because sometimes that just works so it's worth a shot I don't really think it'll work in this case but it only takes a few seconds all right hey and it works ha ha I can't believe it all right let's just read this way twice all right get out of here let me pull the one that works over so for some reason it just didn't work in that tab I don't know what's going on come on going in it it won't come up there all right are you serious so I can get I can get local hose to work in other tabs but I can't get it to work here that's insane that's so crazy I mean watch this what what would cause that that it will work here and not here all right well this is not a debug Chrome stream so I'm not gonna mess with it there we go so I did a hard refresh and it worked so I'm I don't know what whatever it works let's just keep going oh there we go Blake and put in the live chat cache and I didn't see it yet so yeah honestly this those two things probably solve more problems restarting the server and clearing the cache oh wow I'm just glad it works okay so now now let's take a fiveminute break and do questions since I just took up the last five minutes just getting that to work so I'm gonna bring over my timer and we're gonna do a five minute break I'm gonna go through the latch and then we'll do another twenty five minutes of well we're legit gonna do some some styling I have now haven't really done much so far but I think it was worthwhile to go through the pull request process so I mean if you've never hosted your own repository where people were so many pull requests then you may you may not have gone through that before okay okay cool so Sebastian says in regard to the pull request as I read something about the previous pull request he had issues with the new JavaScript syntax or something I wanted to test with just a file if everything's okay I'll do more okay awesome you know did something weird with an on click hand earlier I just use the link the read more button okay so Sebastian is interested to see about what happens with the read more button yeah definitely works so yeah I mean if we're using react router then I think link is the way to go with that so it's good of that post detail was that the one now was it post preview that was it yeah so link I would think we would want to use link you know for every navigation so I don't have the the previous version to compare it to right now but that's that's what I would have done also in regard to that via the new JavaScript stuff so we do have because of the way we're using standard Jas sometimes when we have trying to find an example of functions okay so alright so like this we have render post so you get an error saying render post wasn't defined so harsh it when he submitted his full request number two did this right he defined them here in the constructor function but what I've been doing is instead not defining it in the constructor function so I'll just give an example now so we're gonna take this out and instead we're going to use an arrow function here that will handle the binding of this and then to handle the standard Jas complaining about it or whatever I mean es lense being used under the hood for that so I don't know exactly what it is that's giving the error message about it we're gonna go into our package JSON and then down here under our Global's I'm just I've been putting everything in Global's you can also do a similar thing right at the top of the file but it's just easy to put everything right here then you can see right at a glance all the stuff so you have to add a little bit either way you either have to put something in the component or you have to put something in here I kind of prefer to just put one line here if it got really huge we could probably take this out put it in another file if we wanted to but our package JSON is not very big at all so this works and then we save ourselves what was it like four lines in here inside the component so in here I would put render post and we'll say make sure you say both of those and let's go I'm just gonna run the Lintz so we can see we shouldn't get an error yep see it ran through everything we didn't get the error but now I'm not it's not loading again that's gonna be annoying okay I should have the cash off actually let's double check that in the settings see where there should be an option to disable caching when dev tools is open yep disable cache so that's on so I'm not sure what's going on with that we may just have to do a couple of hard refreshes okay hopefully that cleared up the whole issue with the air is coming from senator Chaz let's see kazeem sorry if I'm mispronouncing name it's qaz I am so I'm going to say Kazim says hi from Kosovo hey how's it going thanks for watching and joining in the live chat and my five minutes is up so I didn't get through everything this in a live chat right now but I will come back to where I left off and after the next Pomodoro session we'll do some more questions okay so let's go you know what let's add in let's make this actually you know drop down with some options and we'll add in a few other of the icons that we need here and I kind of I like to work my way like from the top down so we'll get this app bar you know kind of how we want it and also actually I think we'll go with the newer style that we've been doing on the last project the last couple of projects where you have the white with the gold underneath so my boss really likes that looks clean so let's do that so we'll change up some of the styles here add some icons add a drop down and then we'll throw in probably a logo here in the sidebar and yeah and then we'll see how long that takes you know we might not even get all that done but if it if we can get all that done then maybe we'll work on more on this sidebar ok so let's go into our our theme right so yesterday we set up a material UI theme and I believe that was in our layout yes so in our layout we actually have so we've brought in part of the theme here so see how we want to do this I don't know that I I obviously don't want to make our primary color white so what I'll do then is override our primary color just for that that app bar so let's for app bar let's go with backgroundcolor and we'll use oops what is white FFF yeah it's amazing how light you use the thing so many times and you know occasionally you're just you're just not sure about it okay all right so that will give us our white so if you're falling along with an grok you'll see that the whites right there I have a second window of this open on my other screen so I won't have to flip back and forth quite as much so we have that and now we want to do a bottom border so border so you want to do Solid 3 pixels I think we were doing three pixels for that bottom border we can double check at some point but I think three will work and we want our color to be let me I can't remember it offhand we'll have to grab it from an existing project so I'm opening up our resource center project on the other screen just so that I can grab this this color and it was it was three pixels so that's good be consistent there okay so we should see oops I forgot my a comma okay cool so let's see so right now you can see we have white with our gold underneath okay so we're going to want to change our color of our icons and let's see let's see if we can just put a color property on the app bar it might work might not be specific enough but if it works and that'll be great color and so let's do the CL that works whoops did I forget a comma again oh man I've been forgetting commas frequently lately alright great so that that wall that at least works for this so we still need that icon to have the color but that's good that it worked here and while we're at it I think I want to change I definitely want this to be a smaller font weight and perhaps just a little bit bigger so let's change that let's go ahead we can leave all those really small changes for another time let's get this what did we say that those feet with that icon was called was it more vert I think that's what it was let's get that more vert icon with the right color there so I don't think we have anything for an icon in here let's see where we're actually putting that icon in I don't remember plotting anything okay that's interesting color contrast I wonder actually I kind of want to look up what what it does there with color contrast so let's check the material design documentation or outside material UI so we are using the version 1 and let's go to icons let me make this a bit bigger for everyone okay icons it's just not there then we get icon somewhere there we go icons what was that icon button now let's see what they have here let's try let's check out the button component then since we're actually using an icon button component it may be here under buttons icon button here we are okay so this icon button this button color okay so color contrast alright let's see our API is so color color is using the theme palette when that makes sense oh okay so it's so somewhere in the theme we define what the contrast color is and then it's going to use that okay so if we reset this to primary it should pull that green color which is what we want so let's do that then so I mean we definitely could have just overrode this dial and it would have been a lot faster but I mean just I think it's nice to work within you know the way that the people who design material you I you know set that out to work it'll be a lot more consistent that way later on if we decided to change our primary color this would automatically change the correspond to it which is kind of nice probably not going to change it but it's nice to have it all linked up like that so you can see now we have our icon and let's see so now let's I'd really like to add the drop down I don't think I've used the drop down yet for material you I and any of our projects so this will be cool it'll be the first time to implement this on the stream so let's go to back to our documentation and let me see I forgot to reset my timer so I'm just gonna have to look again so we started this Pomodoro session around 300 so around 325 I just have to keep an eye on it okay so where's I just have to figure out what it's called here and may not be called a dropdown maybe menu concealer whoops actually want the demo first so we can see it and you yeah that's what I want okay so it's I'm just calling it a dropdown but it's it's really a menu so there we go this is we won't need all these options but that's kind of what I'm going for when you click on this then we give it so let's just go with the simple example and so we're going to need to grab import this and let's see menu item to me okay we are importing that as well great so let's do that in our in our layout because this is where we have that app bar so at the top let's pull in that menu oops oh man let me move this over I'm accidentally clicking my minimap over here that's what sent me down there okay so let's do that and now right below we put it right here below the icon button oops or this icon button that way we'll keep them together I'm gonna be easier to tell you know what which is which here I probably could break it out into another component you know this whole thing but for now we'll leave it in there can always refactor later on let's see here it is here's a menu so I'm gonna copy this all in and we'll have to change it a bit looks like we're gonna have to copy in this as well okay so here's a menu okay let's pull this in yes saving needs need this button need our button to have these as well it's the icon button it's gonna have a lot here so let's bring these down just to help us read it alright let's see if that's if that will work oops haha and these aren't defined so let's go ahead and put these in our package.json so what did we have is not the fun and handle click and the request closed now states should definitely be States at work we have it in our package JSON right yeah we have it in there mmm that's weird and just handle click whoops there we go and it was the other one handle requests close all right let's save that see if we get and that's uh what'd I miss oh oh actually you know what yeah that doesn't make sense because we weren't linting there that was just a normal air and it's an Oakland maybe I did I paste this in the wrong spot let me see yep all right thanks Sebastian it's I based into the wrong place what was I thinking yeah be kidding me Wow all right so we already have state so let's bring in shoot we're gonna have to change that so we don't want that to be open let's go open open menu and we'll change it down here to open menu and select all this there we go open menu all right there we go now let's bring this in let's see if we have okay doesn't look like we're repeating anything and then we also need to do within here I'm going to make sure we say open menu okay all right I think that should work now we would have had to have had that added this the package.json at some point anyway so hey look at that it works awesome okay cool so that wasn't too bad to to implement if I could just photo just pasted it into the right spot it would have been even easier all right awesome so that works we're not going to want all of these we're gonna keep logout and then actually let me I don't remember what other options should be there let me check the time so I don't pass up the next okay so maybe in about seven minutes or so we'll do our next question and answer session so if you got any questions in the live chat and I haven't responded I'm not ignoring you I would definitely get to it in the question answer session or at the end of the stream let's see I'm just doublechecking here my other screen what I want in that menu what actually let me bring this over because I don't think I've shown how the login works so this is currently how the login works for the live version of the bulletin so if your if the login data is not saved in local storage it shows this screen so I can type and so I type in my email JY by Franciscan edu if I were to put in an email address that wasn't at Franciscan ddu it wouldn't let it go through so even if you did something with dev tools and let it go through it still wouldn't it wouldn't work so it checks on the client side and the server side so when I submit this I get a link sent to me so whoops that's not it chuna pull the link over on the screen there it is okay so I get this link and second display images alright so this link comes in if I click it then I'm signed in to the bulletin and then Oh Acts I guess I'd only had logout as the option right now all right well so I guess we can take out the other options for now and that lengthy you get is a it's a singleuse link so once it's used once then you won't be able to log in again if you try to use it again you'll get an error message so that's the current login system which hopefully we're going to be changing that soon although it does work well as long as some users do clear out their local storage often so it doesn't work well for them but for people who don't do that it makes it really easy because you can basically you stay logged in for a year as long as you're not clearing anything out okay let me but I am to do this just so we can see my stuff again alright so let me take out right now our other menu items depending on how much time we have and what we want to do with this I would like to add in some menu items like profile or my account to allow users to customize their experience a little bit but since we're not we don't have anything like that right now just going to keep things clean in here and take them out it seems silly to have a menu like that for one item but it was it was kind of always intended to have more just haven't haven't really had time to come back to this project since it wants last year okay so let's add in let me check the current version of this so we want to add a printer icon and then kind of a grid icon and a search search icon so let's go I wonder we'll probably have to go to our icons to get the name so there we go alright so if you if you want material design style icons this is definitely the place to go material do slash icons you get all these icons here and you can get them in several different formats right now we have already imported these icons so we can use them in our project but if I hadn't imported them I you like to grab the the SVG code for them and just put it in line so let's look for the print icon first alright so here we have print and we can see you know we could grab the SVG the ping or we could pull it in as an icon font we can pull it in we can use different colors here we're going to change the color of that green that we've been using so that doesn't really matter you know if we were to grab the SVG doesn't matter by I just mean you know we can download the SVG and then open it up copy and paste the code right there in line into our project but for now I just wanted to make sure of the name so we should be able to just use print icon so let's grab our icon button and I'm gonna paste it and paste it in here I'm hoping that this goes to the left of our current that's more vert icon button we'll see not sure let's see for now let's get rid of these this will probably end up having will may end up putting a link component either inside the button or wrapping the button in the link component but for now we just want it to get we want it to show up so assuming we can just do prints since we already have color primary it should be the right color I'm gonna save that and let's check it out for an icon is not defined well I don't think we imported it up here revert icon actually can we there's got to be a better way to do this than importing them all these icons separately right oh well when maybe we'll figure that out at some point but you would think that you could just do something like this right and import from icons all right so let's try it now we're actually importing that first for an icon great alright awesome and that worked just like we wanted it to you know the print icon there as well so it's time to do another fiveminute question answer and we can have all our icons there probably doesn't need quite so much space in between but that's something you know that's a little thing that we can adjust later on sometimes if you try to adjust at least for me in my experience if I try to adjust those little things early on they want to get more things on the page I end up wanting to adjust them again and it's better if I just hold off until I get like a clearer picture of the hole more things on the page then I then I end up adjusting once instead of multiple times throughout okay so let me go to my live chat and I'm gonna scroll up to the point where I left off and get through as much as I can in five minutes at the time yeah I think we'll go with three Pomodoro sessions so I know yesterday we didn't do quite as much coding as we normally do so we'll make up for it today by putting in an extra session and so we'll have a fiveminute question answer now another 25 minutes of code and then afterwards we'll have a long question answer session where I can get to everything that's left over after these five minutes so let me bring out my timer I don't know where I put it and I got minimize that I did all right here we go okay okay so James asks how do I have to be are ok how skilled do I have to be to join these live streams actually it doesn't it really depends on kind of what you want so we we go over some some things that are like a whole different range of skills so sometimes we go over things that are more advanced sometimes we do things that that aren't really that advanced so depending on what we're working on for a particular stream it may be more useful to you if you know if you're at a lower skill level so it generally it's I like to have a mix of different skill levels watching and in the live chat and then that way the people who you know really skilled can help out can help me out and can help the other people in the live chat out with any issues that they're having and help to explain and I try to do my best to explain as them as I'm going along so if I'm not explaining well feel free to ask any questions so I may not look at the live chat during the code session so I at at one point where you're streaming I tried to go through the live chat all the time and it ended up that we just we didn't get a lot of code done at all so that's why I've kind of separated them out but I will get to your questions eventually but I mean if you it kind of depends on if you want if you want like a straight tutorial that really gets to the point this is probably not the best place for that because you know we're always working on something different and it's it's not really methodical and how we teach things so it's more just to show like here's what my normal day is as a frontend developer but I do try try to do my best to explain things so you could get something out of it see Sebastian says with react 16 you can use class instead of class name right okay and Melissa says yes that's cool I hadn't I didn't realize you could do that I actually just read through some react 16 stuff before the stream today it looks like there's a lot that changed behind the scenes that make it faster and neck and smaller so that's pretty awesome okay James says can you do a beginning code that lined up the first project and free code camp yeah so yeah that one was the one so I started to do that one on my own channel so if you come in just in the free code camp channel it's I've already done a few streams at that point so you don't see you like the startup so check out I think I have linked in the description of this video the link to my channel my personal channel so if you check that out and you go to the project that is the title of the first video is building a website as fast as I can let's it ended up not being that fast but initially because of the deadline it was going to be really fast but gets on some leeway there so check that video up first if it's still not I don't remember exactly where I started out there but if it still needs like even more introduction I'm definitely open to going back maybe and you know kind of doing more of an introductory video on that but yeah check that one out I do maybe two or three streams on my own channel and then I switch over to freako cam okay John Hanson says had a hard time getting modal's to work as I would like and react even with react router looking forward to reworking modal's and react 16 awesome yeah so John have you been have you been using a framework like material UI or trying to do modal's from scratch because I think something like a framework it does make it pretty easy all right me let me mark down where I'm even off at and we'll do one more session of coding all right and I just saw right when I was working down the time so in us as hey what are you building a a Niles are going we are working on a react project with with graph Pio we're using Apollo to bring in stuff from graph qo and we're styling it today with the latest version of material UI ok alright so all right let's throw in those next there's two icons quickly since we know we know how to do it and it'll work so we just need to get the names of those icons so we want a grid not like that layouts see if it's in layout actually the me I'm gonna inspect the the current site that we're redoing and see if I use the material I con mathira khan grid button we call it a quilt is it huh wow it is called view quilt Wow I would not have guessed that okay so let's do the quilt and I'm just gonna I'm not gonna put it in twice now go get in there so let's do view quilts and down here let's figure out this and I'm gonna copy it twice in here since we know we're going to do another one and for this one we want the few quotes and I'll save that and then finally we want the search I'm almost positive search is just gonna be search so let's just try that out before we look it up search I'll go up to the top all right let's check it out awesome so we have our icons here great cool all right so let's move on and try to put the logo up in this corner I think so by default this is gonna be open so on it on a large screen let's see it look pointed okay so we actually don't have it we're gonna have to change this so that it's not always open because on a mobile that just doesn't give us enough room but so we may be able to display the logo on mobile I'm okay actually with not like you know let's say this is closed we go to a small screen and we just have something like this of course we'd want this text to be over here but I'm okay with not having the logo appear immediately and instead it appears when you click this oops and it looks like we need to change the color of this as well I've forgotten about that icon there should be a hamburger menu icon here but it's it's white so let's change that right now before you forget so anyway I think a logo right here will work let's change that color though so if we go down our icon button instead of contrast we want to give it the color primary which we if you remember from before we set that primary color as our green so now yep there we go so now we have that icon awesome all right so let's check out this sidebar component and see if there's some way to put a logo up here already builtin if not you know we'll have to make it work so where's my documentation I don't think we need these icons anymore so see the drawer see what we called that component yeah okay it is a drawer using a persistent drawer awesome okay so I don't see yeah I don't see any example with something up here let's check out the drawer API and see if there's anything anything that we could use okay so let's see anything so let's look in here and see if we can figure something out so classes from your header okay so here's our drawer header that's where we would want to put it so far we do have an icon button here we do want to keep that so let's try to put in an image into here and need to bring in I don't think we have a folder yet for images so for now I'm going to grab the image address from another site that Resource Center site so eventually we'll want to actually bring in the image but for now this will let us test it out quickly so there may see is there an image I don't know if there's an image component built into media built into material UI alright I don't see one so we'll just go with a regular image alright so this at least will give us something to work with for now to see what it looks like right now hmm there we go okay so we have the image in there right now it's way too big again it's covering up our our icon to close this so definitely need some work we can do a little bit of that right here in dev tools just make this a bit smaller and let's work on dev tools see where sidebar is there we go okay so let's give this see if we could do with percent so that's a little bit better we want to give it let's give it a margin 16 pixels it's let's increase it a bit I want to see I want to see where that button went to all right interesting so maybe if we switch the order it may work out a little better for us with that button we could try let's let's try I'd rather not mess with this button as much because you know everything's set from within the mature UI theme for that so instead let's let's try to position this in a way that will allow this button to do this thing normally what I'm thinking is if we go and do something like this well now it's messing up everything I didn't think about these ones down here all right so that might not be an option and keep that in mind though but then we'd have to position things these down further so for now it's not really an option let's see if we do if you can use flex one simply does for us nothing yeah let me switch the order then oops and I did not add my styles on this so good thing we didn't have too much going on all right so to shrink it down okay so this is giving us something a little bit more like what I wanted at least this button is visible and it's in the right spot I'm guessing what we'll probably want is for this to be up a little bit further so we don't have to move the logo down quite so far yeah under if we it's gonna check the live chat quickly as well to see if anyone has any solution actually image tag before the button saying okay cool just receive anyone had any thoughts on this okay nice image let's see I do I want to check before I start messing with this button too much I want to check the API for the button and see what we can do through the API otherwise we'll just have to override some stuff which is okay so okay so we can not but you know I don't want to override all the buttons so I'm not going to do it like this we'll just do it in line on that particular button so let's try some things out here in dev tools you check my time okay yeah we try some things out in dev tools see what we can do actually positionabsolute might not be this might not be bad for this we can just put a margin on the image what do we do before 16 yeah we definitely need it to be a bit more than that okay we'll see Outlook I'm actually not now that I see this I don't like all the space on the top but give it a shot for now and let's see why do we have all this space anyway that's good interesting I really don't like that what do you all think I'm not I'm not a fan of this does not look good to me okay you know what yeah if you're if you're checking this out through and Rock you won't see any of this right now because I'm just doing this in dev tools yes so that's not I guess the the alternative is to not potentially if you don't have to give users the option to close this currently there is no option to close this on the the version that's live right now I'm usually all for giving users as many options as possible but in this case it's something that the users can't do now and I haven't had any any requests for it so an on mobile it would open and then you would simply have to click outside of it to get it to close so you know you hit the icon for it to open so how about I'd say for now let's just take this out or we could have even commented out just so that we don't forget that it's there maybe we'll comment it out and then we'll come back to it later on if we have time because I think that's that falls into the category of something that would be a nice feature but it's certainly not a necessary feature and especially since I've I've never had a request from a user to be able to do this I think probably it's it's not necessarily worth the time to get this to work right now yeah so let's do that so I'm gonna do we do comments and reacts like this yep there we go there's not some better way to do comments and react right am i I don't to be that missing let's do this we don't take up quite as much space there we go alright so as far as I know that's the only way to do comments and reacts all right so let's say that we'll probably want to comma comment out the Chevron left up top here otherwise it'll probably tell us somewhere that we've imported this and we're not using it no I got it Judy are you really I don't know what's going on with this okay so now on our image let's go let's just add to this to these styles and let's do a logo styles and we can put with 100% whoops forget this is an object not normal CSS with a hundred percent and let's add some a set of margin I will do padding all the way around we'll give it eight pixels see how that looks but I think eight pixels will look alright we might want a little bit more maybe on the top we'll see oops and I forgot my comma and I forgot to tie it and who our component down here so let's find our image yeah it's gonna pass it up right there we go let's go to a style and what do you call that logo sis styles we did pull that in two styles right you'll find another spot where you use that just as Tyl he equals the only using it in one place all right well we can see if it'll work here nope it didn't and we're using this somewhere right classes flex okay this it's not really it's easy classes that wait a second what am I doing wrong class name clot that's it thank you Sebastian class name classes okay on my other my react native project I'm doing everything with the style tag so I'm saying style when I'm bringing in styles dot whatever that's what I kept trying to do and I don't have it set up like that for this okay not bad maybe oh yeah maybe didn't give it you so do we have if this side bar has a fixed width which it does all right let's try this 250 twofifty oops let's try 2 34 pixels okay that works the accomplice is basically the same thing so here's so basically what I did instead of doing with 100% which was not letting us get our our margins the way we wanted since this has a fixed width the sidebars are fixed with the 250 pixels what we wanted was 8 pixels on each side so we just made the logo 234 pixels which gave us that extra 16 for each side and then we had 8 pixels on the top and the bottom and then for right and left we set it to auto which splits it equally so that's how we got our positioning here so now we'll go back over and change this in the component so go back up to where we set our logo styles so you want to 34 pixels and 8 pixels of Auto and okay actually that's we're not getting our eight pixels on the top and the bottom will just happen oh oh I didn't I had switched it to margin let's see if that makes a difference yep it does okay great all right not bad and my timer went off so it's just in time we got that that done so we have our whole top portion pretty much done I'd like to make a few little little changes here and there really minor things so next up will be getting the rest of this sidebar looking like it's supposed to and then when we want to building out some of the views okay so let me actually I want to commit this now because I I've been forgetting to commit and later on so I don't want anybody even wants to maybe work on this to have you know the older version of the code so let's check our status see what's changed okay this looks good these are the things that we we did actually changed so let's go get commit we're gonna add the am flag which means adds we're gonna add all those files then we're also going to put in a commit message at the same time in line with our command so let's say icons okay that works and then we're gonna get push origin master to push that up to github it's going to do all its most Auto formatting checks and everything wait did it do all for money that was weird for some reason it wasn't automatically running that so I'm not sure what's going on with that so I guess I'll do another commit okay yeah it didn't do the normal lifting all right so that's all up in the github repo so everything that we've done is available now the link to the repo is in the description so now I'm gonna scroll back up to where I left off in the live chat so if you can't stick around for the live chat thank you so much for watching I'll be back tomorrow sometime around 200 p.m. Eastern Time but if you can stick around definitely I hope you can and help out with answering questions or asking some of your questions I am gonna try to get through all the questions I do I have an appointment at 500 so it probably can I'm probably safe to go at least a half hour with questions and so we'll see hopefully I can get through everything normally not only able to okay see James says he just seems to want to impress someone and not here to help out what are these projects based upon anyway I'm not sure is James James might be talking about me I don't see him talking about anybody else so anyway yeah James I don't know so I'm not sure how much you've seen but it's actually a probably the opposite I don't know that I impress that many people with this I frequently mess up and make mistakes that's kind of the whole point is for people to see someone who is employed fulltime as a frontend developer making a lot of mistakes and trying to work through it so yeah so if I was out to impress I would not live stream I would record and edit out all of my mistakes usually the most impressive thing that happens in the stream or the pool request that you all submit it makes the projects so much better than I ever could have made them and the projects the projects are actually based upon my work project so I'm currently at my job and I work on whatever my boss says I need to work on so that's why we have a few projects going on at once and sometimes we switch projects depending on what's what's needed so that's what it's based on the styling is based on the style guide for the University of that work at so I have I do have quite a bit of freedom in the tools that I use but there are some things that I can't change so one of it being you know we've set the styles so I kind of have to stick with that you know I have some leeway with that but we couldn't just completely change and go with like an entirely different philosophy on design let's see James says do you know skills enough to explain to people how to adjust their issues that we have with coding I never seen a coding channel in a fashion such as this can you help us out I can definitely try to help you out so if you have any put them in the live chat and you can also ask me questions on other social media things so if you send me something on Twitter so my Twitter is linked in the description as well or really anything i have i've got messages on linkedin facebook twitter instagram through email any of those i'll try to get back to you as soon as i can i can't always get back right away because i you know i have a lot going on i have four kids and my job and I'm taking a Udacity daño degree course so I can't respond immediately but I do always try to get back to everyone eventually with some help or at least some helpful links as in regards to whether I have enough skills to explain to people I don't really know that's why I say in the live chat you know anybody who if you can stick around for the live chat even if you're an expert and don't have questions I definitely appreciate your sticking around and helping to answer questions because you know in this field even if I were an expert at something I can't be an expert at everything so they're always going to be questions about things that I don't I've never used before so when that happens you know I'm I'm fine with saying hey I don't really know you know does anybody else have any input so in terms of my skills I you know I don't know you all can can tell me I have I have had some a lot of positive feedback though that people say that I have helped out certainly in regard to someone who's just starting out I'm pretty confident in my CSS my HTML skills in terms of react you know I'm still going through and learning things I'm much much better than I was even you know six months ago so you know this show we're kind of all learning together and helping each other out so you know I'll do my best to give advice when I can but then also let you all know whenever I'm probably not the best resource so you know take take what I say for what it is let's see okay okay Paul says in response to James says he's far ahead not at the beginning level you can google on material UI and he's showing us how to style using material you eye components yeah so this this particular stream was not necessarily beginner level so you probably would have had to have some knowledge of how react works and maybe a little bit about material UI so this particular shame not maybe not really good for beginners maybe some of the later on we were just doing some basic you know positioning stuff with CSS it would be project three has some stuff that it's not react based it's more like just plain HTML and CSS we are dealing some with some csharp templates but I'm gonna do some things with project three to make it a lot more beginner friendly especially for beginners to submit pull requests so I've had some other stuff that I had to work on when I'm not streaming so I haven't been able to get that ready yet but hopefully I'll be finished up with with some updates I need to make to that project one that we had done and when I'm done with that maybe it'll free up a little bit more time for me and I can get that going so as we go back into project three from time to time that's probably the best place for beginners right now okay James says sorry for beating you up but I'm wanting to get my point across oh don't worry about it yeah definitely I any questions or comments or anything I definitely welcome even if it's criticism because I want to make these streams you know as good as they can be for you also don't feel bad about you know any any comments let's see James says well well think of us let's see he didn't say that when he first started making videos about coding okay I'm not sure what I would he said at that time or what I said at that time so see okay Sebastian says you know he will answer your question when she finishes yeah yeah so yeah so if I mention from time to time but if if you come into the stream in the middle of a session just just to let you all know I'm not ignoring the live chat so I do get to the questions but I have to space it out otherwise I just can't get coding done if I'm constantly going back and forth from questions to code so I've tried doing it like that and the streams end up being really long and we don't really get that much done so we kind of split out the the question answer session from that but we still do get to the questions see I Paul says it's a series just a demo of his talent on advanced topics so thank you for that Paul but I I don't I kind of gone with what I said before I don't know that this is a demo of my talent yeah so that the point is like and I know I've said this before but for anybody who's new that's watching I there are so many great people that are doing tutorials like free recorded tutorial videos and they're awesome but the thing that I thought might be helpful that I can help with I didn't really think I could compete with the people that are already doing great tutorials but I thought at least I can help new developers out by showing them what it's like for me as a fulltime developer and just how many mistakes I make and how hard it is to work through because sorry I just realized I left my fan on so I apologize if the fan was kind of annoying to anybody I just turned it off so anyway I am I just thought it might be helpful for people to see like when you see the coding videos that are tutorials it seems like the people doing it are awesome they don't make any mistakes right which is fine for those videos because you want to get to the point you want to teach people so you don't want to leave in all mistakes but I thought it might be helpful for people to see that you know even someone who does have a fulltime job as a programmer still makes those mistakes sometimes really silly mistakes I mean if you've if you've watched previous streams you know sometimes I just make you know ridiculous mistakes and it takes me forever to figure it out so anyway that's that's what I thought I brought to it so it's not it's not really me demonstrating my skills or anything like that if I do something awesome on the live stream then that's great that's really cool but I also think it's really cool when I mess something up on the live stream and that can be more helpful than me doing it right because you know then you'll see the mistakes that I make and you know you're kind of ahead of the game you won't make those same mistakes because you've already seen me do it and we've worked through it together I need to come up with like a really brief way to say that and just say it at the beginning of all the shows and maybe put it in the description because I think I say that frequently and maybe I'll like write it out and condense it as much as I can let's see Carlos says that comma issues should be caught by the linter Yellen set on well I thought I had it set on commit to lint but for some reason it wasn't it wasn't working right so but anyway yeah what I need to set things up so that it automatically does it as I'm typing okay cool set James says I'm on myfirstproject and free code camp so awesome James that's great starting out so yes so if you have any questions about any of the free code camp stuff let us know here in the lab chat or like I said you know on some other form of social media I'd be happy to help out if I can let's see James says can you build a dating website I would like to learn about that is that hard hard work yeah so well like I mentioned before since I'm doing these streams from work I really like I need to work on my work project so I work for University so I'm not going to be working on a dating website but it potentially some of the things that we work on here could be used for other projects I know some people have taken some of our previous projects clone the repo and then change things to make it work for their use case so that's possible too you could definitely build a website like that with react I don't know in terms of like the back end in the database we don't get into databases very much at all on this stream although we might in the future so there's definitely more to it than it would be in this stream but you know in terms of all the front end you know you could definitely learn enough to build out a front end for something like that Sebastien says so we were talking about this sign let this drop down menu and saying you know right now it really only has one option and so Sebastian says it's kind of pointless why not just have a logout button and you're right Sebastian so basically there were two reasons why I made it like this initially one is I intended to have more options there and I just never had time to put them in also I wasn't sure what the proper button is for logout that's kind of universally known so one of the requirements was this had to work for people who are not really that familiar with computers so I don't know I mean to be honest with you now that I think about it would people really know that this was a menu so if anyone has any ideas for an icon that would mean logout we can go with that but I really would like to have some other options here if we could to give users you know some some customization so we'll see hopefully for now I'm going to leave it in just because I hope to put more options here but if we get closer to the time when this is going to launch and we still don't have options then maybe we'll swap in some icon and we'll just put a tooltip over it so that people will know what it what it does let's see all right James says does anybody have the heart to help me with advice as a developer X I mean I think but going to free code camp is already a great kind of first step so if you work through the free code camp stuff and try to supplement that with maybe YouTube videos knotti not necessarily these streams but there's a lot of other great streams on free code camp and other YouTube channels so like all of on this channel like Bo's JavaScript videos are great great like intro to different things in JavaScript so when you get to that part in free code camp check those videos out also for like CSS stuff dev tips is a really good YouTube channel that I've gone to for a lot of more like design and CSS things for some more JavaScript stuff and build tools and things like that learn code Academy is a great JavaScript or a great YouTube channel that I've used before and then so there's a lot of different types of videos on the free code camp channel too so if you check out some of the playlists there's just a huge variety of content so I'm kind of I'm the only one that does like the daytoday live streaming kind of thing but there's a lot of other really talented people that you do great tutorial videos and things so so definitely check those out if you're more the type of person that likes to learn by reading there's a book series it's you just called you don't know Jay s and that's actually for available for free on github so you can just read it online so check that out that's that's really good and my only other advice if you're new is like just keep working through it you're definitely gonna have some times I know I did where it just seems like I'm working on this problem and I just can't can't get through it but just don't give up keep on working and once you finally get through that problem you're gonna feel great and you're always gonna look back at you know where you were at a few months ago and just realize like I've come so far and that's pretty awesome feeling so for me at least it's definitely worth it you know to just keep going and keep trying to push through and and it's great if you have other people around so like this live chat is how we form kind of a little community here so you know if you need if you need some help or you just need somebody to say like you know hey keep going for it you can do it you know it's kind of cool to have a little community so it doesn't have to be this community for the live chat if you have some other people in your area you can meet with that's that would be amazing too but if anyone else has any advice please put it in the live chat and I'm sure some of you probably already have I haven't got to it yet let's see okay in US if I've ever used UJS and is it better than react I have never used UJS but I know some really good developers I don't mean no personally I mean like just through Twitter and stuff so I know some really good developers who loved UJS and have used both you and reacts so I don't really know I would view seems really promising and I think maybe one day I'd like to try it out I'm just really trying to get good with react at this point so I don't want to branch out right now I mean you know how it is you can know a little bit about a lot of things you can specialize and get really good at one thing so I'm kind of in specialization mode right now but if I get to the point where I feel kind of confident and want to branch out a bit I think I will definitely try view but until I try it I don't know that I really would have a great opinion on whether it's better than react I mean I'm happy with reacts so far I really like it but you know there's also a lot of people that like view so I'm sure it's good to see Samson says the hover menu completely hides the button yeah it does we could probably work on that if we do decide to keep the hover menu I mean it I guess it doesn't really matter that it hides the button because you you don't really need to click the button again but it might not be quite as weird if we push it down a bit and up we could probably do that this this loading thing is bothering me so I'm just refreshing let's see eric says react jess is the future I mean that it does definitely keeps growing so at least for the for the foreseeable future I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon John Hansen says I'm a from scratch type of person I used to I'll be all about like trying to do things from scratch but I definitely appreciate some boilerplate now when I got to get a project done quickly you know that really helps but it is definitely good to know how to do everything from scratch and really understand you know what's what goes into you know setting things up Eric asked it has Adam gotten really buggy for you was thinking about switching back to visual studio code but want to stick with Adam actually Adam has gotten a little bit buggy so on this computer it's fine but on my laptop it's been really buggy lately I don't understand why I have the same plugins on both for the most part using the same version so I don't know I haven't really dug into the problem yet to see what's going on maybe I just have some outdated plugin that I need to get rid of but yeah I'm not quite ready to switch completely to Visual Studio code but I have been using it some so we'll see I'm right now I'm still with Adam let's see all right I'm just going to try I think I'm gonna skip some of the comments to make sure I can get to all the questions so look at there's some discussion about Adam here see see Kim says normal HTML style comment works in and JSX okay cool okay cool innocence thank you it is a pretty useful stream awesome thanks for thanks for saying that I'm glad I'm glad it's useful to you okay Sebastian said this there's another live stream scheduled for free code camp a live workshop basics of JavaScript and es6 syntax I'm not witness is scheduled I'm not cutting into it right let's try to look for I didn't get a notification about it yet so hopefully it's not I'm not taking up their time Kiyoshi says what tips would you recommend a junior developer interested in getting a job and reacts so I would say build build things with react I mean that it sounds straightforward I know but that's like build things with react having a github if you're not already on github get a github profile and put code in there just get good ideas for different react projects so just think about something like an app or something that you think would be useful and make it get ideas from your friends and family and just do it so if you if you have the time like the free time to be able to do it that's great if you need to work and actually make money you know try to get some clients and make things and react even make things that don't necessarily need to be in react but just do it in react for the practice you like employers will want to see that you can actually do the work so they'll want to look at github they'll want to see demos of what you can do so that would be my biggest thing the other thing would be if you can't network so either online and so like on your social media accounts talk about being a developer talk about how much you like being a developer try to comment in a helpful way to to other developers especially on Twitter Twitter seems to be pretty big for you know for developers so because employers will look at that right if they see and they're really interested in you they'll check your social media stuff so you know if your social media is full of things entirely unrelated to development they might think you don't really care about it or if it's full of a lot of negative things about how much you hate you know this or that about JavaScript or something then they might think you're too negative of it so just keep that in mind that anything that you put online is public your employer would potentially see so just start kind of working on building up you know kind of your online presence as being someone who is positive and excited about being a developer and helping other developers so that's kind of that's my my advice to you I'm sure there's a lot of other things that you could do but for me I know when I've been involved in the hiring process for developers and I immediately want to look at their github repo and look at projects that they've worked on and check that out and then if I'm interested I will check out their social media and I'm more interested in that than their resume so I mean I do look at the resume but if someone has an amazing resume but they don't include a link to github and I can't find any of their code anywhere I'm not really interested maybe if no one else applies I would reach out to them but if there are other people with the less impressive resume but I actually see their stuff on github and it's good I'm much more likely to want to interview that person various says which Udacity nano degree are you taking I'm taking the react nano degree so I've there there are three projects for that nano degree I'm done with the first two I just need to do the last one which is react native app and then hopefully if I do the last one and it works and everything then they don't have my nano degree so I'm hoping to have all that done by the end of this month and when I get done with my my last project oh I'll show you all in the livestream if you want maybe during like one of the questionandanswer sessions give you a little little preview of it let's see she says in 2017 what should I learn to be a full sack developer I am fluent in frontend design HTML CSS bootstrap JavaScript what should I learn to become a full stack developer Vleck spirit says no js' yeah yeah for sure I recommend no js' it'll probably be easier for you to learn node since you already know javascript then to switch to a completely different language so it kind of depends it like really on what you want to work with but if you don't have any specific company or technology you want to work with and I'd go with node that'll probably the easiest transition as you should also ask about the database vole expert recommends DB is popular with node yeah I've heard great things about DB there are some really cool things people were doing with couch and pouch DB so check that out I've seen some some cool demos at conferences with that it couldn't hurt to learn a little bit about sequel based databases because you you're likely to end up at a company that uses sequel because it's it's definitely used more often than no sequel stuff so I try to be familiar with both with both types but if you want to specialize I said Mongoose does seem to be really popular with with node various says don't wait to be an expert to code start now yeah definitely yeah the only way you get better is just it's actually code just work your way through it okay so blake has a suggestion for the logout icon let's check it out serial icons and what was that called exit exit okay we'll see what do you all think does this icon if you saw this icon would you think it was a logout icon let me know like I said we can put a tooltip over it as well so if users are unsure what it means we can have it there I definitely I don't want people to accidentally log out and now now that I think about it that was that was another reason why I did do it like this so I didn't want users to accidentally log out so I made it did you had to click twice to log out because one of the big selling points of when I presented this I did some some workshops to teach people how to use this when it first launched one of the big things was hey you don't have to worry about a password you don't even have to log in very often you log in once and you're logged in for a whole year and people like that so I didn't want it to be easy to log out because there really would be no reason for someone to want to log out unless they were on a public computer and you know didn't want to stay logged in so anyway that's another thing to consider that I just didn't remember from when we were talking about it before let's see Sebastian's or Blake says or lock open let's see what that is open yeah I'm not so sure to me this wouldn't I don't know that I think of logout when I see this but maybe maybe I'm wrong about that let me know what you all think Peter says I hate this loading thing on my screen do something about it that must have been before I got rid of it as well yeah I couldn't take the loading thing either okay okay good Sebastian said this dream doesn't start for 50 minutes and it looks like you said it less than 10 minutes ago all right so we'll be good we'll be done by then oh that's a good idea okay cool so okay Sebastian said what about a simple logout button or power settings for material okay so it looks like we have some option we'll check out some more buttons not right now cuz I'm gonna have to leave in a few minutes but all right well we'll look at some some more of these icons and see which one will be appropriate because blake has a great idea here is to say possibly after clicking it have a prompt reading are you sure you want to log out I like that I think that that makes more sense than what I was doing with making users click twice yeah that makes a lot more sense so we'll just have a little dialog come up that says that so anyway so yeah I really like that idea and yeah so we'll do that this is actually starting to look look not bad here got some row I con I mean they don't work yet it doesn't do anything can you click on them but it looks ok all right cool I got through everything in the live chat so if I happen to miss your question I'm really sorry I try to get through everything but if I did miss your question just put it in the comments to this video or send me a message on some social media thing and I'll shred you back to you soon as I can see I think that's it yeah I'll be back tomorrow sometime around 2 p.m. and until then have a great day you
