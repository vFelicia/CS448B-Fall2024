00:03 - hey everybody
00:04 - welcome to live coding with jesse i'm
00:07 - jesse and today we're gonna do some css
00:11 - uh so
00:13 - not sass or
00:15 - css and js or anything like that just
00:18 - regular
00:19 - css this should be a great stream for
00:23 - beginners
00:24 - because usually if you want to get into
00:26 - web development you start out with
00:29 - html
00:30 - and css
00:32 - so
00:35 - i hope that we have no technical issues
00:38 - with the stream i can see my mic is
00:40 - working today
00:41 - and so far i've not dropped any frames
00:44 - so this might be the first
00:46 - successful stream uh from my my home
00:50 - office which is actually just a corner
00:52 - of my laundry room in my basement right
00:54 - now
00:56 - but don't not going to do a lengthy
00:59 - introduction i think you know we'll just
01:01 - get started i do want to show off my my
01:04 - t-shirt
01:06 - so this is the november
01:09 - t-shirt
01:10 - from the conference at the 2017 november
01:14 - conference so
01:15 - i thought it was pretty cool
01:17 - they had cool stuff there
01:19 - i know uh you've seen
01:22 - i think i've worn other stuff
01:24 - before or put it on instagram or
01:26 - something there's a t-shirt a hoodie
01:29 - a november hat
01:32 - uh i can get socks from that conference
01:35 - the socks were from heroku but
01:38 - anyway
01:40 - just wanted to show that off uh before
01:42 - we get started
01:44 - if you're new to the stream let me just
01:46 - give you a very quick rundown of how
01:48 - things go this stream is not exactly a
01:51 - tutorial uh instead this is my
01:53 - day-to-day work as a front-end developer
01:56 - for a small university
01:59 - so whatever i need to work on that day i
02:01 - just pick whatever i think will be the
02:03 - most interesting thing and then i stream
02:05 - it
02:06 - for about an hour or so
02:09 - but i take breaks to answer questions
02:11 - and i try to narrate what i'm doing
02:14 - so that you know hopefully it's
02:16 - beneficial to you all that watch and
02:18 - then you can give me
02:20 - you know your your feedback and and your
02:22 - help and ideas as i go along so it ends
02:24 - up being very collaborative
02:27 - i time these with a pomodoro timer which
02:30 - means for 25 minutes i i mostly code and
02:34 - don't really look too much at the live
02:36 - chat then i take a little break and i
02:38 - answer questions to live chat then i go
02:40 - back and do another 25 minute session
02:43 - and then after that i go back and and
02:44 - the final part of the stream is just all
02:47 - question and answer
02:48 - and
02:49 - sometimes that takes a long time
02:51 - sometimes it doesn't it entirely depends
02:52 - on you and and your questions
02:55 - this is definitely beginner friendly
02:57 - feel free to ask any questions don't
02:59 - worry about you know if you think your
03:01 - question is is a silly question
03:04 - don't worry about it uh you know we're
03:06 - all trying to learn here and get better
03:08 - and we're always trying to be very
03:10 - helpful if somebody is being
03:12 - uh not very nice in the chat then
03:15 - i will talk to them about that i i've
03:18 - only had to ban somebody once
03:21 - uh so you know we've been doing these
03:23 - streams for almost a year now and so we
03:25 - have a pretty good track record of
03:27 - having you know kind of a positive
03:30 - uh experience here
03:32 - so
03:34 - having said that
03:36 - uh let's get started
03:39 - so i'm going to start my pomodoro clock
03:42 - and i'm going to start out by
03:45 - just showing you what's
03:47 - uh what we're going to work on so i want
03:49 - to go to the
03:52 - major.js page if you all want to follow
03:55 - along uh where you know at home you can
03:58 - go to the github repository that's
04:00 - linked in the description to this video
04:04 - and
04:07 - check out this major.js component that's
04:10 - in the pages folder
04:12 - that's where we're going to spend most
04:14 - of our time well i take that back we're
04:17 - probably going to create a css file and
04:19 - that's where we're going to spend most
04:20 - of our time so
04:22 - it's probably not a bad idea to see if
04:24 - we already have one
04:25 - style
04:27 - that would be under
04:28 - static
04:30 - styles
04:32 - no we don't so we we actually don't have
04:34 - a css file for this component so that's
04:37 - kind of nice we'll start from a blank
04:39 - one
04:40 - and
04:42 - now i'm going to let you see what we
04:44 - need to style it's it's a little bit
04:46 - tricky
04:49 - so we have a lot of freedom with what
04:52 - we're going to turn this into
04:58 - oops
04:59 - let me switch the scene
05:02 - so you all can see
05:07 - and
05:12 - oops
05:17 - there we go
05:19 - okay
05:22 - all right so this
05:25 - is what we currently have this is the
05:27 - the current site that we're redoing
05:31 - so there's this
05:33 - thing here
05:34 - where user can click
05:37 - and
05:38 - get
05:39 - you know potentially what their schedule
05:41 - could be if they decided to come to the
05:43 - university and
05:45 - uh take
05:46 - uh be a classics major right so i got
05:50 - some feedback from some current students
05:53 - and they said that they really liked
05:54 - this
05:56 - and this helped them a lot when they
05:57 - were deciding so
05:59 - i do want to make this
06:01 - nicer
06:02 - this is what it looks like currently
06:06 - so we brought over all the markup
06:09 - and none of the styles
06:11 - so it's just a list
06:15 - so our goal today
06:17 - is to take this list
06:22 - and turn it into something
06:25 - that basically does this it does not
06:28 - have to look like this
06:30 - at all
06:31 - we can completely change how this looks
06:33 - the but it just needs to
06:36 - in a reasonable way that
06:39 - would be nice for a user it needs to be
06:42 - able to display the classes that would
06:44 - be taken during
06:46 - you know during their different years
06:48 - and semesters
06:51 - and
06:53 - we have to work with the existing markup
06:56 - so potentially i could change the markup
06:59 - but
07:00 - there's a lot and
07:03 - we're running out of time before
07:06 - you know launch time so i'm thinking
07:10 - so this probably needs to be launched
07:13 - sometime in
07:17 - maybe this month
07:20 - let me think hold on a second let me
07:23 - when's the first day of
07:25 - summer
07:28 - is it june
07:33 - yeah it's june right
07:35 - so let's let's
07:38 - figure the launch date is going to be
07:39 - sometime in early june
07:41 - uh kind of at the latest
07:44 - so anyway
07:46 - i would like to just work with the
07:47 - markup as is at a later date we can go
07:50 - back
07:51 - and if we want to change markup and
07:53 - organize the data in a better way that's
07:55 - fine but otherwise i've just brought
07:57 - this over
08:00 - as is and that's what we're gonna work
08:01 - with
08:04 - all right michael says june 21st okay
08:07 - i thought it was june
08:10 - i just realized i haven't looked at all
08:12 - at the uh chat since we started so
08:15 - i am going to go back and read this
08:18 - i just want to scan quickly to make sure
08:20 - there's nothing wrong with my stream
08:22 - that you are telling me about
08:44 - okay
08:47 - all right looks like everything's good
08:48 - with the stream
08:50 - so first thing we're going to do is just
08:52 - check out what we have in devtools let's
08:55 - inspect it
08:57 - now i know on some streams i i have
09:00 - a tool running called ngrok that allows
09:03 - you to inspect things on your own
09:06 - computer i don't have ngrok running
09:08 - right now for two reasons one i don't
09:10 - even have it installed or set up on this
09:12 - computer
09:13 - but also
09:15 - i don't think this computer could handle
09:17 - running ngrok and doing a live stream at
09:20 - the same time i would like to test it
09:22 - out at some point it would have been
09:24 - good for this type of stream but
09:27 - uh now it's kind of too late
09:29 - to try it out anyway i didn't really
09:31 - think about it until we already started
09:34 - all right so i'm gonna make this a bit
09:36 - bigger
09:41 - let's see
09:44 - so
09:45 - right now what i'm just looking for is
09:47 - like what markup are we are we dealing
09:50 - with here what does this look like
09:53 - uh so let's see it looks like
09:57 - classics all right so we have an h2 at
10:00 - the top
10:03 - this is good oh and then
10:06 - okay so these are also h2s
10:09 - not really happy about that i mean this
10:11 - is obviously the header for the whole
10:13 - thing so
10:14 - i would have liked it if these were
10:16 - maybe h3s or something but that's what
10:18 - we have and then these are in
10:21 - left title tags so
10:24 - what we've noticed previously that when
10:26 - we're bringing over data from this older
10:28 - content management system called ektron
10:31 - we have a lot of custom elements
10:34 - so this is one of those
10:36 - a left title all right we have break
10:39 - tags
10:41 - we have left
10:43 - interesting
10:46 - we have tags that are just left tags
10:53 - and then
10:54 - wow even all the courses are h2s with a
10:57 - class of title
11:01 - and then a link
11:03 - we have a link tag that has
11:06 - nothing in it
11:10 - it looks like
11:13 - we have display none set on a link which
11:16 - i mean that that obviously makes sense
11:17 - right
11:20 - um
11:21 - okay so i'm assuming we're gonna have
11:23 - some right tags here so let's check it
11:25 - out
11:26 - okay right title
11:28 - and we have some right tags
11:34 - okay this is not
11:35 - this is not terrible let's see if you
11:38 - are
11:40 - okay and then this is a link
11:42 - and i already set up this route so this
11:44 - link actually works
11:47 - so that's what i was doing earlier today
11:49 - i was just going through cleaning up
11:51 - data setting up routes which is what
11:53 - i've been doing pretty much every day
11:55 - the last couple weeks there's a lot to
11:57 - go through
11:59 - all right and then each one of these
12:02 - is in a tab
12:05 - okay uh
12:07 - i think this markup is something we can
12:09 - work with this doesn't look
12:12 - it doesn't look
12:14 - it could have been a lot worse right
12:16 - based on what we were seeing before
12:18 - it could have been worse
12:20 - so
12:22 - i think this will work
12:25 - we
12:26 - should be able to do what we need to do
12:28 - so
12:29 - right off the bat
12:31 - i'm going to tell you what i'm thinking
12:32 - about doing and then you all can give me
12:34 - your feedback and and see if um
12:37 - if you have any you know any input maybe
12:40 - i'm missing something
12:41 - so
12:42 - i mean obviously i'm i'm going to use
12:44 - these
12:46 - left tags
12:49 - and left title
12:50 - for that's where i'm going to attach the
12:53 - positioning to so in our cr css we're
12:55 - going to target these and position them
12:59 - to the left or to the right
13:02 - since there's no like containers
13:07 - i'm thinking this is going to be tough
13:17 - yeah there's no containers around all
13:19 - this which is going to make it a little
13:20 - bit tough
13:22 - maybe we'll just do like old-fashioned
13:24 - floats
13:26 - and see if that works for our right and
13:29 - our left i mean normally i would go with
13:31 - something else
13:32 - but that's going to be maybe my first
13:35 - try
13:37 - and then
13:38 - it looks like these br tags are just way
13:41 - too much space so we may
13:43 - end up
13:46 - just setting these to like display none
13:49 - or something like that
13:51 - let's take it out
13:53 - okay
13:54 - yeah if we set display none on those
13:59 - that's that's a lot nicer
14:02 - alright so just like that that
14:04 - automatically looks more reasonable
14:06 - we're also going to have to change
14:09 - some of the styles
14:11 - on like these titles for semesters and
14:14 - years so right now there's no visual
14:16 - hierarchy in terms of
14:19 - font size font weight color or
14:21 - indentation
14:23 - so
14:23 - all that's going to have to change
14:29 - and then the the link styling will
14:31 - change this is just default link styling
14:34 - uh so we'll we'll switch that up but
14:38 - other than that it's not
14:41 - it's not really terrible uh
14:45 - yeah i don't think that's too bad
14:48 - we'll get that all figured out and then
14:50 - we'll see what it looks like with just
14:51 - having first year first semester
14:54 - and then side by side and then doing the
14:57 - same thing here
14:59 - and then we'll see like do we want to go
15:01 - back to some sort of tabbed version
15:04 - is it okay to just have them all right
15:05 - there
15:07 - i'm not really sure i want to see it
15:08 - first
15:09 - all right so let me look at the live
15:11 - chat since i've been asking a few
15:12 - questions here and see
15:15 - see what you all think
15:26 - all right i see i see a lot of questions
15:28 - in the chat right now so i will get to
15:30 - the questions so um
15:33 - in about
15:36 - about 15 minutes i'll get to the
15:38 - questions so please be patient
15:55 - let's see
16:05 - uh how many says so we'll not modify the
16:07 - html at all
16:09 - if
16:11 - potentially we can modify the html but
16:13 - if we do it it's going to be
16:15 - using javascript in the react component
16:19 - because
16:20 - i have a lot of pages that have markup
16:23 - just like this so i don't want to have
16:25 - to manually go in and and modify it
16:32 - oh and it har should just explain that
16:34 - so sorry i didn't see that okay well it
16:36 - looks like we're good to start in on
16:38 - this so
16:39 - first thing i want to do is is try to
16:41 - get this positioning uh working
16:45 - so let's go
16:47 - you know what let's just try to do a
16:48 - little bit right here in dev tools
16:53 - if you're very new uh to
16:56 - using you know dev tools
16:58 - you know if you just right click on
17:00 - anything in the page and then go down to
17:02 - inspect dev tools will come up if you've
17:05 - never used it before it'll come up and
17:07 - it'll be white instead of a black
17:08 - background you can just go into the
17:10 - settings up here
17:12 - and
17:13 - you can change that to a dark background
17:15 - if you want
17:17 - right so all the changes we're going to
17:18 - do here are just going to be temporary
17:20 - they're only working our browser so you
17:22 - don't have to worry about actually
17:23 - changing or messing up the code and you
17:25 - could do this for any website that you
17:27 - go on uh to just kind of mess with it
17:29 - and see how it works
17:30 - so we're going to take our left tags and
17:34 - let's see actually let me go with the
17:36 - right ones first
17:37 - let's see
17:39 - no i don't
17:41 - with the left
17:44 - so let's try a float left
17:47 - see how weird it looks
17:49 - all right so what did we just
17:53 - we just took all
17:55 - nope that's not gonna work
17:58 - you know what i didn't even think about
17:59 - that
18:03 - okay
18:04 - uh
18:06 - so let's leave that alone for now let's
18:07 - take our right ones
18:09 - let's see what we can do
18:13 - oh harsha says there's 101 people
18:15 - watching which is more i well i haven't
18:18 - even looked at the analytics at all
18:20 - wow
18:22 - so we're we're at 85 right now based on
18:24 - my analytics but that's still a lot of
18:26 - people so um forever new people uh
18:29 - welcome thanks for thanks for watching
18:32 - feel free to put any questions you have
18:33 - in the chat and uh i'll answer them
18:35 - after a little while
18:37 - all right so let's go with our our right
18:39 - tags
18:41 - and
18:43 - let's see what we can do
18:44 - so
18:48 - let's see what we can do
18:54 - hmm
18:59 - so i'm obviously the float's not gonna
19:01 - work right so if we do float right
19:04 - right we're gonna get some weirdness
19:06 - again
19:08 - uh so
19:09 - float is out for what we're doing right
19:11 - now but we could maybe do
19:19 - let's mess with the position oops and
19:21 - that did not
19:27 - position
19:30 - uh absolute
19:32 - no this is not
19:35 - this is gonna be trickier than i thought
19:38 - so the lack of a container
19:41 - is really
19:43 - messing this up
19:59 - all right
20:01 - one thing we can do
20:02 - is see what they used here in the old
20:05 - site
20:07 - assuming that they have the uh the same
20:11 - elements on the page
20:15 - all right
20:17 - oh so this ended up getting interpreted
20:19 - as
20:20 - ul
20:22 - uh unordered list wow
20:26 - okay so it looks like the old content
20:28 - management system
20:31 - took those those custom tags and
20:34 - converted them to
20:36 - normal html tags
20:39 - and ended up
20:41 - wrapping these
20:45 - so think of
20:47 - think of these
20:49 - as like components in react
20:52 - so
20:54 - no actually that doesn't make any sense
20:56 - either
21:01 - i'm not exactly sure how that that
21:03 - worked out because
21:06 - you know there's really not
21:08 - any type of container
21:20 - interesting okay let's start with
21:22 - something easier while we think about
21:25 - how we can do
21:26 - uh how we can do this
21:28 - let's just get
21:29 - uh the headings
21:33 - fixed in terms of
21:35 - uh the size font weight and color
21:41 - i have some ideas for how to handle the
21:43 - positioning
21:45 - but it's going to involve some
21:46 - javascript so i'd rather stick to css
21:49 - for now since that's what i
21:51 - i made the title of this video so i
21:52 - imagine there's a lot of people here for
21:54 - the css
21:56 - so let's do some css then
21:58 - and
21:59 - where are we at sample programs this h2
22:03 - is
22:06 - let's check we don't want it to be too
22:09 - much larger than this so let's look up
22:11 - what we have on this
22:13 - h1
22:15 - okay so we don't have anything special
22:16 - it's just default
22:24 - so probably not not really a bad idea to
22:26 - just keep it as is for now
22:29 - since it's it's the appropriate size and
22:32 - weight in relation to this
22:35 - but these
22:37 - h2s
22:44 - that's why
22:47 - i have an extra title here
22:54 - it's really interesting
22:57 - okay
22:58 - um
23:00 - wow these do not stand out at all
23:11 - all right we're gonna do some weird css
23:13 - here for a second
23:24 - so
23:27 - i'm going to write this
23:30 - let's set up our css
23:32 - our file
23:34 - so we have our styles right now
23:37 - in fact we use are we pulling in any
23:40 - styles
23:42 - okay we're actually pulling in the
23:43 - styles from news.css
23:47 - so you may want to pull
23:49 - those styles over
23:50 - let's make a new file first and we'll
23:52 - call this major.css
23:56 - to match our component of major.css
23:59 - let's check out our news.css
24:04 - and
24:05 - you know what let me make some more
24:07 - space here let's move this over because
24:09 - we're not really using it right now
24:11 - and we'll move our our terminal stuff
24:14 - down
24:17 - and then i'm gonna make this a bit
24:19 - bigger so it'll be easier for you all to
24:21 - see
24:23 - okay hopefully that
24:26 - is uh easier to see
24:28 - so what i'm gonna do is take everything
24:30 - that's currently in news dot css and i'm
24:33 - going to move it over to major
24:35 - dot css because i'm not sure what in
24:38 - this file
24:39 - is really making a difference in our our
24:42 - major uh
24:43 - js component so i'm going to save that
24:46 - let's go over to our component
24:50 - of major
24:52 - dot js
24:55 - sorry that for the lag it's just you're
24:58 - trying to run the live stream and
24:59 - everything else makes it a little slow
25:04 - so
25:05 - we're right now we're bringing in if you
25:08 - don't know what's going on in this
25:10 - particular component don't worry about
25:12 - it if you're not familiar with react you
25:14 - know
25:15 - it's it's totally cool if you don't
25:16 - understand but we're basically just
25:19 - importing
25:20 - styles all right with a link tag so that
25:23 - should be you know familiar to you from
25:25 - just you know writing normal html
25:28 - so we're going to pull in this major
25:31 - dot css file
25:35 - so now
25:36 - anything that we change here will be
25:38 - reflected
25:42 - ah
25:43 - let's see
25:44 - so let's go through this just a bit
25:49 - i'm gonna say okay so right now anything
25:52 - that is displaying is uh root
25:55 - gets display none
25:58 - and we did have something that was roots
26:01 - or was it
26:03 - i thought we had something yeah so
26:07 - it's root tabbed
26:11 - all right
26:13 - um we have
26:15 - probably some of these will be
26:21 - we won't necessarily uh need to keep
26:24 - them but we'll sort that out
26:26 - later on right now let's add some more
26:29 - styles to the bottom so
26:31 - what i want to target are h2s with the
26:34 - class of title
26:37 - so h2s dot
26:39 - title
26:42 - and then i want to say
26:48 - not
26:50 - um what do you want to do this
26:53 - is it first first of type
27:01 - i might have to look up the syntax
27:03 - so what i want to select is all the h2s
27:07 - that have
27:08 - the class of title
27:13 - except
27:14 - not
27:15 - oh you know what
27:20 - i was mistaken this h2 is just stacked
27:22 - so this one doesn't have the class of
27:23 - title
27:24 - so we're gonna we're good then
27:26 - okay that makes this a lot easier
27:32 - so normally i'm not
27:35 - i don't like manipulating h2s
27:40 - uh we still want this title
27:44 - so for in css what we're doing is
27:48 - selecting an h2
27:50 - and then we do dot title
27:52 - this right after that that means any h2s
27:55 - with the class of title
27:59 - if i had a space here
28:01 - this would mean
28:02 - any
28:03 - element with the class of title that
28:06 - exists inside of an h2 so you could see
28:09 - the little tooltip is displaying
28:12 - what it would be but now if we backspace
28:14 - it you can see we're looking for h2s
28:17 - with the class of title and only h2s
28:21 - okay so i know for most of you that's
28:22 - probably
28:23 - you know you're probably familiar with
28:25 - that but i i do want to try to explain
28:27 - as much as i can you know for anybody
28:29 - that's just just curious about
28:31 - web development
28:33 - uh just starting out
28:36 - so right now we're we're targeting
28:39 - these year titles so this first year
28:42 - you know second second year
28:46 - um
28:47 - so we want to make this
28:57 - so let's just test it out here
29:01 - font size
29:04 - 18 pixels
29:06 - okay so we're going to go up from there
29:09 - and let's
29:10 - see let's say 24 pixels
29:14 - i really don't want to go any more than
29:16 - 24 pixels on this one and we could do
29:19 - font weight
29:24 - and let's see
29:26 - 500
29:28 - okay 500 looks good that definitely
29:30 - makes it thinner
29:32 - and then
29:34 - can we do color
29:37 - let's make our color be rgba
29:41 - and we're going to use
29:43 - 0 0 0
29:46 - um
29:48 - 0.87
29:52 - oops i need commas don't i
29:55 - zero
29:56 - zero
30:00 - okay
30:02 - so i wasn't sure if that was the color
30:04 - or not
30:06 - but that's what color i want okay so
30:10 - let's go with that for now
30:13 - and also
30:14 - we need to remember to
30:17 - make those those br tags work so major
30:20 - route 239 br
30:23 - all right so we're definitely gonna have
30:24 - to override this
30:27 - style where is it getting that from
30:30 - that's weird
30:32 - okay so we're copy and pasting that in
30:34 - here
30:36 - and
30:38 - let's just
30:43 - want to fix the
30:46 - indentation on that and then uh
30:51 - let's go with vr
30:54 - display
31:02 - i hate to use important but let's just
31:04 - do it
31:11 - just for time i don't really want to go
31:12 - through this and try to figure out what
31:14 - exactly is going on with this so just to
31:16 - see what it looks like we're gonna go
31:17 - with uh
31:18 - important
31:20 - in there so
31:23 - um let's do a refresh
31:27 - make sure it's working
31:29 - all right cool so now we have
31:32 - we have that and my timer went off so
31:34 - let me take a short break
31:36 - and answer as many questions as i can
31:38 - there's a lot of questions here so if i
31:40 - don't get to yours this time i'll get to
31:42 - it after the second pomodoro session
31:44 - i'll spend the the entire end of the
31:46 - stream just answering questions
31:51 - let's see so i'm not going to read out
31:53 - all the comments just because there's so
31:56 - much in here uh
32:00 - do want to get uh to the questions
32:02 - though
32:06 - although i'll probably read out comments
32:07 - that are
32:09 - either
32:11 - maybe funny or flattering to me
32:13 - personally
32:15 - so
32:17 - for instance klaus says i look way
32:19 - better with the stubble instead of the
32:21 - beard
32:22 - thanks
32:24 - my wife agrees
32:30 - world's asked if i'm in the basement i
32:32 - am i am coding from a corner of my
32:35 - basement
32:37 - uh nilish asks when i'll continue the
32:40 - react testing video uh maybe later this
32:42 - week i was doing i was reading a lot of
32:45 - documentation on testing and i still
32:47 - could not figure out
32:49 - what
32:50 - i have to do
32:52 - uh for the the click
32:58 - i
32:59 - i i don't i'll i have to talk about this
33:01 - for like 20 minutes or not at all so i
33:04 - will do another stream about it when i
33:06 - figure it out
33:08 - uh remy asks how many monitors
33:10 - i have uh right now i have a macbook pro
33:13 - so there's a screen with that and then
33:14 - two external monitors hooked up
33:17 - and that's my setup at my offices as
33:19 - well except it's an imac and then two
33:21 - external monitors
33:23 - the most i've ever used is four monitors
33:25 - that was a really cool setup i'd like to
33:27 - go back to that eventually
33:33 - and it says i look younger without the
33:34 - beard yeah i definitely everybody keeps
33:37 - saying that that i look younger and you
33:39 - probably can't see it on the live stream
33:41 - but i have gray hair in my beard so i
33:44 - definitely look younger because i don't
33:46 - i don't yet have any gray hair like on
33:48 - the top of my head
33:51 - so uh yeah definitely younger
33:55 - solely says shout out from south africa
33:58 - thanks for watching
33:59 - uh thanks for the shout out
34:03 - john says uh it is usually a good idea
34:05 - to draw out a plan what divs hold what
34:08 - headings and some sense of functional ui
34:10 - ux
34:11 - yeah for sure uh normally i'm like right
34:14 - now we're kind of stuck with this markup
34:16 - so normally i wouldn't start like this
34:18 - but
34:20 - many of you if you're actually going to
34:21 - work will probably find yourself in a
34:23 - situation where you don't have control
34:25 - over the markup
34:27 - but you need to style it as best you can
34:30 - and what we're doing now is kind of a
34:33 - good example of how you handle that
34:36 - uh
34:38 - how memory says pure css no bootstrap
34:40 - yep no no bootstrap or nothing
34:44 - yeah we so
34:46 - on the components themselves we have
34:47 - styles from material ui but what we're
34:50 - when we're doing this
34:54 - in terms of like styling the markup
34:55 - that's been imported from the other cms
34:58 - it's it's pretty much all from scratch
35:05 - uh how many asked what material ui is uh
35:08 - it's a um
35:09 - a ui framework for react
35:13 - that uses uh material design principles
35:27 - the lone wolf says can anyone explain
35:28 - what br and link does
35:31 - the br tags are html tags that are
35:35 - supposed to include a line break and
35:37 - potentially like some space in between
35:40 - lines
35:41 - but
35:42 - really it's better to use css for that
35:44 - like margins padding and things like
35:46 - that so
35:47 - uh i
35:49 - very rarely use a break tag
35:52 - uh
35:53 - you know now it
35:54 - correct me if i'm wrong but those were
35:56 - kind of really an older thing
35:59 - that you just you don't really do that
36:01 - much anymore
36:03 - and then the link tag
36:06 - i don't know what they're doing with the
36:07 - link tag in here in terms of what got
36:09 - imported from the old cms but link tags
36:12 - are supposed to be to pull in css files
36:16 - uh
36:17 - saatvik says what does the left tag do
36:19 - it really doesn't do anything right now
36:21 - until we assign it some sort of styles
36:24 - it was a custom tag that did have some
36:26 - meaning in the old content management
36:28 - system but doesn't currently
36:31 - in a new system
36:35 - uh javier says is this a semantic html
36:38 - horrible on purpose
36:42 - i don't know what the designers of that
36:44 - old cms were thinking if they wanted it
36:46 - to be like that on purpose or not
36:49 - uh
36:50 - i don't think i'll ever get a chance to
36:52 - ask him so we may never know all right
36:54 - so my timer went off i'm going to go
36:56 - back and
36:57 - start another pomodoro session and then
36:59 - i'm going to come back to the chat and
37:01 - keep going from where i left off
37:04 - which is
37:06 - i don't think i have a pen or anything
37:08 - here
37:09 - all right so
37:10 - the timestamp for me for where i left
37:13 - off is 2 45 p.m in the chat so
37:16 - let's try to remember 2 45 p.m
37:19 - i bet i can just write it here yeah
37:23 - let's just
37:31 - all right so in my terminal i write 245
37:35 - to remember that that's there
37:38 - and then i'll remember where to go okay
37:39 - so we've got our h2s with the class of
37:43 - title style
37:44 - and we've gotten rid of those
37:47 - those break tags well i i shouldn't say
37:49 - we got rid of them they're still there
37:50 - we're just not displaying them
37:58 - okay so now here's what we have
38:02 - we definitely need to style these
38:05 - and these right we
38:07 - if we're going with a hierarchy here
38:10 - uh it's not
38:12 - it's not looking good so far
38:14 - so our left title and right title are
38:17 - going to get the same styles in terms of
38:19 - font and color
38:21 - so let's test out
38:23 - what we think will look good
38:27 - uh
38:28 - so we'll go with a font size of
38:33 - let's say
38:34 - 20
38:38 - all right 20 pixels a little bit bigger
38:41 - and
38:42 - do we want a different font weight
38:49 - let's see what we want so the last one
38:51 - was what 500 let's try a 400 font weight
38:54 - which is going to be pretty light
38:57 - okay not bad and then let's take that
39:00 - color
39:02 - we want that same
39:04 - color
39:06 - of r
39:08 - g
39:09 - r g b a
39:12 - so
39:13 - this rgba that i'm putting in here
39:17 - if we just did the zero zero zero that
39:20 - would give us pure black
39:22 - but instead we're doing this 0.87
39:26 - all right and that that last one is like
39:29 - the the opacity
39:32 - so
39:33 - what we're doing
39:36 - is essentially making a grayish color
39:39 - but we're not putting a gray hex value
39:41 - in
39:42 - text is actually more readable if you do
39:45 - solid black
39:47 - and you make it a little bit transparent
39:50 - to get your gray if you do a gray hex
39:52 - value
39:53 - it's less readable so i'm not going to
39:54 - do it right now like to demonstrate but
39:58 - you know try it out on your own and try
40:00 - them side by side
40:01 - you'll be amazed at the difference
40:05 - okay
40:06 - so that's not bad it still looks weird
40:07 - because we haven't styled these yet but
40:09 - you know i think we're on the right
40:11 - track so let's copy this
40:14 - and we'll go over to our our file here
40:18 - and
40:22 - let's do left
40:25 - what was that left title yeah left title
40:30 - and
40:31 - we're gonna do
40:32 - um right
40:35 - title
40:38 - so since we put this comma in here
40:41 - it's going to add the same styles
40:46 - for both of these
40:49 - so let's save that
40:51 - just to make sure that styles are
40:53 - applying across the board
41:00 - there we are okay so we have the same
41:02 - styles all the way down good
41:04 - now let's see what we're working with
41:07 - for for these
41:09 - each one of these
41:11 - all right
41:13 - oh goodness
41:14 - um
41:16 - all right this is not too bad so we want
41:18 - to target all h2s that have a class of
41:21 - title that live within a left tag or a
41:24 - right tag
41:26 - so uh we can we can definitely do that
41:29 - so let's
41:32 - let's do this over here it's going to be
41:34 - a little
41:37 - tricky to do it in dev tools
41:40 - not not impossible but
41:42 - let's just do it over here so let's do a
41:44 - left tag
41:45 - and let's say h2
41:48 - title
41:50 - and then let's do a write tag
41:52 - and then we'll say h2
41:54 - title
41:56 - so this
41:57 - will target what we wanted to target we
41:59 - could hover over that so any h2s with a
42:01 - class of title that are within a left
42:04 - tag or
42:06 - a right tag
42:07 - and that's what we're going to go with
42:09 - here and let's
42:11 - based on what we've seen with the other
42:13 - things we styled we can pretty much
42:15 - guess without even looking what's going
42:17 - to work so let's do a font size
42:20 - of 18 pixels
42:24 - and we'll do a font
42:29 - weight
42:31 - and we're going to keep it at that 400
42:34 - pixels if you start to go below below
42:36 - 400
42:38 - it gets a little bit difficult to read
42:41 - if you have a nice screen
42:43 - it's okay and it actually looks really
42:45 - good
42:46 - but for users that have older screens
42:48 - it's
42:49 - it's very hard to to read so
42:53 - although aesthetically i really like how
42:55 - it looks
42:56 - i mean from
42:58 - just out of respect for a lot of the
43:00 - users that may not have
43:01 - you know high definition screens
43:04 - i'm not i'm going to very rarely go
43:06 - below 400 unless we're talking about
43:09 - large font
43:10 - sizes and so finally uh we're going to
43:14 - make the color
43:16 - let's just copy and paste so we don't
43:18 - have to type that out again but i want
43:20 - to try it with
43:22 - a lighter gray color
43:24 - because we need
43:26 - i think we need some differentiation
43:28 - here
43:29 - because we have a lot of
43:31 - levels going on so let's try 54.
43:35 - usually the values i end up using are
43:37 - either 87 or 54. never pure black
43:40 - um
43:42 - and this will give us a lighter gray
43:44 - color that'll still be readable
43:47 - so
43:48 - let me refresh i do have like auto auto
43:51 - refresh set up here but since the
43:55 - uh there's a bit of lag here it's kind
43:57 - of running a little slow from the live
43:59 - stream i just
44:00 - keep doing this you know manually
44:03 - okay
44:06 - so let me zoom in here it's easy to see
44:08 - so right now
44:11 - we do have
44:16 - this font weight looks a little big
44:21 - left h2 title that's interesting why
44:25 - is this
44:33 - did i mess it up
44:35 - oops i put pixels in the font weight
44:38 - uh i'm sure some of you already caught
44:40 - that and put it in the uh in the live
44:42 - chat so sorry if i didn't glance over
44:44 - there but yeah that's
44:47 - can't put pixels in the font weight it's
44:49 - just a regular
44:51 - you know number
44:52 - okay
44:53 - that that looks nicer so this what we
44:56 - have right now uh not too bad
44:59 - well we forgot to style
45:02 - this
45:03 - i'm not that worried about styling that
45:05 - so i'm going to leave that alone for now
45:07 - and let's see so we'll come to the page
45:11 - i just kind of wanted like zoom out and
45:12 - just see
45:13 - the the big picture here so we come to
45:15 - the page we see the mission aims
45:19 - okay and now we go down sample program
45:22 - classics first year first semester
45:25 - second semesters
45:32 - okay
45:34 - it's it's a bit much
45:37 - it is a bit much you know what i wonder
45:40 - let's shrink this down and see what it
45:42 - would look like on a small screen like
45:44 - on a phone
45:46 - uh
45:47 - let's see
45:50 - it's not too bad i think there needs to
45:52 - be uh some some work with the padding
45:56 - and the margins here so we need you know
45:58 - better spacing so it doesn't all run
46:01 - together
46:03 - and i think we don't need
46:05 - links for each one of these so
46:08 - for this
46:10 - oh
46:14 - so for this one
46:15 - it has it here because this whole thing
46:18 - changes
46:20 - when you click it so that's why it keeps
46:22 - repeating that link
46:24 - so we don't need to do that i do want to
46:26 - see what what happens when this goes
46:28 - small
46:31 - okay interesting
46:37 - all right so it it it doesn't display
46:39 - them all
46:41 - but it still has this kind of
46:44 - uh stacked look within each one
46:47 - okay
46:53 - all right not
46:54 - it's not terrible
46:57 - i don't think we're gonna get into doing
46:59 - anything like this
47:02 - right now
47:04 - but i'm gonna keep that open as kind of
47:06 - a possibility here
47:13 - okay
47:15 - all right so let's go back to what we
47:16 - have here
47:18 - and
47:28 - all right let's see where this
47:34 - oops
47:39 - where this is
47:40 - let's inspect that
47:42 - and
47:43 - okay view all
47:44 - so this is within a view all tag
47:48 - and
47:56 - classics classes text
48:04 - that's really weird i don't want it to
48:05 - say that um
48:07 - i don't know why it says that
48:12 - okay so let's take
48:15 - these view all tags
48:21 - and
48:31 - which one are we going to
48:38 - i wonder if we could
48:46 - all right let me let me just get over
48:47 - what i'm kind of thinking now
48:49 - uh so i'm thinking
48:53 - we definitely don't need
48:56 - the same link four times on the page
49:00 - we really just need it one time
49:05 - oh
49:06 - excuse me
49:09 - we need to link one time and my thought
49:11 - was okay well let me hide all of them
49:13 - except for
49:14 - one but i also had a thought that you
49:18 - know the
49:19 - the url for this is going to be pretty
49:22 - predictable it's just going to be
49:26 - classics and classes so potentially we
49:29 - could just put into our
49:32 - indoor component
49:35 - another element there in our component
49:38 - to display it and it can just
49:40 - add in
49:43 - are our slug right for that particular
49:46 - uh page
49:48 - into here
49:50 - and just build the url like that the
49:52 - benefit of doing it that way is that we
49:54 - can use link prefetching
49:57 - so right now this is built in so if i
50:00 - click this we're going to get a page
50:02 - refresh so let's let's see
50:04 - see we get a page refresh
50:09 - which obviously takes longer
50:15 - so we don't really want that
50:19 - yeah so let's do it let's do it like
50:21 - that so
50:23 - first things first let's
50:25 - take view all
50:27 - and we're going to say
50:30 - let's just put it right here with this
50:32 - br
50:39 - all right so view all is gonna be
50:41 - display none
50:43 - and then
50:44 - we'll just put in and that's also gonna
50:47 - solve the problem of the uh the text
50:50 - here
50:51 - being weird like classics classes text
50:53 - doesn't really say to the user what's
50:55 - going to be on that page
51:03 - so i guess i'll have to refresh
51:06 - my auto refresh is just not happening
51:09 - all right there we go so we've gotten
51:11 - rid of that
51:14 - and just to add this in
51:19 - i guess we could add this in quickly let
51:20 - me see how much time i have 10 minutes
51:22 - okay
51:23 - that's enough time we can go back to our
51:25 - major.js
51:28 - and we could see what we're going to get
51:30 - is
51:31 - the id
51:32 - our id i believe is what we're going to
51:34 - want
51:36 - and that would be classics right
51:45 - all right so let's go down here
51:53 - our query
51:54 - is bringing in all this data
52:01 - so after that
52:07 - yeah we can put our
52:09 - other element after that
52:11 - so
52:14 - let's just add a link tag
52:16 - and make sure we've imported our link
52:18 - tag
52:20 - and we have not
52:26 - maybe we can just copy and paste it from
52:29 - an existing component
52:31 - so i know we have
52:37 - the
52:38 - drawer item.js is doing this
52:41 - so
52:45 - we're gonna import link from next link
52:47 - so this part here is getting a little
52:49 - bit more advanced uh we're using react
52:52 - so if you're not familiar with this uh
52:54 - don't worry about it this is definitely
52:56 - not css stuff
52:58 - but i'm just gonna copy and paste a few
53:00 - things
53:01 - just to save time and then we're gonna
53:03 - get back to our css
53:06 - so let's get our link
53:21 - okay
53:23 - and
53:26 - link
53:28 - there we go so
53:36 - all right this will get auto formatted i
53:38 - know it looks weird now but we don't
53:40 - need a key
53:43 - for this
53:45 - oops
53:47 - and
53:48 - we can put
53:51 - no we're going to put that in manually
53:53 - yeah let's do um
53:57 - so this is going to be
54:01 - uh
54:02 - template literal
54:04 - so
54:06 - template literal is when you want to put
54:08 - in a string but you want to also have
54:10 - some javascript in there as well it
54:12 - makes it a lot easier than having to do
54:14 - a normal string and then concatenate uh
54:18 - that together with plus signs
54:20 - with some some javascript
54:24 - so what we want to do is just put um
54:29 - oops
54:30 - let's do
54:31 - [Music]
54:32 - this first part is going to be our
54:37 - our id so this
54:39 - props
54:41 - id actually did we deconstruct
54:48 - yeah this props id okay
54:51 - uh so we have this props id and i forgot
54:55 - i forgot this
54:57 - so when we want to use javascript we put
54:59 - a dollar sign and some curly brackets
55:02 - and then after the next curly bracket we
55:04 - drop right back into stringland and we
55:06 - can just put the string which is
55:09 - which is classes
55:11 - all right so
55:14 - that's what works here
55:16 - uh and let's see
55:21 - let's look over here i'm glad we have
55:23 - this open
55:24 - uh so we did have some weirdness going
55:27 - on where
55:29 - uh we needed
55:31 - we needed to add some things and as page
55:34 - type academics and pages
55:37 - let's
55:38 - let's pull this in
55:41 - just to see
55:49 - okay so
55:52 - are we pulling this in
55:53 - [Music]
55:54 - pulling this in his page
55:58 - is it really paige are we doing this as
56:05 - i
56:06 - think we're doing these classes as a
56:08 - major
56:11 - type
56:20 - nope it's
56:32 - no
56:34 - major
56:36 - id
56:39 - classes
56:41 - uh id is gonna be
56:49 - this props id
56:52 - oops
56:53 - and then
56:55 - hyphen
56:58 - let's change this to template
57:01 - literal
57:03 - syntax
57:08 - oops
57:13 - i'm gonna explain what i'm doing here in
57:14 - just a second
57:16 - and hope that it works uh it's just
57:19 - gonna be
57:25 - course descriptions
57:36 - all right let's save
57:38 - that okay so
57:41 - assuming this is gonna work which i'm
57:43 - assuming here is that uh we're adding in
57:46 - uh the url
57:49 - that'll be seen in the in the browser
57:50 - but we're also adding in this
57:52 - as and this is going to send some data
57:56 - to our
57:59 - um
58:00 - to our router
58:02 - and enable this link to act as
58:04 - client-side routing
58:07 - so
58:09 - that's why we're we're kind of doing
58:10 - this uh if you want to know why we do it
58:13 - like this check out
58:15 - show me what
58:18 - issue or pull request
58:23 - you know what if anybody's interested in
58:25 - the why let me know in the live chat and
58:26 - i will take the time to look up where
58:29 - the you can get more info about this in
58:31 - the repository
58:32 - uh otherwise if nobody's really
58:34 - interested then
58:35 - i'm not going to look it up right now
58:37 - but let's let's see if this even works
58:48 - there we go course descriptions
59:13 - yeah not working
59:17 - i did the wrong thing
59:45 - maybe i should check the server to see
59:47 - if i'm using uh the correct
59:53 - correct words here so
60:00 - majors all right
60:02 - this could be a problem
60:08 - majors
60:13 - all right let's see if that makes a
60:15 - difference
60:25 - uh you know what i flipped them around
60:28 - that's what i was worried about okay so
60:30 - the as url needs to go is the href
60:34 - all right
60:34 - let's switch it
60:37 - i messed it up
60:40 - makes a lot more sense now all right so
60:43 - this needs to be as
60:45 - and this needs to be ahref
60:51 - all right
61:02 - okay now
61:06 - let me refresh make sure
61:08 - this actually went through
61:10 - so it shouldn't
61:15 - so what was happening is it was showing
61:17 - us all those parameters when we hovered
61:19 - over and that's not what it should show
61:21 - us it just shows something that looks
61:22 - like a normal url
61:26 - all right so this now is
61:29 - looking like a normal url
61:34 - and so i'm going to click this and see
61:36 - what happens yeah there we go all right
61:38 - so i don't know if you caught that but
61:41 - what happened was
61:42 - uh hopefully if you saw the last time we
61:44 - tried to load this page it took a while
61:48 - now it was very fast
61:51 - because we never refreshed the page it
61:52 - routed client-side so that's what we
61:54 - wanted to happen
61:56 - let's go back and click it one more time
61:58 - just to see
62:00 - very fast
62:01 - so it's using
62:03 - client-side routing it's using
62:05 - pre-fetching caching so this is going to
62:07 - make the speed just that much faster
62:11 - and
62:12 - because we did it like this
62:16 - where we we put in variables instead of
62:18 - hard-coding this this will now work
62:22 - for every
62:24 - major page
62:27 - so they'll all have this here
62:29 - uh now part of the problem let me see
62:32 - this
62:33 - is the
62:34 - we're gonna have
62:36 - this now at the bottom of here
62:38 - so we'll have to think about what we
62:39 - want to do with that you know maybe we
62:42 - don't have uh
62:44 - these type of things appear on a major
62:47 - page so
62:48 - we'll have to work that out
62:51 - but
62:52 - for now i
62:54 - it looks a lot better so
62:57 - this
63:00 - this is just such a huge improvement
63:02 - over what was there when we started
63:03 - remember we had these huge
63:06 - font sizes and font weights
63:09 - and the spacing was really weird
63:12 - so this is not perfect and it's not
63:15 - really how i want it to be ideally but
63:18 - let's say we ran out of time and didn't
63:20 - get to do anything else with this
63:22 - this is still readable
63:25 - it makes some kind of sense visually
63:28 - so
63:30 - that's
63:31 - i'm okay with that for
63:34 - you know for what it is for right now
63:38 - all right awesome so my timer went off
63:41 - and now for the rest of the stream
63:45 - i'm gonna do questions uh although i
63:47 - probably should commit this so that you
63:50 - all can see all the code i gotta
63:51 - remember 245 is where i left off
63:56 - so let's do a git status
63:59 - if you're not familiar with git this
64:01 - will be like a really really tiny uh
64:03 - basic tutorial so when we use git status
64:07 - is the command in our terminal
64:09 - it shows us that
64:11 - we've modified the major.js
64:14 - file and then we've added a major.css
64:17 - file that's exactly what we worked on so
64:19 - that's that's what i expected to see so
64:21 - that's good
64:23 - let's we need to add these files to the
64:25 - staging area now so we're going to do a
64:27 - git add and i want to add all the files
64:29 - so i'm just going to put a period there
64:32 - hit enter now if we do a git status
64:35 - you can see
64:37 - these are green now they're in the this
64:39 - they're staged right so they're ready to
64:42 - be committed
64:45 - and i'm gonna use this command called
64:46 - yarn cm this does not come with git by
64:48 - default this was in addition just to
64:50 - help us make uh nice commit messages so
64:54 - let's say uh we're gonna add a new
64:57 - feature
64:58 - and
64:59 - uh
65:00 - we're just gonna write a very short
65:01 - statement explaining what we did
65:04 - and we'll just say add
65:07 - styles for
65:09 - uh
65:10 - course for sample
65:16 - sample schedules
65:23 - sample class schedules so you want it to
65:26 - be short but descriptive enough that
65:28 - you'll be able or someone else will be
65:29 - able to go back and read it and say okay
65:32 - i know what that's about
65:35 - so think like one sentence
65:39 - sample class schedules great there we
65:41 - are and
65:44 - are there breaking changes no
65:47 - does it affect any open issues i believe
65:49 - it does
65:50 - let me see
65:52 - i don't think i have that open
65:54 - i do yes
65:56 - let's check out the issues here
65:58 - style sample program sections so that's
66:01 - issue 102.
66:05 - so let's uh say that yes it does affect
66:09 - an open issue
66:10 - and let's say it affects issue
66:14 - uh number 102.
66:19 - now it's going to run
66:22 - some tests
66:24 - and i actually uh i changed one thing in
66:26 - the repository and for those of you who
66:28 - are contributing this should help you
66:30 - out
66:31 - a long time ago just kind of for
66:33 - demonstration purposes i had set the
66:37 - end-to-end testing
66:38 - to
66:39 - not use the headless version of chrome
66:41 - browser so it actually popped up with a
66:43 - browser and you could see it going
66:44 - through the pages and then
66:48 - that was taking longer
66:50 - than it needed to so i went back and i
66:53 - set that to actually use the headless
66:55 - version and it cut the times about in
66:57 - half
66:59 - so if you had a slower computer your end
67:02 - end test might be timing out
67:04 - as they time out after 30 seconds i
67:06 - think so
67:08 - it should be better now if you download
67:11 - the latest changes
67:13 - uh i just committed them
67:15 - right before the stream started
67:18 - so hopefully that will help with with
67:20 - the time
67:22 - so sorry about that i just
67:25 - i didn't realize that
67:28 - i never switched it back
67:31 - which i should have because i could see
67:32 - it happening every time
67:34 - all right so let me go back while that's
67:36 - doing its thing
67:38 - i'm going to scroll back up to is that
67:40 - the timestamp 245
67:44 - and
67:45 - i'm going to answer as many questions as
67:47 - i can here
67:50 - i should be what time is it i should be
67:52 - able to get to all the questions
68:05 - let's see
68:11 - uh
68:12 - hermene says so we'll not modify the
68:14 - html at all uh no not if we can help it
68:23 - uh i'm not opposed to using javascript
68:25 - though to modify it uh so just like we
68:28 - did when we added in that that extra
68:31 - link tag
68:32 - if we do it in a way that could be used
68:35 - across the board on all components i'm
68:37 - okay with that
68:38 - alright so everything passed
68:40 - and
68:42 - now we can
68:44 - do a get push
68:47 - origin and that'll push all our changes
68:50 - right up to our master branch so
68:52 - if you want to check out what we've done
68:55 - you can see it now
68:57 - in our github repo
68:59 - everything is up to date
69:11 - all right so i am skipping over some of
69:13 - the questions because they were answered
69:14 - right away uh by other people in the
69:17 - chat so uh thank you uh for for
69:21 - answering so many questions you are
69:22 - being really helpful when and answering
69:24 - each other's questions
69:32 - well it is
69:33 - you know we did have a lot more people
69:35 - than normal today i don't know what it
69:36 - was uh for anybody who may be here
69:39 - that's not normally here
69:41 - uh could you let me know uh how did you
69:43 - hear about the stream and and what made
69:45 - you decide to watch it today i'm just
69:49 - i have no idea what's different today
69:52 - i mean i haven't checked any messages
69:54 - maybe i got retweeted by somebody with a
69:56 - lot of followers
69:58 - it doesn't even look like that though
70:00 - all right yeah so i'm not really sure
70:08 - uh yeah okay so him emmy is one of the
70:10 - new ones
70:11 - cool thanks for watching
70:16 - so i just heard one of my kids in the
70:17 - background
70:20 - all right he's talking to uh
70:22 - to my wife
70:26 - all right i missed it har [ __ ] had said
70:28 - uh he was gonna go to sleep so uh if you
70:31 - watch the end of this harsha thank you
70:32 - so much for all your help here and in
70:34 - the live chat answering questions and uh
70:36 - thank you for staying up so late in
70:38 - harsh it's time zone it's it's well
70:40 - after midnight um so
70:45 - what is it might be like
70:47 - yeah it's really late it's like the
70:49 - middle of the night
70:59 - i need to get some better lighting
71:01 - see my
71:03 - it's really dark in here all right
71:08 - uh lone wolf says i'm just done through
71:11 - css html bootstrap and the front end
71:13 - course is that enough for me to
71:15 - comprehend all of this
71:16 - um you could probably comprehend all the
71:19 - like the css stuff
71:21 - if you're not familiar with react it may
71:23 - be a little bit more difficult to get
71:25 - what's going on there
71:27 - but
71:29 - i try to do uh his best the best job
71:32 - that i can with explaining things along
71:33 - the way and you can ask you know feel
71:36 - free to ask questions so i'd say give it
71:38 - a shot uh if you find that it's really
71:40 - difficult to follow along then
71:42 - you know hey maybe maybe this stream at
71:44 - this point is not for you but i i do try
71:47 - to do a mix of things that are you know
71:49 - different
71:50 - types of things
71:52 - uh different levels so
71:54 - you know some of them might be good you
71:56 - know for you where you're at right now
71:58 - some of them you know maybe not
72:08 - oh yeah you know what phoenix has a good
72:10 - point
72:11 - um
72:12 - the uh the main benefit i could see to
72:15 - this stream is
72:17 - seeing what it's like for a front-end
72:19 - developer
72:20 - to actually work through issues on a
72:23 - project have things break
72:26 - uh problems come up and you know try to
72:29 - try to just work through it and fix it
72:32 - also the ability to ask questions with
72:34 - so many you know really knowledgeable
72:36 - developers here in the live chat
72:39 - is is good as well
72:41 - um so
72:43 - in the sense of this being like a
72:44 - tutorial for
72:46 - let's say react or anything
72:48 - it's not really that uh but it it can
72:51 - give some
72:53 - i
72:54 - i mean i think it gets some good
72:55 - experiences to you know what do you do
72:57 - when things don't work
72:58 - uh when you have deadlines you know what
73:01 - and you can't get everything done like
73:03 - what do you do how do you handle that
73:05 - um
73:06 - and i try to explain what happens like
73:09 - you know if i have a meeting and
73:10 - somebody wants something changed uh or i
73:13 - disagree with the change but we still
73:14 - have to do it you know things like that
73:16 - that you don't really get in any
73:18 - tutorials or online courses but you deal
73:21 - with
73:22 - you know in in the real world in jobs
73:25 - so we talk about stuff like that so i
73:27 - think that's really
73:29 - even if you don't necessarily understand
73:30 - the coding part of it
73:32 - you know things like that anybody can
73:34 - understand
73:44 - lone wolf asks where do i learn react or
73:46 - angular uh there's a lot of pl so the
73:48 - react documentation itself is really
73:51 - good uh udacity has a react course it's
73:54 - a paid course though i went i did the
73:56 - react nano degree through udacity and i
73:58 - i thought it was valuable uh but you
74:00 - don't have to spend money there's a lot
74:02 - of you know free react courses out there
74:05 - um i think
74:07 - i don't know i know some of you have
74:09 - used some react stuff so if you can
74:10 - think of any good react courses put in
74:12 - the live chat now please uh what else
74:14 - have i used
74:16 - i think codecademy has
74:18 - a react course
74:21 - so
74:21 - you know between some you know youtube
74:23 - videos and some of the documentation and
74:26 - the free courses out there you can
74:29 - you can get some good experience with
74:30 - react i am not as familiar with angular
74:33 - though so i can't help you you know
74:35 - quite as much there
74:37 - in terms of what
74:39 - where good resources are
74:47 - okay john says when you have no
74:48 - container for your markup you can use
74:50 - grid
74:51 - flex will work a bit but not easily all
74:53 - right you know what john i kind of wish
74:55 - i had seen that earlier but
74:57 - all right i'm i'm going to keep that in
74:58 - mind though and then maybe you know
75:00 - we'll try to use grid
75:02 - to um
75:04 - to display those and at least on desktop
75:07 - we can display them in in two columns
75:10 - instead of just one column
75:22 - um
75:23 - solely says
75:25 - uh which cms produced this markup uh
75:28 - it's an old uh dot-net framework based
75:32 - cms called ektron so it's e-k-t-r-o-n
75:38 - so i
75:39 - i almost never come across someone who
75:42 - even has heard of it i never heard of it
75:45 - until i got this job so
75:47 - uh it's
75:49 - i i think it's rare
76:03 - oh meyer says
76:05 - grid does require a parent component
76:07 - holding the children in his case he has
76:09 - none i believe
76:11 - yeah that's true we don't have any um
76:16 - john says it's easy enough to wrap the
76:17 - component in a grid div
76:20 - i
76:22 - yeah you know what maybe the solution is
76:24 - going to be that we may have to add some
76:26 - things
76:28 - with javascript off to see if that's
76:30 - going to be possible
76:40 - uh
76:41 - solely said the the current content is
76:43 - over 500 page in wordpress but it was
76:45 - brought over from an older cms that's
76:47 - correct and it's actually more than 500
76:49 - pages it's uh
76:52 - i haven't really counted but
76:56 - i mean potentially like if
76:59 - we're looking at over a
77:00 - thousand uh so it's it's quite a lot
77:04 - i'm trying to condense it
77:06 - as much as i can and clean up the data i
77:09 - think there's there's a lot that
77:11 - does not need to be split out into
77:13 - different you know pages or posts in
77:15 - wordpress and there's some stuff that we
77:17 - can just completely delete
77:19 - uh so we'll see what the count is once i
77:21 - get it all cleaned up but as of right
77:23 - now we're looking at over a thousand
77:26 - things i don't even have all the data
77:28 - uh transferred over yet
77:34 - uh meyer says i'm getting noise oh okay
77:37 - i'm i'm sorry i didn't see that earlier
77:39 - uh let me know if it's if anybody else
77:41 - was getting noise if you're still
77:43 - getting any noise
77:47 - um let's see if you have questions help
77:49 - me please what javascript framework for
77:51 - css animation is the best or vanilla js
77:54 - is the best way
77:56 - um green sock
77:58 - a lot of people use something called
78:00 - green sock for um for animation or for
78:03 - javascript animation
78:05 - um trying for css animation
78:10 - i'm not sure i mean if you want to mix
78:12 - javascript in as well go try out green
78:14 - suck i'm not sure about a css animation
78:17 - framework though
78:21 - uh lone wolf says any suggestions about
78:23 - how many hours i should dedicate to the
78:25 - free code camp front end course per day
78:28 - uh honestly i would if you can spend an
78:30 - hour a day at it i think that's good as
78:32 - long as you can be consistent
78:34 - uh
78:35 - i mean like it depends on what you're
78:37 - doing like right now if you have another
78:40 - job
78:41 - shoot for an hour a day if you can
78:43 - if you don't have another job and you
78:44 - can dedicate more time to it then you
78:47 - know try to dedicate more time but if
78:49 - you could do an hour a half hour every
78:52 - day that'll keep it in your mind every
78:54 - day and you'll be much more likely to uh
78:57 - to retain the information that that you
78:59 - learn
79:02 - uh flo vest says my raspberry pi arrives
79:05 - in two days any ideas what what i could
79:08 - do with it
79:09 - okay if anyone has any ideas about what
79:11 - to do with a raspberry pi put it in the
79:14 - in the chat please or if you're watching
79:16 - later on you can put it in the comments
79:20 - um
79:20 - yeah
79:22 - you can do one of those smart mirrors
79:24 - with the raspberry pi right
79:27 - i've always wanted to do one of those
79:29 - those look really cool
79:31 - but i guess there's
79:32 - there's so much stuff i
79:34 - that i've seen people do that really
79:36 - cool i guess it
79:38 - kind of depends on
79:40 - how much work you want to do how much
79:41 - money you want to put into it
79:54 - uh solely says which extension adds that
79:57 - tool tip for the h2 title
80:00 - i actually have no idea what extension
80:01 - that is i was surprised when it showed
80:04 - up that's the first time i had ever used
80:05 - it
80:06 - uh let's see
80:08 - let's see what it is
80:10 - let's see if we can see
80:16 - let's check my extensions
80:24 - maybe we might be able to tell just by
80:26 - the titles of the extensions
80:32 - okay
80:33 - uh
80:34 - css to react
80:43 - i'm guessing not
80:45 - only island
80:57 - hmm
81:00 - okay it's not really obvious just for my
81:03 - the names of my extensions what
81:06 - what does that so
81:08 - i'm not sure i don't really want to take
81:10 - the time to go through all of them but
81:12 - i'll leave this on the screen so at
81:14 - least you can see some of the extensions
81:15 - i'm using and try them out
81:27 - so i'm listening to spotify in the
81:28 - background and right now uh a song came
81:32 - on and it's ed sheeran doing a cover of
81:35 - uh britney spears um
81:38 - uh hit me baby one more time
81:42 - it was just so weird to hear that
81:45 - uh
81:46 - all right then
81:54 - um
81:57 - bargov says i'm a beginner i don't know
81:59 - anything but i have a craze about
82:01 - programming please help me to learn
82:03 - uh
82:04 - yeah i mean
82:07 - just stick around the streams and ask a
82:09 - lot of questions
82:11 - if you have any specific questions let
82:13 - me know
82:14 - i'm happy to help and there's a lot of
82:15 - other people here that are you know very
82:17 - helpful
82:20 - lone wolf asked if there's any
82:21 - implementation of jquery here no in this
82:23 - project we're not using any jquery
82:41 - uh
82:44 - bargov says how can i learn this
82:45 - programming
82:47 - um i mean we did a lot of css today so i
82:49 - mean just you do basic css tutorials um
82:53 - phoenix says start free code camp yet
82:55 - actually that's a great place to start
82:57 - go to freecodecamp.org
83:00 - and you know sign up and just do some of
83:02 - the exercises
83:04 - that will get you started you know
83:05 - you'll start out
83:07 - you know with some really basic stuff
83:08 - and work your way up in in difficulty
83:10 - and complexity
83:11 - and
83:13 - that'll give you a really good idea too
83:15 - of uh if this is for you if you know if
83:17 - you really like the work
83:33 - uh vlad
83:34 - asks if there will be training projects
83:36 - on angular
83:37 - i don't plan on doing anything with
83:39 - angular
83:40 - uh for my live streams but we did have
83:43 - um
83:44 - angular video recently
83:48 - on free code camp so if you check back
83:50 - you know through the last maybe
83:52 - just scroll back it's somewhere in the
83:54 - last like 10 videos or so that were
83:56 - released there was one about angular so
83:59 - check that
84:00 - out um
84:04 - i haven't watched it yet
84:07 - but
84:09 - you know that may be a good place to
84:10 - start
84:14 - uh
84:15 - sathvik says which what is good to learn
84:17 - flask i don't really know anything about
84:19 - flask so i wouldn't be able to help help
84:21 - you if anybody knows about flask uh
84:24 - please
84:25 - um
84:26 - let uh
84:27 - saatvik uh know uh here in the uh in the
84:31 - live chat or in the comments of the
84:32 - video
84:34 - uh let's see bargov says why don't you
84:37 - start your own company
84:38 - uh to be honest with you um
84:43 - for my um
84:45 - doing your own company involves a lot of
84:47 - work that's not coding work and i'm just
84:49 - not interested in that work
84:51 - so
84:52 - i don't know if if there was if i had a
84:53 - partner that was interested in all that
84:55 - work meaning like the work of uh doing
84:58 - taxes doing payroll collecting
85:01 - payments from clients
85:03 - uh marketing the company if there are
85:05 - people that were interested in that and
85:07 - i could just do the code i would be okay
85:09 - with that but i was freelance i had to
85:11 - do all that stuff before
85:14 - i just don't enjoy it i'd rather just
85:17 - spend my time doing coding
85:19 - and let somebody else worry about that
85:22 - so
85:24 - that's one of the reasons why i don't
85:25 - start my own company
85:30 - uh
85:31 - hammy says shout out from tunisia happy
85:34 - to be with you uh awesome
85:37 - awesome thank you
85:39 - i'm glad you're with us too
85:42 - john says i know this is a nudge to
85:43 - installing style components but you can
85:45 - then append all the incoming markup tags
85:48 - with styled
85:49 - uh ie cons style left title equals
85:54 - your css here
85:56 - okay
85:58 - i didn't realize we could do that off
86:00 - maybe we'll have to look into that more
86:05 - uh ash ashwini says need help and
86:08 - documentation
86:09 - uh ashwini i'm not sure if you're asking
86:11 - if i need help with documentation or if
86:14 - you're saying that you need help and
86:16 - documentation so
86:17 - um let me know which is which uh
86:20 - we always need help with everything so
86:22 - if you'd like to
86:25 - uh check out the repository for this
86:27 - project or some of the other projects
86:28 - that we've been knowing
86:30 - uh links in the description
86:32 - and uh submit a pull request working on
86:35 - some of the documentation that would be
86:36 - awesome
86:39 - uh it's definitely it's not expected or
86:41 - required of anyone but it's definitely
86:43 - appreciated
86:46 - uh
86:50 - scrub is says uh how did you set up
86:52 - react on salesforce actually i didn't do
86:55 - when we did stuff with salesforce we
86:57 - didn't set up react with salesforce that
86:59 - would be awesome but i never did it
87:03 - we just use like plain
87:05 - css and javascript
87:15 - uh hamami says isn't it better to use uh
87:18 - rem instead of pixels
87:21 - um yeah meyer says yes it's better uh
87:26 - yeah you know what
87:28 - that's something that keeps coming up as
87:29 - well
87:30 - i just use pixels because in my mind uh
87:34 - i ca i know what size in terms of pixels
87:37 - i need and what will work
87:39 - i
87:40 - i haven't used uh em or rem enough to be
87:43 - able to visualize that yet so that's why
87:45 - i just fall back on pixels
87:47 - so
87:48 - i would really have to make an effort to
87:50 - try to use um rem more
87:55 - uh when i could get to that point so
87:58 - especially for streams when i'm trying
88:00 - to talk and do this at the same time and
88:02 - try to do it quickly
88:04 - i just default back to pixels so
88:08 - um and that's just
88:09 - i started out with pixels and that's you
88:12 - know what i use 90 of the time at least
88:14 - so that's that's just kind of where my
88:16 - my mind is
88:23 - let's see
88:25 - oops it
88:26 - it scrolled me down to the bottom and i
88:28 - lost my place let me scroll back uh
88:31 - uh okay
88:32 - john says i guess i'm shocked that those
88:34 - tags are being accepted as html markup
88:36 - the w3 consortium validator would never
88:38 - pass that yeah
88:40 - i
88:41 - i don't worry about
88:43 - that the validator but i mean they're
88:45 - just
88:46 - it probably just reads it as you know
88:48 - custom elements
88:49 - uh which which are okay
89:03 - uh me says if you want uh jesse tell us
89:06 - about some keyboard shortcuts you use
89:08 - um
89:11 - generally what do i use
89:15 - i don't know what i use that's like
89:17 - beyond just the normal stuff um
89:21 - i mean in the terminal obviously you
89:23 - know you use your up and down arrow keys
89:25 - to go through past commands
89:27 - uh use tab for autocomplete a lot
89:30 - so both in the terminal and you know in
89:33 - my
89:34 - my editor
89:35 - other than that i'm not really
89:38 - it would probably help if i did learn
89:40 - more
89:41 - uh more hotkeys but you know right now i
89:45 - you know just use some really basic ones
89:50 - i wish i used more i wish i had a a
89:52 - cooler answer for that but i just used
89:54 - pro you know basic ones that most people
89:56 - know about
89:59 - uh raul says hi nice to see you back um
90:02 - remember me wish me luck sunday is my
90:04 - entrance
90:05 - my my last chance
90:07 - oh okay well good yeah definitely good
90:09 - luck with that
90:12 - and uh let us know if you can let us
90:15 - know how everything goes you know next
90:17 - next week
90:22 - okay so uh ro sharma says
90:26 - i was going through youtube and the
90:28 - title got me okay cool so the title
90:30 - uh so i guess a lot of people
90:34 - you know maybe maybe it was the title of
90:36 - basic css that you know people responded
90:39 - to
90:46 - uh eddie says are you still in school or
90:48 - are you working for a company
90:50 - um
90:51 - yeah so i'm i'm working for uh for a
90:54 - university so i'm a full-time front-end
90:56 - developer uh working for a company
91:00 - uh slowly says i'm i'm new but since i
91:02 - follow free code camp i got a
91:04 - notification from youtube that there
91:05 - will be a basic css styling live stream
91:08 - never done react though but i think i
91:09 - will go back and do it okay cool yeah
91:12 - yeah i didn't really want this to be
91:14 - like about react i wanted to try to
91:15 - stick to the css as much as possible but
91:18 - we ended up having to do a little react
91:19 - stuff at the end
91:21 - uh but you know hopefully it was there
91:23 - was enough css in there
91:26 - that it was maybe useful to some people
91:30 - uh
91:31 - chat play says i subscribe to this
91:33 - channel since i don't know react well i
91:36 - watch recorded episodes from project one
91:37 - okay cool
91:39 - cool
91:41 - uh how many just activated notifications
91:43 - on your channel i'm currently doing the
91:44 - free code camp algorithms flowvest the
91:47 - same
91:53 - cool
91:58 - there was a github link
92:00 - today
92:02 - uh darshan asked where the github link
92:04 - is for the code we developed today it
92:06 - should be in the description to this
92:07 - video so there should be a link to the
92:09 - github repo
92:12 - says is there a standard free code camp
92:14 - link or is the same as airbnb repo that
92:18 - yesterday you posted uh enzyme and just
92:20 - stuff on
92:24 - yeah it should be
92:26 - the link should be in the description so
92:28 - it'll be like uh fus dash marcom slash
92:32 - franciscan uh hyphen reacts
92:36 - uh that'll be the
92:38 - that'll be part of the link it'll be a
92:39 - github link and that'll be the end of it
92:54 - hard knock muscle says if you started
92:56 - your own company what would it be
92:58 - um
93:00 - i guess
93:02 - it would be cool to have a company like
93:03 - based around like a product like let's
93:06 - say
93:07 - i don't know i had a good idea and
93:09 - you could just dedicate time to that
93:13 - i mean i don't know what it would be but
93:15 - you know some sort of web-based
93:18 - you know service or something
93:20 - otherwise
93:21 - you know maybe some sort of agency
93:24 - uh that we did work for i just
93:29 - i don't know i don't know how i really
93:31 - feel about
93:32 - about an agency
93:35 - i've done some work with agencies before
93:37 - and i
93:38 - there there's good and bad to it right i
93:40 - mean it's kind of cool that you get to
93:41 - work on different things
93:45 - uh but
93:48 - yeah i don't know i mean you're always
93:50 - having to look for new clients and so
93:52 - there's not a lot of
93:54 - stability necessarily
93:56 - um
93:58 - yeah so
94:01 - i don't know i'm not really sure but
94:02 - something along those lines i guess
94:04 - would be
94:05 - you know what i'd want to do
94:13 - uh
94:14 - alicia asks are you doing css styling
94:18 - right now
94:19 - um no i mean right we're just kind of
94:21 - doing question and answer stuff right
94:23 - now so if you want to see the css part
94:24 - you can watch the recording so you can
94:26 - go back and watch the beginning and we
94:28 - did that like the
94:29 - the end here we're just doing question
94:31 - answers so if you have any questions uh
94:33 - please you know feel free to put them in
94:35 - the in the live chat
94:46 - uh nino says what would you consider
94:48 - yourself a web designer a web developer
94:51 - um
94:52 - i consider myself a developer that
94:55 - does design occasionally when when i
94:57 - need to
94:58 - so we don't really have where i work at
95:00 - we don't have a dedicated web designer
95:04 - so i do have to do some of that work but
95:07 - it's it's i think a small part of of
95:10 - what i do so i've
95:12 - with a lot of help from google's
95:13 - material design i've developed a style
95:16 - guide for university websites and then i
95:18 - basically follow that style guide so i
95:20 - don't have to come up with brand new
95:22 - designs every time i just i
95:25 - i use you know basic
95:28 - framework that is that i've developed
95:30 - and then you know design some elements
95:33 - as needed if something new comes up
95:49 - uh john says it's usually the people
95:51 - here on chat who let jesse know about
95:53 - the cool keyboard shortcuts yeah that's
95:55 - for sure you all give me so many uh
95:57 - really awesome uh tips about stuff like
96:00 - that
96:02 - i learned so much from you all
96:04 - um how many says is it possible to work
96:07 - as a developer for free like for
96:09 - donation uh like a donation
96:12 - yeah
96:13 - okay so i'm not
96:15 - i'm not 100 sure how you mean that like
96:18 - you could donate your services to
96:19 - someone else that's definitely possible
96:22 - um i i do that for
96:25 - uh some organizations around here like
96:27 - some non-profits
96:28 - um
96:30 - or are you saying like people would
96:32 - donate to you for your work that's also
96:35 - possible
96:36 - um so the um uh was it henry's henry zhu
96:41 - uh he's at leftpad on twitter um
96:46 - he recently uh quit his full-time job to
96:50 - volunteer to maintain the babble
96:53 - repository full-time and he right now
96:55 - he's living off of donations so the last
96:58 - time i heard i think it was up to like
97:00 - um
97:02 - on his patreon uh
97:04 - they've donated it's like three thousand
97:06 - dollars a month for him to work
97:09 - uh full time on um
97:13 - on this open source project on babel so
97:16 - i think that's really cool that that
97:18 - would actually be pretty awesome to do
97:32 - okay oh and darshan says
97:35 - volunteermatch.org has some coding
97:37 - positions
97:38 - okay cool i've never been to
97:39 - volunteermuch.org but that might be
97:41 - you know cool to check out
97:43 - all right wow i've finally gotten to the
97:45 - bottom of the chat today was uh we had a

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're gonna do some css uh so not sass or css and js or anything like that just regular css this should be a great stream for beginners because usually if you want to get into web development you start out with html and css so i hope that we have no technical issues with the stream i can see my mic is working today and so far i've not dropped any frames so this might be the first successful stream uh from my my home office which is actually just a corner of my laundry room in my basement right now but don't not going to do a lengthy introduction i think you know we'll just get started i do want to show off my my tshirt so this is the november tshirt from the conference at the 2017 november conference so i thought it was pretty cool they had cool stuff there i know uh you've seen i think i've worn other stuff before or put it on instagram or something there's a tshirt a hoodie a november hat uh i can get socks from that conference the socks were from heroku but anyway just wanted to show that off uh before we get started if you're new to the stream let me just give you a very quick rundown of how things go this stream is not exactly a tutorial uh instead this is my daytoday work as a frontend developer for a small university so whatever i need to work on that day i just pick whatever i think will be the most interesting thing and then i stream it for about an hour or so but i take breaks to answer questions and i try to narrate what i'm doing so that you know hopefully it's beneficial to you all that watch and then you can give me you know your your feedback and and your help and ideas as i go along so it ends up being very collaborative i time these with a pomodoro timer which means for 25 minutes i i mostly code and don't really look too much at the live chat then i take a little break and i answer questions to live chat then i go back and do another 25 minute session and then after that i go back and and the final part of the stream is just all question and answer and sometimes that takes a long time sometimes it doesn't it entirely depends on you and and your questions this is definitely beginner friendly feel free to ask any questions don't worry about you know if you think your question is is a silly question don't worry about it uh you know we're all trying to learn here and get better and we're always trying to be very helpful if somebody is being uh not very nice in the chat then i will talk to them about that i i've only had to ban somebody once uh so you know we've been doing these streams for almost a year now and so we have a pretty good track record of having you know kind of a positive uh experience here so having said that uh let's get started so i'm going to start my pomodoro clock and i'm going to start out by just showing you what's uh what we're going to work on so i want to go to the major.js page if you all want to follow along uh where you know at home you can go to the github repository that's linked in the description to this video and check out this major.js component that's in the pages folder that's where we're going to spend most of our time well i take that back we're probably going to create a css file and that's where we're going to spend most of our time so it's probably not a bad idea to see if we already have one style that would be under static styles no we don't so we we actually don't have a css file for this component so that's kind of nice we'll start from a blank one and now i'm going to let you see what we need to style it's it's a little bit tricky so we have a lot of freedom with what we're going to turn this into oops let me switch the scene so you all can see and oops there we go okay all right so this is what we currently have this is the the current site that we're redoing so there's this thing here where user can click and get you know potentially what their schedule could be if they decided to come to the university and uh take uh be a classics major right so i got some feedback from some current students and they said that they really liked this and this helped them a lot when they were deciding so i do want to make this nicer this is what it looks like currently so we brought over all the markup and none of the styles so it's just a list so our goal today is to take this list and turn it into something that basically does this it does not have to look like this at all we can completely change how this looks the but it just needs to in a reasonable way that would be nice for a user it needs to be able to display the classes that would be taken during you know during their different years and semesters and we have to work with the existing markup so potentially i could change the markup but there's a lot and we're running out of time before you know launch time so i'm thinking so this probably needs to be launched sometime in maybe this month let me think hold on a second let me when's the first day of summer is it june yeah it's june right so let's let's figure the launch date is going to be sometime in early june uh kind of at the latest so anyway i would like to just work with the markup as is at a later date we can go back and if we want to change markup and organize the data in a better way that's fine but otherwise i've just brought this over as is and that's what we're gonna work with all right michael says june 21st okay i thought it was june i just realized i haven't looked at all at the uh chat since we started so i am going to go back and read this i just want to scan quickly to make sure there's nothing wrong with my stream that you are telling me about okay all right looks like everything's good with the stream so first thing we're going to do is just check out what we have in devtools let's inspect it now i know on some streams i i have a tool running called ngrok that allows you to inspect things on your own computer i don't have ngrok running right now for two reasons one i don't even have it installed or set up on this computer but also i don't think this computer could handle running ngrok and doing a live stream at the same time i would like to test it out at some point it would have been good for this type of stream but uh now it's kind of too late to try it out anyway i didn't really think about it until we already started all right so i'm gonna make this a bit bigger let's see so right now what i'm just looking for is like what markup are we are we dealing with here what does this look like uh so let's see it looks like classics all right so we have an h2 at the top this is good oh and then okay so these are also h2s not really happy about that i mean this is obviously the header for the whole thing so i would have liked it if these were maybe h3s or something but that's what we have and then these are in left title tags so what we've noticed previously that when we're bringing over data from this older content management system called ektron we have a lot of custom elements so this is one of those a left title all right we have break tags we have left interesting we have tags that are just left tags and then wow even all the courses are h2s with a class of title and then a link we have a link tag that has nothing in it it looks like we have display none set on a link which i mean that that obviously makes sense right um okay so i'm assuming we're gonna have some right tags here so let's check it out okay right title and we have some right tags okay this is not this is not terrible let's see if you are okay and then this is a link and i already set up this route so this link actually works so that's what i was doing earlier today i was just going through cleaning up data setting up routes which is what i've been doing pretty much every day the last couple weeks there's a lot to go through all right and then each one of these is in a tab okay uh i think this markup is something we can work with this doesn't look it doesn't look it could have been a lot worse right based on what we were seeing before it could have been worse so i think this will work we should be able to do what we need to do so right off the bat i'm going to tell you what i'm thinking about doing and then you all can give me your feedback and and see if um if you have any you know any input maybe i'm missing something so i mean obviously i'm i'm going to use these left tags and left title for that's where i'm going to attach the positioning to so in our cr css we're going to target these and position them to the left or to the right since there's no like containers i'm thinking this is going to be tough yeah there's no containers around all this which is going to make it a little bit tough maybe we'll just do like oldfashioned floats and see if that works for our right and our left i mean normally i would go with something else but that's going to be maybe my first try and then it looks like these br tags are just way too much space so we may end up just setting these to like display none or something like that let's take it out okay yeah if we set display none on those that's that's a lot nicer alright so just like that that automatically looks more reasonable we're also going to have to change some of the styles on like these titles for semesters and years so right now there's no visual hierarchy in terms of font size font weight color or indentation so all that's going to have to change and then the the link styling will change this is just default link styling uh so we'll we'll switch that up but other than that it's not it's not really terrible uh yeah i don't think that's too bad we'll get that all figured out and then we'll see what it looks like with just having first year first semester and then side by side and then doing the same thing here and then we'll see like do we want to go back to some sort of tabbed version is it okay to just have them all right there i'm not really sure i want to see it first all right so let me look at the live chat since i've been asking a few questions here and see see what you all think all right i see i see a lot of questions in the chat right now so i will get to the questions so um in about about 15 minutes i'll get to the questions so please be patient let's see uh how many says so we'll not modify the html at all if potentially we can modify the html but if we do it it's going to be using javascript in the react component because i have a lot of pages that have markup just like this so i don't want to have to manually go in and and modify it oh and it har should just explain that so sorry i didn't see that okay well it looks like we're good to start in on this so first thing i want to do is is try to get this positioning uh working so let's go you know what let's just try to do a little bit right here in dev tools if you're very new uh to using you know dev tools you know if you just right click on anything in the page and then go down to inspect dev tools will come up if you've never used it before it'll come up and it'll be white instead of a black background you can just go into the settings up here and you can change that to a dark background if you want right so all the changes we're going to do here are just going to be temporary they're only working our browser so you don't have to worry about actually changing or messing up the code and you could do this for any website that you go on uh to just kind of mess with it and see how it works so we're going to take our left tags and let's see actually let me go with the right ones first let's see no i don't with the left so let's try a float left see how weird it looks all right so what did we just we just took all nope that's not gonna work you know what i didn't even think about that okay uh so let's leave that alone for now let's take our right ones let's see what we can do oh harsha says there's 101 people watching which is more i well i haven't even looked at the analytics at all wow so we're we're at 85 right now based on my analytics but that's still a lot of people so um forever new people uh welcome thanks for thanks for watching feel free to put any questions you have in the chat and uh i'll answer them after a little while all right so let's go with our our right tags and let's see what we can do so let's see what we can do hmm so i'm obviously the float's not gonna work right so if we do float right right we're gonna get some weirdness again uh so float is out for what we're doing right now but we could maybe do let's mess with the position oops and that did not position uh absolute no this is not this is gonna be trickier than i thought so the lack of a container is really messing this up all right one thing we can do is see what they used here in the old site assuming that they have the uh the same elements on the page all right oh so this ended up getting interpreted as ul uh unordered list wow okay so it looks like the old content management system took those those custom tags and converted them to normal html tags and ended up wrapping these so think of think of these as like components in react so no actually that doesn't make any sense either i'm not exactly sure how that that worked out because you know there's really not any type of container interesting okay let's start with something easier while we think about how we can do uh how we can do this let's just get uh the headings fixed in terms of uh the size font weight and color i have some ideas for how to handle the positioning but it's going to involve some javascript so i'd rather stick to css for now since that's what i i made the title of this video so i imagine there's a lot of people here for the css so let's do some css then and where are we at sample programs this h2 is let's check we don't want it to be too much larger than this so let's look up what we have on this h1 okay so we don't have anything special it's just default so probably not not really a bad idea to just keep it as is for now since it's it's the appropriate size and weight in relation to this but these h2s that's why i have an extra title here it's really interesting okay um wow these do not stand out at all all right we're gonna do some weird css here for a second so i'm going to write this let's set up our css our file so we have our styles right now in fact we use are we pulling in any styles okay we're actually pulling in the styles from news.css so you may want to pull those styles over let's make a new file first and we'll call this major.css to match our component of major.css let's check out our news.css and you know what let me make some more space here let's move this over because we're not really using it right now and we'll move our our terminal stuff down and then i'm gonna make this a bit bigger so it'll be easier for you all to see okay hopefully that is uh easier to see so what i'm gonna do is take everything that's currently in news dot css and i'm going to move it over to major dot css because i'm not sure what in this file is really making a difference in our our major uh js component so i'm going to save that let's go over to our component of major dot js sorry that for the lag it's just you're trying to run the live stream and everything else makes it a little slow so we're right now we're bringing in if you don't know what's going on in this particular component don't worry about it if you're not familiar with react you know it's it's totally cool if you don't understand but we're basically just importing styles all right with a link tag so that should be you know familiar to you from just you know writing normal html so we're going to pull in this major dot css file so now anything that we change here will be reflected ah let's see so let's go through this just a bit i'm gonna say okay so right now anything that is displaying is uh root gets display none and we did have something that was roots or was it i thought we had something yeah so it's root tabbed all right um we have probably some of these will be we won't necessarily uh need to keep them but we'll sort that out later on right now let's add some more styles to the bottom so what i want to target are h2s with the class of title so h2s dot title and then i want to say not um what do you want to do this is it first first of type i might have to look up the syntax so what i want to select is all the h2s that have the class of title except not oh you know what i was mistaken this h2 is just stacked so this one doesn't have the class of title so we're gonna we're good then okay that makes this a lot easier so normally i'm not i don't like manipulating h2s uh we still want this title so for in css what we're doing is selecting an h2 and then we do dot title this right after that that means any h2s with the class of title if i had a space here this would mean any element with the class of title that exists inside of an h2 so you could see the little tooltip is displaying what it would be but now if we backspace it you can see we're looking for h2s with the class of title and only h2s okay so i know for most of you that's probably you know you're probably familiar with that but i i do want to try to explain as much as i can you know for anybody that's just just curious about web development uh just starting out so right now we're we're targeting these year titles so this first year you know second second year um so we want to make this so let's just test it out here font size 18 pixels okay so we're going to go up from there and let's see let's say 24 pixels i really don't want to go any more than 24 pixels on this one and we could do font weight and let's see 500 okay 500 looks good that definitely makes it thinner and then can we do color let's make our color be rgba and we're going to use 0 0 0 um 0.87 oops i need commas don't i zero zero okay so i wasn't sure if that was the color or not but that's what color i want okay so let's go with that for now and also we need to remember to make those those br tags work so major route 239 br all right so we're definitely gonna have to override this style where is it getting that from that's weird okay so we're copy and pasting that in here and let's just want to fix the indentation on that and then uh let's go with vr display i hate to use important but let's just do it just for time i don't really want to go through this and try to figure out what exactly is going on with this so just to see what it looks like we're gonna go with uh important in there so um let's do a refresh make sure it's working all right cool so now we have we have that and my timer went off so let me take a short break and answer as many questions as i can there's a lot of questions here so if i don't get to yours this time i'll get to it after the second pomodoro session i'll spend the the entire end of the stream just answering questions let's see so i'm not going to read out all the comments just because there's so much in here uh do want to get uh to the questions though although i'll probably read out comments that are either maybe funny or flattering to me personally so for instance klaus says i look way better with the stubble instead of the beard thanks my wife agrees world's asked if i'm in the basement i am i am coding from a corner of my basement uh nilish asks when i'll continue the react testing video uh maybe later this week i was doing i was reading a lot of documentation on testing and i still could not figure out what i have to do uh for the the click i i i don't i'll i have to talk about this for like 20 minutes or not at all so i will do another stream about it when i figure it out uh remy asks how many monitors i have uh right now i have a macbook pro so there's a screen with that and then two external monitors hooked up and that's my setup at my offices as well except it's an imac and then two external monitors the most i've ever used is four monitors that was a really cool setup i'd like to go back to that eventually and it says i look younger without the beard yeah i definitely everybody keeps saying that that i look younger and you probably can't see it on the live stream but i have gray hair in my beard so i definitely look younger because i don't i don't yet have any gray hair like on the top of my head so uh yeah definitely younger solely says shout out from south africa thanks for watching uh thanks for the shout out john says uh it is usually a good idea to draw out a plan what divs hold what headings and some sense of functional ui ux yeah for sure uh normally i'm like right now we're kind of stuck with this markup so normally i wouldn't start like this but many of you if you're actually going to work will probably find yourself in a situation where you don't have control over the markup but you need to style it as best you can and what we're doing now is kind of a good example of how you handle that uh how memory says pure css no bootstrap yep no no bootstrap or nothing yeah we so on the components themselves we have styles from material ui but what we're when we're doing this in terms of like styling the markup that's been imported from the other cms it's it's pretty much all from scratch uh how many asked what material ui is uh it's a um a ui framework for react that uses uh material design principles the lone wolf says can anyone explain what br and link does the br tags are html tags that are supposed to include a line break and potentially like some space in between lines but really it's better to use css for that like margins padding and things like that so uh i very rarely use a break tag uh you know now it correct me if i'm wrong but those were kind of really an older thing that you just you don't really do that much anymore and then the link tag i don't know what they're doing with the link tag in here in terms of what got imported from the old cms but link tags are supposed to be to pull in css files uh saatvik says what does the left tag do it really doesn't do anything right now until we assign it some sort of styles it was a custom tag that did have some meaning in the old content management system but doesn't currently in a new system uh javier says is this a semantic html horrible on purpose i don't know what the designers of that old cms were thinking if they wanted it to be like that on purpose or not uh i don't think i'll ever get a chance to ask him so we may never know all right so my timer went off i'm going to go back and start another pomodoro session and then i'm going to come back to the chat and keep going from where i left off which is i don't think i have a pen or anything here all right so the timestamp for me for where i left off is 2 45 p.m in the chat so let's try to remember 2 45 p.m i bet i can just write it here yeah let's just all right so in my terminal i write 245 to remember that that's there and then i'll remember where to go okay so we've got our h2s with the class of title style and we've gotten rid of those those break tags well i i shouldn't say we got rid of them they're still there we're just not displaying them okay so now here's what we have we definitely need to style these and these right we if we're going with a hierarchy here uh it's not it's not looking good so far so our left title and right title are going to get the same styles in terms of font and color so let's test out what we think will look good uh so we'll go with a font size of let's say 20 all right 20 pixels a little bit bigger and do we want a different font weight let's see what we want so the last one was what 500 let's try a 400 font weight which is going to be pretty light okay not bad and then let's take that color we want that same color of r g r g b a so this rgba that i'm putting in here if we just did the zero zero zero that would give us pure black but instead we're doing this 0.87 all right and that that last one is like the the opacity so what we're doing is essentially making a grayish color but we're not putting a gray hex value in text is actually more readable if you do solid black and you make it a little bit transparent to get your gray if you do a gray hex value it's less readable so i'm not going to do it right now like to demonstrate but you know try it out on your own and try them side by side you'll be amazed at the difference okay so that's not bad it still looks weird because we haven't styled these yet but you know i think we're on the right track so let's copy this and we'll go over to our our file here and let's do left what was that left title yeah left title and we're gonna do um right title so since we put this comma in here it's going to add the same styles for both of these so let's save that just to make sure that styles are applying across the board there we are okay so we have the same styles all the way down good now let's see what we're working with for for these each one of these all right oh goodness um all right this is not too bad so we want to target all h2s that have a class of title that live within a left tag or a right tag so uh we can we can definitely do that so let's let's do this over here it's going to be a little tricky to do it in dev tools not not impossible but let's just do it over here so let's do a left tag and let's say h2 title and then let's do a write tag and then we'll say h2 title so this will target what we wanted to target we could hover over that so any h2s with a class of title that are within a left tag or a right tag and that's what we're going to go with here and let's based on what we've seen with the other things we styled we can pretty much guess without even looking what's going to work so let's do a font size of 18 pixels and we'll do a font weight and we're going to keep it at that 400 pixels if you start to go below below 400 it gets a little bit difficult to read if you have a nice screen it's okay and it actually looks really good but for users that have older screens it's it's very hard to to read so although aesthetically i really like how it looks i mean from just out of respect for a lot of the users that may not have you know high definition screens i'm not i'm going to very rarely go below 400 unless we're talking about large font sizes and so finally uh we're going to make the color let's just copy and paste so we don't have to type that out again but i want to try it with a lighter gray color because we need i think we need some differentiation here because we have a lot of levels going on so let's try 54. usually the values i end up using are either 87 or 54. never pure black um and this will give us a lighter gray color that'll still be readable so let me refresh i do have like auto auto refresh set up here but since the uh there's a bit of lag here it's kind of running a little slow from the live stream i just keep doing this you know manually okay so let me zoom in here it's easy to see so right now we do have this font weight looks a little big left h2 title that's interesting why is this did i mess it up oops i put pixels in the font weight uh i'm sure some of you already caught that and put it in the uh in the live chat so sorry if i didn't glance over there but yeah that's can't put pixels in the font weight it's just a regular you know number okay that that looks nicer so this what we have right now uh not too bad well we forgot to style this i'm not that worried about styling that so i'm going to leave that alone for now and let's see so we'll come to the page i just kind of wanted like zoom out and just see the the big picture here so we come to the page we see the mission aims okay and now we go down sample program classics first year first semester second semesters okay it's it's a bit much it is a bit much you know what i wonder let's shrink this down and see what it would look like on a small screen like on a phone uh let's see it's not too bad i think there needs to be uh some some work with the padding and the margins here so we need you know better spacing so it doesn't all run together and i think we don't need links for each one of these so for this oh so for this one it has it here because this whole thing changes when you click it so that's why it keeps repeating that link so we don't need to do that i do want to see what what happens when this goes small okay interesting all right so it it it doesn't display them all but it still has this kind of uh stacked look within each one okay all right not it's not terrible i don't think we're gonna get into doing anything like this right now but i'm gonna keep that open as kind of a possibility here okay all right so let's go back to what we have here and all right let's see where this oops where this is let's inspect that and okay view all so this is within a view all tag and classics classes text that's really weird i don't want it to say that um i don't know why it says that okay so let's take these view all tags and which one are we going to i wonder if we could all right let me let me just get over what i'm kind of thinking now uh so i'm thinking we definitely don't need the same link four times on the page we really just need it one time oh excuse me we need to link one time and my thought was okay well let me hide all of them except for one but i also had a thought that you know the the url for this is going to be pretty predictable it's just going to be classics and classes so potentially we could just put into our indoor component another element there in our component to display it and it can just add in are our slug right for that particular uh page into here and just build the url like that the benefit of doing it that way is that we can use link prefetching so right now this is built in so if i click this we're going to get a page refresh so let's let's see see we get a page refresh which obviously takes longer so we don't really want that yeah so let's do it let's do it like that so first things first let's take view all and we're going to say let's just put it right here with this br all right so view all is gonna be display none and then we'll just put in and that's also gonna solve the problem of the uh the text here being weird like classics classes text doesn't really say to the user what's going to be on that page so i guess i'll have to refresh my auto refresh is just not happening all right there we go so we've gotten rid of that and just to add this in i guess we could add this in quickly let me see how much time i have 10 minutes okay that's enough time we can go back to our major.js and we could see what we're going to get is the id our id i believe is what we're going to want and that would be classics right all right so let's go down here our query is bringing in all this data so after that yeah we can put our other element after that so let's just add a link tag and make sure we've imported our link tag and we have not maybe we can just copy and paste it from an existing component so i know we have the drawer item.js is doing this so we're gonna import link from next link so this part here is getting a little bit more advanced uh we're using react so if you're not familiar with this uh don't worry about it this is definitely not css stuff but i'm just gonna copy and paste a few things just to save time and then we're gonna get back to our css so let's get our link okay and link there we go so all right this will get auto formatted i know it looks weird now but we don't need a key for this oops and we can put no we're going to put that in manually yeah let's do um so this is going to be uh template literal so template literal is when you want to put in a string but you want to also have some javascript in there as well it makes it a lot easier than having to do a normal string and then concatenate uh that together with plus signs with some some javascript so what we want to do is just put um oops let's do this first part is going to be our our id so this props id actually did we deconstruct yeah this props id okay uh so we have this props id and i forgot i forgot this so when we want to use javascript we put a dollar sign and some curly brackets and then after the next curly bracket we drop right back into stringland and we can just put the string which is which is classes all right so that's what works here uh and let's see let's look over here i'm glad we have this open uh so we did have some weirdness going on where uh we needed we needed to add some things and as page type academics and pages let's let's pull this in just to see okay so are we pulling this in pulling this in his page is it really paige are we doing this as i think we're doing these classes as a major type nope it's no major id classes uh id is gonna be this props id oops and then hyphen let's change this to template literal syntax oops i'm gonna explain what i'm doing here in just a second and hope that it works uh it's just gonna be course descriptions all right let's save that okay so assuming this is gonna work which i'm assuming here is that uh we're adding in uh the url that'll be seen in the in the browser but we're also adding in this as and this is going to send some data to our um to our router and enable this link to act as clientside routing so that's why we're we're kind of doing this uh if you want to know why we do it like this check out show me what issue or pull request you know what if anybody's interested in the why let me know in the live chat and i will take the time to look up where the you can get more info about this in the repository uh otherwise if nobody's really interested then i'm not going to look it up right now but let's let's see if this even works there we go course descriptions yeah not working i did the wrong thing maybe i should check the server to see if i'm using uh the correct correct words here so majors all right this could be a problem majors all right let's see if that makes a difference uh you know what i flipped them around that's what i was worried about okay so the as url needs to go is the href all right let's switch it i messed it up makes a lot more sense now all right so this needs to be as and this needs to be ahref all right okay now let me refresh make sure this actually went through so it shouldn't so what was happening is it was showing us all those parameters when we hovered over and that's not what it should show us it just shows something that looks like a normal url all right so this now is looking like a normal url and so i'm going to click this and see what happens yeah there we go all right so i don't know if you caught that but what happened was uh hopefully if you saw the last time we tried to load this page it took a while now it was very fast because we never refreshed the page it routed clientside so that's what we wanted to happen let's go back and click it one more time just to see very fast so it's using clientside routing it's using prefetching caching so this is going to make the speed just that much faster and because we did it like this where we we put in variables instead of hardcoding this this will now work for every major page so they'll all have this here uh now part of the problem let me see this is the we're gonna have this now at the bottom of here so we'll have to think about what we want to do with that you know maybe we don't have uh these type of things appear on a major page so we'll have to work that out but for now i it looks a lot better so this this is just such a huge improvement over what was there when we started remember we had these huge font sizes and font weights and the spacing was really weird so this is not perfect and it's not really how i want it to be ideally but let's say we ran out of time and didn't get to do anything else with this this is still readable it makes some kind of sense visually so that's i'm okay with that for you know for what it is for right now all right awesome so my timer went off and now for the rest of the stream i'm gonna do questions uh although i probably should commit this so that you all can see all the code i gotta remember 245 is where i left off so let's do a git status if you're not familiar with git this will be like a really really tiny uh basic tutorial so when we use git status is the command in our terminal it shows us that we've modified the major.js file and then we've added a major.css file that's exactly what we worked on so that's that's what i expected to see so that's good let's we need to add these files to the staging area now so we're going to do a git add and i want to add all the files so i'm just going to put a period there hit enter now if we do a git status you can see these are green now they're in the this they're staged right so they're ready to be committed and i'm gonna use this command called yarn cm this does not come with git by default this was in addition just to help us make uh nice commit messages so let's say uh we're gonna add a new feature and uh we're just gonna write a very short statement explaining what we did and we'll just say add styles for uh course for sample sample schedules sample class schedules so you want it to be short but descriptive enough that you'll be able or someone else will be able to go back and read it and say okay i know what that's about so think like one sentence sample class schedules great there we are and are there breaking changes no does it affect any open issues i believe it does let me see i don't think i have that open i do yes let's check out the issues here style sample program sections so that's issue 102. so let's uh say that yes it does affect an open issue and let's say it affects issue uh number 102. now it's going to run some tests and i actually uh i changed one thing in the repository and for those of you who are contributing this should help you out a long time ago just kind of for demonstration purposes i had set the endtoend testing to not use the headless version of chrome browser so it actually popped up with a browser and you could see it going through the pages and then that was taking longer than it needed to so i went back and i set that to actually use the headless version and it cut the times about in half so if you had a slower computer your end end test might be timing out as they time out after 30 seconds i think so it should be better now if you download the latest changes uh i just committed them right before the stream started so hopefully that will help with with the time so sorry about that i just i didn't realize that i never switched it back which i should have because i could see it happening every time all right so let me go back while that's doing its thing i'm going to scroll back up to is that the timestamp 245 and i'm going to answer as many questions as i can here i should be what time is it i should be able to get to all the questions let's see uh hermene says so we'll not modify the html at all uh no not if we can help it uh i'm not opposed to using javascript though to modify it uh so just like we did when we added in that that extra link tag if we do it in a way that could be used across the board on all components i'm okay with that alright so everything passed and now we can do a get push origin and that'll push all our changes right up to our master branch so if you want to check out what we've done you can see it now in our github repo everything is up to date all right so i am skipping over some of the questions because they were answered right away uh by other people in the chat so uh thank you uh for for answering so many questions you are being really helpful when and answering each other's questions well it is you know we did have a lot more people than normal today i don't know what it was uh for anybody who may be here that's not normally here uh could you let me know uh how did you hear about the stream and and what made you decide to watch it today i'm just i have no idea what's different today i mean i haven't checked any messages maybe i got retweeted by somebody with a lot of followers it doesn't even look like that though all right yeah so i'm not really sure uh yeah okay so him emmy is one of the new ones cool thanks for watching so i just heard one of my kids in the background all right he's talking to uh to my wife all right i missed it har [ __ ] had said uh he was gonna go to sleep so uh if you watch the end of this harsha thank you so much for all your help here and in the live chat answering questions and uh thank you for staying up so late in harsh it's time zone it's it's well after midnight um so what is it might be like yeah it's really late it's like the middle of the night i need to get some better lighting see my it's really dark in here all right uh lone wolf says i'm just done through css html bootstrap and the front end course is that enough for me to comprehend all of this um you could probably comprehend all the like the css stuff if you're not familiar with react it may be a little bit more difficult to get what's going on there but i try to do uh his best the best job that i can with explaining things along the way and you can ask you know feel free to ask questions so i'd say give it a shot uh if you find that it's really difficult to follow along then you know hey maybe maybe this stream at this point is not for you but i i do try to do a mix of things that are you know different types of things uh different levels so you know some of them might be good you know for you where you're at right now some of them you know maybe not oh yeah you know what phoenix has a good point um the uh the main benefit i could see to this stream is seeing what it's like for a frontend developer to actually work through issues on a project have things break uh problems come up and you know try to try to just work through it and fix it also the ability to ask questions with so many you know really knowledgeable developers here in the live chat is is good as well um so in the sense of this being like a tutorial for let's say react or anything it's not really that uh but it it can give some i i mean i think it gets some good experiences to you know what do you do when things don't work uh when you have deadlines you know what and you can't get everything done like what do you do how do you handle that um and i try to explain what happens like you know if i have a meeting and somebody wants something changed uh or i disagree with the change but we still have to do it you know things like that that you don't really get in any tutorials or online courses but you deal with you know in in the real world in jobs so we talk about stuff like that so i think that's really even if you don't necessarily understand the coding part of it you know things like that anybody can understand lone wolf asks where do i learn react or angular uh there's a lot of pl so the react documentation itself is really good uh udacity has a react course it's a paid course though i went i did the react nano degree through udacity and i i thought it was valuable uh but you don't have to spend money there's a lot of you know free react courses out there um i think i don't know i know some of you have used some react stuff so if you can think of any good react courses put in the live chat now please uh what else have i used i think codecademy has a react course so you know between some you know youtube videos and some of the documentation and the free courses out there you can you can get some good experience with react i am not as familiar with angular though so i can't help you you know quite as much there in terms of what where good resources are okay john says when you have no container for your markup you can use grid flex will work a bit but not easily all right you know what john i kind of wish i had seen that earlier but all right i'm i'm going to keep that in mind though and then maybe you know we'll try to use grid to um to display those and at least on desktop we can display them in in two columns instead of just one column um solely says uh which cms produced this markup uh it's an old uh dotnet framework based cms called ektron so it's ektron so i i almost never come across someone who even has heard of it i never heard of it until i got this job so uh it's i i think it's rare oh meyer says grid does require a parent component holding the children in his case he has none i believe yeah that's true we don't have any um john says it's easy enough to wrap the component in a grid div i yeah you know what maybe the solution is going to be that we may have to add some things with javascript off to see if that's going to be possible uh solely said the the current content is over 500 page in wordpress but it was brought over from an older cms that's correct and it's actually more than 500 pages it's uh i haven't really counted but i mean potentially like if we're looking at over a thousand uh so it's it's quite a lot i'm trying to condense it as much as i can and clean up the data i think there's there's a lot that does not need to be split out into different you know pages or posts in wordpress and there's some stuff that we can just completely delete uh so we'll see what the count is once i get it all cleaned up but as of right now we're looking at over a thousand things i don't even have all the data uh transferred over yet uh meyer says i'm getting noise oh okay i'm i'm sorry i didn't see that earlier uh let me know if it's if anybody else was getting noise if you're still getting any noise um let's see if you have questions help me please what javascript framework for css animation is the best or vanilla js is the best way um green sock a lot of people use something called green sock for um for animation or for javascript animation um trying for css animation i'm not sure i mean if you want to mix javascript in as well go try out green suck i'm not sure about a css animation framework though uh lone wolf says any suggestions about how many hours i should dedicate to the free code camp front end course per day uh honestly i would if you can spend an hour a day at it i think that's good as long as you can be consistent uh i mean like it depends on what you're doing like right now if you have another job shoot for an hour a day if you can if you don't have another job and you can dedicate more time to it then you know try to dedicate more time but if you could do an hour a half hour every day that'll keep it in your mind every day and you'll be much more likely to uh to retain the information that that you learn uh flo vest says my raspberry pi arrives in two days any ideas what what i could do with it okay if anyone has any ideas about what to do with a raspberry pi put it in the in the chat please or if you're watching later on you can put it in the comments um yeah you can do one of those smart mirrors with the raspberry pi right i've always wanted to do one of those those look really cool but i guess there's there's so much stuff i that i've seen people do that really cool i guess it kind of depends on how much work you want to do how much money you want to put into it uh solely says which extension adds that tool tip for the h2 title i actually have no idea what extension that is i was surprised when it showed up that's the first time i had ever used it uh let's see let's see what it is let's see if we can see let's check my extensions maybe we might be able to tell just by the titles of the extensions okay uh css to react i'm guessing not only island hmm okay it's not really obvious just for my the names of my extensions what what does that so i'm not sure i don't really want to take the time to go through all of them but i'll leave this on the screen so at least you can see some of the extensions i'm using and try them out so i'm listening to spotify in the background and right now uh a song came on and it's ed sheeran doing a cover of uh britney spears um uh hit me baby one more time it was just so weird to hear that uh all right then um bargov says i'm a beginner i don't know anything but i have a craze about programming please help me to learn uh yeah i mean just stick around the streams and ask a lot of questions if you have any specific questions let me know i'm happy to help and there's a lot of other people here that are you know very helpful lone wolf asked if there's any implementation of jquery here no in this project we're not using any jquery uh bargov says how can i learn this programming um i mean we did a lot of css today so i mean just you do basic css tutorials um phoenix says start free code camp yet actually that's a great place to start go to freecodecamp.org and you know sign up and just do some of the exercises that will get you started you know you'll start out you know with some really basic stuff and work your way up in in difficulty and complexity and that'll give you a really good idea too of uh if this is for you if you know if you really like the work uh vlad asks if there will be training projects on angular i don't plan on doing anything with angular uh for my live streams but we did have um angular video recently on free code camp so if you check back you know through the last maybe just scroll back it's somewhere in the last like 10 videos or so that were released there was one about angular so check that out um i haven't watched it yet but you know that may be a good place to start uh sathvik says which what is good to learn flask i don't really know anything about flask so i wouldn't be able to help help you if anybody knows about flask uh please um let uh saatvik uh know uh here in the uh in the live chat or in the comments of the video uh let's see bargov says why don't you start your own company uh to be honest with you um for my um doing your own company involves a lot of work that's not coding work and i'm just not interested in that work so i don't know if if there was if i had a partner that was interested in all that work meaning like the work of uh doing taxes doing payroll collecting payments from clients uh marketing the company if there are people that were interested in that and i could just do the code i would be okay with that but i was freelance i had to do all that stuff before i just don't enjoy it i'd rather just spend my time doing coding and let somebody else worry about that so that's one of the reasons why i don't start my own company uh hammy says shout out from tunisia happy to be with you uh awesome awesome thank you i'm glad you're with us too john says i know this is a nudge to installing style components but you can then append all the incoming markup tags with styled uh ie cons style left title equals your css here okay i didn't realize we could do that off maybe we'll have to look into that more uh ash ashwini says need help and documentation uh ashwini i'm not sure if you're asking if i need help with documentation or if you're saying that you need help and documentation so um let me know which is which uh we always need help with everything so if you'd like to uh check out the repository for this project or some of the other projects that we've been knowing uh links in the description and uh submit a pull request working on some of the documentation that would be awesome uh it's definitely it's not expected or required of anyone but it's definitely appreciated uh scrub is says uh how did you set up react on salesforce actually i didn't do when we did stuff with salesforce we didn't set up react with salesforce that would be awesome but i never did it we just use like plain css and javascript uh hamami says isn't it better to use uh rem instead of pixels um yeah meyer says yes it's better uh yeah you know what that's something that keeps coming up as well i just use pixels because in my mind uh i ca i know what size in terms of pixels i need and what will work i i haven't used uh em or rem enough to be able to visualize that yet so that's why i just fall back on pixels so i would really have to make an effort to try to use um rem more uh when i could get to that point so especially for streams when i'm trying to talk and do this at the same time and try to do it quickly i just default back to pixels so um and that's just i started out with pixels and that's you know what i use 90 of the time at least so that's that's just kind of where my my mind is let's see oops it it scrolled me down to the bottom and i lost my place let me scroll back uh uh okay john says i guess i'm shocked that those tags are being accepted as html markup the w3 consortium validator would never pass that yeah i i don't worry about that the validator but i mean they're just it probably just reads it as you know custom elements uh which which are okay uh me says if you want uh jesse tell us about some keyboard shortcuts you use um generally what do i use i don't know what i use that's like beyond just the normal stuff um i mean in the terminal obviously you know you use your up and down arrow keys to go through past commands uh use tab for autocomplete a lot so both in the terminal and you know in my my editor other than that i'm not really it would probably help if i did learn more uh more hotkeys but you know right now i you know just use some really basic ones i wish i used more i wish i had a a cooler answer for that but i just used pro you know basic ones that most people know about uh raul says hi nice to see you back um remember me wish me luck sunday is my entrance my my last chance oh okay well good yeah definitely good luck with that and uh let us know if you can let us know how everything goes you know next next week okay so uh ro sharma says i was going through youtube and the title got me okay cool so the title uh so i guess a lot of people you know maybe maybe it was the title of basic css that you know people responded to uh eddie says are you still in school or are you working for a company um yeah so i'm i'm working for uh for a university so i'm a fulltime frontend developer uh working for a company uh slowly says i'm i'm new but since i follow free code camp i got a notification from youtube that there will be a basic css styling live stream never done react though but i think i will go back and do it okay cool yeah yeah i didn't really want this to be like about react i wanted to try to stick to the css as much as possible but we ended up having to do a little react stuff at the end uh but you know hopefully it was there was enough css in there that it was maybe useful to some people uh chat play says i subscribe to this channel since i don't know react well i watch recorded episodes from project one okay cool cool uh how many just activated notifications on your channel i'm currently doing the free code camp algorithms flowvest the same cool there was a github link today uh darshan asked where the github link is for the code we developed today it should be in the description to this video so there should be a link to the github repo says is there a standard free code camp link or is the same as airbnb repo that yesterday you posted uh enzyme and just stuff on yeah it should be the link should be in the description so it'll be like uh fus dash marcom slash franciscan uh hyphen reacts uh that'll be the that'll be part of the link it'll be a github link and that'll be the end of it hard knock muscle says if you started your own company what would it be um i guess it would be cool to have a company like based around like a product like let's say i don't know i had a good idea and you could just dedicate time to that i mean i don't know what it would be but you know some sort of webbased you know service or something otherwise you know maybe some sort of agency uh that we did work for i just i don't know i don't know how i really feel about about an agency i've done some work with agencies before and i there there's good and bad to it right i mean it's kind of cool that you get to work on different things uh but yeah i don't know i mean you're always having to look for new clients and so there's not a lot of stability necessarily um yeah so i don't know i'm not really sure but something along those lines i guess would be you know what i'd want to do uh alicia asks are you doing css styling right now um no i mean right we're just kind of doing question and answer stuff right now so if you want to see the css part you can watch the recording so you can go back and watch the beginning and we did that like the the end here we're just doing question answers so if you have any questions uh please you know feel free to put them in the in the live chat uh nino says what would you consider yourself a web designer a web developer um i consider myself a developer that does design occasionally when when i need to so we don't really have where i work at we don't have a dedicated web designer so i do have to do some of that work but it's it's i think a small part of of what i do so i've with a lot of help from google's material design i've developed a style guide for university websites and then i basically follow that style guide so i don't have to come up with brand new designs every time i just i i use you know basic framework that is that i've developed and then you know design some elements as needed if something new comes up uh john says it's usually the people here on chat who let jesse know about the cool keyboard shortcuts yeah that's for sure you all give me so many uh really awesome uh tips about stuff like that i learned so much from you all um how many says is it possible to work as a developer for free like for donation uh like a donation yeah okay so i'm not i'm not 100 sure how you mean that like you could donate your services to someone else that's definitely possible um i i do that for uh some organizations around here like some nonprofits um or are you saying like people would donate to you for your work that's also possible um so the um uh was it henry's henry zhu uh he's at leftpad on twitter um he recently uh quit his fulltime job to volunteer to maintain the babble repository fulltime and he right now he's living off of donations so the last time i heard i think it was up to like um on his patreon uh they've donated it's like three thousand dollars a month for him to work uh full time on um on this open source project on babel so i think that's really cool that that would actually be pretty awesome to do okay oh and darshan says volunteermatch.org has some coding positions okay cool i've never been to volunteermuch.org but that might be you know cool to check out all right wow i've finally gotten to the bottom of the chat today was uh we had a lot in the chat which is awesome i always loved that a lot of new people so thank you all for watching um and especially for the new people thank you so much and thanks for letting me know how you how you got here and how you found this and you know i'd love to see you back at some point and if any of y'all have any um any advice for how this stream could be better you know what you liked or disliked about it you know please let me know uh i won't get upset if you have any criticism uh i really do want to make this stream better for you all so you know i welcome any any type of criticism or or advice you have uh so i should be back tomorrow trying to think about my schedule tomorrow all right i don't remember when my schedule is tomorrow i definitely have meetings in the morning so the stream won't be in the morning it'll more than likely be sometime in the afternoon uh eastern time uh but i'll try to schedule stream as early as i can i'll post on twitter i'll post on instagram uh so if you're interested uh and you you want to get notifications definitely um subscribe to freecodecam's channel turn on notifications if you'd like you can also follow me on twitter and or instagram and i'll i'll post something about that too just to let you know streams gonna happen um yeah and i thank you all so much again uh and until tomorrow have a wonderful day
