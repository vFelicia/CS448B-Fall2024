01:55 - this big course like I like I always
01:58 - wanted to make free content um and you
02:01 - know when we first started out I was I
02:02 - was pressured into monetizing it which I
02:05 - really didn't want to do um and so I had
02:08 - to I had to do that and fail and luckily
02:10 - that failed which was great and so then
02:12 - I was able to take these giant courses
02:14 - that would not normally be free and make
02:16 - them free which is which is really
02:18 - exciting yeah yeah we're all about free
02:21 - and uh I just want to take a moment to
02:23 - thank the
02:26 - 8,562 kind folks around the world who

02:36 - are a huge help and they make
02:38 - programming like this possible they make

02:56 - and again thank you to Andrew for just
02:59 - supporting free Cod Camp through this
03:01 - amazing wealth of learning resources
03:04 - that you share uh I I mean it seems like
03:07 - you published probably five or six
03:09 - courses a year at least like it's it's
03:11 - amazing how quickly you develop like
03:14 - updated like the the moment one of these
03:16 - certifications updates uh it's like
03:19 - you're right there right or the moment a
03:21 - new certification launches we'll talk
03:23 - about like the GitHub certifications in
03:24 - a little bit yeah that was fast the
03:26 - moment it comes out you're like there
03:28 - with uh with your camera out like having
03:31 - already passed the exam ready to like
03:33 - explain exactly how people can you know
03:36 - pass the like you've passed I don't know
03:38 - how many certification exams do you
03:41 - think you've passed in your career as a
03:43 - you know prep you know instructor I
03:46 - don't know like it's Le like at least 30
03:49 - at least 30 unique unique certifications
03:52 - and you know what's really weird is like
03:53 - I actually have to fail them now because
03:55 - what I learned was that um if I pass
03:59 - them I can't take the updated exam so
04:02 - like I have to go in and then I have to
04:03 - fudge them but sometimes I end up
04:04 - passing and I'm not supposed to but I
04:07 - just like want to so do you know what I
04:09 - mean like I'm just like I'll pass it but
04:12 - uh yeah I don't know it's just um uh
04:14 - after you do so many it becomes uh
04:18 - trivial so which is a good thing right
04:20 - you put the time in you can do anything
04:22 - yeah the mob boss is telling you to
04:23 - throw the fight but you're just like I
04:25 - got to pass it I can't hold back my
04:27 - knowledge of cloud yeah so cool well
04:31 - before you were a exam you know expert
04:36 - uh in in passing all these different
04:38 - Cloud exams of course you worked as a
04:39 - CTO but before that you had kind of a
04:44 - family business around computer repair
04:47 - still exists okay awesome maybe you can
04:49 - tell us a little bit about like your
04:51 - humble Origins as somebody repairing
04:53 - computers and working with your family
04:55 - on this you know our family business
04:57 - came about because you know my mom she
04:58 - was in uh
05:00 - was system administrator for or just the
05:03 - admin for Bell in our in our hometown so
05:05 - bell bell Canada which is a telecom
05:08 - company they had a large presence in our
05:10 - our town and so she managed is it
05:11 - related to like AT&T American Telegraph
05:14 - and telephone so they had like the the
05:17 - southern southwestern bill was the Texas
05:20 - and Oklahoma uh phone company and they
05:23 - got broken up into a whole bunch of
05:24 - different baby bells so it's possible
05:27 - that this was like a Canadian you know
05:31 - I've seen like I've seen like Bell and
05:33 - AT&T I thought Bell was Canadian because
05:35 - I thought Alexander Bell was Canadian
05:37 - but um for what I again I I don't know
05:40 - the logistics of it but all I know is
05:41 - that we had a large presence of Bell in
05:44 - I'm in Ontario in Northwest Ontario and
05:47 - so um they had uh they they had new
05:50 - ownership um and they built a big
05:52 - expensive building it turns out that was
05:54 - too expensive and so then they down
05:56 - downsized the uh want Hometown and my my
05:59 - mom didn't want want to move to Toronto
06:00 - she wanted to stay up North with her
06:01 - family um and so uh she took all the
06:04 - skills that she learned from uh being an
06:06 - administrator and then went into
06:07 - computer repair um and so that was the
06:10 - entrepreneurial business and so that's
06:13 - where I was fixing computers and um I
06:16 - transitioned from there doing uh Tech
06:18 - education so like I've been doing it
06:20 - forever um where I would go on site and
06:22 - I would train train people at their
06:24 - homes on their
06:26 - computers yeah well that is so cool
06:29 - first of all I had no idea that
06:31 - Alexander granbell was Canadian I think
06:34 - you learned something new every day and
06:36 - uh according to wikkipedia
06:38 - uh yes Bell Canada divested from
06:42 - AT&T I'm not sure what exactly that
06:44 - means I maybe they were involved in AT&T
06:47 - at some point anyway this is not the
06:49 - corporate History Podcast this is the
06:51 - learn to code podcast but still is it
06:53 - it's it's cool so um so that's cool your
06:57 - mom was a admin early on and uh so maybe
07:03 - you can talk about like the dayto day
07:05 - like did they start the company where
07:06 - you were still a kid were you able to
07:07 - work there when you were a kid or like
07:09 - how old were you when you got your first
07:10 - job I remember uh I think it was like 95
07:13 - or 96 was when uh my mom opened uh the
07:17 - business uh and so I mean as early as
07:21 - like 15 16 I was I was there cuz it
07:24 - started it started at in our house in
07:26 - our basement right um and so we had
07:28 - computers there
07:30 - and then she got an office and uh you
07:33 - know I just I just love computers like I
07:36 - I was always on computers and um you
07:40 - know I was always trying to to help my
07:41 - mom whe whether it was writing word word
07:44 - perfect macros MH doing PowerPoint
07:48 - presentations uh anything right and so
07:52 - um you know I just became really good at
07:54 - uh web
07:56 - Technologies and things like that and so
07:58 - you know she was was giving me work
08:00 - because she was getting referred to
08:01 - build websites and other things like
08:03 - that and she didn't know how to do it um
08:05 - and so I took on that work and then
08:07 - because I was good at doing that and
08:09 - that was not causing any issues I was
08:10 - allowed to then fix computers and uh do
08:13 - repairs and things like that so so just
08:15 - from creating simple macros for
08:17 - Microsoft Word you you gradually
08:19 - progress and so it sounds like you had
08:21 - like an early love of computers and
08:25 - Technology I used to be I used to go
08:27 - take uh college courses like when I was
08:29 - 10 so like I like just like if it was
08:31 - computer anything it would be like we're
08:32 - going to do the whole Microsoft Word
08:34 - Suite or and like and I just wanted to
08:36 - go do that and I would I'd be like so
08:38 - excited to do word processing or or
08:40 - anything like it like it was on
08:42 - Photoshop or whatever as a kid that's
08:45 - that was my extra uh extracurricular
08:47 - activities was was doing that kind of
08:49 - stuff um so I have like college
08:52 - certificates when I'm like 10 or 12 for
08:55 - random
08:57 - Technologies yeah that's so cool so
08:59 - sounds like very early on did you would
09:01 - you say you envisioned yourself working
09:03 - with computers for the rest of your life
09:04 - like it was there a specific point where
09:06 - you're like yeah this is what I do this
09:07 - is who I am or was it just kind of a
09:09 - gradual progression I I I just think it
09:12 - was just like that fascination of it I
09:14 - mean yeah there's the aspect it was the
09:15 - family business and so like my brother
09:16 - fixed computers and I fixed computers
09:18 - but um and my my two sisters worked at
09:21 - the company for for a while but uh it
09:23 - just seemed like that was what I was
09:25 - destined to do because it was the trade
09:27 - of of the family yeah
09:30 - well what were some of your earliest
09:32 - memories of using computers like what
09:34 - were some were there any inflection
09:35 - points where you're like did just pulled
09:37 - you in deeper like I remember I I often
09:40 - talk about nintendo.com their chat room
09:42 - and like talking to different people and
09:43 - realizing hey I can use HDML to like
09:45 - change the font size and it'll change
09:48 - the font size for everybody so I'd like
09:49 - troll people making the font really
09:51 - large um because it was just such a
09:53 - poorly built like you know chat room
09:56 - system from like 1994 1995
09:59 - like do do you remember like any sort of
10:02 - like moments that just pulled you in
10:03 - deeper into technology I mean like I
10:07 - remember playing kmen San Diego and I
10:08 - was really obsessed with that it was
10:10 - like I think like 92 like I was like
10:12 - probably five or six and I just I loved
10:14 - playing K in San Diego and like I
10:16 - learned how to use the the Doss promp to
10:19 - I mean which doesn't sound that crazy uh
10:21 - now because kids are so uh technically
10:23 - um uh Savvy like even even young kids I
10:26 - would say but like I knew how to work MS
10:29 - dos to to get into any program that I
10:31 - wanted to um and I don't know it's just
10:35 - the fascination of of uh I guess video
10:37 - games or that interactivity like the
10:40 - like the opportunity that you could do
10:41 - with it
10:42 - right yeah yeah 100% Cara San Diego they
10:45 - have a new version of the show on
10:47 - Netflix that my kids love they watch it
10:49 - in Chinese for Chinese they have a new
10:51 - version yeah it's pretty good like she's
10:53 - like like with the m like do you have
10:54 - the map and you run around you put the
10:56 - map on like they have the endgame map is
10:58 - it like the so so like a show it's not
11:00 - it's not like a video game so it's not
11:02 - interactive but she's just like
11:04 - traveling around with her like team of
11:06 - like inventors and other people that are
11:08 - like helping her like her computer
11:10 - person like they always have like the
11:11 - giant vond character and like the Q
11:13 - character essentially like the person
11:15 - who creates the interesting gadgets uh
11:17 - or the person who knows all the fills
11:19 - Carmen in all all these background
11:20 - information for her mission to go
11:22 - undercover as like a museum you know a
11:25 - curator or what whatever uh crazy
11:27 - stories uh but but it's a really cool
11:29 - show um and and yeah that game was
11:32 - really cool and of course I love the
11:34 - where in the world is K San Diego from
11:38 - the TV show as a kid the acappellas yeah
11:41 - the acella I always wanted rockapella
11:43 - there you go I always wanted to be on
11:44 - that game show of course it was never
11:46 - going to happen but um uh I don't know I
11:49 - just always wanted to play that end that
11:51 - end level where they're running around
11:52 - on the map and they they're placing the
11:54 - markers in time and I really wanted to
11:56 - win the uh it was like a pocket
11:58 - translator I always thought that would
11:59 - be really cool to have for whatever
12:02 - reason but uh such a cool show and like
12:05 - such like uh like a celebration of like
12:08 - curiosity and intellectualism in an era
12:11 - that like you know he man smash you know
12:15 - type stuff right maybe this was slightly
12:17 - later this was like in the 90s well how
12:18 - old are you if you don't mind me asking
12:20 - like what year were you born in 87 87
12:23 - Okay cool so you're like seven years
12:24 - younger than me um so yeah you were you
12:27 - you had like internet computers like
12:29 - seven years earlier probably in your
12:31 - life than I did well again because my
12:35 - mom worked for Bell like we had a
12:36 - connection right like I remember before
12:38 - Netscape and having internet yeah you
12:40 - know like before uh which by the way I
12:43 - love Netscape uhet Netscape Navigator it
12:46 - was great um I I mean I wish Firefox was
12:49 - uh still holding holding well as it used
12:51 - to but it's uh a different thing these
12:53 - days yeah well let's let's talk about uh
12:57 - you know what did you do from there so
12:59 - you're working at a family business of
13:01 - course did you dream of branching out
13:03 - and creating your own business did you
13:05 - have like a kind of a Founder bug so to
13:07 - speak that bit you early on and you
13:09 - wanted to be like your mom and start
13:10 - something uh you I I realized I didn't
13:13 - want to create computers forever I I
13:14 - like the idea of building applications
13:17 - programming like like maybe going to
13:19 - like I thought maybe I wanted to go to
13:20 - video games but I realized like at early
13:23 - age that um that
13:24 - industry they're overworked they're not
13:26 - paid well and so I thought okay maybe
13:29 - that's more of a hobby and so um I just
13:31 - got really good I wasn't intentional but
13:33 - I just got really good at websites and
13:34 - web application development and you know
13:38 - for me it was like it it scratched that
13:40 - itch enough and so I just kept running
13:42 - with it yeah and so where did you go
13:46 - from there like getting good is one
13:49 - thing but were you able to do like
13:50 - freelance work oh yeah like um so you
13:54 - know I got all my work through um uh a
13:57 - women organization called perro so you
13:59 - know my mom was a woman a woman
14:01 - entrepreneur and so she knew a bunch of
14:02 - other women entrepreneurs and so I
14:04 - basically built all their websites so
14:06 - anytime there was a website to be built
14:08 - uh I would build it I really wanted to
14:10 - build web applications um but uh there
14:13 - was no demand and no understanding of
14:14 - that in my hometown uh I wanted to move
14:17 - to Toronto I did not have the money and
14:19 - I was trying to get a job there I just
14:21 - see I couldn't even so I like I spent
14:23 - years learning how to build apps and I
14:25 - could do all the work but uh nobody was
14:27 - taking the uh the gamble on me um and so
14:31 - you know one day I had a client um and
14:35 - she wanted to use this open- Source
14:36 - technology called Ruby that was built in
14:38 - Ruby on Rails and uh it was an open
14:41 - source project and it just was not in a
14:42 - great state and so at the time Twitter
14:45 - was starting to kick around and it was
14:47 - like 2008 or something um I yeah early
14:50 - Ruby on Rails project not not the best
14:53 - example of Ruby on rail's capabilities
14:55 - in that it had like the fail whale and
14:57 - would frequently crash but but yes but
15:01 - um uh so anyway they uh this open source
15:05 - project um you know I I knew I knew how
15:09 - to fix it up and so I just said hey this
15:11 - is not a great application for what you
15:13 - want to do uh and so I put two weeks of
15:16 - effort not not being asked but I just
15:18 - started uh working on it um and that Co
15:22 - the the founder of that company decided
15:24 - to hire me remotely and and then move me
15:27 - to to Barcelona where I became the of
15:29 - that company so for years I was like
15:31 - stacking my skills but like I just
15:33 - couldn't get work and like I would go
15:35 - and take a Greyhound bus all the way
15:36 - down to from Thunder Bay to Toronto
15:38 - which was like a oh I don't know like 16
15:41 - hour ride each way or something
15:44 - ridiculous and I would go for one day to
15:46 - go to Toronto to go to like a Meetup um
15:49 - uh just to be around other people that
15:51 - were working with more Advanced
15:52 - Technologies and to try to get an
15:54 - opportunity but you know placers just
15:56 - did not want to hire me because I wasn't
15:57 - local yeah wow and this was obviously
16:00 - like decades before the remote work I
16:03 - guess acceptance before employers
16:05 - accepted that you didn't have to be
16:06 - sitting in a cubicle somewhere where
16:07 - they could come in you know ask you to
16:09 - come in on Sunday or whatever whatever
16:11 - the the you know office space thing is
16:14 - um yeah that so Barcelona this is not
16:18 - like Barcelona Canada this is like
16:20 - Barcelona Spain Barcelona you moved to
16:22 - you moved to Europe yeah yeah but you
16:25 - know what uh uh I did really well there
16:27 - because um in terms of technology they
16:29 - were always like two three year 2 three
16:31 - years behind building what was already
16:33 - built in North America so it's like
16:36 - they're building it for their market
16:37 - right it's like and all we were building
16:38 - was a project manager it was a
16:40 - competitor to to um base camp um so that
16:45 - I mean back then I would have loved to
16:46 - work for base camp but again of course
16:49 - uh no opportunities there so yeah I
16:50 - worked on that and that was uh uh really
16:53 - good um and then from there I just went
16:55 - to a string of startups because I just
16:57 - became really good at uh rapidly
16:59 - building applications and sing them up
17:02 - and so I would find like startups that
17:05 - had seed or preed money and I would come
17:07 - in and I would help them close their
17:10 - round and build their deck and hire
17:13 - their hire their first engineers and
17:16 - scale them to whatever their goal was
17:18 - whether it was like 200,000 to 500,000
17:22 - users and I was really good at it um but
17:25 - that but I was never like really cut in
17:28 - in the same way of the original
17:30 - co-founders because I wasn't there on
17:31 - Day Zero so they they I just never had
17:33 - the same um opportunities yeah so I I
17:37 - grew I grew tired of that not being able
17:40 - to um uh not having the same negotiation
17:43 - skills to uh to to make the money but
17:46 - putting the work in and so then I
17:47 - decided to just do my own firm and just
17:49 - make more money yeah that's so cool that
17:53 - like you got to be on the ground floor
17:55 - of all these SS even if you weren't
17:57 - getting like the founder level of equity
17:59 - which for anybody who's not familiar
18:00 - with like how startups work I'll just
18:02 - give a very very very quick High futin
18:05 - you know uh but basically you have two
18:07 - or three people that come together
18:09 - sometimes it's one person like a lot of
18:11 - big projects don't have C Founders they
18:13 - just have one person starting them but
18:16 - uh then the founders divide up their
18:18 - equity and then they have like a lot of
18:20 - times they'll have like their like 20%
18:23 - for early hires and then 20% for
18:25 - everybody else basically and the
18:27 - founders will keep you know like
18:29 - 30 or 40% depending on how well they can
18:31 - negotiate with investors um so you're
18:35 - not getting the founder Equity of like
18:38 - 10% of the company or something like
18:39 - that 20% of the company you're getting
18:41 - like 1% as like an early hire maybe 2%
18:45 - right something like that well well well
18:46 - in my situation like I was getting a
18:48 - large percentage but um like it' be 10
18:50 - or 15% but there was like yeah but
18:52 - there's strings attached where it's like
18:54 - it it vests over this period and yeah
18:56 - and there's like a cliff it was the
18:57 - cliff and you know what would do they uh
18:59 - it happened twice to me where where it
19:01 - was like they because I was the most
19:04 - expensive employee with the large amount
19:06 - of shares and like if they want to raise
19:07 - another round they want to claw back
19:09 - that stuff and so they like I got let go
19:12 - one like one time and the other time
19:14 - it's just like I don't know the point
19:17 - was is that startups are are very tricky
19:19 - and uh you have to be very good at
19:21 - advocating for yourself and making sure
19:23 - you're looking it for yourself because
19:24 - these it's all about money right yeah
19:26 - and uh at the end of the day it's like
19:27 - if you leave yourself open
19:29 - for people to take things away from you
19:31 - they will uh and it's just the nature of
19:33 - that uh of that industry unfortunately
19:35 - so yeah I mean it's a Zer some you know
19:37 - like every percent that we don't have to
19:39 - give to Andrew Brown we can keep for
19:40 - ourselves that kind of uh and people get
19:43 - really weird about money
19:45 - I I mean I think I think it's also hard
19:47 - because it's like you know I don't think
19:48 - people are always trying to be a bad
19:50 - person but just like it can mess with
19:52 - your mind uh or justifications uh uh um
19:56 - tap in but if you ever seen the show
19:57 - silic and Valley
19:59 - yeah it was like that that's what it was
20:01 - like it was like that every every day it
20:03 - just it was a little bit too wild for me
20:05 - but uh yeah you just have to have a lot
20:07 - of luck and um and uh negotiating skills
20:10 - and things like that yeah I have a lot
20:12 - of friends who are startup veterans who
20:14 - started watching silon Valley and
20:16 - stopped because they were like this is
20:17 - giving me like flashbacks of like
20:19 - horrible experiences yeah for years I
20:21 - watch yeah for years I wouldn't watch
20:23 - that show I just like I was I couldn't
20:24 - take it but now it's now it's fun um I
20:27 - think I think the industry is in a
20:28 - different place but that was just a time
20:29 - and place how it was so yeah well Time
20:30 - Heals all wounds right like uh you could
20:33 - probably go back and watch it now and
20:34 - laugh about it you know yesterday's
20:36 - tragedy is today's comedy uh not in all
20:39 - circumstances but in some certain
20:40 - circumstances for sure uh so yeah that
20:43 - that is a show like de definite
20:45 - recommended viewing for anybody who
20:47 - wants to work in Tech uh it just
20:49 - highlights the absurdity of zero
20:51 - interest rate you know crazy you know
20:53 - Venture Capital funded growth and like
20:56 - incompetence at the incumbent players
20:58 - that are being disrupted by the
21:00 - newcomers and all this stuff it so all
21:02 - those different Dynamics you get in
21:04 - Silicon Valley and San Francisco like
21:06 - the kind of the mecca of tech so to
21:10 - speak like uh and and Toronto of course
21:13 - has a pretty pretty good developer scene
21:15 - as well right oh yeah for for Canada
21:17 - yeah it's um yeah fin fintech healtech
21:22 - uh a for some reason ml's always been I
21:24 - mean I'm sure everybody thinks they're
21:25 - an ml Hub but like yeah ml has been
21:28 - heavy Focus for for years for Toronto
21:30 - yeah yeah yeah and mL of course stands
21:32 - for machine learning which is what
21:34 - powers all the AI products that are
21:35 - coming out uh
21:37 - so wow so you did this kind of like rent
21:41 - a CTO type uh basically approach where
21:45 - everybody brought you in you were the
21:47 - fixer like like a bunch of BU business
21:50 - guys who don't know very much about
21:52 - technology they they're able to get
21:54 - funding but they don't have the chops to
21:55 - actually build and ship so they bring
21:58 - and you the fixer the the the server
22:02 - Whisperer yeah I I mean like the thing
22:04 - was it was more like it was like I mean
22:08 - they thought what they were doing was
22:09 - they were uh working to like it was
22:11 - contract to hire so they're like we want
22:13 - to call you C we want you to be CTO we
22:15 - want to give you shares i' be like no I
22:17 - don't want shares just give me money
22:18 - just give me money and and if things go
22:20 - really well then maybe I'll think about
22:21 - it but you know for me I was I was just
22:24 - stacking money at that point and like I
22:26 - had a different co-founder at the time
22:27 - and and that's
22:29 - uh what we were doing because we wanted
22:30 - to bootstrap something we really wanted
22:32 - to do right so we wanted to build like a
22:34 - product like a tech product or I always
22:36 - wanted to do Tech education but it
22:38 - wasn't the interest of my previous
22:39 - co-founder um and it just we weren't
22:42 - never getting there it was just like we
22:43 - were just building thing after thing and
22:46 - we're building up this team of a firm
22:47 - with developers and I'm just like I
22:49 - don't like doing this I don't want to
22:51 - keep building projects for other people
22:53 - that I don't believe in uh even if it
22:55 - makes really good money and so we had to
22:57 - talk and and we said it's time to do
22:59 - something different yeah and I just want
23:01 - to like highlight what you said there
23:02 - like just give me money I don't need
23:03 - stock options like a lot of companies
23:07 - will give stock options as a form of
23:08 - incentive and stuff and you know if it's
23:11 - like a big public company that you're
23:13 - working for like Walmart or Amazon or
23:15 - something like that that's it's almost
23:16 - kind of like free money in the sense
23:17 - that like though you are going to be
23:19 - able to liquidate those stock but
23:21 - certainly in the US if you get a bunch
23:23 - of stock from like a company like uber
23:25 - and Uber just takes forever to go public
23:27 - they they might have like this like
23:28 - there were a lot of people who worked at
23:30 - early engineers at
23:32 - Uber who um by the way super pumped
23:35 - documentary shows you just how evil that
23:37 - company was the Evil Genius of Travis
23:41 - kenic uh of course played by uh Joseph
23:44 - Gordon Levitz I strongly recommend
23:46 - people watch that show uh I think it's
23:48 - on Netflix um yeah super cool show just
23:52 - showing you how Makia like if you don't
23:54 - care about the rules and you just break
23:56 - all the rules like H it was is like it's
23:59 - definitely like watching like Breaking
24:00 - Bad where you're like almost rooting for
24:02 - the bad guy but you know he's so bad and
24:04 - you feel so guilty for like empathizing
24:06 - and like wanting him to win but
24:09 - anyway a lot of people at Uber had like
24:13 - millions of dollars worth of shares that
24:15 - they couldn't exercise because there was
24:16 - no exit and there was like this Sunset
24:19 - the lockin Peri or I can't remember what
24:21 - it's called but basically you have to
24:24 - exercise your options and if you don't
24:25 - exercise them before this date then and
24:28 - and but at the same time you have to pay
24:30 - a whole bunch of tax whenever you
24:32 - exercise those options so there were
24:34 - people who like literally didn't have
24:35 - the cash on hand to get millions of
24:37 - dollars worth of you know theoretical
24:40 - gains that they would get once Uber
24:42 - eventually went public and of course it
24:43 - did go public but we didn't know at the
24:46 - time when that was going to happen so
24:47 - people would have to be like going out
24:49 - and borrowing a whole bunch of money to
24:50 - pay off the tax liabilities for
24:52 - exercising these options buying a bunch
24:53 - of uber that might never actually be
24:56 - worth anything so a lot of people just
24:57 - walked away from their Uber shares
25:00 - because of that um so you know win and
25:03 - doubt just take money because well
25:06 - you're concentrating your risk right
25:08 - you're already working for the company
25:09 - so your month-to-month livelihood is
25:11 - tied up in that and you know companies
25:15 - may be like show how much you believe in
25:16 - the company buy a bunch of you know like
25:19 - I If your employer is ever trying to
25:21 - sell you equity in in their own company
25:24 - like I would definitely be like
25:26 - concerned uh I it's a nice to have but
25:29 - it's not not to not to uh uh um displace
25:33 - what you should be paid and so you know
25:36 - like it's not like it's bad but it's
25:38 - just like if you don't have the the the
25:40 - finance sense to make sense of it I just
25:43 - I still don't I'm just terrible at it
25:44 - that I just like forget it let's not do
25:46 - that uh let's let's do what we we know
25:49 - it's going to work and um you know I
25:52 - again I just got away from startups and
25:54 - like my company I don't call it a
25:56 - startup because we don't have any
25:59 - uh investors we don't want investors we
26:01 - don't want to get acquired um there's no
26:04 - it's just like we just want to keep it
26:06 - going and build a large catalog for free
26:08 - stuff and that's that's the goal right
26:11 - like yeah once you take investor dollars
26:13 - you're strapping kind of a time bomb to
26:15 - your back and yeah it's like it's like
26:17 - have you ever seen the movie Speed with
26:19 - Keo Reeves like the if the bus drops
26:21 - below 50 miles an hour it'll explode and
26:23 - kill all the tourists on board and all
26:26 - the working moms and everybody that's on
26:27 - the bus they all trapped on this bus
26:29 - it's like barreling down the highway The
26:31 - Unfinished Highway um in La like that's
26:34 - probably the most unrealistic thing
26:35 - about it that you would actually be able
26:36 - to move 50 miles an hour in LA but um
26:40 - but it's like that like once you take on
26:43 - investor money you're expected to keep
26:44 - the bus going 50 miles an hour and if
26:46 - you go up to 60 boom it's like a
26:48 - ratcheting effect like oh you can't go
26:49 - less than 60 that that you have to keep
26:51 - growing you can only move in One
26:53 - Direction so I definitely think it's
26:55 - it's preent and wise for you to ass
26:59 - to uh investors if you start a charity
27:02 - like free C Camp people literally can't
27:04 - invest and you can't own any Equity so
27:07 - it just completely like simplifies a lot
27:09 - of those decisions one of the reasons I
27:11 - I chose to make free C Camp uh a charity
27:14 - and I donated all the equity that I had
27:17 - I had like I don't know like 90 plus% of
27:19 - the equity uh we didn't never have any
27:21 - in investors or anything so um yeah I
27:24 - just donated that to free C Camp for
27:26 - zero dollars when we got our tax exempt
27:29 - status and uh yeah like since then it's
27:32 - just been really simple we don't have
27:33 - anybody telling us mush mush mush move
27:36 - faster move faster and it sounds like
27:38 - you don't have to worry about that
27:38 - either who are the key State like other
27:40 - than the other Andrew the other treky
27:43 - Canadian uh who who else cares about the
27:47 - decisions you all make like who else is
27:49 - involved I mean we have our small team
27:51 - like I we got Sam we got Cindy we got
27:53 - Peter uh we've had other other other
27:55 - folks that are here but we just keep a a
27:57 - very small small team um you know like
28:01 - if there's no need to grow the team
28:03 - there's there's no reason to right
28:04 - because it's just stuff that you have to
28:05 - maintain down the road so like for
28:07 - instance you know like if we start
28:09 - making uh more money because there's a
28:11 - popular certification doesn't mean that
28:12 - you should upscale and hire more people
28:14 - because what happens when that deflates
28:16 - which is kind of like what we saw with
28:18 - covid or or other or or or or other
28:20 - organizations like that um so you know
28:23 - growth is not important as longevity of
28:27 - the company and Mak making sure that the
28:28 - key people that are here are being taken
28:30 - care of whether that is making sure they
28:32 - have good health insurance good good uh
28:34 - job security um and making sure that you
28:37 - know we can make money while also being
28:39 - honest right so like we're we're te
28:41 - we're we're a for-profit but we operate
28:44 - not very well for profit in the sense
28:46 - that like we make enough right but it's
28:48 - not to the point where it's at the
28:50 - detriment of of the the person like I'm
28:53 - not out here going like hey you have to
28:55 - like you should get certifications and
28:57 - you should get
28:58 - certifications um and try to upsell you
29:01 - like I'll be honest with you I'll be
29:02 - like hey I think that uh this is
29:04 - something you can do and it's very
29:05 - popular and you're going to do it
29:06 - because everyone's telling you to do it
29:08 - I think there's better ways to do it I'm
29:09 - going to make the content at least free
29:11 - and have affordable tier so you can
29:12 - support me so at least you don't waste
29:14 - your money you know what I mean like I
29:15 - just want people to I just want people
29:18 - like you know get a fair like a fair
29:19 - deal or or as as cheap as as cheap as
29:22 - possible if that makes sense yeah
29:25 - terrible business model that does make
29:26 - sense like but
29:28 - you're optimizing for longevity you're
29:30 - not optimizing for having a yacht that's
29:33 - right yeah yeah so I mean obviously
29:38 - certifications are the the key that's
29:41 - what people want it's it's kind of like
29:43 - a a an addition to a university degree
29:46 - if you have a University degree or if
29:48 - you don't have a University degree it's
29:49 - a way of proving competence from some
29:52 - Arbiter um objective Arbiter whether
29:54 - that's Amazon or Microsoft or one
29:57 - CompTIA one of these these other
29:58 - organizations that certifies people it
30:01 - it is like independent verification of
30:04 - your skills um
30:07 - and why certifications in
30:11 - 2024 why are certifications so important
30:13 - in your mind I mean um you know you know
30:17 - my my thought process is that
30:19 - certifications they they are a goalpost
30:21 - so there's something to work towards and
30:23 - they're structured learning um I I would
30:27 - say that I like the idea of
30:28 - certifications I like the idea of of it
30:31 - over diploma programs because they can
30:33 - be more agile uh uh more up toate more
30:38 - practical closer to what the industry
30:39 - wants uh whereas I think that schools um
30:44 - they're under like they like there's
30:46 - regul there's regulations and stuff like
30:48 - how schools have to operate and
30:50 - obviously the reason why certifications
30:51 - came about was because like you you go
30:54 - to a compsite program in my hometown and
30:56 - and they're teaching you uh per from 9
30:59 - years ago and they don't ever update
31:00 - their curriculum right um and then
31:02 - there's this huge process to update it
31:04 - and so I you know I feel that it Ser
31:05 - service in need um so in in theory I
31:08 - like the idea of certifications but um I
31:11 - think the biggest problem with
31:12 - certifications as of as of today is that
31:15 - um these organizations are in a growth
31:17 - mindset like as of like as of today I
31:19 - found out like adabs laid off hundreds
31:21 - of employees from uh their training
31:23 - certification scene because it
31:25 - wasn't wasn't growing right either
31:28 - monetary whatever stuff and so we saw uh
31:32 - like strange behavior for the last six
31:33 - months where uh we had people like pro
31:37 - pro providing false expectations of what
31:39 - the outcomes of the certifications are
31:41 - so like they don't guarantee jobs but
31:43 - they do definitely get you a foundation
31:45 - of skills that are going to be useful um
31:48 - but I I think there's an issue where you
31:49 - have these organizations and it's not
31:51 - just us all of them um where not all of
31:55 - them but most of them most of them most
31:56 - of them where they are
31:58 - um uh they started out good and they
32:00 - were good for a period of time and now
32:02 - they're getting into territory of like
32:04 - okay now we're just here to get the
32:05 - money um and so I'm not saying stop stop
32:08 - taking certifications like I'm still
32:10 - rolling out like I think like six eight
32:12 - of us refreshes and I still believe in
32:14 - in in the content it's just more like
32:16 - align your expectations and think about
32:18 - how it's going to fit in reaching your
32:20 - goals right so if that makes sense maybe
32:23 - we could start like that's so
32:24 - interesting that you see like changes in
32:26 - the way the certifications are being uh
32:29 - you know essentially put out there
32:31 - maintained like you can't lay off I
32:34 - think you said hundreds of people is it
32:35 - really hundreds of people they said
32:37 - hundreds they said between um they said
32:39 - specifically sales and uh TNC were were
32:43 - the largest cut so we don't really know
32:46 - stands for training and certifications
32:48 - training and certification so they're
32:49 - directly involved for making their shts
32:52 - and providing like uh certifications
32:55 - they said they're going to move towards
32:56 - um on Dem and and work with um other
33:00 - vend like third party vendors but they
33:03 - could call me whenever they want but
33:05 - yeah but yeah those hypothetical third
33:07 - party vendors who uh they're they're so
33:10 - proactive about reaching out to you and
33:11 - involving you right not really well well
33:14 - I think we saw the other day about um
33:16 - what was the project it was uh FFM Peg
33:18 - where they were saying hey you can reach
33:21 - out to us whenever they want they say
33:22 - well maybe the channels aren't you know
33:24 - like I'm like no no they know who I am
33:26 - they can reach out whenever they want
33:27 - there's nothing stopping them so so
33:29 - people take it's like you can't speak up
33:31 - or you can't uh you have to like work a
33:33 - particular way but it's just sometimes
33:35 - it's just they don't want to for
33:36 - whatever reason so yeah yeah well um
33:40 - well one thing I want to talk to you
33:41 - about is just like the various
33:44 - certification you know ecosystems if you
33:47 - will like Microsoft has theirs uh Amazon
33:52 - Google uh I think uh hashy corp hashy
33:56 - corp link Foundation
33:58 - Linux Foundation of course yeah we
33:59 - worked with them who maybe you could
34:02 - rattle off like the big players in the
34:04 - space and um maybe some of the big
34:07 - certifications like just for the sake of
34:10 - every like I I'll take notes and I'll
34:12 - add these in the the notes um I always
34:14 - take notes during these so if you hear
34:15 - like a little keyboard clut it's not me
34:17 - like responding to emails or anything
34:19 - it's like I am furiously taking notes
34:21 - I've already got like four pages of
34:23 - notes from talking with Andrew here so
34:25 - um yeah if you could just r a off like
34:28 - who the players are and what they
34:30 - specialize in I mean we have Tech
34:32 - certification Cloud certifications
34:34 - Network Focus certifications security
34:36 - certifications those are our broad four
34:37 - categories I think I said four um and so
34:41 - you know when things
34:42 - started at least like as far as I
34:44 - remember like there were Tech
34:45 - certifications like the A+ certification
34:48 - and whatever other CompTIA
34:50 - certifications and like even back at
34:53 - like at our family family store back in
34:55 - the late 90s early 2000s those things
34:58 - were important getting an A+
34:59 - certification especially working
35:00 - computer store people cared about those
35:02 - um we saw other organizations that spun
35:05 - up security Sears um and trying to like
35:08 - ccsp and things I forget the the parent
35:11 - organization but like their their
35:13 - process for accredit Edition was
35:14 - extremely uh involved like you had to uh
35:18 - uh show that you worked in the industry
35:20 - for so many years and you had to have
35:22 - another security expert vouch for you
35:24 - and the exam was broken into two
35:26 - separate parts so like the um uh the
35:30 - evaluation process was extremely
35:32 - extremely involved uh but you knew that
35:34 - you were getting uh very good uh uh
35:37 - people so the CT actually mattered right
35:40 - um I think for a while people talked
35:41 - about that they're saying like they
35:43 - didn't like how hard the requirements
35:44 - were it was considered gatekeeping so be
35:47 - some relaxing in there uh Microsoft
35:49 - always made certifications for years and
35:51 - years um before they weren't role based
35:53 - they were like per per um per techn
35:57 - technology and that was good for a long
36:00 - time but they just oversaturated their
36:02 - their Library they used to be very
36:04 - Hands-On like very lab driven um and it
36:07 - was a really great way to evaluate it
36:09 - but then uh they moved away from that
36:10 - maybe for cost purposes or uh they just
36:13 - over satat to the market and everything
36:14 - has now moved over to role Bas
36:15 - certifications right so I think us us
36:18 - was Ro an example of a role would be
36:21 - devops or site reliability engineer or
36:23 - something exactly like a title like that
36:25 - and so it was eight of us that really
36:26 - kicked that off um
36:28 - and for a while they were they were the
36:30 - leader uh I would say like 20 2014 to
36:33 - 2018 they were they were really uh uh
36:37 - they they really had this new model of
36:39 - like uh like the the certificate like
36:42 - the the the attestment part wasn't as
36:44 - hard you know what I mean it was just
36:45 - like a a multiple choice exam uh the
36:48 - content was short like shorter it was
36:50 - more role based it made sense at the
36:52 - time uh and then we saw Microsoft they
36:54 - started uh moving over to that and when
36:56 - Google wrote uh rulers out they did that
36:58 - as as well and so um you know I think
37:01 - for a while either of us like was was
37:03 - really defining this new new way of of
37:07 - making certifications but um I think as
37:09 - time went on um uh you know the novelty
37:14 - of cloud is worn off uh now we want uh
37:16 - people with like like you're not no
37:19 - one's looking for cloud Consultants
37:20 - anymore everyone knows how like how to
37:21 - work with Cloud now so now they want
37:23 - people with heart attac fundamental
37:25 - skills whether you a developer or uh
37:29 - like a network engineer or something
37:30 - else and then applying that to cloud and
37:33 - so um the uh the bar has not raised in
37:37 - terms of that um testing process like we
37:40 - talked about like those security Sears
37:41 - that were yeah Heavy Hitters and I think
37:43 - there needs to be an adjustment either
37:45 - the expectations of the outcomes of
37:46 - these certifications need to be realized
37:49 - and um be properly promoted not to false
37:52 - expectations or the evaluation process
37:55 - has to change so um do that Mak sense
37:57 - just to kind of recapitulate what you're
37:59 - saying the tests either need to be
38:00 - harder or they need to temper their
38:04 - marketing for what a certification is
38:06 - going to help you achieve either one one
38:08 - or the other right because um you know
38:10 - and it's just I would just say eight of
38:11 - us is is is in the the the hot seat
38:14 - right now whereas Microsoft has made
38:17 - some uh improvements like they have some
38:19 - some select tests they've made it open
38:21 - book so like you can go up to look at
38:23 - the documentation while taking the exam
38:25 - they've brought back some of their Labs
38:27 - um um Microsoft has been really good
38:29 - about like the Azure exams about
38:31 - actually using the tech I would just say
38:34 - the only frustration frustrating part
38:35 - about doing Microsoft exams is that
38:37 - their services are
38:39 - sprawling and so in theory their exams
38:42 - are are uh are well executed it's just
38:45 - that their technolog is a a pain to use
38:48 - in my opinion but um uh you know I I
38:52 - would probably say that Microsoft's
38:53 - doing the best uh with with their like
38:56 - how they're engineering their
38:56 - certification
38:58 - and their curriculum and and the issues
39:00 - they're having is not necessarily the
39:01 - exams it's more just the nature of of
39:04 - the state of their products because
39:05 - they're so rapid developing right like
39:07 - they're they're out there and like I
39:10 - just imagine them in a boardroom trying
39:11 - to like get a sale from like a school or
39:14 - or something else and they go around the
39:16 - table everyone says has to have this has
39:17 - to have has to have that and they go
39:20 - okay it has all that stuff and then they
39:22 - roll up those products and so their
39:24 - stuff is a bit more mishap but it does
39:26 - work in the end that's always been
39:28 - Microsoft forever do you know what I
39:29 - mean so there's like a totally different
39:31 - culture from Amon in terms of getting
39:33 - things done even though they're like
39:34 - located just a few miles from one
39:35 - another their headquarters and stuff
39:38 - yeah but but it like Microsoft's fast
39:40 - and loose but it works and like this
39:42 - comes back to like fixing computers like
39:44 - we remember like they would roll out
39:46 - their OS and then you're just like every
39:48 - month you're doing patches because
39:50 - they're fixing things because they just
39:52 - won't stop rolling stuff out but they're
39:54 - meeting the business demands of the
39:56 - organizations and even if it's not
39:58 - immediately they eventually do right and
40:00 - that's why there's such a juggernaut
40:01 - these days yeah yeah yeah I mean is it's
40:04 - been impressive just how uh I mean
40:06 - considering how much of a lead aw's had
40:09 - over Microsoft just Microsoft coming in
40:11 - really strong with Azure um yeah it's
40:15 - definitely an exciting company to watch
40:17 - uh to to see the decisions they make and
40:19 - like analyze them in terms of I'm an
40:23 - individual I want to earn some
40:26 - certifications like most of the people
40:28 - probably listening to this are not in
40:30 - control of like a a giant Cloud company
40:32 - trying to like figure out like what a
40:34 - cloud certification strategy might look
40:36 - like most of them are on the other side
40:38 - of it they're devs who want to earn some
40:40 - certifications and want to be able to uh
40:42 - ramp up their earning power ramp up
40:44 - their opportunity in terms of being able
40:46 - to get progressively more advanced roles
40:50 - in security or network engineering or uh
40:53 - you know Cloud engineering maybe you
40:55 - could talk a little bit about what these
40:57 - certifications can do for you in terms
41:00 - of how they can you know help in those
41:04 - regards I think they I think they lay
41:06 - out like a good road map in terms of or
41:08 - of the landscape of what you need to
41:09 - cover because once you cover something
41:11 - like let's say infrastructure is a code
41:13 - and you've done it in a few different
41:14 - iterations like terraform cloud
41:16 - formation whatever you have that skill
41:18 - right so no matter if Alibaba Cloud says
41:21 - hey we have a new product or there's
41:22 - like a spin-off like like uh Hashi Corp
41:25 - terraform got forked with open tofu or
41:28 - uh you know there's some like thing
41:30 - that's like a control plane that's
41:31 - similar to I the idea is that you have
41:33 - enough transfer uh transferable
41:34 - knowledge to uh to be dangerous and I do
41:37 - feel like there there is a certain
41:40 - amount of knowledge you need to gain
41:41 - over a period of time whether it's three
41:43 - or six years and every year you can
41:44 - tackle something different so like even
41:46 - through my career like uh you know even
41:48 - though I was building apps like it like
41:50 - and I was and I had like a team of
41:52 - developers and uh you know we had like a
41:55 - good amount of uh of users and and
41:57 - traffic or whatever um you know I would
42:00 - still have like a um like like blind
42:03 - spots like I was just like wasn't really
42:04 - good at optimizing SQL and I'm like this
42:06 - is the year I'm going to spend two three
42:08 - months and get really deep SQL knowledge
42:10 - and that never leaves me it's like early
42:11 - in my career it's like I invested that
42:13 - time learning regex right and um now I I
42:17 - get to keep that skill for the rest of
42:19 - my life do I remember all the the
42:20 - details of it no but I I have confidence
42:22 - with it and I I feel that every
42:25 - different type of certification
42:27 - Microsoft all the ones that we've been
42:28 - doing they're there's just like they're
42:31 - they're taking they're covering a part
42:33 - of the pie and so once you've done them
42:35 - you've done them in few different
42:36 - iterations you are now equipped to do
42:38 - anything you want to do like tomorrow if
42:40 - I want to be a data like a data engineer
42:41 - I can go do it if tomorrow I want to
42:43 - beor I can go do it because there's so
42:45 - much overlap of these skills um and so
42:48 - you know I I think that um you know
42:50 - certifications aren't the most efficient
42:52 - way to cover that that landscape of
42:55 - stuff but it's all there right and so if
42:58 - you just keep chipping away at it
42:59 - eventually you'll you'll have all the
43:00 - knowledge and you'll have that Mobility
43:02 - we had we ran a boot camp for was it
43:05 - terraform um uh like the terraform boot
43:07 - camp recently and we used GitHub as the
43:10 - platform and I I did something that I
43:12 - didn't do in the last boot camp was I I
43:13 - made everyone do poll requests um and
43:17 - wow I did not realize how many how many
43:20 - people like in the tech industry that
43:21 - are like in not necessarily developer
43:23 - roles but they're in like it networking
43:25 - or Cloud networking or security like
43:29 - their minds exploded because they didn't
43:31 - realize that they had this huge like
43:33 - missing Gap uh like just like working
43:36 - with GitHub or like just working with
43:39 - code um and so you know there's always
43:42 - these uh like if you can if you can get
43:45 - good coverage of of the fundamentals
43:47 - you're going to be dangerous no matter
43:49 - what you do right 100% I just want to
43:51 - emphasize like I I'll get on my soap box
43:54 - for a moment I think every developer
43:56 - every developer
43:57 - in 2024 should learn the following seven
44:00 - things at least you know dangerous as
44:03 - you said earlier like like you know the
44:06 - saying is you master the fundamentals
44:07 - you never really have to come back to
44:08 - them you've got that Foundation upon
44:11 - which you can build other things you've
44:12 - got all that knowledge that you can use
44:14 - as scaffolding to
44:15 - like Branch out and you know web in
44:19 - other knowledge into your uh inter your
44:21 - kind of like mind map sorry I'm mixing
44:25 - all kinds of metaphors there but I tell
44:27 - everybody you should learn you know HTML
44:29 - CSS JavaScript python
44:33 - Linux git and SQL and I tell people like
44:37 - if you learn those seven Technologies
44:39 - like uh you're going to basically you're
44:42 - you're going to have at least two
44:43 - scripting knowled languages that you
44:45 - know that are very different and their
44:46 - application to different tool ecosystems
44:48 - and stuff Python and JavaScript but
44:49 - you're also going to know databases
44:51 - you're also going to know operating
44:52 - systems you're also going to know
44:54 - Version Control and then HTML CSS are
44:57 - just convenient to know because you
44:58 - never know when you're going to need to
44:59 - build a quick user interface and
45:02 - everything like like even like electron
45:05 - I was talking with Jessica Lord who
45:06 - helped uh who founded the electron team
45:09 - at GitHub like every desktop app that
45:12 - like you launch probably on your desktop
45:14 - these days is probably not everyone but
45:17 - most of them make use of electron and
45:18 - what is that that's just HTML CSS and
45:20 - JavaScript running on a native app like
45:24 - on Windows or on on Mac right yeah um um
45:27 - so there was a uh I actually have deep
45:29 - knowledge on like implementing electron
45:31 - apps because it was like 2017 2018 I
45:34 - built a uh one of my favorite video
45:36 - games is um called um Tetris attack for
45:39 - the Super Nintendo probably love or pen
45:42 - pawn in Japan yep it's it's a high skill
45:46 - game it's deceptively High skill I spent
45:49 - way too much time trying to like get
45:51 - like the the combo system you're saying
45:53 - we could be playing right now any anyway
45:56 - well next time and I get together in
45:57 - person we're going to throw down on some
46:00 - Tetris attack I've got it on my SNES
46:02 - classic I uh uh I I think I it might
46:05 - come stock with it or I modded it but it
46:08 - should yeah yeah it's a great game um
46:10 - but uh so so um uh uh there's a Discord
46:14 - group where uh people play competitively
46:16 - and so I I join that I'm not not as good
46:18 - as they are but um you know they they
46:21 - play with emulators but there's a little
46:24 - bit of delay even with retroarc and so
46:26 - um um I was trying to build a competitor
46:29 - one for the market there was another one
46:30 - that got built in Python that beat me
46:32 - out um and I I got busy I actually
46:34 - before I was doing this that's what I
46:35 - wanted to do I wanted to build a a
46:37 - competitive game of of um Tetris attack
46:39 - but then I ended up building this
46:41 - company um and so I I learned how I
46:45 - learned how to read assembly code for
46:48 - the SNES for the ROM so that I could
46:50 - figure exactly like frame per frame the
46:53 - movements because if the if it didn't
46:55 - have exact frame per frame per mov
46:57 - then they wouldn't competitively play it
46:59 - and so I was basically cloning that and
47:01 - I I built the app in electrona
47:03 - typescript and it it worked pretty well
47:05 - but where I got stuck was um doing the
47:08 - multiplayer so I just I I had an estate
47:11 - where I'm working through U multiplayer
47:12 - and I had to build a simpler Tetris game
47:15 - just to try to figure out the uh the
47:17 - latency issues or like the
47:18 - miscommunication is issues I was having
47:21 - but that's just sitting there and it's
47:23 - postponed definitely it's not done like
47:25 - it's not cancelled but at some point
47:27 - I'll come back yeah and I'll I'll finish
47:30 - that game oh man it's just warm my heart
47:32 - knowing that you're like literally
47:33 - trying to recreate Tetris attack in a
47:36 - you know contemporary environment NE
47:38 - code FR frame for frame yeah yeah and
47:40 - and with Competitive Gaming like
47:43 - probably a lot of people watching this
47:44 - who are in the fighting game Community
47:46 - or something like people literally
47:47 - memorize how much frame every different
47:50 - type of punch in Tekken has or or in
47:53 - Street Fighter because like it all
47:55 - matters like you're you're doing all
47:57 - kinds of calculations in your mind to
47:58 - figure out like whether a combo will
48:00 - work whether it's safe to do a certain
48:02 - move in a certain situation and with
48:04 - Tetris attack like you really have to
48:07 - plan out like like your hands have to
48:09 - move really quick and stuff but also you
48:11 - your mind has to work really quick your
48:13 - eyes have to work really quick and you
48:14 - don't want to be playing on your
48:16 - original SNES and then jumping on like
48:18 - an online client and have the Frame data
48:20 - be even slightly different otherwise it
48:22 - completely throws off your game right uh
48:24 - and people people want that experience
48:27 - there's like what's called classic
48:29 - Tetris on NES I don't know if you have
48:31 - heard about this but people are still
48:32 - playing Tetris on NES like 30 40 years
48:35 - later after the release date um but
48:38 - basically that's the canonical version
48:41 - that everybody plays on the on the
48:42 - original one player uh NES not the
48:45 - Tangen two-player unauthorized Tetris I
48:48 - have the tetris uh movie downloaded
48:50 - though I can't wait to watch that by the
48:51 - way just saw my long list of things to
48:52 - do when I have time
48:54 - but yeah like Frank
48:57 - every frame matters every like making
49:00 - your emulator like especially if it's a
49:02 - competitive game making it
49:04 - exactly um how the original game is is
49:07 - vital or people just will not give it
49:09 - any time of day right that's like table
49:12 - Stakes it is it has to play exactly the
49:14 - same but uh and I was just thinking I'm
49:17 - almost at the point where I can come
49:18 - back to that game so like what and I had
49:20 - a whole team around it it was it was
49:22 - really interesting because I always want
49:23 - to make video games but if you find the
49:24 - right video game that people want want
49:26 - to be made the community will just like
49:29 - materialize so I had like a gra like a a
49:31 - pixel artist and a person that uh that
49:34 - made music and there it was really
49:36 - coming together it's just again it's
49:37 - like couldn't get there in time and uh
49:40 - but I'm almost at a point where I can
49:42 - revisit it and I just as of last week I
49:44 - was spinning up mono game or G mono game
49:47 - mono game which is a um it's an open
49:49 - source um engine uh so it's like writing
49:53 - Unity code except that you if you can if
49:56 - you you could Port it to any uh console
50:00 - and uh you don't have to pay any
50:01 - licensing fees and so I had to rush up
50:03 - on my net skills I was very tempted to
50:06 - make a
50:07 - c c course because my C skills are like
50:10 - really sharp right now but um uh it's
50:14 - just it's like it's fun because in Tech
50:17 - it's like whatever I learn is always
50:19 - transferable right so um you know I
50:21 - spent all that time learning different
50:23 - programming languages and you know one
50:25 - day I'm writing typescript the other day
50:27 - I'm writing C another day I'm writing
50:28 - Java and so again comes back to those
50:30 - seven core skills like you said
50:32 - JavaScript the point is just to get
50:33 - started in in those things and if you
50:35 - get started in those seven things you
50:37 - have all those starting points you just
50:38 - grow those all up right then you're
50:41 - going to be in really good shape um so
50:43 - even if they they seem like trivial like
50:45 - HTML and CSS seem trivial that's not the
50:48 - point the point is is that they're your
50:49 - Stepping Stones to get started right
50:52 - yeah I mean arithmetic may seem trivial
50:54 - but without it you can't do any of the
50:56 - higher math
50:57 - right you or like it's like I wanted to
51:00 - um like I'm coding a prototype gape in
51:03 - mono in in mono game because I uh I want
51:05 - to learn the engine and figure out the
51:08 - the architecture of how I'm going to
51:09 - build my game before I come back to my
51:11 - Swap and pop game yeah and uh while I'm
51:14 - building I'm building a shoot them up
51:15 - because that's like the classic that's
51:16 - in the background to you that you have
51:18 - there bullet hell Shooters so so I'm
51:21 - building a shum up where it's it's it's
51:23 - grocery store theme because I'm always
51:25 - uh I'm always fighting with grocery
51:26 - stores and so um I can you elaborate
51:30 - you're always fighting with grocery
51:31 - stores I I I live in I live in um remote
51:34 - towns and uh the grocery store here is
51:36 - just like pitiful because they they can
51:38 - charge more and the produce isn't great
51:41 - it's not all their F fault because in
51:42 - Canada we have I don't know if the word
51:44 - is uh uh monopolies
51:50 - orop there just a few sell just a few so
51:53 - so there's like there's L Blas and soes
51:55 - and there's Maybe like one from que you
51:58 - think they collude to keep prices High I
52:00 - don't know about I don't think so I mean
52:02 - in certain things they do in certain
52:03 - things like bread there was the bread
52:04 - fixing uh scam of of Canada seriously
52:08 - wow seriously bread is such an important
52:10 - staple like that's scandalous like we
52:12 - talk about white collar crime and stuff
52:13 - but like PE families rely on bread for
52:16 - literal sustenance way back to Rome way
52:19 - back to Egypt right like that that is
52:21 - just like if there's ever something that
52:23 - should be price protected it's bread you
52:26 - know what you know you know how much
52:27 - bread I buy per month cuz I have three
52:29 - young kids like uh
52:31 - six five four and two something like
52:34 - that and anyway so like they sandwich
52:37 - bread is like the biggest staple in my
52:39 - house I wish they would eat rice they
52:41 - just won't eat rice and so I literally
52:43 - buy 40
52:44 - loaves like this big of of whole wheat
52:47 - bread every single month I drive two
52:49 - hours I just did a trip just yesterday
52:52 - that's why we couldn't do the podcast
52:53 - yesterday I did the bread run the bread
52:55 - milk run
52:57 - and like in town it sells for $4 almost
53:01 - $5 and it's like half the size and if I
53:04 - go into to Thunder Bay it at the whole
53:06 - whole Wholesale Club it's like
53:09 - 218 for twice the size yeah and so it
53:12 - adds up right and so I even learned how
53:14 - to like people are watching my like on
53:16 - my Twitter they were probably wondering
53:17 - like why I was so obsessed with making
53:18 - bread the last few months cuz I'm trying
53:20 - to offset my bread cloths and I'm not
53:22 - even kiding W so there's a pract it's
53:24 - not like some hobby that like rich
53:25 - people get really interested in yeast
53:27 - all of a sudden it's like literal like
53:29 - this is costing a fortune well it's just
53:32 - like I don't want to like I want to have
53:33 - self-sufficient skills so I don't go to
53:35 - the the local place and and the it's
53:37 - like partly their fault for overpricing
53:39 - but the other thing is like if you look
53:41 - at if you look at their supplier like
53:42 - their food comes from Family Foods which
53:44 - comes from uh McDonald's Corporation not
53:47 - like McDonald's the the restaurant but
53:48 - like McDonald's the guy named McDonald
53:50 - or something which then comes from soes
53:52 - right and then they set the prices so
53:54 - like there's nothing like if you're a
53:57 - grocery store you have to get your food
53:58 - from somewhere it's going to come from
54:00 - BL Blas it's going to come from soes and
54:03 - there's only so much Flex you have with
54:04 - price yeah I mean like they're passing
54:07 - they have to pass on some cost and they
54:08 - have to have some margin for themselves
54:10 - so the more middlemen you have I guess
54:13 - the price of bread just kind of explodes
54:15 - for the Inc consumer along the way but
54:18 - um but uh that's why I'm kind of like
54:19 - that's why I was making a grocery store
54:21 - like there's two games I I always want
54:23 - to make it's it's uh swap pop which is
54:25 - the uh Tetris attack competitive well in
54:28 - Tetris attack you have two blocks like
54:29 - you have a cursor and you swap the
54:31 - position of two blocks horizontally your
54:33 - only form of interaction right Swap and
54:35 - pop they pop when you get three or four
54:37 - or three in a row vertically or
54:38 - horizontally so so I want to make that
54:40 - my other game is I always wanted to make
54:42 - a grocery store simulator which is like
54:45 - you have like a you have you open a
54:46 - grocery store and you have to you have
54:48 - to manage the inventory and the
54:50 - employees and the visual layout of the
54:52 - store and then you have to deal with
54:54 - competing grocery stores because like in
54:56 - Canada like in my hometown Thunder Bay
54:58 - there was smaller grocery stores that
55:00 - were doing really well and the grocery
55:02 - stores kept trying to buy them out and
55:04 - there was a few where like their
55:06 - familyowned that I know them and and the
55:08 - family regrets not selling out because
55:09 - it's like their whole family lost out on
55:11 - a bunch of money because they ran them
55:12 - in they ran the competition out right so
55:15 - they they were growing they were having
55:16 - multiple stores and then they now
55:18 - they're back to just one store and uh
55:20 - you know it's just the nature of things
55:22 - so I don't know it's just it is what it
55:24 - is but like that's that's my obsessions
55:26 - with these particular
55:28 - things yeah man there was like a I think
55:30 - it was like Bloomberg or something Mall
55:33 - Simulator game browser oh yeah there
55:36 - there's
55:39 - uh yeah uh shopping Tycoon management I
55:44 - I can't remember but there was this
55:45 - newspaper that put together this this
55:46 - really cool like it had pixel art and
55:48 - Chip tune music and everything and it
55:50 - was like a simulation of what it's like
55:52 - to run a mall and of course it's like a
55:56 - nightmare because it's
55:59 - basically um like your tenants are
56:01 - having to move out because malls are not
56:03 - profitable and this was all preo of
56:05 - course uh so there's like even a
56:07 - subreddit like dead malls or abandoned
56:09 - malls or something where people like
56:10 - break into these like you know malls
56:12 - that have basically been like condemned
56:14 - and like explore and Splunk around in
56:16 - like the mold covered you know old movie
56:18 - theaters and stuff is they wear like
56:20 - Hazmat masks and stuff when they go in
56:21 - there but uh yeah like definitely I I
56:25 - can definitely see that being a terrible
56:28 - business to be in in 2024 and making a
56:32 - game about the plight of grocery store
56:34 - owners would be really cool just from
56:36 - like a kind of uh anthropological
56:39 - perspective and also From anolog
56:41 - perspective because I worked in grocery
56:42 - stores like I I didn't have like a cool
56:45 - Mom I mean my mom's very cool but she
56:47 - didn't run like a cool you know business
56:50 - where I could be fixing computers and
56:51 - stuff uh I I would go to the grocery
56:53 - store all the time as a kid and like
56:55 - check out VHS tapes and then later I
56:57 - worked for like two years at grocery
56:59 - store like I show up at 6: a.m. and like
57:01 - mop the entire floor and then I go stock
57:03 - and face the shelves and uh put all the
57:06 - big cardboard boxes into the trash
57:08 - compactor and try not to get my arm
57:09 - caught in there so I didn't have some
57:12 - like childhood industrial accident you
57:14 - know like
57:16 - um I have a lot of nostalgia for just
57:19 - walking around and hearing like you know
57:21 - Kenny G or whatever playing and and like
57:24 - the the FL some bulbs above so I I would
57:28 - definitely play that game if you make it
57:29 - well there's just so many I just there's
57:31 - just so many systems that you can think
57:33 - about in there like what happens when
57:35 - you introduce self checkout what happens
57:37 - when there's like an event like Co what
57:39 - happens when there is a competitor think
57:41 - about like every person that goes
57:43 - through that store like how far do they
57:46 - live to the store uh like all all the
57:49 - attributes of those of those people in
57:51 - simulating that like I like when you go
57:54 - to G where you put Food Matters so like
57:57 - there's a there's an optimization where
57:59 - it's like there's food at the eye level
58:01 - of like there's what at the eye level
58:03 - kids like you put stuff that that catch
58:04 - your attention that's where you put the
58:05 - sugar cereal right cereal like the stuff
58:08 - that you like that's cheap that would
58:09 - save people money but you don't want to
58:10 - buy you put on the bottom shelf the most
58:12 - expensive stuff that is like luxury you
58:14 - put on the top and then like there's
58:16 - like the the the one that's just right
58:18 - below there like there's all these
58:20 - little optimizations you go into the
58:21 - grocery store you smell flowers you feel
58:24 - like oh everything smells good then you
58:26 - see the produce you go everything's
58:28 - Fresh then you go to the bulk you like
58:29 - oh there's good deals they have bulk
58:31 - stuff here there's so pricing in
58:33 - everything too is like a huge deal
58:35 - because you know you can put everything
58:37 - half off or whatever you can get a
58:38 - membership card like then the people
58:40 - that are not members will be all cranky
58:42 - they have to pay like six bucks for a
58:44 - little thing of Greek yogurt instead of
58:46 - paying like four 450 or something right
58:49 - um so you're like pushing people into
58:50 - your to your Rewards program also like
58:53 - one thing I have no idea if this had an
58:54 - impact but if you think about cigarettes
58:56 - right like uh cigarettes were a massive
59:01 - to some they still are in the United
59:03 - States and probably in Canada they're
59:04 - big up here they're like remote towns
59:06 - they're huge right I me think about
59:07 - smokes They Don't Really perish like
59:10 - cigarettes are fresh I guess is fresh as
59:12 - like a cancer stick can be for like
59:14 - probably at least two or three years you
59:16 - can probably have that Carton and it's
59:17 - still consumable right and you have this
59:20 - little carton that costs like 20 bucks
59:23 - or however much cigarettes cost these
59:24 - days and uh it's like 20 or it's like 10
59:28 - packs and it barely takes up any space
59:30 - it's very lightweight it's probably
59:31 - super easy to transport and that was
59:33 - probably like a huge Cash Cow for
59:35 - grocery stores in like the' 60s 7s 80s
59:38 - because you've got all these people that
59:39 - are addicted that smoke like an entire
59:40 - pack a day and they're just coming into
59:42 - your grocery store and it's a reason to
59:43 - get people to come back into your
59:44 - grocery store regularly too I mean like
59:47 - selling milk the margins on milk and
59:48 - bread are not nearly as high as they are
59:50 - on like cigarettes and stuff like that
59:52 - so I imagine that's also decimated this
59:54 - is total speculation by the way and and
59:56 - and thank goodness that the the tobacco
59:58 - industry is in Decline I'll just say
60:00 - I'll just share this anecdote Camel
60:01 - cigarettes when I was a kid and you know
60:04 - I made bad decisions like I smoke camel
60:06 - because Joe Camel you know the cool like
60:08 - James Bond of uh cigarette mascots right
60:12 - and uh so cool yeah Camel cigarettes
60:16 - just that brand Alone 6 million dead
60:22 - Americans 6 million people who died
60:25 - prematurely
60:26 - before their time because of camel so
60:30 - yeah if there's ever been an evil
60:31 - industry it like no question like the
60:34 - most evil industry ever was the
60:36 - cigarette industry anyway I'll I'll end
60:38 - that little uh that little Soap Box
60:41 - thing but but it just blows my mind like
60:44 - there was it it had to be like a bonanza
60:46 - like the the input cost it had to be
60:47 - like the greatest industry of all
60:51 - time uh in terms of just like how little
60:54 - work needed to be done and how much
60:56 - money was like enjoyed by the people who
60:58 - were I guess putting those products out
61:00 - there uh and how little of the cost was
61:02 - actually borne by the companies and how
61:05 - much of it was born by Society in the
61:07 - form of tax that we had to pay to help
61:09 - people who have like 50 pack years or
61:12 - whatever uh year of smoking cigarettes
61:14 - it's called a pack year that have
61:16 - accumulated like all these chronic
61:18 - diseases or you know even uh you know
61:20 - lung cancer anyway sorry this is not a
61:23 - public health podcast but I just felt
61:25 - like talking about that because cuz for
61:26 - me it's like therapeutic to talk about
61:28 - the fact that like I got taken in by
61:29 - this industry and like there was like a
61:31 - year or so that I year or two that I was
61:33 - smoked as a as a kid like as a like
61:36 - young teenager like 13 14 years old 15
61:38 - years old right and um yeah anyway I
61:42 - hope I hope you never smoked and I I
61:45 - hope that none of our kids ever smoke I
61:47 - mean I worked in a bingo hall for years
61:48 - but like that was the closest you could
61:50 - say I smoked but no it's uh no asthma
61:54 - I'm not I'm not I'm notok for anything
61:57 - right you dodge a bullet with your
61:58 - asthma I hope your asthma's okay sorry I
62:00 - don't want me to that yeah it's fine but
62:02 - um you know like building these games
62:04 - aren't a waste they've always they've
62:07 - like any pass passion project I've buil
62:09 - I've always been able to turn into work
62:11 - so you know um markety which was one of
62:13 - my earliest applications I built I I
62:16 - flipped into like my earliest uh like uh
62:18 - uh contracts because people wanted
62:21 - something similar of what it was like
62:23 - Swap and pop that game in particular
62:25 - which is interesting I was just building
62:26 - it for fun but uh you know I I had
62:29 - worked at a previous um ettech startup
62:32 - and um you know I left I left and I
62:35 - interviewed at other edtech startups in
62:37 - Toronto that were education education
62:39 - focused and you know some of them I came
62:41 - pretty close to getting hired but uh um
62:45 - uh you know they they passed for
62:46 - whatever reason but like I took that
62:47 - project that Swap and pop and there was
62:49 - like an organization that was that was
62:51 - an edtech company and they would have
62:53 - hack and tells and you go there and you
62:54 - show off your what you do hack inel so
62:56 - it's like show Intel but hack something
62:59 - together in yeah so you say hey look at
63:00 - this cool project this is how I built it
63:02 - and they walk you walk through the
63:03 - technical stuff it was just it was it
63:04 - was a guys for hiring for this tech
63:06 - company um because they they would give
63:09 - you an award right like a gift
63:10 - certificate or whatever um but really
63:13 - what they were trying to do was hire the
63:14 - best talent and so I i' show this
63:17 - project and I like I like I one hands
63:20 - down because who's who's like going
63:22 - through and breaking down assembly code
63:24 - for a Super Nintendo game to make frame
63:26 - by frame stuff built in an electron app
63:28 - with whatever like talking about like
63:29 - why typescripts good and working with
63:31 - teams I didn't I didn't realize like
63:32 - when you're building a game and you have
63:34 - like four or five other people working
63:35 - on it it's like you need to know where
63:36 - everything is it's not the same as
63:38 - building web apps um and so you know
63:41 - they they they wanted to approach me and
63:42 - hire me I said you already had the
63:44 - chance to hire me you weren't
63:46 - interested but it just like but it's was
63:48 - just like how much of a magnet that
63:50 - project was um and so like any project
63:53 - like even if I was like building this
63:55 - Sim for let's say I was building
63:56 - Simulator for a grocery store like you
63:58 - you have to like I'm basically building
64:00 - uh there's software out there for
64:02 - inventory management and stuff like that
64:03 - for grocery stores do you know what I
64:05 - mean like I'm basically building that
64:07 - stuff um so I always find that you can
64:10 - flip that into work and that's a great
64:12 - way of you know whatever you're building
64:14 - like and people are worried about AI I'm
64:16 - not really worried about it that much
64:17 - like large companies should be like
64:19 - people working in large companies like
64:20 - ads Google whatever should like should
64:22 - be worried because they they know how to
64:24 - utilize it and streamline their uh their
64:27 - uh their Workforce to best utilize it
64:30 - these small companies don't yeah do you
64:32 - know what I mean so there's still lots
64:33 - of opportunity for work there's some
64:35 - there's some people out there saying
64:36 - like oh I I cut back on my customer
64:38 - support okay but they're not cutting out
64:40 - their Tech roles do you know what I mean
64:42 - so um and was it Devon is Devon the
64:46 - thing that yeah I keep hearing about it
64:48 - but I think a lot of it's probably
64:49 - Grassroots or what's it called
64:52 - astroturfing like people pretending to
64:53 - be developers like overstating it
64:55 - there's so much hypee out there but but
64:57 - the thing is what percentage they said
64:59 - like there's like they said there's a
65:01 - percentage of like that it was a
65:03 - percentage that they said that they
65:04 - could complete tasks that like GitHub
65:06 - issues they said it was like 13.9% I'm
65:08 - just like okay but we need 100% and then
65:11 - some so even even if they got 100% it
65:13 - still doesn't matter and a lot of those
65:15 - tasks are probably just like updating
65:16 - the copyright date in the footer and
65:18 - stuff like that like simple stuff that
65:20 - like you and I could probably do with
65:22 - our eyes closed that uh yeah it's cool
65:25 - it's definitely helpful that these tools
65:26 - are out there but I feel like
65:28 - everybody's just swept up in so much
65:30 - hype we could we could talk about this
65:32 - for a long time because like I I I you
65:35 - know like I listen to like interviews
65:38 - with like you know AI luminaries and
65:40 - stuff like that and they're like you
65:41 - don't need to learn to code anymore I'm
65:43 - like dude you're talking your own book
65:44 - you're basically trying to convince
65:46 - people that your product is like the
65:48 - next thing since the best thing since
65:49 - sliced bread since we were talking about
65:51 - earlier a Ty um like V it's like talking
65:54 - about VR or yeah I mean like yeah we'll
65:58 - see we will see but I would if I were uh
66:03 - you know somebody getting into code
66:04 - right now the last thing I would be
66:05 - doing is listening to what you know
66:08 - Jensen hang
66:10 - the founder yeah telling people you
66:12 - don't need to learn code anymore yeah
66:15 - right I I don't know any senior
66:17 - developers who are getting work done who
66:19 - many of whom use tools like co-pilot or
66:22 - have probably tried Devon uh that that
66:25 - that way like it's just interestingly
66:28 - it's just the people selling the the
66:30 - software that is supposed to be able to
66:32 - replace developers or people selling the
66:34 - hardware that it's supposed to be able
66:35 - to build you know train the models that
66:37 - are going to replace the software
66:39 - developers that are talking like this
66:41 - the actual developers don't feel this
66:42 - way I mean like I would I would use it
66:44 - tomorrow if like you be you'd see me
66:47 - making courses tomorrow on it if that
66:49 - was the case and I'm not saying like
66:50 - it's not worth your time to learn
66:52 - there's definitely there there are tools
66:54 - that you can utilize and you use AI
66:56 - tools I just want to emphasize that oh
66:58 - yeah I do a lot so so one of the thing
67:01 - maybe you could talk about some of your
67:02 - tools cuz first of all you've been a a
67:04 - very aggressive and early adopter of AI
67:06 - tools you know Bo who runs the Freo cam
67:09 - Channel whom you and I talk with all the
67:10 - time he uh he uses whisper um also from
67:14 - open AI to he's working on some scripts
67:16 - to like automatically have really high
67:18 - quality captions in English and which
67:21 - then feed into YouTube's Auto
67:23 - translations so they improve the the
67:24 - quality of translations by the way if
67:26 - anybody's watching this I really wish I
67:28 - could watch this with Arabic subtitles
67:30 - you can you can just click the gear and
67:32 - it's like three or four clicks they
67:34 - really bury it switch it to English and
67:36 - then switch to uh then once you've
67:39 - switched it to English like
67:40 - autogenerated or English if there's
67:41 - captions for this then you can switch it
67:43 - again and you can do auto translate you
67:45 - can have pretty good like uh I like we
67:48 - we did Auto translate into Japanese the
67:50 - other day in Yoko on our team she was
67:51 - watching and she's like oh this is
67:52 - pretty good like this is not bad at all
67:55 - considering it's just kind of on the Fly
67:56 - translating but uh obviously we're using
67:58 - whisper for that but like you've used AI
68:01 - like voice cloning talk about some of
68:03 - the AI tools you've used yeah so I mean
68:06 - I mean I think that that's probably the
68:07 - one that sticks out the most which was
68:08 - thei the um the synthetic AI voice and
68:11 - the reason I had to do that was because
68:12 - I was losing my voice uh it's called um
68:16 - muscle tension dysphonia uh so there's
68:18 - one where it's it's like you wear it out
68:20 - the other ones it's like it's
68:21 - degenerative and so like I have like
68:24 - degenerative voice loss if I keep
68:26 - straining my voice and not utilizing it
68:28 - properly it just has to do with uh the
68:31 - predisposition of predis it's just you
68:34 - know genetics right genetics and and uh
68:36 - but anyway the point was is that there
68:37 - was a point where like I could not talk
68:40 - for like six months and I was like well
68:41 - I can't stop making courses and so I I
68:44 - literally went through like I don't know
68:46 - how many uh like voice products uh to Sy
68:50 - and even try to run my own model to make
68:52 - a synthetic voice and eventually I you
68:54 - know I I got a voice that worked but
68:56 - it's not just getting the voice it's
68:57 - getting the workflow with your
68:59 - technology because like a lot of these
69:00 - things don't make it easy to like type
69:03 - it out and then download the part of it
69:05 - and then sync it up so we had to um
69:08 - figure out the right voice that would
69:10 - sync up with our workflow and then we
69:12 - had to figure out how to um there was
69:15 - like another part was like we were
69:16 - trying to do like uh trying to figure
69:18 - out okay we have the voice can we do
69:20 - video as well because I hate it being on
69:21 - on screen right yeah I just hate I I
69:24 - found that I would I would it would take
69:25 - me like you know that like 30 second 15c
69:28 - video I make in the beginning beginning
69:29 - of the the things all day every single
69:32 - time I got a teleprompter I got
69:33 - everything it takes all day to do 30
69:35 - seconds because I'm I'm terrible at that
69:38 - well people I think most people are
69:39 - terrible at I'm terrible at it too uh
69:42 - which is one of the reasons I don't even
69:43 - like use any sort of teleprompter or
69:45 - anything like that like for the intros I
69:47 - just practice practice practice practice
69:49 - practice uh just to try to get it down
69:51 - to when I can do it on my sleep like the
69:53 - like the baselines I practice those I
69:55 - don't know hundreds of times before I
69:56 - attempt to perform at the beginning of
69:57 - the uh the podcast just because uh being
70:00 - able to perform on the spot there's
70:02 - always something that you're not
70:03 - completely happy with like recording
70:05 - that audio book I I wrote a book last
70:07 - year I recorded the entire thing that
70:10 - took me like two weeks of like just
70:13 - sitting there with a microphone reading
70:14 - it saying no I didn't get it right let
70:16 - me redo it and then going back and
70:18 - editing all that and it's probably twice
70:20 - as bad when you have video just because
70:22 - like maybe like I don't like the way I
70:23 - like delivered that line and I can't
70:25 - just do a nice cut because there's going
70:27 - to be jump in the video too right
70:29 - actually editing video it's obvious
70:31 - where the edits are with with sound you
70:33 - can get away with like less uh I guess
70:37 - you can do more editing with sound than
70:39 - you can with sound and video back to the
70:41 - ey like back in 2018 or whenever 2016 I
70:44 - always forget when we our company
70:45 - started but whenever we started it like
70:47 - I had an like I already had an AI bot
70:49 - that would that would analyze how
70:51 - students would study and make
70:53 - recommendations uh we stopped running
70:55 - that because we needed to rebuild it and
70:58 - the issue was once we started branching
70:59 - outside of AD bus it became you needed
71:01 - like a specialized um model per like per
71:06 - like family of certifications right so
71:09 - so we had that for a while um I'm trying
71:13 - to think uh we were trying to do like
71:14 - generate our PowerPoint slides so like
71:16 - we have a we have like a huge collection
71:18 - of uh like a huge library of slides and
71:22 - there's this huge issue of like when you
71:24 - have to update them it's like I was
71:26 - trying to make it so like it would
71:27 - generate out the code that I needed and
71:29 - just like make the slides for me and so
71:32 - you know I'm I'm not saying we're having
71:33 - 100% success with these tools but I'm
71:35 - just saying that we're constantly trying
71:36 - to experiment and try to automate our
71:38 - pipeline so we can stay as small as we
71:40 - can and we can expand me the brand
71:42 - because the hardest thing in this
71:44 - industry is getting other creators to
71:47 - create content with you at the same like
71:50 - the same standard right so like I know
71:52 - other people that make great content
71:54 - like can you make make it like me no I I
71:57 - make it my own way and I have my own
71:58 - curriculum development and I have my own
72:01 - production standards and stuff like that
72:04 - um and and then it's like even like can
72:06 - they deliver the same timeline and stuff
72:07 - like that it doesn't always line up
72:09 - right so it's so hard um and you can be
72:12 - dumping money at people and they still
72:14 - they still like ah they get 75% of the
72:15 - way they're like ah it's not for me do
72:17 - you know what I mean so it's this is
72:19 - this it's very hard you wouldn't think
72:21 - it is but it's very hard to have some of
72:24 - the skill sets
72:25 - and the stuff to do this and so you know
72:27 - I we made the determination that we're
72:28 - just going to scale me virtually um it's
72:31 - not to say like where we're we're
72:33 - tricking people because it's still me
72:35 - it's just like if I can't use my voice
72:38 - you wrote every word that is being said
72:40 - it's just that you know you you don't
72:44 - necessarily have the voice to be able to
72:47 - say and you don't want to spend like an
72:48 - entire day in front of a teleprompter
72:51 - starting over reading you know but you
72:53 - know what it's like my my AI voice it
72:55 - you can tell it's not me because I'm I'm
72:57 - not stumbling or I'm not going ums or
72:59 - stuff like that and so people people
73:02 - like I I would say they're getting so
73:05 - good I think I have to generate a new
73:06 - voice because there's a newer model that
73:07 - is even more realistic like you would
73:10 - not you would not know that it was me
73:12 - like my older one sound like I have like
73:14 - a mild cold but like nobody complained
73:16 - um and I'm not like and I would intermix
73:18 - I would shoot videos like where it seems
73:21 - like a little more livelier because now
73:22 - I'm in the video right so like if
73:23 - there's some really important stuff
73:24 - you'll you'll hear me but depends on the
73:26 - course but you know most most of the
73:28 - time it's me um but there are there are
73:30 - some courses that are um like we just
73:33 - want to fill in our catalog we want to
73:34 - get the content out and it's content
73:35 - that would never get made if it wasn't
73:36 - for voice because it's just like I don't
73:39 - I can't I can't give my voice to that
73:41 - stuff so I wouldn't I just again I don't
73:43 - feel like I'm cheating people but I
73:45 - noticed like YouTube was saying recently
73:46 - that and I think we talked about this
73:48 - earli when I first started doing I said
73:49 - like hey I should label saying this is a
73:51 - synthetic voice because eventually
73:53 - they're going to ask people to to do
73:55 - that and yeah we we had a discussion
73:57 - with with YouTube's you know
73:59 - team yeah last week about this like we
74:02 - don't believe that we should have to
74:04 - label things that are just you know
74:07 - humans that that are actual creators
74:09 - doing I think like obviously if I'm
74:11 - trying to pretend that I'm some
74:12 - celebrity and like putting words in
74:14 - their mouth that should be labeled just
74:16 - like you know this contains like AI you
74:18 - know generated speech or something but I
74:20 - don't think if if I'm using AI which
74:22 - I've never used it but I will I will say
74:25 - real quick very excited about this
74:27 - there's going to be a voice cloning um
74:31 - course that we're publishing ly Lyn Jung
74:34 - on our team who's created like the
74:35 - stable diffusion course and some other
74:36 - things she has taken my uh the Corpus of
74:40 - audio from me reading my audio book and
74:43 - she's created a really good voice model
74:44 - that and I can speak like German I I
74:47 - can't speak a word of German but you can
74:49 - hear Quincy speak you know Flawless
74:51 - German are are you saying that they
74:52 - could TR they could do translation with
74:54 - my ality and another yeah they can like
74:56 - wrap they the way it works is they build
74:59 - the model and then they kind of like
75:00 - wrap it around like some recorded speech
75:03 - so if there's like a weather report they
75:05 - can basically just have me say with the
75:07 - same intonation and every but it's my
75:09 - voice instead of you know the the
75:11 - weather lady's voice I've been trying to
75:14 - get somebody like I I've been trying to
75:17 - just so many times trying to get people
75:19 - to make like a Spanish version of my or
75:21 - something and and I'll I'll hand them
75:23 - all the material and they're like yes I
75:24 - want to do this whatever we'll even pay
75:26 - them can't get done no matter what ly
75:29 - could help you with that because we have
75:30 - a Spanish free Cod Camp Channel we could
75:32 - definitely publish some of your shirts
75:34 - in Spanish now generally like people
75:38 - like to learn from somebody who speaks
75:39 - their language whose culture but they're
75:41 - never making it so what's you know what
75:43 - I'm saying like it's true I mean long
75:45 - time it's a matter it's not a matter of
75:47 - like I wouldn't give it to somebody else
75:48 - it's like like look at my boot camp it
75:50 - was 100 hours who's going to translate
75:52 - that who nobody nobody you're right
75:55 - there is some work that just has to be
75:57 - done by machines just because humans
76:00 - ain't got time for that right well and
76:03 - you know like originally like I was
76:04 - going to I was going to learn Spanish
76:06 - like I I used to live in Spain so I had
76:08 - some some level of Competency in Spanish
76:10 - and so I was going to go and brush it up
76:12 - and everyone's like oh no no don't do
76:13 - that and I was like but why not no no
76:15 - one will do it for me and they're like
76:17 - no you should get a Spanish person like
76:19 - but no Spanish person will do it for me
76:20 - even though they say they will even with
76:22 - money no matter what so it's just kind
76:24 - of like like um but uh I don't know is
76:27 - hard to find well I mean it's it's just
76:29 - it it's it's just hard um and uh you
76:33 - know I don't know it's it's just hard I
76:35 - mean it's the work is hard like it's not
76:37 - it's not like you being a a mean person
76:39 - whatever it's just like this this role
76:41 - of conton creation is a grind and people
76:43 - do not realize that you get 90% done and
76:46 - then there's 90% more to do and then
76:48 - there's 90% more to do and then there's
76:50 - 90% packaging and then 90% uh marketing
76:53 - and you just feel you just want to be
76:56 - done and over with it and quit every
76:58 - time every course I mean what are we
77:00 - trying to do we're trying to take your
77:02 - expertise your knowledge of cloud
77:05 - computing of the certifications having
77:07 - gone drilled prepared past them or
77:10 - intentionally failed them and uh like
77:13 - like that lived experience that that
77:15 - knowledge that's in your head and break
77:17 - it out into hundreds of PowerPoint
77:19 - slides and walk through all the concepts
77:21 - walk through all the terminology walk
77:24 - through all the ways that like a certain
77:26 - type of technology is slightly different
77:28 - from others find the parallels like I
77:30 - mean your courses the the certification
77:32 - Prep course they could be like a dozen
77:34 - hours of just for one certification
77:37 - right um we just want that expertise and
77:40 - we want everybody will to have that so
77:41 - they can go past this these exams they
77:44 - can earn these certifications they can
77:45 - go out and win in the job market and
77:47 - they can uh get better jobs have more
77:50 - opportunity than they would have had
77:51 - without these certifications right like
77:53 - it's all a means to an end and that end
77:56 - is having families that can afford to
77:59 - put bread on the table Yeah so but um uh
78:03 - back to AI like AI generation for like
78:05 - like I like to use little icons to sprw
78:07 - stuff up so it's like instead of going
78:09 - to Flat icon I can just be like hey give
78:11 - me an SVG icon of something unique and
78:13 - so uh I think that that removes some of
78:16 - some of some of those things before you
78:18 - had to purchase those assets um AI
78:21 - grading so we we built out validators
78:23 - originally with the intent to have it AI
78:25 - graded um because when you are trying to
78:27 - evaluate whether people are doing doing
78:29 - work it's basically just pull apis that
78:32 - bring back Json and say does it look
78:34 - like they set this thing up right and AI
78:37 - could do that but the problem was is
78:38 - that uh the token the token window
78:41 - wasn't large enough to analyze window
78:43 - context window sure it might be now but
78:45 - I'd have to go back to it and so it
78:46 - depends on the the model but like I
78:48 - think like GPT 4 Turbo has like a much
78:52 - larger contact windso CLA has like a
78:55 - really large context window um you can
78:58 - fit like an entire code base into that
79:00 - but you know but even still was like we
79:02 - ended up just having and I just thought
79:04 - about it more I was just like it wasn't
79:06 - hard to write Jason
79:08 - validators that said okay did this show
79:10 - up in the code and so we do have like
79:13 - that was one of the outcomes of the boot
79:14 - camps was like we now have validators
79:16 - for everything almost um which is
79:18 - exciting um but anyway yeah that was
79:20 - another another uh example of uh
79:23 - validation but when we did the boot camp
79:26 - uh we did we're talking about the AWS
79:28 - boot camp the big one tell us just like
79:30 - for people who've never heard about this
79:32 - AWS boot camp it's like 95 hour video or
79:34 - something like that maybe more than 100
79:35 - hours so like it was a 100 hour video
79:38 - but like there was more to it than that
79:40 - like people went okay I can finish this
79:42 - in 100 hours and said no no no no no no
79:44 - you don't understand this was done over
79:46 - the scope of four to five months so yes
79:49 - you're watching the videos but like
79:50 - whatever you're watching it's three
79:52 - times the labor so like you're putting
79:54 - like 300 400 hours of working in fact
79:56 - today I actually have to do this later
79:58 - but there's somebody that just said hey
80:00 - I wasn't part of the boot camp when it
80:01 - ran but I just finished it all 100%
80:04 - Andrew can you please go grade me and
80:06 - Mark it over even though I'm outside of
80:07 - it and they did all the work so I'm
80:08 - going to go after this call I'm going to
80:09 - go um uh even though it's out of scope
80:12 - I'm going to go I'm going to go that's
80:13 - really chill so you you actually look at
80:15 - their work and it so there are actual
80:18 - deliverables there are projects this is
80:19 - Project oriented learning right so so
80:22 - for that one what I wanted to do was I
80:24 - wanted to uh uh if anybody got to a
80:27 - certain checkpoint I would grade them so
80:29 - we had I think it was like what was it
80:31 - I'm going to go look at the website for
80:33 - the signups since I forget it'll it'll
80:35 - come back to me for Aus Cloud project
80:36 - boot camp adus cloudro bootcamp.com uh
80:41 - we had 10,000 students enrolled but we
80:43 - actually had a list of 50,000
80:45 - backlogged 50,000 people who wanted the
80:48 - ticket who couldn't take it just because
80:50 - we had to you didn't have the manpower
80:51 - to capacity there was actually there was
80:53 - a reason for it and it had had to do I
80:55 - think with what was the there was a
80:56 - capacity limit at exactly 10,000 oh so
80:59 - like originally what we were going to do
81:01 - is we were going to see if we could have
81:03 - everyone in sandbox accounts and there
81:05 - was like a hard limit of 10,000 is what
81:07 - we determined based on something like at
81:08 - dat bu or something there was some kind
81:10 - of metric I can't remember what it was
81:11 - but there was there was a hard limit of
81:12 - 10,000 we we didn't end up using that
81:14 - system we we did Manual grading so what
81:16 - I found was that every single week we
81:18 - had people that dropped off because um
81:21 - it's hard to do something for that
81:22 - period of time at that level complexity
81:25 - and that's actually just normal for um
81:28 - for uh for Education you always expect
81:30 - to lose 40% per week yeah that's a
81:33 - guarantee me it's like even the best
81:35 - courses of all time on like corsera like
81:39 - uh Stanford's own like course platform
81:42 - have like two 3% completion rate you
81:44 - know free C Camp has a very low
81:46 - completion rate frankly a lot of people
81:48 - uh their eyes are bigger than their
81:50 - stomachs when it comes to doing hundreds
81:51 - of hours of or they or they get to where
81:54 - they need to get to right like it's not
81:56 - necessarily it's it's just like right
81:59 - it's like working out it's like you get
82:00 - you get some kind of level of skill but
82:02 - anyway like when you do it for that long
82:04 - um it will down from like from 10,000 to
82:07 - um I'd say a thousand near completion
82:10 - with a 100 core people that like really
82:13 - finished it yeah and so um that was fine
82:16 - like that was actually good numbers uh
82:18 - for for what it was and you know like
82:21 - when you say how you going to grade
82:22 - 10,000 people I didn't have to grade
82:24 - 10,000 people I had to grade um thousand
82:26 - people and then 100 people really well
82:29 - yeah right um and I really enjoyed it I
82:32 - got really fat even though I had lost a
82:33 - lot of weight I lost a lot of weight
82:34 - again I'm losing weight right now again
82:36 - just because stress of like grading all
82:38 - these
82:39 - people uh no no no no no no no it's just
82:42 - I no it's just um but anyway it's just
82:45 - well I mean you said you got really fat
82:46 - what do you mean I well because I was
82:48 - here like right now I'm in standing but
82:50 - like I was
82:51 - sitting all day every day taking calls
82:54 - every single day I didn't have time to
82:57 - prepare good meal good meals because I
82:58 - was like we were making it we were we
83:01 - made the course like I sorry I made the
83:03 - I we were making a product like a um a
83:05 - social media platform I clone of Twitter
83:07 - right and I didn't plan it ahead it
83:10 - wasn't like I it was all stage it was
83:12 - like we're building something for real
83:14 - and we'll we'll have class this week and
83:16 - then throughout the week I have to make
83:18 - it right so it was like we had a general
83:21 - idea what we wanted to build but it was
83:22 - it was um we say build the
83:24 - as we cross it uh and it led to a very
83:27 - unique experience that I don't know if I
83:29 - could replicate again because uh I
83:31 - didn't make any money off of it not that
83:33 - so how much did the boot camp cost to
83:35 - attend uh nothing it was free it was
83:38 - 100% free for for for students like not
83:41 - free for me not free for you did you
83:43 - have sponsors how did you make it work
83:45 - uh we sorry we had a couple sponsors so
83:47 - we had uh like a we cloud data which is
83:49 - a um a school in Toronto they're like
83:52 - super nice Adrian krill who's my
83:55 - competitor SP sponsored me he was very
83:58 - generous um you wouldn't think that he
84:00 - would sponsor maybe he's trying to push
84:01 - you in an early grave overing you yeah
84:05 - right he's oh no he's go for do a lot of
84:08 - these no he's a good guy's he's like
84:10 - he's just jokeing I'm sure he's a good
84:12 - guy I just but um um I thought we had
84:15 - another sponsor but yeah it was like
84:17 - there was no it was at the time where
84:18 - all these layoffs were happening so
84:20 - people said they said Andrew you're
84:22 - going to have the easiest time getting
84:23 - sponsors and then all of a sudden
84:25 - everyone's like we can't get sponsorship
84:27 - for anything yeah like there like like
84:29 - there's there's events where people have
84:31 - like 500 people and they'll they'll get
84:32 - like
84:34 - $200,000 in sponsorship and I I I had
84:37 - sponsorship like 20 30 and and and and
84:41 - we we like we out of pocket our company
84:43 - xam Pro was like
84:45 - $70,000 right so it wasn't like it was
84:47 - free it cost me money and uh you know we
84:51 - we kind of made it up when we did the
84:52 - terraform boot camp so we had to do a
84:53 - hybrid thing with the terraform boot
84:55 - camp and it kind of It kind of
84:56 - alleviated that but really like this
84:58 - cost of the booth Camp came from me
85:01 - making all the courses the free courses
85:03 - that we published at free Cod camp and
85:05 - people optionally paying for the
85:07 - additional materials which they don't
85:08 - need to pass let's talk about exam Pro's
85:11 - business model I I definitely want to
85:13 - talk about uh you know your terraform uh
85:17 - boot camp and things like and you use
85:18 - the term boot camp a lot of people think
85:20 - coding boot camp like boot camps have
85:22 - actually existed I think back since
85:24 - since the bubble like it's it's
85:26 - considered a newer phenomenon but the
85:28 - idea of basically having like something
85:31 - quick to quickly help somebody acclimate
85:33 - to a new field a new category of skills
85:35 - that they're trying to acquire right uh
85:38 - so a boot camp doesn't necessarily need
85:39 - to be like oh I paid $20,000 and I study
85:42 - for 16 weeks or something like that
85:44 - that's like what it was during the the
85:45 - height of the boot camp craze and like
85:48 - 2014 20 through 2018 maybe that's about
85:51 - right yeah between that but like examp
85:54 - Pro you
85:57 - publish you know huge video courses uh
86:00 - on fre Cod Camp dozens of them on pretty
86:03 - much every cloud certification you can
86:05 - imagine like entire ecosystems like all
86:08 - the AWS you know categories of
86:10 - certifications and it makes people mad
86:12 - too like other conon creators it makes
86:14 - them mad because that they they say um
86:16 - it's not that problem anymore but at one
86:18 - point that uh Conor creators believed
86:20 - that I was um uh uh running running
86:24 - everything to the ground because if if I
86:26 - release the videos for free then who's
86:29 - going to buy a paid course that's just
86:31 - videos you have to do something
86:32 - additional to it and it turns out people
86:33 - will still pay for people love spending
86:36 - money like people still use udemy and
86:39 - and pay $25 for a course that they're
86:42 - never going to actually watch because it
86:43 - feels good to buy to walk into a
86:46 - bookstore and buy a book because it
86:47 - feels like you're buying the time to
86:48 - actually read that book people people
86:51 - people love to like Express their
86:52 - intentions and their aspirations through
86:54 - purchasing well it's like a hot dog too
86:56 - right
86:57 - like like you want ketchup mustard and
87:00 - relish on and and different people bring
87:02 - different perspectives right so there's
87:04 - there's room for more than like people
87:05 - think like I'm worried about other
87:07 - competitors it depends like if if
87:09 - somebody's trying to do exactly the same
87:11 - thing in the exact funnel at the exact
87:13 - time as me that's a problem but if we
87:15 - were friends and we coordinate and they
87:16 - going and this lot people don't know
87:18 - this like a lot of the creators in the
87:19 - space were all F like a lot of us are
87:21 - friends some of us were very
87:23 - antagonistic early on it was very
87:25 - problematic but a lot of us like we like
87:28 - we get out of the way of each other
87:29 - right so that we we both can do well and
87:33 - be we're technical competitors but we
87:34 - can we can both do well and uh it's
87:37 - usually an issue when there's just like
87:38 - there's some people that are just like
87:39 - they're just they just want to yeah make
87:41 - the most and do everything right and I I
87:43 - look like that because I do a bit of
87:45 - everything but I don't really cause that
87:48 - much damage in in these areas if a lot
87:50 - of you doing everything is just because
87:52 - you're intellectually very curious and
87:53 - you love learning about these new
87:55 - technologies and taking these exams like
87:57 - you're like an exam nerd or like
88:00 - certification nerd in the way that like
88:02 - daal Shaw who runs class Central is
88:05 - obsessed with massive open online
88:07 - courses from like Stanford and MIT and
88:08 - stuff like he he sleeps and breathes
88:11 - this he goes to conferences where he
88:13 - just talks he's just giddily excited
88:15 - about this and you give me the same Vibe
88:17 - as far as technical certifications um so
88:21 - one thing one question I have for you
88:23 - the way exam Pro works the way that
88:25 - you're able to publish all this content
88:27 - for free on YouTube on the free Cod Camp
88:31 - Channel and still you know buy expensive
88:34 - bread to give to your kids uh and put
88:37 - gas in your car for a two-hour road trip
88:39 - every time you want to get groceries um
88:41 - like like how does exam Pro actually
88:43 - work like what kind of additional things
88:45 - can people buy on exam pro. we like the
88:48 - idea is that we believe that there
88:50 - should be a base level that's free like
88:52 - the videos so that even if you can't
88:54 - afford anything you can pass right you
88:57 - should you should be able to fill the
88:58 - gaps yourself so everything is is like
89:00 - it's it's almost kind of like the the
89:03 - Cosmetics of of DLCs and video games or
89:06 - I shouldn't say that're they're more
89:07 - useful than that but it's like um it
89:09 - would be like we always give a free
89:11 - practice exam so that's our our trick to
89:13 - get you to come to the platform is like
89:15 - we live we always say come to the
89:16 - platform get the free practice exam you
89:18 - go there and then we have downloadable
89:21 - the these are the pain things
89:22 - downloadable slides downloadable cheat
89:24 - sheets um better better digestible
89:28 - content because we put it on freeo Camp
89:29 - as the big video and that's intentional
89:32 - because we want to create a like just a
89:34 - little bit of friction and if you go to
89:36 - our platform you can watch the videos
89:37 - individualize yeah and you can actually
89:39 - there's like a pretty cool like workflow
89:41 - where you like click through and
89:42 - everything's broken out into different
89:44 - like if if if anybody's ever taken a
89:46 - course on like um educative or class
89:51 - classify or something I can't remember
89:52 - the names of these different
89:54 - platforms but they're they're basically
89:56 - like you can just pay a fee to like have
89:59 - this and you can put your site on that
90:00 - but you have all custom and it's much
90:02 - better than those in my experience
90:04 - because you've like gone through and
90:06 - like engineered everything so you you
90:09 - you progress through the different
90:10 - things and you get like stars moving
90:12 - across if I if I recall correctly yep
90:15 - yep yeah so it's it's like a an
90:17 - incredibly wholesome like productive
90:19 - learning environment for people who have
90:22 - a very clear goal I want to pass the
90:25 - AWS uh whatever certified Cloud
90:27 - practitioner or the devops one of the
90:29 - harder ones right which whatever is the
90:30 - yeah whatever of the nine or 12
90:34 - whichever certifications so maybe you
90:35 - talk about like the the pricing and like
90:37 - how much it costs obviously this is not
90:39 - an ad for exam Pro but I'm actually I'm
90:41 - just curious about these things because
90:43 - I I want for creators to be able to
90:47 - survive and and provide foran this is
90:49 - more just like this is more just
90:51 - information for other creators if you're
90:52 - just wondering how how the the to watch
90:54 - model works and maybe you want to do
90:55 - something similar and go on free C Camp
90:57 - and make think like how do how can I
90:59 - make free content but also make money
91:01 - yeah right because like we're not
91:03 - colluding here or or doing anything
91:05 - crazy here with free C Camp anybody can
91:06 - do it um yeah I mean we're very
91:08 - selective about whom we'll publish on
91:10 - free Cod camp but once you get past that
91:13 - yes if you are somebody who is good at
91:15 - what you do know a lot about what you do
91:18 - and want to create a course on some
91:19 - esoteric technology uh like cold fusion
91:23 - or uh or whatever right like four TR
91:25 - we've got a Fortran course or we we got
91:27 - a cobal course we don't have a four Tran
91:29 - course if anybody wants to create one if
91:31 - you're like some old guard you know uh
91:33 - Mainframe person and you you want to
91:36 - create a course on that as long as
91:37 - you're good at teaching yeah we're we're
91:39 - down you and I think the thing is just
91:42 - like finding a means to for we can make
91:44 - more videos right because it's just it's
91:46 - it's a silic but like right now it like
91:48 - looks like our prices are 29 USD I don't
91:50 - control the pricing that's all that's
91:51 - for like one certification like basic
91:54 - it's it's not a monthly recurring is
91:56 - there no we don't do subscriptions we
91:58 - don't believe in I mean maybe one day
91:59 - we'll have them but like I like people
92:01 - don't like them because they get charged
92:04 - when they don't want something yeah
92:06 - right so like maybe eventually we'll
92:08 - introduce a subscription but like we'd
92:10 - make sure that you can opt out of it and
92:12 - I there's other competitors in the space
92:15 - um that like I I was recommending but
92:17 - then when I sent up their
92:19 - platforms their content there was
92:21 - description then you still have to pay
92:23 - more and then like it was so hard to
92:25 - unsubscribe I really didn't like it like
92:27 - it was in Cloud space in particular and
92:29 - like I I L I literally yelled at them on
92:30 - Twitter because I wanted my money back
92:33 - because I was trying to recommend them
92:34 - because they had Labs like like lab
92:36 - systems I didn't have I don't care if
92:37 - people need education I want to
92:38 - recommend them to other places and so
92:40 - these are obviously ways to grow your
92:42 - organization and so you know we
92:43 - fundamentally thought okay we're just
92:44 - going to charge a single time fee it
92:47 - does expire after 3 years but we assume
92:48 - like the content will be expired by then
92:50 - anyway and also you should do it by then
92:54 - yeah it's like a little little uh carrot
92:57 - like you only have two years 11 month
93:00 - whatever it is a year two years again I
93:02 - don't know what I don't what the
93:03 - parameters are if it's a year or three
93:04 - years but it's the certifications are
93:06 - constantly getting refreshed like yeah
93:08 - and if people come to us we're pretty
93:09 - good about like oh I you know I want I I
93:12 - was just getting back into like fine
93:13 - here you go we'll just we're pretty like
93:15 - even people steal our content we're
93:16 - pretty uh lazy fair about it like cuz we
93:19 - like again everything's soft gated so
93:22 - it's like you know like don't don't if
93:24 - you're listening don't take you know
93:26 - Andrew's hard work and put it on bitor
93:28 - or something like that like you know 30
93:30 - bucks depending on where you live do you
93:32 - have any sort of need-based scholarships
93:34 - or anything like that for uh people that
93:36 - are like in lower income countries have
93:38 - you ever experimented with like
93:39 - purchasing power priority we were we
93:41 - were trying to like it has to do with
93:43 - the payment Gateway right and so we were
93:45 - trying really hard to switch our payment
93:47 - Gateway and we spent like four or five
93:49 - months doing this and it just like the
93:51 - technology is just still really hard to
93:54 - get implemented
93:55 - so I don't know this is like this again
93:57 - this is why we're so relaxed about it
93:59 - but like you know I've seen people and
94:00 - they're like in West Africa they're you
94:03 - know like they're dealing with like
94:04 - constant power outages and they can't
94:06 - spend $10 outside outside their org
94:09 - right like or or their or their country
94:11 - not their their country is not an
94:12 - organization they're uh maybe one day
94:15 - but anyway anyway hopefully hopefully
94:18 - the countries remain nation
94:20 - states corporations that would be very
94:22 - uh that'd be very
94:25 - yeah but um but you know I would just
94:26 - say like I've seen people they take like
94:28 - screenshots of every single thing and
94:30 - made their own like downloadable slides
94:32 - and stuff like that but like I think
94:33 - that we're like we have a full free
94:35 - practice exam and all the contents there
94:37 - so like you wanted to go take
94:38 - screenshots of all the things so you
94:39 - have the slides so you can review them I
94:41 - don't care but it's it's another thing
94:43 - if you're uploading them to to torrent
94:45 - sites right that's that's another story
94:46 - like because you're optimizing for other
94:48 - people right so again I'm like there's
94:50 - people that go and they like they'll
94:52 - take videos and they're likey Andrew can
94:53 - I go record one of your practice exams
94:55 - on YouTube and review them I go sure I
94:57 - don't care do you know what I mean like
94:59 - I'm like I'm that relaxed about it
95:00 - because you know I I I know there's
95:03 - enough there that people are generally
95:04 - going to pay for it you know what I mean
95:06 - and the people that I I don't feel like
95:09 - like I've seen other people they've
95:09 - taken my content and they made free
95:11 - ebooks out of them yeah that is kind of
95:14 - like sketchy though when they're like
95:15 - literally selling stolen content I think
95:17 - that they weren't they weren't selling
95:18 - it they just were they're just they just
95:20 - were studying and they they uh they
95:22 - enriched it and put it in a format to
95:24 - the point where it's like I almost
95:25 - wanted to pay them so that we could put
95:26 - it on the marketplace which just never
95:27 - did yeah um and so I just went and they
95:30 - they were pretty transparent about they
95:31 - like yeah I did this and that and I went
95:33 - oh okay other companies would sue sue
95:35 - sue you out the nose but like for me I
95:38 - was just kind of like you know what I
95:40 - mean because if we're still making like
95:43 - I'm still if I can still afford things I
95:45 - don't care so much it's like people
95:46 - pirating video games like you know you
95:48 - heard about Nintendo uh and and the the
95:51 - tears of the Kingdom I've never played
95:52 - it but like the that one where they're
95:54 - going after um the uh the emulator for
95:59 - Nintendo like Nintendo switch because
96:01 - they're worried about it and so I'm very
96:03 - I'm very relaxed about it so until it
96:05 - actually impacts me I'm I'm pretty much
96:07 - yeah yeah you definitely don't like
96:09 - Nintendo has kind of like really damaged
96:12 - their reputation with Indie developers
96:14 - by being overly litigious and you don't
96:16 - want to do that you want to create like
96:18 - an ecosystem of people who are excited
96:19 - about exam Pro and recommend it and you
96:23 - don't want to have like a an iron fist
96:26 - as far as people um trying to use your
96:28 - tools right so but yeah camp like that's
96:32 - all built into our you know very
96:36 - permissive open source license you know
96:38 - people can take the free Camp PL it's by
96:40 - Design but when you're actually creating
96:42 - stuff that's not open source that you're
96:44 - trying to sell there's probably a lot
96:46 - more judgment involed I mean it's more
96:48 - like it's the issue is more like when we
96:49 - have schools that take it and they use
96:51 - and they do do this there's been schools
96:53 - the states and the UK not even like it's
96:56 - not like weird it's not like say I
96:59 - shouldn't say the word weird I just mean
97:00 - like countries where uh they're
97:02 - developing countries and they have a a
97:06 - inaccessibility to content I have no
97:08 - issues with them these are organizations
97:10 - that are all about making money they're
97:11 - in the US and the UK and they take my
97:13 - content they use in the curriculum um
97:16 - and they try to find ways around it so
97:17 - for instance they're taking the free
97:18 - Camp content and uh there's internal
97:21 - students there saying hey this is
97:22 - Andrew's content do you pay them or
97:24 - anything cuz they're paying like
97:26 - thousands of like like 7 to 7,000 to
97:29 - $10,000 to veterans veterans of the US
97:33 - at schools using the the the content
97:35 - that was published on free Co camp and
97:37 - so they they told me and I said hey you
97:39 - can't do this you like I said you should
97:41 - I said I would say like if you want to
97:43 - use this content pay a licensing fee and
97:46 - we'll even give you more to update up
97:47 - to-date content so what they did instead
97:49 - is they took they took that down and
97:51 - they found one of my older unimi courses
97:53 - cuz
97:53 - I published them on un for free which
97:55 - never worked out by the way I just
97:56 - forgot about them and so they started
97:58 - using cont from like six seven years ago
98:00 - they're like well it's unies thing like
98:03 - and I was like are you kidding me and
98:05 - and these are accredited schools and so
98:06 - I went to their their accrediting board
98:08 - and said hey
98:09 - look this is not they're not they don't
98:12 - know what they're doing they're just
98:13 - taking content off the internet and then
98:15 - teaching and charging 10 thousands to
98:16 - veterans that are subed by the US
98:18 - government man veterans are so exploited
98:20 - I'm sure a lot of people listening to
98:21 - this have served in the US
98:24 - uh the US military uh and other
98:27 - militaries too but like once you have
98:30 - that GI bill money and or like like
98:34 - there are so many grifters out there
98:36 - trying to separate people from their
98:39 - hard-earned money that the government
98:41 - gives them for their services uh I mean
98:43 - it's as Tail as old as time like the uh
98:45 - the M Mustang dealership uh right next
98:48 - to the uh the uh Army Recruitment Center
98:51 - and stuff like that right but but with
98:53 - with courses it's really like we want
98:56 - people to be spending that money on
98:59 - community colleges and universities and
99:01 - things like that not on you know kind of
99:03 - shoddy vocational training programs that
99:06 - are privately operated and I'm sure they
99:07 - are good programs too but it is
99:10 - definitely like it comes down to the
99:11 - indivual SCH it's frustrating when
99:13 - they're cutting Corners I mean first of
99:15 - all free Cod Camp use free Cod camps
99:17 - curricula like our actual curricula is
99:20 - totally chill to use right it's open
99:22 - source is accessible anywhere there are
99:24 - lots of organizations that run free code
99:27 - camp on a local network within like uh
99:30 - you know like prisons for example that
99:32 - don't have internet
99:34 - access shout out to
99:36 - persevere um and there are also a lot of
99:40 - uh you know computer labs in places that
99:45 - don't have good internet access which
99:47 - there are a lot of places like that in
99:48 - the US you know the the most developed
99:51 - wealthy country in the world right but
99:53 - have really bad internet coverage and a
99:56 - lot of people will take free Cod Camp
99:57 - they'll put it in like a computer lab at
99:59 - a school so people can actually like
100:01 - learn without having highp speed
100:02 - internet yeah it's a it's a different
100:04 - story when it's like people where like
100:05 - they don't have power half the time or
100:07 - they or they have a lack of access to
100:09 - Internet or it's a different story right
100:11 - but absolutely but but like we would be
100:13 - totally chill if people use free Cod
100:15 - camp in those circumstances but you know
100:18 - exampro Andrew Brown and other creators
100:20 - like please don't just wholesale take
100:22 - their material
100:23 - and and sell like free Cod Camp is
100:25 - designed where you can do that you can
100:27 - even white label free Cod camp and
100:29 - pretend it's your own coursework as long
100:30 - as you don't claim your free Cod Camp
100:32 - that's technically within the bounds of
100:34 - free Cod Camp's life for the interactive
100:36 - textual curricula which is all created
100:39 - by me and a whole bunch of other
100:41 - instructional designers and the open
100:43 - source Community but the stuff we
100:45 - publish on YouTube is like everything
100:47 - you publish on YouTube even though we're
100:49 - publishing it it's still technically
100:51 - copyright Andrew Brown and exam Pro
100:53 - right and and we want to always make
100:55 - sure that those copyrights are respected
100:58 - by everyone so sorry
101:00 - I'm it's hard to enforce copyright but
101:03 - it's just it's just about being
101:04 - respectful a lot of times creators like
101:06 - I'm a very flexible Creator and and my
101:08 - you know my attitude is like I'm just
101:09 - here to help people so when the inis
101:11 - boot camp one the uh the women cyber
101:13 - security had had adapted that and used
101:16 - it to teach a cloud for people that are
101:17 - getting cyber security I didn't ask for
101:20 - any money I just said oh great you're
101:21 - going to help more women get into cyber
101:23 - security you need a cloud basis here you
101:25 - go like I just need to understand the
101:27 - nature of they weren't trying to do this
101:28 - surreptitiously they no no I like
101:32 - sometimes people do things that they
101:33 - don't ask permission but it sometimes
101:34 - it's not an issue with me it's just like
101:36 - it really has to do it's like are you
101:38 - trying to charge some do you not have
101:40 - the expertise are you trying to charge
101:42 - someone
101:43 - $10,000 you know what I mean like for
101:45 - some and it has no outcome for them and
101:48 - do they even know that it's the
101:49 - content's coming for me are you are you
101:51 - misrepresenting the content so like my
101:54 - my goal is like I if I could and like if
101:57 - I wasn't a for-profit company like I I
101:59 - mean I wish I was a nonprofit company
102:00 - there just nonprofits are
102:02 - uh it's hard it's hard it's hard I know
102:05 - it's hard it's hard right and it's un
102:07 - like I'm just not in a place where it's
102:09 - like if I my house was paid off if I if
102:11 - I if I I didn't have debts a house and I
102:14 - was like a little bit a little bit
102:15 - better off I would be a nonprofit and my
102:19 - my whole curriculum would be even more
102:21 - transparently open course I'd make it an
102:23 - open book and I would be trying to push
102:24 - it onto places so that they there was a
102:27 - base level of that stuff so we need
102:29 - people who have these skills and and
102:32 - speaking of that like obviously we've
102:33 - been talking a lot about like the
102:34 - Creator economy and like the realities
102:37 - of creating content getting it out the
102:39 - distribution channel that is like
102:41 - YouTube uh the distribution channel that
102:43 - is like you know free Cod Camp if you
102:45 - want to look at it that way like I have
102:46 - an email newsletter that has 7 million
102:48 - recipients each week that is a way that
102:51 - I can help share the work of Andrew
102:53 - Brown and help more people prepare for
102:56 - and earn these certifications for
102:57 - example but like beyond that kind of
103:00 - like Creator related stuff and I'm sure
103:02 - there are a lot of creators listening in
103:04 - the audience for whom this is really
103:05 - excited about I want to get to the real
103:08 - um the real powerful unlock for
103:11 - everybody listening and that is talking
103:13 - about certifications and for people who
103:16 - want to earn certifications how they
103:18 - should focus their time so my first
103:20 - question for you
103:24 - if I'm a developer in 2024 maybe I've
103:26 - completed a few of the free C Camp
103:28 - certifications which are free that you
103:30 - can just earn by you know completing the
103:32 - projects and everything like that and I
103:33 - want to earn some professional
103:36 - certifications from big companies like
103:38 - Amazon or Microsoft where do I start
103:40 - what would you recommend for a basket of
103:44 - certifications that people should focus
103:46 - on if they just want to have the
103:47 - broadest opportunity possible before
103:50 - they really want to specialize before
103:52 - you get to certific if you should have a
103:54 - base knowledge of technical skills and
103:56 - so some uh what what free Camp delivers
104:00 - with their uh their free certifications
104:02 - the ones that you provide in different
104:04 - technologies will give you a basis of it
104:06 - if you don't have programming skills if
104:07 - you don't have networking skills if you
104:09 - don't have uh any like OS skills Linux
104:12 - skills you you will pass Cloud
104:14 - certifications but you won't be able to
104:16 - do anything when we did our itus boot
104:18 - camp we had people that held Pros
104:20 - Specialties all the highest level
104:22 - clusters notifications they couldn't use
104:26 - Discord they couldn't use a g like a
104:30 - GitHub account they could not write code
104:32 - they could not make diagrams they could
104:34 - not build anything they could not
104:36 - communicate properly and so what I'm
104:38 - saying to you is that CLA
104:42 - certifications require a another level
104:44 - of Base skills that you either have to
104:46 - do prior or during and so when I make my
104:49 - cloud courses I throw in a bunch of
104:52 - stuff in there that is not part of the
104:55 - certification okay and it will take
104:58 - longer to do and it'll be be annoying
104:59 - and it'll it'll take longer to get your
105:01 - goal but you have to have these skills
105:03 - and so you either want to obtain those
105:05 - skills first before you do it now let's
105:07 - talk about certifications certification
105:09 - like Cloud certifications I I think the
105:11 - the approach that is better is to go
105:13 - broad before you go deep okay so uh if
105:17 - you ask everybody else they'll always
105:19 - say go deep into like just pick a cloud
105:21 - and go deep into that yeah and and the
105:23 - reason I I say no is because every
105:25 - single cloud has their biased has their
105:28 - gaps and um they just won't have good
105:31 - coverage of the landscape of of stuff
105:33 - you need to learn and and you basically
105:35 - do need to learn it all not all at once
105:37 - but you need to learn it you need you
105:38 - need to learn it so um Microsoft has a
105:41 - very good approach where they have a
105:42 - bunch of fundamental certifications so
105:44 - they have their fundamentals which is
105:46 - just general Cloud then they have their
105:48 - data fundamentals their AI fundamentals
105:51 - their security fundamentals and there's
105:54 - probably another one and so that is a
105:56 - great approach because you're getting
105:58 - across uh across the board good coverage
106:02 - of your stuff and then when you have
106:03 - that then you can go deeper on another
106:05 - cloud and if you go into ads ads uh um
106:08 - their Cloud certification is it doesn't
106:10 - have enough coverage so you could do ad
106:12 - of us and then do all the other
106:13 - fundamentals that Microsoft has the only
106:15 - disadvantage of doing the Microsoft ones
106:16 - is that they're they're all focused
106:18 - specifically on their products so now
106:20 - you have to go to other clouds to to
106:22 - fill those gaps and I want to talk about
106:24 - like how those gaps are different if you
106:26 - are on the Microsoft
106:27 - platform um active directory which is a
106:30 - huge staple of the of the tech industry
106:33 - is extremely well covered on their
106:36 - platform okay you go to AWS it's like it
106:39 - doesn't exist you go to gcp it's like it
106:41 - doesn't exist and so that's like one big
106:44 - gap that you will have if you use if
106:46 - you're ons and you learn about servess
106:49 - Technologies they're first class over
106:51 - there they work excellent they're
106:53 - they're just so well interconnected you
106:54 - over to Azure Microsoft Azure and they
106:57 - are just not the same thing whatsoever
107:00 - like you don't use Azure functions to
107:02 - build apps with it you use it to execute
107:04 - like background jobs for integrated
107:06 - services on the platform it's it's like
107:08 - a totally different different thing
107:10 - because they're so underdeveloped you go
107:11 - over to gcp and gcp just real quick
107:14 - Google
107:15 - Cloud uh Pro what is it platform Google
107:19 - Cloud platform and AWS Amazon web
107:21 - services inter that's fair that's fair
107:24 - because they're they're different yeah
107:25 - the initialization there but like gcp
107:27 - you go over there they're really good
107:29 - with data like big queries like
107:32 - unbelievably great service uh their
107:34 - their ml services are unbelievably
107:36 - unbelievably excellent um and it's just
107:40 - it's just
107:41 - like it's just they're they're
107:43 - completely different so like people say
107:45 - they're the same and they are to a
107:47 - certain degree but then they're they're
107:48 - different and they'll give you a
107:50 - different aspect of of of the industry
107:52 - right right like uh and when you when
107:54 - you work at places it's it's yes most
107:57 - use a primary cloud provider but they're
108:00 - going to have a different way of working
108:02 - so um you know like Microsoft they're
108:06 - very CLI driven like everything is like
108:10 - when you're learning is like you're
108:11 - using scripts that are pre-existing
108:13 - you're using lots of Powershell you're
108:14 - using lots of net you're using lots of
108:16 - dot Windows servers if you don't know
108:18 - that ecosystem you're going to have a
108:20 - hard time right and that's like a big
108:22 - gap as well not knowing that EOS like my
108:23 - co-founder he's really good at that
108:24 - stuff so I always I'm always pulling him
108:25 - in for that kind of stuff so I don't
108:27 - know it's just I would just say trying
108:28 - to get as much broad coverage as
108:30 - possible and that's like the opposite
108:32 - advice a lot of people say but it's
108:34 - weird because there's an older adage of
108:36 - a t-shaped developer where you go Broad
108:39 - and then you go deep but people seem to
108:42 - have forgotten that or or they're
108:44 - they're just they're they're just in
108:45 - their bubble of their bias like they're
108:47 - in their like they're in their team and
108:48 - they just want to stick with their team
108:49 - I mean I I guess if I was just like
108:51 - somebody who didn't know a lot about
108:53 - what it was like actually working in
108:55 - Tech and I was just like I'm just going
108:56 - to pick AWS and I'm going to earn every
108:58 - AWS certification got to catch them all
109:01 - and like yeah you're like going through
109:02 - you're learning uh you're using exam Pro
109:05 - to like cover the fundamentals and I'm
109:07 - I'm uh relieved to hear that like you
109:09 - cover a lot of stuff that isn't on the
109:10 - exams just because it is stuff that
109:12 - people should know that goes beyond the
109:14 - scope of the exams but like I could
109:16 - easily see someone just using the
109:18 - official docs and just trying to grind
109:20 - through and earn these certifications
109:21 - and completely not seeing the forest for
109:23 - the trees that these certifications
109:25 - cover very specific you know tools that
109:28 - are all you know it's it's like building
109:31 - a castle in the sky right without that
109:33 - Foundation there to hold everything up
109:35 - you you might as well be like there
109:37 - there's that um the Chinese room Paradox
109:41 - right it's like a machine learning thing
109:42 - like if you're in the room and you have
109:46 - like some book and people are feeding in
109:47 - these Chinese characters and you're
109:49 - looking at the book and you're you're
109:50 - figuring out what Chinese character
109:52 - follows what character and you're ping
109:53 - that out you could technically be like
109:55 - an amazing you know Chinese character
109:59 - token predictor like uh without ever
110:02 - actually knowing Chinese because you're
110:04 - just following like some instructions
110:06 - but you don't actually understand what's
110:07 - going on by learning the fundamentals
110:10 - you ascend from being a mere you know
110:13 - automaton inside of you know a a Chinese
110:16 - character
110:17 - producing room uh to actually being
110:21 - somebody who knows what they're doing
110:23 - and understands the importance of tools
110:25 - and when to use certain tools in which
110:27 - context and all this stuff you're a
110:28 - well-rounded developer you're a t-shaped
110:30 - developer right like you've got that
110:32 - breadth and then you've got that depth
110:33 - in the security space or the network
110:35 - space or whatever area you choose to
110:37 - specialize in right so so I know I'm
110:39 - just recapitulating what you said but uh
110:42 - 100% I think that uh it it is absolutely
110:45 - important to get the fundamentals okay
110:47 - well and there's other ones like that
110:48 - aren't Cloud specific like you should
110:50 - know I so like take the ter form CD as
110:53 - one you should know you should know how
110:55 - to work with uh Version Control Systems
110:58 - take the GitHub Foundation certification
111:00 - you should know how to do programming
111:02 - take the C certification right yeah free
111:05 - Camp has a a free C certification that
111:08 - we develops in partnership with
111:10 - Microsoft it uses official Microsoft
111:12 - documentation and we kind of like
111:13 - curated with them there there's ones
111:15 - there are no sort of like I don't think
111:17 - there's a SQL certification but it's
111:18 - like go take the the SQL course on free
111:21 - Camp when we did our boot camp all all
111:23 - of the
111:24 - prerequisites uh were free cam content
111:27 - it was all all all free Camp because we
111:30 - could fill all those gaps there the only
111:31 - the only challenge with like some of the
111:32 - stuff is that again it's not it's not
111:35 - it's not a problem it's just that people
111:37 - like things when they're packaged in a
111:38 - particular way so like a lot of these
111:40 - things it's like they're Great Courses
111:42 - there's like a compai course that came
111:43 - out uh like I think a recent like
111:45 - covered comsi but just like for some
111:47 - reason like if it's not packaged a
111:49 - certain way like there's not a goal post
111:50 - at the end you don't get a a paper at
111:52 - the end and and there's uh uh ways of
111:55 - checking it people kind of can discredit
111:57 - these things which which seems really
111:59 - silly to me um and so you know like it's
112:02 - not like I'm like crazy about
112:03 - certifications it's just the fact that
112:05 - it works as a mechanism to get people
112:08 - motivated um and so you know if there is
112:11 - a way to break out of that it'd be nice
112:12 - but I I don't think there is it's just
112:13 - the way humans are you got to play to to
112:16 - to how humans think yeah absolutely the
112:19 - teacher has to meet the learner halfway
112:21 - and empathize with the learner and and
112:22 - like all their circumstances if they
112:24 - want to help the learner mhm
112:28 - so just to recapitulate like like I mean
112:31 - you said if you want to learn your
112:32 - Version Control do this certification
112:34 - let's talk real quick about the GitHub
112:35 - certifications because GitHub just
112:37 - published some certifications very cool
112:39 - we've already got a few uh we've got at
112:42 - least one course by Andrew Brown on uh
112:45 - free Cod camp that covers one of these
112:48 - uh certifications the the foundational
112:50 - certification for GitHub right maybe we
112:52 - can talk maybe you could just give us
112:54 - some insight into how these
112:56 - certifications were developed how they
112:57 - were released and the interesting kind
113:01 - of sequence of events that transpired
113:02 - from there that you were personally
113:04 - involved in you know it depends on it
113:06 - depends on the certification every
113:08 - family certification uh I take a
113:10 - different approach to uh for GitHub I
113:12 - was really excited about it when I heard
113:13 - that they were releasing these
113:14 - certifications because uh my primary
113:18 - skills as a developer right some people
113:20 - from networking uh the it space
113:22 - technically I cover the it space but
113:24 - developer was it is my bread and butter
113:26 - and so GitHub I already knew inside and
113:28 - out like uh there was no question in my
113:31 - mind that I could produce a course uh
113:33 - very quickly and as soon as I saw the
113:36 - outline um I literally had every single
113:40 - course not just the GitHub foundations
113:42 - every single course broken up in terms
113:44 - of how in terms of how I would record it
113:47 - and the GitHub Foundation like included
113:49 - in like three four days in fact it would
113:51 - have been done sooner but there were uh
113:53 - some uh delays uh because uh we're
113:57 - talking about how how to release that
113:59 - course and the timing of it so so like
114:01 - it was just done instantly and it's
114:04 - because I could just literally open up
114:05 - GitHub and start recording without
114:08 - having to do any research whatsoever um
114:12 - it was it was the fastest course I ever
114:13 - I think I've ever produced like three or
114:14 - four days um but um uh the the challenge
114:18 - with that course in particular like
114:20 - people have to understand like there's
114:22 - it like when courses are engineered
114:24 - there are Legacy reasons as to why
114:25 - they're engineered so like that GitHub
114:27 - certification they existed they existed
114:30 - before this happened apparently they
114:31 - existed for like two three years they
114:32 - were used internally with Partners okay
114:34 - this this is common knowled I'm not
114:36 - giving Secrets out here this is not
114:37 - Secrets but so let's say you're like
114:40 - VMware or some other tech company and
114:42 - you're like we want to get our uh some
114:45 - of our Engineers certified on your your
114:47 - stuff like continuing professional
114:49 - education is that what they were used
114:51 - for yeah I think I think I think again
114:54 - GitHub has to be the one that really
114:55 - speaks to it but I believe that the
114:57 - purpose of it was that they had partners
114:59 - with GitHub and they were incentivized
115:02 - to get these
115:03 - certifications working in official
115:05 - capacity with GitHub and this is kind of
115:07 - like how adus does it and other ones but
115:08 - like adus has the Amazon partner Network
115:11 - or adus partner Network and if you want
115:13 - to advance in their Network you have to
115:15 - obtain particular certifications and
115:17 - they have internal ones and external
115:18 - ones and there's internal ones that
115:20 - people don't know about uh but Partners
115:22 - know know about that you have to get
115:23 - like working with AWS um and so GitHub
115:25 - had something similar not all
115:27 - organizations do that some are doing it
115:29 - for different reasons but that's how
115:30 - some of these things start out and so
115:32 - when these ones were engineered at
115:34 - GitHub they were built um to understand
115:38 - all of the products because they want
115:40 - their uh their Partners to know all
115:42 - their products um and the GitHub one
115:45 - doesn't actually cover a lot of git as
115:46 - it's focused mostly on the GitHub
115:48 - products but you're going to learn git
115:49 - either way whether you want to or not
115:51 - because you have to know to toze I me
115:53 - you have to know get in 2024 I'm sorry
115:55 - but like you're going to have to sit
115:56 - down and learn the weird syntax and the
115:58 - weird like yeah still still um and so
116:01 - and so you know um you know when that
116:04 - transitioned as a public thing I think
116:05 - that there was a legacy team and a new
116:07 - team uh uh has taken over and so I
116:09 - believe that um where they are right now
116:12 - is transitioning but when that stuff
116:13 - came out there was funny pricing around
116:15 - it uh like on Twitter uh we came out and
116:18 - I made the courses really quickly but
116:19 - when I went to go register the course I
116:21 - found it was like really expensive and
116:22 - they were all the same price uh and
116:25 - there was just some key things that were
116:26 - missing like there was no uh domain
116:28 - breakdown there was uh you didn't know
116:32 - what your score was but there was all
116:33 - reasons for it right and so I had taken
116:35 - guesses and I talked to GitHub and it
116:36 - turns out I was right on 99% of all the
116:39 - reasons why um but it was just that it
116:41 - was a legacy product that was
116:42 - transitioning to a new team uh and there
116:45 - and it was that they just did not have
116:47 - like they they a lot like the things
116:49 - that I say out loud or anyone say say
116:51 - out loud a lot times they're thinking
116:52 - about the same same thing so when I had
116:54 - voiced those things they heard them and
116:58 - they just needed they just needed
116:59 - external validation to change them and
117:01 - So within weeks they now have domain
117:04 - breakdowns I think they were talking
117:05 - about getting the score in uh there was
117:07 - considerations of bringing get into the
117:09 - the course and so um you know a lot of
117:12 - the reasons why courses are the way they
117:14 - are is because of Legacy reasons or
117:16 - there's product marketers and they want
117:18 - to get certain things in and often the
117:20 - people that actually want to do the
117:21 - curriculum development
117:23 - have to compromise and they don't get to
117:25 - exactly do what they want to do uh and
117:27 - again this is not just GitHub this is
117:28 - all of them adab us hashy Corp all of
117:30 - them right um and so uh you know
117:33 - certifications that's where I where I
117:35 - say they're not efficient or they're
117:37 - there's going to be like 30 or 40%
117:39 - credit that's more about like what
117:40 - product marketers want you to know or
117:42 - like or it's like PR wanted you to know
117:44 - to to to um now this is the GitHub
117:48 - certifications or would you say this is
117:50 - this typifies all certifications I'd say
117:52 - the ones that that do it the least is
117:55 - Hashi Corp certifications for some weird
117:57 - reason Hashi Corp like they have I would
117:59 - say the cleanest uh certifications I've
118:02 - ever seen where it's like every single
118:04 - item on the on on the exam guide is in
118:06 - the course so if there's a if there's a
118:08 - bullo you're going to get a question on
118:10 - it and there's no what are the values of
118:13 - hashy Corp and you know like you know
118:15 - what I'm saying like they're just like
118:16 - how do you use they're like it's
118:18 - terraform and you got to do a deploy
118:19 - what's the command terraform apply right
118:22 - very very uh practical as opposed to you
118:25 - know it's very and at first I wasn't
118:27 - sure about that but I I really like it
118:29 - cuz because like I I know I can go in
118:31 - there I can make the content uh like
118:33 - just go down the list I got good
118:34 - coverage people aren't stressed out
118:36 - about it you know what I mean it has
118:38 - application but these other ones it's
118:41 - just like it's just that there's more
118:43 - people getting involved in them they
118:44 - want to have different kinds of outcomes
118:45 - in them so some some people take over um
118:49 - you know it's it's just the nature of it
118:50 - so if that makes sense so what happened
118:51 - when like you approached them you you
118:53 - had all this this uh these I guess
118:56 - concerns for lack of a better word like
118:57 - this feedback well I just told them like
118:59 - I like I told them I said you know I I'm
119:02 - I'm really excited about the
119:03 - certification I want it to do well when
119:05 - it does well I make money and it lets me
119:07 - make more free courses for it helps
119:09 - everybody please make these changes and
119:12 - what I what I did was and it wasn't that
119:14 - I just like s it out loud like I like I
119:17 - went at them because it happened was
119:19 - that when I told people the price online
119:22 - on Twitter and Linkedin people went no
119:24 - and the price was $200 per certification
119:27 - every certific no no matter what level
119:28 - even the foundational one and so and so
119:31 - that didn't make sense so I took like 50
119:33 - screenshots of people saying like I'm
119:35 - going to pass on this one the price
119:36 - doesn't make sense why is it like this
119:38 - and so I I was it was more like it was
119:40 - more like I'm bringing the internalized
119:43 - feelings of the community and rolling it
119:44 - up and bringing it to them that's
119:45 - usually what I do like when I'm today I
119:47 - was like giving a eight of us a hard
119:48 - time and I give them all a hard time
119:50 - which is not a great not a good move but
119:52 - yeah not great for your relationship
119:54 - with them but great for the end Learners
119:56 - who have to use these certifications I
119:58 - shouldn't say that like there's people
119:59 - like like even when I complain about a
120:01 - say there's people in my DMs that best
120:02 - and and and they they understand and
120:04 - they're working internally to do their
120:05 - best but the it's like these
120:08 - organizations are so large that there's
120:10 - there's good and there's people that are
120:12 - I don't want to say bad but they are uh
120:15 - they prioritize different things
120:16 - prioritize different things and so um
120:19 - you know like the whole point of being a
120:20 - Community member is to be the the check
120:22 - and balance of it but you have to you
120:24 - have to be strategic about it because
120:26 - sometimes complain out complaining out
120:27 - loud is not a good strategy and you need
120:30 - to internally work with them and so you
120:32 - have to have a system so if I have an
120:33 - internal process with somebody I'll
120:35 - always do that first and if if whatever
120:37 - reason that's not working then I will go
120:39 - external so like when I was complaining
120:41 - about ad us TNC today I know TNC leaders
120:43 - are reading it and I know to training
120:46 - certification okay right and so it it's
120:49 - me trying to exert pressure to make
120:52 - changes that's better for everybody and
120:54 - AWS like and the other partner included
120:57 - right but there's a point where
120:59 - sometimes the decision is their decision
121:01 - and you're now you're just being a jerk
121:03 - right and so you have to you have to
121:04 - walk that line and go okay I'm not being
121:07 - somebody that's just uh uh trying to get
121:09 - my way versus something like it's more
121:12 - of a like that's what they want to do so
121:14 - like with GitHub and you know spoiler
121:18 - alert you were able to essentially get
121:21 - them to cut the price of these
121:22 - certifications in half I would say I
121:24 - would say that they want they needed to
121:27 - hear it from the community and I just
121:29 - did the leg work for them I didn't I
121:31 - didn't cut the prices but I mean putting
121:32 - yourself on the line and and carrying
121:34 - that and risking them shooting the
121:36 - messenger and being like screw this
121:37 - Andrew Brown guy he's a rabble Rouser
121:40 - right well I mean it was it was low risk
121:42 - at this point because like I didn't have
121:43 - like an established relationship with
121:45 - GitHub internally but I'm just saying
121:47 - that it can be like if you're if I mean
121:49 - jeopardized potential future
121:50 - relationship you right yeah but you know
121:53 - sometimes like some like it just depends
121:55 - on the attitude some people some people
121:56 - are cool with it right or there are
121:58 - there's like it's like if I had a bad
121:59 - relationship with Hashi now one of my
122:00 - friends works there and and they did the
122:02 - they did the like work and said no
122:03 - Andrew Brown is is here to help and he's
122:06 - going to help you you just got to you
122:07 - got to just work this way and then we'll
122:08 - get this great outcome right like
122:10 - whatever organization and so um it's
122:13 - kind of like that it's it's hard because
122:15 - you got to understand like I'm not here
122:17 - to promote these these companies I'm
122:19 - here to promote the community and so I'm
122:21 - trying to work with these organizations
122:24 - but at the same time it's like at the
122:26 - end of the day these companies are money
122:27 - driven right so yeah I they have to not
122:30 - the people but like the organization as
122:31 - a whole they have to grow they have
122:33 - investors right they're on that bus that
122:36 - can't go below 50 miles an hour so um
122:38 - maybe you could talk a little bit about
122:40 - uh the the improvements that they were
122:42 - able to make thanks to the feedback I
122:45 - gave to the they almost took almost all
122:47 - the feedback that and and the things
122:48 - that they couldn't do it's like it was
122:50 - more like we have to work on this over
122:52 - time so again like they got the domains
122:54 - in so in the video you'll see in the
122:56 - video I go they didn't do domains I
122:57 - think they should do domains they have
122:58 - those in now they're in there right um I
123:01 - think they might show the the exam the
123:03 - the uh the exam the exam score there was
123:06 - like key missing content about the exam
123:08 - that you needed to know to take it they
123:10 - filled that out so like that was where
123:12 - that's an example of um a certification
123:15 - team that is extremely receptive uh and
123:18 - and trying to do the best outcome for
123:20 - their certifications right awesome yeah
123:22 - it's hard it's heartening to hear this
123:24 - and I just want to emphasize that like
123:26 - ultimately your interests and their
123:28 - interests are aligned even though
123:30 - they're trying to make money you're
123:31 - trying to you know ultimately make money
123:34 - in a way but the way you make money is
123:36 - by helping people prepare for these
123:39 - certifications and ultimately get these
123:41 - certifications and have Downstream like
123:44 - success as a result of having earn these
123:46 - certifications and actually
123:48 - understanding the skills and having like
123:50 - I guess is like preparing for a
123:52 - certification is not like it's not like
123:54 - sitting around and playing Tetris to
123:55 - attack all day and having fun right it's
123:57 - a lot of hard work yeah and and money so
124:00 - so like kind of smoothing out their
124:02 - learning curve and and just making
124:04 - things as clear as possible so really
124:05 - you're an advocate for the learner is
124:07 - how I look at you well yeah I mean I I
124:10 - think I I would be a developer Advocate
124:12 - like if I wasn't doing this I I'd be I'd
124:14 - probably do an okay developer Advocate
124:16 - or one of these organizations but um uh
124:19 - you know coming back to that point on um
124:22 - uh you know like advocating for stuff
124:24 - it's like if I if like when I I was so
124:26 - excited about GitHub I I made so much
124:28 - hype on that like so many people even
124:31 - even if the cost was $200 they all like
124:33 - actually when that cost dropped and we
124:35 - we promoted it so many people signed up
124:37 - and we're like I'm taking this
124:38 - certification now and so I feel an
124:41 - obligation to make sure that I I deliver
124:43 - the content that is quality content
124:45 - that's reasonable to pass that that that
124:47 - we're setting like good expectations of
124:49 - the outcome because if I tell I'm going
124:51 - to go get a certification and they go
124:53 - get it and now they're out of money and
124:54 - now they can't pay their bills I feel
124:56 - really bad about it yeah um and that's
124:58 - that's that's a big concern and like
125:00 - even like the courses that coming out
125:01 - for the Inus refresh that I'm doing the
125:02 - big ones that everyone's been waiting
125:03 - for forever um like I'm going to be
125:06 - having like a large disclaimer in the
125:08 - beginning explaining like hey there's
125:10 - going to be gaps in knowledge you need
125:11 - to fill these out go look at other free
125:14 - Cod Camp courses that will have them and
125:16 - I will package as much as I can in here
125:18 - but I can't I can't put the whole sun in
125:20 - here you know what I mean I can't well
125:21 - thing that like the theme running
125:23 - through you know your communication with
125:25 - these certification providers and the
125:27 - the work that you do to try to prepare
125:29 - Learners uh and set expectations
125:32 - reasonably you're not like some hype man
125:34 - that's out like this certification is
125:36 - going to change your life you're like
125:38 - this is one of many things that you're
125:39 - going to need to do if you want to have
125:41 - a successful career over the next 20 30
125:44 - 40 years right like you're you're very
125:47 - um just down to earth and like you don't
125:51 - want to hype things up like you don't
125:52 - want to overpromise and underd deliver
125:54 - well I just don't I don't want people to
125:56 - end up in a spot like it's like we had a
125:58 - we had somebody that was like in Canada
126:00 - that was like Hey I want to become a
126:02 - solution architect and I'm paying $7,000
126:05 - to take a a certification boot camp and
126:07 - I'm going to I'm going to get these five
126:09 - certifications right and they just
126:11 - passed their Cloud partitioner they paid
126:12 - like a thousand like so that means like
126:14 - a, ,500 just to do Cloud partitioner
126:16 - makes no sense to me which we have it
126:17 - for free and it's even more more more
126:19 - robust than any course out there on free
126:21 - C camp and and they're going I'm going
126:23 - to become a solution architect in 9
126:25 - months and I said you're going to get
126:27 - the most senior senior role possible in
126:30 - the in the cloud industry in nine months
126:33 - that's only given to people that have
126:34 - already worked for years and you think
126:36 - you're going to get that and that's
126:37 - that's the promise that that's the
126:39 - overselling that people have and I'm
126:40 - tell I say and I say to them I'm like
126:42 - you should plan for three years you
126:44 - should have all these adjacent skills
126:46 - and you should assume you should have a
126:48 - backup plan because if if you're burning
126:50 - through all your money you're going to
126:52 - be in a bad spot it's not that it's
126:54 - impossible for it to happen it's just
126:56 - that you need to you need to hedge your
126:58 - bets and and put put yourself in the
127:00 - best position yeah and it's not like if
127:03 - we're in 2016 and 2018 like 2016 is
127:06 - probably better say 2016 you got to
127:07 - start that was a different story because
127:09 - at the time
127:10 - everybody was very curious about cloud
127:14 - and they didn't know much about it and
127:16 - you could just say that you had a
127:18 - certification or were going to go sit
127:20 - one and I was like this I was in Toronto
127:22 - and like there was like big fintech
127:24 - fintech banks that said oh yeah you yeah
127:27 - you have your associate and you're going
127:28 - for your pro can you come in and
127:31 - interview and like and then like you'd
127:33 - be doing whiteboarding and they'd be
127:34 - like okay because they just had no
127:36 - domain knowledge whatsoever and it
127:37 - wasn't that it was hard it was just like
127:39 - they had no confidence in it that time
127:41 - is over and it's with everything like
127:43 - now you know what the new thing is is
127:44 - like how are you going to utilize a ml
127:47 - like like large language models or ML
127:49 - and stuff like that and so that's the
127:51 - new thing that people are going and at
127:53 - one point it was like data it was like
127:54 - oh data everything's data driven now
127:56 - everything's like a the new oil and so
127:59 - and so um you know I think that uh like
128:04 - it's just the the cloud industry is
128:05 - matured like anything else and it's not
128:08 - like it's becoming devalued like people
128:10 - like people still need people to build
128:12 - websites that hasn't changed I mean it's
128:14 - just layers right like there's still web
128:16 - development and there's people are still
128:17 - running CL engineering and then there's
128:19 - ML on you know mood Juma those things
128:22 - are still running okay people need
128:25 - throwback people are still using them
128:27 - there's a whole Community around them
128:28 - like yeah I mean like I said earlier for
128:30 - train I joked like oh get some there are
128:33 - main frames running at like you know
128:35 - state governments you know Employment
128:37 - Office things like that that that so use
128:39 - these old tools because you get the
128:41 - system running you don't want to just
128:42 - scrap it and build a new one right there
128:44 - was a kid that got like a like an old
128:46 - supercomputer it was like wasn't old it
128:48 - was like old by like seven years
128:49 - standard and he set it up in his his
128:51 - house his parents helped him buy it and
128:54 - it's like an old IBM one and he learned
128:55 - Fortran on or something and then and he
128:58 - wanted to see the the ones that they had
128:59 - at IBM so IBM invited him over and he
129:01 - got to see them and they ended up hiring
129:03 - him wow that's cool you you know what I
129:04 - mean like it doesn't matter like there
129:06 - was there's like but you there is a
129:10 - smaller pool right like there's one
129:12 - person that still does um um was it cold
129:14 - fusion right there's a there's a woman
129:16 - out there that does c fusion and there's
129:18 - still work for it but the thing is is
129:20 - that you know you have to want to do
129:23 - that um and and be passionate about it
129:26 - and and I think there's opportunities
129:28 - there and I just wish that people would
129:30 - just keep running with it and that's the
129:32 - problem they just they want to really
129:33 - make money and I I get it I understand
129:35 - why yeah but but like in the race to
129:37 - make money like I mean generally like
129:41 - you need a lot fewer skills to do jumla
129:44 - development or WordPress development
129:45 - than you do to be like a machine
129:47 - learning engineer uh I mean a lot of
129:49 - those people have phds and a lot of
129:52 - those people have you know a decade or
129:54 - more experience working as a python
129:56 - developer you know uh doing like just
129:59 - backend development or something like
130:00 - that right A lot of people have domain
130:03 - expertise uh you can absolutely do that
130:07 - you could become a machine learning
130:08 - engineer by the time you are in your
130:10 - mid-20s if you if you do everything
130:13 - right and stuff like that I know machine
130:15 - learning Engineers who are in their mid
130:16 - 20s but it's a lot harder to do that um
130:20 - and I think a lot of lot of people are
130:21 - seeing the machine learning engineers in
130:24 - their 20s and thinking oh I can do that
130:26 - too if I pay this person $10,000 to do
130:29 - their machine learning Boot Camp or
130:31 - whatever right that like there there
130:33 - will be people out there who will
130:34 - happily accept your money to overpromise
130:37 - you know what you're the mileage you're
130:39 - going to get I don't have a problem for
130:40 - people charging $10,000 if it has an
130:42 - outcome if it has the guarant like if
130:44 - you know what you're paying for right
130:45 - but it's like like when you go to a
130:47 - school like accredited school at least
130:49 - in Canada there is like you have your
130:51 - student union you have particular rights
130:53 - have to be enforced curriculums have to
130:54 - be developed a certain way uh they're
130:57 - supposed to have like uh like like on
131:00 - campus stuff and other resources now
131:03 - whether the education is failing in
131:04 - terms of the Quality quality of the
131:05 - materials is a different story but
131:07 - you're paying for that infrastructure
131:09 - around it for a guarantee um though
131:11 - Canada has been having a bit of issues
131:13 - because they've been um getting in
131:15 - trouble for not having uh the proper
131:17 - outcomes as of recent so well I mean the
131:19 - US same thing like there same thing yeah
131:21 - th000 universities or colleges in the
131:24 - United States but I mean come on like
131:25 - how many of those are actually like a
131:28 - college that you would be like really
131:29 - proud to have graduated from well in
131:31 - Canada the the the best school is waterl
131:34 - comp side water you go or University of
131:36 - Toronto is very good but like you go to
131:38 - wlu you'll you'll like you will get a
131:40 - job no matter what you'll get a job
131:41 - because they've they've done such a good
131:44 - job making sure that students have an
131:46 - outcome the cup students get paid right
131:48 - they like you get a 90 if you get 99%
131:50 - you can still fail you get what I mean
131:52 - like they have a they set a really high
131:53 - bar um and uh employers know what
131:56 - they're getting right and so they have
131:58 - that Loop but most schools don't do that
131:59 - they're just like you pay and then you
132:01 - got to go get the job yourself and uh
132:04 - you know what I mean like they they
132:05 - might have some kind of network but it's
132:06 - not as as robust as it is but I'm just
132:09 - saying like if you pay $10,000 or
132:11 - whatever it is to go to Wu it's worth
132:13 - the money right if you get in the right
132:15 - time and you have the money but it's
132:17 - it's these other issues where it's like
132:18 - $10,000 and it was it was all Vapor to
132:22 - begin with um but you know again it's I
132:25 - just want people to make sure that
132:27 - they're getting what they want out out
132:29 - of their money or no if they have no
132:31 - money you know whatever it is right so
132:33 - absolutely yeah and and that's like the
132:35 - name of the game is like under promising
132:38 - overd delivering optimizing for having a
132:40 - reputation which is something you've
132:41 - been investing in for so long uh through
132:44 - everything you've been doing with exam
132:45 - Pro and everything you've personally
132:47 - been doing to advocate for Learners just
132:49 - building up that reputation for or I'm
132:51 - not going to screw you you can trust me
132:53 - that like I'm going to say the reality
132:56 - and not overhype things right um and
133:00 - that's what I want to talk about because
133:01 - there there's I I really need more bread
133:03 - though yeah like literally
133:07 - literally well by optimizing for the
133:10 - long term right like that is the name of
133:13 - the game right optimizing for the next
133:15 - few decades people are still probably
133:16 - going to be taking professional
133:17 - certifications decades from now people
133:19 - are definitely going to still be working
133:21 - as developers regardless of what Jensen
133:23 - Quang
133:25 - CE it's there AI bot that has to go
133:28 - through my certifications that's fine
133:29 - yeah yeah uh it'll just be a few API
133:32 - calls and the certification will be
133:33 - earned no uh I don't believe that that's
133:36 - going to come to pass anytime soon so uh
133:38 - but uh just a quick correction there are
133:42 - 3,931 title for degree granting
133:45 - institutions in the United States so
133:47 - it's not 5,000 it's contracted a little
133:48 - bit which is probably for the better
133:50 - frankly I don't think we 5,000
133:52 - institutions in the United States but
133:55 - um what I wanted to say is
133:58 - um you and I both grew up watching a TV
134:02 - show that's essentially advocates for
134:05 - that value of like optimizing for the
134:06 - longterm following Prime directives and
134:09 - not you know corrupting civilizations
134:12 - with technology too soon Golden Girls
134:14 - Golden Girls right yeah oh yeah Golden
134:16 - Girls that was the show we watched no we
134:18 - we you may have watched that I have
134:20 - never seen an of Golden Girls I'm sorry
134:22 - to say for all the Golden Girls maybe
134:24 - I'll check it I've heard good things but
134:26 - Star Trek so we we've talked about so
134:29 - much we've talked for more than two
134:30 - hours but I do want to the obligatory
134:33 - let's talk about Star Trek because um
134:36 - you and and Andrew your co-founder he's
134:39 - got this giant poster it's like a
134:41 - blueprint of uh oh yeah he he's yeah
134:44 - like of the Starship Enterprise uh I
134:46 - wanted to talk just a little bit because
134:48 - I I do imagine there are a lot of tiies
134:50 - in the audience people who love Star
134:51 - Trek and I love Star Trek because it's
134:54 - got a humanist message I love it because
134:58 - it has intelligent plots and intelligent
135:00 - interactions people are polite they're
135:02 - civil they get things done they're
135:04 - practical but at the same time they have
135:06 - values and uh you know when I was a kid
135:10 - my role model
135:11 - was Captain mcard because he always
135:14 - seemed to like have this high-minded
135:16 - like approach to like solving problems
135:18 - and often he'd be presented with an easy
135:20 - way and he'd be like wait there might be
135:23 - a better way that's not as easy let's
135:25 - see if we can find that he didn't stop
135:27 - merely at the easy way um maybe you can
135:30 - talk a little bit about your
135:31 - relationship with Star Trek over the
135:32 - years I mean Star Trek does set really
135:35 - good uh moral values uh and I I think
135:38 - that's the aspect there is that you have
135:40 - this um uh uh Community or or uh I don't
135:47 - sure the word is I'm trying to look for
135:48 - but the idea is that you have all these
135:50 - people where they're not worried about
135:52 - money they're they're they're trying
135:54 - scarcity post they're have a post scar
135:57 - scarcity mindset and so that they can uh
136:01 - do good do good however they they see
136:03 - fit um and I and I think the thing is
136:07 - like holding up uh your sense
136:10 - of um more like I keep saying morals but
136:14 - the idea like ethics right like so you
136:16 - know like Captain Bard or all these
136:18 - other people have um uh moral ethics
136:21 - about you know what it is that they want
136:23 - to do and and and the betterment of the
136:25 - world and they're not thinking thinking
136:26 - about the uh the materialistic things to
136:29 - to show the EMB betterment of folks and
136:32 - I to me like that is
136:33 - just you know if you can live up to that
136:36 - that that is amazing right and you know
136:38 - I I want to I want to get to that point
136:40 - at some point and so the idea of like
136:42 - producing free content around the world
136:44 - and and having everyone upskill is is
136:47 - that lift up uh you know at least that's
136:50 - what I think so I don't know I think
136:51 - there's a lot of ties there if that
136:53 - makes sense so you see some some of your
136:56 - role as Andrew Brown founder of exam
136:59 - pro. Co like facilitating that kind of
137:02 - path toward a post scarcity Utopia
137:05 - really and it's not a Utopia in the
137:07 - sense that you know everything's solved
137:09 - and people just hang out all day people
137:11 - actually work really hard in Star Trek
137:13 - and they still have regimented work
137:15 - schedules and everybody still follows a
137:17 - strict dress code and all stuff yeah
137:18 - they want to work right they want to
137:20 - work they want to get things done they
137:21 - want to push forward the frontier of
137:23 - human understanding by exploration it's
137:26 - not it's not about going to work so you
137:27 - can make as much money as you can to buy
137:29 - things when you go home uh or go on
137:32 - trips right like it's like you want to
137:34 - actually do things that
137:36 - matter yeah I think a lot of people do
137:38 - want to do things that matter but like
137:40 - when they get into the workforce and
137:42 - it's a different story then and and then
137:44 - also just the nature of businesses um
137:46 - you know that's I think that's the the
137:48 - hard part you know so yeah I mean you
137:50 - and I talked about game development
137:51 - earlier like game development is a
137:53 - terrible field to go into don't go into
137:55 - game development unless you're going to
137:57 - be like an indie like I hear horror
137:58 - stories about people that worked at
138:00 - blizzard and companies like that right
138:03 - um and yet like think of how many
138:06 - creative passionate people who love
138:08 - developing games who are instead you
138:11 - know working as like database
138:14 - administrators or um you know software
138:17 - Engineers that like SAS tech companies
138:19 - because that's where the money is and
138:20 - and they would love they're even hoping
138:22 - to like put away a lot of money so they
138:24 - can eventually go and develop games
138:26 - right just imagine if everybody who
138:29 - wanted to be a game developer could be a
138:30 - game developer and money wasn't like an
138:33 - objective or it wasn't a consideration
138:35 - right well I mean I think a lot of them
138:36 - it wasn't like you look at uh I'm trying
138:38 - remember his name but it's the creator
138:40 - of Fallout the original series he has a
138:42 - YouTube channel he's that would be
138:44 - really good interview I'd love to hear
138:46 - intervie he's on he's on YouTube um I
138:48 - just can't remember his name for some
138:49 - reason but um
138:51 - uh like he talks about like how like it
138:54 - reminds me of when I got into Tech which
138:55 - is like the idea like the reason of
138:57 - course I was a bit strategic that I
138:59 - didn't go to game development because I
139:00 - need I know I had to make some money but
139:02 - the idea of working with like a
139:03 - passionate team and everyone's excited
139:05 - about working on this thing and and
139:06 - moving towards a common goal is like
139:08 - super exciting that was like my huge
139:10 - draw for startups because like you fix
139:12 - computers it's like computer in computer
139:13 - out you know what I mean I don't want to
139:15 - do that forever um but like the idea of
139:18 - building some kind of big product that
139:19 - is bigger than that uh than all of us
139:21 - together and it's going to be an EMB
139:23 - betterment for everybody there's like a
139:24 - funny scene in in um Silicon Valley
139:26 - where they're they're at uh uh the
139:29 - startup like like the tech crunch or
139:31 - something and they're all pitching their
139:32 - products Tech startup disrupt I actually
139:34 - pitched there I went to their big
139:36 - hackathon and I was the first out of 350
139:39 - people that were presenting I had to be
139:41 - on the stage first but every product is
139:43 - like they're like we're trying to be loo
139:45 - Cal and mobile like they trying to help
139:48 - trying to help people it's going to
139:50 - better world and like that was kind of
139:52 - like the like the reason I really got
139:53 - into startups like uh but it's just the
139:56 - fact that um there's that component but
139:58 - anyway he was talking about the video
140:00 - game industry and like he's like you can
140:02 - get paid to make video games and they
140:05 - like they're obviously being exploited
140:06 - and they didn't mind because they all
140:08 - they wanted to do was all day every day
140:11 - work on video games like a workaholic
140:13 - and that's like how kind of like how I
140:14 - am where it's like you can make you can
140:16 - make money doing this you can make money
140:18 - teaching people how to code and it
140:20 - wasn't like I was trying to make
140:21 - millions I just to like the idea is like
140:23 - youd make something and then you know
140:25 - you can kind of do whatever you want or
140:27 - or like I met like a lot of early
140:28 - startups where they they had their their
140:30 - dot startup that did really well and so
140:32 - now they're kind of reliving their
140:34 - dreams as Angel Investors and they're
140:36 - like we we would go and hang out with
140:37 - them and and they were like really good
140:39 - mentors but unfortunately again it's
140:41 - just the nature of where things where
140:43 - things go um which is like can we have
140:46 - that without the whole uh greed
140:48 - component in there I don't know how that
140:50 - works yeah I mean like I think it's just
140:52 - necessary like everybody wants to make a
140:53 - return I I used to think like oh man
140:56 - there's like something fundamentally
140:57 - flawed like capitalism is just racing us
141:00 - toward this this outcome and and that
141:02 - may be the case but in general if you
141:05 - have money and you want to make a return
141:07 - on it you need to invest money in things
141:08 - that are going to grow and if a company
141:12 - is not growing then why would you put
141:14 - your money there because you have to
141:15 - make just inflation right inflation is
141:18 - normally about 2 to 3% in the United
141:20 - States so you have to make at least 2 to
141:22 - 3% or else you're losing money every
141:24 - year and like what if you're a big
141:25 - pension fund like cpers the big
141:27 - California pension fund you have to find
141:30 - enough places that you can put money to
141:31 - get growth so that you can continue to
141:33 - compound apparently uh inflammation uh
141:37 - inflammation infl infl uh inflation
141:40 - that's my trick for losing weight but I
141:41 - get inflammation for for months I'm not
141:43 - joking I get inflammation for months and
141:44 - I lose a bunch of weight it's the best
141:47 - uh uh best way to lose weight but anyway
141:49 - uh inflation like I was watching a video
141:50 - about like Japan and how they had INF uh
141:53 - deflation well they just had no
141:55 - inflation for for uh for many years and
141:58 - they're talking about like you want to
142:00 - have gradual inflation because uh it
142:02 - stimulates spend or something like it
142:04 - was important they're like it's good you
142:06 - have to have a little bit yeah you do
142:07 - want some inflation the main reason you
142:09 - want inflation is because deflation is
142:11 - incredibly catastrophic if you ever get
142:12 - into a a state of deflation nobody's
142:15 - spending any money cuz like why would
142:16 - you spend money you just hoard your
142:18 - money because your money's going to be
142:20 - worth more tomorrow than it is today so
142:22 - why would you spend it today and as a as
142:24 - a result everybody hoardes their money
142:26 - and the economy just grinds to a halt so
142:28 - you don't want deflation but you want
142:31 - some amount of inflation just to ensure
142:33 - that there's a buffer between you know
142:37 - not not going into deflationary
142:38 - territory because it's so catastrophic
142:40 - but sorry you yeah Japan is a very
142:42 - interesting economy to study if anybody
142:44 - out there likes studying about economics
142:46 - and stuff like the the policy
142:49 - interesting like experiment they do is
142:51 - like they've had so many weird economic
142:53 - experiments it's so interesting yeah but
142:56 - sorry you were talking about um how do
142:58 - we get on that we were talking about
143:01 - um so if we if we go back to Star Trek
143:04 - which is what I really want to talk
143:05 - about sure why not yeah like
143:08 - like how would you be different if you
143:11 - had if Star Trek had never existed do
143:13 - you think it opened some
143:15 - perspectives uh do you think it's
143:18 - spurred your imagination I I think maybe
143:21 - like maybe I'd be more opportunistic and
143:22 - I I would be less focused on like
143:24 - Community involvement like I think the
143:25 - reason I'm so involved in community
143:27 - involvement is because it was mandatory
143:28 - because my uh my grandfather who was uh
143:31 - like he was like my mom just won an
143:33 - award in the province for volunteering
143:35 - and my my grandfather uh did a lot of
143:38 - volunteering in Thunder Bay like like he
143:41 - ran uh the hockey for the kids in the
143:43 - entire town the the soccer he ran like
143:47 - uh the bingo halls did all his volunteer
143:49 - work for kids
143:51 - uh uh and um I guess it was just because
143:54 - like he was a like a veteran from World
143:56 - War II and he had like terrible
143:59 - upbringing right his dad died when he
144:00 - was young because uh um his dad was a uh
144:05 - mortician or whatever that you the
144:07 - person that handles the dead people yeah
144:08 - so his dad died when he was young so he
144:10 - was like really poor and then uh you
144:13 - like he went to war and they thought he
144:14 - died and they spent all his money so
144:16 - came back he had to work harder like at
144:17 - the Mill or whatever and so you know
144:20 - this the greatest Generation having such
144:21 - a hard time I feel like they did a lot
144:23 - more for their their Community because
144:25 - of uh the hard times that they had and
144:27 - so that part like I spent so much time
144:29 - with my grandparents that uh it just
144:31 - became something that you're supposed to
144:33 - do like you don't even think about like
144:34 - why are you doing this there's no money
144:35 - and it's like what do you mean you're
144:38 - you do this because it's good for
144:39 - everybody right like it wasn't it was
144:41 - never a thought of like like why
144:43 - wouldn't you do this and it's like then
144:44 - you have Star Trek which is also
144:46 - enforcing that thing of like why are why
144:48 - are you working for money
144:51 - yeah like why are you doing that that
144:52 - makes no sense that doesn't better
144:53 - anybody so yeah they even have the fangi
144:55 - who are this alien species that is
144:57 - focused on wealth and like accumulation
145:00 - of wealth and it's supposed to model
145:02 - like the 20th century humans in the 21th
145:05 - century that's not to say like I don't
145:07 - think about money at all like I have to
145:08 - because there's a bare minimum which is
145:10 - very frustrating I I hate it but you
145:12 - know at some but I go I need to make
145:14 - money so I can do the things that I want
145:16 - to do which is to do you know better
145:18 - things um you know and again like if if
145:22 - for long term right so yeah
145:24 - unfortunately it's still a thing that
145:25 - you have to do but like it's it's like
145:26 - getting to a point where I don't have to
145:28 - do it which is which is really I sure
145:30 - everybody I know so many teachers uh
145:33 - teachers social workers other people who
145:34 - are frankly like greatly undervalued by
145:37 - Society in terms of their compensation
145:39 - but they love the work they they know
145:40 - the work needs to be done they want to
145:42 - do it even at personal sacrifice um yeah
145:47 - well I want to close with this question
145:50 - about Star Trek cuz I love Star Trek so
145:52 - much and uh have you watched all of Star
145:55 - Trek like have you watched like every
145:57 - single
145:58 - series yep You' even watched like the
146:00 - new ones like theard yep yeah
146:05 - okay who is your favorite Captain who
146:08 - who do you think best exemplifies the
146:10 - values of like you know Starfleet and uh
146:14 - I mean Bard probably but I mean like my
146:15 - favorite Captain is
146:17 - Cisco I really like Captain Cisco from
146:19 - Deep Space 9
146:22 - yeah what just what do you like about
146:23 - him I I think he's more of a pragmatist
146:25 - so like like he like Deep Space 9 takes
146:28 - place on a um uh the frontier uh a
146:32 - Frontier where it's on like on the out
146:35 - like the outskirts of the Federation and
146:38 - so their values are being tested all the
146:40 - time right um and I think that that's
146:42 - really interesting to say okay you have
146:44 - this utopian but what how do you deal
146:46 - with it when you're you're dealing with
146:48 - people that don't have all the benefit
146:50 - things that you have and how are you
146:52 - going to meet in the middle and uh and
146:55 - how are you going to like where are you
146:56 - going to compromise in terms of your
146:59 - moral values and and I think that that
147:01 - Captain uh handles it in a very a very
147:04 - interesting way and we get uh very
147:06 - interesting uh story lines uh yeah like
147:08 - kind of real politic because Prosperity
147:10 - is not evenly distributed and we talk
147:12 - about the post scarcity but that's
147:14 - really human civilizations Vulcans and a
147:17 - few other uh a few other races have like
147:21 - that level of prosperity but you you do
147:24 - have people that are suffering quite a
147:25 - bit and uh you know starf can't help
147:28 - everybody right the Federation can't
147:29 - help everybody they have to make these
147:31 - kind of tactical decisions and also the
147:33 - d space 9 there is like a diplomatic
147:36 - kind of show like you've got the Waring
147:38 - factions that are kind of constantly
147:40 - encroaching on one another's space and
147:41 - getting into territorial disputes and
147:43 - things like that too so but yeah I mean
147:46 - again like I'd say yeah Cisco is my
147:47 - favorite Captain but if if we're talking
147:49 - about the ideals Ard Picard always is uh
147:52 - is the one there that I think that uh
147:53 - upholds it the best yeah and some people
147:55 - may even see Picard's boring because
147:57 - he's he's to two dimensional because he
148:00 - just has these uh very specific like you
148:03 - can almost always predict what bicard is
148:04 - going to do given a certain situation if
148:07 - you've watched some s trick because he
148:09 - he is a very uh I mean he does grow and
148:11 - progress as as a human uh and he's
148:15 - constantly reading constantly learning
148:17 - he lover of history but at the same time
148:21 - you know that like at the end of the day
148:22 - he's going to take the most high-minded
148:24 - approach and he's not going to
148:25 - compromise his ideals and yeah that that
148:28 - can make it less exciting than watching
148:30 - somebody who's much more Dynamic than
148:31 - Cisco yeah and then if somebody just
148:35 - wanted to watch like one Star Trek show
148:39 - to like like they've never watched Star
148:42 - Trek before you want to get somebody
148:44 - like eased into the Star Trek universe
148:47 - what would you recommend they start with
148:49 - I mean I have a very particular favorite
148:51 - episode of Star Trek my favorite episode
148:53 - is duet from Deep Space 9 season 1
148:55 - season one is not a very good season but
148:57 - that's an excellent episode um and uh
149:01 - this very I was actually like no one
149:03 - ever talked about this episode for years
149:04 - but then a few years ago I think uh it
149:06 - gained some popularity because someone
149:08 - in um I think his St Trek Discovery was
149:10 - like Hey I really like this episode I
149:12 - think this was was fantastic but this
149:14 - specific episode is about um Kieran
149:17 - narice and their uh for those who don't
149:21 - know like
149:23 - beour beour yeah we're going here beour
149:27 - is a is a um a a world that was uh
149:30 - occupied by the Kardashians for years
149:33 - and the Kardashians uh uh basically
149:37 - enslaved them and had them strip mine
149:39 - their own Planet taking all of their
149:41 - resources and then uh the Kardashians uh
149:45 - were in a war with the Federation and
149:47 - wasted a lot of resources and then they
149:49 - decided that the uh the war was over
149:51 - they were having a peace with the
149:52 - Federation and they decided that they're
149:53 - going to uh leave beor and put it back
149:56 - in the beor people because they've taken
149:59 - all that they've wanted um and so uh
150:04 - beour has a lot of animosity towards um
150:09 - the cardasians for their treatment and
150:11 - so in this
150:12 - episode uh Kieran arice sees that there
150:15 - is a ship coming through to the station
150:18 - and it has a very specific
150:20 - Kardashian that was known for running
150:22 - labor camps on beour and so they wanted
150:26 - they want to bring him in for war crimes
150:29 - even though but the card say there was
150:31 - no war because they were just occupied
150:33 - right historical revisionism essentially
150:36 - yeah and so and so this fellow here well
150:39 - I'll end up like I'll end up ruing it I
150:41 - tell you but the point is is that it's
150:43 - it's about it's about this and it
150:45 - changes her mindset and it's the fact
150:47 - that it's about the what like about this
150:50 - episode it
150:51 - challenges uh like your your
150:53 - preconceptions about people um and
150:56 - that's what I like it's like when you
150:58 - have those those kind of moments yeah so
151:00 - that's that's my favorite episode but
151:01 - there's a lot of good episodes out there
151:04 - um but a lot of people like uh what's
151:07 - the one it's like
151:09 - uh the light or um it's it's the one
151:13 - Inner Light yeah people the in light's
151:15 - very good um there's that one uh there's
151:18 - another really good DS9 one which like
151:21 - it's uhing the moonlight moonlight
151:24 - something I I don't know why I can't
151:25 - recall right now or something like that
151:28 - anyway but yeah I if there was one that
151:30 - I'd start with is duet I think it's the
151:32 - best one that's that for me anyway for
151:34 - me in the pale Moonlight in the oh
151:36 - that's really good so so I haven't
151:39 - gotten that far in d space 9 uh I I'm on
151:42 - like season four season five I've just
151:43 - been gradually working through it
151:44 - through adulthood so I haven't gotten
151:46 - there cuz I'm I'm like I've heard it's
151:48 - so hyped up I don't know what'll happen
151:50 - have you have you heard have you heard
151:52 - the greatest Generation podcast huh the
151:54 - great there's these two fellows in in
151:56 - the the US and they it's called the
151:58 - greatest generation and they watch every
152:01 - single episode of Star Trek and they do
152:03 - a podcast on it but they oh wait I have
152:05 - watch I hav heard but I heard it like
152:07 - way back when it first started and I'm
152:08 - like yeah I think they finished
152:10 - everything and now they're doing uh they
152:12 - said they'd never do Babylon 5 and now
152:14 - they're doing Babylon 5 which we know be
152:16 - and I love Babylon 5 that's another good
152:17 - series but yeah very heavy diplomacy
152:21 - Focus five different alien races that
152:23 - have to like essentially coincide and
152:25 - stuff yeah man I could talk all day
152:28 - about this uh so shout out to duet which
152:31 - is in season one of Deep Space 9 you
152:33 - don't have to be very deep into Deep
152:34 - Space 9 what the first eight episodes
152:36 - and Bam one of the greatest episodes of
152:38 - Star Trek ever right there I I finally
152:41 - remember that episode uh so yeah I I
152:44 - guess parting wisdom for the community
152:46 - be sure to check out some of Andrew's
152:49 - awesome courses and note that if you
152:51 - hear AI voice it's not
152:54 - just because he lazy but to protect his
152:57 - actual voice yeah if you can tell but
152:59 - you know like again most if it's like my
153:01 - core courses it's going to be me yeah
153:03 - but uh yeah there's just some they'll
153:05 - never get made unless we use that AI
153:07 - voice so yeah well hey Andrew I know
153:10 - that you and I talk all the time we're
153:12 - constantly corresponding about upcoming
153:13 - courses that you're developing but I
153:15 - just want to thank you right here on the
153:16 - podcast I want to thank you again for
153:18 - everything you're doing not just for the
153:20 - developer community Through developing
153:23 - these amazing courses which you're
153:24 - publishing for free on the fre Cod Camp
153:27 - Community YouTube channel but also for
153:29 - the advocacy work you're doing for
153:31 - people who are earning these
153:32 - certifications like taking your insights
153:35 - and sharing them with AWS sharing them
153:37 - with GitHub trying to get these
153:39 - certifications to be improved right
153:41 - risking your own reputation that some
153:44 - manager is going to shoot the messenger
153:46 - because you really do want these
153:47 - certifications to be good you want them
153:49 - to be representative of what people want
153:52 - to learn and
153:54 - obviously there are so many things you
153:56 - could do to probably improve your own
153:58 - personal situation uh
154:00 - financially you've got all these
154:02 - incredible skills uh you've worked as a
154:04 - CTO you've run consultancies you've done
154:06 - all these things and yet you're choosing
154:09 - to continue to help more people earn
154:11 - these certifications and for that I
154:13 - commend you sir I really appreciate
154:15 - everything you're doing and I think the
154:17 - community appreciates it and all the
154:19 - people who've listened to this who are
154:21 - going to go out and earn professional
154:23 - certifications I hope you all uh keep
154:27 - sharing the enthusiasm for learning
154:30 - education uh working us toward that post
154:34 - scarcity civilization that will
154:36 - hopefully be there for our great great
154:38 - great grandkids maybe sooner um yeah
154:41 - thank you again yeah and you know I I
154:44 - just want to say that if there's any
154:45 - companies that are watching this and
154:47 - they want to sponsor a certification
154:50 - course they can absolutely reach out to
154:52 - free camp and and make that opportunity
154:54 - uh there's a lot of courses that I want
154:55 - to create but I just there's there's no
154:59 - there's no money in it but I want to
155:00 - make them right like yeah and I and if

155:18 - a fantastic week until next week happy
155:21 - coding by

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to the free Cod Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org and each week I'm bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week I'm joined by the legendary and prolific Andrew Brown he's a CTO turned cofounder of exampro doco he started the exam prep website with another guy named Andrew who's also from Canada who also loves Star Trek Andrew welcome to the podcast thanks for having me and you know I just want to point out that uh even though it's we have theca it just doesn't sound as uh as nice when you say it so yeah yeah well um it's such a cool website you've got so many resources on there and uh you've shared those resources so abundantly with the global developer Community using free C free code Camp as a conduit for helping people prepare for various Cloud certifications you know your AWS CER certifications your Azure certifications Google Cloud uh even like a lot of the uh like uh I guess more advanced like kubernetes certifications things like that uh so it's so cool to finally have you on the podcast after knowing you for like six years uh collaborating on all these amazing courses yeah I think I just showed up one day and I said uh you have to publish this course I had this I had this big course like I like I always wanted to make free content um and you know when we first started out I was I was pressured into monetizing it which I really didn't want to do um and so I had to I had to do that and fail and luckily that failed which was great and so then I was able to take these giant courses that would not normally be free and make them free which is which is really exciting yeah yeah we're all about free and uh I just want to take a moment to thank the 8,562 kind folks around the world who support free Cod Camp our charity each month by donating some amount of money to our charity and uh these donations are a huge help and they make programming like this possible they make it possible for me to work fulltime on free C Camp and for uh like nearly three dozen other folks Engineers teachers around the world to also focus on creating free learning resources for everyone so thanks thanks to everybody and again thank you to Andrew for just supporting free Cod Camp through this amazing wealth of learning resources that you share uh I I mean it seems like you published probably five or six courses a year at least like it's it's amazing how quickly you develop like updated like the the moment one of these certifications updates uh it's like you're right there right or the moment a new certification launches we'll talk about like the GitHub certifications in a little bit yeah that was fast the moment it comes out you're like there with uh with your camera out like having already passed the exam ready to like explain exactly how people can you know pass the like you've passed I don't know how many certification exams do you think you've passed in your career as a you know prep you know instructor I don't know like it's Le like at least 30 at least 30 unique unique certifications and you know what's really weird is like I actually have to fail them now because what I learned was that um if I pass them I can't take the updated exam so like I have to go in and then I have to fudge them but sometimes I end up passing and I'm not supposed to but I just like want to so do you know what I mean like I'm just like I'll pass it but uh yeah I don't know it's just um uh after you do so many it becomes uh trivial so which is a good thing right you put the time in you can do anything yeah the mob boss is telling you to throw the fight but you're just like I got to pass it I can't hold back my knowledge of cloud yeah so cool well before you were a exam you know expert uh in in passing all these different Cloud exams of course you worked as a CTO but before that you had kind of a family business around computer repair still exists okay awesome maybe you can tell us a little bit about like your humble Origins as somebody repairing computers and working with your family on this you know our family business came about because you know my mom she was in uh was system administrator for or just the admin for Bell in our in our hometown so bell bell Canada which is a telecom company they had a large presence in our our town and so she managed is it related to like AT&T American Telegraph and telephone so they had like the the southern southwestern bill was the Texas and Oklahoma uh phone company and they got broken up into a whole bunch of different baby bells so it's possible that this was like a Canadian you know I've seen like I've seen like Bell and AT&T I thought Bell was Canadian because I thought Alexander Bell was Canadian but um for what I again I I don't know the logistics of it but all I know is that we had a large presence of Bell in I'm in Ontario in Northwest Ontario and so um they had uh they they had new ownership um and they built a big expensive building it turns out that was too expensive and so then they down downsized the uh want Hometown and my my mom didn't want want to move to Toronto she wanted to stay up North with her family um and so uh she took all the skills that she learned from uh being an administrator and then went into computer repair um and so that was the entrepreneurial business and so that's where I was fixing computers and um I transitioned from there doing uh Tech education so like I've been doing it forever um where I would go on site and I would train train people at their homes on their computers yeah well that is so cool first of all I had no idea that Alexander granbell was Canadian I think you learned something new every day and uh according to wikkipedia uh yes Bell Canada divested from AT&T I'm not sure what exactly that means I maybe they were involved in AT&T at some point anyway this is not the corporate History Podcast this is the learn to code podcast but still is it it's it's cool so um so that's cool your mom was a admin early on and uh so maybe you can talk about like the dayto day like did they start the company where you were still a kid were you able to work there when you were a kid or like how old were you when you got your first job I remember uh I think it was like 95 or 96 was when uh my mom opened uh the business uh and so I mean as early as like 15 16 I was I was there cuz it started it started at in our house in our basement right um and so we had computers there and then she got an office and uh you know I just I just love computers like I I was always on computers and um you know I was always trying to to help my mom whe whether it was writing word word perfect macros MH doing PowerPoint presentations uh anything right and so um you know I just became really good at uh web Technologies and things like that and so you know she was was giving me work because she was getting referred to build websites and other things like that and she didn't know how to do it um and so I took on that work and then because I was good at doing that and that was not causing any issues I was allowed to then fix computers and uh do repairs and things like that so so just from creating simple macros for Microsoft Word you you gradually progress and so it sounds like you had like an early love of computers and Technology I used to be I used to go take uh college courses like when I was 10 so like I like just like if it was computer anything it would be like we're going to do the whole Microsoft Word Suite or and like and I just wanted to go do that and I would I'd be like so excited to do word processing or or anything like it like it was on Photoshop or whatever as a kid that's that was my extra uh extracurricular activities was was doing that kind of stuff um so I have like college certificates when I'm like 10 or 12 for random Technologies yeah that's so cool so sounds like very early on did you would you say you envisioned yourself working with computers for the rest of your life like it was there a specific point where you're like yeah this is what I do this is who I am or was it just kind of a gradual progression I I I just think it was just like that fascination of it I mean yeah there's the aspect it was the family business and so like my brother fixed computers and I fixed computers but um and my my two sisters worked at the company for for a while but uh it just seemed like that was what I was destined to do because it was the trade of of the family yeah well what were some of your earliest memories of using computers like what were some were there any inflection points where you're like did just pulled you in deeper like I remember I I often talk about nintendo.com their chat room and like talking to different people and realizing hey I can use HDML to like change the font size and it'll change the font size for everybody so I'd like troll people making the font really large um because it was just such a poorly built like you know chat room system from like 1994 1995 like do do you remember like any sort of like moments that just pulled you in deeper into technology I mean like I remember playing kmen San Diego and I was really obsessed with that it was like I think like 92 like I was like probably five or six and I just I loved playing K in San Diego and like I learned how to use the the Doss promp to I mean which doesn't sound that crazy uh now because kids are so uh technically um uh Savvy like even even young kids I would say but like I knew how to work MS dos to to get into any program that I wanted to um and I don't know it's just the fascination of of uh I guess video games or that interactivity like the like the opportunity that you could do with it right yeah yeah 100% Cara San Diego they have a new version of the show on Netflix that my kids love they watch it in Chinese for Chinese they have a new version yeah it's pretty good like she's like like with the m like do you have the map and you run around you put the map on like they have the endgame map is it like the so so like a show it's not it's not like a video game so it's not interactive but she's just like traveling around with her like team of like inventors and other people that are like helping her like her computer person like they always have like the giant vond character and like the Q character essentially like the person who creates the interesting gadgets uh or the person who knows all the fills Carmen in all all these background information for her mission to go undercover as like a museum you know a curator or what whatever uh crazy stories uh but but it's a really cool show um and and yeah that game was really cool and of course I love the where in the world is K San Diego from the TV show as a kid the acappellas yeah the acella I always wanted rockapella there you go I always wanted to be on that game show of course it was never going to happen but um uh I don't know I just always wanted to play that end that end level where they're running around on the map and they they're placing the markers in time and I really wanted to win the uh it was like a pocket translator I always thought that would be really cool to have for whatever reason but uh such a cool show and like such like uh like a celebration of like curiosity and intellectualism in an era that like you know he man smash you know type stuff right maybe this was slightly later this was like in the 90s well how old are you if you don't mind me asking like what year were you born in 87 87 Okay cool so you're like seven years younger than me um so yeah you were you you had like internet computers like seven years earlier probably in your life than I did well again because my mom worked for Bell like we had a connection right like I remember before Netscape and having internet yeah you know like before uh which by the way I love Netscape uhet Netscape Navigator it was great um I I mean I wish Firefox was uh still holding holding well as it used to but it's uh a different thing these days yeah well let's let's talk about uh you know what did you do from there so you're working at a family business of course did you dream of branching out and creating your own business did you have like a kind of a Founder bug so to speak that bit you early on and you wanted to be like your mom and start something uh you I I realized I didn't want to create computers forever I I like the idea of building applications programming like like maybe going to like I thought maybe I wanted to go to video games but I realized like at early age that um that industry they're overworked they're not paid well and so I thought okay maybe that's more of a hobby and so um I just got really good I wasn't intentional but I just got really good at websites and web application development and you know for me it was like it it scratched that itch enough and so I just kept running with it yeah and so where did you go from there like getting good is one thing but were you able to do like freelance work oh yeah like um so you know I got all my work through um uh a women organization called perro so you know my mom was a woman a woman entrepreneur and so she knew a bunch of other women entrepreneurs and so I basically built all their websites so anytime there was a website to be built uh I would build it I really wanted to build web applications um but uh there was no demand and no understanding of that in my hometown uh I wanted to move to Toronto I did not have the money and I was trying to get a job there I just see I couldn't even so I like I spent years learning how to build apps and I could do all the work but uh nobody was taking the uh the gamble on me um and so you know one day I had a client um and she wanted to use this open Source technology called Ruby that was built in Ruby on Rails and uh it was an open source project and it just was not in a great state and so at the time Twitter was starting to kick around and it was like 2008 or something um I yeah early Ruby on Rails project not not the best example of Ruby on rail's capabilities in that it had like the fail whale and would frequently crash but but yes but um uh so anyway they uh this open source project um you know I I knew I knew how to fix it up and so I just said hey this is not a great application for what you want to do uh and so I put two weeks of effort not not being asked but I just started uh working on it um and that Co the the founder of that company decided to hire me remotely and and then move me to to Barcelona where I became the of that company so for years I was like stacking my skills but like I just couldn't get work and like I would go and take a Greyhound bus all the way down to from Thunder Bay to Toronto which was like a oh I don't know like 16 hour ride each way or something ridiculous and I would go for one day to go to Toronto to go to like a Meetup um uh just to be around other people that were working with more Advanced Technologies and to try to get an opportunity but you know placers just did not want to hire me because I wasn't local yeah wow and this was obviously like decades before the remote work I guess acceptance before employers accepted that you didn't have to be sitting in a cubicle somewhere where they could come in you know ask you to come in on Sunday or whatever whatever the the you know office space thing is um yeah that so Barcelona this is not like Barcelona Canada this is like Barcelona Spain Barcelona you moved to you moved to Europe yeah yeah but you know what uh uh I did really well there because um in terms of technology they were always like two three year 2 three years behind building what was already built in North America so it's like they're building it for their market right it's like and all we were building was a project manager it was a competitor to to um base camp um so that I mean back then I would have loved to work for base camp but again of course uh no opportunities there so yeah I worked on that and that was uh uh really good um and then from there I just went to a string of startups because I just became really good at uh rapidly building applications and sing them up and so I would find like startups that had seed or preed money and I would come in and I would help them close their round and build their deck and hire their hire their first engineers and scale them to whatever their goal was whether it was like 200,000 to 500,000 users and I was really good at it um but that but I was never like really cut in in the same way of the original cofounders because I wasn't there on Day Zero so they they I just never had the same um opportunities yeah so I I grew I grew tired of that not being able to um uh not having the same negotiation skills to uh to to make the money but putting the work in and so then I decided to just do my own firm and just make more money yeah that's so cool that like you got to be on the ground floor of all these SS even if you weren't getting like the founder level of equity which for anybody who's not familiar with like how startups work I'll just give a very very very quick High futin you know uh but basically you have two or three people that come together sometimes it's one person like a lot of big projects don't have C Founders they just have one person starting them but uh then the founders divide up their equity and then they have like a lot of times they'll have like their like 20% for early hires and then 20% for everybody else basically and the founders will keep you know like 30 or 40% depending on how well they can negotiate with investors um so you're not getting the founder Equity of like 10% of the company or something like that 20% of the company you're getting like 1% as like an early hire maybe 2% right something like that well well well in my situation like I was getting a large percentage but um like it' be 10 or 15% but there was like yeah but there's strings attached where it's like it it vests over this period and yeah and there's like a cliff it was the cliff and you know what would do they uh it happened twice to me where where it was like they because I was the most expensive employee with the large amount of shares and like if they want to raise another round they want to claw back that stuff and so they like I got let go one like one time and the other time it's just like I don't know the point was is that startups are are very tricky and uh you have to be very good at advocating for yourself and making sure you're looking it for yourself because these it's all about money right yeah and uh at the end of the day it's like if you leave yourself open for people to take things away from you they will uh and it's just the nature of that uh of that industry unfortunately so yeah I mean it's a Zer some you know like every percent that we don't have to give to Andrew Brown we can keep for ourselves that kind of uh and people get really weird about money I I mean I think I think it's also hard because it's like you know I don't think people are always trying to be a bad person but just like it can mess with your mind uh or justifications uh uh um tap in but if you ever seen the show silic and Valley yeah it was like that that's what it was like it was like that every every day it just it was a little bit too wild for me but uh yeah you just have to have a lot of luck and um and uh negotiating skills and things like that yeah I have a lot of friends who are startup veterans who started watching silon Valley and stopped because they were like this is giving me like flashbacks of like horrible experiences yeah for years I watch yeah for years I wouldn't watch that show I just like I was I couldn't take it but now it's now it's fun um I think I think the industry is in a different place but that was just a time and place how it was so yeah well Time Heals all wounds right like uh you could probably go back and watch it now and laugh about it you know yesterday's tragedy is today's comedy uh not in all circumstances but in some certain circumstances for sure uh so yeah that that is a show like de definite recommended viewing for anybody who wants to work in Tech uh it just highlights the absurdity of zero interest rate you know crazy you know Venture Capital funded growth and like incompetence at the incumbent players that are being disrupted by the newcomers and all this stuff it so all those different Dynamics you get in Silicon Valley and San Francisco like the kind of the mecca of tech so to speak like uh and and Toronto of course has a pretty pretty good developer scene as well right oh yeah for for Canada yeah it's um yeah fin fintech healtech uh a for some reason ml's always been I mean I'm sure everybody thinks they're an ml Hub but like yeah ml has been heavy Focus for for years for Toronto yeah yeah yeah and mL of course stands for machine learning which is what powers all the AI products that are coming out uh so wow so you did this kind of like rent a CTO type uh basically approach where everybody brought you in you were the fixer like like a bunch of BU business guys who don't know very much about technology they they're able to get funding but they don't have the chops to actually build and ship so they bring and you the fixer the the the server Whisperer yeah I I mean like the thing was it was more like it was like I mean they thought what they were doing was they were uh working to like it was contract to hire so they're like we want to call you C we want you to be CTO we want to give you shares i' be like no I don't want shares just give me money just give me money and and if things go really well then maybe I'll think about it but you know for me I was I was just stacking money at that point and like I had a different cofounder at the time and and that's uh what we were doing because we wanted to bootstrap something we really wanted to do right so we wanted to build like a product like a tech product or I always wanted to do Tech education but it wasn't the interest of my previous cofounder um and it just we weren't never getting there it was just like we were just building thing after thing and we're building up this team of a firm with developers and I'm just like I don't like doing this I don't want to keep building projects for other people that I don't believe in uh even if it makes really good money and so we had to talk and and we said it's time to do something different yeah and I just want to like highlight what you said there like just give me money I don't need stock options like a lot of companies will give stock options as a form of incentive and stuff and you know if it's like a big public company that you're working for like Walmart or Amazon or something like that that's it's almost kind of like free money in the sense that like though you are going to be able to liquidate those stock but certainly in the US if you get a bunch of stock from like a company like uber and Uber just takes forever to go public they they might have like this like there were a lot of people who worked at early engineers at Uber who um by the way super pumped documentary shows you just how evil that company was the Evil Genius of Travis kenic uh of course played by uh Joseph Gordon Levitz I strongly recommend people watch that show uh I think it's on Netflix um yeah super cool show just showing you how Makia like if you don't care about the rules and you just break all the rules like H it was is like it's definitely like watching like Breaking Bad where you're like almost rooting for the bad guy but you know he's so bad and you feel so guilty for like empathizing and like wanting him to win but anyway a lot of people at Uber had like millions of dollars worth of shares that they couldn't exercise because there was no exit and there was like this Sunset the lockin Peri or I can't remember what it's called but basically you have to exercise your options and if you don't exercise them before this date then and and but at the same time you have to pay a whole bunch of tax whenever you exercise those options so there were people who like literally didn't have the cash on hand to get millions of dollars worth of you know theoretical gains that they would get once Uber eventually went public and of course it did go public but we didn't know at the time when that was going to happen so people would have to be like going out and borrowing a whole bunch of money to pay off the tax liabilities for exercising these options buying a bunch of uber that might never actually be worth anything so a lot of people just walked away from their Uber shares because of that um so you know win and doubt just take money because well you're concentrating your risk right you're already working for the company so your monthtomonth livelihood is tied up in that and you know companies may be like show how much you believe in the company buy a bunch of you know like I If your employer is ever trying to sell you equity in in their own company like I would definitely be like concerned uh I it's a nice to have but it's not not to not to uh uh um displace what you should be paid and so you know like it's not like it's bad but it's just like if you don't have the the the finance sense to make sense of it I just I still don't I'm just terrible at it that I just like forget it let's not do that uh let's let's do what we we know it's going to work and um you know I again I just got away from startups and like my company I don't call it a startup because we don't have any uh investors we don't want investors we don't want to get acquired um there's no it's just like we just want to keep it going and build a large catalog for free stuff and that's that's the goal right like yeah once you take investor dollars you're strapping kind of a time bomb to your back and yeah it's like it's like have you ever seen the movie Speed with Keo Reeves like the if the bus drops below 50 miles an hour it'll explode and kill all the tourists on board and all the working moms and everybody that's on the bus they all trapped on this bus it's like barreling down the highway The Unfinished Highway um in La like that's probably the most unrealistic thing about it that you would actually be able to move 50 miles an hour in LA but um but it's like that like once you take on investor money you're expected to keep the bus going 50 miles an hour and if you go up to 60 boom it's like a ratcheting effect like oh you can't go less than 60 that that you have to keep growing you can only move in One Direction so I definitely think it's it's preent and wise for you to ass to uh investors if you start a charity like free C Camp people literally can't invest and you can't own any Equity so it just completely like simplifies a lot of those decisions one of the reasons I I chose to make free C Camp uh a charity and I donated all the equity that I had I had like I don't know like 90 plus% of the equity uh we didn't never have any in investors or anything so um yeah I just donated that to free C Camp for zero dollars when we got our tax exempt status and uh yeah like since then it's just been really simple we don't have anybody telling us mush mush mush move faster move faster and it sounds like you don't have to worry about that either who are the key State like other than the other Andrew the other treky Canadian uh who who else cares about the decisions you all make like who else is involved I mean we have our small team like I we got Sam we got Cindy we got Peter uh we've had other other other folks that are here but we just keep a a very small small team um you know like if there's no need to grow the team there's there's no reason to right because it's just stuff that you have to maintain down the road so like for instance you know like if we start making uh more money because there's a popular certification doesn't mean that you should upscale and hire more people because what happens when that deflates which is kind of like what we saw with covid or or other or or or or other organizations like that um so you know growth is not important as longevity of the company and Mak making sure that the key people that are here are being taken care of whether that is making sure they have good health insurance good good uh job security um and making sure that you know we can make money while also being honest right so like we're we're te we're we're a forprofit but we operate not very well for profit in the sense that like we make enough right but it's not to the point where it's at the detriment of of the the person like I'm not out here going like hey you have to like you should get certifications and you should get certifications um and try to upsell you like I'll be honest with you I'll be like hey I think that uh this is something you can do and it's very popular and you're going to do it because everyone's telling you to do it I think there's better ways to do it I'm going to make the content at least free and have affordable tier so you can support me so at least you don't waste your money you know what I mean like I just want people to I just want people like you know get a fair like a fair deal or or as as cheap as as cheap as possible if that makes sense yeah terrible business model that does make sense like but you're optimizing for longevity you're not optimizing for having a yacht that's right yeah yeah so I mean obviously certifications are the the key that's what people want it's it's kind of like a a an addition to a university degree if you have a University degree or if you don't have a University degree it's a way of proving competence from some Arbiter um objective Arbiter whether that's Amazon or Microsoft or one CompTIA one of these these other organizations that certifies people it it is like independent verification of your skills um and why certifications in 2024 why are certifications so important in your mind I mean um you know you know my my thought process is that certifications they they are a goalpost so there's something to work towards and they're structured learning um I I would say that I like the idea of certifications I like the idea of of it over diploma programs because they can be more agile uh uh more up toate more practical closer to what the industry wants uh whereas I think that schools um they're under like they like there's regul there's regulations and stuff like how schools have to operate and obviously the reason why certifications came about was because like you you go to a compsite program in my hometown and and they're teaching you uh per from 9 years ago and they don't ever update their curriculum right um and then there's this huge process to update it and so I you know I feel that it Ser service in need um so in in theory I like the idea of certifications but um I think the biggest problem with certifications as of as of today is that um these organizations are in a growth mindset like as of like as of today I found out like adabs laid off hundreds of employees from uh their training certification scene because it wasn't wasn't growing right either monetary whatever stuff and so we saw uh like strange behavior for the last six months where uh we had people like pro pro providing false expectations of what the outcomes of the certifications are so like they don't guarantee jobs but they do definitely get you a foundation of skills that are going to be useful um but I I think there's an issue where you have these organizations and it's not just us all of them um where not all of them but most of them most of them most of them where they are um uh they started out good and they were good for a period of time and now they're getting into territory of like okay now we're just here to get the money um and so I'm not saying stop stop taking certifications like I'm still rolling out like I think like six eight of us refreshes and I still believe in in in the content it's just more like align your expectations and think about how it's going to fit in reaching your goals right so if that makes sense maybe we could start like that's so interesting that you see like changes in the way the certifications are being uh you know essentially put out there maintained like you can't lay off I think you said hundreds of people is it really hundreds of people they said hundreds they said between um they said specifically sales and uh TNC were were the largest cut so we don't really know stands for training and certifications training and certification so they're directly involved for making their shts and providing like uh certifications they said they're going to move towards um on Dem and and work with um other vend like third party vendors but they could call me whenever they want but yeah but yeah those hypothetical third party vendors who uh they're they're so proactive about reaching out to you and involving you right not really well well I think we saw the other day about um what was the project it was uh FFM Peg where they were saying hey you can reach out to us whenever they want they say well maybe the channels aren't you know like I'm like no no they know who I am they can reach out whenever they want there's nothing stopping them so so people take it's like you can't speak up or you can't uh you have to like work a particular way but it's just sometimes it's just they don't want to for whatever reason so yeah yeah well um well one thing I want to talk to you about is just like the various certification you know ecosystems if you will like Microsoft has theirs uh Amazon Google uh I think uh hashy corp hashy corp link Foundation Linux Foundation of course yeah we worked with them who maybe you could rattle off like the big players in the space and um maybe some of the big certifications like just for the sake of every like I I'll take notes and I'll add these in the the notes um I always take notes during these so if you hear like a little keyboard clut it's not me like responding to emails or anything it's like I am furiously taking notes I've already got like four pages of notes from talking with Andrew here so um yeah if you could just r a off like who the players are and what they specialize in I mean we have Tech certification Cloud certifications Network Focus certifications security certifications those are our broad four categories I think I said four um and so you know when things started at least like as far as I remember like there were Tech certifications like the A+ certification and whatever other CompTIA certifications and like even back at like at our family family store back in the late 90s early 2000s those things were important getting an A+ certification especially working computer store people cared about those um we saw other organizations that spun up security Sears um and trying to like ccsp and things I forget the the parent organization but like their their process for accredit Edition was extremely uh involved like you had to uh uh show that you worked in the industry for so many years and you had to have another security expert vouch for you and the exam was broken into two separate parts so like the um uh the evaluation process was extremely extremely involved uh but you knew that you were getting uh very good uh uh people so the CT actually mattered right um I think for a while people talked about that they're saying like they didn't like how hard the requirements were it was considered gatekeeping so be some relaxing in there uh Microsoft always made certifications for years and years um before they weren't role based they were like per per um per techn technology and that was good for a long time but they just oversaturated their their Library they used to be very HandsOn like very lab driven um and it was a really great way to evaluate it but then uh they moved away from that maybe for cost purposes or uh they just over satat to the market and everything has now moved over to role Bas certifications right so I think us us was Ro an example of a role would be devops or site reliability engineer or something exactly like a title like that and so it was eight of us that really kicked that off um and for a while they were they were the leader uh I would say like 20 2014 to 2018 they were they were really uh uh they they really had this new model of like uh like the the certificate like the the the attestment part wasn't as hard you know what I mean it was just like a a multiple choice exam uh the content was short like shorter it was more role based it made sense at the time uh and then we saw Microsoft they started uh moving over to that and when Google wrote uh rulers out they did that as as well and so um you know I think for a while either of us like was was really defining this new new way of of making certifications but um I think as time went on um uh you know the novelty of cloud is worn off uh now we want uh people with like like you're not no one's looking for cloud Consultants anymore everyone knows how like how to work with Cloud now so now they want people with heart attac fundamental skills whether you a developer or uh like a network engineer or something else and then applying that to cloud and so um the uh the bar has not raised in terms of that um testing process like we talked about like those security Sears that were yeah Heavy Hitters and I think there needs to be an adjustment either the expectations of the outcomes of these certifications need to be realized and um be properly promoted not to false expectations or the evaluation process has to change so um do that Mak sense just to kind of recapitulate what you're saying the tests either need to be harder or they need to temper their marketing for what a certification is going to help you achieve either one one or the other right because um you know and it's just I would just say eight of us is is is in the the the hot seat right now whereas Microsoft has made some uh improvements like they have some some select tests they've made it open book so like you can go up to look at the documentation while taking the exam they've brought back some of their Labs um um Microsoft has been really good about like the Azure exams about actually using the tech I would just say the only frustration frustrating part about doing Microsoft exams is that their services are sprawling and so in theory their exams are are uh are well executed it's just that their technolog is a a pain to use in my opinion but um uh you know I I would probably say that Microsoft's doing the best uh with with their like how they're engineering their certification and their curriculum and and the issues they're having is not necessarily the exams it's more just the nature of of the state of their products because they're so rapid developing right like they're they're out there and like I just imagine them in a boardroom trying to like get a sale from like a school or or something else and they go around the table everyone says has to have this has to have has to have that and they go okay it has all that stuff and then they roll up those products and so their stuff is a bit more mishap but it does work in the end that's always been Microsoft forever do you know what I mean so there's like a totally different culture from Amon in terms of getting things done even though they're like located just a few miles from one another their headquarters and stuff yeah but but it like Microsoft's fast and loose but it works and like this comes back to like fixing computers like we remember like they would roll out their OS and then you're just like every month you're doing patches because they're fixing things because they just won't stop rolling stuff out but they're meeting the business demands of the organizations and even if it's not immediately they eventually do right and that's why there's such a juggernaut these days yeah yeah yeah I mean is it's been impressive just how uh I mean considering how much of a lead aw's had over Microsoft just Microsoft coming in really strong with Azure um yeah it's definitely an exciting company to watch uh to to see the decisions they make and like analyze them in terms of I'm an individual I want to earn some certifications like most of the people probably listening to this are not in control of like a a giant Cloud company trying to like figure out like what a cloud certification strategy might look like most of them are on the other side of it they're devs who want to earn some certifications and want to be able to uh ramp up their earning power ramp up their opportunity in terms of being able to get progressively more advanced roles in security or network engineering or uh you know Cloud engineering maybe you could talk a little bit about what these certifications can do for you in terms of how they can you know help in those regards I think they I think they lay out like a good road map in terms of or of the landscape of what you need to cover because once you cover something like let's say infrastructure is a code and you've done it in a few different iterations like terraform cloud formation whatever you have that skill right so no matter if Alibaba Cloud says hey we have a new product or there's like a spinoff like like uh Hashi Corp terraform got forked with open tofu or uh you know there's some like thing that's like a control plane that's similar to I the idea is that you have enough transfer uh transferable knowledge to uh to be dangerous and I do feel like there there is a certain amount of knowledge you need to gain over a period of time whether it's three or six years and every year you can tackle something different so like even through my career like uh you know even though I was building apps like it like and I was and I had like a team of developers and uh you know we had like a good amount of uh of users and and traffic or whatever um you know I would still have like a um like like blind spots like I was just like wasn't really good at optimizing SQL and I'm like this is the year I'm going to spend two three months and get really deep SQL knowledge and that never leaves me it's like early in my career it's like I invested that time learning regex right and um now I I get to keep that skill for the rest of my life do I remember all the the details of it no but I I have confidence with it and I I feel that every different type of certification Microsoft all the ones that we've been doing they're there's just like they're they're taking they're covering a part of the pie and so once you've done them you've done them in few different iterations you are now equipped to do anything you want to do like tomorrow if I want to be a data like a data engineer I can go do it if tomorrow I want to beor I can go do it because there's so much overlap of these skills um and so you know I I think that um you know certifications aren't the most efficient way to cover that that landscape of stuff but it's all there right and so if you just keep chipping away at it eventually you'll you'll have all the knowledge and you'll have that Mobility we had we ran a boot camp for was it terraform um uh like the terraform boot camp recently and we used GitHub as the platform and I I did something that I didn't do in the last boot camp was I I made everyone do poll requests um and wow I did not realize how many how many people like in the tech industry that are like in not necessarily developer roles but they're in like it networking or Cloud networking or security like their minds exploded because they didn't realize that they had this huge like missing Gap uh like just like working with GitHub or like just working with code um and so you know there's always these uh like if you can if you can get good coverage of of the fundamentals you're going to be dangerous no matter what you do right 100% I just want to emphasize like I I'll get on my soap box for a moment I think every developer every developer in 2024 should learn the following seven things at least you know dangerous as you said earlier like like you know the saying is you master the fundamentals you never really have to come back to them you've got that Foundation upon which you can build other things you've got all that knowledge that you can use as scaffolding to like Branch out and you know web in other knowledge into your uh inter your kind of like mind map sorry I'm mixing all kinds of metaphors there but I tell everybody you should learn you know HTML CSS JavaScript python Linux git and SQL and I tell people like if you learn those seven Technologies like uh you're going to basically you're you're going to have at least two scripting knowled languages that you know that are very different and their application to different tool ecosystems and stuff Python and JavaScript but you're also going to know databases you're also going to know operating systems you're also going to know Version Control and then HTML CSS are just convenient to know because you never know when you're going to need to build a quick user interface and everything like like even like electron I was talking with Jessica Lord who helped uh who founded the electron team at GitHub like every desktop app that like you launch probably on your desktop these days is probably not everyone but most of them make use of electron and what is that that's just HTML CSS and JavaScript running on a native app like on Windows or on on Mac right yeah um um so there was a uh I actually have deep knowledge on like implementing electron apps because it was like 2017 2018 I built a uh one of my favorite video games is um called um Tetris attack for the Super Nintendo probably love or pen pawn in Japan yep it's it's a high skill game it's deceptively High skill I spent way too much time trying to like get like the the combo system you're saying we could be playing right now any anyway well next time and I get together in person we're going to throw down on some Tetris attack I've got it on my SNES classic I uh uh I I think I it might come stock with it or I modded it but it should yeah yeah it's a great game um but uh so so um uh uh there's a Discord group where uh people play competitively and so I I join that I'm not not as good as they are but um you know they they play with emulators but there's a little bit of delay even with retroarc and so um um I was trying to build a competitor one for the market there was another one that got built in Python that beat me out um and I I got busy I actually before I was doing this that's what I wanted to do I wanted to build a a competitive game of of um Tetris attack but then I ended up building this company um and so I I learned how I learned how to read assembly code for the SNES for the ROM so that I could figure exactly like frame per frame the movements because if the if it didn't have exact frame per frame per mov then they wouldn't competitively play it and so I was basically cloning that and I I built the app in electrona typescript and it it worked pretty well but where I got stuck was um doing the multiplayer so I just I I had an estate where I'm working through U multiplayer and I had to build a simpler Tetris game just to try to figure out the uh the latency issues or like the miscommunication is issues I was having but that's just sitting there and it's postponed definitely it's not done like it's not cancelled but at some point I'll come back yeah and I'll I'll finish that game oh man it's just warm my heart knowing that you're like literally trying to recreate Tetris attack in a you know contemporary environment NE code FR frame for frame yeah yeah and and with Competitive Gaming like probably a lot of people watching this who are in the fighting game Community or something like people literally memorize how much frame every different type of punch in Tekken has or or in Street Fighter because like it all matters like you're you're doing all kinds of calculations in your mind to figure out like whether a combo will work whether it's safe to do a certain move in a certain situation and with Tetris attack like you really have to plan out like like your hands have to move really quick and stuff but also you your mind has to work really quick your eyes have to work really quick and you don't want to be playing on your original SNES and then jumping on like an online client and have the Frame data be even slightly different otherwise it completely throws off your game right uh and people people want that experience there's like what's called classic Tetris on NES I don't know if you have heard about this but people are still playing Tetris on NES like 30 40 years later after the release date um but basically that's the canonical version that everybody plays on the on the original one player uh NES not the Tangen twoplayer unauthorized Tetris I have the tetris uh movie downloaded though I can't wait to watch that by the way just saw my long list of things to do when I have time but yeah like Frank every frame matters every like making your emulator like especially if it's a competitive game making it exactly um how the original game is is vital or people just will not give it any time of day right that's like table Stakes it is it has to play exactly the same but uh and I was just thinking I'm almost at the point where I can come back to that game so like what and I had a whole team around it it was it was really interesting because I always want to make video games but if you find the right video game that people want want to be made the community will just like materialize so I had like a gra like a a pixel artist and a person that uh that made music and there it was really coming together it's just again it's like couldn't get there in time and uh but I'm almost at a point where I can revisit it and I just as of last week I was spinning up mono game or G mono game mono game which is a um it's an open source um engine uh so it's like writing Unity code except that you if you can if you you could Port it to any uh console and uh you don't have to pay any licensing fees and so I had to rush up on my net skills I was very tempted to make a c c course because my C skills are like really sharp right now but um uh it's just it's like it's fun because in Tech it's like whatever I learn is always transferable right so um you know I spent all that time learning different programming languages and you know one day I'm writing typescript the other day I'm writing C another day I'm writing Java and so again comes back to those seven core skills like you said JavaScript the point is just to get started in in those things and if you get started in those seven things you have all those starting points you just grow those all up right then you're going to be in really good shape um so even if they they seem like trivial like HTML and CSS seem trivial that's not the point the point is is that they're your Stepping Stones to get started right yeah I mean arithmetic may seem trivial but without it you can't do any of the higher math right you or like it's like I wanted to um like I'm coding a prototype gape in mono in in mono game because I uh I want to learn the engine and figure out the the architecture of how I'm going to build my game before I come back to my Swap and pop game yeah and uh while I'm building I'm building a shoot them up because that's like the classic that's in the background to you that you have there bullet hell Shooters so so I'm building a shum up where it's it's it's grocery store theme because I'm always uh I'm always fighting with grocery stores and so um I can you elaborate you're always fighting with grocery stores I I I live in I live in um remote towns and uh the grocery store here is just like pitiful because they they can charge more and the produce isn't great it's not all their F fault because in Canada we have I don't know if the word is uh uh monopolies orop there just a few sell just a few so so there's like there's L Blas and soes and there's Maybe like one from que you think they collude to keep prices High I don't know about I don't think so I mean in certain things they do in certain things like bread there was the bread fixing uh scam of of Canada seriously wow seriously bread is such an important staple like that's scandalous like we talk about white collar crime and stuff but like PE families rely on bread for literal sustenance way back to Rome way back to Egypt right like that that is just like if there's ever something that should be price protected it's bread you know what you know you know how much bread I buy per month cuz I have three young kids like uh six five four and two something like that and anyway so like they sandwich bread is like the biggest staple in my house I wish they would eat rice they just won't eat rice and so I literally buy 40 loaves like this big of of whole wheat bread every single month I drive two hours I just did a trip just yesterday that's why we couldn't do the podcast yesterday I did the bread run the bread milk run and like in town it sells for $4 almost $5 and it's like half the size and if I go into to Thunder Bay it at the whole whole Wholesale Club it's like 218 for twice the size yeah and so it adds up right and so I even learned how to like people are watching my like on my Twitter they were probably wondering like why I was so obsessed with making bread the last few months cuz I'm trying to offset my bread cloths and I'm not even kiding W so there's a pract it's not like some hobby that like rich people get really interested in yeast all of a sudden it's like literal like this is costing a fortune well it's just like I don't want to like I want to have selfsufficient skills so I don't go to the the local place and and the it's like partly their fault for overpricing but the other thing is like if you look at if you look at their supplier like their food comes from Family Foods which comes from uh McDonald's Corporation not like McDonald's the the restaurant but like McDonald's the guy named McDonald or something which then comes from soes right and then they set the prices so like there's nothing like if you're a grocery store you have to get your food from somewhere it's going to come from BL Blas it's going to come from soes and there's only so much Flex you have with price yeah I mean like they're passing they have to pass on some cost and they have to have some margin for themselves so the more middlemen you have I guess the price of bread just kind of explodes for the Inc consumer along the way but um but uh that's why I'm kind of like that's why I was making a grocery store like there's two games I I always want to make it's it's uh swap pop which is the uh Tetris attack competitive well in Tetris attack you have two blocks like you have a cursor and you swap the position of two blocks horizontally your only form of interaction right Swap and pop they pop when you get three or four or three in a row vertically or horizontally so so I want to make that my other game is I always wanted to make a grocery store simulator which is like you have like a you have you open a grocery store and you have to you have to manage the inventory and the employees and the visual layout of the store and then you have to deal with competing grocery stores because like in Canada like in my hometown Thunder Bay there was smaller grocery stores that were doing really well and the grocery stores kept trying to buy them out and there was a few where like their familyowned that I know them and and the family regrets not selling out because it's like their whole family lost out on a bunch of money because they ran them in they ran the competition out right so they they were growing they were having multiple stores and then they now they're back to just one store and uh you know it's just the nature of things so I don't know it's just it is what it is but like that's that's my obsessions with these particular things yeah man there was like a I think it was like Bloomberg or something Mall Simulator game browser oh yeah there there's uh yeah uh shopping Tycoon management I I can't remember but there was this newspaper that put together this this really cool like it had pixel art and Chip tune music and everything and it was like a simulation of what it's like to run a mall and of course it's like a nightmare because it's basically um like your tenants are having to move out because malls are not profitable and this was all preo of course uh so there's like even a subreddit like dead malls or abandoned malls or something where people like break into these like you know malls that have basically been like condemned and like explore and Splunk around in like the mold covered you know old movie theaters and stuff is they wear like Hazmat masks and stuff when they go in there but uh yeah like definitely I I can definitely see that being a terrible business to be in in 2024 and making a game about the plight of grocery store owners would be really cool just from like a kind of uh anthropological perspective and also From anolog perspective because I worked in grocery stores like I I didn't have like a cool Mom I mean my mom's very cool but she didn't run like a cool you know business where I could be fixing computers and stuff uh I I would go to the grocery store all the time as a kid and like check out VHS tapes and then later I worked for like two years at grocery store like I show up at 6 a.m. and like mop the entire floor and then I go stock and face the shelves and uh put all the big cardboard boxes into the trash compactor and try not to get my arm caught in there so I didn't have some like childhood industrial accident you know like um I have a lot of nostalgia for just walking around and hearing like you know Kenny G or whatever playing and and like the the FL some bulbs above so I I would definitely play that game if you make it well there's just so many I just there's just so many systems that you can think about in there like what happens when you introduce self checkout what happens when there's like an event like Co what happens when there is a competitor think about like every person that goes through that store like how far do they live to the store uh like all all the attributes of those of those people in simulating that like I like when you go to G where you put Food Matters so like there's a there's an optimization where it's like there's food at the eye level of like there's what at the eye level kids like you put stuff that that catch your attention that's where you put the sugar cereal right cereal like the stuff that you like that's cheap that would save people money but you don't want to buy you put on the bottom shelf the most expensive stuff that is like luxury you put on the top and then like there's like the the the one that's just right below there like there's all these little optimizations you go into the grocery store you smell flowers you feel like oh everything smells good then you see the produce you go everything's Fresh then you go to the bulk you like oh there's good deals they have bulk stuff here there's so pricing in everything too is like a huge deal because you know you can put everything half off or whatever you can get a membership card like then the people that are not members will be all cranky they have to pay like six bucks for a little thing of Greek yogurt instead of paying like four 450 or something right um so you're like pushing people into your to your Rewards program also like one thing I have no idea if this had an impact but if you think about cigarettes right like uh cigarettes were a massive to some they still are in the United States and probably in Canada they're big up here they're like remote towns they're huge right I me think about smokes They Don't Really perish like cigarettes are fresh I guess is fresh as like a cancer stick can be for like probably at least two or three years you can probably have that Carton and it's still consumable right and you have this little carton that costs like 20 bucks or however much cigarettes cost these days and uh it's like 20 or it's like 10 packs and it barely takes up any space it's very lightweight it's probably super easy to transport and that was probably like a huge Cash Cow for grocery stores in like the' 60s 7s 80s because you've got all these people that are addicted that smoke like an entire pack a day and they're just coming into your grocery store and it's a reason to get people to come back into your grocery store regularly too I mean like selling milk the margins on milk and bread are not nearly as high as they are on like cigarettes and stuff like that so I imagine that's also decimated this is total speculation by the way and and and thank goodness that the the tobacco industry is in Decline I'll just say I'll just share this anecdote Camel cigarettes when I was a kid and you know I made bad decisions like I smoke camel because Joe Camel you know the cool like James Bond of uh cigarette mascots right and uh so cool yeah Camel cigarettes just that brand Alone 6 million dead Americans 6 million people who died prematurely before their time because of camel so yeah if there's ever been an evil industry it like no question like the most evil industry ever was the cigarette industry anyway I'll I'll end that little uh that little Soap Box thing but but it just blows my mind like there was it it had to be like a bonanza like the the input cost it had to be like the greatest industry of all time uh in terms of just like how little work needed to be done and how much money was like enjoyed by the people who were I guess putting those products out there uh and how little of the cost was actually borne by the companies and how much of it was born by Society in the form of tax that we had to pay to help people who have like 50 pack years or whatever uh year of smoking cigarettes it's called a pack year that have accumulated like all these chronic diseases or you know even uh you know lung cancer anyway sorry this is not a public health podcast but I just felt like talking about that because cuz for me it's like therapeutic to talk about the fact that like I got taken in by this industry and like there was like a year or so that I year or two that I was smoked as a as a kid like as a like young teenager like 13 14 years old 15 years old right and um yeah anyway I hope I hope you never smoked and I I hope that none of our kids ever smoke I mean I worked in a bingo hall for years but like that was the closest you could say I smoked but no it's uh no asthma I'm not I'm not I'm notok for anything right you dodge a bullet with your asthma I hope your asthma's okay sorry I don't want me to that yeah it's fine but um you know like building these games aren't a waste they've always they've like any pass passion project I've buil I've always been able to turn into work so you know um markety which was one of my earliest applications I built I I flipped into like my earliest uh like uh uh contracts because people wanted something similar of what it was like Swap and pop that game in particular which is interesting I was just building it for fun but uh you know I I had worked at a previous um ettech startup and um you know I left I left and I interviewed at other edtech startups in Toronto that were education education focused and you know some of them I came pretty close to getting hired but uh um uh you know they they passed for whatever reason but like I took that project that Swap and pop and there was like an organization that was that was an edtech company and they would have hack and tells and you go there and you show off your what you do hack inel so it's like show Intel but hack something together in yeah so you say hey look at this cool project this is how I built it and they walk you walk through the technical stuff it was just it was it was a guys for hiring for this tech company um because they they would give you an award right like a gift certificate or whatever um but really what they were trying to do was hire the best talent and so I i' show this project and I like I like I one hands down because who's who's like going through and breaking down assembly code for a Super Nintendo game to make frame by frame stuff built in an electron app with whatever like talking about like why typescripts good and working with teams I didn't I didn't realize like when you're building a game and you have like four or five other people working on it it's like you need to know where everything is it's not the same as building web apps um and so you know they they they wanted to approach me and hire me I said you already had the chance to hire me you weren't interested but it just like but it's was just like how much of a magnet that project was um and so like any project like even if I was like building this Sim for let's say I was building Simulator for a grocery store like you you have to like I'm basically building uh there's software out there for inventory management and stuff like that for grocery stores do you know what I mean like I'm basically building that stuff um so I always find that you can flip that into work and that's a great way of you know whatever you're building like and people are worried about AI I'm not really worried about it that much like large companies should be like people working in large companies like ads Google whatever should like should be worried because they they know how to utilize it and streamline their uh their uh their Workforce to best utilize it these small companies don't yeah do you know what I mean so there's still lots of opportunity for work there's some there's some people out there saying like oh I I cut back on my customer support okay but they're not cutting out their Tech roles do you know what I mean so um and was it Devon is Devon the thing that yeah I keep hearing about it but I think a lot of it's probably Grassroots or what's it called astroturfing like people pretending to be developers like overstating it there's so much hypee out there but but the thing is what percentage they said like there's like they said there's a percentage of like that it was a percentage that they said that they could complete tasks that like GitHub issues they said it was like 13.9% I'm just like okay but we need 100% and then some so even even if they got 100% it still doesn't matter and a lot of those tasks are probably just like updating the copyright date in the footer and stuff like that like simple stuff that like you and I could probably do with our eyes closed that uh yeah it's cool it's definitely helpful that these tools are out there but I feel like everybody's just swept up in so much hype we could we could talk about this for a long time because like I I I you know like I listen to like interviews with like you know AI luminaries and stuff like that and they're like you don't need to learn to code anymore I'm like dude you're talking your own book you're basically trying to convince people that your product is like the next thing since the best thing since sliced bread since we were talking about earlier a Ty um like V it's like talking about VR or yeah I mean like yeah we'll see we will see but I would if I were uh you know somebody getting into code right now the last thing I would be doing is listening to what you know Jensen hang the founder yeah telling people you don't need to learn code anymore yeah right I I don't know any senior developers who are getting work done who many of whom use tools like copilot or have probably tried Devon uh that that that way like it's just interestingly it's just the people selling the the software that is supposed to be able to replace developers or people selling the hardware that it's supposed to be able to build you know train the models that are going to replace the software developers that are talking like this the actual developers don't feel this way I mean like I would I would use it tomorrow if like you be you'd see me making courses tomorrow on it if that was the case and I'm not saying like it's not worth your time to learn there's definitely there there are tools that you can utilize and you use AI tools I just want to emphasize that oh yeah I do a lot so so one of the thing maybe you could talk about some of your tools cuz first of all you've been a a very aggressive and early adopter of AI tools you know Bo who runs the Freo cam Channel whom you and I talk with all the time he uh he uses whisper um also from open AI to he's working on some scripts to like automatically have really high quality captions in English and which then feed into YouTube's Auto translations so they improve the the quality of translations by the way if anybody's watching this I really wish I could watch this with Arabic subtitles you can you can just click the gear and it's like three or four clicks they really bury it switch it to English and then switch to uh then once you've switched it to English like autogenerated or English if there's captions for this then you can switch it again and you can do auto translate you can have pretty good like uh I like we we did Auto translate into Japanese the other day in Yoko on our team she was watching and she's like oh this is pretty good like this is not bad at all considering it's just kind of on the Fly translating but uh obviously we're using whisper for that but like you've used AI like voice cloning talk about some of the AI tools you've used yeah so I mean I mean I think that that's probably the one that sticks out the most which was thei the um the synthetic AI voice and the reason I had to do that was because I was losing my voice uh it's called um muscle tension dysphonia uh so there's one where it's it's like you wear it out the other ones it's like it's degenerative and so like I have like degenerative voice loss if I keep straining my voice and not utilizing it properly it just has to do with uh the predisposition of predis it's just you know genetics right genetics and and uh but anyway the point was is that there was a point where like I could not talk for like six months and I was like well I can't stop making courses and so I I literally went through like I don't know how many uh like voice products uh to Sy and even try to run my own model to make a synthetic voice and eventually I you know I I got a voice that worked but it's not just getting the voice it's getting the workflow with your technology because like a lot of these things don't make it easy to like type it out and then download the part of it and then sync it up so we had to um figure out the right voice that would sync up with our workflow and then we had to figure out how to um there was like another part was like we were trying to do like uh trying to figure out okay we have the voice can we do video as well because I hate it being on on screen right yeah I just hate I I found that I would I would it would take me like you know that like 30 second 15c video I make in the beginning beginning of the the things all day every single time I got a teleprompter I got everything it takes all day to do 30 seconds because I'm I'm terrible at that well people I think most people are terrible at I'm terrible at it too uh which is one of the reasons I don't even like use any sort of teleprompter or anything like that like for the intros I just practice practice practice practice practice uh just to try to get it down to when I can do it on my sleep like the like the baselines I practice those I don't know hundreds of times before I attempt to perform at the beginning of the uh the podcast just because uh being able to perform on the spot there's always something that you're not completely happy with like recording that audio book I I wrote a book last year I recorded the entire thing that took me like two weeks of like just sitting there with a microphone reading it saying no I didn't get it right let me redo it and then going back and editing all that and it's probably twice as bad when you have video just because like maybe like I don't like the way I like delivered that line and I can't just do a nice cut because there's going to be jump in the video too right actually editing video it's obvious where the edits are with with sound you can get away with like less uh I guess you can do more editing with sound than you can with sound and video back to the ey like back in 2018 or whenever 2016 I always forget when we our company started but whenever we started it like I had an like I already had an AI bot that would that would analyze how students would study and make recommendations uh we stopped running that because we needed to rebuild it and the issue was once we started branching outside of AD bus it became you needed like a specialized um model per like per like family of certifications right so so we had that for a while um I'm trying to think uh we were trying to do like generate our PowerPoint slides so like we have a we have like a huge collection of uh like a huge library of slides and there's this huge issue of like when you have to update them it's like I was trying to make it so like it would generate out the code that I needed and just like make the slides for me and so you know I'm I'm not saying we're having 100% success with these tools but I'm just saying that we're constantly trying to experiment and try to automate our pipeline so we can stay as small as we can and we can expand me the brand because the hardest thing in this industry is getting other creators to create content with you at the same like the same standard right so like I know other people that make great content like can you make make it like me no I I make it my own way and I have my own curriculum development and I have my own production standards and stuff like that um and and then it's like even like can they deliver the same timeline and stuff like that it doesn't always line up right so it's so hard um and you can be dumping money at people and they still they still like ah they get 75% of the way they're like ah it's not for me do you know what I mean so it's this is this it's very hard you wouldn't think it is but it's very hard to have some of the skill sets and the stuff to do this and so you know I we made the determination that we're just going to scale me virtually um it's not to say like where we're we're tricking people because it's still me it's just like if I can't use my voice you wrote every word that is being said it's just that you know you you don't necessarily have the voice to be able to say and you don't want to spend like an entire day in front of a teleprompter starting over reading you know but you know what it's like my my AI voice it you can tell it's not me because I'm I'm not stumbling or I'm not going ums or stuff like that and so people people like I I would say they're getting so good I think I have to generate a new voice because there's a newer model that is even more realistic like you would not you would not know that it was me like my older one sound like I have like a mild cold but like nobody complained um and I'm not like and I would intermix I would shoot videos like where it seems like a little more livelier because now I'm in the video right so like if there's some really important stuff you'll you'll hear me but depends on the course but you know most most of the time it's me um but there are there are some courses that are um like we just want to fill in our catalog we want to get the content out and it's content that would never get made if it wasn't for voice because it's just like I don't I can't I can't give my voice to that stuff so I wouldn't I just again I don't feel like I'm cheating people but I noticed like YouTube was saying recently that and I think we talked about this earli when I first started doing I said like hey I should label saying this is a synthetic voice because eventually they're going to ask people to to do that and yeah we we had a discussion with with YouTube's you know team yeah last week about this like we don't believe that we should have to label things that are just you know humans that that are actual creators doing I think like obviously if I'm trying to pretend that I'm some celebrity and like putting words in their mouth that should be labeled just like you know this contains like AI you know generated speech or something but I don't think if if I'm using AI which I've never used it but I will I will say real quick very excited about this there's going to be a voice cloning um course that we're publishing ly Lyn Jung on our team who's created like the stable diffusion course and some other things she has taken my uh the Corpus of audio from me reading my audio book and she's created a really good voice model that and I can speak like German I I can't speak a word of German but you can hear Quincy speak you know Flawless German are are you saying that they could TR they could do translation with my ality and another yeah they can like wrap they the way it works is they build the model and then they kind of like wrap it around like some recorded speech so if there's like a weather report they can basically just have me say with the same intonation and every but it's my voice instead of you know the the weather lady's voice I've been trying to get somebody like I I've been trying to just so many times trying to get people to make like a Spanish version of my or something and and I'll I'll hand them all the material and they're like yes I want to do this whatever we'll even pay them can't get done no matter what ly could help you with that because we have a Spanish free Cod Camp Channel we could definitely publish some of your shirts in Spanish now generally like people like to learn from somebody who speaks their language whose culture but they're never making it so what's you know what I'm saying like it's true I mean long time it's a matter it's not a matter of like I wouldn't give it to somebody else it's like like look at my boot camp it was 100 hours who's going to translate that who nobody nobody you're right there is some work that just has to be done by machines just because humans ain't got time for that right well and you know like originally like I was going to I was going to learn Spanish like I I used to live in Spain so I had some some level of Competency in Spanish and so I was going to go and brush it up and everyone's like oh no no don't do that and I was like but why not no no one will do it for me and they're like no you should get a Spanish person like but no Spanish person will do it for me even though they say they will even with money no matter what so it's just kind of like like um but uh I don't know is hard to find well I mean it's it's just it it's it's just hard um and uh you know I don't know it's it's just hard I mean it's the work is hard like it's not it's not like you being a a mean person whatever it's just like this this role of conton creation is a grind and people do not realize that you get 90% done and then there's 90% more to do and then there's 90% more to do and then there's 90% packaging and then 90% uh marketing and you just feel you just want to be done and over with it and quit every time every course I mean what are we trying to do we're trying to take your expertise your knowledge of cloud computing of the certifications having gone drilled prepared past them or intentionally failed them and uh like like that lived experience that that knowledge that's in your head and break it out into hundreds of PowerPoint slides and walk through all the concepts walk through all the terminology walk through all the ways that like a certain type of technology is slightly different from others find the parallels like I mean your courses the the certification Prep course they could be like a dozen hours of just for one certification right um we just want that expertise and we want everybody will to have that so they can go past this these exams they can earn these certifications they can go out and win in the job market and they can uh get better jobs have more opportunity than they would have had without these certifications right like it's all a means to an end and that end is having families that can afford to put bread on the table Yeah so but um uh back to AI like AI generation for like like I like to use little icons to sprw stuff up so it's like instead of going to Flat icon I can just be like hey give me an SVG icon of something unique and so uh I think that that removes some of some of some of those things before you had to purchase those assets um AI grading so we we built out validators originally with the intent to have it AI graded um because when you are trying to evaluate whether people are doing doing work it's basically just pull apis that bring back Json and say does it look like they set this thing up right and AI could do that but the problem was is that uh the token the token window wasn't large enough to analyze window context window sure it might be now but I'd have to go back to it and so it depends on the the model but like I think like GPT 4 Turbo has like a much larger contact windso CLA has like a really large context window um you can fit like an entire code base into that but you know but even still was like we ended up just having and I just thought about it more I was just like it wasn't hard to write Jason validators that said okay did this show up in the code and so we do have like that was one of the outcomes of the boot camps was like we now have validators for everything almost um which is exciting um but anyway yeah that was another another uh example of uh validation but when we did the boot camp uh we did we're talking about the AWS boot camp the big one tell us just like for people who've never heard about this AWS boot camp it's like 95 hour video or something like that maybe more than 100 hours so like it was a 100 hour video but like there was more to it than that like people went okay I can finish this in 100 hours and said no no no no no no you don't understand this was done over the scope of four to five months so yes you're watching the videos but like whatever you're watching it's three times the labor so like you're putting like 300 400 hours of working in fact today I actually have to do this later but there's somebody that just said hey I wasn't part of the boot camp when it ran but I just finished it all 100% Andrew can you please go grade me and Mark it over even though I'm outside of it and they did all the work so I'm going to go after this call I'm going to go um uh even though it's out of scope I'm going to go I'm going to go that's really chill so you you actually look at their work and it so there are actual deliverables there are projects this is Project oriented learning right so so for that one what I wanted to do was I wanted to uh uh if anybody got to a certain checkpoint I would grade them so we had I think it was like what was it I'm going to go look at the website for the signups since I forget it'll it'll come back to me for Aus Cloud project boot camp adus cloudro bootcamp.com uh we had 10,000 students enrolled but we actually had a list of 50,000 backlogged 50,000 people who wanted the ticket who couldn't take it just because we had to you didn't have the manpower to capacity there was actually there was a reason for it and it had had to do I think with what was the there was a capacity limit at exactly 10,000 oh so like originally what we were going to do is we were going to see if we could have everyone in sandbox accounts and there was like a hard limit of 10,000 is what we determined based on something like at dat bu or something there was some kind of metric I can't remember what it was but there was there was a hard limit of 10,000 we we didn't end up using that system we we did Manual grading so what I found was that every single week we had people that dropped off because um it's hard to do something for that period of time at that level complexity and that's actually just normal for um for uh for Education you always expect to lose 40% per week yeah that's a guarantee me it's like even the best courses of all time on like corsera like uh Stanford's own like course platform have like two 3% completion rate you know free C Camp has a very low completion rate frankly a lot of people uh their eyes are bigger than their stomachs when it comes to doing hundreds of hours of or they or they get to where they need to get to right like it's not necessarily it's it's just like right it's like working out it's like you get you get some kind of level of skill but anyway like when you do it for that long um it will down from like from 10,000 to um I'd say a thousand near completion with a 100 core people that like really finished it yeah and so um that was fine like that was actually good numbers uh for for what it was and you know like when you say how you going to grade 10,000 people I didn't have to grade 10,000 people I had to grade um thousand people and then 100 people really well yeah right um and I really enjoyed it I got really fat even though I had lost a lot of weight I lost a lot of weight again I'm losing weight right now again just because stress of like grading all these people uh no no no no no no no it's just I no it's just um but anyway it's just well I mean you said you got really fat what do you mean I well because I was here like right now I'm in standing but like I was sitting all day every day taking calls every single day I didn't have time to prepare good meal good meals because I was like we were making it we were we made the course like I sorry I made the I we were making a product like a um a social media platform I clone of Twitter right and I didn't plan it ahead it wasn't like I it was all stage it was like we're building something for real and we'll we'll have class this week and then throughout the week I have to make it right so it was like we had a general idea what we wanted to build but it was it was um we say build the as we cross it uh and it led to a very unique experience that I don't know if I could replicate again because uh I didn't make any money off of it not that so how much did the boot camp cost to attend uh nothing it was free it was 100% free for for for students like not free for me not free for you did you have sponsors how did you make it work uh we sorry we had a couple sponsors so we had uh like a we cloud data which is a um a school in Toronto they're like super nice Adrian krill who's my competitor SP sponsored me he was very generous um you wouldn't think that he would sponsor maybe he's trying to push you in an early grave overing you yeah right he's oh no he's go for do a lot of these no he's a good guy's he's like he's just jokeing I'm sure he's a good guy I just but um um I thought we had another sponsor but yeah it was like there was no it was at the time where all these layoffs were happening so people said they said Andrew you're going to have the easiest time getting sponsors and then all of a sudden everyone's like we can't get sponsorship for anything yeah like there like like there's there's events where people have like 500 people and they'll they'll get like $200,000 in sponsorship and I I I had sponsorship like 20 30 and and and and we we like we out of pocket our company xam Pro was like $70,000 right so it wasn't like it was free it cost me money and uh you know we we kind of made it up when we did the terraform boot camp so we had to do a hybrid thing with the terraform boot camp and it kind of It kind of alleviated that but really like this cost of the booth Camp came from me making all the courses the free courses that we published at free Cod camp and people optionally paying for the additional materials which they don't need to pass let's talk about exam Pro's business model I I definitely want to talk about uh you know your terraform uh boot camp and things like and you use the term boot camp a lot of people think coding boot camp like boot camps have actually existed I think back since since the bubble like it's it's considered a newer phenomenon but the idea of basically having like something quick to quickly help somebody acclimate to a new field a new category of skills that they're trying to acquire right uh so a boot camp doesn't necessarily need to be like oh I paid $20,000 and I study for 16 weeks or something like that that's like what it was during the the height of the boot camp craze and like 2014 20 through 2018 maybe that's about right yeah between that but like examp Pro you publish you know huge video courses uh on fre Cod Camp dozens of them on pretty much every cloud certification you can imagine like entire ecosystems like all the AWS you know categories of certifications and it makes people mad too like other conon creators it makes them mad because that they they say um it's not that problem anymore but at one point that uh Conor creators believed that I was um uh uh running running everything to the ground because if if I release the videos for free then who's going to buy a paid course that's just videos you have to do something additional to it and it turns out people will still pay for people love spending money like people still use udemy and and pay $25 for a course that they're never going to actually watch because it feels good to buy to walk into a bookstore and buy a book because it feels like you're buying the time to actually read that book people people people love to like Express their intentions and their aspirations through purchasing well it's like a hot dog too right like like you want ketchup mustard and relish on and and different people bring different perspectives right so there's there's room for more than like people think like I'm worried about other competitors it depends like if if somebody's trying to do exactly the same thing in the exact funnel at the exact time as me that's a problem but if we were friends and we coordinate and they going and this lot people don't know this like a lot of the creators in the space were all F like a lot of us are friends some of us were very antagonistic early on it was very problematic but a lot of us like we like we get out of the way of each other right so that we we both can do well and be we're technical competitors but we can we can both do well and uh it's usually an issue when there's just like there's some people that are just like they're just they just want to yeah make the most and do everything right and I I look like that because I do a bit of everything but I don't really cause that much damage in in these areas if a lot of you doing everything is just because you're intellectually very curious and you love learning about these new technologies and taking these exams like you're like an exam nerd or like certification nerd in the way that like daal Shaw who runs class Central is obsessed with massive open online courses from like Stanford and MIT and stuff like he he sleeps and breathes this he goes to conferences where he just talks he's just giddily excited about this and you give me the same Vibe as far as technical certifications um so one thing one question I have for you the way exam Pro works the way that you're able to publish all this content for free on YouTube on the free Cod Camp Channel and still you know buy expensive bread to give to your kids uh and put gas in your car for a twohour road trip every time you want to get groceries um like like how does exam Pro actually work like what kind of additional things can people buy on exam pro. we like the idea is that we believe that there should be a base level that's free like the videos so that even if you can't afford anything you can pass right you should you should be able to fill the gaps yourself so everything is is like it's it's almost kind of like the the Cosmetics of of DLCs and video games or I shouldn't say that're they're more useful than that but it's like um it would be like we always give a free practice exam so that's our our trick to get you to come to the platform is like we live we always say come to the platform get the free practice exam you go there and then we have downloadable the these are the pain things downloadable slides downloadable cheat sheets um better better digestible content because we put it on freeo Camp as the big video and that's intentional because we want to create a like just a little bit of friction and if you go to our platform you can watch the videos individualize yeah and you can actually there's like a pretty cool like workflow where you like click through and everything's broken out into different like if if if anybody's ever taken a course on like um educative or class classify or something I can't remember the names of these different platforms but they're they're basically like you can just pay a fee to like have this and you can put your site on that but you have all custom and it's much better than those in my experience because you've like gone through and like engineered everything so you you you progress through the different things and you get like stars moving across if I if I recall correctly yep yep yeah so it's it's like a an incredibly wholesome like productive learning environment for people who have a very clear goal I want to pass the AWS uh whatever certified Cloud practitioner or the devops one of the harder ones right which whatever is the yeah whatever of the nine or 12 whichever certifications so maybe you talk about like the the pricing and like how much it costs obviously this is not an ad for exam Pro but I'm actually I'm just curious about these things because I I want for creators to be able to survive and and provide foran this is more just like this is more just information for other creators if you're just wondering how how the the to watch model works and maybe you want to do something similar and go on free C Camp and make think like how do how can I make free content but also make money yeah right because like we're not colluding here or or doing anything crazy here with free C Camp anybody can do it um yeah I mean we're very selective about whom we'll publish on free Cod camp but once you get past that yes if you are somebody who is good at what you do know a lot about what you do and want to create a course on some esoteric technology uh like cold fusion or uh or whatever right like four TR we've got a Fortran course or we we got a cobal course we don't have a four Tran course if anybody wants to create one if you're like some old guard you know uh Mainframe person and you you want to create a course on that as long as you're good at teaching yeah we're we're down you and I think the thing is just like finding a means to for we can make more videos right because it's just it's it's a silic but like right now it like looks like our prices are 29 USD I don't control the pricing that's all that's for like one certification like basic it's it's not a monthly recurring is there no we don't do subscriptions we don't believe in I mean maybe one day we'll have them but like I like people don't like them because they get charged when they don't want something yeah right so like maybe eventually we'll introduce a subscription but like we'd make sure that you can opt out of it and I there's other competitors in the space um that like I I was recommending but then when I sent up their platforms their content there was description then you still have to pay more and then like it was so hard to unsubscribe I really didn't like it like it was in Cloud space in particular and like I I L I literally yelled at them on Twitter because I wanted my money back because I was trying to recommend them because they had Labs like like lab systems I didn't have I don't care if people need education I want to recommend them to other places and so these are obviously ways to grow your organization and so you know we fundamentally thought okay we're just going to charge a single time fee it does expire after 3 years but we assume like the content will be expired by then anyway and also you should do it by then yeah it's like a little little uh carrot like you only have two years 11 month whatever it is a year two years again I don't know what I don't what the parameters are if it's a year or three years but it's the certifications are constantly getting refreshed like yeah and if people come to us we're pretty good about like oh I you know I want I I was just getting back into like fine here you go we'll just we're pretty like even people steal our content we're pretty uh lazy fair about it like cuz we like again everything's soft gated so it's like you know like don't don't if you're listening don't take you know Andrew's hard work and put it on bitor or something like that like you know 30 bucks depending on where you live do you have any sort of needbased scholarships or anything like that for uh people that are like in lower income countries have you ever experimented with like purchasing power priority we were we were trying to like it has to do with the payment Gateway right and so we were trying really hard to switch our payment Gateway and we spent like four or five months doing this and it just like the technology is just still really hard to get implemented so I don't know this is like this again this is why we're so relaxed about it but like you know I've seen people and they're like in West Africa they're you know like they're dealing with like constant power outages and they can't spend $10 outside outside their org right like or or their or their country not their their country is not an organization they're uh maybe one day but anyway anyway hopefully hopefully the countries remain nation states corporations that would be very uh that'd be very yeah but um but you know I would just say like I've seen people they take like screenshots of every single thing and made their own like downloadable slides and stuff like that but like I think that we're like we have a full free practice exam and all the contents there so like you wanted to go take screenshots of all the things so you have the slides so you can review them I don't care but it's it's another thing if you're uploading them to to torrent sites right that's that's another story like because you're optimizing for other people right so again I'm like there's people that go and they like they'll take videos and they're likey Andrew can I go record one of your practice exams on YouTube and review them I go sure I don't care do you know what I mean like I'm like I'm that relaxed about it because you know I I I know there's enough there that people are generally going to pay for it you know what I mean and the people that I I don't feel like like I've seen other people they've taken my content and they made free ebooks out of them yeah that is kind of like sketchy though when they're like literally selling stolen content I think that they weren't they weren't selling it they just were they're just they just were studying and they they uh they enriched it and put it in a format to the point where it's like I almost wanted to pay them so that we could put it on the marketplace which just never did yeah um and so I just went and they they were pretty transparent about they like yeah I did this and that and I went oh okay other companies would sue sue sue you out the nose but like for me I was just kind of like you know what I mean because if we're still making like I'm still if I can still afford things I don't care so much it's like people pirating video games like you know you heard about Nintendo uh and and the the tears of the Kingdom I've never played it but like the that one where they're going after um the uh the emulator for Nintendo like Nintendo switch because they're worried about it and so I'm very I'm very relaxed about it so until it actually impacts me I'm I'm pretty much yeah yeah you definitely don't like Nintendo has kind of like really damaged their reputation with Indie developers by being overly litigious and you don't want to do that you want to create like an ecosystem of people who are excited about exam Pro and recommend it and you don't want to have like a an iron fist as far as people um trying to use your tools right so but yeah camp like that's all built into our you know very permissive open source license you know people can take the free Camp PL it's by Design but when you're actually creating stuff that's not open source that you're trying to sell there's probably a lot more judgment involed I mean it's more like it's the issue is more like when we have schools that take it and they use and they do do this there's been schools the states and the UK not even like it's not like weird it's not like say I shouldn't say the word weird I just mean like countries where uh they're developing countries and they have a a inaccessibility to content I have no issues with them these are organizations that are all about making money they're in the US and the UK and they take my content they use in the curriculum um and they try to find ways around it so for instance they're taking the free Camp content and uh there's internal students there saying hey this is Andrew's content do you pay them or anything cuz they're paying like thousands of like like 7 to 7,000 to $10,000 to veterans veterans of the US at schools using the the the content that was published on free Co camp and so they they told me and I said hey you can't do this you like I said you should I said I would say like if you want to use this content pay a licensing fee and we'll even give you more to update up todate content so what they did instead is they took they took that down and they found one of my older unimi courses cuz I published them on un for free which never worked out by the way I just forgot about them and so they started using cont from like six seven years ago they're like well it's unies thing like and I was like are you kidding me and and these are accredited schools and so I went to their their accrediting board and said hey look this is not they're not they don't know what they're doing they're just taking content off the internet and then teaching and charging 10 thousands to veterans that are subed by the US government man veterans are so exploited I'm sure a lot of people listening to this have served in the US uh the US military uh and other militaries too but like once you have that GI bill money and or like like there are so many grifters out there trying to separate people from their hardearned money that the government gives them for their services uh I mean it's as Tail as old as time like the uh the M Mustang dealership uh right next to the uh the uh Army Recruitment Center and stuff like that right but but with with courses it's really like we want people to be spending that money on community colleges and universities and things like that not on you know kind of shoddy vocational training programs that are privately operated and I'm sure they are good programs too but it is definitely like it comes down to the indivual SCH it's frustrating when they're cutting Corners I mean first of all free Cod Camp use free Cod camps curricula like our actual curricula is totally chill to use right it's open source is accessible anywhere there are lots of organizations that run free code camp on a local network within like uh you know like prisons for example that don't have internet access shout out to persevere um and there are also a lot of uh you know computer labs in places that don't have good internet access which there are a lot of places like that in the US you know the the most developed wealthy country in the world right but have really bad internet coverage and a lot of people will take free Cod Camp they'll put it in like a computer lab at a school so people can actually like learn without having highp speed internet yeah it's a it's a different story when it's like people where like they don't have power half the time or they or they have a lack of access to Internet or it's a different story right but absolutely but but like we would be totally chill if people use free Cod camp in those circumstances but you know exampro Andrew Brown and other creators like please don't just wholesale take their material and and sell like free Cod Camp is designed where you can do that you can even white label free Cod camp and pretend it's your own coursework as long as you don't claim your free Cod Camp that's technically within the bounds of free Cod Camp's life for the interactive textual curricula which is all created by me and a whole bunch of other instructional designers and the open source Community but the stuff we publish on YouTube is like everything you publish on YouTube even though we're publishing it it's still technically copyright Andrew Brown and exam Pro right and and we want to always make sure that those copyrights are respected by everyone so sorry I'm it's hard to enforce copyright but it's just it's just about being respectful a lot of times creators like I'm a very flexible Creator and and my you know my attitude is like I'm just here to help people so when the inis boot camp one the uh the women cyber security had had adapted that and used it to teach a cloud for people that are getting cyber security I didn't ask for any money I just said oh great you're going to help more women get into cyber security you need a cloud basis here you go like I just need to understand the nature of they weren't trying to do this surreptitiously they no no I like sometimes people do things that they don't ask permission but it sometimes it's not an issue with me it's just like it really has to do it's like are you trying to charge some do you not have the expertise are you trying to charge someone $10,000 you know what I mean like for some and it has no outcome for them and do they even know that it's the content's coming for me are you are you misrepresenting the content so like my my goal is like I if I could and like if I wasn't a forprofit company like I I mean I wish I was a nonprofit company there just nonprofits are uh it's hard it's hard it's hard I know it's hard it's hard right and it's un like I'm just not in a place where it's like if I my house was paid off if I if I if I I didn't have debts a house and I was like a little bit a little bit better off I would be a nonprofit and my my whole curriculum would be even more transparently open course I'd make it an open book and I would be trying to push it onto places so that they there was a base level of that stuff so we need people who have these skills and and speaking of that like obviously we've been talking a lot about like the Creator economy and like the realities of creating content getting it out the distribution channel that is like YouTube uh the distribution channel that is like you know free Cod Camp if you want to look at it that way like I have an email newsletter that has 7 million recipients each week that is a way that I can help share the work of Andrew Brown and help more people prepare for and earn these certifications for example but like beyond that kind of like Creator related stuff and I'm sure there are a lot of creators listening in the audience for whom this is really excited about I want to get to the real um the real powerful unlock for everybody listening and that is talking about certifications and for people who want to earn certifications how they should focus their time so my first question for you if I'm a developer in 2024 maybe I've completed a few of the free C Camp certifications which are free that you can just earn by you know completing the projects and everything like that and I want to earn some professional certifications from big companies like Amazon or Microsoft where do I start what would you recommend for a basket of certifications that people should focus on if they just want to have the broadest opportunity possible before they really want to specialize before you get to certific if you should have a base knowledge of technical skills and so some uh what what free Camp delivers with their uh their free certifications the ones that you provide in different technologies will give you a basis of it if you don't have programming skills if you don't have networking skills if you don't have uh any like OS skills Linux skills you you will pass Cloud certifications but you won't be able to do anything when we did our itus boot camp we had people that held Pros Specialties all the highest level clusters notifications they couldn't use Discord they couldn't use a g like a GitHub account they could not write code they could not make diagrams they could not build anything they could not communicate properly and so what I'm saying to you is that CLA certifications require a another level of Base skills that you either have to do prior or during and so when I make my cloud courses I throw in a bunch of stuff in there that is not part of the certification okay and it will take longer to do and it'll be be annoying and it'll it'll take longer to get your goal but you have to have these skills and so you either want to obtain those skills first before you do it now let's talk about certifications certification like Cloud certifications I I think the the approach that is better is to go broad before you go deep okay so uh if you ask everybody else they'll always say go deep into like just pick a cloud and go deep into that yeah and and the reason I I say no is because every single cloud has their biased has their gaps and um they just won't have good coverage of the landscape of of stuff you need to learn and and you basically do need to learn it all not all at once but you need to learn it you need you need to learn it so um Microsoft has a very good approach where they have a bunch of fundamental certifications so they have their fundamentals which is just general Cloud then they have their data fundamentals their AI fundamentals their security fundamentals and there's probably another one and so that is a great approach because you're getting across uh across the board good coverage of your stuff and then when you have that then you can go deeper on another cloud and if you go into ads ads uh um their Cloud certification is it doesn't have enough coverage so you could do ad of us and then do all the other fundamentals that Microsoft has the only disadvantage of doing the Microsoft ones is that they're they're all focused specifically on their products so now you have to go to other clouds to to fill those gaps and I want to talk about like how those gaps are different if you are on the Microsoft platform um active directory which is a huge staple of the of the tech industry is extremely well covered on their platform okay you go to AWS it's like it doesn't exist you go to gcp it's like it doesn't exist and so that's like one big gap that you will have if you use if you're ons and you learn about servess Technologies they're first class over there they work excellent they're they're just so well interconnected you over to Azure Microsoft Azure and they are just not the same thing whatsoever like you don't use Azure functions to build apps with it you use it to execute like background jobs for integrated services on the platform it's it's like a totally different different thing because they're so underdeveloped you go over to gcp and gcp just real quick Google Cloud uh Pro what is it platform Google Cloud platform and AWS Amazon web services inter that's fair that's fair because they're they're different yeah the initialization there but like gcp you go over there they're really good with data like big queries like unbelievably great service uh their their ml services are unbelievably unbelievably excellent um and it's just it's just like it's just they're they're completely different so like people say they're the same and they are to a certain degree but then they're they're different and they'll give you a different aspect of of of the industry right right like uh and when you when you work at places it's it's yes most use a primary cloud provider but they're going to have a different way of working so um you know like Microsoft they're very CLI driven like everything is like when you're learning is like you're using scripts that are preexisting you're using lots of Powershell you're using lots of net you're using lots of dot Windows servers if you don't know that ecosystem you're going to have a hard time right and that's like a big gap as well not knowing that EOS like my cofounder he's really good at that stuff so I always I'm always pulling him in for that kind of stuff so I don't know it's just I would just say trying to get as much broad coverage as possible and that's like the opposite advice a lot of people say but it's weird because there's an older adage of a tshaped developer where you go Broad and then you go deep but people seem to have forgotten that or or they're they're just they're they're just in their bubble of their bias like they're in their like they're in their team and they just want to stick with their team I mean I I guess if I was just like somebody who didn't know a lot about what it was like actually working in Tech and I was just like I'm just going to pick AWS and I'm going to earn every AWS certification got to catch them all and like yeah you're like going through you're learning uh you're using exam Pro to like cover the fundamentals and I'm I'm uh relieved to hear that like you cover a lot of stuff that isn't on the exams just because it is stuff that people should know that goes beyond the scope of the exams but like I could easily see someone just using the official docs and just trying to grind through and earn these certifications and completely not seeing the forest for the trees that these certifications cover very specific you know tools that are all you know it's it's like building a castle in the sky right without that Foundation there to hold everything up you you might as well be like there there's that um the Chinese room Paradox right it's like a machine learning thing like if you're in the room and you have like some book and people are feeding in these Chinese characters and you're looking at the book and you're you're figuring out what Chinese character follows what character and you're ping that out you could technically be like an amazing you know Chinese character token predictor like uh without ever actually knowing Chinese because you're just following like some instructions but you don't actually understand what's going on by learning the fundamentals you ascend from being a mere you know automaton inside of you know a a Chinese character producing room uh to actually being somebody who knows what they're doing and understands the importance of tools and when to use certain tools in which context and all this stuff you're a wellrounded developer you're a tshaped developer right like you've got that breadth and then you've got that depth in the security space or the network space or whatever area you choose to specialize in right so so I know I'm just recapitulating what you said but uh 100% I think that uh it it is absolutely important to get the fundamentals okay well and there's other ones like that aren't Cloud specific like you should know I so like take the ter form CD as one you should know you should know how to work with uh Version Control Systems take the GitHub Foundation certification you should know how to do programming take the C certification right yeah free Camp has a a free C certification that we develops in partnership with Microsoft it uses official Microsoft documentation and we kind of like curated with them there there's ones there are no sort of like I don't think there's a SQL certification but it's like go take the the SQL course on free Camp when we did our boot camp all all of the prerequisites uh were free cam content it was all all all free Camp because we could fill all those gaps there the only the only challenge with like some of the stuff is that again it's not it's not it's not a problem it's just that people like things when they're packaged in a particular way so like a lot of these things it's like they're Great Courses there's like a compai course that came out uh like I think a recent like covered comsi but just like for some reason like if it's not packaged a certain way like there's not a goal post at the end you don't get a a paper at the end and and there's uh uh ways of checking it people kind of can discredit these things which which seems really silly to me um and so you know like it's not like I'm like crazy about certifications it's just the fact that it works as a mechanism to get people motivated um and so you know if there is a way to break out of that it'd be nice but I I don't think there is it's just the way humans are you got to play to to to how humans think yeah absolutely the teacher has to meet the learner halfway and empathize with the learner and and like all their circumstances if they want to help the learner mhm so just to recapitulate like like I mean you said if you want to learn your Version Control do this certification let's talk real quick about the GitHub certifications because GitHub just published some certifications very cool we've already got a few uh we've got at least one course by Andrew Brown on uh free Cod camp that covers one of these uh certifications the the foundational certification for GitHub right maybe we can talk maybe you could just give us some insight into how these certifications were developed how they were released and the interesting kind of sequence of events that transpired from there that you were personally involved in you know it depends on it depends on the certification every family certification uh I take a different approach to uh for GitHub I was really excited about it when I heard that they were releasing these certifications because uh my primary skills as a developer right some people from networking uh the it space technically I cover the it space but developer was it is my bread and butter and so GitHub I already knew inside and out like uh there was no question in my mind that I could produce a course uh very quickly and as soon as I saw the outline um I literally had every single course not just the GitHub foundations every single course broken up in terms of how in terms of how I would record it and the GitHub Foundation like included in like three four days in fact it would have been done sooner but there were uh some uh delays uh because uh we're talking about how how to release that course and the timing of it so so like it was just done instantly and it's because I could just literally open up GitHub and start recording without having to do any research whatsoever um it was it was the fastest course I ever I think I've ever produced like three or four days um but um uh the the challenge with that course in particular like people have to understand like there's it like when courses are engineered there are Legacy reasons as to why they're engineered so like that GitHub certification they existed they existed before this happened apparently they existed for like two three years they were used internally with Partners okay this this is common knowled I'm not giving Secrets out here this is not Secrets but so let's say you're like VMware or some other tech company and you're like we want to get our uh some of our Engineers certified on your your stuff like continuing professional education is that what they were used for yeah I think I think I think again GitHub has to be the one that really speaks to it but I believe that the purpose of it was that they had partners with GitHub and they were incentivized to get these certifications working in official capacity with GitHub and this is kind of like how adus does it and other ones but like adus has the Amazon partner Network or adus partner Network and if you want to advance in their Network you have to obtain particular certifications and they have internal ones and external ones and there's internal ones that people don't know about uh but Partners know know about that you have to get like working with AWS um and so GitHub had something similar not all organizations do that some are doing it for different reasons but that's how some of these things start out and so when these ones were engineered at GitHub they were built um to understand all of the products because they want their uh their Partners to know all their products um and the GitHub one doesn't actually cover a lot of git as it's focused mostly on the GitHub products but you're going to learn git either way whether you want to or not because you have to know to toze I me you have to know get in 2024 I'm sorry but like you're going to have to sit down and learn the weird syntax and the weird like yeah still still um and so and so you know um you know when that transitioned as a public thing I think that there was a legacy team and a new team uh uh has taken over and so I believe that um where they are right now is transitioning but when that stuff came out there was funny pricing around it uh like on Twitter uh we came out and I made the courses really quickly but when I went to go register the course I found it was like really expensive and they were all the same price uh and there was just some key things that were missing like there was no uh domain breakdown there was uh you didn't know what your score was but there was all reasons for it right and so I had taken guesses and I talked to GitHub and it turns out I was right on 99% of all the reasons why um but it was just that it was a legacy product that was transitioning to a new team uh and there and it was that they just did not have like they they a lot like the things that I say out loud or anyone say say out loud a lot times they're thinking about the same same thing so when I had voiced those things they heard them and they just needed they just needed external validation to change them and So within weeks they now have domain breakdowns I think they were talking about getting the score in uh there was considerations of bringing get into the the course and so um you know a lot of the reasons why courses are the way they are is because of Legacy reasons or there's product marketers and they want to get certain things in and often the people that actually want to do the curriculum development have to compromise and they don't get to exactly do what they want to do uh and again this is not just GitHub this is all of them adab us hashy Corp all of them right um and so uh you know certifications that's where I where I say they're not efficient or they're there's going to be like 30 or 40% credit that's more about like what product marketers want you to know or like or it's like PR wanted you to know to to to um now this is the GitHub certifications or would you say this is this typifies all certifications I'd say the ones that that do it the least is Hashi Corp certifications for some weird reason Hashi Corp like they have I would say the cleanest uh certifications I've ever seen where it's like every single item on the on on the exam guide is in the course so if there's a if there's a bullo you're going to get a question on it and there's no what are the values of hashy Corp and you know like you know what I'm saying like they're just like how do you use they're like it's terraform and you got to do a deploy what's the command terraform apply right very very uh practical as opposed to you know it's very and at first I wasn't sure about that but I I really like it cuz because like I I know I can go in there I can make the content uh like just go down the list I got good coverage people aren't stressed out about it you know what I mean it has application but these other ones it's just like it's just that there's more people getting involved in them they want to have different kinds of outcomes in them so some some people take over um you know it's it's just the nature of it so if that makes sense so what happened when like you approached them you you had all this this uh these I guess concerns for lack of a better word like this feedback well I just told them like I like I told them I said you know I I'm I'm really excited about the certification I want it to do well when it does well I make money and it lets me make more free courses for it helps everybody please make these changes and what I what I did was and it wasn't that I just like s it out loud like I like I went at them because it happened was that when I told people the price online on Twitter and Linkedin people went no and the price was $200 per certification every certific no no matter what level even the foundational one and so and so that didn't make sense so I took like 50 screenshots of people saying like I'm going to pass on this one the price doesn't make sense why is it like this and so I I was it was more like it was more like I'm bringing the internalized feelings of the community and rolling it up and bringing it to them that's usually what I do like when I'm today I was like giving a eight of us a hard time and I give them all a hard time which is not a great not a good move but yeah not great for your relationship with them but great for the end Learners who have to use these certifications I shouldn't say that like there's people like like even when I complain about a say there's people in my DMs that best and and and they they understand and they're working internally to do their best but the it's like these organizations are so large that there's there's good and there's people that are I don't want to say bad but they are uh they prioritize different things prioritize different things and so um you know like the whole point of being a Community member is to be the the check and balance of it but you have to you have to be strategic about it because sometimes complain out complaining out loud is not a good strategy and you need to internally work with them and so you have to have a system so if I have an internal process with somebody I'll always do that first and if if whatever reason that's not working then I will go external so like when I was complaining about ad us TNC today I know TNC leaders are reading it and I know to training certification okay right and so it it's me trying to exert pressure to make changes that's better for everybody and AWS like and the other partner included right but there's a point where sometimes the decision is their decision and you're now you're just being a jerk right and so you have to you have to walk that line and go okay I'm not being somebody that's just uh uh trying to get my way versus something like it's more of a like that's what they want to do so like with GitHub and you know spoiler alert you were able to essentially get them to cut the price of these certifications in half I would say I would say that they want they needed to hear it from the community and I just did the leg work for them I didn't I didn't cut the prices but I mean putting yourself on the line and and carrying that and risking them shooting the messenger and being like screw this Andrew Brown guy he's a rabble Rouser right well I mean it was it was low risk at this point because like I didn't have like an established relationship with GitHub internally but I'm just saying that it can be like if you're if I mean jeopardized potential future relationship you right yeah but you know sometimes like some like it just depends on the attitude some people some people are cool with it right or there are there's like it's like if I had a bad relationship with Hashi now one of my friends works there and and they did the they did the like work and said no Andrew Brown is is here to help and he's going to help you you just got to you got to just work this way and then we'll get this great outcome right like whatever organization and so um it's kind of like that it's it's hard because you got to understand like I'm not here to promote these these companies I'm here to promote the community and so I'm trying to work with these organizations but at the same time it's like at the end of the day these companies are money driven right so yeah I they have to not the people but like the organization as a whole they have to grow they have investors right they're on that bus that can't go below 50 miles an hour so um maybe you could talk a little bit about uh the the improvements that they were able to make thanks to the feedback I gave to the they almost took almost all the feedback that and and the things that they couldn't do it's like it was more like we have to work on this over time so again like they got the domains in so in the video you'll see in the video I go they didn't do domains I think they should do domains they have those in now they're in there right um I think they might show the the exam the the uh the exam the exam score there was like key missing content about the exam that you needed to know to take it they filled that out so like that was where that's an example of um a certification team that is extremely receptive uh and and trying to do the best outcome for their certifications right awesome yeah it's hard it's heartening to hear this and I just want to emphasize that like ultimately your interests and their interests are aligned even though they're trying to make money you're trying to you know ultimately make money in a way but the way you make money is by helping people prepare for these certifications and ultimately get these certifications and have Downstream like success as a result of having earn these certifications and actually understanding the skills and having like I guess is like preparing for a certification is not like it's not like sitting around and playing Tetris to attack all day and having fun right it's a lot of hard work yeah and and money so so like kind of smoothing out their learning curve and and just making things as clear as possible so really you're an advocate for the learner is how I look at you well yeah I mean I I think I I would be a developer Advocate like if I wasn't doing this I I'd be I'd probably do an okay developer Advocate or one of these organizations but um uh you know coming back to that point on um uh you know like advocating for stuff it's like if I if like when I I was so excited about GitHub I I made so much hype on that like so many people even even if the cost was $200 they all like actually when that cost dropped and we we promoted it so many people signed up and we're like I'm taking this certification now and so I feel an obligation to make sure that I I deliver the content that is quality content that's reasonable to pass that that that we're setting like good expectations of the outcome because if I tell I'm going to go get a certification and they go get it and now they're out of money and now they can't pay their bills I feel really bad about it yeah um and that's that's that's a big concern and like even like the courses that coming out for the Inus refresh that I'm doing the big ones that everyone's been waiting for forever um like I'm going to be having like a large disclaimer in the beginning explaining like hey there's going to be gaps in knowledge you need to fill these out go look at other free Cod Camp courses that will have them and I will package as much as I can in here but I can't I can't put the whole sun in here you know what I mean I can't well thing that like the theme running through you know your communication with these certification providers and the the work that you do to try to prepare Learners uh and set expectations reasonably you're not like some hype man that's out like this certification is going to change your life you're like this is one of many things that you're going to need to do if you want to have a successful career over the next 20 30 40 years right like you're you're very um just down to earth and like you don't want to hype things up like you don't want to overpromise and underd deliver well I just don't I don't want people to end up in a spot like it's like we had a we had somebody that was like in Canada that was like Hey I want to become a solution architect and I'm paying $7,000 to take a a certification boot camp and I'm going to I'm going to get these five certifications right and they just passed their Cloud partitioner they paid like a thousand like so that means like a, ,500 just to do Cloud partitioner makes no sense to me which we have it for free and it's even more more more robust than any course out there on free C camp and and they're going I'm going to become a solution architect in 9 months and I said you're going to get the most senior senior role possible in the in the cloud industry in nine months that's only given to people that have already worked for years and you think you're going to get that and that's that's the promise that that's the overselling that people have and I'm tell I say and I say to them I'm like you should plan for three years you should have all these adjacent skills and you should assume you should have a backup plan because if if you're burning through all your money you're going to be in a bad spot it's not that it's impossible for it to happen it's just that you need to you need to hedge your bets and and put put yourself in the best position yeah and it's not like if we're in 2016 and 2018 like 2016 is probably better say 2016 you got to start that was a different story because at the time everybody was very curious about cloud and they didn't know much about it and you could just say that you had a certification or were going to go sit one and I was like this I was in Toronto and like there was like big fintech fintech banks that said oh yeah you yeah you have your associate and you're going for your pro can you come in and interview and like and then like you'd be doing whiteboarding and they'd be like okay because they just had no domain knowledge whatsoever and it wasn't that it was hard it was just like they had no confidence in it that time is over and it's with everything like now you know what the new thing is is like how are you going to utilize a ml like like large language models or ML and stuff like that and so that's the new thing that people are going and at one point it was like data it was like oh data everything's data driven now everything's like a the new oil and so and so um you know I think that uh like it's just the the cloud industry is matured like anything else and it's not like it's becoming devalued like people like people still need people to build websites that hasn't changed I mean it's just layers right like there's still web development and there's people are still running CL engineering and then there's ML on you know mood Juma those things are still running okay people need throwback people are still using them there's a whole Community around them like yeah I mean like I said earlier for train I joked like oh get some there are main frames running at like you know state governments you know Employment Office things like that that that so use these old tools because you get the system running you don't want to just scrap it and build a new one right there was a kid that got like a like an old supercomputer it was like wasn't old it was like old by like seven years standard and he set it up in his his house his parents helped him buy it and it's like an old IBM one and he learned Fortran on or something and then and he wanted to see the the ones that they had at IBM so IBM invited him over and he got to see them and they ended up hiring him wow that's cool you you know what I mean like it doesn't matter like there was there's like but you there is a smaller pool right like there's one person that still does um um was it cold fusion right there's a there's a woman out there that does c fusion and there's still work for it but the thing is is that you know you have to want to do that um and and be passionate about it and and I think there's opportunities there and I just wish that people would just keep running with it and that's the problem they just they want to really make money and I I get it I understand why yeah but but like in the race to make money like I mean generally like you need a lot fewer skills to do jumla development or WordPress development than you do to be like a machine learning engineer uh I mean a lot of those people have phds and a lot of those people have you know a decade or more experience working as a python developer you know uh doing like just backend development or something like that right A lot of people have domain expertise uh you can absolutely do that you could become a machine learning engineer by the time you are in your mid20s if you if you do everything right and stuff like that I know machine learning Engineers who are in their mid 20s but it's a lot harder to do that um and I think a lot of lot of people are seeing the machine learning engineers in their 20s and thinking oh I can do that too if I pay this person $10,000 to do their machine learning Boot Camp or whatever right that like there there will be people out there who will happily accept your money to overpromise you know what you're the mileage you're going to get I don't have a problem for people charging $10,000 if it has an outcome if it has the guarant like if you know what you're paying for right but it's like like when you go to a school like accredited school at least in Canada there is like you have your student union you have particular rights have to be enforced curriculums have to be developed a certain way uh they're supposed to have like uh like like on campus stuff and other resources now whether the education is failing in terms of the Quality quality of the materials is a different story but you're paying for that infrastructure around it for a guarantee um though Canada has been having a bit of issues because they've been um getting in trouble for not having uh the proper outcomes as of recent so well I mean the US same thing like there same thing yeah th000 universities or colleges in the United States but I mean come on like how many of those are actually like a college that you would be like really proud to have graduated from well in Canada the the the best school is waterl comp side water you go or University of Toronto is very good but like you go to wlu you'll you'll like you will get a job no matter what you'll get a job because they've they've done such a good job making sure that students have an outcome the cup students get paid right they like you get a 90 if you get 99% you can still fail you get what I mean like they have a they set a really high bar um and uh employers know what they're getting right and so they have that Loop but most schools don't do that they're just like you pay and then you got to go get the job yourself and uh you know what I mean like they they might have some kind of network but it's not as as robust as it is but I'm just saying like if you pay $10,000 or whatever it is to go to Wu it's worth the money right if you get in the right time and you have the money but it's it's these other issues where it's like $10,000 and it was it was all Vapor to begin with um but you know again it's I just want people to make sure that they're getting what they want out out of their money or no if they have no money you know whatever it is right so absolutely yeah and and that's like the name of the game is like under promising overd delivering optimizing for having a reputation which is something you've been investing in for so long uh through everything you've been doing with exam Pro and everything you've personally been doing to advocate for Learners just building up that reputation for or I'm not going to screw you you can trust me that like I'm going to say the reality and not overhype things right um and that's what I want to talk about because there there's I I really need more bread though yeah like literally literally well by optimizing for the long term right like that is the name of the game right optimizing for the next few decades people are still probably going to be taking professional certifications decades from now people are definitely going to still be working as developers regardless of what Jensen Quang CE it's there AI bot that has to go through my certifications that's fine yeah yeah uh it'll just be a few API calls and the certification will be earned no uh I don't believe that that's going to come to pass anytime soon so uh but uh just a quick correction there are 3,931 title for degree granting institutions in the United States so it's not 5,000 it's contracted a little bit which is probably for the better frankly I don't think we 5,000 institutions in the United States but um what I wanted to say is um you and I both grew up watching a TV show that's essentially advocates for that value of like optimizing for the longterm following Prime directives and not you know corrupting civilizations with technology too soon Golden Girls Golden Girls right yeah oh yeah Golden Girls that was the show we watched no we we you may have watched that I have never seen an of Golden Girls I'm sorry to say for all the Golden Girls maybe I'll check it I've heard good things but Star Trek so we we've talked about so much we've talked for more than two hours but I do want to the obligatory let's talk about Star Trek because um you and and Andrew your cofounder he's got this giant poster it's like a blueprint of uh oh yeah he he's yeah like of the Starship Enterprise uh I wanted to talk just a little bit because I I do imagine there are a lot of tiies in the audience people who love Star Trek and I love Star Trek because it's got a humanist message I love it because it has intelligent plots and intelligent interactions people are polite they're civil they get things done they're practical but at the same time they have values and uh you know when I was a kid my role model was Captain mcard because he always seemed to like have this highminded like approach to like solving problems and often he'd be presented with an easy way and he'd be like wait there might be a better way that's not as easy let's see if we can find that he didn't stop merely at the easy way um maybe you can talk a little bit about your relationship with Star Trek over the years I mean Star Trek does set really good uh moral values uh and I I think that's the aspect there is that you have this um uh uh Community or or uh I don't sure the word is I'm trying to look for but the idea is that you have all these people where they're not worried about money they're they're they're trying scarcity post they're have a post scar scarcity mindset and so that they can uh do good do good however they they see fit um and I and I think the thing is like holding up uh your sense of um more like I keep saying morals but the idea like ethics right like so you know like Captain Bard or all these other people have um uh moral ethics about you know what it is that they want to do and and and the betterment of the world and they're not thinking thinking about the uh the materialistic things to to show the EMB betterment of folks and I to me like that is just you know if you can live up to that that that is amazing right and you know I I want to I want to get to that point at some point and so the idea of like producing free content around the world and and having everyone upskill is is that lift up uh you know at least that's what I think so I don't know I think there's a lot of ties there if that makes sense so you see some some of your role as Andrew Brown founder of exam pro. Co like facilitating that kind of path toward a post scarcity Utopia really and it's not a Utopia in the sense that you know everything's solved and people just hang out all day people actually work really hard in Star Trek and they still have regimented work schedules and everybody still follows a strict dress code and all stuff yeah they want to work right they want to work they want to get things done they want to push forward the frontier of human understanding by exploration it's not it's not about going to work so you can make as much money as you can to buy things when you go home uh or go on trips right like it's like you want to actually do things that matter yeah I think a lot of people do want to do things that matter but like when they get into the workforce and it's a different story then and and then also just the nature of businesses um you know that's I think that's the the hard part you know so yeah I mean you and I talked about game development earlier like game development is a terrible field to go into don't go into game development unless you're going to be like an indie like I hear horror stories about people that worked at blizzard and companies like that right um and yet like think of how many creative passionate people who love developing games who are instead you know working as like database administrators or um you know software Engineers that like SAS tech companies because that's where the money is and and they would love they're even hoping to like put away a lot of money so they can eventually go and develop games right just imagine if everybody who wanted to be a game developer could be a game developer and money wasn't like an objective or it wasn't a consideration right well I mean I think a lot of them it wasn't like you look at uh I'm trying remember his name but it's the creator of Fallout the original series he has a YouTube channel he's that would be really good interview I'd love to hear intervie he's on he's on YouTube um I just can't remember his name for some reason but um uh like he talks about like how like it reminds me of when I got into Tech which is like the idea like the reason of course I was a bit strategic that I didn't go to game development because I need I know I had to make some money but the idea of working with like a passionate team and everyone's excited about working on this thing and and moving towards a common goal is like super exciting that was like my huge draw for startups because like you fix computers it's like computer in computer out you know what I mean I don't want to do that forever um but like the idea of building some kind of big product that is bigger than that uh than all of us together and it's going to be an EMB betterment for everybody there's like a funny scene in in um Silicon Valley where they're they're at uh uh the startup like like the tech crunch or something and they're all pitching their products Tech startup disrupt I actually pitched there I went to their big hackathon and I was the first out of 350 people that were presenting I had to be on the stage first but every product is like they're like we're trying to be loo Cal and mobile like they trying to help trying to help people it's going to better world and like that was kind of like the like the reason I really got into startups like uh but it's just the fact that um there's that component but anyway he was talking about the video game industry and like he's like you can get paid to make video games and they like they're obviously being exploited and they didn't mind because they all they wanted to do was all day every day work on video games like a workaholic and that's like how kind of like how I am where it's like you can make you can make money doing this you can make money teaching people how to code and it wasn't like I was trying to make millions I just to like the idea is like youd make something and then you know you can kind of do whatever you want or or like I met like a lot of early startups where they they had their their dot startup that did really well and so now they're kind of reliving their dreams as Angel Investors and they're like we we would go and hang out with them and and they were like really good mentors but unfortunately again it's just the nature of where things where things go um which is like can we have that without the whole uh greed component in there I don't know how that works yeah I mean like I think it's just necessary like everybody wants to make a return I I used to think like oh man there's like something fundamentally flawed like capitalism is just racing us toward this this outcome and and that may be the case but in general if you have money and you want to make a return on it you need to invest money in things that are going to grow and if a company is not growing then why would you put your money there because you have to make just inflation right inflation is normally about 2 to 3% in the United States so you have to make at least 2 to 3% or else you're losing money every year and like what if you're a big pension fund like cpers the big California pension fund you have to find enough places that you can put money to get growth so that you can continue to compound apparently uh inflammation uh inflammation infl infl uh inflation that's my trick for losing weight but I get inflammation for for months I'm not joking I get inflammation for months and I lose a bunch of weight it's the best uh uh best way to lose weight but anyway uh inflation like I was watching a video about like Japan and how they had INF uh deflation well they just had no inflation for for uh for many years and they're talking about like you want to have gradual inflation because uh it stimulates spend or something like it was important they're like it's good you have to have a little bit yeah you do want some inflation the main reason you want inflation is because deflation is incredibly catastrophic if you ever get into a a state of deflation nobody's spending any money cuz like why would you spend money you just hoard your money because your money's going to be worth more tomorrow than it is today so why would you spend it today and as a as a result everybody hoardes their money and the economy just grinds to a halt so you don't want deflation but you want some amount of inflation just to ensure that there's a buffer between you know not not going into deflationary territory because it's so catastrophic but sorry you yeah Japan is a very interesting economy to study if anybody out there likes studying about economics and stuff like the the policy interesting like experiment they do is like they've had so many weird economic experiments it's so interesting yeah but sorry you were talking about um how do we get on that we were talking about um so if we if we go back to Star Trek which is what I really want to talk about sure why not yeah like like how would you be different if you had if Star Trek had never existed do you think it opened some perspectives uh do you think it's spurred your imagination I I think maybe like maybe I'd be more opportunistic and I I would be less focused on like Community involvement like I think the reason I'm so involved in community involvement is because it was mandatory because my uh my grandfather who was uh like he was like my mom just won an award in the province for volunteering and my my grandfather uh did a lot of volunteering in Thunder Bay like like he ran uh the hockey for the kids in the entire town the the soccer he ran like uh the bingo halls did all his volunteer work for kids uh uh and um I guess it was just because like he was a like a veteran from World War II and he had like terrible upbringing right his dad died when he was young because uh um his dad was a uh mortician or whatever that you the person that handles the dead people yeah so his dad died when he was young so he was like really poor and then uh you like he went to war and they thought he died and they spent all his money so came back he had to work harder like at the Mill or whatever and so you know this the greatest Generation having such a hard time I feel like they did a lot more for their their Community because of uh the hard times that they had and so that part like I spent so much time with my grandparents that uh it just became something that you're supposed to do like you don't even think about like why are you doing this there's no money and it's like what do you mean you're you do this because it's good for everybody right like it wasn't it was never a thought of like like why wouldn't you do this and it's like then you have Star Trek which is also enforcing that thing of like why are why are you working for money yeah like why are you doing that that makes no sense that doesn't better anybody so yeah they even have the fangi who are this alien species that is focused on wealth and like accumulation of wealth and it's supposed to model like the 20th century humans in the 21th century that's not to say like I don't think about money at all like I have to because there's a bare minimum which is very frustrating I I hate it but you know at some but I go I need to make money so I can do the things that I want to do which is to do you know better things um you know and again like if if for long term right so yeah unfortunately it's still a thing that you have to do but like it's it's like getting to a point where I don't have to do it which is which is really I sure everybody I know so many teachers uh teachers social workers other people who are frankly like greatly undervalued by Society in terms of their compensation but they love the work they they know the work needs to be done they want to do it even at personal sacrifice um yeah well I want to close with this question about Star Trek cuz I love Star Trek so much and uh have you watched all of Star Trek like have you watched like every single series yep You' even watched like the new ones like theard yep yeah okay who is your favorite Captain who who do you think best exemplifies the values of like you know Starfleet and uh I mean Bard probably but I mean like my favorite Captain is Cisco I really like Captain Cisco from Deep Space 9 yeah what just what do you like about him I I think he's more of a pragmatist so like like he like Deep Space 9 takes place on a um uh the frontier uh a Frontier where it's on like on the out like the outskirts of the Federation and so their values are being tested all the time right um and I think that that's really interesting to say okay you have this utopian but what how do you deal with it when you're you're dealing with people that don't have all the benefit things that you have and how are you going to meet in the middle and uh and how are you going to like where are you going to compromise in terms of your moral values and and I think that that Captain uh handles it in a very a very interesting way and we get uh very interesting uh story lines uh yeah like kind of real politic because Prosperity is not evenly distributed and we talk about the post scarcity but that's really human civilizations Vulcans and a few other uh a few other races have like that level of prosperity but you you do have people that are suffering quite a bit and uh you know starf can't help everybody right the Federation can't help everybody they have to make these kind of tactical decisions and also the d space 9 there is like a diplomatic kind of show like you've got the Waring factions that are kind of constantly encroaching on one another's space and getting into territorial disputes and things like that too so but yeah I mean again like I'd say yeah Cisco is my favorite Captain but if if we're talking about the ideals Ard Picard always is uh is the one there that I think that uh upholds it the best yeah and some people may even see Picard's boring because he's he's to two dimensional because he just has these uh very specific like you can almost always predict what bicard is going to do given a certain situation if you've watched some s trick because he he is a very uh I mean he does grow and progress as as a human uh and he's constantly reading constantly learning he lover of history but at the same time you know that like at the end of the day he's going to take the most highminded approach and he's not going to compromise his ideals and yeah that that can make it less exciting than watching somebody who's much more Dynamic than Cisco yeah and then if somebody just wanted to watch like one Star Trek show to like like they've never watched Star Trek before you want to get somebody like eased into the Star Trek universe what would you recommend they start with I mean I have a very particular favorite episode of Star Trek my favorite episode is duet from Deep Space 9 season 1 season one is not a very good season but that's an excellent episode um and uh this very I was actually like no one ever talked about this episode for years but then a few years ago I think uh it gained some popularity because someone in um I think his St Trek Discovery was like Hey I really like this episode I think this was was fantastic but this specific episode is about um Kieran narice and their uh for those who don't know like beour beour yeah we're going here beour is a is a um a a world that was uh occupied by the Kardashians for years and the Kardashians uh uh basically enslaved them and had them strip mine their own Planet taking all of their resources and then uh the Kardashians uh were in a war with the Federation and wasted a lot of resources and then they decided that the uh the war was over they were having a peace with the Federation and they decided that they're going to uh leave beor and put it back in the beor people because they've taken all that they've wanted um and so uh beour has a lot of animosity towards um the cardasians for their treatment and so in this episode uh Kieran arice sees that there is a ship coming through to the station and it has a very specific Kardashian that was known for running labor camps on beour and so they wanted they want to bring him in for war crimes even though but the card say there was no war because they were just occupied right historical revisionism essentially yeah and so and so this fellow here well I'll end up like I'll end up ruing it I tell you but the point is is that it's it's about it's about this and it changes her mindset and it's the fact that it's about the what like about this episode it challenges uh like your your preconceptions about people um and that's what I like it's like when you have those those kind of moments yeah so that's that's my favorite episode but there's a lot of good episodes out there um but a lot of people like uh what's the one it's like uh the light or um it's it's the one Inner Light yeah people the in light's very good um there's that one uh there's another really good DS9 one which like it's uhing the moonlight moonlight something I I don't know why I can't recall right now or something like that anyway but yeah I if there was one that I'd start with is duet I think it's the best one that's that for me anyway for me in the pale Moonlight in the oh that's really good so so I haven't gotten that far in d space 9 uh I I'm on like season four season five I've just been gradually working through it through adulthood so I haven't gotten there cuz I'm I'm like I've heard it's so hyped up I don't know what'll happen have you have you heard have you heard the greatest Generation podcast huh the great there's these two fellows in in the the US and they it's called the greatest generation and they watch every single episode of Star Trek and they do a podcast on it but they oh wait I have watch I hav heard but I heard it like way back when it first started and I'm like yeah I think they finished everything and now they're doing uh they said they'd never do Babylon 5 and now they're doing Babylon 5 which we know be and I love Babylon 5 that's another good series but yeah very heavy diplomacy Focus five different alien races that have to like essentially coincide and stuff yeah man I could talk all day about this uh so shout out to duet which is in season one of Deep Space 9 you don't have to be very deep into Deep Space 9 what the first eight episodes and Bam one of the greatest episodes of Star Trek ever right there I I finally remember that episode uh so yeah I I guess parting wisdom for the community be sure to check out some of Andrew's awesome courses and note that if you hear AI voice it's not just because he lazy but to protect his actual voice yeah if you can tell but you know like again most if it's like my core courses it's going to be me yeah but uh yeah there's just some they'll never get made unless we use that AI voice so yeah well hey Andrew I know that you and I talk all the time we're constantly corresponding about upcoming courses that you're developing but I just want to thank you right here on the podcast I want to thank you again for everything you're doing not just for the developer community Through developing these amazing courses which you're publishing for free on the fre Cod Camp Community YouTube channel but also for the advocacy work you're doing for people who are earning these certifications like taking your insights and sharing them with AWS sharing them with GitHub trying to get these certifications to be improved right risking your own reputation that some manager is going to shoot the messenger because you really do want these certifications to be good you want them to be representative of what people want to learn and obviously there are so many things you could do to probably improve your own personal situation uh financially you've got all these
