00:18 - This video is about working with rational
expressions. A rational expression is a fraction,
00:23 - usually with variables in it, something like
x plus two over x squared minus three is a
00:29 - rational expression. In this video, we'll
practice adding, subtracting, multiplying
00:34 - and dividing rational expressions, and simplifying
them to lowest terms. We'll start with simplifying
00:45 - to lowest terms. Recall, if you have a fraction
with just numbers in it something like 21
00:50 - over 45, we can reduce it to lowest terms
by factoring the numerator and factoring the
00:58 - denominator and then canceling common factors.
So in this example, the three is cancel, and
01:10 - our fraction reduces to seven over 15. If
we want to reduce rational expression with
01:18 - variables and add to lowest terms, we proceed
the same way. First, we'll factor the numerator,
01:24 - that's three times x plus two, and then factor
the denominator. In this case of factors 2x
01:31 - plus two times x plus two, we could also write
that as x plus two squared. Now we cancel
01:38 - the common factors. And we're left with three
over x plus two. Definitely a simpler way
01:46 - of writing that rational expression. Now next,
let's practice multiplying and dividing. Recall
01:52 - that if we multiply two fractions with just
numbers in them, we simply multiply the numerators
01:59 - and multiply the denominators. So in this
case, we would get four times two over three
02:04 - times five or 8/15. If we want to divide two
fractions, like in the second example, then
02:13 - we can rewrite it as multiplying by the reciprocal
of the fraction on the denominator. So here,
02:22 - we get four fifths times three halves, and
that gives us 12 tenths. But actually, we
02:30 - could reduce that fraction to six fifths,
we use the same rules when we compute the
02:37 - product or quotient of two rational expressions
with variables on them. Here, we're trying
02:42 - to divide to rational expressions. So instead,
we can multiply by the reciprocal, I call
02:50 - this flipping and multiplying. And now we
just multiply the numerators. And multiply
03:00 - the denominators. It might be tempting at
this point to multiply out to distribute out
03:08 - the numerator and the denominator. But actually,
it's better to leave it in this factored form
03:12 - and factored even more completely. That way,
we'll be able to reduce the rational expression
03:17 - to cancel the common factors. So let's factor
even more the x squared plus x factors as
03:25 - x times x plus one, and x squared minus 16.
And that's a difference of two squares, that's
03:32 - x plus four times x minus four, the denominator
is already fully factored, so we'll just copy
03:39 - it over. And now we can cancel common factors
here and here, and we're left with x times
03:47 - x minus four. This is our final answer. Adding
and subtracting fractions is a little more
03:55 - complicated because we first have to find
a common denominator. A common denominator
04:00 - is an expression that both denominators divided
into, it's usually best of the long run to
04:06 - use the least common denominator, which is
the smallest expression that both denominators
04:12 - divided into.
04:14 - In this example, if we just want a common
denominator, we could use six times 15, which
04:19 - is 90 because both six and 15 divided evenly
into 90. But if we want the least common denominator,
04:26 - the best way to do that is to factor the two
denominators. So six is two times 315 is three
04:35 - times five, and then put together only the
factors we need for both six and 15 to divide
04:42 - our numbers, so if we just use two times three
times five, which is 30. We know that two
04:51 - times three will divide it and three times
five will also divide it and we won't be able
04:56 - to get a denominator any smaller because we
need the factor of two three and five, in
05:01 - order to ensure both these numbers divided,
once we have our least common denominator,
05:06 - we can rewrite each of our fractions in terms
of that denominator. So seven, six, I need
05:13 - to get a 30 in the denominator, so I'm going
to multiply that by five over five, and multiply
05:20 - by the factors that are missing from the current
denominator in order to get my least common
05:26 - denominator of 30. For the second fraction,
for 1515 times two is 30. So I'm going to
05:35 - multiply by two over two, I can rewrite this
as 3530 s minus 830 s. And now that I have
05:47 - a common denominator, I can just subtract
my two numerators. And I get 27/30. If I factor,
05:57 - I can reduce this to three squared over two
times five, which is nine tenths. The process
06:07 - for finding the sum of two rational expressions
with variables in them follows the exact same
06:12 - process. First, we have to find the least
common denominator, I'll do that by factoring
06:18 - the two denominators. So 2x plus two factors
as two times x plus 1x squared minus one,
06:25 - that's a difference of two squares. So that's
x plus one times x minus one. Now for the
06:30 - least common denominator, I'm going to take
all the factors, I need to get an expression
06:36 - that each of these divides into, so I need
the factor two, I need the factor x plus one,
06:41 - and I need the factor x minus one, I don't
have to repeat the factor x plus one I just
06:46 - need to have at one time. And so I will get
my least common denominator two times x plus
06:52 - one times x minus one, I'm not going to bother
multiplying this out, it's actually better
06:57 - to leave it in factored form to help me simplify
later. Now I can rewrite each of my two rational
07:04 - expressions by multiplying by whatever's missing
from the denominator in terms of the least
07:10 - common denominator. So what I mean is, I can
rewrite three over 2x plus two, I'll write
07:15 - the 2x plus two is two times x plus one, I'll
write it in factored form. And then I noticed
07:21 - that compared to the least common denominator,
I'm missing the factor of x minus one. So
07:26 - I multiply the numerator and the denominator
by x minus one I just needed in the denominator,
07:32 - but I can't get away with just multiplying
by the denominator without changing my expression,
07:37 - I have to multiply by it on the numerator
and the denominator. So I'm just multiplying
07:41 - by one and a fancy form and not changing the
value here. So now I do the same thing for
07:47 - the second rational expression. I'll write
the denominator in factored form to make it
07:51 - easier to see what's missing from the denominator.
What's missing in this denominator, compared
07:57 - to my least common denominator is just the
factor two. So I multiply the numerator and
08:02 - the denominator by two. Now I can rewrite
everything. So the first rational expression
08:08 - becomes three times x minus one over two times
x plus 1x minus one, and the second one becomes
08:16 - five times two over two times x plus 1x minus
one, notice that I now have a common denominator.
08:25 - So I can just add together my numerators.
So I get three times x minus one plus 10 over
08:31 - two times x plus 1x minus one. I'd like to
simplify this. And the best way to do that
08:38 - is to leave the denominator in factored form.
But I do have to multiply out the numerator
08:44 - so that I can add things together. So I get
3x minus three plus 10 over two times x plus
08:53 - 1x minus one, or 3x plus seven over two times
x plus 1x minus one. Now 3x plus seven doesn't
09:02 - factor. And there's therefore no factors that
I can cancel out. So this is already reduced.
09:09 - As much as it can be. This is my final answer.
09:13 - In this video, we saw how to simplify rational
expressions to lowest terms by factoring and
09:21 - canceling common factors. We also saw how
to multiply rational expressions by multiplying
09:27 - the numerator and multiplying the denominator
had divide rational expressions by flipping
09:32 - and multiplying, and how to add and subtract
rational expressions by writing them in terms
09:37 - of the least common denominator. This video
is about the difference quotient and the average
09:44 - rate of change. These are topics that are
related to the concept of derivative and calculus.
09:51 - For function y equals f of x, like the function
whose graph right here, a secant line is a
09:59 - lie. that stretches between two points on
the graph of the function. I'm going to label
10:07 - this x value has a, and this x value as B.
So this point here on the graph is going to
10:15 - have an x value of a, and a y value given
by f of a, the second point will have x value
10:23 - B and Y value, f of b. Now the average rate
of change for a function on the interval from
10:32 - a to b can be defined as the slope have the
secret line between the two points A, F of
10:47 - A and B, F of B. In symbols, that slope m
is the rise over the run, or the change in
10:57 - y over the change in x, which is the difference
in Y coordinates f of b minus F of A over
11:06 - the difference in x coordinates b minus a.
So this is the average rate of change. To
11:14 - put this in context, if for example, f of
x represents the height of a tree, and x represents
11:22 - time in years, then f of b minus f of a represents
a difference in height, or the amount the
11:30 - tree grows. And B minus A represents a difference
in in years, so a time period. So this average
11:38 - rate of change is the amount the tree grows
in a certain time period. For example, if
11:43 - it grows 10 inches in two years, that would
be 10 inches per two years, or five inches
11:49 - per year would be its average rate of change
its average rate of growth, let's compute
11:55 - the average rate of change for the function
f of x equals square root of x on the interval
11:59 - from one to four.
12:01 - So
12:02 - the average rate of change is f of four minus
f of one over four minus one, well, f of four
12:11 - is the square root of four of one's the square
root of one. So that's going to be two minus
12:19 - one over three or 1/3. Instead of calling
these two locations on the x axis, a and b,
12:28 - this time, I'm going to call the first location,
just x and the second location, x plus h.
12:37 - The idea is that h represents the horizontal
distance between these two locations on the
12:44 - x axis. In this notation, if I want to label
this point on the graph of y equals f of x,
12:52 - it'll have an x coordinate of x and a y coordinate
of f of x. The second point will have an x
13:00 - coordinate of x plus h and a y coordinate
of f of x plus h. a difference quotient is
13:08 - simply the average rate of change using this
x x plus h notation. So a different version
13:16 - represents the average rate of change of a
function, f of x on the interval from x to
13:26 - x plus h. Equivalent way, the difference quotient
represents the slope of the secant line for
13:37 - the graph of y equals f of x between the points
with coordinates x, f of x, and x plus h,
13:48 - f of x plus h. Let's work out a formula for
the difference quotient. Remember that the
13:55 - formula for the average rate of change could
be written as f of b minus F of A over B minus
14:01 - A, where a and b are the two locations on
the x axis. But now I'm calling instead of
14:10 - a I'm using x instead of B, I'm using x plus
h. So I can rewrite this average rate of change
14:15 - as f of x plus h minus f of x over x plus
h minus x. That simplifies a little bit on
14:26 - the denominator. Because x plus h minus x,
I can cancel the access and I get the difference
14:35 - quotient formula f of x plus h minus f of
x over h. The quantity h on denominator It
14:44 - looks like a single entity, but it still represents
a difference in x values. Let's find and simplify
14:52 - the difference quotient for this function
given first or write down the general formula
14:58 - for the difference quotient. That's an F of
x plus h minus f of x over h. I'm going to
15:06 - compute f of x plus h first, I do this by
shoving in x plus h, everywhere I see an x
15:14 - in the formula for the function. So that's
going to give me two times x plus h squared
15:22 - minus x plus h plus three. Notice how I use
parentheses here. That's important, because
15:30 - I need to make sure I shove in the entire
x plus h for x. So the entire x plus h needs
15:36 - to be subtracted, not just the x part, so
the parentheses are mandatory. Similarly,
15:42 - the parentheses here signal that the entire
x plus h is squared as it needs to be, I'm
15:46 - going to go ahead and simplify a bit right
now, I can multiply out the x plus h squared,
15:56 - I can go ahead and distribute the negative
sign. So if I multiply out, I'm gonna get
16:04 - x squared plus XH plus h x plus h squared.
Now I can distribute the two to get to x squared
16:16 - plus 2x H plus two h x plus two h squared
minus x minus h plus three, these two terms
16:23 - are actually the same, I can add them up to
get 4x H. And I think that's as simple as
16:32 - I can get that part. Now, I'm going to write
out F of x plus h minus f of x. So that's
16:39 - going to be this thing right here, minus f
of x. Again, I need to put the F of X formula
16:47 - in parentheses to make sure I subtract the
whole thing. I'll distribute the negative.
16:52 - And now I noticed that a bunch of things cancel
out. So the 2x squared and the minus 2x squared
16:59 - add to zero, the minus x and the x add to
zero,
17:04 - and the three and the minus three, add to
zero. So I'm left with 4x H plus two h squared
17:15 - minus h. Finally, I'll write out the whole
difference quotient by dividing everything
17:22 - by H. I can simplify this further, because
notice that there's an H in every single term
17:28 - of the numerator. If I factor out this H,
H times 4x, plus two h minus one divided by
17:36 - h, these two H's cancel, and I'm left with
a difference quotient of 4x plus two h minus
17:43 - one. This difference quotient will become
important in calculus, when we calculate the
17:49 - difference quotient for smaller and smaller
values of h, eventually letting h go to zero,
17:53 - and ending up with an expression that has
no H's in it, and represents the derivative
17:59 - or slope of the function itself. In this video,
we use the formula f of b minus F of A over
18:06 - B minus A to calculate an average rate of
change, and the related formula f of x plus
18:13 - h minus f of x over h to calculate and simplify
a difference quotient. This video will introduce
18:22 - the idea of limits through some graphs and
examples. When I worked in San Francisco,
18:28 - I used to eat at Julia sushi and salad bar
that had an interesting price structure, the
18:34 - food there cost $10 a pound. But if you happen
to load up your plate to exactly one pound,
18:39 - you got a free lunch. So let's let y equals
f of x represent the price of your lunch in
18:45 - dollars as a function of its weight x in pounds.
And I want to write an equation to describe
18:52 - f of x as a piecewise defined function. It
makes sense to use a piecewise defined function.
18:59 - Because there are two situations, the weight
x could be exactly one pound, or it could
19:06 - be different from one pound. If the weight
is exactly one pound, then f of x The price
19:13 - is zero. But if x is different from a pound,
then the price is 10 times x as a graph, my
19:24 - function is going to follow the line y equals
10x. But when x is exactly one, my function
19:32 - is going to have a value of zero and not 10.
The open circle here represents a hole or
19:39 - a place where a point is missing on the graph.
Now when x is near one, but not equal to one,
19:46 - then the F of X values that is the y values
are very close to 10. In the language of limits,
19:55 - we say that the limit as x approaches one
of F have x is equal to Ted. More informally,
20:05 - we can write, as x approaches one, f of x
approaches 10. Notice that the value of f
20:15 - at one is actually equal to zero, not 10.
And so the limit of f of x as x goes to one,
20:24 - and the value of f at one, are not equal.
This illustrates the important fact that the
20:32 - limit here as x goes to one doesn't care about
the value of f, at one, it only cares about
20:38 - the value of f, when x is near one, in general,
for any function f of x, and for real numbers,
20:46 - a and L, the limit as x goes to a of f of
x equals L means that f of x gets arbitrarily
20:56 - close to L, as x gets arbitrarily close to
a, in other words, as x heads towards a, f
21:05 - of x heads towards L. Let me draw this as
a picture. In this picture, I can say that
21:12 - the limit as x goes to a of f of x is L. Because
by taking a sufficiently small interval around
21:22 - a of x values, I can guarantee that my y values,
my f of x values lie in an arbitrarily small
21:32 - interval around L. Now the limit doesn't care
about s value at exactly a. So if I change
21:39 - the function, if I change the functions value
at a, or even leave the function undefined
21:47 - at a, the limit is still L. But the limit
does care about what happens for x values
21:55 - on both sides of a.
21:56 - If, for example, the function didn't even
exist for x values bigger than a, then we
22:03 - could no longer say that the limit, as x approached
a was out, the limit would not exist. In other
22:11 - words, the limit of f of x is L, only if the
y values are approaching now, as x approaches
22:18 - a from both the left and the right. For the
function g of x graph below, the limit as
22:28 - x goes to two of g of x does not exist. Because
the y values approach one as the x values
22:37 - approach two from the left and the y values
approach three, as the x values approach two
22:43 - from the right. Although the limit doesn't
exist, we can say that the left sided limit
22:51 - exists. And we write this as limit as x goes
to two from the left of g of x is equal to
23:00 - one. The superscript minus sign here means
that x is going to two from the left side.
23:09 - In other words, the x values are less than
two and approaching two. Similarly, we can
23:17 - talk about right sided limits. In this example,
the limit as x goes to two from the right
23:24 - side of g of x is three. And here, the superscript
plus side means that we're approaching two
23:32 - from the right side. In other words, our x
values are greater than to and approaching
23:37 - to. In general, the limit as x goes to a minus
of f of x equals L means that f of x approaches
23:46 - L, as x approaches a from the left, and the
limit as x goes to a plus of f of x equals
23:55 - our means that f of x approaches our as x
approaches a from the right limits from the
24:03 - left or from the right are also called one
sided limits. In this last example, let's
24:11 - look at the behavior of y equals h of x graph
below when x is near negative two. As x approaches
24:21 - negative two from the right, our Y values
are getting arbitrarily large, larger than
24:26 - any real number we might choose. We can write
this in terms of limits by saying the limit
24:33 - as x goes to negative two from the right of
h of x is equal to infinity. As x approaches
24:42 - negative two from the left, the y values are
getting smaller. In fact, they go below any
24:48 - negative real number we might choose. In terms
of limits, we can say that the limit as x
24:55 - goes to negative two from the left of h of
x is negative infinity. In this example, the
25:03 - limit of h of x as x goes to negative two,
not specifying from the left or the right
25:10 - means we have to approach negative two from
both sides. And so this limit does not exist,
25:15 - because the limits from the left and the limit
from the right are heading in opposite directions.
25:21 - I want to mention that some people say that
the limits from the right and the limits from
25:24 - the left also do not exist. Because the functions
don't approach any finite number. I prefer
25:32 - to say that these limits do not exist as a
finite number. But they do exist as infinity
25:40 - and negative infinity. This video introduced
the idea of limits, and one sided limits and
25:49 - infinite limits. This video gives some examples
of when limits fail to exist. For this function,
25:57 - f of x graph below, let's look at the behavior
of f of x in terms of limits, as x approaches
26:03 - negative one, one, and two. Let's start with
x approaching negative one. When x approaches
26:12 - negative one from the last, the y value is
going to be approaching about one half. When
26:23 - x approaches negative one from the right,
the y values sandvi, approaching one. So when
26:32 - x approaches negative one, and we don't specify
from either the left or the right, we can
26:38 - only say that the limit does not exist, because
these two limits from the left and right are
26:44 - not equal.
26:48 - Now let's look at the limit as x is approaching
one. This time, we approach from the left,
26:55 - we get a limiting y value of two, we approach
from the right, the y values are going towards
27:02 - two. So both of these left and right limits
are equal to
27:06 - and therefore the limit as x goes to one of
f of x equals two. That's true, even though
27:14 - f of one f of one itself does not exist. The
limit doesn't care what happens at exactly
27:30 - x equals one just what happens when x is near
one.
27:35 - Finally, let's look at the limit as x goes
to two. So here on the left side, the limit
27:44 - is going to negative infinity. And on the
right side, it's negative infinity. So we
27:49 - can say the limit as x goes to two is negative
infinity. Or we can also say that the limit
27:56 - as x goes to two does not exist. This is the
correct answer. This is a better answer because
28:03 - it carries more information. What values of
x does a limit of f of x fail to exist? Well,
28:12 - let's see. Negative one and two are the only
two values. Let's talk about the ways that
28:23 - limits can fail to exist, we've seen at least
a couple different ways. So we've seen examples
28:29 - where the limit from the left is not equal
to the limit from the right. Here's our number
28:39 - a where we're calculating the limit at. So
that's one example we've seen. We've also
28:45 - seen examples where they're vertical asymptotes.
There's a vertical asymptote here at a, that
28:53 - limit fails to exist because of the unbounded
behavior because the y values are going off
28:58 - to infinity. There's one other way that limits
can fail to exist that comes up, sometimes
29:06 - not quite as frequently. And that's wild behavior.
Not a technical term,
29:13 - just to descriptive term.
29:14 - Let's look at an example that has this wild
behavior, forcing a limit not to exist. And
29:21 - the one of the most classic examples as the
limit as x goes to zero of sine pi over x
29:27 - or sometimes you'll see sine one over x. If
you graph this on your graphing calculator
29:34 - and zoom in near x equals zero, you're gonna
see something that looks roughly like this.
29:50 - It just keeps oscillating up and down and
up and down, as x goes towards zero As x goes
30:00 - towards zero, pi over x is getting bigger
and bigger. And you're going to go through
30:07 - these oscillations between one and negative
one for the faster and faster.
30:13 - From the other side, when x is negative, you'll
see a similar kind of behavior just oscillating
30:18 - faster and faster. As x goes to zero,
30:24 - here, this top values up here at one, and
the bottom value of these are all supposed
30:29 - to hit it negative one. Now, when you try
to decide what the limit is, as x goes to
30:34 - zero, well, the y values are going through
all possible real numbers and between negative
30:40 - one and one infinitely often as x goes to
zero, so there's no single number that the
30:46 - limit can settle at. And so the limit as x
goes to zero, of sine pi over x does not exist.
30:56 - In this video, we saw three types of examples
when limits fail to exist, they can fail to
31:03 - exist because the one sided limits on the
left and the right are not equal. Or they
31:11 - can fail to exist because of vertical asymptotes.
Also, limits can fail to exist when there's
31:19 - wild behavior. And the function fails to settle
down at any single value. This video is about
31:30 - limit laws, rules for finding the limits of
sums, differences, products, and quotients
31:36 - and functions. Let's start with an example.
Suppose that the limit as x goes to seven
31:41 - of f of x is 30. And the limit as x goes to
seven of g of x is two. What's the limit as
31:48 - x goes to seven of f of x divided by negative
three times g of
31:52 - x.
31:54 - Wilson's f of x is heading towards 30. And
g of x is heading towards two, it makes sense
32:00 - that the quotient should head towards 30 divided
by negative three times two, or negative five.
32:10 - in calculating this limit, by plugging in
numbers for the components, we were actually
32:14 - using the limit loss, which are now state.
Suppose that c is a constant, just some number,
32:22 - and that the limits as x goes to a of f of
x and g of x exist as finite numbers that
32:28 - is not as limits that are infinity or negative
infinity. Then the limit of the sum f of x
32:35 - plus g of x is equal to the limit of f of
x plus the limit of g of x. In other words,
32:46 - the limit of the sum is the sum of the limits.
Similarly, the limit of the difference is
32:52 - the difference of the limits. The limit of
C times f of x is just c times the limit of
33:01 - f of x. And the limit of the product is the
product of the limits. The limit of the quotient
33:12 - is the quotient of the limits, provided that
the limit of g of x is not equal to zero.
33:19 - Since we can't divide by zero. Let's use these
limit laws in an example, to find the limit
33:27 - as x goes to two of x squared plus 3x plus
six divided by x plus nine. Well, the limit
33:34 - rule about quotients allows us to rewrite
this limit of a quotient as a quotient of
33:40 - limits, provided that the limits of the numerator
and denominator exist, and that the limit
33:46 - of the denominator is not zero. But we'll
see in a moment that these conditions do in
33:50 - fact hold. Next, we can use the limit rule
about sums to rewrite the numerator as a sum
33:56 - of limits. And we can rewrite the limit in
the denominator also as a sum of limits. Next,
34:06 - we can use the limit rule about products to
rewrite the limit of x squared as the square
34:12 - of the limit. That's because x squared is
really x times x. And so the limit of x squared
34:23 - is really the limit of x times x, which by
the product rule is a limit of x times the
34:32 - limit of x, which is the limit of x quantity
squared. Going back to the original problem,
34:42 - we can now use the limit rule about multiplying
by a constant to rewrite the limit of three
34:48 - times x as three times the limit of x. And
I'll just carry the rest forward. Now that
35:00 - we've got things broken down into bite sized
pieces, we can start evaluating some limits.
35:05 - Notice that the limit as x goes to two of
x is just two, because as x heads towards
35:13 - 2x, heads towards two, so we can replace all
these limits of access by just the number
35:21 - two. So we get two squared plus three times
two. Now notice that the limit as x goes to
35:30 - two of six, well, six doesn't have any x's
in it. So as x two heads towards to six days
35:38 - at six, and the limit here is just six. So
in my original problem, I can replace the
35:44 - set limit of six with six. And on the denominator
here, I get to plus nine. And after a little
35:52 - arithmetic, this simplifies to 16/11. Notice
that we could have gotten this answer a lot
35:59 - faster, just by substituting in the value
of two into our original expression. And in
36:06 - fact, that's the beauty of the lemon laws,
they allow us to evaluate limits of rational
36:12 - functions, just by plugging in the number
that x is going towards, as long as plugging
36:18 - in that number doesn't make the denominator
zero. It's not nearly so simple. When plugging
36:25 - in the value does make the done at zero. And
in the future, we'll build up a bunch of algebraic
36:30 - techniques for handling the situation. In
this video, we've talked about the limit loss.
36:37 - It's important to note, these limit laws only
apply if the limits of the component functions
36:44 - actually exist as finite numbers.
36:49 - If the limit of one or both of the component
functions don't exist, then a limit rules
36:56 - just simply don't apply. And instead, we have
to use other techniques to try to evaluate
37:02 - the limit of a sum, difference product or
quotient. This video is about the squeeze
37:08 - theorem, which is another method for finding
limits. Let's start with an example. Suppose
37:15 - we have a function g of x. We don't know much
about it. But we do know that for x value
37:21 - is near one, g of x is greater than or equal
to four times the square root of x drawn here
37:27 - in red, and less than or equal to 3x squared
minus 4x plus five, drawn here in blue. So
37:36 - on the picture, G has to lie between the red
and the blue curves for x values near one,
37:42 - it could look something like this. What can
we say about the limit of g of x as x goes
37:48 - to one? Well, if you notice, the red curve
and the blue curve have the exact same limit
37:55 - of four as x goes to one. And since the green
curve is squeezed in between the red and the
38:02 - blue curve, its limit must also be for this
example as a special case of the squeeze theorem.
38:10 - Now, let's say the squeeze theorem in general,
suppose that we have three functions, f of
38:16 - x g of x and h of x. And let's suppose that
f of x is less than or equal to g of x, which
38:24 - is less than or equal to h of x, at least
for x values near some number A. this inequality
38:33 - doesn't necessarily have to hold for x equal
to a, because we're going to be talking about
38:40 - limits. And limits don't care what happens
when x is exactly a just when x is near a.
38:48 - Let's suppose also, that like in the previous
example, f of x and h of x have the exact
38:54 - same limit as x approaches a. So we're going
to suppose that the limit as x goes to a of
39:01 - f of x is equal to the limit as x goes to
a of h of x. And we'll call this limit. Now.
39:12 - The picture looks a lot like the previous
example. Again, it doesn't matter exactly
39:17 - what happens at x equals a, for example, g
of x could have a hole there. And its value
39:23 - could be for example, way up here. Since g
of x is trapped here in between f of x and
39:30 - h of x, which both have the same limit l at
a, we can conclude that the limit as x goes
39:38 - to a of g of x is equal to l also. And that's
the squeeze theorem, also known as the pinching
39:48 - theorem, and the sandwich theorem, three very
descriptive names that capture the idea of
39:53 - geovax being trapped here, in between lower
and upper bounds. Now let's use the squeeze
39:59 - there. To find the limit as x goes to zero
of x squared sine one over x. Now, you might
40:06 - remember that sine one over x by itself has
this crazy oscillating behavior. In fact,
40:13 - the limit as x goes to zero of sine one over
x does not exist, because the function never
40:20 - settles down to a single finite value. At
first glance, you might think the limit of
40:27 - x squared sine of one over x also wouldn't
exist. In fact, it's tempting to try to use
40:33 - the product rule and say that the limit of
the product is the product of the limits.
40:41 - But in fact, the product rule only applies
when the component limits both exist. And
40:47 - since the second limit doesn't exist, the
product rule tells us absolutely nothing about
40:52 - whether the limit that we're interested in
exists or doesn't. So we can't use the product
40:59 - rule. But it turns out, we can use the squeeze
theorem. Now this example is a little trickier
41:05 - than the first example, because in the first
example, we were told what the upper and lower
41:10 - bounding functions should be. And in this
example, we have to come up with. But if we
41:15 - look at a graph of x squared sine one over
x, we can see that it does seem to be trapped
41:21 - in an envelope here.
41:25 - Let's use algebra to see what those two bounding
functions might be. Now we know that sine
41:30 - of one over x is always between one and negative
one, just because sine of anything has between
41:37 - one and negative one. And if we multiply this
whole inequality by x squared, we get minus
41:43 - x squared is less than or equal to x squared,
sine one over x, which is less than or equal
41:49 - to x squared. Notice that x squared is always
positive, so we don't have to worry about
41:55 - flipping any of the inequality signs when
we multiply by this positive number. So x
42:02 - squared and minus x squared are good bounding
functions. And if we notice that the limit
42:07 - as x goes to zero of x squared is zero, and
the limit as x goes to zero of negative x
42:15 - squared is also zero, we can conclude by the
squeeze theorem, that the limit as x goes
42:21 - to zero of x squared, sine of one over x is
also zero, because it squeezed in between
42:31 - these two functions with the same limit. the
squeeze theorem is a great trick for evaluating
42:37 - limits when you happen to have a function
that you're interested in, trapped in between
42:41 - two other functions with the same limit. The
example in this video is a classic example,
42:48 - where we have a crazy oscillating trig function,
multiplied by a power of x, that x is one
42:53 - of our bounding functions. In this video,
we'll compute a bunch of limits using algebraic
43:01 - tricks. All these limits are of the zero over
zero indeterminate form kind. Recall that
43:09 - this means that the limits are of the form
the limit of f of x over g of x where the
43:18 - limit of f of x equals zero and the limit
of g of x also equals zero. For a first example,
43:25 - let's look at the limit as x goes to one of
x cubed minus one over x squared minus one.
43:32 - Notice that the numerator and the denominator
are both going to zero as x goes to one. To
43:37 - calculate this limit, we want to simplify
this expression. And one way to simplify it
43:42 - is to factor it. So let's rewrite this as
the limit as x goes to one of x minus one
43:49 - times x squared plus x plus one. We're factoring
the numerator here is a difference of cubes.
43:58 - We can also factor the denominator as a difference
of squares, x minus one times x plus one.
44:07 - Now, as long as x is not equal to one, we
can cancel out these two factors of x minus
44:17 - one. And so the limit of this expression is
just the same as the limit of this expression.
44:29 - Now we can just plug in one, because plugging
in one gives us a numerator of three and a
44:36 - denominator of two. And that way, we've evaluated
our limits. Next, let's look at the limit
44:45 - of five minus z quantity squared minus 25.
All divided by z. Once again, when we plug
44:53 - in x equals zero in the numerator, we get
zero and then nominator we also get zero.
45:03 - This time instead of factoring, the trick
is going to be to multiply out. So let's rewrite
45:08 - this limit as the limit as t goes to zero
45:13 - of
45:14 - 25 minus 10 z plus z squared minus 25. I just
distributed to get this expression divided
45:27 - by z. Since 25 minus 25 is zero, I just have
the limit as t goes to zero of negative 10
45:42 - z plus c squared over
45:44 - z.
45:45 - Now what? Well, I could factor out the Z here.
One z is not zero, I can cancel here. So my
46:01 - original limit is the same as this limit.
Plugging in z equals zero, I just get negative
46:11 - 10 as my answer. This third example is also
a situation where the numerator is going to
46:20 - zero, and the denominator is also going to
zero. In this case, I'm going to try to simplify
46:25 - the expression by adding together the fractions
and the numerator. So I'll need a common denominator,
46:32 - which is r plus three, times three. So rewriting,
I get the limit of one over r plus three,
46:46 - I multiply that by three over three, in order
to get the appropriate common denominator,
46:53 - minus 1/3, which I have to multiply by R plus
three over r plus three, all that over are
47:05 - continuing to rewrite, I have in the numerator,
adding together these fractions mature, have
47:13 - the denominator of R plus three times three,
I get three minus quantity r plus three. And
47:26 - then this entire fraction is still divided
by our distributing the negative sign, I have
47:31 - three minus r minus three divided by R plus
three times three, all divided by R. three
47:42 - minus three is zero. So I can rewrite this
as negative r over r plus three, times three.
47:52 - And now instead of dividing by r, which is
r of r one, I can multiply by the reciprocal,
47:58 - one over R. R divided by R is one. So this
expression simplifies to negative one, over
48:11 - r plus three, times three. So finally, I'm
in a good position, because now I can just
48:18 - go ahead and let our go to zero. And by plugging
in R equals zero, I have a limit of negative
48:26 - one over zero plus three times three, or negative
one, nine. This example is a little tricky,
48:35 - because involve square roots can be hard to
deal with. Well, there's one nice trick for
48:40 - dealing with square roots that works here,
which is the conjugate. So I'm going to take
48:46 - the expression that we're given, and multiply
by the conjugate of the numerator, in this
48:53 - case, because the numerator is the place where
the square root is by the conjugate of A minus
49:02 - B, I just mean a plus b conjugate of A plus
B is a minus b. Well, of course, if I multiply
49:08 - on the numerator, by something, I also have
to multiply the denominator by the same thing,
49:15 - so that I won't alter the value of the expression.
So this limit here is equal to the limit of
49:24 - the expression down here that looks more complicated,
than in a moment, if we're lucky, things will
49:32 - clear up and become simpler. So Multiplying
the numerators across, I get the square root
49:37 - of x plus three squared.
49:42 - I get
49:44 - plus two times the square root of x plus three
minus two times the square root of x plus
49:51 - three minus four. On the denominator, I get
x times the square root of x plus three
49:59 - plus
50:02 - 2x minus the square root of x plus three minus
two. Let's see what simplifies here. So the
50:16 - square root of x plus three squared is just
x plus three. And I see that this expression
50:25 - and this expression are opposites, so they
subtract to zero here. So on the numerator,
50:31 - I just have x plus three, and then I still
have the minus four on the denominator, nominator
50:37 - looks a little messy. I'll just copy it over
for now. Okay, so on my numerator, I'm getting
50:46 - x minus one. Notice that when x goes to one,
that numerator is still going to zero. And
50:53 - in fact, as I let x go to one, that denominator,
if I plug in here, everything is gonna also
51:00 - cancel out to zero. So I still got a zero
over zero indeterminate form. But maybe I
51:08 - can use one of the previous tricks of factoring.
Because look at here, if I factor an X out
51:15 - of these two expressions as a square root
of x plus three out of these two expressions,
51:20 - and I could maybe factor a two out of these
two, factoring by grouping, let's try that.
51:28 - So we have x squared of x plus three times
x minus one from these two expressions, and
51:42 - then I have a plus two times x minus one.
From these two expressions, this is looking
51:53 - promising. So now I've got an x minus one
on the top. And if I factor out the x minus
52:02 - one from each of these two expressions, I'm
going to have an x minus one on the bottom
52:11 - times the square root of x plus three, plus
two. Now, for x values near one, but not equal
52:22 - to one, I can cancel those. And my limit simplifies
to just one over square root of x plus three
52:32 - plus two, plugging in one, I get a one on
the numerator, and square root of four, which
52:39 - is two plus two, four on the denominator,
and we have calculated this limit. Last example
52:49 - here, another zero over zero indeterminate
form. Anytime I see an absolute value, I'm
52:57 - going to want to take cases, because the absolute
value of X plus five naturally follows in
53:05 - the cases, if X plus five is greater than
zero, in other words, x is greater than negative
53:13 - five, then the absolute value of this positive
number is just
53:18 - itself.
53:21 - On the other hand, if X plus five is less
than zero, in other words, x is less than
53:26 - negative five, than the absolute value of
a negative number is its opposite. And we
53:31 - make the expression x plus five, turn it into
its opposite by putting a negative sign in
53:37 - front. Now let's look at one sided limits.
As x goes to negative five from the left,
53:46 - we have
53:47 - a situation where x is less than negative
five, this situation right here. And so we
53:57 - can rewrite the absolute value by taking the
negative of the expression. We still have
54:02 - a zero over zero and determinant form. But
if we use the old factoring trick,
54:10 - factor out a two cancel, we got the limit
of two over negative one, which is just negative
54:29 - two.
54:31 - We do the same exercise on the right side.
When we're on the right, then x is greater
54:43 - than negative five. So we're in this situation
here, where we can just replace the absolute
54:48 - value with the stuff inside and again factoring
the numerator and canceling the X plus five
55:02 - We just get a limit
55:03 - of two.
55:06 - So we have a left limit, and a right limit
that are different. And so in this example,
55:14 - the limit does not exist. So we've seen a
five different kinds of limits all of the
55:23 - zero or zero indeterminate form. And we've
used five different methods to evaluate them.
55:30 - For the first example, we use factoring. For
the second example, do the opposite of factoring,
55:38 - we multiplied out. For the third example,
we added together our rational expressions
55:46 - to simplify things. The next example uses
the old multiply by the conjugate trick. And
55:57 - the last example, we used cases and looked
at one sided limits.
56:07 - The limit law about quotients tells us that
the limit of the quotient is the question
56:12 - of the limit, provided that the limits of
the component functions actually exist, and
56:19 - that the limit of the function on the denominator
is not equal to zero. But what happens if
56:24 - the limit of the function on the denominator
is equal to zero? This video will begin to
56:30 - answer that question. In fact, there are two
different situations we'll want to consider.
56:37 - It could be that even though the limit on
the denominator is equal to zero,
56:45 - the limit on the numerator exists and is not
equal to zero. Or it could happen that both
56:54 - limits are zero. We'll focus on the first
situation, first starting with an example.
57:02 - And we'll look at the second situation later
on.
57:05 - In this example, the limit of the numerator,
negative 4x is just negative 12, which we
57:16 - can see by plugging in three for x. But the
limit as x goes to three of the denominator
57:23 - is zero. So we're exactly in one of these
situations where the numerator goes to a finite
57:28 - nonzero number, but the denominator goes to
zero. Let's see what happens as we approach
57:37 - three from the left first. As we approach
three from the left, x is going through numbers
57:48 - that are slightly less than three numbers
like 2.9 2.99 2.999, and so on. If we plug
57:58 - in those numbers into the expression, here
on our calculator, we didn't get answers of
58:05 - 116 1196, and 11,996. If even without a calculator,
we could approximate these answers pretty
58:23 - closely by just thinking about the fact that
since x is very close to three, the numerator
58:30 - is about negative four times three, so about
negative 12. The denominator 2.9 minus three
58:37 - is negative 0.1. That quotient of two negative
numbers gives us a positive value of 120.
58:47 - Similarly, we could approximate the value
when x is 2.9 times as almost negative 12
58:55 - divided by 0.01, which is 1200. And approximate
the third value as 12,000. Either way, we
59:08 - do it exact answers on our calculator or approximations
in our head when noticing that these values
59:16 - are positive numbers that are getting larger
and larger as x goes towards three from the
59:21 - left. This makes sense. Because if we look
at our expression, as x goes towards three
59:28 - from the left, the numerator is getting close
to negative 12, which is a negative number.
59:35 - And the denominator, since x is less than
three will always be a small negative number,
59:41 - negative over negative is a positive. And
as x is getting really close to three, those
59:47 - denominators are getting smaller and therefore
the fractions are getting bigger and bigger
59:50 - in magnitude. So we can conclude that our
limit is positive infinity. We can make a
59:58 - similar argument By looking at the limit,
as x goes to three from the positive side,
60:08 - it's supposed to be an X minus three here.
So now x is going through a value is slightly
60:19 - bigger than three 3.1 3.01 3.01. And again,
we can plug directly into our calculator and
60:29 - figure out the answers are negative 124. Negative
1204, negative 12,004. Or we can make a similar
60:43 - approximating argument. This answer is approximately
negative 12 over a positive point one, which
60:51 - is negative 120, and so on. Like before, if
we consider the signs of our numerator and
61:01 - denominator, we can see that as x goes to
three, our numerator is a negative number.
61:08 - But our denominator is a positive number,
since we're approaching three from the right
61:11 - where x is bigger than three, and therefore,
our quotient is a negative number, it's still
61:17 - getting bigger and bigger in magnitude as
x goes towards three, because the denominator
61:22 - is still getting tinier and tinier, while
the numerator stays pretty close to negative
61:27 - 12. So in this case, we're getting a negative
number that's bigger and bigger magnitude,
61:33 - so that makes a limit of negative infinity.
Now, since our limit on the left is infinity,
61:43 - and our limit on the right is negative infinity,
the only thing we can say about the limit
61:48 - as x goes to three
61:49 - is that it does not exist. Now let's look
at another example. The limit as x goes to
62:02 - negative four of 5x, over the absolute value
of x plus four, notice that the limit of the
62:09 - numerator is just negative 20 by plugging
in negative four for x, and the limit of the
62:18 - denominator is zero. Because we've got an
absolute value in our expression, here, it's
62:28 - screaming out at us to look at cases. Remember
that the absolute value of x plus four is
62:38 - going to equal just x plus four, if x plus
four is positive, in other words, if x is
62:46 - greater than negative four, however, if x
is less than negative four, then the expression
62:54 - x plus four will be negative. So taking the
absolute value has to switch at sign in order
62:59 - to make a negative expression positive. Alright,
so that's going to come in handy when we look
63:07 - at the limit as x goes to negative four, from
the left, and from the right. So when we approach
63:23 - negative four from the left, x is going to
be less than negative four. So we're going
63:29 - to be in this situation here, where the absolute
value gives us the opposite sign. That means
63:42 - that the limit as x goes to negative four
minus of this expression, the same as the
63:51 - limit of 5x over negative x plus four. Now
reasoning as before, as x is going to negative
64:02 - four from the left, the numerator here is
a negative number. Pretty close to negative
64:08 - 20. The denominator, since x is less than
negative 4x plus four is negative, the negative
64:19 - of it is positive. So our quotient is negative.
And since denominator is getting really tiny,
64:28 - while the numerators will pretty level at
at negative 20. This limit is going to be
64:36 - bigger and bigger magnitude a limit of negative
infinity. Now let's look at the limit as x
64:44 - goes to negative four from the right, in this
case, x is just a little bit bigger than negative
64:51 - four. So we're in this case where the absolute
value doesn't change the expression. So we
64:59 - can rewrite this As 5x
65:01 - over x plus four,
65:03 - now the numerator is still gonna be a negative
number, the denominator, since x is slightly
65:10 - bigger than negative four, slightly to the
right, this expression is going to be positive
65:19 - number. Negative or over a positive is a negative.
And again, since the denominator is getting
65:28 - tiny, the fractions getting huge in magnitude.
And so this limit is negative infinity. Now,
65:34 - in this case, look at what's going on, we've
got a negative infinity limit on the left
65:42 - and a negative infinity limit on the right.
So we can conclude that the limit as x goes
65:47 - to negative four of 5x, over the absolute
value of x plus four is equal to negative
65:54 - infinity. In fact, we can confirm that by
looking at a graph. If we look, check out
66:03 - the graph near x equals negative four, it's
gonna look something like this, with a vertical
66:10 - asymptote at x equals negative four, like
expected. So we've seen that if the limit
66:18 - of f of x is equal to something that's not
zero, and the limit of g of x is equal to
66:23 - zero, then the limit of the quotient could
be negative infinity as it was in the past
66:31 - example. It could also be infinity, or it
could just not exist. supposed to say does
66:43 - not exist, if the one sided limits are infinity
on one side, and negative infinity on the
66:54 - other. Now, what about this second situation
that I mentioned the beginning when the limit
67:02 - of f of x is zero, and the limit of f of g
of x is zero? What can we say about the limit
67:09 - of the quotient in this situation? Well, in
fact, in this situation, the limit of the
67:14 - quotient, it could exist and be any finite
number, or infinity, or minus infinity, or
67:22 - it could not exist at all. In fact, in this
sort of situation, which is called a zero,
67:28 - or zero indeterminate form, anything could
happen. Which makes it in some ways the hardest,
67:36 - but in some ways, the most fun situation of
all. So in another video, we'll talk about
67:42 - techniques for dealing with 00 indeterminate
forms, and how to use algebra and other simplification
67:48 - techniques to evaluate these these mysterious
limits. So in this video, we've looked at
67:57 - the limits of quotients, when the limit of
the denominator is zero. We've done some examples
68:05 - when the limit of the numerator was not zero,
but the limit of the denominator was zero.
68:09 - And we saw that these situations corresponded
to vertical asymptotes, and gave us an answer
68:16 - for the limit of the quotient of infinity,
or negative infinity, or sometimes infinity
68:23 - on one side and negative infinity on the other.
We also hinted at fun things to come when
68:31 - we look at the limits in this situation when
the numerator and the denominator are both
68:35 - heading towards zero. And when anything can
happen. This video is about graphs and equations
68:42 - of lines. Here we're given the graph of a
line, we want to find the equation, one standard
68:50 - format for the equation of a line is y equals
mx plus b. here, m represents the slope, and
68:59 - B represents the y intercept, the y value,
where the line crosses the y axis, the slope
69:08 - is equal to the rise over the run. Or sometimes
this is written as the change in y values
69:15 - over the change in x values. Or in other words,
y two minus y one over x two minus x one,
69:24 - where x one y one and x two y two are points
on the line.
69:31 - While we could use any two points on the line,
to find the slope, it's convenient to use
69:36 - points where the x and y coordinates are integers.
That is points where the line passes through
69:43 - grid points. So here would be one convenient
point to use. And here's another convenient
69:48 - point to use. The coordinates of the first
point are one, two, and the next point this
69:55 - is let's say, five negative one. Now I can
find this slope by looking at the rise over
70:01 - the run. So as I go through a run of this
distance, I go through a rise of that distance,
70:09 - especially gonna be a negative rise or a fall
because my line is pointing down. So let's
70:15 - see counting off squares, this is a run of
1234 squares and a rise of 123. So negative
70:21 - three, so my slope is going to be negative
three, over four. I got that answer by counting
70:32 - squares. But I could have also gotten it by
looking at the difference in my y values over
70:36 - the difference of my x values. That is, I
could have done negative one minus two, that's
70:45 - from my difference in Y values, and divide
that by my difference in x values, which is
70:53 - five minus one, that gives me negative three
over four, as before, so my M is negative
71:02 - three fourths. Now I need to figure out the
value of b, my y intercept, well, I could
71:09 - just read it off the graph, it looks like
approximately 2.75. But if I want to be more
71:14 - accurate, I can again use a point that has
integer coordinates that I know it's exact
71:19 - coordinates. So either this point or that
point, let's try this point. And I can start
71:25 - off with my equation y equals mx plus b, that
is y equals negative three fourths x plus
71:33 - b. And I can plug in the point one, two, for
my x and y. So that gives me two equals negative
71:45 - three fourths times one plus b, solving for
B. Let's see that two equals negative three
71:51 - fourths plus b. So add three fourths to both
sides, that's two plus three fourths equals
71:58 - b. So b is eight fourths plus three fourths,
which is 11 fourths, which is actually just
72:05 - what I eyeballed it today. So now I can write
out my final equation for my line y equals
72:13 - negative three fourths x plus 11 fourths by
plugging in for m and b. Next, let's find
72:20 - the equation for this horizontal line. a horizontal
line has slope zero. So if we think of it
72:28 - as y equals mx plus b, m is going to be zero.
In other words, it's just y equals b, y is
72:35 - some constant. So if we can figure out what
that that constant y value is, it looks like
72:42 - it's to let's see, this three, three and a
half, we can just write down the equation
72:48 - directly, y equals 3.5. For a vertical line,
like this one, it doesn't really have a slope.
72:58 - I mean, if you tried to do the rise over the
run, there's no run. So you'd I guess you'd
73:04 - be divided by zero and get an infinite slope.
But But instead, we just think of it as an
73:09 - equation of the form x equals something. And
in this case, x equals negative two, notice
73:16 - that all of the points on our line have the
same x coordinate of negative two and the
73:21 - y coordinate can be anything. So this is how
we write the equation for a vertical line.
73:29 - In this example, we're not shown a graph of
the line, we're just get told that it goes
73:33 - through two points. But knowing that I go
through two points is enough to find the equation
73:40 - for the line. First, we can find the slope
by taking the difference in Y values over
73:46 - the difference in x values. So that's negative
three minus two over four minus one, which
73:54 - is negative five thirds. So we can use the
standard equation for the line, this is called
74:03 - the slope intercept form.
74:09 - And we can plug in negative five thirds. And
we can use one point, either one will do will
74:17 - still get the same final answer. So let's
use one two and plug that in to get two equals
74:22 - negative five thirds times one plus b. And
so B is two plus five thirds, which is six
74:32 - thirds plus five thirds, which is 11 thirds.
So our equation is y equals negative five
74:37 - thirds x plus 11 thirds. This is method one.
method two uses a slightly different form
74:49 - of the equation. It's called the point slope
form and it goes y minus y naught is equal
74:55 - to m times x minus x naught where x naught
Why not is a point on the line, and again
75:04 - is the slope. So we calculate the slope the
same way, by taking a difference in Y values
75:11 - over a difference in x values. But then we
can simply plug in any point. For example,
75:20 - the point one, two will work, we can plug
one in for x naught and two in for Y not in
75:28 - this point slope form, that gives us y minus
two is equal to minus five thirds x minus
75:38 - one. Notice that these two equations, while
they may look different, are actually equivalent.
75:44 - Because if I distribute the negative five
thirds, and then add the two to both sides,
75:59 - I get the same equation
76:01 - as above.
76:06 - So we've seen two ways of finding the equation
for the line is in the slope intercept form,
76:11 - and using the point slope form. In this video,
we saw that you can find the equation for
76:19 - a line if you know the slope. And you know
one point, you can also find the equation
76:27 - for the line if you know two points, because
you can use the two points to get the slope
76:34 - and then plug in one of those points. To figure
out the rest of the equation. We saw two standard
76:41 - forms for the equation of a line the slope
intercept form y equals mx plus b, where m
76:49 - is the slope, and B is the y intercept. And
the point slope form y minus y naught equals
76:58 - m times x minus x naught, where m again is
the slope and x naught y naught is a point
77:06 - on the line. This video is about rational
functions and their graphs. Recall that a
77:15 - rational function is a function that can be
written as a ratio or quotient of two polynomials.
77:21 - Here's an example. The simpler function, f
of x equals one over x is also considered
77:29 - a rational function, you can think of one
and x as very simple polynomials. The graph
77:36 - of this rational function is shown here. This
graph looks different from the graph of a
77:42 - polynomial. For one thing, its end behavior
is different. The end behavior of a function
77:48 - is the way the graph looks, when x goes through
really large positive, or really large negative
77:54 - numbers, we've seen that the end behavior
of a polynomial always looks like one of these
78:00 - cases. That is why marches off to infinity
or maybe negative infinity, as x gets really
78:06 - big or really negative. But this rational
function has a different type of end behavior.
78:11 - Notice, as x gets really big, the y values
are leveling off at about a y value of three.
78:18 - And similarly, as x values get really negative,
our graph is leveling off near the line y
78:24 - equals three, I'll draw that line, y equals
three on my graph, that line is called a horizontal
78:31 - asymptote. A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal
line that our graph gets closer and closer
78:39 - to as x goes to infinity, or as X goes to
negative infinity or both. There's something
78:45 - else that's different about this graph from
a polynomial graph, look at what happens as
78:50 - x gets close to negative five. As we approach
negative five with x values on the right,
78:56 - our Y values are going down towards negative
infinity. And as we approach the x value of
79:01 - negative five from the left, our Y values
are going up towards positive infinity. We
79:06 - say that this graph has a vertical asymptote
at x equals negative five. vertical asymptote
79:14 - is a vertical line that the graph gets closer
and closer to. Finally, there's something
79:20 - really weird going on at x equals two, there's
a little open circle there, like the value
79:26 - at x equals two is dug out. That's called
a hole. A hole is a place along the curve
79:33 - of the graph where the function doesn't exist.
Now that we've identified some of the features
79:39 - of our rational functions graph, I want to
look back at the equation and see how we could
79:44 - have predicted those features just by looking
at the equation. To find horizontal asymptotes.
79:51 - We need to look at what our function is doing
when x goes through really big positive or
79:55 - really big negative numbers. Looking at our
equation for our function, numerator is going
80:01 - to be dominated by the 3x squared term when
x is really big, right, because three times
80:07 - x squared is going to be absolutely enormous
compared to this negative 12. If x is a big
80:12 - positive or negative number in the denominator,
the denominator will be dominated by the x
80:18 - squared term. Again, if x is a really big
positive or negative number, like a million,
80:23 - a million squared will be much, much bigger
than three times a million or negative 10.
80:29 - For that reason, to find the end behavior,
or the horizontal asymptote, for our function,
80:36 - we just need to look at the terms on the numerator
and the term on the denominator that have
80:42 - the highest exponent, those are the ones that
dominate the expression in size. So as x gets
80:47 - really big, our functions y values are going
to be approximately 3x squared over x squared,
80:55 - which is three. That's why we have a horizontal
asymptote at y equals
80:59 - three. Now our vertical asymptotes, those
tend to occur where our denominator of our
81:07 - function is zero. That's because the function
doesn't exist when our denominator is zero.
81:14 - And when we get close to that place where
our denominator is zero, we're going to be
81:18 - dividing by tiny, tiny numbers, which will
make our Y values really big in magnitude.
81:24 - So to check where our denominators zero, let's
factor our function. In fact, I'm going to
81:28 - go ahead and factor the numerator and the
denominator. So the numerator factors, let's
81:33 - see, pull out the three, I get x squared minus
four, factor in the denominator, that factors
81:40 - into X plus five times x minus two, I can
factor a little the numerator a little further,
81:47 - that's three times x minus two times x plus
two over x plus 5x minus two. Now, when x
81:56 - is equal to negative five, my denominator
will be zero, but my numerator will not be
82:02 - zero. That's what gives me the vertical asymptote
at x equals negative five. Notice that when
82:10 - x equals two, the denominators zero, but the
numerator is also zero. In fact, if I cancelled
82:18 - the x minus two factor from the numerator
and denominator, I get a simplified form for
82:23 - my function that agrees with my original function,
as long as x is not equal to two. That's because
82:33 - when x equals two, the simplified function
exists, but the original function does not
82:38 - it's zero over zero, it's undefined. But for
every other x value, including x values near
82:45 - x equals two, our original function is just
the same as this function. And that's why
82:51 - our function only has a vertical asymptote
at x equals negative five, not one at x equals
82:58 - two, because the x minus two factor is no
longer in the function after simplifying,
83:02 - it does have a hole at x equals two, because
the original function is not defined there,
83:07 - even though the simplified version is if we
want to find the y value of our hole, we can
83:13 - just plug in x equals two into our simplified
version of our function, that gives a y value
83:21 - of three times two plus two over two plus
seven, or 12 ninths, which simplifies to four
83:28 - thirds. So our whole is that to four thirds.
Now that we've been through one example in
83:36 - detail, let's summarize our findings. We find
the vertical asymptotes and the holes by looking
83:44 - where the denominator is zero. The holes happen
where the denominator and numerator are both
83:50 - zero and those factors cancel out. The vertical
asymptotes are all other x values where the
83:57 - denominator is zero, we find the horizontal
asymptotes by considering the highest power
84:03 - term on the numerator and the denominator,
I'll explain this process in more detail in
84:09 - three examples. In the first example, if we
circle the highest power terms, that simplifies
84:17 - to 5x over 3x squared, which is five over
3x. As x gets really big, the denominator
84:25 - is going to be huge. So I'm going to be dividing
five by a huge, huge number, that's going
84:31 - to be going very close to zero, and therefore
we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals
84:37 - zero. In the second example, the highest power
terms, 2x cubed over 3x cubed simplifies to
84:46 - two thirds. So as x gets really big, we're
going to be heading towards two thirds and
84:52 - we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals
two thirds. In the third example, the highest
84:58 - power terms x squared over 2x simplifies to
x over two. As x gets really big, x over two
85:08 - is getting really big. And therefore, we don't
have a horizontal asymptote at all. This is
85:14 - going to infinity, when x gets through goes
through big positive numbers, and is going
85:21 - to negative infinity when x goes through a
big negative numbers. So in this case, the
85:29 - end behavior is kind of like that of a polynomial,
and there's no horizontal asymptote.
85:35 - In general, when the degree of the numerator
is smaller than the degree of the denominator,
85:41 - we're in this first case where the denominator
gets really big compared to the numerator
85:45 - and we go to zero. In the second case, where
the degree of the numerator and the degree
85:51 - of the denominator equal, things cancel out,
and so we get a horizontal asymptote at the
85:57 - y value, that's equal to the ratio of the
leading coefficients. Finally, in the third
86:05 - case, when the degree of the numerator is
bigger than the degree of the denominator,
86:09 - then the numerator is getting really big compared
to the denominator, so we end up with no horizontal
86:15 - asymptote. Finally, let's apply all these
observations to one more example. Please pause
86:22 - the video and take a moment to find the vertical
asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes and holes
86:27 - for this rational function. To find the vertical
asymptotes and holes, we need to look at where
86:33 - the denominator is zero. In fact, it's going
to be handy to factor both the numerator and
86:38 - the denominator. Since there if there are
any common factors, we might have a hole instead
86:42 - of a vertical asymptote. The numerator is
pretty easy to factor. Let's see, that's 3x
86:49 - times x plus one for the denominator, first
factor out an x. And then I'll factor some
86:56 - more using a guess and check method. I know
that I'll need a 2x and an X to multiply together
87:06 - to the to x squared, and I'll need a three
and a minus one or also minus three and a
87:12 - one. Let's see if that works. If I multiply
out 2x minus one times x plus three, that
87:20 - does give me back my 2x squared plus 5x minus
three, so that checks out. Now, I noticed
87:26 - that I have a common factor of x in both the
numerator and the denominator. So that's telling
87:31 - me I'm going to have a hole at x equals zero.
In fact, I could rewrite my rational function
87:39 - by cancelling out that common factor, and
that's equivalent, as long as x is not equal
87:44 - to zero. So the y value of my
87:47 - whole
87:48 - is what I get when I plug zero into my simplified
version, that would be three times zero plus
87:55 - one over two times zero minus one times zero
plus three, which is three over negative three
88:02 - or minus one. So my whole is at zero minus
one. Now all the remaining places in my denominator
88:10 - that make my denominator zero will get me
vertical asymptotes. So I'll have a vertical
88:15 - asymptote, when 2x minus one times x plus
three equals zero, that is, when 2x minus
88:25 - one is zero, or x plus three is zero. In other
words, when x is one half, or x equals negative
88:34 - three. Finally, to find my horizontal asymptotes,
I just need to consider the highest power
88:42 - term in the numerator and the denominator.
That simplifies to three over 2x, which is
88:50 - bottom heavy, right? When x gets really big,
this expression is going to zero. And that
88:56 - means that we have a horizontal asymptote
at y equals zero. So we found the major features
89:03 - of our graph, the whole, the vertical asymptotes
and the horizontal asymptotes. Together, this
89:09 - would give us a framework for what the graph
of our function looks like. horizontal asymptote
89:15 - at y equals zero, vertical asymptotes at x
equals one half, and x equals minus three
89:23 - at a hole at the point zero minus one. plotting
a few more points, or using a graphing calculator
89:31 - of graphing program, we can see that our actual
function will look something like this. Notice
89:39 - that the x intercept when x is negative one
corresponds to where the numerator of our
89:46 - rational function or reduced rational function
is equal to zero. That's because a zero on
89:51 - the numerator that doesn't make the denominator
zero makes the whole function zero. And an
89:56 - X intercept is where the y value of the whole
function is zero. In this video, we learned
90:02 - how to find horizontal asymptotes of rational
functions. By looking at the highest power
90:07 - terms, we learned to find the vertical asymptotes
and holes. By looking at the factored version
90:13 - of the functions, the holes correspond to
the x values that make the numerator and denominator
90:19 - zero, his corresponding factors cancel. The
vertical asymptotes correspond to the x values
90:27 - that make the denominator zero, even after
factoring any any common any common factors
90:32 - in the numerator denominator. This video focuses
on the behavior of functions and graphs, as
90:39 - x goes through arbitrarily large positive
and negative values. You may have touched
90:45 - on these ideas before in the past when you
studied horizontal asymptotes. But in this
90:50 - video, we'll talk about the same ideas in
the language of limits. In this first example,
90:56 - what happens to the function f of x drawn
below as x go through larger and larger positive
91:02 - numbers? Well, the arrow here on the end is
supposed to mean the trend continues. So as
91:07 - x gets bigger and bigger, the values of y,
that is f of x, get closer and closer to one,
91:14 - we can write this in the language of limits
by saying the limit as x goes to infinity
91:21 - of f of x is equal to one. Now what happens
to this function as x goes through larger
91:28 - and larger negative numbers, by larger and
larger negative numbers, I mean numbers that
91:33 - are negative but are larger and larger in
magnitude. So for example, negative five,
91:38 - negative 10, negative 100, and negative a
million and so on. Well, assuming this trend
91:45 - continues, it looks like f of x, even though
it's oscillating, it's settling down at a
91:50 - value of two. So we say that the limit as
x goes to negative infinity, of f of x equals
91:59 - to limits in which x goes to infinity, or
negative infinity are called limits at infinity.
92:08 - The phrase limits at infinity should be contrasted
with the phrase infinite limits. An infinite
92:15 - limit means that the y values, or the F of
X values go to infinity, or negative infinity.
92:25 - limits and infinity correspond to horizontal
asymptotes, as drawn above, while infinite
92:31 - limits correspond to vertical asymptotes.
The only exception to this when we don't have
92:36 - a horizontal or vertical asymptote is when
x and f of x are both going infinite at the
92:41 - same time, we'll see an example of this on
the next page. Let's figure out the limits
92:47 - of infinity for these two functions, g of
x and h of x. The function g of x is actually
92:54 - the function e to the minus x, and it has
a horizontal asymptote, heading right here
93:01 - at y equals zero. So the limit as x goes to
infinity of g of x equals zero. But as we
93:11 - head to the left, and x goes through larger
and larger negative values, our Y values don't
93:17 - settle down to a particular finite value,
they get arbitrarily large. And so we say
93:23 - that the limit as x goes to minus infinity
of g of x is equal to infinity. Now let's
93:31 - look at the graph of y equals h of x. Please
pause the video for a moment and try to figure
93:35 - out the limits of infinity for this function.
The limit as x goes to infinity of h of x
93:43 - is negative infinity. Because as x goes to
infinity, the y values get below or more negative
93:52 - than any finite number. Now as X goes to negative
infinity, the y values oscillate, and never
94:00 - settle down at a particular number. So we
say that the limit as x goes to minus infinity
94:07 - of h of x does not exist. Finally, let's look
at some limits of infinity of functions without
94:14 - looking at their graphs first, to find the
limit as x goes to infinity of one over x.
94:21 - Let's think about what happens to one over
x. As x gets bigger and bigger through positive
94:26 - numbers. As x gets bigger and bigger, one
over x gets smaller and smaller. So the limit
94:36 - as x goes to infinity of one over x equals
zero. To find the limit of one over x as x
94:43 - goes to negative infinity, let's look at what
happens as X goes to negative numbers that
94:48 - are larger and larger in magnitude. Now one
of our x goes through numbers that are negative,
94:57 - but they're still getting smaller and smaller.
magnitude. So the limit as x goes to negative
95:04 - infinity of one over x is also zero. We can
use similar reasoning to find the limit as
95:11 - x goes to infinity of one over x cubed. As
x goes to infinity, x cubed also goes to infinity.
95:19 - So one of our x cubed has to go to zero. To
find the limit as x goes to infinity of one
95:26 - over the square root of x, notice that as
x goes to infinity, the square root of x still
95:32 - goes to infinity. So one over the square root
of x also goes to zero. In other words, both
95:40 - of these limits are equal to zero. Both of
these examples are actually closely related,
95:47 - because both have the form of the limit as
x goes to infinity of one over x to the R,
95:54 - where R is a number greater than zero. In
the second example, the square root of x is
96:00 - really x to the R, where R is one half. In
fact, the limit as x goes to infinity of one
96:09 - over x to the R is always equal to zero. Whenever
R is bigger than zero, we can even say the
96:17 - same thing about the limit as x goes to negative
infinity of one over x to the R. As long as
96:25 - we avoid exponents, like one half that don't
make sense for negative numbers. But for other
96:33 - values of r, as x goes to negative infinity,
x to the R is getting bigger and bigger and
96:40 - magnitude. And so one over x to the R is getting
smaller and smaller and magnitude and heading
96:45 - towards zero. Notice that this is no longer
true. if r is less than zero, for example,
96:53 - something like r equals negative two, because
one over x to the minus two is really x squared.
97:01 - And the limit as x goes to infinity of x squared
is going to be infinity, not zero.
97:12 - In this video, we looked at examples of limits
as x goes to infinity, and x goes to minus
97:18 - infinity. And we saw that those limits could
be zero. Any other number, infinity, negative
97:27 - infinity, or not exist. This video gives some
algebraic techniques for computing the limits
97:35 - at infinity of rational functions. Let's find
the limit as x goes to infinity of this rational
97:43 - function. The numerator and the denominator
of this rational function are each getting
97:49 - arbitrarily large as x goes to infinity. One
way to see this is by estimating the graphs,
97:56 - the graph of the numerator looks like a parabola
pointing upwards. And the graph of the denominator
98:02 - looks like some kind of cubic. So something
like this, for both of these graphs, as x
98:08 - goes to infinity, y also goes to infinity.
So this is an infinity over infinity indeterminate
98:15 - form. And just like the zero have over zero
indeterminate forms we saw earlier, and infinity
98:22 - over infinity and determinant form could turn
out to be absolutely anything. So we're going
98:28 - to use algebra to rewrite this expression
in a different form that makes it easier to
98:33 - evaluate. Specifically, we're going to factor
out the highest power of x that we can find
98:39 - from the numerator, and then from the denominator.
In the numerator, I'm going to factor out
98:45 - the highest power I see in the numerator,
which is x squared. When I factor x squared
98:51 - out of 5x squared, I get five, when I factor
x squared out of negative 4x, that's like
98:58 - dividing negative 4x by x squared, so I get
negative four divided by x. You can check
99:06 - this works by distributing the x squared and
making sure we get back to the original expression.
99:12 - Now the highest power of x SC, and the denominator
is x cubed. So I'll factor out an x cubed
99:19 - for each from each of those terms, I get a
two minus 11 over x plus 12 over x squared.
99:30 - Because factoring out an x cubed is the same
as dividing each term by x cubed and then
99:35 - writing the x cubed on the side. Now, we can
rewrite again by canceling an x squared from
99:40 - the top and the bottom to get the limit of
one over x times five minus four over x over
99:50 - two minus 11 over x plus 12 over x squared.
Now as x goes to infinity, four over x goes
100:00 - to zero, because I'm dividing for by larger
and larger numbers. Similarly 11 over x goes
100:06 - to zero, and 12 over x squared goes to zero.
So I end up with one over x, which is itself
100:13 - going to zero times something that's going
to five halves. So my limit is going to be
100:20 - zero times five halves, which is just zero.
I've actually been applying limit laws to
100:27 - do these last steps, which is fine, because
my component limits exist as finite numbers.
100:34 - Something that wasn't true from my original
expression when I had infinity over infinity.
100:40 - In this example, we're asked to find the limit
as x goes to negative infinity of a different
100:45 - rational expression. I encourage you to stop
the video and try it for yourself first. In
100:52 - this example, the highest power of x in the
numerator is x cubed, and the highest power
100:58 - in the denominator is also x cubed. Factoring
out the x cubed from the numerator, we get
101:06 - x cubed times three plus six over x plus 10
over x squared, plus two over x cubed. And
101:16 - factoring out the x cubed from the denominator,
we get x cubed times two, plus one over X
101:23 - plus five over x cubed. Now the x cubes cancel,
and all these parts go to zero. So when the
101:34 - dust clears here, our limit is just three
halves. In this next example, the highest
101:41 - power in the numerator is x to the fourth,
and the highest power in the denominator is
101:45 - x squared. So we factor out the x to the fourth
from the numerator and the x squared from
101:52 - the denominator and cancel as much as we can.
A lot of these pieces are going to zero.
102:02 - So our limit is the same as the limit of x
squared times one over negative five. As x
102:10 - goes to negative infinity, x squared is positive
and goes towards positive infinity. multiplying
102:16 - by negative fifth turns it negative, but doesn't
change the fact that the magnitudes are getting
102:22 - arbitrarily large. Therefore, our final limit
is negative infinity. Now let's look at the
102:31 - same three examples again, more informally,
using a heuristic to get the same conclusions.
102:37 - In the first example, the term 5x squared
dominates the numerator, because x squared
102:44 - is much larger than x when x is large. In
the denominator, the highest power of x to
102:52 - x cubed dominates, because x cubed is much
larger than x squared, or x when x is large.
103:00 - If we ignore all the other terms in the numerator
and denominator, and just focus on the important
103:06 - terms, which have the highest powers, then
we can rewrite our limit as the limit of 5x
103:14 - squared over 2x cubed, which is the same as
the limit as x goes to infinity of five over
103:22 - 2x, just by canceling Xs, which is zero as
x goes to infinity. Similarly, if we just
103:29 - focus on the highest power terms in the numerator
and denominator in the second example, we
103:35 - get the limit of 3x cubed over 2x cubed, which
simplifies to the limit of three halves, which
103:44 - is just three halves. In the third example,
the highest power terms are x to the fourth
103:51 - and negative 5x squared. And we rewrite the
limit using only these highest power terms
103:59 - and simplify, and we get the limit as x goes
to negative infinity of x squared over negative
104:05 - five, which is negative infinity as before,
for rational functions, in general, looking
104:13 - at the highest power terms, lets you reliably
predict the limits that infinity and negative
104:17 - infinity when the degree of the numerator
is less than the degree of the denominator,
104:23 - then the limit as x goes to infinity, or negative
infinity, is zero. As an example, one above,
104:32 - when the degree of the numerator is equal
to the degree of the denominator, then the
104:37 - limit is just the quotient of the highest
power terms, which is how we got three halves
104:43 - as the limit in the second example. And finally,
if the degree of the numerator is greater
104:49 - than the degree of the denominator, then the
limit is going to be plus or minus infinity.
104:55 - Like it was in the third example. These shortcut
rules are really handy. But it's important
105:01 - to also understand the technique of factoring
out highest power terms. Since this technique
105:07 - can be used more generally. This video gave
two methods for computing limits and infinity
105:14 - of rational functions. First, there's the
formal method of factoring out highest power
105:20 - terms and simplifying. Second, there's the
informal method of looking at the degree of
105:27 - the numerator and the degree of the denominator,
and focusing on the highest power terms. In
105:34 - the past, you may have heard an informal definition
of continuity. Something like a function is
105:40 - continuous, if you can draw it without ever
picking up your pencil. In this video, we'll
105:46 - develop a more precise definition of continuity
based on limits. It can be helpful to look
105:54 - at some examples of functions that are discontinuous,
that is functions that fail to be continuous.
106:00 - In order to better understand what it means
to be continuous. Please pause this video
106:05 - and try to draw graphs of at least two different
functions that fail to be continuous in different
106:10 - ways. One common kind of discontinuity is
called a jump discontinuity. A function has
106:18 - a jump discontinuity, if its graph separates
the two pieces with a jump in between them.
106:25 - This particular function can be described
as a piecewise defined function with two linear
106:31 - equations, f of x equals to x when x is less
than or equal to one, and f of x equals negative
106:39 - x plus two, when x is greater than one. Another
common kind of discontinuity is called a removable
106:48 - discontinuity.
106:51 - You may have encountered these before, when
you learned about rational functions with
106:55 - holes in them, for example, the function f
of x equals x minus three squared times x
107:03 - minus four divided by x minus four, which
has a hole when x equals four, and otherwise
107:10 - looks like the graph of x minus three squared.
This kind of discontinuity is called removable,
107:18 - because you could get rid of it by plugging
the hole just by defining F to have an appropriate
107:23 - value when x equals four. So in this case,
you'd want f of x to be the same when x is
107:30 - not equal to four, but you'd want it to have
the value of one when x equals four. And that
107:35 - would amount to plugging the hole and making
it continuous. In this original example, our
107:42 - function had a removable discontinuity because
it wasn't defined when x equals four. But
107:48 - a function could also have a removable discontinuity,
because it's defined in the wrong place at
107:53 - x equals four, for example, too high or too
low, to fit the trend of f. a discontinuity
108:02 - can also occur at a vertical asymptote, where
it's called an infinite discontinuity. For
108:08 - example, the rational function g of x is one
over x minus two has an infinite discontinuity
108:16 - at x equals two. Occasionally, you may encounter
a discontinuity is that don't look like any
108:23 - of these. For example, the graph of the function
y equals cosine of one over X has a wild discontinuity
108:34 - at x equals zero, because of the wild oscillating
behavior there. So for a function to be continuous
108:42 - at x equals a, we need it to avoid all of
these problems. To avoid a jump discontinuity,
108:50 - we can insist that the functions limit has
to exist at x equals a way to avoid a hole
108:57 - or removable discontinuity, we can insist
that F has to be defined at x equals A to
109:03 - avoid the other kind of removable discontinuity
in which f of a is defined, but it's in the
109:10 - wrong place. We can insist that the limit
of f of x as x goes to a has to equal f of
109:18 - a. Sometimes the definition of continuity
is written with just the third condition,
109:23 - and the first two conditions are implied.
Notice that these three conditions not only
109:29 - exclude jump this continuity and removal this
continuity is they also exclude infinite discontinuities
109:34 - and wild discontinuities. For example, in
our third example, the function can't be continuous
109:41 - at x equals two, because it fails to have
a limit at x equals two and it fails to have
109:46 - a value at x equals two. In our wild, this
continuity example, the limit also fails to
109:52 - exist at x equals zero, so the function can't
be continuous there. So what are the places
109:58 - where this function f is not in us and why,
please take a moment to think about it for
110:03 - yourself. The functions not continuous at
negative three, because the function is simply
110:11 - not defined there, the functions not continuous
at x equals one, because of that jump discontinuity.
110:18 - In the language of limits, we say that the
limit of f of x does not exist, when x equals
110:25 - two, the limit of the function exists and
equals three, but the value of the function
110:31 - is down here at negative one. So the function
is not continuous, because the limit doesn't
110:37 - equal the value at x equals three, the function
is not continuous, because once again, the
110:45 - limit doesn't exist. Notice that x equals
negative two. Even though the function turns
110:52 - a corner, the function still continuous. Because
the limit exists and equals two, and the value
110:59 - of the function is also two. The function
drawn here is not continuous at x equals negative
111:07 - two, because the limit doesn't exist at x
equals negative two, the limit from the left
111:13 - is one, while the limit from the right is
zero. But it is true that the value of the
111:20 - function at x equals negative two is equal
to the limit of the function from the left
111:27 - side. That is, f of negative two is equal
to the limit as x goes to negative two from
111:35 - the left of f of x.
111:39 - Notice that we can't say the same thing about
the right limit. The limit from the right
111:44 - is zero, while the value of the function is
one, and those are equal. In this situation,
111:50 - we say that f is continuous from the left,
but not from the right. By the same reasoning
111:57 - at x equals one, the function is not continuous,
but it is continuous from the right, because
112:04 - the limit from the right is equal to the value
of the function. Notice that f is not continuous
112:12 - from the left here, because the limit from
the left is about one and a half, while the
112:17 - value of the function is one. In general,
we say that a function f is continuous from
112:23 - the left at x equals j. If the limit as x
goes to a from the left of f of x is equal
112:31 - to f of a, and a function is continuous from
the right at x equals a. If the limit as x
112:38 - goes to a from the right of f of x equals
f of a, in practical terms of function is
112:46 - continuous from the left if the endpoint is
included on the left piece, and a function
112:52 - is continuous from the right, if the endpoint
is included on the right piece. This video
113:00 - gave a precise definition of continuity at
a point in terms of limits. Namely, a function
113:06 - is continuous at the point x equals a. If
the limit as x goes to a of the function is
113:15 - equal to the functions value
113:17 - at A.
113:18 - In a previous video, we gave a definition
for continuity at a point. In this video,
113:28 - we'll discuss continuity on an interval and
continuous functions. We say that a function
113:35 - f of x is continuous on the open interval
BC, if f of x is continuous at every point
113:40 - in that interval. For x to be continuous on
a closed interval BC, we require it to be
113:48 - continuous on every point in the interior
of BC, but we just require it to be continuous
113:54 - from the right at B. And from the left at
sea. We can also talk about f being continuous
114:00 - on half open intervals. For example, on half
open interval, BC, which is open at B and
114:07 - closed at sea, or the other way around, or
the happy to open it all from B to infinity
114:15 - and so on. In all of these cases, we require
F to be continuous on the interior of the
114:21 - interval, and left or right continuous on
the closed endpoints of the interval
114:25 - as appropriate.
114:27 - So on what intervals is this function geovax
continuous? Well, it's continuous. On this
114:35 - part, the arrows indicate it keeps on going.
So I'd say it's continuous from negative infinity
114:41 - to negative one, not including the endpoint
negative one. It's also continuous here, and
114:51 - we can include the endpoint this time. So
this is from negative one to one and Then
115:00 - again, on this last section, we can't include
one. It's not continuous there. It's not even
115:09 - defined there. So what kinds of functions
are continuous? What kinds of functions are
115:14 - continuous everywhere? And by everywhere,
I mean, on the entire real line negative infinity
115:20 - infinity? Well, polynomials are a great example.
Also, sine x and cosine x, the absolute value
115:31 - of x is another common example. There are
certainly many other functions that are continuous
115:38 - on the whole real line. I'll let you see if
you can come up with some more examples. Now,
115:43 - if we ask the second question, what kinds
of functions are continuous on their domains,
115:48 - we get a lot more answers, not only polynomials,
but also all rational functions, things like
115:55 - f of x equals 5x minus two over x minus three
squared times x plus four is a good example
116:03 - of a rational function, even though it's not
continuous everywhere. Because it's not continuous
116:08 - when x equals three or negative four, it is
continuous on its whole domain, because three
116:13 - and four are not in the domain of this rational
function. In addition, all trig functions,
116:19 - inverse trig functions, log and either the
x functions. And pretty much all the functions
116:25 - we normally encounter are continuous on their
domains, although their domains are not necessarily
116:29 - the whole real line. For example, for natural
log of x, the domain is just zero, infinity,
116:38 - and that's where the function is continuous.
In addition, the sums, differences, products
116:45 - and quotients of continuous functions are
continuous on their domains, so for example,
116:54 - y equals sine of x plus the natural log of
x is continuous where it's defined, the compositions
117:01 - of continuous functions are continuous on
their domains. So for example, the function
117:07 - y equals ln of sine of x is continuous, where
defined turns out to be a bunch of disjoint
117:15 - intervals where sine is positive. Since continuity
is defined in terms of limits, it's sometimes
117:24 - possible to use our knowledge of which functions
are continuous to calculate limits. For example,
117:30 - if we want to find the limit as x goes to
zero of cosine of x, because cosine is continuous,
117:37 - we can evaluate this limit just by plugging
in zero for x. And cosine of zero is one.
117:44 - We're using the definition of continuity here
to say that the limit of the function is equal
117:51 - to the value of the function. The second example
is a little trickier, because the function
117:56 - inside is not continuous at x equals two.
In fact, it's not defined at x equals two.
118:02 - But as X approaches 2x squared minus four
over 2x minus four times pi, can be rewritten
118:11 - as x plus two times x minus two over two times
x minus two times pi, which is the same thing
118:21 - as x plus two over two pi. For x not equal
to two. So as X approaches two, this expression
118:31 - here, approaches two plus two over two times
pi, which is just two pi. In other words,
118:43 - the limit as x goes to two of x squared minus
four over 2x minus four pi is just two pi.
118:52 - And therefore, the limit as x goes to two
of cosine of this expression is just cosine
119:02 - of two pi, which is again equal to one. We're
using here the fact that cosine is continuous,
119:10 - and a property of continuous functions, which
says that the limit as x goes to a of f of
119:16 - g of x is equal to f of the limit as x goes
to a of g of x. If f is a continuous function.
119:27 - In other words, for continuous functions,
you can pass the limit inside the function.
119:38 - That's all for continuity on intervals and
continuous functions. The intermediate value
119:46 - theorem says that if f is a continuous function,
on the closed interval a b and if n is any
119:55 - number, in between F of A and F of Bay, n
f has to achieve that value and somewhere.
120:03 - In other words, if n is a number between F
of A and F of b, then there has to be a number
120:11 - c in the interval a, b, such that f of c equals
n. In our example, there are three such possible
120:24 - values for C, it could be right here, since
f of that number equals n, or it could be
120:32 - here, or here, I'll just mark the middle one.
The intermediate value theorem can only be
120:40 - applied to continuous functions. If the function
is not continuous, then it might jump over
120:49 - and, and never achieve that value. When application
of the intermediate value theorem is to prove
120:56 - the existence of roots or zeros of equations,
we call that a real root of p of x is a real
121:03 - number c,
121:07 - such that P of C is zero, we're going to want
to apply the intermediate value theorem
121:18 - with n equal to zero. Our polynomial is defined
on the whole real line, not just an interval.
121:27 - But the trick here is to pick an interval
a b, so that P of A is negative, and P of
121:33 - B is positive, or vice versa. So that the
intermediate value theorem will tell us that
121:38 - P has to pass through zero in between. I'm
just going to use trial and error here and
121:45 - calculate a few values of p. So P of zero
is easy to calculate, P of zero is just seven.
121:52 - P of one is going to be five minus three minus
12 plus seven, which equals negative three.
122:02 - So in this very lucky example, the first two
numbers that we pick will work for our A and
122:08 - B, so we can just let A be equal 01. Because
P of zero is a positive number, and P of one
122:19 - is a negative number. So actually, the graph
should look a little different. The graph
122:26 - looks more like this. But in any case, by
the intermediate value theorem, there has
122:32 - to be a number c, in between, in this case,
zero and one, where our polynomial p achieves
122:40 - this intermediate value of zero. And that
number See, we don't know what it is, but
122:46 - we know it somewhere in the interval zero
to one, that value c gives us a real root
122:51 - for our polynomial. There may be other real
roots, but we've proved there exists at least
122:55 - one. The intermediate value theorem has lots
of other applications besides finding roots.
123:03 - For example, suppose you have a wall that
runs in a circle around the castle, and the
123:09 - height of the wall varies continuously as
a function of the angle. Surprisingly, the
123:16 - intermediate value theorem can be used to
show there must be somewhere two diametrically
123:21 - opposite places on the wall with exactly the
same height. So if you can figure out a way
123:26 - to show this in this video, we stated the
intermediate value theorem, which holds for
123:33 - continuous functions, and talked about a couple
of applications. This video introduces the
123:38 - trig functions, sine, cosine, tangent, secant,
cosecant, and cotangent. For right triangles.
123:52 - For a right triangle with sides of length
A, B and C angle theta as drawn, we define
124:03 - sine of theta as the length of the opposite
side over the hypothesis. The side that's
124:13 - opposite to our angle theta has measure a
and I have partners is this side here with
124:19 - measure C. So that would be a oversee for
this triangle. Cosine of theta is defined
124:28 - as the length of the adjacent side over the
length of high partners. This side here is
124:35 - the side adjacent to theta. Of course, the
high partners is also adjacent to theta, but
124:39 - it's special as the high partners so we don't
think of it as the adjacent side. So that
124:44 - would be B oversea. tangent of theta is the
opposite side length over the adjacent side
124:52 - length. So that would be a over b. The pneumonic
to remember this is so A toa. That's sine
125:04 - is opposite over hypotenuse. Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse. And tangent is opposite over
125:16 - adjacent. In fact, there's a relationship
between tangent and sine and cosine. Namely,
125:24 - tangent of theta is equal to sine of theta
over cosine of theta. If you want to see why
125:33 - that's, that's because sine of theta over
cosine of theta is given by sine, which is
125:39 - opposite over hypotenuse, divided by cosine,
which is adjacent over hypotenuse. If we compute
125:49 - these fractions by flipping and multiplying,
125:54 - the high partners, length cancels, and we
just get opposite over adjacent, which is
126:01 - by definition, tangent of theta. There are
three more trig functions that are defined
126:07 - in terms of sine, cosine and tangent. First
of all, their sequence of theta, by definition,
126:14 - that's one over cosine of theta. So it's going
to be one over the adjacent over hypotenuse,
126:22 - which is the high partners over the adjacent,
which in this triangle is C over B. cosecant
126:30 - of theta is defined as one over sine theta.
So that's one over the opposite over the hypotenuse,
126:39 - which is the high partners over the opposite.
And for this triangle, that's going to be
126:44 - C over a. Finally, cotangent of theta is defined
as one over tan theta, that's going to be
126:52 - one over opposite over adjacent, flip and
multiply, I get adjacent over opposite birth,
127:01 - which in this case is b over a. So notice
that the values for cotangent cosecant and
127:10 - secant are the reciprocals of the values for
tangent, sine and cosine, respectively. Let's
127:20 - use these definitions to find the exact values
of all six trig functions for the angle theta
127:26 - in this triangle. I'll start with sine of
theta. That's the opposite of our hypothesis.
127:34 - Well, for this angle theta, the opposite side
is down here, and as measured to the high
127:41 - partners has measured five. So sine theta
is two over five. Cosine theta is adjacent
127:49 - over hypotenuse, but I don't know the value
of this side length. But fortunately, I can
127:56 - find it using the Fagor in theorem says I
have a right triangle here, I know that a
128:00 - squared, I'll call this side length A plus
B squared, where b is this other leg of the
128:09 - triangle is equal to c squared, where c is
the hypothesis. So here I have a squared plus
128:15 - two squared equals five squared, which means
that a squared plus four equals 25. A squared
128:22 - is 21. So A is plus or minus the square root
of 21. But since I'm talking about the length
128:28 - of a side of a triangle, I can just use the
positive answer. Returning to my computation
128:33 - of cosine theta, I can write it as adjacent,
which is the square root of 21. Over hypotony
128:42 - News, which is five, tangent theta is the
opposite over the adjacent, so that's going
128:49 - to be two over the square root of 21. To compute
secant of theta, that's one over cosine theta,
129:00 - so that's going to be one over square root
of 21 over five, which is five over the square
129:06 - root of 21. The reciprocal of my cosine value.
cosecant theta is one over sine theta, that's
129:17 - going to be the reciprocal of my sine, so
five halves, and cotangent theta is one over
129:23 - a tan theta, so it's going to be the reciprocal
of my 10 value square root of 21 over two.
129:29 - Finally, we'll do an application. So if we
have a kite that's flying at an angle of elevation
129:38 - as the angle from the horizontal bar of 75
degrees with a kite length string of 100 meters,
129:47 - we want to find out how high it is. I'll call
the height Why? Well, we want to relate the
129:55 - known quantities this angle and this hypothesis
to The unknown quantity, the unknown quantity
130:02 - is the opposite side of our triangle. So if
we use sine of theta equals opposite of our
130:10 - hypothesis, then we can relate these known
amounts sine of 75 degrees to our unknown
130:18 - amount y, which is the opposite and are known
amount of 100 meters. solving for y, this
130:25 - gives that y is 100 meters times sine of 75
degrees, we can use a calculator to compute
130:32 - sine of 75 degrees, be sure you use degree
mode and not radian mode, when you type in
130:39 - the 75. When I do the computation, I get a
final answer of 96.59 meters up to two decimal
130:50 - places. Notice that we're ignoring the height
of the person in this problem.
130:55 - To remember the definitions of the trig functions,
you can use the pneumonic, so tau, and the
131:03 - fact that secant is the reciprocal of cosine
cosecant the reciprocal of sine and cotangent
131:08 - the reciprocal of tangent. In this video,
I'll use geometry to compute the sine and
131:16 - cosine of a 30 degree angle, a 45 degree angle
and a 60 degree angle. One way to compute
131:24 - the sine of a 45 degree angle is to use a
right triangle with a 45 degree angle. This
131:31 - particular right triangle has I have partners
of length one. Since all the angles of the
131:38 - triangle have to add up to 180 degrees, and
we already have 90 degrees and 45 degrees,
131:46 - the remaining angle must also be 45 degrees.
So we have an isosceles triangle with two
131:51 - sides the same length, I'll call that side
length a. If we want sine of 45 degrees, let's
131:58 - use this 45 degree angle here, then sine is
opposite over hypotenuse. So if I can figure
132:04 - out how long this side length is, I'll be
able to compute sine of 45 degrees. Now the
132:10 - Pythagorean theorem says this side length
squared plus that side land squared equals
132:14 - I have hotness squared. So we have that a
squared plus a squared equals one squared.
132:21 - All right, that is two A squared equals one.
So a squared is one half, and a is plus or
132:28 - minus the square root of one half. Since we're
talking about the length of sides of triangles,
132:34 - I can just use the positive square root it's
customary to rewrite this as the square root
132:41 - of one over the square root of two, which
is one over the square root of two, and then
132:46 - rationalize the denominator by multiplying
the top and the bottom by the square root
132:50 - of two. That gives me a square root of two
in the numerator, and the square root of two
132:54 - squared in the denominator, which is the square
root of two over two. So the side lengths
133:00 - are the square root of two over two. Now I
can figure out the sine of 45 degrees, by
133:08 - computing the opposite over the hypotenuse.
That's, I'm looking at this angle. So opposite
133:14 - is square root of two over two hypothesis
one. So the sine of 45 degrees is the square
133:23 - root of two over two. Cosine of 45 degrees
is adjacent over hypotenuse. That's this side
133:30 - length over this hypothesis. So that's the
square root of two over two over one again,
133:38 - what would happen if instead of using this
triangle with hypotony is one, we use this
133:43 - triangle, also a 4545 90 triangle with hypotony
is five, not quite drawn to scale. Please
133:51 - pause the video for a moment and repeat the
computation with this triangle. This time,
133:57 - I'll call the side length B. Pythagoras theorem
tells me b squared plus b squared equals five
134:03 - squared. So two, b squared equals 25. And
b squared equals 25 over two, B is going to
134:11 - be the plus or minus the square root of 25
over two again, I can just use the positive
134:17 - version. And so B is the square root of 25
over the square root of two, which is five
134:23 - over the square root of two, rationalizing
the denominator, I get five root two over
134:29 - two. Now, sine of my 45 degree angle is opposite
overhype hotness,
134:40 - which is
134:41 - five square root of two over two divided by
five. That simplifies to the square root of
134:46 - two over two as before, and a similar computation
shows that cosine of 45 degrees is also square
134:54 - root of two over two as before. This makes
sense because sine and cosine are based on
135:00 - ratios of sides. And since these two triangles
are similar triangles, they'll have the same
135:06 - ratios of sides. To find the sine and cosine
of 30 degrees, let's use this 30 6090 right
135:14 - triangle with hypotony is one. If we double
the triangle, we get an angle of 30 here,
135:24 - so a total angle of 60 degrees here, and this
angle is also 60 degrees. So we have a 60
135:31 - 6060 triangle, that's an equilateral triangle,
all side lengths are the same. Since this
135:37 - side length has length one, this side length
is also one. This entire side length is one,
135:45 - which means this short side of our original
triangle has length one half. Going back to
135:52 - my original triangle, let's use the Pythagorean
Theorem to find the length of its longer side
135:59 - x. But agrin theorem says x squared plus one
half squared equals one squared. So x squared
136:08 - plus a fourth equals 1x squared is three fourths.
And so x is plus or minus the square root
136:15 - of three fourths is the positive version,
and get the square root of three over the
136:21 - square root of four, which is the square root
of three over two. Now using our original
136:27 - triangle, again, let's compute the sine of
this 30 degree angle here. We know that sine
136:35 - of 30 degrees is opposite of our hypothesis,
the opposite of this angle is one half and
136:43 - the hypothesis is one. So we get a sine of
one half over one, which is one half cosine
136:51 - of 30 degrees is adjacent over hypothesis.
So that's the square root of three over two
136:58 - divided by one. To find sine of 60 degrees
and cosine of 60 degrees, we can actually
137:04 - use this same green triangle and just focus
on this upper corner angle of 60 degrees instead.
137:13 - So sine of 60 degrees. Opposite overhype hotness,
but this time the opposite to this angle is
137:22 - the square root of three over two. Cosine
of 60 degrees adjacent over hypotenuse gives
137:32 - us one half. I'll summarize the results in
this table below. Notice that a 30 degree
137:39 - angle corresponds to pi over six radians since
30 degrees times pi over 180 is pi over six.
137:51 - Similarly, 45 degrees corresponds to pi over
four radians and 60 degrees corresponds to
137:57 - pi over three radians. I recommend that you
memorize the three numbers one half, root
138:04 - two over two, and root three over two. And
the fact that one half and root three over
138:10 - two go together. And root two over two goes
with itself. From that information, it's not
138:20 - hard to reconstruct the triangles, you know
that a 4545 90 triangle is my sauciest triangle.
138:28 - So it must have the side lengths were the
same number goes with itself. And a 30 6090
138:35 - triangle has one side length smaller than
the other. So the smaller side must be one
138:42 - half and the larger side must be root three
over two since root three is bigger than one
138:47 - and so root three over two is bigger than
one half. Doing a visual check, you can easily
138:54 - fill in the angles, the smaller angle must
be the 30 degree angle, and the larger one
139:01 - must be the 60 degree one. In this video,
we computed the sine and cosine of three special
139:07 - angles 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees.
This video defined sine and cosine in terms
139:19 - of points on the unit circle. a unit circle
is a circle with radius one.
139:26 - Up to now we defined sine and cosine and tangent
in terms of right triangles. For example,
139:32 - to find sine of 14 degrees in theory, you
could draw a right triangle with an angle
139:39 - of 14 degrees and then calculate the sign
as the length of the opposite side over the
139:49 - length of pi partners. But if we use this
method to try to compute sine of 120 degrees,
139:56 - things go horribly wrong. When we draw this
120 degree angle, and this right angle, there's
140:04 - no way to complete this picture to get a right
triangle. So instead, we're going to use a
140:10 - unit circle, that is a circle of radius one.
The figure below illustrates how right triangles
140:17 - and a unit circle are related. If you draw
right triangles, with larger of hypotenuse
140:23 - one with larger and larger angles, then the
top vertex sweeps out part of a unit circle.
140:32 - Let's look at this relationship in more detail.
In this figure, I've drawn a right triangle
140:39 - inside a unit circle, the high partners of
the triangle is the radius of the circle,
140:45 - which is one, one vertex of the right triangle
is at the origin, another vertex of the right
140:53 - triangle is at the edge of the circle, I'm
going to call the coordinates of that vertex
140:58 - A, B. Now the base of this right triangle
has length a, the x coordinate, and the height
141:09 - of the right triangle is B, the y coordinate.
If I use the right triangle definition of
141:17 - sine and cosine of theta, this right here
is the angle theta, then cosine of theta is
141:25 - adjacent over hypotenuse, so that's a over
one, or a. Notice that a also represents the
141:35 - x coordinate of this point on the unit circle.
At angle theta from the x axis. I'll write
141:43 - that down. For sine of theta, if I use the
right triangle definition, that's opposite
141:49 - overhead partners, so B over one, which is
just B. But B also represents the y coordinate
142:00 - of this point in the on the unit circle at
angle theta. For tangent theta, if we use
142:07 - the right side triangle definition, its opposite
over adjacent. So that's B over A, I can think
142:14 - of that as the y coordinate of the point over
the x coordinate of the point. Now for angles
142:21 - theta, that can't be part of a right triangle,
because they're too big, they're bigger than
142:25 - 90 degrees, like now I'll call this angle
here theta, I can still use this idea of x
142:33 - and y coordinates to calculate the sine and
cosine of theta. So if I just mark this point,
142:41 - on the end of this line at angle theta, if
I mark that to have coordinates x and y, then
142:49 - cosine theta, I'm still going to define as
the x coordinate of this point, sine theta
142:56 - as the y coordinate, and tangent theta as
the ratio of the y coordinate over the x coordinate.
143:06 - When we use this unit circle definition, we
always draw theta starting from the positive
143:12 - x axis and going counterclockwise. Let's use
this unit circle definition to calculate sine,
143:23 - cosine and tangent of this angle fee. In our
figure, we have a unit circle. And these numbers
143:31 - are supposed to represent the x&y coordinates
of this point on the unit circle at the endpoint
143:39 - of this line segment, that lies at angle fee
for the positive x axis. Sign fee is equal
143:49 - to the y coordinate cosine fee is equal to
the x coordinate. And tangent of fee is given
143:59 - by the ratio of the two, which works out to
negative 0.3639 up to four decimal places.
144:09 - This video gives a method for calculating
sine cosine and tangent in terms of the unit
144:14 - circle. Starting from the positive x axis,
you draw the angle theta going counterclockwise.
144:26 - You look at the coordinates of the point on
the circle where that angle ends. And the
144:34 - cosine of that angle theta is the x coordinate,
sine of theta is the y coordinate, and tangent
144:43 - of theta is the ratio. This video gives three
properties of the trig function sine and cosine
144:51 - that can be deduced from the unit circle definition.
Recall that the unit circle definition of
144:57 - sine and cosine for angle theta is that cosine
theta is the x coordinate. And sine of theta
145:08 - is the y coordinate for the point on the unit
circle at angle theta. The first property
145:17 - is what I call the periodic property. This
says that the values of cosine and sine are
145:23 - periodic with period two pi. And what that
means is that if you take cosine of an angle
145:29 - plus two pi, you get the same thing as just
if you took cosine of the angle. So when we
145:36 - write this down, we're assuming that theta
is measured in radians. If we want to measure
145:43 - theta in degrees, the similar statement is
that cosine of theta plus 360 degrees is equal
145:50 - to cosine of theta, we can make the same statements
for sine, sine of an angle plus two pi is
145:58 - equal to sine of the original angle, here,
the angle being measured in radians. If we
146:05 - want to measure the angle in degrees, the
statement is that sine of theta plus 360 is
146:11 - equal to sine of theta, we can see why this
is true from the unit circle definition of
146:18 - sine and cosine. This is our angle theta,
then theta plus two pi, the plus two pi adds
146:28 - a full turn around the unit circle to our
angle, so we end up at the same place, theta
146:34 - and theta plus two pi are just two different
names for the same location on the unit circle.
146:40 - And since sine and cosine give you the y and
x coordinates of that point on the unit circle,
146:46 - they have to have the same value. Similarly,
if we consider an angle theta, and an angle
146:53 - theta minus two pi, the minus two pi means
we go the other direction around the unit
147:00 - circle clockwise, we still end up in the same
place. And therefore, cosine of theta minus
147:07 - two pi, the x coordinate of that position
is the same thing as cosine of theta, sine
147:13 - of theta minus two pi is the same thing as
sine of theta, the same statements hold if
147:19 - we add or subtract multiples of two pi. For
example, cosine of theta plus four pi is still
147:25 - the same thing as cosine of theta. This time,
we've just gone to turns around the unit circle
147:28 - and still gotten back to the same place. So
if we want to find cosine of five Pi, that's
147:39 - the same thing as cosine of pi plus four pi,
which is the same thing as cosine of pi. Thinking
147:47 - about the unit circle, pi is halfway around
the unit circle. So cosine of pi means the
147:55 - x coordinate of this point right here. Well,
that point has coordinates negative one, zero,
148:00 - so cosine of pi must be negative one. If I
want to take sine of negative 420 degrees,
148:08 - well, that's sine of negative 360 degrees,
minus 60 degrees, which is the same thing
148:17 - as sine of minus 60 degrees. Thinking about
the unit circle, minus 60 degrees, means I
148:25 - start at the positive x axis and go clockwise
by 60 degrees that lands me about right here.
148:33 - And so that's one of the special angles that
has an x coordinate of one half a y coordinate
148:40 - of negative root three over two. And therefore
sine of negative 60 is negative root three
148:47 - over two the y coordinate. The next property
I call the even odd property, it says that
148:53 - cosine is an even function, which means that
cosine of negative theta is the same thing
149:00 - as cosine of theta, while sine is an odd function,
which means that sine of negative theta is
149:08 - the negative of sine of theta. To see why
this is true, let's look at an angle theta.
149:15 - And the angle negative theta. A negative angle
means you go in the clockwise instead of counterclockwise
149:23 - direction from the positive x axis.
149:27 - The coordinates of this point by definition,
r cosine theta sine theta, whereas the coordinates
149:34 - of this point are cosine negative theta, sine
of negative theta. But by symmetry, these
149:44 - two points have the exact same x coordinate,
and therefore cosine of theta must equal cosine
149:51 - of negative theta, while their y coordinates
have the same magnitude, but opposite signs.
149:57 - This one's positive and this one's negative.
Have, therefore, sine of negative theta is
150:04 - the negative of sine of theta. Let's figure
out if tan of theta isn't even or odd function.
150:12 - Well, we know that tan of negative theta,
tangent by definition, is sine over cosine.
150:21 - Well, we know that sine of negative theta
is the negative of sine of theta, whereas
150:29 - cosine of negative theta is cosine of theta.
Therefore, we're getting negative sign theta
150:38 - over cosine theta, which is negative tan of
theta. Since tan of negative theta is the
150:46 - negative of tan of theta, tan theta is an
odd function. The last property on this video
150:56 - is the Pythagorean property, which says that
cosine of theta squared plus sine of theta
151:02 - squared is equal to one. A lot of times this
property is written with this shorthand notation,
151:09 - cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta
equals one. But this notation, cosine squared
151:18 - theta just means you take cosine of theta
and square it. This property is called the
151:25 - Pythagorean property, because it comes from
the Pythagorean Theorem. Let me draw a right
151:31 - triangle on the unit circle. I'll call this
angle theta. So the coordinates of this endpoint
151:38 - here are cosine theta sine theta. Since this
is supposed to be a unit circle, the hypotenuse
151:46 - of my right triangle has length one, the base
of my right triangle is just cosine theta,
151:53 - same thing as the x coordinate of this point.
And the height of my triangle is the y coordinate
151:59 - of the point sine theta. Now the Pythagorean
theorem says that this side length squared
152:07 - plus that so that squared equals one squared,
since one squared is the same thing as one,
152:15 - that gives me the Pythagorean property. But
tigrayan property is handy for computing values
152:20 - of cosine given values of sine and vice versa.
And this problem, we're told that sine of
152:26 - t is negative two sevenths. And T is an angle
that lies in quadrant three. When we say the
152:33 - angle lies in quadrant three, that means the
terminal side of the angle lies here in quadrant
152:41 - three. One way to find cosine of t is to use
the fact that cosine squared t plus sine squared
152:48 - t is equal to one. That is cosine of t squared
plus negative 2/7 squared is equal to one,
153:02 - I can write this as cosine of t squared plus
4/49 is equal to one and so cosine of t squared
153:12 - is equal to one minus 4/49, which is 4540
nights. taking the square root of both sides,
153:21 - that goes for the cosine t is plus or minus
the square root of 45 over 49, that's plus
153:29 - or minus the square root of 45 over seven.
Now since we're in the third quadrant, we
153:35 - know that cosine of t, which represents the
x coordinate of this point, must also be negative.
153:42 - Therefore, cosine of t is going to be negative
square to 45 over seven. It's also possible
153:51 - to solve this problem using the Pythagorean
theorem for right triangles directly. If we
153:57 - look at the fact that sine of t is negative
two sevenths and ignore the negative sign
154:02 - for now, we can think of this information
as telling us that we have a right triangle
154:08 - angle theta, whose opposite side is two, and
whose high partners is seven.
154:14 - We call this side here a them but Tiger in
theorem says us a squared plus two squared
154:21 - is seven squared. So a squared plus four is
49. So a squared is 45. And a is plus or minus
154:31 - the square root of 45. Since I'm worrying
about a triangle, I'm going to use the positive
154:37 - value. Now, cosine of t is going to be adjacent
over hypotenuse. So that's going to be the
154:48 - square root of 45 over seven. Now I go back
to thinking about positive and negative signs.
154:54 - And I noticed that since I'm in the third
quadrant, my co sign is be negative, so I
155:01 - just stick a negative sign in front. This
alternative solution, this is many of the
155:07 - same ideas as the previous solution, and ultimately
gets us the same answer. This video gives
155:14 - three properties of trig functions, the periodic
property, the even odd property, and the Pythagorean
155:22 - property. This video is about the graphs of
sine and cosine. I want to graph the functions
155:30 - y equals cosine t and y equals sine t, where
t is in radians, I'm gonna think of this being
155:36 - the t axis, and this being the y axis. One
way to do this is to plot points. So I'll
155:43 - fill in this chart, using my knowledge of
special angles on the unit circle. These points
155:50 - will be easier to graph, if I convert them
all to decimals. Now plot the points for cosine
155:57 - and connect the dots to get a graph of y equals
cosine t from t equals zero to t equals two
156:04 - pi. To continue the graph for t values less
than zero or bigger than two pi, I could plot
156:10 - more points. Or I could just use the fact
that the cosine values repeat. If I add or
156:17 - subtract two pi to the my angle T, I'll be
at the same place on the unit circle. So my
156:24 - cosine will be exactly the same. Therefore,
my values of cosine, which are represented
156:29 - by my y values on this graph, repeat themselves.
For example, when my T value is two pi plus
156:37 - pi over six about like here, it's cosine is
the same as the cosine of just pi over six.
156:43 - So I'll take this dot here and repeat it over
here. Similarly, the when t is like two pi
156:51 - plus pi over four, I get the same value of
cosine is when it's just pi over four. So
156:56 - this.is going to repeat. And I can continue
repeating all my dots. This one repeats over
157:02 - here at two pi plus, say pi over three. And
so my whole graph will repeat something like
157:11 - this. It also repeats on this side, something
like this. Since subtracting two pi from my
157:21 - t values will also give me the same value
of cosine. We can also plot points to get
157:27 - a graph for sine and extend it by repetition.
Going forward, I'll usually write the function
157:35 - sine and cosine as y equals cosine of x and
y equals sine of x. When I read it this way,
157:44 - notice that x now refers to an angle, while
y refers to a value of cosine, or sine. That's
157:53 - a different meaning of x and y, compared to
when we're talking about the unit circle,
157:58 - where x refers to the cosine value, and y
refers to the sine value. Now let's look at
158:03 - some properties of the graphs of sine and
cosine. The first thing you might notice is
158:09 - that the graph of cosine and the graph of
sine are super similar to each other. In fact,
158:14 - you can think of the graph of cosine as just
being the graph of sine shifted to the left
158:20 - by pi over two. So we can write cosine of
x as the sine function of x plus pi over two,
158:31 - since adding pi over two on the inside, move
the graph horizontally to the left by pi over
158:39 - two. Or we can think of the graph of sine
as being constructed from the graph of cosine
158:45 - by shifting the cosine graph right by pi over
two, that means we can write sine of x as
158:51 - equal to cosine of x minus pi over two, since
subtracting pi over two on the inside, shifts
158:58 - the cosine graph to the right by pi over two.
159:02 - Next, let's look at domain and range. The
domain of sine and cosine is all real numbers.
159:08 - All right, that is negative infinity to infinity,
but the range is just from negative one to
159:14 - one. That makes sense, because sine and cosine
come from the unit circle. The input values
159:21 - for the domain come from angles. And you can
use any numbers and angle positive or negative
159:26 - as big as you want, just by wrapping a lot
of times around the circle. The output values
159:31 - for the range, that is the actual values of
sine and cosine come from the coordinates
159:36 - on the unit circle. And those coordinates
can't be any bigger than one or any smaller
159:40 - than negative one. So that gives us a range.
As far as even an odd behavior, you can tell
159:46 - from the graph. Here's cosine, that it's symmetric
with respect to the y axis and so it must
159:51 - be even. Whereas the graph of sine is symmetric
with respect to the origin and must be odd.
159:58 - The absolute maximum value have these two
functions is one and the absolute minimum
160:04 - value is negative one. We can also use the
words midline amplitude and period to describe
160:12 - these two functions. The midline is the horizontal
line, halfway in between the maximum and minimum
160:20 - points. Here, the midline is y equals zero,
the amplitude is the vertical distance between
160:29 - a maximum point and the midline. You can also
think of the amplitude as the vertical distance
160:35 - between a minimum point and the midline, or
as half the vertical distance between a midpoint
160:41 - and a max point. For the cosine function and
the sine function, the amplitude is one. A
160:48 - periodic function is a function that repeats
at regular horizontal intervals. The horizontal
160:53 - length of the smallest repeating unit is called
the period for Y equals cosine of x, the period
161:02 - is two pi. Notice that the period is the horizontal
distance between successive peaks, or maximum
161:10 - points, or between successive troughs, or
minimum points. algebraically, we can write
161:18 - cosine of x plus two pi equals cosine of x
and sine of x plus two pi equals sine of x
161:28 - to indicate that the functions repeat themselves
over an interval of two pi and have a period
161:33 - of two pi. In this video, we graphed y equals
cosine of x and y equals sine of x. and observe
161:45 - that they both have a midline at y equals
zero, an amplitude of one and a period of
161:54 - two pi. sine u sort of functions are functions
that are related to sine and cosine by transformations
162:03 - like stretching and shrinking and shifting.
This video is about graphing these functions.
162:10 - Let's start by graphing the function, y equals
three sine of 2x. This function is related
162:17 - to the function y equals sine x. So I'll graph
that first. Now, the three on the outside
162:24 - stretches this graph vertically by a factor
of three, while the two on the inside compresses
162:32 - that horizontally by a factor of one half.
If instead I want to graph y equals three
162:39 - sine 2x plus one, this plus one on the outside
shifts everything up by one unit. Let's compare
162:48 - the midline amplitude and period of our original
y equals sine x are transformed y equals three
163:00 - sine 2x. And our further transformed y equals
three sine 2x plus one, the original sine
163:07 - has a midline at y equals zero, an amplitude
of one and a period of two pi. For the transformed
163:16 - function, y equals three times sine of 2x.
The two on the inside shrinks everything horizontally
163:23 - by a factor of one half. So it changes the
period of two pi into a period of one half
163:33 - times two pi,
163:36 - which is pi.
163:38 - Since the two on the inside only affects x
values and horizontal distances, it doesn't
163:44 - affect the midline, which is a y value, or
the amplitude, which is a vertical distance.
163:50 - But the three on the outside does affect these
things. Well, in particular, it affects the
163:54 - amplitude, since everything is stretched out
vertically by a factor of three, the amplitude
164:00 - of one get stretch to an amplitude of three.
In this case, the midline doesn't actually
164:08 - change, because multiplying a y value of zero
by three is still a y value of zero. Now on
164:17 - the third function, we've taken the second
function and added one on the outside, so
164:22 - that shifts everything up by one. Therefore,
instead of having a midline at y equals zero,
164:26 - we now have a midline at y equals one. The
amplitude doesn't change though it's still
164:33 - three because shifting everything up by one
doesn't affect the distance between the mid
164:38 - mind and the end the maximum point. Also,
the period is still pi since the period is
164:43 - a horizontal measure, and adding one on the
outside only affects vertical things. Now
164:49 - next, let's graph the function y equals three
times sine of two times quantity x minus pi
164:55 - over four. This function is very closely related
to the First function we graphed on the previous
165:01 - page, that was y equals three sine of 2x.
In fact, if we give the name f of x to that
165:11 - function, and maybe we can call g of x, this
other function, then we can get g of x by
165:20 - taking f of x and plugging in x minus pi over
four in for x. In other words, g of x is f
165:29 - of x minus pi over four. This relationship
gives me an idea for graphing g of x, the
165:37 - function we want to graph, we can first graph
f of x, we already did that on the previous
165:43 - page. And then we can shift its graph to the
right by pi over four, because that's what
165:52 - you do when you subtract a number on the inside
of a function. So here's the graph of y equals
166:00 - three sine 2x. Recall that it's just the graph
of sine stretched vertically by a factor of
166:07 - three, and shrunk horizontally by a factor
of one half. Now, to graph the function that
166:13 - I want, I'm going to shift this graph over
by pi over four to the right. Notice that
166:19 - since I had my function written in factored
form, I could just read off the horizontal
166:25 - shift. But if I had written it instead, as
y equals three sine 2x minus pi over two,
166:37 - which is algebraically equivalent, it would
be easy to get confused and think that I needed
166:42 - to shift over by pi over two. So it's best
to factor first, before figuring out what
166:49 - the shift is, we're factoring out the coefficient
of x. If instead, we wanted to graph this
166:56 - function, same as the one we just graphed,
it's just with a minus one on the outside,
167:00 - that minus one would just bring everything
down by one. Let's take a moment to look at
167:06 - midline amplitude, and period for the original
parent function, y equals sine of x, and our
167:17 - final transformed function, y equals three
sine of two times quantity x minus pi over
167:24 - four minus one, our original sine function
has midline at y equals zero amplitude of
167:31 - one and period of two pi. For our transform
function, the three on the outside stretches
167:39 - vertically, so it makes the amplitude three.
The minus one on the outside shifts everything
167:49 - down by one. So it brings the midline, y equals
zero, down to Y equals negative one, the two
167:59 - on the inside, shrinks everything horizontally
by a factor of one half. So the period becomes
168:07 - one half times two pi, which is pi. Finally,
there's a horizontal shift going on our transformed
168:19 - function shifts to the right, by pi over four,
this horizontal shift is sometimes called
168:27 - the phase shift. The function we just analyzed
was y equals three sine 2x minus pi over four
168:40 - minus one, which could also be written as
y equals three sine 2x minus pi over two minus
168:48 - one. This is a function of the form y equals
a sine B x minus c plus d, where b is positive.
168:59 - If we have a function of this form, or the
similar function with cosine in it, then we
169:04 - know that the midline is going to be at y
equals D. That's because the original midline
169:12 - of sine or cosine at y equals zero gets shifted
up by D, we know that the amplitude is going
169:21 - to be a because this A multiplied on the outside
stretches everything vertically by a factor
169:28 - of A.
169:30 - to be a little more accurate, we should say
the amplitude is the absolute value of A in
169:34 - case a is negative. If a is negative, then
that amounts to a vertical reflection or a
169:40 - reflection over the x axis. We know that the
period of the original sine or cosine is two
169:48 - pi. And we know that this factor of B amounts
to a horizontal shrink by a factor of one
169:56 - over B or I guess it could be a horizontal
stretch by a factor of one over b If b is
170:01 - less than one, so because we're starting with
a period of two pi, and we're multiplying
170:09 - by one over B, our new period is going to
be two Pi over B. The trickiest thing is the
170:18 - horizontal shift. And to get that right, I
like to factor out this B for my equation.
170:25 - So instead of writing y equals a cosine bx
minus c plus d, I'm going to write y equals
170:33 - A cosine B times quantity x minus c over b
plus d. Similarly, if it's a sine function,
170:41 - I write y equals a sine B times x minus quantity
c over b plus d, then I can read off the horizontal
170:49 - shift as C over B. And that'll be a shift
to the right, if C over B is positive and
170:57 - a shift to the left, if C over b is negative,
this might seem backwards from what you're
171:01 - used to, but it's because we have that minus
sign there. So if C over B is positive, we're
171:05 - actually subtracting on the inside. So that
shifts right, if C of b over b is negative
171:10 - minus a negative is actually adding something,
and that's why it shifts it to the left. So
171:15 - as one final example, say I wanted to graph
y equals 1/3, cosine of one half x plus three
171:26 - minus five, that would have a midline at y
equals minus five, an amplitude of 1/3, a
171:40 - period of two pi divided by one half, which
is four pi, and a horizontal shift. Better
171:51 - rewrite this horizontal shift of six units
to the left, the horizontal shift is sometimes
172:02 - called the phase shift. And that's all for
graphs of sinusoidal functions. This video
172:11 - is about graphing the trig functions, tangent,
secant, cotangent and cosecant. To gain an
172:18 - intuition for the graph of y equals tangent
of x, I think it's handy to look at the slope
172:25 - of a line at angle theta on the unit circle.
The slope of this line is the rise over the
172:34 - run. But the rise is given by sine of theta,
and the run is given by cosine of theta. So
172:44 - the slope is given by sine theta over cosine
theta, which is simply tan of theta. So if
172:55 - I want to graph y equals tan of x, I can think
of x as being the angle and y as being the
173:03 - slope of the line at that angle. Notice if
the angle is zero, the slope is zero. But
173:18 - as the angle increases towards pi over two,
the slope gets bigger and bigger heading towards
173:26 - infinity. As the angle goes from zero towards
negative pi over two, the slope is getting
173:37 - negative and heading towards negative infinity
at exactly pi over two and negative pi over
173:44 - two, we have a vertical line. And so the slope
is undefined.
173:51 - Using this information, let's graph a rough
sketch of y equals tan x. Remember, we're
173:58 - thinking of x as the angle and y as the slope,
we're going to go between an angle of negative
174:06 - pi over two and pi over two. So we said that
the slope was zero when the angle is zero,
174:15 - and then it heads up towards positive infinity
as we go towards the angle goes towards pi
174:21 - over two with an undefined value at pi over
two, it goes negative heading towards negative
174:27 - infinity as the angle heads towards negative
pi over two, also with an undefined value
174:33 - at negative pi over two. You can also verify
that for angles slightly bigger than pi over
174:39 - two, we have the same line as for angles that
are approaching negative pi over two, and
174:48 - therefore this picture repeats and it turns
out that tangent is periodic With period not
175:04 - to pi, like sine and cosine, but just pi,
the period of pi makes sense because if you
175:10 - take a line and rotate it by 180 degrees,
it's the same line with the same slope, and
175:17 - therefore has the same value of tangents.
In this graph of y equals 10x, notice that
175:25 - the x intercepts, all right values of x have
the form negative two pi, negative pi, zero,
175:36 - pi, two pi, etc, you can write that as pi
times k, where k is an integer, that is a
175:47 - positive or negative whole number or zero.
This makes a lot of sense because tangent
175:53 - of x is sine of x over cosine of x. And so
you're going to get x intercepts, that's where
176:01 - y is zero, which is where the numerator is
zero, and sine x is zero, at values of the
176:10 - form pi, two pi, and so on. From the graph,
you can see the vertical asymptotes are at
176:18 - values like negative three pi over two, negative
pi over two, pi over two, and three pi over
176:25 - two, these values can be written as pi over
two times k, where k is an odd integer. Again,
176:34 - this makes sense from the definition of tangents
since vertical asymptotes, will occur where
176:40 - the denominator is zero, and cosine x is zero,
at numbers, like negative pi over two pi over
176:48 - two, three pi over two, and so on, the domain
of tangent is the x axis for which it's defined.
176:54 - So that's going to be everything except for
the vertical asymptotes, we can write that
176:59 - as x such that x is not equal to pi over two
times k, for K, an odd integer. The range
177:09 - or the y values go all the way from negative
infinity to infinity. And the period, as we
177:17 - mentioned previously, is pi. Since the smallest
repeating unit has a horizontal width of pi,
177:27 - to graph y equals secant x, I'm going to remember
that secant is one over cosine. So if I start
177:36 - with a graph of cosine, I can take the reciprocal
of the y values to get the graph of secant,
177:43 - the reciprocal of one is one, the reciprocal
of zero is undefined, so I'm not going to
177:50 - have a value at pi over two, negative pi over
two, three pi over two, or negative three
177:58 - pi over two. When I take the reciprocal of
numbers, just less than one, I'm going to
178:03 - get numbers just greater than one, but I would
take the reciprocal of positive numbers getting
178:09 - close to zero, I'm going to get really big
positive numbers going up towards infinity.
178:15 - Similarly, on the other side, over here, I
have numbers close to zero, but negative,
178:24 - so their reciprocals will be negative numbers
heading towards negative infinity. The reciprocal
178:30 - of negative one is negative one. And similarly
here, so I'm getting kind of positive and
178:37 - negative buckets and upside down buckets as
the graph of my sequence.
178:44 - Notice that secant has a period of two pi,
which makes sense, since cosine has a period
178:50 - of two pi, it has a range that goes from negative
infinity to negative one inclusive, and from
178:58 - one to infinity. That makes sense because
the range of cosine is between one and negative
179:04 - one, and we're taking the reciprocal of those
values. The domain is everything except for
179:10 - the vertical asymptotes. Now the vertical
asymptotes are where cosine is zero. So that
179:19 - is at values of the form pi over two, three
pi over two, etc. That's values of the form
179:28 - pi over 2k, where k is an odd integer. So
the domain is going to be x values such that
179:37 - x is not equal to pi over 2k. For K and odd
integer. The x intercepts of secant Well,
179:47 - it doesn't have any, because you can't take
one over something and get the numbers zero
179:54 - for your y value. We've seen the graph of
y equals Tana x and y equals secant x. This
180:05 - is the graph of y equals cotangent x. It looks
similar to the graph of tangent x, it's just
180:12 - a decreasing function instead of an increasing
one, and it has its vertical asymptotes. And
180:19 - it's x intercepts in different places. Finally,
this green graph is the graph of y equals
180:27 - cosecant x. It's related to the graph of sine
x, since cosecant is one over sine x, and
180:36 - in fact, if I draw the graph of sine x in
between, you can see how it kind of bounces
180:41 - off. Because it's the reciprocal. I encourage
you to memorize the general shape of these
180:49 - graphs, you can always figure out the details
by thinking how about how they're related
180:54 - to the graphs of cosine of x, and sine x.
This video is an introduction to solving trig
181:07 - equations. Let's start with the equation two
cosine x plus one equals zero, I want to find
181:14 - all the solutions in the interval from zero
to two pi, and then get a general formula
181:18 - for all solutions, not just those in that
interval. Let me start by rewriting this equation
181:25 - to isolate the tricky part, which is cosine
of x. So I'm going to write to cosine x equals
181:34 - negative one, and then divide both sides by
two. Now I'm looking for the angles x between
181:42 - zero and two pi, whose cosine is negative
one half. Since negative one half is one of
181:49 - the special values on the unit circle, I can
use my knowledge of the unit circle, to see
181:56 - that the angle between zero and two pi must
be either two pi over three, or four pi over
182:07 - three, my answer needs to include both of
these values. There are no other spots on
182:12 - the unit circle whose cosine is negative one
half. But there are more angles, because we
182:18 - can always take one of these angles and add
multiples of two pi to it. So if I want to
182:23 - find all solutions, I can take these two principles
solutions, two pi over three, and four pi
182:31 - over three, and simply add multiples of two
pi to them. For example, two pi over three
182:37 - plus two pi, or two pi over three minus two
pi, two pi over three plus four pi, and so
182:46 - on. A much more efficient way to write this
is to write two pi over three plus two pi
182:55 - times k, any integer that is any positive
or negative whole number or zero. Similarly,
183:05 - I can write four pi over three plus two pi
k, to capture all solutions, based on the
183:14 - principal solution for pi over three by adding
and subtracting multiples of two pi.
183:19 - This is my final solution. Next, let's look
at a tricky equation involving tangent. As
183:29 - usual, I'm going to start out by cleaning
things up and isolating the tricky part, which
183:33 - in this case is tangent. So let me add tangent
to both sides. That'll give me three, tan
183:43 - x equals the square root of three. And so
tan x is the square root of three over three.
183:51 - The square root of three over three looks
suspiciously similar to value the value of
183:56 - square to three over two, which is a special
value on my unit circle. So my suspicion is
184:01 - that my unit circle will again help me find
this value of x without a calculator. Recall
184:08 - that tan x is sine x over cosine x. So I'm
looking for angles on the unit circle between
184:17 - zero and two pi with a ratio of sine over
cosine will give me square root of three over
184:23 - three, I actually only need to look in the
first quadrant and the third quadrant, because
184:29 - those are the quadrants where a tangent is
positive. And I really only need to look at
184:36 - angles whose either sine or cosine has a squared
of three in it. So by trial and error, I can
184:43 - see that tan pi over six, which is sine pi
over six over cosine pi over six will give
184:56 - me one half over root three over two That's
the same thing as one half times two over
185:02 - three, which is one over root three. If I
rationalize that, I get root three over three,
185:09 - so that value works. If I try tan of pi over
three, instead, I get root three, which is
185:20 - not equal to root three over three. So pi
over three doesn't work. Similarly, I can
185:26 - work out some the values in the third quadrant,
and see that seven pi over six works. But
185:35 - four pi over three does not. So my answer
to part A includes just the two values, pi
185:44 - over six, and seven pi over six. Now if I
want to find all solutions, not just those
185:53 - in the interval from zero to two pi, I noticed
that I can take one of these principal solutions,
185:59 - and add multiples of two pi to it, because
that'll give me the same angle. So I get pi
186:06 - over six plus two pi k, and pi over six, sorry,
seven pi over six plus two pi, K, any integer.
186:22 - This is a correct answer. But it's not as
simple as it could be. Notice that seven pi
186:27 - over six over here on the unit circle is exactly
pi more than pi over six. So instead of taking
186:34 - both of these and adding multiples of two
pi to them, I could get all the same answers
186:39 - by just taking one of them and adding multiples
of pi to it. So a more efficient answer is
186:46 - to say that x equals pi over six, plus pi
times k, for K any integer. This will still
186:57 - capture all the same solutions. Because when
k is even, I'll get this family solutions.
187:03 - And when k is odd, I'll get this family. For
example, when k is one, pi over six plus one
187:10 - times pi is just the original seven pi over
six. If you think about the fact that tangent
187:17 - has a period of pi, instead of two pi, it
makes a lot of sense that you should be able
187:22 - to write the solutions in this form. In this
video, we solved basic trig equations by first
187:32 - isolating sine, or tangent, or the same thing
would work with cosine. And then using the
187:41 - unit circle, to find principal solutions.
Principal solutions are just solutions between
187:51 - zero and two pi. And then adding multiples
of two pi to these principal solutions to
188:03 - get all solutions. For tangent, we noticed
that it was equivalent to just use one principal
188:09 - solution and add multiples of pi instead of
two pi. In this video, we'll introduce the
188:17 - idea of the derivative using graphs, secant
lines and tangent lines.
188:24 - So I have a function here, drawn in black,
the function is y equals f of x. But actually
188:31 - here f of x equals x squared. I also have
a tangent line to my function drawn in red.
188:39 - This tangent line is the tangent line at the
point 1.5 2.25. By a tangent line, I mean
188:49 - a line that touches the graph of my function
at this one point, and heads off in the same
188:54 - direction as the function. Well, normally
to compute the slope, we need two points.
188:59 - But for the tangent line, we really only have
the exact coordinates of this one point, we
189:05 - could approximate the slope by guessing the
coordinates of some other points on the red
189:09 - line. But in the long run, we'll end up with
a more accurate estimate if we do something
189:13 - else. So what we're going to do instead is
we're going to calculate the slope of a secant
189:19 - line. A secant line is a line that goes through
two points on my graph. So in this case, my
189:26 - secant line is going through my original point,
and this other point at x equals three. So
189:31 - that's the point three, three squared or three
nine. Okay, so here's my secant line. To calculate
189:38 - the slope of my secant line, I use the fact
that slope is rise over run. Or in other words,
189:43 - it's the change in y over the change in x.
And that's going to be written in function
189:48 - notation. F of three minus f of 1.5 is giving
me the change in y and three minus one point
189:59 - gives me the change in x. Wilson's f of x
is x squared, this is the same thing as three
190:05 - squared minus 1.5 squared over three minus
1.5. So that's just nine minus 2.25, over
190:12 - 1.5, which ends up as 4.5. So 4.5 is the slope
of this second line. Well, the idea here is
190:22 - that the slope of my secant line is an approximation
of the slope of my tangent line. But in this
190:29 - example, really the secant line that I've
used, it's, its slope is only a very rough
190:34 - approximation of the tangent line, not very
accurate, all. So how could I get a better
190:39 - approximation of the slope of my tangent line?
Well, one thing I could do is I could use
190:46 - as my second point, instead of using this
point way out here, I could use a point closer
190:52 - to my first point. So for example, I could
use the point two, f of two. In other words,
191:00 - the point two, four, as my second point for
my second line, so let me draw that. And let
191:06 - me calculate its slope, which after some arithmetic
is going to give me an answer of 3.5. Well,
191:12 - I could continue to pick second points for
my secant line, closer and closer to my first
191:20 - point. And I should end up with more and more
accurate approximations of my tangent line,
191:26 - let me make a little chart for this. For my
next secant line, I could take my second point,
191:32 - something pretty close to 1.5, say 1.6. And
after some arithmetic, I get a slope of 3.1.
191:38 - To take my second point to be 1.51, that's
going to give me a slope of 3.01, and so on.
191:47 - To write this more generally, if I take my
second point as x, then the slope of my secant
191:53 - line is going to be given by again the rise
over the run. So that's going to be f of x
192:00 - minus f of 1.5 divided by x minus 1.5. Change
in y over the change in x, that's my slope.
192:12 - Now, there's no reason I necessarily have
to take my second point to be on the right
192:19 - side of my first point, I could be using stead
points on the left side here. Continue with
192:26 - my chart, letting my second point be one,
I can do the same computations to get a slope
192:33 - of a secant line of 2.5. Here, I could get
even closer on the left, say something like
192:39 - 1.4 and get a slope of 2.9, and so on. In
general, if I have a point x f of x, and I
192:48 - use a secant line through that point in our
original point, I calculate the slope as change
192:55 - in y over change in x, which is going to be
f of 1.5 minus f of x divided by 1.5 minus
193:08 - x.
193:10 - Actually, I can rewrite this a little bit
to make it look more like the expression up
193:15 - here. If I multiply the numerator and denominator
by negative one, then I can rewrite this as
193:21 - f of x minus f of 1.5 divided by x minus 1.5.
So that these two expressions look exactly
193:31 - the same. So the only difference here on my
mind is that over here, I was thinking of
193:37 - x as being a little bit bigger than 1.5. And
here I'm thinking of x as being a little smaller
193:42 - than 1.5. But I get the exact same expression
for the slope of the secant line either way.
193:48 - Now, this process of picking points closer
and closer to our original point from the
193:52 - left, and from the right, should remind you
of limits. And indeed, the slope of the tangent
193:58 - line is the limit as x goes to 1.5 of the
slope of my secant lines, which are given
194:07 - by this expression. This quantity is so important
that's given its own name, it's called the
194:13 - derivative of f of x at x equals 1.5. So in
other words, the derivative which is written
194:19 - as f prime at 1.5, is the limit as x goes
to 1.5 of f of x minus f of 1.5 over x minus
194:32 - 1.5. Now based on our numerical tables, for
example, here, we can see that that limit
194:40 - seems to be heading towards three, whether
X approaches 1.5, from the right or from the
194:45 - left. So I'll write down the answer of three.
You know, it's pretty strong. If you wanted
194:54 - to have a really precise argument. We'd actually
need to use algebra to compute this limit.
195:00 - Exactly using the formula for the function
itself, f of x equals x squared. And we'll
195:07 - do examples like that in a future video. But
for now, the main point is just that the slope
195:13 - of the tangent line is the limit of the slope
of the secant lines, which is given by this
195:18 - formula. For now, let's look at an animation
that shows how the slope of our secant lines
195:26 - approach the slope of our tangent line. So
this black curve here is the function y equals
195:31 - x squared. The red line is the tangent line
through the point where x equals 1.5. And
195:37 - the blue line is a secant line that goes through
the point with x coordinate 1.5. And a second
195:43 - point with x coordinate 2.5. The points are
shown here on the right. So I'm going to use
195:48 - this slider here and drag my second point
closer to my first point. So notice how as
195:55 - the x coordinate, my second point gets closer
and closer to 1.5. My secant line is getting
196:01 - closer and closer to my tangent line. So the
slope of my tangent line really is the limit
196:07 - of the slope of my secant lines, as my x coordinate
of my second point goes to 1.5. So this is
196:13 - true, even if I start with my second point
on the left instead of the right, as I drag
196:17 - that second point closer and closer to the
first point, the slope of my secant lines
196:22 - gets closer and closer to the slope of that
red tangent line. We saw in our example, that
196:30 - the slope of our tangent line, or the derivative
at 1.5, was given by the limit as x goes to
196:38 - 1.5 of f of x minus f of 1.5 divided by x
minus 1.5. Well, in general, the derivative
196:50 - of a function y equals f of x at an x value
a is given by f prime of A equals the limit
197:00 - as x goes to a of f of x minus F of A over
x minus a, the function is said to be differentiable
197:11 - at A. If this limit exists. In particular,
both the limit from the left and a limit from
197:21 - the right have to exist and be equal for the
function to be differentiable
197:25 - at x equals a.
197:26 - There's another equivalent version of the
definition of derivative that's very common
197:32 - and very useful. If we're looking at the graph
of a function, I'm trying to calculate the
197:38 - slope of the secant line between the points
A, F of A and x f of x, then let's introduce
197:46 - the letter H to be the quantity x minus a.
So h represents the run, when I'm calculating
197:54 - the slope of this secant line, I can write
H equals x minus a, or equivalently x equals
198:02 - a plus H. And so I can rewrite the definition
of derivative in terms of H as f prime of
198:10 - A equals the limit as x goes to a of f of
a plus h minus F of A divided by h, just by
198:22 - substituting in this expression for x. And
h for x minus a. Well as x goes to a, x minus
198:32 - a is going to zero. In other words, h is going
to zero. So this is equivalent to the limit
198:40 - as h goes to zero of f of a plus h minus f
of a over h. One way to think of this is that
198:49 - we're just relabeling this point right here,
as the point A plus h, f of a plus H. And
198:57 - the slope of the tangent line is still the
limit of the rise over the run as the run
199:05 - goes to zero, this is the definition of derivative
that we'll use most frequently going forward
199:11 - when we actually calculate derivatives based
on the definition in future videos. But for
199:16 - now, let's look at some examples to practice
recognizing the derivative rather than computing
199:20 - it. So each of these following two expressions
are supposed to represent the derivative of
199:26 - some function at some value a. So for each
example, we're supposed to find the function
199:30 - and figure out the value of A. Now remember,
we've got two definitions of derivative going
199:35 - on. They're both equivalent, but they look
different. One of them looks like derivative
199:40 - of f at a is the limit as x goes to a of f
of x minus F of A over x minus a. And the
199:49 - other version is the limit as h goes to zero
of f of a plus h minus f of a over h. Now,
199:59 - you might notice That our first expression
looks more like this first definition, because
200:06 - x is going to some number that's not zero.
And we have both x and a number in the denominator
200:12 - here. Whereas our second expression looks
more like the second definition, we've got
200:17 - the age going to zero, and we've just got
the age on the denominator here. Okay, so
200:22 - let's look at this first one here. First,
let's figure out what A is here. It seems
200:28 - like a has got to be negative one. Since x
is approaching negative one. That kind of
200:33 - makes sense, because now here on the denominator,
x plus one could be thought of as x minus
200:39 - negative one. So that's our x minus a with
a is negative one. Okay, great. So we've got
200:45 - a, now we need to find an F. And we will need
the numerator here to look like f of x minus
200:52 - f of a, well, let's try the simplest thing,
we can, let's try f of x equals x plus five
201:00 - squared, then X plus five squared is our f
of x. and f of a is our f of negative one
201:10 - is going to be negative one plus five squared,
which is 16. So that matches up perfectly,
201:16 - we've got our f of x here, our f of a here,
and our x minus a at the bottom. That's exactly
201:23 - the definition of derivative done the first
one. All right, now the second one. Now, again,
201:28 - we need to figure out what a is. And we need
to find figure out what f is. This part of
201:34 - the expression here is supposed to be f of
a plus h. So I'm going to guess, make a guess
201:40 - here, that f of x should be three to some
power, let's just try three to the X and see
201:47 - how that works. Now we need this nine to be
f of a. So nine has to be three to the A.
201:56 - And the only way that can work is if a is
two. So continuing on the top, we need f of
202:05 - a plus h, that is f of two plus h,
202:11 - two B three to the two plus H and that actually
works perfectly. If our f of x is three to
202:18 - the x, it's all falling into place. So we've
got our f of two plus h, r f of two, and r
202:27 - h. And it all works where f of x being three
to the x and a being two. In this video, we
202:37 - introduced the idea of derivative as a slope
of a tangent line. And we gave two equivalent
202:43 - definitions of the derivative in terms of
limits. We'll continue with some interpretations
202:51 - of derivatives in the next video. This video
is algebraically intensive, and is concerned
202:59 - with calculating derivatives using the limit
definition of derivative. Well, there are
203:03 - actually two versions of the limit definition
of derivative. And I'll mostly use this one,
203:09 - the limit as h goes to zero of f of a plus
h minus f of a over h. If you're interested,
203:18 - you can try reworking the problems using the
alternative definition of derivative. The
203:24 - limit as x goes to a of f of x minus F of
A over x minus a first example, find the derivative
203:35 - of f of x, which is one over the square root
of three minus x at x equals negative one.
203:41 - Well, in other words, we want to find f prime
of negative one. So that's the limit as h
203:50 - goes to zero of f of negative one plus h minus
f of negative one over h. Using our definition
204:02 - of f, that's the limit of one over the square
root of three minus negative one plus h minus
204:16 - one over the square root of three minus negative
one, all over h. Let me clean this up a bit.
204:23 - So this is one over the square root of, let's
see, it's three minus negative one, so that's
204:30 - three plus one, or four minus h minus one
over the square root of four
204:38 - over h. And I guess I can replace the square
root of four with two.
204:43 - Now, unfortunately, I can't just evaluate
this by plugging in H equals zero, because
204:49 - if I try that, I get one of these zero over
zero indeterminate forms. You'll run across
204:54 - these a lot when calculating derivatives by
definition, it kind of makes sense because
204:58 - remember the context where computing slopes
of secant lines as these points get closer
205:04 - and closer together. So our rise and our runs
are both going to zero. So it makes sense,
205:09 - we'll get these zero or zero indeterminate
forms, we have to use our algebraic tricks
205:13 - that we learned before, for rewriting our
expression in a way that we can calculate
205:18 - the limit. And I see two things going on here,
there's square roots lurking, and there's
205:24 - also fractions. So it's anybody's guess which
trick I might want to apply First, the trick
205:30 - for square roots, which would be multiplying
the top and the bottom by the conjugate. And
205:35 - the trick for fractions, which would be adding
together my fraction for the common denominator.
205:41 - I guess I'll try my fraction trick first.
So my common denominator for my two fractions
205:48 - here, is just the product of these two denominators.
So that's the square root of four minus h
205:55 - times two. Let me rewrite my fractions with
this common denominator. Continuing here,
206:05 - I get the limit of two minus the square root
of four minus h over squared, a four minus
206:14 - h times two, all over h. instead of dividing
by H, let me multiply by one over h. And let's
206:26 - see here, let's see if we can evaluate by
plugging in H equals zero at this stage. Unfortunately,
206:32 - when I try to plug in, I'm still getting the
zero of zero indeterminate form. But I'm not
206:41 - out of tricks, I haven't used the conjugate
trick yet. So let's try multiplying the top
206:47 - and the bottom by the conjugate of the top.
Once I multiply out here, I'll get four plus
206:59 - two square to four minus h minus two square
to four minus h, minus the square root of
207:05 - four minus h squared, that's going to cancel
out nicely. And on the bottom, I have two
207:12 - h squared of four minus h times two plus square
to four minus h, I'll leave that factored
207:20 - for now. That's good thing, I have unlimited
space here, I'm kind of need it. Now on the
207:27 - numerator, I'm going to get four minus four
minus h, is carrying the denominator along
207:37 - for the ride now, oh, I see something good.
I see in the numerator, we're getting a four
207:46 - minus four plus H. Subtracting out those fours
to zero, and then cancelling out, my H is
207:57 - that divide by each other, I think I finally
got something that I can evaluate without
208:02 - getting a zero over zero indeterminate form.
All right, so here we've got. So as h goes
208:10 - to zero, I'm just going to get one over two
times the square root of four times two plus
208:18 - a squared of four, which equals 1/16. So by
now, you may have forgotten what the original
208:28 - problem was, I think I have it, let's go back
up here, we were looking for the derivative
208:34 - of f of x, which was one over a squared of
three minus x at x equals negative one, we
208:40 - set up the limit definition, did a bunch of
algebra first adding together fractions, then
208:46 - using the conjugate trick, and eventually
found that that derivative equaled 1/16. The
208:53 - algebra doesn't get much harder than this
problem here. In this next example, we're
208:58 - asked to find the equation of the tangent
line to y equals x cubed minus 3x at x equals
209:04 - two. So the slope of the tangent line is given
by the derivative, f prime of two. So let's
209:12 - calculate the derivative first. f prime of
two is the limit as h goes to zero of f of
209:20 - two plus h minus f of two, all over h. So
that's the limit of two plus h cubed minus
209:31 - three times two plus h minus
209:36 - two cubed minus three times two. I'm just
plugging in first two plus h for x in the
209:43 - definition of my function, and then I'm plugging
in two for x. Now all of that needs to be
209:50 - over h. Once again, if I try to plug in zero
for H in these expressions, I'm just gonna
209:59 - get something that all cancels out to zero
at the top, and also have zero at the bottom,
210:04 - one of my classic zero over zero indeterminate
forms. So instead, I need to use algebra to
210:09 - simplify things. And hope I can calculate
the limit after that. So a good trick for
210:16 - simplifying here is to multiply out two plus
h cubed multiplies out to two cubed, plus
210:27 - three times two squared times h, plus three
times two times h squared plus h cubed. I'm
210:38 - getting this from the formula for multiplying
out of cubic which I've memorized. But you
210:43 - can also get it more slowly just by writing
out two plus h times itself three times and,
210:50 - and distributing. Now I need to subtract three
times two, and three times h. And finally,
211:02 - I needed to subtract my two cubed and then
add my three times to all this over h. Now
211:11 - if you have my terms cancel out to zero here,
two cubed minus two cubed. And let's see I've
211:17 - got a minus three times two and a plus three
times two. And I notice all the terms that
211:24 - are left have H's and so I'm going to factor
out an H from the top from the remaining terms
211:34 - here. And that gives me let's say, three times
two squared, so that's 12, plus six H, plus
211:46 - h squared minus three over h. Now, h divided
by h is one. So I'm just left with the limit
212:00 - as h goes to zero of 12 plus six h plus h
squared minus three, as h goes to zero, I
212:08 - can just plug in H zero, and I get 12 minus
three, which is nine. So my slope of my tangent
212:16 - line, my derivative is nine. I'm not quite
done, I still need to find the equation of
212:22 - the tangent line, I just know that its slope
is nine. So the equation of the tangent line
212:26 - equation of any line is something like y equals
mx plus b. and here m is nine. So I have y
212:33 - equals 9x plus b, I just need to find the
intercept B. Now, usually, to find the intercept,
212:41 - I need a plug in a point. what point do I
have here to plug in? Well, remember, we're
212:48 - talking about a tangent line here. So we've
got the point of tangency, the point where
212:53 - x equals two, and the corresponding y value
is y equals two cubed minus three times two,
213:01 - or two. So my tangent line has to go through
the point to two, which means if I plug in
213:10 - this point for x and y, I get two equals nine
times two plus b, which means that B has to
213:17 - equal negative 16. So the equation of my tangent
line then becomes y equals 9x minus 16. I
213:29 - found that by first calculating the derivative
to get my slope, and then using the point
213:34 - of tangency, plugging in the x value to get
the y value, and plugging Matt in to get b
213:40 - to finish off the equation. So in this video,
we used our tricks for evaluating limits algebraically
213:48 - to compute some derivatives, using the definition
of derivative. This is pretty labor intensive.
213:54 - So fortunately, pretty soon, we'll learn some
shortcut methods for calculating derivatives
213:59 - without resorting to the definition. We've
seen that the derivative of a function y equals
214:06 - f of x at a point, x equals A represents the
slope of a tangent line through the point
214:13 - A f of a. But if the function f of x represents
some practical quantity, like distance as
214:20 - a function of time, or fuel efficiency as
a function of speed, then the derivative will
214:25 - also have a practical interpretation. This
video is about interpreting the derivative
214:30 - in different contexts.
214:34 - One of the most famous contexts for interpreting
derivatives is problems involving motion.
214:40 - So let's say I'm on a bike ride, heading straight
north from campus. And let's suppose that
214:47 - y equals f of x represents my distance from
campus. So x is the time and hours and y or
214:55 - f of x is my distance and miles, the distance
away from campus. Distance north of campus.
215:03 - It's kind of fun to see what this graph here
means in terms of my bike ride. In particular,
215:09 - what's going on up here, where my y values
reach their maximum. And what about here,
215:14 - where my function is constant. Please pause
the video for a moment and see if you can
215:18 - make up a story that fits the graph. So here
at the top, my distance is no longer increasing,
215:25 - it's actually starting to decrease. So I must
have turned around and be heading back towards
215:30 - campus again, over here, where my f of x is
constant, I probably stopped at a coffee shop
215:37 - to take a rest or maybe I'm fixing a flat
tire. Now let's get to the questions at hand.
215:44 - Consider these two points, three, f of three,
and four F of four, we want to interpret the
215:54 - slope of the secant line through those two
points. Slope is change in y over change in
216:01 - x. And y here is distance and x here is time.
So change in distance over change in time.
216:10 - Sounds a lot like speed, or more accurately,
velocity. Velocity just means speed in a certain
216:19 - direction, and is positive. If distance is
increasing, and negative if it's decreasing.
216:25 - Speed is the absolute value of velocity, and
there's always positive or zero. So in our
216:32 - case, the velocity here must be negative,
because our distance is decreasing. And we
216:37 - could estimate it very roughly as about, say
four minus 12 over four minus three, so about
216:47 - negative eight miles per hour. But what is
this negative eight miles per hour refer
216:52 - to.
216:53 - Since we're looking at the change in distance,
over this entire hour long interval, the slope
217:01 - of my secant line gives my average velocity
over this interval. It doesn't give my exact
217:08 - velocity, and exactly three hours or exactly
four hours, only my average velocity. If I
217:16 - want to know my exact velocity at exactly
three hours, I need to look instead at the
217:21 - slope of the tangent line at x equals three.
The velocity at an exact instant of time is
217:27 - sometimes called the instantaneous velocity
to distinguish it from the average velocity
217:34 - over a time interval. Let's think for a minute
about why the velocity at exactly three hours
217:41 - is given by the slope of the tangent line.
We saw in a previous video that the slope
217:47 - of the tangent line is the limit of the slope
of the secant lines More precisely, the limit
217:54 - as x goes to three of f of x minus f of three
over x minus three. Wow, well, each of these
218:03 - ratios represents an average velocity on the
interval from three to x. And so the limit
218:09 - is the limit of average velocities on tinier
and tinier intervals of time, one minute,
218:14 - one second 100th of a second, in the limit,
as the length of the time interval goes to
218:20 - zero, we're going to get the exact velocity
at exactly three hours. So to repeat, in this
218:28 - example, the slope of the secant line represents
the average velocity over time interval, and
218:34 - the derivative at x equals three, written
f prime of three, which is also the slope
218:40 - of the tangent line, that derivative represents
the instantaneous velocity at x equals three.
218:48 - More generally, if f of x represents any quantity
that's changing, then the slope of the secant
218:57 - line represents an average rate of change.
While the slope of the tangent line, f prime
219:06 - of a represents an instantaneous rate of change.
Let's see how that works in a couple of other
219:13 - examples. Let's suppose that f of x represents
the temperature of a cup of coffee and degrees
219:19 - Fahrenheit as a function of time and minutes
since he said it on the counter. So let's
219:25 - interpret the first equation. f of zero is
140. Well, that just means that at time zero,
219:32 - the temperature is 140 degrees. What about
the equation f of 10 minus f of zero is negative
219:41 - 20. That's saying that the temperature goes
down by 20 degrees as x the time goes from
219:49 - zero to 10 minutes. Now, what about this quotient
here being equal to negative two? Well, this
219:57 - quotient looks a lot like the slope of a secant
Why, right, so it must be an average rate
220:02 - of change. And in this context, we have the
temperature is decreasing by an average of
220:11 - two degrees per minute, as x changes from
zero to 10 minutes. Finally, the derivative
220:20 - of f at 15 is negative point five means that
at exactly 15 minutes, the temperature is
220:29 - decreasing at a rate of point five degrees
per minute. negative numbers here always mean
220:37 - decreasing, and f prime is an instantaneous
rate of change. Let's look at another example.
220:45 - Please pause the video and try this one for
yourself. Here g of x represents the fuel
220:51 - efficiency of a Toyota Prius and mpg as a
function of x, the speed in miles per hour
220:56 - that is traveling g of 45 is 52 means that
at 45 miles per hour, the fuel efficiency
221:07 - is 52 miles per gallon. The second statement
is saying that as speed increases from 35
221:15 - to 45 miles per hour, fuel efficiency goes
up by 10. That's 10 miles per gallon. The
221:24 - third statement says that the average rate
of change
221:29 - of fuel efficiency is two miles per gallon
per mile per hour, as speed increases from
221:38 - 35 to 40 miles per hour. So going up from
35 to 40, gives you better fuel efficiency
221:45 - here. On the other hand, when you're going
60 miles per hour, your fuel efficiency is
221:52 - decreasing at a rate of two miles per gallon
per mile per hour. So I bet the optimal fuel
222:04 - efficiency here occurs somewhere between 40
and 60 miles per hour. In this video, we've
222:12 - interpreted the slope of the secant line as
the average rate of change, and the slope
222:19 - of the tangent line with the derivative as
an instantaneous rate of change. I hope that
222:26 - these general principles will help you interpret
the derivative in a variety of contexts that
222:29 - you might encounter throughout your life.
In this video, we'll think of the derivative
222:36 - of a function as being a function in itself,
we relate the graph of a function to the graph
222:42 - of its derivative, and we'll talk about where
the derivative does not exist. We've seen
222:49 - that for a function f of x and a number A,
the derivative of f of x at x equals A is
222:56 - given by this formula. But what if we let
a very, if we compute f prime of a lots of
223:04 - different values of a, we can think of the
derivative of f prime as itself being a function,
223:10 - I'm going to rewrite this definition of derivative
with x in the place of a just to make it look
223:14 - a little more like standard function notation.
So f prime as a function of x is the limit
223:20 - as h goes to zero of f of x plus h minus f
of x over h. This isn't anything substantially
223:29 - different from what we've been doing before,
it's just a difference in perspective. So
223:34 - let's do one more example of computing the
derivative by hand using the definition, but
223:39 - a general number x instead of a specific value,
the function we're going to use is f of x
223:44 - equals one over x. And first, let's just write
down the definition of derivative in general.
223:49 - So f prime of x is given by this formula.
And using the fact that f of x is one over
223:56 - x, I can rewrite this as one over x plus h
minus one over x all over h. So as usual,
224:07 - this is a zero over zero indeterminate form.
If I plug in zero for H, I'm just going to
224:12 - get one over x minus one over x on the numerator,
which is zero. and plugging in zero for H
224:17 - gives me zero on the denominator two. So I'll
need to use some algebra to rewrite things
224:23 - to get an A form that I can evaluate it. Let's
add together our fractions in the numerator
224:28 - here. The common denominator I need to use
is x plus h times x. So I multiply this fraction
224:35 - by x over x and the next fraction by x plus
h over x plus h. All that's over h. And now
224:42 - continuing, I get x minus x plus h over x
plus h times X and instead of dividing the
224:53 - whole thing by h here, multiply by one over
h to get the limit have x minus x minus h
225:04 - over x plus h times x times h. Now I can subtract
off my x's here. And after I do that, I can
225:14 - divide my minus h by my H, to get just a minus
one on the numerator here. So that's just
225:22 - the limit of negative one over x plus h times
x. And now I'm in a good position because
225:28 - I can plug in H equals zero and get something
that makes sense. Namely, I'm getting a limit
225:34 - of negative one over x plus zero times x or
negative one over x squared as my derivative.
225:45 - In this example, we're given the graph of
a function that's supposed to represent the
225:51 - height of an alien spaceship above the Earth's
surface, we want to graph the rate of change.
225:59 - The rate of change means the derivative of
our function, but we're not given an equation
226:03 - to work with. So we'll just have to estimate
the derivative based on the shape of the graph
226:08 - by thinking about slopes of tangent lines.
I'll start by drawing a new set of axes where
226:15 - I can graph my derivative. And I'll consider
my original function, which I'll call g of
226:22 - x, piece by piece.
226:26 - For x values between zero and two, my original
function g of x looks like a line, it has
226:32 - slope negative one, since the rise is negative
two, while the run is two, for any point on
226:41 - the straight line segment, the tangent line
will also be a straight line with slope negative
226:47 - one, and therefore, the derivative will be
negative one. For x values between zero and
226:53 - two, I'm going to ignore the time being what
happens when x is exactly zero or exactly
227:00 - two, and just look at the interval of X values
between two and three. Here, g of x is completely
227:08 - flat. So tangent lines at any of these points
will have slope zero. And I'll draw a derivative
227:14 - of zero. When x is between two and three,
I'll postpone worrying about the derivative
227:20 - when x is exactly three. And just think about
the derivative when x is between three and
227:26 - five, where g of x is flat again, so it's
tangent lines will have slopes of zero. And
227:33 - I'll draw again, a derivative is zero when
x is between three and five. Now things get
227:40 - a little more interesting. As x increases
from five to about seven, g of x is an increasing
227:50 - function. The slope of tangent lines here
are positive, starting at about, say, a slope
227:57 - of three, and decreasing to a slope of zero,
when x is seven, I can draw that down here.
228:09 - As x increases from seven, the tangent lines
now have negative slopes, going to a maximum
228:18 - negative slope of about negative one here,
and then heading towards a slope of zero,
228:24 - when x is just shy of 10. My estimates of
three and negative one for the slopes of my
228:33 - tangent lines are just rough estimates based
on approximating the rise over the run. As
228:40 - x increases from 10, the tangent line slope
is positive, and getting steeper and steeper,
228:48 - so my derivative is going to be positive and
increasing. That's the basic shape of the
228:55 - derivative. Now let's see what happens at
these special points like 235 and zero. To
229:03 - figure out the derivative at x equals two,
let's go back to the definition of derivative
229:08 - as the limit of the slopes of the secant lines.
If I draw a secant line, using a point on
229:15 - the left, I'll just get this line that lines
up with this line and has a slope of negative
229:22 - one. But if I compute the slope of a secant
line, using a point on the right, I'll get
229:27 - a slope of zero. So the limit from the left
and the limit from the right of the slopes
229:33 - of my secret lines will be different. And
so my limit does not exist and my derivative
229:38 - does not exist. And so I'll just draw this
as an open circle at x equals two. Next, let's
229:44 - look at the derivative when x equals three.
Remember that the derivative at three is the
229:52 - limit as h goes to zero, of g of three plus
h minus g of three over eight. Well, if H
230:02 - is bigger than zero, then g of three plus
H is going to be about a half, because three
230:11 - plus H is to the right of three. On the other
hand, if H is less than zero, g of three,
230:18 - plus H is two, because three plus H is actually
a number less than three, g of three itself
230:27 - is equal to one half, based on the filled
in bubble here. so if we calculate the limit,
230:35 - as h goes to zero from the positive side,
we get the limit of one half minus one half
230:44 - over age, which is just the limit of zeros,
so that's zero. On the other hand, if we compute
230:52 - the limit from the left, we get the limit
of two minus a half over eight, which is the
231:00 - limit of three halves over h. And as h goes
to zero, that limit is negative infinity.
231:11 - So once again, the left limit and write limit
are not equal. And so the limit of the slopes
231:17 - of the secant lines does not exist, and there's
no derivative at x equals three. And I'll
231:25 - draw an open circle there to
231:26 - add x equals five, again, we have a corner.
And by the same sort of argument, we can conclude
231:33 - that the derivative does not exist. And finally,
when x equals zero, we can only have a limit
231:42 - from the right not the left. And so by that
sort of technical reason, we don't have a
231:47 - derivative at that left endpoint either. So
we've drawn a rough graph of the rate of change
231:55 - of the height of our alien spaceship, as it
comes closer to Earth beams down to pick up
232:01 - Earthlings and then makes us escape up to
the mothership. It's interesting to observe
232:06 - that the domain of the original function g
of x is from zero to infinity, but the domain
232:13 - of g prime is somewhat smaller, and just goes
from zero to two, then from two to three,
232:21 - then from three to five, and finally, from
five to infinity, missing some places where
232:27 - the function originally existed. We saw in
the previous example, that the derivative
232:34 - doesn't necessarily exist at all the x values
where the original function exists.
232:38 - Please pause the video for a moment and try
to come up with as many different ways as
232:42 - you can, that a derivative can fail to exist
232:46 - at an x value x equals a. Well, one kind of
boring way that a function can fail to
232:52 - have a derivative at x equals A is if f of
x itself fails to exist. at x equals a, for
233:02 - example, if it has a hole, like in this picture,
we saw in the previous example, with the alien
233:08 - spacecraft, that a derivative can fail to
exist when the function turns a corner. When
233:17 - we tried to evaluate the derivative in that
example, by taking the limit of the slope
233:21 - of the secant lines, the limit from the left,
and a limit from the right did not agree.
233:28 - A famous example of a function that turns
a corner is the absolute value function. For
233:35 - the absolute value function, f prime of x
is negative one, since the slope here is negative
233:41 - one, when x is less than zero, and it's positive
one when x is greater than zero, but f prime
233:51 - of zero itself does not exist. A function
with a casp also fails to have a derivative
233:59 - at the cusp. In the alien spaceship example,
we also saw that F can fail to have a derivative
234:07 - at a discontinuity. But there's another way
that a derivative can fail to exist, even
234:14 - when f has no cost per corner discontinuity.
Let's look at the function f of x equals x
234:20 - to the 1/3 graphed here, what's going on at
x equals zero. At that instant, the tangent
234:29 - line is a vertical with a slope that's infinite
or undefined. So the limit of the slopes of
234:36 - the secant lines will fail to exist because
it'll be infinite. A function is called differentiable
234:46 - at x equals a, if the derivative exists at
a function is differentiable on an open interval,
234:54 - if f is differentiable at every point in that
interval. So all of the examples on the
234:59 - previous slides are examples of places where
a function is not differentiable. All of these
235:05 - examples are important. But I'm going to focus
on the example involving discontinuity. In
235:12 - general, if f of x is not continuous at x
equals a, then f is not differentiable at
235:19 - x equals a. This is what we saw in the example
involving the jump discontinuity. an equivalent
235:26 - way of saying the same thing is that f is
differentiable at x equals a, then f has to
235:32 - be continuous at x
235:33 - previous slides are examples of places where
a function is not differentiable. All of these
235:34 - examples are important. But I'm going to focus
on the example involving discontinuity. In
235:35 - general, if f of x is not continuous at x
equals a, then f is not differentiable at
235:36 - x equals a. This is what we saw in the example
involving the jump discontinuity. an equivalent
235:40 - way of saying the same thing is that f is
differentiable at x equals a, then f has to
235:41 - be continuous at x
235:42 - equals a.
235:43 - equals a.
235:44 - However, if all we know is that f is continuous
at x equals a, then we can't conclude anything
235:45 - about whether or not is differentiable there,
f may or may not be differentiable at x equals
235:53 - a. Remember the square root example, the square
root of x is continuous at x equals zero,
236:00 - but it's not differentiable there because
of the corner. In this video, we related the
236:06 - graph of a function to the graph of its derivative.
By thinking about the slopes of tangent lines,
236:12 - we also looked at several ways that a derivative
can fail to exist at a point and noted that
236:18 - if a function is differentiable, it has to
be continuous. This video gives a proof that
236:27 - differentiable functions are continuous. What
we want to show here is that if a function
236:32 - is differentiable at a number x equals a,
then it's continuous at x equals a. Let me
236:40 - call the function f of x. And I'm going to
start out by writing down what it means for
236:44 - f of x to be differentiable at x equals a.
That means that the limit as x goes to a of
236:54 - f of x minus F of A over x minus a exists
and equals this finite number that we call
237:05 - f prime
237:06 - However, if all we know is that f is continuous
at x equals a, then we can't conclude anything
237:19 - about whether or not is differentiable there,
f may or may not be differentiable at x equals
237:27 - a. Remember the square root example, the square
root of x is continuous at x equals zero,
237:32 - but it's not differentiable there because
of the corner. In this video, we related the
237:35 - graph of a function to the graph of its derivative.
By thinking about the slopes of tangent lines,
237:40 - we also looked at several ways that a derivative
can fail to exist at a point and noted that
237:45 - if a function is differentiable, it has to
be continuous. This video gives a proof that
237:48 - differentiable functions are continuous. What
we want to show here is that if a function
237:56 - is differentiable at a number x equals a,
then it's continuous at x equals a. Let me
238:01 - call the function f of x. And I'm going to
start out by writing down what it means for
238:07 - f of x to be differentiable at x equals a.
That means that the limit as x goes to a of
238:14 - f of x minus F of A over x minus a exists
and equals this finite number that we call
238:23 - f prime
238:24 - of a. Now I'm going to multiply both sides
of this equation
238:25 - of a. Now I'm going to multiply both sides
of this equation
238:28 - by the limit as x goes to a of x minus a.
Now wait a second, before I go any further
238:33 - on to make sure this is legit. Does this limit
actually exist? Well, yeah, because the limit
238:37 - as x goes to a of x exists, that's just a,
and the limit as x goes to a of a exists,
238:45 - that's a also. So the limit of the difference
has to exist. And actually, that limit of
238:51 - the difference is the difference of the limits,
which is just going to be a minus a or a zero.
238:53 - So I've actually just multiplied both sides
by zero and a fancy form.
238:58 - by the limit as x goes to a of x minus a.
Now wait a second, before I go any further
239:03 - on to make sure this is legit. Does this limit
actually exist? Well, yeah, because the limit
239:10 - as x goes to a of x exists, that's just a,
and the limit as x goes to a of a exists,
239:17 - that's a also. So the limit of the difference
has to exist. And actually, that limit of
239:28 - the difference is the difference of the limits,
which is just going to be a minus a or a zero.
239:30 - So I've actually just multiplied both sides
by zero and a fancy form.
239:33 - This is actually a surprisingly useful thing
to do. Because I have a product of a limit
239:44 - of two limits here, both of which exist. So
by the product rule for limits, I can rewrite
239:48 - this as the limit as x goes to a
239:51 - This is actually a surprisingly useful thing
to do. Because I have a product of a limit
239:55 - of two limits here, both of which exist. So
by the product rule for limits, I can rewrite
240:01 - this as the limit as x goes to a
240:06 - of x minus a times f of x minus F of A over
x minus a. And canceling these two copies
240:15 - of x minus a, which is fine to do when x is
near a, just not when x equals a, I get that
240:27 - the limit of f of x minus f of a is equal
to this limit over here. Well, we said this
240:39 - limit was just zero. So my limit on the left
is equal to zero.
240:47 - of x minus a times f of x minus F of A over
x minus a. And canceling these two copies
240:54 - of x minus a, which is fine to do when x is
near a, just not when x equals a, I get that
241:04 - the limit of f of x minus f of a is equal
to this limit over here. Well, we said this
241:15 - limit was just zero. So my limit on the left
is equal to zero.
241:20 - And now I'm so close, I'd like to apply five
the limit rule to this difference to break
241:27 - it up into a difference of limits, but I can't
quite do that, because I'm not sure yet that
241:32 - the limit, as x goes to a of f of x exists,
that's sort of part of what I'm trying to
241:45 - prove as far as continuity. So instead, I
think I'm gonna add to both sides, a limit
241:52 - that I do know exists. And that's the limit
241:54 - And now I'm so close, I'd like to apply five
the limit rule to this difference to break
242:01 - it up into a difference of limits, but I can't
quite do that, because I'm not sure yet that
242:08 - the limit, as x goes to a of f of x exists,
that's sort of part of what I'm trying to
242:17 - prove as far as continuity. So instead, I
think I'm gonna add to both sides, a limit
242:23 - that I do know exists. And that's the limit
242:26 - of f of a.
242:27 - of f of a.
242:29 - Now, I do know that both of these two limits
on the left side exists, so I can use the
242:36 - limit rule about sums to rewrite this limit.
242:38 - Now, I do know that both of these two limits
on the left side exists, so I can use the
242:44 - limit rule about sums to rewrite this limit.
242:49 - Now, on the left side, I can cancel out my
copies of f of a, whatever number that is,
242:59 - and I get that the limit as x goes to a of
f of x which has to exist by the the limit
243:10 - rule for psalms that I applied
243:12 - Now, on the left side, I can cancel out my
copies of f of a, whatever number that is,
243:19 - and I get that the limit as x goes to a of
f of x which has to exist by the the limit
243:31 - rule for psalms that I applied
243:33 - above.
243:34 - above.
243:35 - That limit their past to equal the limit as
x goes to a of f of a, well, f of a is just
243:47 - some number, doesn't matter what X is doing
f of a is it's just f of a, whatever that
243:53 - is. So this limit on the right is just f of
a, and look at that. That's exactly what it
244:02 - means for a function to be continuous at x
equals a, the limit as x goes to a of f of
244:13 - x equals f of a. So f is continuous at x equals
a, hella proof is complete. In this video,
244:19 - we prove that if f is differentiable at x
equals a, then f is continuous at x equals
244:24 - a. This statement is equivalent to another
statement known in logic as its contrapositive,
244:28 - which says that if f is not continuous, at
x equals a, then f is not differentiable at
244:35 - x equals a. In this video, we'll learn a few
rules for calculating derivatives, namely,
244:42 - the power role, and the derivatives of sums,
differences and constant multiples. These
244:47 - rules will give us shortcuts for finding derivatives
quickly, without needing to resort to the
244:53 - old limit definition of derivative. In this
video, we'll only do statements of the rules
244:59 - and some examples, there won't be any proofs
or justification for why the rules hold. Instead,
245:06 - these proofs will be in a separate later video.
Let's start with some basics. First of all,
245:14 - if we have a constant C, and we will have
the function f of x equals C. So if I graph
245:30 - that, it's just going to be a straight horizontal
line.
245:34 - That limit their past to equal the limit as
x goes to a of f of a, well, f of a is just
245:42 - some number, doesn't matter what X is doing
f of a is it's just f of a, whatever that
245:48 - is. So this limit on the right is just f of
a, and look at that. That's exactly what it
245:58 - means for a function to be continuous at x
equals a, the limit as x goes to a of f of
246:11 - x equals f of a. So f is continuous at x equals
a, hella proof is complete. In this video,
246:21 - we prove that if f is differentiable at x
equals a, then f is continuous at x equals
246:30 - a. This statement is equivalent to another
statement known in logic as its contrapositive,
246:36 - which says that if f is not continuous, at
x equals a, then f is not differentiable at
246:44 - x equals a. In this video, we'll learn a few
rules for calculating derivatives, namely,
246:51 - the power role, and the derivatives of sums,
differences and constant multiples. These
246:55 - rules will give us shortcuts for finding derivatives
quickly, without needing to resort to the
247:01 - old limit definition of derivative. In this
video, we'll only do statements of the rules
247:09 - and some examples, there won't be any proofs
or justification for why the rules hold. Instead,
247:15 - these proofs will be in a separate later video.
Let's start with some basics. First of all,
247:22 - if we have a constant C, and we will have
the function f of x equals C. So if I graph
247:31 - that, it's just going to be a straight horizontal
line.
247:34 - So the derivative
247:35 - So the derivative
247:36 - df dx, ought to be zero, because the slope
of the tangent line of this straight line
247:44 - is just
247:45 - df dx, ought to be zero, because the slope
of the tangent line of this straight line
247:50 - is just
247:51 - zero.
247:52 - zero.
247:53 - Another simple example, is the derivative
of the function f of x equals x. So again,
248:04 - if I draw the graph, that's just going to
be a straight line with slope one. And so
248:13 - the tangent line for the straight line will
also have slope one. And the derivative, f
248:20 - prime of x has to be always equal to one.
These two simple examples are actually special
248:28 - cases of the power rule, which is one of the
most useful rules for calculating
248:36 - Another simple example, is the derivative
of the function f of x equals x. So again,
248:43 - if I draw the graph, that's just going to
be a straight line with slope one. And so
248:52 - the tangent line for the straight line will
also have slope one. And the derivative, f
248:56 - prime of x has to be always equal to one.
These two simple examples are actually special
249:03 - cases of the power rule, which is one of the
most useful rules for calculating
249:12 - derivatives.
249:13 - derivatives.
249:14 - So the power rule says that if you have the
function, y equals x to the n, where n is
249:20 - any real number, then you can find the derivative
d y dx, simply by pulling that exponent and
249:26 - down and multiplying it in the front and then
reducing the exponent by one. So for example,
249:36 - if you want to calculate the derivative of
y equals x to the 15th, D y dX here is just
249:48 - going to be 15 times x to the 15 minus one,
or 14. The second example, f of x equals the
249:55 - cube root of x might not immediately look
like an example where we can apply the power
250:02 - rule. But if we rewrite it, by putting the
cube root in exponential tation as x to the
250:09 - 1/3, now we can apply the power rule, we bring
the 1/3 down, multiplied on the front and
250:16 - So the power rule says that if you have the
function, y equals x to the n, where n is
250:25 - any real number, then you can find the derivative
d y dx, simply by pulling that exponent and
250:30 - down and multiplying it in the front and then
reducing the exponent by one. So for example,
250:40 - if you want to calculate the derivative of
y equals x to the 15th, D y dX here is just
250:47 - going to be 15 times x to the 15 minus one,
or 14. The second example, f of x equals the
250:53 - cube root of x might not immediately look
like an example where we can apply the power
251:00 - rule. But if we rewrite it, by putting the
cube root in exponential tation as x to the
251:05 - 1/3, now we can apply the power rule, we bring
the 1/3 down, multiplied on the front and
251:09 - reduce the
251:10 - reduce the
251:11 - exponent of 1/3 by one, or 1/3 minus one is
negative two thirds. So we found the derivative
251:19 - here using the power rule, we could rewrite
it if we want to using exponent rules, as
251:28 - one over 3x to the two thirds, either answers
good.
251:32 - exponent of 1/3 by one, or 1/3 minus one is
negative two thirds. So we found the derivative
251:42 - here using the power rule, we could rewrite
it if we want to using exponent rules, as
251:50 - one over 3x to the two thirds, either answers
good.
251:54 - In the third example, g of x is one over x
to the 3.7. Again, we need to do a little
252:03 - rewriting before we can apply the power rule.
So I'm going to rewrite g of x as x to the
252:10 - minus 3.7. Using exponent rules, now I can
find dg dx by pulling down the negative 3.7
252:17 - multiplying in the front, and now I have to
reduce negative 3.7 by one, so I subtract
252:24 - one that gives me x to the negative 4.7. Again,
I can rewrite this if I wish as negative 3.7
252:31 - over x to the 4.7. It's important to notice
that in all these examples and in fact, in
252:36 - any example where the power rule applies,
the variable x is in the base. And the exponent
252:41 - is just a constant, just a real number. The
constant multiple rules says that if c is
252:49 - just a constant real number, and f is a differentiable
function, then the derivative of C times f
252:57 - of x is just c times the derivative of f of
x. In other words, when we take the derivative,
253:07 - we can just pull a constant outside of the
derivative sign. Let's use this rule in an
253:16 - example. If we want to take the derivative
of 5x cubed, that's the same thing as five
253:27 - times the derivative of x cubed. And now using
the power rule, we can bring down the three
253:39 - and get 15x squared. f and g are differentiable
functions, then the derivative of f of x plus
253:51 - g of x is the derivative of f plus the derivative
of g. Similarly, for a difference, if f and
254:06 - g are differentiable functions, then the derivative
of the difference is just the difference of
254:13 - the derivatives. Now let's use all these rules
together to calculate the derivative of this
254:19 - polynomial. To find the y dx, we can use the
sum and difference rule to calculate the derivative
254:26 - of each term separately. Now using the constant
multiple rule and the power rule, we can bring
254:33 - out the seven, bring down the three getting
x squared here, similarly, for the next term,
254:39 - five times two times x to the one, four times
the derivative of x, which is just one, and
254:48 - the derivative of a constant two is just zero.
So simplifying, we get 21x squared minus 10x
254:54 - plus four, and notice that the derivative
of the original polynomial is just another
255:00 - polynomial of one less degree. In this video,
we use some shortcuts to calculate the derivatives
255:05 - of various functions, especially polynomials.
If you're interested in seeing where these
255:09 - rules come from, how they're derived from
the limit definition of derivative, then look
255:17 - for another video coming soon on proofs. This
video is about identities involving trig functions
255:24 - like sine and cosine. But I want to start
with some examples that just involve
255:32 - In the third example, g of x is one over x
to the 3.7. Again, we need to do a little
255:44 - rewriting before we can apply the power rule.
So I'm going to rewrite g of x as x to the
255:57 - minus 3.7. Using exponent rules, now I can
find dg dx by pulling down the negative 3.7
256:03 - multiplying in the front, and now I have to
reduce negative 3.7 by one, so I subtract
256:14 - one that gives me x to the negative 4.7. Again,
I can rewrite this if I wish as negative 3.7
256:23 - over x to the 4.7. It's important to notice
that in all these examples and in fact, in
256:32 - any example where the power rule applies,
the variable x is in the base. And the exponent
256:42 - is just a constant, just a real number. The
constant multiple rules says that if c is
256:48 - just a constant real number, and f is a differentiable
function, then the derivative of C times f
257:00 - of x is just c times the derivative of f of
x. In other words, when we take the derivative,
257:11 - we can just pull a constant outside of the
derivative sign. Let's use this rule in an
257:21 - example. If we want to take the derivative
of 5x cubed, that's the same thing as five
257:29 - times the derivative of x cubed. And now using
the power rule, we can bring down the three
257:36 - and get 15x squared. f and g are differentiable
functions, then the derivative of f of x plus
257:44 - g of x is the derivative of f plus the derivative
of g. Similarly, for a difference, if f and
257:55 - g are differentiable functions, then the derivative
of the difference is just the difference of
258:01 - the derivatives. Now let's use all these rules
together to calculate the derivative of this
258:10 - polynomial. To find the y dx, we can use the
sum and difference rule to calculate the derivative
258:17 - of each term separately. Now using the constant
multiple rule and the power rule, we can bring
258:27 - out the seven, bring down the three getting
x squared here, similarly, for the next term,
258:33 - five times two times x to the one, four times
the derivative of x, which is just one, and
258:41 - the derivative of a constant two is just zero.
So simplifying, we get 21x squared minus 10x
258:48 - plus four, and notice that the derivative
of the original polynomial is just another
258:50 - polynomial of one less degree. In this video,
we use some shortcuts to calculate the derivatives
258:56 - of various functions, especially polynomials.
If you're interested in seeing where these
259:02 - rules come from, how they're derived from
the limit definition of derivative, then look
259:10 - for another video coming soon on proofs. This
video is about identities involving trig functions
259:16 - like sine and cosine. But I want to start
with some examples that just involve
259:24 - quadratic functions. If I want to find the
solutions to this equation, I can rewrite
259:32 - it x squared minus 6x minus seven equals zero,
factor it, x minus seven times x plus one
259:41 - equals zero, set the factors equal to 0x minus
seven equals zero, or x plus one equals zero.
259:53 - And that gives me the solutions, x equals
seven, or x equals negative one. Next, let's
260:05 - look at this more complicated equation. I'm
going to try to solve that for x by multiplying
260:17 - out the right hand side. Next, our combined
terms on the right hand side. So that gives
260:27 - me x squared minus 6x on both sides, well,
x squared minus 6x is equal to x squared minus
260:38 - 6x. That's true no matter what I plug in for
x, and therefore, all values of x satisfy
260:46 - this equation, we can say that the solution
set is all real numbers. The second equation
260:54 - is called an identity, because it holds for
all values of the variable. The first equation,
261:01 - on the other hand is not an identity, because
it only holds for some values of x and not
261:14 - all values. Please pause the video for a moment
and try to decide which of the following three
261:21 - equations or identities that is, which of
these equations hold for all values of the
261:28 - variable. To start out, you might want to
test them by plugging in a few values of the
261:33 - variable and see if the equation holds. The
first equation is not an identity. It does
261:38 - hold for some values of x. For example, if
x equals zero, then sine of two times zero
261:43 - is zero. Two times sine of zero is also zero.
So it does hold when x is zero. However, when
261:51 - x is say pi over two, then sine of two times
pi over two, that's the same thing as sine
262:02 - of pi, which is zero, but two times sine of
pi over two, that's two times one, or two,
262:10 - and zero is not equal to two. So the equation
does not hold for x equals pi
262:18 - quadratic functions. If I want to find the
solutions to this equation, I can rewrite
262:23 - it x squared minus 6x minus seven equals zero,
factor it, x minus seven times x plus one
262:30 - equals zero, set the factors equal to 0x minus
seven equals zero, or x plus one equals zero.
262:36 - And that gives me the solutions, x equals
seven, or x equals negative one. Next, let's
262:42 - look at this more complicated equation. I'm
going to try to solve that for x by multiplying
262:48 - out the right hand side. Next, our combined
terms on the right hand side. So that gives
263:01 - me x squared minus 6x on both sides, well,
x squared minus 6x is equal to x squared minus
263:11 - 6x. That's true no matter what I plug in for
x, and therefore, all values of x satisfy
263:17 - this equation, we can say that the solution
set is all real numbers. The second equation
263:23 - is called an identity, because it holds for
all values of the variable. The first equation,
263:34 - on the other hand is not an identity, because
it only holds for some values of x and not
263:40 - all values. Please pause the video for a moment
and try to decide which of the following three
263:49 - equations or identities that is, which of
these equations hold for all values of the
263:57 - variable. To start out, you might want to
test them by plugging in a few values of the
264:07 - variable and see if the equation holds. The
first equation is not an identity. It does
264:15 - hold for some values of x. For example, if
x equals zero, then sine of two times zero
264:22 - is zero. Two times sine of zero is also zero.
So it does hold when x is zero. However, when
264:30 - x is say pi over two, then sine of two times
pi over two, that's the same thing as sine
264:36 - of pi, which is zero, but two times sine of
pi over two, that's two times one, or two,
264:47 - and zero is not equal to two. So the equation
does not hold for x equals pi
264:59 - over two.
265:00 - over two.
265:01 - Since it doesn't hold for all values of the
variable, it's not an identity. The second
265:09 - equation is an identity. You can build some
evidence for this by plugging in numbers.
265:17 - For example, cosine of zero plus pi, which
is negative one is the same thing as negative
265:24 - of cosine of zero. You can also check for
example, that cosine of pi over six plus pi
265:31 - is the same thing as negative cosine of pi
over six. But even if we check a zillion examples,
265:39 - that's just evidence, it's not a proof that
the identity holds, we could have just gotten
265:44 - lucky with the values we picked, we can build
a little bit stronger evidence, by looking
265:49 - at graphs, I'm going to put theta on the x
axis in a pie graph, y equals cosine of theta
265:55 - plus
265:56 - Since it doesn't hold for all values of the
variable, it's not an identity. The second
266:05 - equation is an identity. You can build some
evidence for this by plugging in numbers.
266:10 - For example, cosine of zero plus pi, which
is negative one is the same thing as negative
266:19 - of cosine of zero. You can also check for
example, that cosine of pi over six plus pi
266:27 - is the same thing as negative cosine of pi
over six. But even if we check a zillion examples,
266:35 - that's just evidence, it's not a proof that
the identity holds, we could have just gotten
266:44 - lucky with the values we picked, we can build
a little bit stronger evidence, by looking
266:53 - at graphs, I'm going to put theta on the x
axis in a pie graph, y equals cosine of theta
267:03 - plus
267:04 - pi,
267:05 - pi,
267:06 - that's just like the graph of cosine shifted
over to the left by pi. On the other hand,
267:14 - if I graph y equals negative cosine theta,
that's the graph of cosine theta, reflected
267:20 - across the x axis, which gives us the exact
same graph. So graphing both sides gives us
267:26 - strong evidence that this equation is an identity,
it holds for all values of theta. Now, the
267:32 - strongest evidence of all would be an algebraic
proof, which we'll do later in the course,
267:39 - once we have a formula for the cosine of a
sum of two angles.
267:41 - that's just like the graph of cosine shifted
over to the left by pi. On the other hand,
267:46 - if I graph y equals negative cosine theta,
that's the graph of cosine theta, reflected
267:50 - across the x axis, which gives us the exact
same graph. So graphing both sides gives us
267:54 - strong evidence that this equation is an identity,
it holds for all values of theta. Now, the
268:01 - strongest evidence of all would be an algebraic
proof, which we'll do later in the course,
268:08 - once we have a formula for the cosine of a
sum of two angles.
268:14 - In the meantime, let's look at equation C.
It turns out equation C is an identity. And
268:22 - we could build evidence for it again by plugging
in values for x, or by graphing the left side
268:26 - and the right side separately, and checking
to see that the graphs coincided. But for
268:32 - this example, I'm going to go ahead and do
an algebraic verification.
268:39 - In the meantime, let's look at equation C.
It turns out equation C is an identity. And
268:47 - we could build evidence for it again by plugging
in values for x, or by graphing the left side
268:52 - and the right side separately, and checking
to see that the graphs coincided. But for
268:58 - this example, I'm going to go ahead and do
an algebraic verification.
269:02 - In particular, I'm going to start with the
left side of the equation, and rewrite things
269:08 - and rewrite things until I get to the right
side of the equation. The first thing I'll
269:18 - rewrite
269:19 - In particular, I'm going to start with the
left side of the equation, and rewrite things
269:24 - and rewrite things until I get to the right
side of the equation. The first thing I'll
269:31 - rewrite
269:32 - is secant and tangent in terms of their constituent
functions, sine and cosine. Since secant of
269:44 - x is one over cosine x, and tangent of x is
sine x over cosine x, I can rewrite this expression
269:56 - as one over cosine x minus sine x times sine
x over cosine x. I can clean up those fractions
270:06 - and write this as one over cosine x minus
sine squared x over cosine x. Now, I noticed
270:18 - that I have two fractions with the same denominator.
So I can pull them together as one minus sine
270:30 - squared x over cosine x. Next, I'm going to
rewrite the numerator one minus sine squared
270:37 - x using the Pythagorean identity that says
that cosine squared x plus sine squared x
270:47 - equals one, and therefore, one minus sine
squared x is equal to cosine squared x just
270:58 - by subtracting sine squared x from both sides.
So I can replace my numerator, one minus sine
271:04 - squared x with cosine squared x. And canceling
one cosine from the top and from the bottom,
271:16 - that's the same thing as cosine of x, which
is the right hand side that I was trying to
271:29 - get to. So a combination of a bunch of algebra,
and the Pythagorean identity allows me to
271:41 - prove that this equation is true for all values
of x,
271:48 - is secant and tangent in terms of their constituent
functions, sine and cosine. Since secant of
271:57 - x is one over cosine x, and tangent of x is
sine x over cosine x, I can rewrite this expression
272:10 - as one over cosine x minus sine x times sine
x over cosine x. I can clean up those fractions
272:20 - and write this as one over cosine x minus
sine squared x over cosine x. Now, I noticed
272:25 - that I have two fractions with the same denominator.
So I can pull them together as one minus sine
272:35 - squared x over cosine x. Next, I'm going to
rewrite the numerator one minus sine squared
272:46 - x using the Pythagorean identity that says
that cosine squared x plus sine squared x
272:52 - equals one, and therefore, one minus sine
squared x is equal to cosine squared x just
273:01 - by subtracting sine squared x from both sides.
So I can replace my numerator, one minus sine
273:09 - squared x with cosine squared x. And canceling
one cosine from the top and from the bottom,
273:17 - that's the same thing as cosine of x, which
is the right hand side that I was trying to
273:25 - get to. So a combination of a bunch of algebra,
and the Pythagorean identity allows me to
273:34 - prove that this equation is true for all values
of x,
273:37 - it's an identity. The best way to prove that
an equation is an identity
273:42 - it's an identity. The best way to prove that
an equation is an identity
273:48 - is to use algebra and to use other identities,
like the Pythagorean identity to rewrite one
273:56 - side of the equation till it looks like the
other side. The best way to prove the net
274:07 - equation is not an identity is to plug in
numbers that break the identity. That is make
274:12 - the equation not true. Now if you're just
trying to decide if an equation has an identity
274:18 - or not, and not worried about proving it,
then I recommend plugging in numbers, or graphing
274:28 - the left and right sides to see if those graphs
are the same. Recall that an identity is an
274:32 - equation that holds for all values of the
variable. This video states and proves three
274:41 - identities called the Pythagorean identities.
The first one is the familiar cosine squared
274:48 - theta plus sine squared theta equals one.
The second one says tan squared theta plus
274:55 - one equals secant squared theta. And the third
one goes cotangent squared theta plus one
275:00 - equals cosecant squared theta. Let's start
by proving that cosine squared theta plus
275:05 - sine squared theta equals one. I'll do this
by drawing the unit circle with a right triangle
275:11 - inside it by the definition of sine and cosine,
the x&y coordinates of this top point, r cosine
275:18 - theta and sine theta, the high partners, my
triangle is one, since that's the radius of
275:25 - my unit circle. Now the length of the base
of my triangle is the same thing as the x
275:33 - coordinate of this point. So that's equal
to cosine theta. The height of this triangle
275:41 - is the same thing as the y coordinate of this
point. So that's sine theta. Now the Pythagoras
275:46 - theorem for right triangles, says this side
length squared plus that side length squared
275:52 - is equal to the hypothenar squared. So by
the Pythagorean theorem, we have that cosine
275:59 - theta squared plus sine theta squared equals
one squared, I can rewrite that as cosine
276:08 - squared theta plus sine squared theta equals
one, since one squared is one, and cosine
276:12 - squared theta is just a shorthand notation
for cosine theta squared. That completes the
276:19 - proof of the first Pythagorean identity, at
least in the case, when the angle theta is
276:27 - in the first quadrant. In the case, when the
angle was in a different quadrant, you can
276:33 - use symmetry to argue the same identity holds.
But I won't give the details here. To prove
276:40 - the next Pythagorean identity, tan squared
theta plus one equals secant squared theta,
276:45 - let's use the first without your an identity,
which said that cosine squared theta plus
276:51 - sine squared theta equals one, I'm going to
divide both sides of this equation by cosine
276:55 - squared theta. Now I'm going to rewrite the
left side by breaking apart the fraction into
276:59 - cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta
plus sine squared theta over cosine squared
277:05 - theta. Now cosine squared theta over cosine
squared theta is just one. And I can rewrite
277:12 - the next fraction as sine of theta over cosine
of theta squared. That's because when I square
277:18 - a fraction, I can just square the numerator
and square the denominator. And sine squared
277:23 - theta is shorthand for sine of theta squares.
Similarly, for cosine squared theta. Now on
277:27 - the other side of the equal sign, I can rewrite
this fraction as one over cosine theta squared.
277:34 - Again, that's because when I square the fraction,
I just get the one squared, which is one divided
277:43 - by the cosine theta squared, which is this.
I'm almost done. sine theta over cosine theta
277:49 - is the same thing as tangent theta. And one
over cosine theta is the same thing as secant
277:59 - theta. Using the shorthand notation, that
says one plus tan squared theta equals sequencer
278:07 - data, which, after rearranging is exactly
the identity that we were looking for. The
278:12 - proof of the third for that green identity
is very similar. Once again, I'll start with
278:26 - the identity
278:27 - is to use algebra and to use other identities,
like the Pythagorean identity to rewrite one
278:38 - side of the equation till it looks like the
other side. The best way to prove the net
278:46 - equation is not an identity is to plug in
numbers that break the identity. That is make
278:52 - the equation not true. Now if you're just
trying to decide if an equation has an identity
278:57 - or not, and not worried about proving it,
then I recommend plugging in numbers, or graphing
279:04 - the left and right sides to see if those graphs
are the same. Recall that an identity is an
279:13 - equation that holds for all values of the
variable. This video states and proves three
279:22 - identities called the Pythagorean identities.
The first one is the familiar cosine squared
279:28 - theta plus sine squared theta equals one.
The second one says tan squared theta plus
279:34 - one equals secant squared theta. And the third
one goes cotangent squared theta plus one
279:39 - equals cosecant squared theta. Let's start
by proving that cosine squared theta plus
279:45 - sine squared theta equals one. I'll do this
by drawing the unit circle with a right triangle
279:52 - inside it by the definition of sine and cosine,
the x&y coordinates of this top point, r cosine
279:59 - theta and sine theta, the high partners, my
triangle is one, since that's the radius of
280:03 - my unit circle. Now the length of the base
of my triangle is the same thing as the x
280:08 - coordinate of this point. So that's equal
to cosine theta. The height of this triangle
280:13 - is the same thing as the y coordinate of this
point. So that's sine theta. Now the Pythagoras
280:19 - theorem for right triangles, says this side
length squared plus that side length squared
280:23 - is equal to the hypothenar squared. So by
the Pythagorean theorem, we have that cosine
280:31 - theta squared plus sine theta squared equals
one squared, I can rewrite that as cosine
280:40 - squared theta plus sine squared theta equals
one, since one squared is one, and cosine
280:49 - squared theta is just a shorthand notation
for cosine theta squared. That completes the
280:56 - proof of the first Pythagorean identity, at
least in the case, when the angle theta is
281:03 - in the first quadrant. In the case, when the
angle was in a different quadrant, you can
281:06 - use symmetry to argue the same identity holds.
But I won't give the details here. To prove
281:11 - the next Pythagorean identity, tan squared
theta plus one equals secant squared theta,
281:18 - let's use the first without your an identity,
which said that cosine squared theta plus
281:26 - sine squared theta equals one, I'm going to
divide both sides of this equation by cosine
281:32 - squared theta. Now I'm going to rewrite the
left side by breaking apart the fraction into
281:37 - cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta
plus sine squared theta over cosine squared
281:44 - theta. Now cosine squared theta over cosine
squared theta is just one. And I can rewrite
281:53 - the next fraction as sine of theta over cosine
of theta squared. That's because when I square
282:02 - a fraction, I can just square the numerator
and square the denominator. And sine squared
282:08 - theta is shorthand for sine of theta squares.
Similarly, for cosine squared theta. Now on
282:15 - the other side of the equal sign, I can rewrite
this fraction as one over cosine theta squared.
282:20 - Again, that's because when I square the fraction,
I just get the one squared, which is one divided
282:26 - by the cosine theta squared, which is this.
I'm almost done. sine theta over cosine theta
282:35 - is the same thing as tangent theta. And one
over cosine theta is the same thing as secant
282:41 - theta. Using the shorthand notation, that
says one plus tan squared theta equals sequencer
282:45 - data, which, after rearranging is exactly
the identity that we were looking for. The
282:48 - proof of the third for that green identity
is very similar. Once again, I'll start with
282:55 - the identity
282:56 - cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta
equals one, and this time, I'll divide both
283:01 - sides by sine squared theta. I'll break up
the fraction on the left. And now I'll rewrite
283:07 - my fractions as cosine theta over sine theta
squared plus one equals one over sine theta
283:12 - squared. cosine over sine can be written As
cotangent, and one over sine can be written
283:18 - as cosecant. That gives me the identity that
I'm looking for. We've now proved three trig
283:25 - identities. The first one, we proved using
the unit circle, and the Pythagorean Theorem.
283:36 - The second and third identities, we proved
by using the first identity, and a bit of
283:44 - algebra. The sum and difference formulas are
formulas for computing the sine of a sum of
283:52 - two angles, the cosine of a sum of two angles,
the sine of a difference of two angles, and
283:59 - the cosine of a difference of two angles.
Please pause the video for a moment to think
284:05 - about this question. Is it true that the sine
of A plus B is equal to the sine of A plus
284:14 - the sine of B? No, it's not true. And we can
see by an example, if we plug in say, A equals
284:22 - pi over two and B equals pi, than the sine
of pi over two plus pi, is the same thing
284:30 - as a sine of three pi over two, which is negative
one. Whereas the sine of pi over two plus
284:38 - the sine of pi is equal to one plus zero,
which is one, negative one is not equal to
284:46 - one. So this equation does not hold for all
values of a and b. There are a few values
284:50 - of a and b for which it does hold. For example,
if a is zero, and B is zero, but it's not
284:56 - true in general, instead, we need more complicated
formulas. It turns out that the sine of the
285:03 - sum of two angles A plus B is given by sine
of A cosine of B plus cosine of A, sine of
285:20 - B. The cosine of A plus B is given by cosine
A cosine B minus sine A sine Bay. I like to
285:29 - remember these with a song, sine cosine cosine
sine cosine cosine minus sine sine. Please
285:36 - feel free to back up the video and sing along
with me, I encourage you to memorize the two
285:43 - formulas for the sine of a
285:46 - cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta
equals one, and this time, I'll divide both
285:51 - sides by sine squared theta. I'll break up
the fraction on the left. And now I'll rewrite
285:57 - my fractions as cosine theta over sine theta
squared plus one equals one over sine theta
286:05 - squared. cosine over sine can be written As
cotangent, and one over sine can be written
286:13 - as cosecant. That gives me the identity that
I'm looking for. We've now proved three trig
286:19 - identities. The first one, we proved using
the unit circle, and the Pythagorean Theorem.
286:23 - The second and third identities, we proved
by using the first identity, and a bit of
286:28 - algebra. The sum and difference formulas are
formulas for computing the sine of a sum of
286:34 - two angles, the cosine of a sum of two angles,
the sine of a difference of two angles, and
286:47 - the cosine of a difference of two angles.
Please pause the video for a moment to think
286:57 - about this question. Is it true that the sine
of A plus B is equal to the sine of A plus
287:06 - the sine of B? No, it's not true. And we can
see by an example, if we plug in say, A equals
287:16 - pi over two and B equals pi, than the sine
of pi over two plus pi, is the same thing
287:25 - as a sine of three pi over two, which is negative
one. Whereas the sine of pi over two plus
287:32 - the sine of pi is equal to one plus zero,
which is one, negative one is not equal to
287:39 - one. So this equation does not hold for all
values of a and b. There are a few values
287:43 - of a and b for which it does hold. For example,
if a is zero, and B is zero, but it's not
287:51 - true in general, instead, we need more complicated
formulas. It turns out that the sine of the
287:56 - sum of two angles A plus B is given by sine
of A cosine of B plus cosine of A, sine of
288:04 - B. The cosine of A plus B is given by cosine
A cosine B minus sine A sine Bay. I like to
288:17 - remember these with a song, sine cosine cosine
sine cosine cosine minus sine sine. Please
288:22 - feel free to back up the video and sing along
with me, I encourage you to memorize the two
289:34 - formulas for the sine of a
289:37 - sum of angles and the cosine of a sum of angles.
Once you do, it's easy to figure out the sine
289:43 - sum of angles and the cosine of a sum of angles.
Once you do, it's easy to figure out the sine
289:46 - and cosine of a difference of two angles.
One way to do this is to think of sine of
289:52 - and cosine of a difference of two angles.
One way to do this is to think of sine of
290:01 - A minus B as sine of A plus negative B. And
then use the angle sum formula. So this works
290:09 - out to sine cosine plus cosine, sine. And
now, if I use the fact that cosine is even,
290:25 - I know that cosine of negative B is cosine
of B. And since sine is odd, sine of negative
290:33 - b is negative sine of B. So I can rewrite
this as sine of A cosine of B minus cosine
290:39 - of A sine of B. Notice that this new formula
for the difference is the same as the formula
290:44 - for the sum is just that plus sign turned
into a minus sign. We can do the same trick
290:49 - for cosine of A minus B, that's cosine of
A plus minus b, which is cosine A cosine minus
290:57 - b minus sine of A sine of negative B. Again,
using even an odd properties, this gives us
291:08 - cosine A cosine B plus sine A sine B. Once
again, the formula for the difference is almost
291:19 - exactly like the for the song, just that minus
sign has switched to 
291:31 - a plus sign. Now let's use the angle sum formula
to find the exact value for the sign of 105
291:40 - degrees. Now, 105 degrees is not a special
angle on the unit circle, but I can write
291:48 - it as the sum of two special angles. I can
write it as 60 degrees plus 45 degrees. Therefore,
291:55 - the sine of 105 degrees is the sine of 60
plus 45. And now by the angle some formula,
292:04 - this is sine, cosine, cosine, sine. And I
for my Unit Circle, I can figure out that
292:13 - sine of 60 degrees is root three over two
cosine of 45 degrees root two over two, cosine
292:22 - of 60 degrees is one half, and sine of 45
degrees is root two over two. So this simplifies
292:31 - to root six plus root two over four. For our
last example, let's find the cosine of v plus
292:40 - W, given the values of cosine v and cosine
W, and the fact that v and w are angles in
292:49 - the first quadrant. Remember, to compute the
cosine of a sum, we can't just add together
292:53 - the two cosines. That wouldn't even make sense
in this case, because adding point nine and
292:59 - point seven would give something bigger than
one and the cosine of something's never bigger
293:05 - than one. Instead, we have to use the angle
sum formula for cosine. So that goes cosine
293:12 - of v plus w equals cosine, cosine, minus sine,
sine. Now, I've already know the cosine of
293:17 - v and the cosine of W, so I could just plug
those in. But I have to figure out the sine
293:21 - of v and the sine of W from the given information.
And one way to do that is to draw right triangles.
293:30 - So here, I'm going to draw a right triangle
with angle V,
293:34 - A minus B as sine of A plus negative B. And
then use the angle sum formula. So this works
293:43 - out to sine cosine plus cosine, sine. And
now, if I use the fact that cosine is even,
293:51 - I know that cosine of negative B is cosine
of B. And since sine is odd, sine of negative
293:58 - b is negative sine of B. So I can rewrite
this as sine of A cosine of B minus cosine
294:03 - of A sine of B. Notice that this new formula
for the difference is the same as the formula
295:34 - for the sum is just that plus sign turned
into a minus sign. We can do the same trick
295:42 - for cosine of A minus B, that's cosine of
A plus minus b, which is cosine A cosine minus
295:49 - b minus sine of A sine of negative B. Again,
using even an odd properties, this gives us
295:59 - cosine A cosine B plus sine A sine B. Once
again, the formula for the difference is almost
296:10 - exactly like the for the song, just that minus
sign has switched to a plus sign. Now let's
296:19 - use the angle sum formula to find the exact
value for the sign of 105 degrees. Now, 105
296:25 - degrees is not a special angle on the unit
circle, but I can write it as the sum of two
296:34 - special angles. I can write it as 60 degrees
plus 45 degrees. Therefore, the sine of 105
296:40 - degrees is the sine of 60 plus 45. And now
by the angle some formula, this is sine, cosine,
296:44 - cosine, sine. And I for my Unit Circle, I
can figure out that sine of 60 degrees is
296:53 - root three over two cosine of 45 degrees root
two over two, cosine of 60 degrees is one
296:59 - half, and sine of 45 degrees is root two over
two. So this simplifies to root six plus root
297:08 - two over four. For our last example, let's
find the cosine of v plus W, given the values
297:16 - of cosine v and cosine W, and the fact that
v and w are angles in the first quadrant.
297:22 - Remember, to compute the cosine of a sum,
we can't just add together the two cosines.
297:25 - That wouldn't even make sense in this case,
because adding point nine and point seven
297:30 - would give something bigger than one and the
cosine of something's never bigger than one.
297:35 - Instead, we have to use the angle sum formula
for cosine. So that goes cosine of v plus
297:44 - w equals cosine, cosine, minus sine, sine.
Now, I've already know the cosine of v and
297:50 - the cosine of W, so I could just plug those
in. But I have to figure out the sine of v
298:01 - and the sine of W from the given information.
And one way to do that is to draw right triangles.
298:08 - So here, I'm going to draw a right triangle
with angle V,
298:13 - and another right triangle with angle W. Since
I know that the cosine of V is point nine,
298:19 - I can think of that as nine over 10.
298:21 - and another right triangle with angle W. Since
I know that the cosine of V is point nine,
298:27 - I can think of that as nine over 10.
298:30 - And I can think of that as adjacent over hypotenuse
in my right triangle. So I'll decorate my
298:42 - triangles adjacent side with the number nine
and the hypotenuse with 10. Similarly, since
298:49 - I know that the cosine of W is point seven,
which is seven tenths, I can put a seven on
298:58 - this adjacent side, and a 10 on this iPod
news. Now, the Pythagorean Theorem, lets me
299:06 - compute the length of the unlabeled side.
So this one is going to be the square root
299:19 - of 10 squared minus nine squared, that's going
to be the square root of 19. And here I have
299:28 - the square root of 10 squared minus seven
squared. So that's the square root of 51.
299:33 - I can now find the sign of V as the opposite
over the hi partners. So that's the square
299:43 - root of 19 over 10. And the sign of W will
be the square root of 51 over 10. Because
299:59 - we're assuming v and w are in the first quadrant,
we know the values of sign need to be positive,
300:11 - so we don't need to Jimmy around with positive
or negative signs in our answers, we can just
300:27 - leave them as is.
300:31 - And I can think of that as adjacent over hypotenuse
in my right triangle. So I'll decorate my
300:42 - triangles adjacent side with the number nine
and the hypotenuse with 10. Similarly, since
300:49 - I know that the cosine of W is point seven,
which is seven tenths, I can put a seven on
300:59 - this adjacent side, and a 10 on this iPod
news. Now, the Pythagorean Theorem, lets me
301:11 - compute the length of the unlabeled side.
So this one is going to be the square root
301:24 - of 10 squared minus nine squared, that's going
to be the square root of 19. And here I have
301:32 - the square root of 10 squared minus seven
squared. So that's the square root of 51.
301:40 - I can now find the sign of V as the opposite
over the hi partners. So that's the square
301:49 - root of 19 over 10. And the sign of W will
be the square root of 51 over 10. Because
301:59 - we're assuming v and w are in the first quadrant,
we know the values of sign need to be positive,
302:05 - so we don't need to Jimmy around with positive
or negative signs in our answers, we can just
302:12 - leave them as is.
302:14 - Now we're ready to plug into our formula.
So we have that cosine of v plus w is equal
302:23 - to point nine times point seven minus the
square root of 19 over 10, times the square
302:27 - root of 51 over 10.
302:29 - Now we're ready to plug into our formula.
So we have that cosine of v plus w is equal
302:34 - to point nine times point seven minus the
square root of 19 over 10, times the square
302:41 - root of 51 over 10.
302:44 - using a calculator, this works out to a decimal
approximation of 0.3187. This video gave the
302:49 - angle sum and difference formulas and use
them to compute some values. To see a proof
302:54 - for why the sum formulas hold, please watch
my other video. This video gives formulas
302:59 - for sine of two theta and cosine of two theta.
Please pause the video for a moment and see
303:06 - if you think this equation sine of two theta
equals two sine theta is true or false. Remember
303:10 - that true means always true for all values
of theta were false means sometimes they're
303:20 - always false. This equation is false, because
it's not true for all values of theta. One
303:28 - way to see this is graphically, if I graph
y equals sine of two theta, that's like the
303:33 - graph of sine theta, squished in horizontally
by a factor of one half. On the other hand,
303:41 - if I graph y equals two sine beta, that's
like the graph of sine theta stretched vertically
303:50 - by a factor of two. These two graphs are not
the same. So instead, we need a more complicated
303:58 - formula for sine of two theta. And that formula
is sine of two theta is two sine theta, cosine
304:07 - theta. It's not hard to see why that formula
works based on the angle some formula. Recall
304:19 - that sine of A plus B is equal to sine A cosine
B plus cosine A sign Therefore, sine of two
304:33 - theta, which is sine of theta plus theta is
going to be sine theta, cosine theta, plus
304:40 - cosine theta sine theta. simply plugging in
theta for a and theta for B, in this angle,
304:48 - some formula, will sine theta cosine theta
is the same thing as cosine theta sine theta.
304:54 - So I can rewrite this as twice sine theta
cosine theta. That gives me this formula.
305:00 - There's also a formula for cosine of two theta.
And that formula is cosine squared theta minus
305:11 - sine squared theta. Again, we can use the
angle sum formula to see where this comes
305:17 - from. cosine of A plus B is equal to cosine
of A cosine of B minus sine A, sine B. So
305:27 - if we want cosine of two theta, that's just
cosine of theta plus theta, which is cosine
305:32 - theta, cosine theta, minus sine theta, sine
theta by plugging in beta for a and b, this
305:41 - can be rewritten as cosine squared theta minus
sine squared theta, which is exactly the formula
305:50 - above. Now there are a couple other formulas
for cosine of two theta that are also popular.
305:57 - One of them is one minus two sine squared
theta. And the other one is cosine of two
306:06 - theta is two cosine squared theta minus one,
you can get each of these two formulas from
306:15 - the original one using the Pythagorean identity.
We know that cosine squared theta plus sine
306:21 - squared theta is one. So cosine squared theta
is one minus sine squared theta. If I plug
306:26 - that into my original formula, which I've
copied here, so I'm plugging in, instead of
306:31 - cosine squared, I'm gonna write one minus
sine squared theta, I still have a nother
306:39 - minus sine squared theta. So that's the same
thing as one minus twice science grid data,
306:46 - which is exactly what I'm looking for. Similarly,
I can use the Pythagorean identity to write
306:51 - sine squared theta as one minus cosine squared
theta. Again, I'll take this equation and
307:00 - copy it below. But this time, I'm going to
plug in for sine squared right here. So that
307:07 - gives me cosine of two theta is cosine squared
theta minus the quantity one minus cosine
307:18 - squared theta. That simplifies to two cosine
squared theta minus one after distributing
307:27 - the negative sign and combining like terms.
307:29 - using a calculator, this works out to a decimal
approximation of 0.3187. This video gave the
307:35 - angle sum and difference formulas and use
them to compute some values. To see a proof
307:45 - for why the sum formulas hold, please watch
my other video. This video gives formulas
307:55 - for sine of two theta and cosine of two theta.
Please pause the video for a moment and see
308:04 - if you think this equation sine of two theta
equals two sine theta is true or false. Remember
308:11 - that true means always true for all values
of theta were false means sometimes they're
308:17 - always false. This equation is false, because
it's not true for all values of theta. One
308:29 - way to see this is graphically, if I graph
y equals sine of two theta, that's like the
308:42 - graph of sine theta, squished in horizontally
by a factor of one half. On the other hand,
308:53 - if I graph y equals two sine beta, that's
like the graph of sine theta stretched vertically
309:04 - by a factor of two. These two graphs are not
the same. So instead, we need a more complicated
309:23 - formula for sine of two theta. And that formula
is sine of two theta is two sine theta, cosine
309:37 - theta. It's not hard to see why that formula
works based on the angle some formula. Recall
309:46 - that sine of A plus B is equal to sine A cosine
B plus cosine A sign Therefore, sine of two
309:53 - theta, which is sine of theta plus theta is
going to be sine theta, cosine theta, plus
310:04 - cosine theta sine theta. simply plugging in
theta for a and theta for B, in this angle,
310:15 - some formula, will sine theta cosine theta
is the same thing as cosine theta sine theta.
310:22 - So I can rewrite this as twice sine theta
cosine theta. That gives me this formula.
310:27 - There's also a formula for cosine of two theta.
And that formula is cosine squared theta minus
310:33 - sine squared theta. Again, we can use the
angle sum formula to see where this comes
310:41 - from. cosine of A plus B is equal to cosine
of A cosine of B minus sine A, sine B. So
310:48 - if we want cosine of two theta, that's just
cosine of theta plus theta, which is cosine
310:57 - theta, cosine theta, minus sine theta, sine
theta by plugging in beta for a and b, this
311:03 - can be rewritten as cosine squared theta minus
sine squared theta, which is exactly the formula
311:13 - above. Now there are a couple other formulas
for cosine of two theta that are also popular.
311:18 - One of them is one minus two sine squared
theta. And the other one is cosine of two
311:24 - theta is two cosine squared theta minus one,
you can get each of these two formulas from
311:27 - the original one using the Pythagorean identity.
We know that cosine squared theta plus sine
311:30 - squared theta is one. So cosine squared theta
is one minus sine squared theta. If I plug
311:36 - that into my original formula, which I've
copied here, so I'm plugging in, instead of
311:40 - cosine squared, I'm gonna write one minus
sine squared theta, I still have a nother
311:43 - minus sine squared theta. So that's the same
thing as one minus twice science grid data,
311:46 - which is exactly what I'm looking for. Similarly,
I can use the Pythagorean identity to write
311:49 - sine squared theta as one minus cosine squared
theta. Again, I'll take this equation and
311:55 - copy it below. But this time, I'm going to
plug in for sine squared right here. So that
312:03 - gives me cosine of two theta is cosine squared
theta minus the quantity one minus cosine
312:07 - squared theta. That simplifies to two cosine
squared theta minus one after distributing
312:12 - the negative sign and combining like terms.
312:15 - So I have one double angle formula for sine
of two theta. And I have three versions of
312:26 - the double angle formula for cosine of two
theta.
312:30 - So I have one double angle formula for sine
of two theta. And I have three versions of
312:40 - the double angle formula for cosine of two
theta.
312:44 - Now let's use these formulas in some examples.
Let's find the cosine of two theta. If we
312:52 - know that cosine theta is negative one over
root 10, and theta terminates in quadrant
313:02 - three, we have a choice of three formulas
for cosine of two theta, I'm going to choose
313:14 - the second one, because it only involves cosine
if they had on the right side. And they already
313:20 - know my value for cosine theta. Of course,
I could use one of the other ones,
313:26 - Now let's use these formulas in some examples.
Let's find the cosine of two theta. If we
313:32 - know that cosine theta is negative one over
root 10, and theta terminates in quadrant
313:37 - three, we have a choice of three formulas
for cosine of two theta, I'm going to choose
313:43 - the second one, because it only involves cosine
if they had on the right side. And they already
313:50 - know my value for cosine theta. Of course,
I could use one of the other ones,
313:53 - but then I'd have to work out the value of
sine theta. So plugging in, I get cosine of
313:56 - two theta is twice negative one over root
n squared minus one, which simplifies to two
314:03 - tenths minus one or negative eight tenths,
negative four fifths. Finally, let's solve
314:09 - the equation two cosine x plus sine of 2x
equals zero. What makes this equation tricky
314:16 - is that one of the trig functions has the
argument of just x, but the other tree function
314:22 - has the argument of 2x. So I want to use my
double angle formula to rewrite sine of 2x.
314:29 - I'll copy down the two cosine x, and now sine
of 2x is equal to two sine x cosine x. At
314:43 - this point, I see a way to factor my equation,
I can factor out a two cosine x from both
314:57 - of these two terms. That gives me one plus
sine x and the product there is equal to zero.
315:07 - That means that either two cosine x is equal
to zero One plus sine x is equal to zero,
315:15 - that simplifies to cosine x equals zero, or
sine x is negative one. Using my unit circle,
315:27 - I see that cosine of x is zero at pi over
two, and three pi over two, while sine of
315:38 - x is negative one at three pi over two, there's
some redundancy here, but my solution set
315:47 - is going to be pi over two plus multiples
of two pi, and three pi over two plus multiples
315:55 - of two pi. This video proved the double angle
formulas, sine of two theta is two sine theta
316:01 - cosine theta. and cosine of two theta is cosine
squared theta minus sine squared theta. It
316:09 - also proved to alternate versions of the equation
for cosine of two theta. This video introduces
316:18 - higher order derivatives and notation. We've
seen that f prime of x denotes the derivative
316:24 - of the function f of x, but f prime of x is
also itself a function. So we can take its
316:34 - derivative, that would be f prime prime of
x, which is usually written instead as f double
316:45 - prime of x. This is called the second derivative
of f. And it means the derivative of the derivative,
316:50 - we can also talk about the third derivative,
f triple prime of x, which might sometimes
316:57 - be written f to the three of x if you get
tired of writing all those primes, and we
317:04 - can talk about the nth derivative f, parentheses
n of x, the parentheses here are important
317:09 - to show that it's the nth derivative. The
second, third and nth derivative are referred
317:15 - to as higher order
317:16 - but then I'd have to work out the value of
sine theta. So plugging in, I get cosine of
317:21 - two theta is twice negative one over root
n squared minus one, which simplifies to two
317:25 - tenths minus one or negative eight tenths,
negative four fifths. Finally, let's solve
317:29 - the equation two cosine x plus sine of 2x
equals zero. What makes this equation tricky
317:36 - is that one of the trig functions has the
argument of just x, but the other tree function
317:41 - has the argument of 2x. So I want to use my
double angle formula to rewrite sine of 2x.
317:52 - I'll copy down the two cosine x, and now sine
of 2x is equal to two sine x cosine x. At
318:03 - this point, I see a way to factor my equation,
I can factor out a two cosine x from both
318:16 - of these two terms. That gives me one plus
sine x and the product there is equal to zero.
318:25 - That means that either two cosine x is equal
to zero One plus sine x is equal to zero,
318:40 - that simplifies to cosine x equals zero, or
sine x is negative one. Using my unit circle,
318:48 - I see that cosine of x is zero at pi over
two, and three pi over two, while sine of
318:57 - x is negative one at three pi over two, there's
some redundancy here, but my solution set
319:05 - is going to be pi over two plus multiples
of two pi, and three pi over two plus multiples
319:14 - of two pi. This video proved the double angle
formulas, sine of two theta is two sine theta
319:19 - cosine theta. and cosine of two theta is cosine
squared theta minus sine squared theta. It
319:27 - also proved to alternate versions of the equation
for cosine of two theta. This video introduces
319:34 - higher order derivatives and notation. We've

319:56 - prime of x. This is called the second derivative
of f. And it means the derivative of the derivative,

n of x, the parentheses here are important
320:24 - to show that it's the nth derivative. The
second, third and nth derivative are referred
320:30 - to as higher order
320:32 - derivatives.
320:33 - derivatives.
320:34 - There are many alternative notations for derivatives
stemming from their tangled and contentious
320:38 - history in the 1600s. There are a few different
notations for functions themselves. Most often
320:42 - we write a function of something like f of
x, but we can also use the variable y to refer
320:50 - to the output of a function. When we're looking
at the first derivative. We've been using
320:53 - the notation f prime of x. But you might also
see y prime, this means the same thing. Another
321:01 - notation is df dx, is known as lug nuts denotation.
After five minutes, you might see something
321:09 - like dy dx of f of x. And you might see dy
dx, another version of Lebanon's notation.
321:14 - Sometimes you'll also see a capital D used
to refer to the derivative. If we're looking
321:16 - at the second derivative, we've seen that
in Haitian f double prime of x, y double prime
321:19 - is a similar notation, or we might write dy
dx of df

322:23 - dx.
322:24 - dx.
322:25 - And the shorthand for that is d squared f
dx squared. Similarly, we might write d squared
322:34 - y dx squared using y in the place of F for
the function.
322:41 - And the shorthand for that is d squared f
dx squared. Similarly, we might write d squared
322:48 - y dx squared using y in the place of F for
the function.
322:53 - There's similar notations for third derivative,
I'll jump ahead to nth derivatives. So that
322:57 - would be F to the n of x, or y to the n, d
to the n of f dx to the n, or D to the n of
323:07 - y dx to the N. When using live minutes notation,
we want to emphasize that we're evaluating
323:14 - our derivative at a particular value of x,
we might write something like at x equals
323:24 - three, or at x equals a, using a vertical
line. For better or for worse, you'll need
323:30 - to become familiar with all of these alternative
notations.

324:13 - That's all for this video on higher order
derivatives and notation. This video is about
324:19 - the derivative of e to the x, one of my favorite
functions ever simply because it has such
324:27 - a great derivative. As you may recall, he
is an irrational number whose decimal approximation
324:32 - is something like 2.718 looks like it's repeating.
But then it keeps going on forever, never
324:38 - repeating never terminating.
324:40 - That's all for this video on higher order
derivatives and notation. This video is about
324:48 - the derivative of e to the x, one of my favorite
functions ever simply because it has such
324:54 - a great derivative. As you may recall, he
is an irrational number whose decimal approximation
325:00 - is something like 2.718 looks like it's repeating.
But then it keeps going on forever, never
325:09 - repeating never terminating.
325:11 - Its value notice is somewhere in between two
and three. Here is a graph of y equals e to
325:18 - the x.
325:19 - Its value notice is somewhere in between two
and three. Here is a graph of y equals e to
325:28 - the x.
325:29 - It says exponential function increase thing
looks a lot like two to the x or three to
325:37 - the x, not only is the graph of e to the x
increasing, but it's increasing more and more
325:46 - rapidly. So for negative values of x, the
slope of this graph is positive but very close
325:55 - to zero. Over here, when x equals zero, that
slope is looks like approximately a slope
326:03 - of one, we'll see that it is in fact exactly
one. And as the x values increase, this tangent
326:09 - lines get steeper and steeper. I'm going to
state without proof, three really useful facts
326:12 - about E. First, if you take the limit, as
n goes to infinity of one plus one over N
326:18 - raised to the nth power, that limit exists
and equals E, you might have seen something
326:23 - like that when you took precalculus, and looked
at compound interest compounded over smaller
326:29 - and smaller time periods. But even if you
haven't seen it before, it's a really important
326:35 - fact worth memorizing, you'll see it again
later in the class. A second important formula
326:41 - is that the limit as h goes to zero of e to
the H minus one over h equals one. Now this
326:49 - expression here on the left may remind you
of a derivative, in fact, I can rewrite it
326:54 - as the limit as h goes to zero of e to the
zero plus h minus e to the zero since either
327:02 - the zero is one over h, that's equal to one.
And this expression right here on the left
327:11 - is just the derivative of e to the x at x
equals zero, according to the limit definition
327:14 - of derivative. So this fact, is really saying
that the derivative of e to the x at x equals
327:18 - zero, that derivative is equal to one. So
for the third fat,
327:22 - It says exponential function increase thing
looks a lot like two to the x or three to
327:28 - the x, not only is the graph of e to the x
increasing, but it's increasing more and more
327:35 - rapidly. So for negative values of x, the
slope of this graph is positive but very close
327:41 - to zero. Over here, when x equals zero, that
slope is looks like approximately a slope
327:48 - of one, we'll see that it is in fact exactly
one. And as the x values increase, this tangent
328:00 - lines get steeper and steeper. I'm going to
state without proof, three really useful facts
328:05 - about E. First, if you take the limit, as
n goes to infinity of one plus one over N
328:10 - raised to the nth power, that limit exists
and equals E, you might have seen something
328:15 - like that when you took precalculus, and looked
at compound interest compounded over smaller
328:19 - and smaller time periods. But even if you
haven't seen it before, it's a really important
328:25 - fact worth memorizing, you'll see it again
later in the class. A second important formula
328:33 - is that the limit as h goes to zero of e to
the H minus one over h equals one. Now this
328:38 - expression here on the left may remind you
of a derivative, in fact, I can rewrite it
328:43 - as the limit as h goes to zero of e to the
zero plus h minus e to the zero since either
328:52 - the zero is one over h, that's equal to one.
And this expression right here on the left
329:00 - is just the derivative of e to the x at x
equals zero, according to the limit definition
329:08 - of derivative. So this fact, is really saying
that the derivative of e to the x at x equals
329:18 - zero, that derivative is equal to one. So
for the third fat,
329:24 - the third fact,
329:26 - the third fact,
329:28 - it talks about the derivative of e to the
x in general. And that third fact is that
329:38 - the derivative of the function, either the
X is the function, e to the x, e to the x
329:55 - is its own derivative. So this is a generalized
version of the second fact. Because the second
330:00 - fact is saying that the derivative at x equals
zero is one, well, one is just the same thing
330:07 - as e to the zero. So it saying the drought
of either the exit at x equals zero is equal
330:14 - to zero. And in general, the derivative of
e to the x at any x is just e to the x. Now,
330:20 - fact, one is frequently taken as the definition
of E. Sometimes fact two instead is taken
330:21 - as a definition of he, since he is the unique
number with this, this property, the unique
330:26 - number, you can plug in here and get this
limit equal one, it's possible to prove that
330:34 - fact one implies fact two and vice versa.
But I won't do that here. It's also possible
330:41 - to prove that fact two implies fact three
about the derivative in general. And that's
330:46 - pretty straightforward from the definition
of derivative. So I will show you that argument.
330:52 - So let's start out assuming fact to and try
to prove fact three using the definition of
330:56 - direct by the definition of derivative. The
derivative of e to the x is the limit as h
331:03 - goes to zero of e to the x plus h minus e
to the x over h. If I factor out an E to the
331:15 - X, from both terms on the numerator, I get
the limit of e to the x times e to the H minus
331:23 - one over h. Notice that e to the x times e
to the H is in the x plus h by the exponent
331:33 - rules. Now, either the X has nothing to do
with H, so it's just a constant as far as
331:44 - H is concerned. And I can pull it all the
way out of the limit sign and rewrite this
331:49 - limit. Now by factor two, which I'm assuming
this limit here is just one, which means that
331:57 - my derivative
331:58 - it talks about the derivative of e to the
x in general. And that third fact is that
332:03 - the derivative of the function, either the
X is the function, e to the x, e to the x
332:11 - is its own derivative. So this is a generalized
version of the second fact. Because the second
332:18 - fact is saying that the derivative at x equals
zero is one, well, one is just the same thing
332:24 - as e to the zero. So it saying the drought
of either the exit at x equals zero is equal
332:31 - to zero. And in general, the derivative of
e to the x at any x is just e to the x. Now,
332:40 - fact, one is frequently taken as the definition
of E. Sometimes fact two instead is taken
332:44 - as a definition of he, since he is the unique
number with this, this property, the unique
332:50 - number, you can plug in here and get this
limit equal one, it's possible to prove that
333:02 - fact one implies fact two and vice versa.
But I won't do that here. It's also possible
333:12 - to prove that fact two implies fact three
about the derivative in general. And that's
333:21 - pretty straightforward from the definition
of derivative. So I will show you that argument.
333:29 - So let's start out assuming fact to and try
to prove fact three using the definition of
333:36 - direct by the definition of derivative. The
derivative of e to the x is the limit as h
333:47 - goes to zero of e to the x plus h minus e
to the x over h. If I factor out an E to the
333:58 - X, from both terms on the numerator, I get
the limit of e to the x times e to the H minus
334:08 - one over h. Notice that e to the x times e
to the H is in the x plus h by the exponent
334:16 - rules. Now, either the X has nothing to do
with H, so it's just a constant as far as
334:24 - H is concerned. And I can pull it all the
way out of the limit sign and rewrite this
334:34 - limit. Now by factor two, which I'm assuming
this limit here is just one, which means that
334:42 - my derivative
334:43 - is e to the x, just like I wanted to show.
Here's a slightly tricky example, asking you
334:50 - to compute the derivative of a function that
involves lots of ears and X's
334:56 - is e to the x, just like I wanted to show.
Here's a slightly tricky example, asking you
335:06 - to compute the derivative of a function that
involves lots of ears and X's
335:13 - combined in lots of different ways. You'll
need to use not only the rule for the derivative
335:20 - of e to the x that we just talked about, but
also the power rule and other rules. derivatives
335:30 - that we've talked about
335:32 - combined in lots of different ways. You'll
need to use not only the rule for the derivative
335:41 - of e to the x that we just talked about, but
also the power rule and other rules. derivatives
335:50 - that we've talked about
335:52 - earlier.
335:53 - earlier.
335:54 - So please pause the video and try to compute
this derivative yourself paying careful attention
335:59 - to what's a variable and what's the constant.
336:03 - So please pause the video and try to compute
this derivative yourself paying careful attention
336:09 - to what's a variable and what's the constant.
336:13 - Okay, so we're taking the derivative here
with respect to x, that's our variable. And
336:20 - I'm taking the derivative of this entire expression,
which I can split up as a sum of derivatives.
336:27 - For the first term, I can just use the power
rule, E is a constant coefficient, so I just
336:34 - need to take down the exponent of two multiplied
on the front, times x to the One Power. Now
336:44 - for the second part,
336:46 - Okay, so we're taking the derivative here
with respect to x, that's our variable. And
336:54 - I'm taking the derivative of this entire expression,
which I can split up as a sum of derivatives.
337:05 - For the first term, I can just use the power
rule, E is a constant coefficient, so I just
337:15 - need to take down the exponent of two multiplied
on the front, times x to the One Power. Now
337:24 - for the second part,
337:26 - here, I do have my either the x function multiplied
by two, so its derivative is just two times
337:32 - the derivative of e to the x, which is either
the X
337:38 - here, I do have my either the x function multiplied
by two, so its derivative is just two times
337:45 - the derivative of e to the x, which is either
the X
337:51 - for my third part, I have just x times a constant
e squared. So the derivative of x is one times
338:00 - that constant. And so I just get e squared.
Finally, to take the derivative of x to the
338:07 - power of E squared, I can use the power rule
because my variable is in the base, and I
338:12 - have a constant e squared in my exponent.
So using the power rule, I bring down the
338:16 - E squared times that by x and subtract one
from the exponent. This video states the happy
338:23 - fact that the derivative of e to the x is
just e to
338:28 - for my third part, I have just x times a constant
e squared. So the derivative of x is one times
338:53 - that constant. And so I just get e squared.
Finally, to take the derivative of x to the
339:03 - power of E squared, I can use the power rule
because my variable is in the base, and I
339:10 - have a constant e squared in my exponent.
So using the power rule, I bring down the
339:13 - E squared times that by x and subtract one
from the exponent. This video states the happy
339:21 - fact that the derivative of e to the x is
just e to
339:30 - the x. This video prove some of the rules
for taking derivatives.
339:34 - the x. This video prove some of the rules
for taking derivatives.
339:37 - First, the constant row, it makes sense that
the derivative of a constant real number has
339:41 - to be zero, because the slope of a horizontal
line
339:45 - First, the constant row, it makes sense that
the derivative of a constant real number has
339:55 - to be zero, because the slope of a horizontal
line
340:00 - is zero.
340:01 - is zero.
340:02 - But we can also prove this fact, using the
limit definition of derivative. The derivative
340:08 - of any function is the limit as h goes to
zero of the function of x plus h minus the
340:17 - function at x divided by H. Well, here, our
function is just a constant. So we're taking
340:25 - the limit as h goes to zero of the constant
minus the constant divided by h, which is
340:33 - just the limit as h goes to zero of zero over
h, which is just the limit of zero, which
340:43 - is zero. Intuitively, it also makes sense
that the derivative of the function y equals
340:52 - x is got to be one, because the graph of y
equals x is a straight line with slope one.
341:03 - But again, we can prove this using the limit
definition of derivative. So the derivative
341:06 - of x is the limit as h goes to zero of x plus
h minus x over h. Well, that simplifies to
341:17 - the limit of h over h, since the Xs can't
So in other words, the limit as h goes to
341:23 - zero of one, which is one as wanted
341:28 - But we can also prove this fact, using the
limit definition of derivative. The derivative
341:35 - of any function is the limit as h goes to
zero of 
341:48 - the function of x plus h minus the function
at x divided by H. Well, here, our function
341:59 - is just a constant. So we're taking the limit
as h goes to zero of the constant minus the
342:09 - constant divided by h, which is just the limit
as h goes to zero of zero over h, which is
344:26 - just the limit of zero, which is zero. Intuitively,
it also makes sense that the derivative of
344:33 - the function y equals x is got to be one,
because the graph of y equals x is a straight
344:41 - line with slope one. But again, we can prove
this using the limit definition of derivative.
344:46 - So the derivative of x is the limit as h goes
to zero of x plus h minus x over h. Well,
344:53 - that simplifies to the limit of h over h,
since the Xs can't So in other words, the
344:58 - limit as h goes to zero of one, which is one
as wanted
345:03 - x,
345:04 - x,
345:05 - h to the n minus one, and then finally, a
term of h to the N. That's the binomial expansion
345:20 - of x plus h to the n. Now, we still have to
subtract the x to the n that we had up here,
345:33 - and we still have to divide this whole thing
by H. Okay, that's looking kind of horribly
345:40 - complicated.
345:41 - h to the n minus one, and then finally, a
term of h to the N. That's the binomial expansion
345:53 - of x plus h to the n. Now, we still have to
subtract the x to the n that we had up here,
346:03 - and we still have to divide this whole thing
by H. Okay, that's looking kind of horribly
346:12 - complicated.
346:13 - But
346:14 - But
346:15 - notice that the X to the ends can So notice
that all of the remaining terms have an H
346:20 - in them. So if we factor out that H, we get
an x to the n minus one, plus a bunch of other
346:32 - terms. And canceling the H's,
346:34 - notice that the X to the ends can So notice
that all of the remaining terms have an H
346:42 - in them. So if we factor out that H, we get
an x to the n minus one, plus a bunch of other
346:49 - terms. And canceling the H's,
346:51 - we get
346:52 - we get
346:53 - one term that doesn't have any ages in it,
and another bunch of terms that all have H's
347:00 - in them, as h goes to zero, all these other
terms drop out because they go to zero. And
347:06 - what we're left with is simply n times x to
the n minus one, which is exactly what we
347:15 - want for the power role. I think that's a
pretty good proof if you're comfortable with
347:20 - the binomial formula. But if you haven't seen
the binomial formula before, that might leave
347:26 - you feeling a little cold. So I'm going to
offer you another proof using the other form
347:31 - of the limit definition of derivative. So
let me clear some space here. And I'll start
347:34 - over using this definition, f prime at a is
the limit as x goes to a of our function evaluated
347:42 - at x. So that's x to the n minus our function
evaluated at a, that's a to the n over x minus
347:52 - a. Again, I'm going to need to rewrite things
in order to evaluate this limit, since it's
348:01 - currently in a zero over zero and determinant
form. So I'm going to rewrite the top by factoring
348:08 - out a copy of x minus a, which gives me x
to the n minus one plus x to the n minus two
348:17 - A plus x to the n minus three A squared, you
see the pattern here. And I keep going until
348:34 - I get to x a to the n minus two and finally
a to the n minus one, that's still over x
348:42 - minus a, you can verify this factoring formula,
simply by multiplying out and checking that
348:48 - you In fact, do get x to the n minus a to
the n, after all your intermediate terms cancel.
348:55 - Now that I've factored, I can cancel my x
minus a, and simply evaluate my limit by plugging
349:01 - in x equal to A to get a to the n minus one
plus a to the n minus two A plus, and so on
349:10 - each of these terms is equal to a to the n
minus one. And there are a total of n terms,
349:17 - since we got them from the terms above that
started with x to the n minus one and did
349:24 - with x to the zero. So that's n terms. So
that means we've got a final sum of n times
349:30 - a to the n minus one for a derivative f prime
of A, which is exactly what we wanted to show.
349:38 - Next, I'll prove the constant multiple rule
that says that if c is a real number constant,
349:43 - and f is a differentiable function, then the
derivative of a constant times f is just the
349:50 - constant times the derivative of f. Starting
with the limit definition of derivative, I
349:53 - have that the derivative of C times f of x
is the limit as h goes to zero of C times
349:56 - f of x plus h minus c times f of x over h.
Now if I factor out the constant C, from both
350:02 - of these terms, and actually I can pull it
all the way out of the limit side, since the
350:12 - constant has nothing to do with h. So now
I get that was equal to the constant times
350:16 - the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus
h minus f of x over h, which is just a constant
350:26 - times the derivative of f, which is what we
wanted to prove.
350:29 - one term that doesn't have any ages in it,
and another bunch of terms that all have H's
350:37 - in them, as h goes to zero, all these other
terms drop out because they go to zero. And
350:46 - what we're left with is simply n times x to
the n minus one, which is exactly what we
350:53 - want for the power role. I think that's a
pretty good proof if you're comfortable with
351:02 - the binomial formula. But if you haven't seen
the binomial formula before, that might leave
351:09 - you feeling a little cold. So I'm going to
offer you another proof using the other form
351:15 - of the limit definition of derivative. So
let me clear some space here. And I'll start
351:19 - over using this definition, f prime at a is
the limit as x goes to a of our function evaluated
351:27 - at x. So that's x to the n minus our function
evaluated at a, that's a to the n over x minus
351:36 - a. Again, I'm going to need to rewrite things
in order to evaluate this limit, since it's
351:38 - currently in a zero over zero and determinant
form. So I'm going to rewrite the top by factoring
351:41 - out a copy of x minus a, which gives me x
to the n minus one plus x to the n minus two
351:46 - A plus x to the n minus three A squared, you
see the pattern here. And I keep going until
351:54 - I get to x a to the n minus two and finally
a to the n minus one, that's still over x
352:02 - minus a, you can verify this factoring formula,
simply by multiplying out and checking that
352:06 - you In fact, do get x to the n minus a to
the n, after all your intermediate terms cancel.
352:13 - Now that I've factored, I can cancel my x
minus a, and simply evaluate my limit by plugging
352:21 - in x equal to A to get a to the n minus one
plus a to the n minus two A plus, and so on
352:29 - each of these terms is equal to a to the n
minus one. And there are a total of n terms,
352:35 - since we got them from the terms above that
started with x to the n minus one and did
352:41 - with x to the zero. So that's n terms. So
that means we've got a final sum of n times
352:51 - a to the n minus one for a derivative f prime
of A, which is exactly what we wanted to show.
353:03 - Next, I'll prove the constant multiple rule
that says that if c is a real number constant,
353:11 - and f is a differentiable function, then the
derivative of a constant times f is just the
353:17 - constant times the derivative of f. Starting
with the limit definition of derivative, I
353:25 - have that the derivative of C times f of x
is the limit as h goes to zero of C times
353:31 - f of x plus h minus c times f of x over h.
Now if I factor out the constant C, from both
353:46 - of these terms, and actually I can pull it
all the way out of the limit side, since the
353:52 - constant has nothing to do with h. So now
I get that was equal to the constant times
354:04 - the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus
h minus f of x over h, which is just a constant
354:12 - times the derivative of f, which is what we
wanted to prove.
354:15 - The difference rule can be proved just like
the sum rule by writing out the definition
354:17 - of derivative and regrouping terms. Or we
could use kind of a sneaky shortcut, and put
354:22 - together two of our previous roles. So if
we think of f of x minus g of x as being f
354:29 - of x plus minus one times g of x, then we
can use the sum rule to rewrite this as a
354:38 - sum of derivatives, and then use the constant
multiplier rule to pull the constant of negative
354:45 - one out, and then we have exactly what we
wanted to prove. So in this video, we gave
354:51 - the proof of the content multiple rule, the
summon difference rules, and a proof of the
354:55 - power rule when n is a positive integer. This
video gives rules for calculating derivatives
355:01 - of functions that are products, or quotients
of other functions. In this video, you'll
355:06 - find statements of the product rule and the
quotient rule, and some examples. But no proofs,
355:13 - proofs are in a separate video. Before we
start, let's recall the Psalm and the difference
355:20 - rules. If f and g are differentiable functions,
then the derivative of the psalm f of x plus
355:28 - g of x is just the sum of the derivatives.
And a similar statement holds for differences.
355:39 - The derivative of the difference is the difference
of the derivatives. So does the same sort
355:48 - of rule hold for products of functions, in
other words, is the derivative of the product
355:57 - equal to the product of the derivatives? Let's
look at a simple example. To find out. For
356:05 - example, if f of x is x, and g of x is x squared,
then if we take the derivative of the product,
356:16 - x times x squared, well, that's just the derivative
of x cubed. We know how to do that with the
356:24 - power rule. So it's 3x squared. On the other
hand, if we look at the product of the derivatives,
356:38 - we get one times 2x or just 2x. And these
two things are not equal. So unfortunately,
356:47 - the answer is no such a simple product rule
does not hold. But not lose hope. There is
356:54 - a product rule, it's just a little more complicated
than the sum and difference rule. The product
357:04 - rule says that 
if f and g are differentiable functions, then
357:14 - the derivative of the product f of x times
g of x is equal to f of x times the derivative
357:21 - of g of x plus the derivative of f of x times
g of x. In other words, to take the derivative
357:28 - of a product, we take the first function times
the derivative of the second, plus the derivative
357:35 - of the first times the second. Let's use this
in an example. To take the derivative of the
357:45 - square root of t times e to the t, we have
to take the first function squared of t times
357:55 - the derivative of the second function, plus
the derivative of the first function
357:58 - The difference rule can be proved just like
the sum rule by writing out the definition
358:04 - of derivative and regrouping terms. Or we
could use kind of a sneaky shortcut, and put
358:13 - together two of our previous roles. So if
we think of f of x minus g of x as being f
358:19 - of x plus minus one times g of x, then we
can use the sum rule to rewrite this as a
358:26 - sum of derivatives, and then use the constant
multiplier rule to pull the constant of negative
358:35 - one out, and then we have exactly what we
wanted to prove. So in this video, we gave
358:42 - the proof of the content multiple rule, the
summon difference rules, and a proof of the
358:51 - power rule when n is a positive integer. This
video gives rules for calculating derivatives
358:56 - of functions that are products, or quotients
of other functions. In this video, you'll
358:59 - find statements of the product rule and the
quotient rule, and some examples. But no proofs,
359:04 - proofs are in a separate video. Before we
start, let's recall the Psalm and the difference
359:09 - rules. If f and g are differentiable functions,
then the derivative of the psalm f of x plus
359:17 - g of x is just the sum of the derivatives.
And a similar statement holds for differences.
359:25 - The derivative of the difference is the difference
of the derivatives. So does the same sort
359:31 - of rule hold for products of functions, in
other words, is the derivative of the product
359:38 - equal to the product of the derivatives? Let's
look at a simple example. To find out. For
359:46 - example, if f of x is x, and g of x is x squared,
then if we take the derivative of the product,
360:00 - x times x squared, well, that's just the derivative
of x cubed. We know how to do that with the
360:13 - power rule. So it's 3x squared. On the other
hand, if we look at the product of the derivatives,
360:23 - we get one times 2x or just 2x. And these
two things are not equal. So unfortunately,
360:33 - the answer is no such a simple product rule
does not hold. But not lose hope. There is
360:40 - a product rule, it's just a little more complicated
than the sum and difference rule. The product
360:48 - rule says that if f and g are differentiable
functions, then the derivative of the product
360:52 - f of x times g of x is equal to f of x times
the derivative of g of x plus the derivative
360:57 - of f of x times g of x. In other words, to
take the derivative of a product, we take
361:06 - the first function times the derivative of
the second, plus the derivative of the first
361:15 - times the second. Let's use this in an example.
To take the derivative of the square root
361:23 - of t times e to the t, we have to take the
first function squared of t times the derivative
361:28 - of the second function, plus the derivative
of the first function
361:30 - times the second function. So that's the square
root of t times the derivative of e to the
361:36 - t is just e to the t.
361:38 - times the second function. So that's the square
root of t times the derivative of e to the
361:44 - t is just e to the t.
361:46 - And to find the derivative of the square root
of t, it's going to be easier to write it
361:57 - in exponential form. Now we can just use the
power roll. Bring down the one half t to the
362:10 - one half minus one is negative one half and
I found the derivative. I'm going to clean
362:15 - this up a little bit, and I'm done. quotient
rule says that the derivative of a quotient
362:19 - of two functions
362:20 - And to find the derivative of the square root
of t, it's going to be easier to write it
362:27 - in exponential form. Now we can just use the
power roll. Bring down the one half t to the
362:33 - one half minus one is negative one half and
I found the derivative. I'm going to clean
362:39 - this up a little bit, and I'm done. quotient
rule says that the derivative of a quotient
362:45 - of two functions
362:46 - is given By this quotient on the denominator,
we have the denominator function g of x squared.
362:52 - And on the numerator, we have g of x times
the derivative
362:55 - is given By this quotient on the denominator,
we have the denominator function g of x squared.
362:58 - And on the numerator, we have g of x times
the derivative
363:04 - of f of x
363:05 - of f of x
363:07 - minus f of x times the derivative of g of
x. The way I remember this is this chant.
363:13 - If you think of f of x as the high function,
and g of x is a low function, you can say
363:22 - this is low D high minus high D low
363:27 - minus f of x times the derivative of g of
x. The way I remember this is this chant.
363:36 - If you think of f of x as the high function,
and g of x is a low function, you can say
363:46 - this is low D high minus high D low
363:50 - over low low,
363:52 - over low low,
363:53 - we're low low means the low function squared.
Let's start with a pretty simple example.
364:00 - So this derivative, taking us back to z here,
364:04 - we're low low means the low function squared.
Let's start with a pretty simple example.
364:11 - So this derivative, taking us back to z here,
364:14 - we put the low low on the bottom, and then
we go low,
364:17 - we put the low low on the bottom, and then
we go low,
364:23 - D high.
364:24 - D high.
364:25 - z squared is to z minus high, D low the derivative
of Z's cubed plus one is three z squared plus
364:33 - zero, don't really need to write the zero
there, I can simplify here a little bit to
364:37 - z to the fourth plus two z minus three z to
the fourth,
364:41 - z squared is to z minus high, D low the derivative
of Z's cubed plus one is three z squared plus
364:49 - zero, don't really need to write the zero
there, I can simplify here a little bit to
364:56 - z to the fourth plus two z minus three z to
the fourth,
365:01 - over, I'm
365:02 - over, I'm
365:03 - not going to bother multiplying out this denominator,
I think it looks simpler with it factored.
365:08 - So when I cancel things on the numerator,
I'm getting to z minus z to the fourth over
365:14 - z cubed plus one squared as the derivative
of my quotient. So in this video, we saw the
365:21 - product rule and the quotient rule. I've written
the rules here using the prime notation instead
365:26 - of the dy dx notation, but you should check
that the formulas are really the same as before.
365:33 - For the proofs of these fabulously useful
rules, you'll have to watch the next video.
365:41 - In this video, I'll prove the product rule
and the quotient rule, along with one more
365:46 - related rule, called the reciprocal rule.
First, the proof of the product rule. To find
365:54 - the derivative of the product, f of x times
g of x, I'm going to start as usual with the
366:04 - limit definition of derivative. So the limit
as h goes to zero of f of x plus h g of x
366:10 - plus h minus f of x g of x, Oliver H. Now
I'd like to make this expression here look
366:15 - more like the expression above it, which is
where I'm heading for. And to do this, I'm
366:22 - going to use a classic trick of adding zero
to my expression and kind of a devious way.
366:27 - So I'm going to rewrite my expression, leaving
the first term and the last term of the numerator
366:35 - as they are, but inserting two new terms that
cancel. So I'm subtracting the term, f of
366:42 - x, g of x plus h, and then adding it back
again. So they won't change the value of my
366:52 - expression. This is not as pointless as it
seems, because now we can factor out the common
366:58 - factor of g of x plus h from the first two
terms, and the common factor of f of x from
367:05 - the next two terms. So I'm going to do that.
And now I'll rewrite again, splitting up my
367:11 - sum into two pieces here. You can use just
algebra fractions to see that this expression
367:19 - here and this expression here are the same.
Notice that I'm taking the limit of this entire
367:29 - expression here. Now my limit rules allow
me to rewrite this limit as four separate
367:40 - limits, provided that these four limits do
in fact exist, which that tell you show you
367:48 - in a moment that they do. So this first limit
here is just equal to g of x, because G is
367:58 - a continuous function. G is continuous because
by assumption it's differentiable, so it has
368:04 - to be continuous. This second limit here,
you'll recognize as the definition of the
368:10 - derivative of f, so that limit exists at equals
d dx of f of x. The third limit, well, f of
368:19 - x has nothing to do with age. So that limit
is just f of x. And finally, the fourth limit
368:24 - is the derivative of g. And we've done it.
Well, modulus some minor rearrangement, you'll
368:29 - see that this expression here, is exactly
the same as this expression here, just with
368:36 - the order of the terms switched around. Before
we go on to prove the quotient rule, it'll
368:41 - be really handy to prove the reciprocal rule,
which states that the derivative of reciprocal,
368:49 - one over f of x is given by negative the derivative
of f of x divided by f of x squared. So to
368:59 - prove this fact, let's start as usual, with
the definition of derivative. The derivative
369:05 - of one over f of x is the limit as h goes
to zero of one over f of
369:14 - not going to bother multiplying out this denominator,
I think it looks simpler with it factored.
369:23 - So when I cancel things on the numerator,
I'm getting to z minus z to the fourth over
369:30 - z cubed plus one squared as the derivative
of my quotient. So in this video, we saw the
369:37 - product rule and the quotient rule. I've written
the rules here using the prime notation instead
369:42 - of the dy dx notation, but you should check
that the formulas are really the same as before.
369:50 - For the proofs of these fabulously useful
rules, you'll have to watch the next video.
369:56 - In this video, I'll prove the product rule
and the quotient rule, along with one more
370:02 - related rule, called the reciprocal rule.
First, the proof of the product rule. To find
370:08 - the derivative of the product, f of x times
g of x, I'm going to start as usual with the
370:13 - limit definition of derivative. So the limit
as h goes to zero of f of x plus h g of x
370:20 - plus h minus f of x g of x, Oliver H. Now
I'd like to make this expression here look
370:27 - more like the expression above it, which is
where I'm heading for. And to do this, I'm
370:36 - going to use a classic trick of adding zero
to my expression and kind of a devious way.
370:43 - So I'm going to rewrite my expression, leaving
the first term and the last term of the numerator
370:52 - as they are, but inserting two new terms that
cancel. So I'm subtracting the term, f of
370:58 - x, g of x plus h, and then adding it back
again. So they won't change the value of my
371:10 - expression. This is not as pointless as it
seems, because now we can factor out the common
371:16 - factor of g of x plus h from the first two
terms, and the common factor of f of x from
371:23 - the next two terms. So I'm going to do that.
And now I'll rewrite again, splitting up my
371:29 - sum into two pieces here. You can use just
algebra fractions to see that this expression
371:36 - here and this expression here are the same.
Notice that I'm taking the limit of this entire
371:42 - expression here. Now my limit rules allow
me to rewrite this limit as four separate
371:47 - limits, provided that these four limits do
in fact exist, which that tell you show you
371:53 - in a moment that they do. So this first limit
here is just equal to g of x, because G is
372:01 - a continuous function. G is continuous because
by assumption it's differentiable, so it has
372:05 - to be continuous. This second limit here,
you'll recognize as the definition of the
372:10 - derivative of f, so that limit exists at equals
d dx of f of x. The third limit, well, f of
372:18 - x has nothing to do with age. So that limit
is just f of x. And finally, the fourth limit
372:27 - is the derivative of g. And we've done it.
Well, modulus some minor rearrangement, you'll
372:32 - see that this expression here, is exactly
the same as this expression here, just with
372:38 - the order of the terms switched around. Before
we go on to prove the quotient rule, it'll
372:45 - be really handy to prove the reciprocal rule,
which states that the derivative of reciprocal,
372:50 - one over f of x is given by negative the derivative
of f of x divided by f of x squared. So to
372:57 - prove this fact, let's start as usual, with
the definition of derivative. The derivative
373:03 - of one over f of x is the limit as h goes
to zero of one over f of
373:15 - x plus
373:16 - x plus
373:17 - h minus one over f of x over h. Now, these
fractions here are just crying out to be combined
373:26 - by finding a common denominator that common
denominators f of x plus h times f of x. So
373:32 - let me do that. I've just multiplied the first
fraction by f of x over f of x and the second
373:41 - fraction by f of x plus h over f of x plus
h in order to rewrite with a common denominator.
373:46 - So that gives me f of x minus f of x plus
h divided by f of x plus h times f of x. And
373:54 - instead of dividing this whole thing by H,
I'll multiply it by one of our age, which
374:02 - gives me another factor of H in the denominator.
Now, this expression here is looking a lot
374:08 - like the derivative of
374:09 - h minus one over f of x over h. Now, these
fractions here are just crying out to be combined
374:17 - by finding a common denominator that common
denominators f of x plus h times f of x. So
374:22 - let me do that. I've just multiplied the first
fraction by f of x over f of x and the second
374:29 - fraction by f of x plus h over f of x plus
h in order to rewrite with a common denominator.
374:35 - So that gives me f of x minus f of x plus
h divided by f of x plus h times f of x. And
374:43 - instead of dividing this whole thing by H,
I'll multiply it by one of our age, which
374:47 - gives me another factor of H in the denominator.
Now, this expression here is looking a lot
374:55 - like the derivative of
374:56 - f.
374:57 - f.
374:58 - It's just in the reverse order. So let me
factor out a negative sign in order to let
375:02 - me switch that order here. So this becomes
f of x plus h minus f of x over h, and then
375:10 - I've got the times one over f of x plus h
times f of x. Now I can split this limit up
375:22 - first, I'll factor out the negative sign.
And then I'll write this product as a product
375:29 - of two limits, which I can do provided the
component limits exist. And I'll check that
375:35 - these limits do exist. Let's see the first
limit here. The first limit here is just the
375:39 - derivative of
375:40 - It's just in the reverse order. So let me
factor out a negative sign in order to let
375:46 - me switch that order here. So this becomes
f of x plus h minus f of x over h, and then
375:52 - I've got the times one over f of x plus h
times f of x. Now I can split this limit up
376:06 - first, I'll factor out the negative sign.
And then I'll write this product as a product
376:10 - of two limits, which I can do provided the
component limits exist. And I'll check that
376:18 - these limits do exist. Let's see the first
limit here. The first limit here is just the
376:27 - derivative of
376:28 - f.
376:29 - f.
376:30 - And the second limit here exists because f
is continuous, f is continuous since is differentiable.
376:37 - So by continuity, as H is going to zero, since
x plus h is approaching x, f of x plus h is
376:46 - just approaching f of x. And I can rewrite
this limit as one over f of x times f of x.
376:56 - And so this is in other words, negative the
derivative of f of x divided by f of x squared.
377:10 - Now we've proved the reciprocal rule. Now
we're in a great position to prove the quotient
377:19 - rule with very little effort. So instead of
going back to the definition of derivative,
377:26 - this time, I'm just gonna think of the quotient
f of x over g of x as a product of f of x
377:39 - times the reciprocal
377:41 - And the second limit here exists because f
is continuous, f is continuous since is differentiable.
377:48 - So by continuity, as H is going to zero, since
x plus h is approaching x, f of x plus h is
378:01 - just approaching f of x. And I can rewrite
this limit as one over f of x times f of x.
378:12 - And so this is in other words, negative the
derivative of f of x divided by f of x squared.
378:21 - Now we've proved the reciprocal rule. Now
we're in a great position to prove the quotient
378:28 - rule with very little effort. So instead of
going back to the definition of derivative,
378:37 - this time, I'm just gonna think of the quotient
f of x over g of x as a product of f of x
378:51 - times the reciprocal
378:52 - of g of x.
378:54 - of g of x.
378:56 - And now, by the product rule, that's just
the first function times the derivative of
379:05 - the second plus the derivative of the first
times the second. And by the quotient rule,
379:11 - the derivative of this reciprocal is negative
derivative of g over g of x squared. And I
379:15 - still have this second term here, which I'm
just going to write as derivative f of x divided
379:22 - by g of x.
379:23 - And now, by the product rule, that's just
the first function times the derivative of
379:29 - the second plus the derivative of the first
times the second. And by the quotient rule,
379:38 - the derivative of this reciprocal is negative
derivative of g over g of x squared. And I
379:47 - still have this second term here, which I'm
just going to write as derivative f of x divided
379:56 - by g of x.
379:58 - Okay,
379:59 - Okay,
380:00 - so we're almost there. If we combine these
two fractions, using a common denominator
380:07 - of g of x squared, we just have to multiply
this second fraction by g of x over g of x
380:15 - to get that common denominator. Now we get
negative f of x times the derivative of g
380:18 - of x plus the derivative of f of x times g
of x divided by g of x squared. And hopefully,
380:28 - this bottom expression is the same as this
top expression. And, yes, after rearranging
380:34 - the terms it is. So that's the end of the
proof of the quotient rule. So this video
380:40 - gave proofs of the product rule, the reciprocal
rule, and then the quotient rule. This video
380:48 - is about two limits involving trig functions
that turn out to be very useful. Namely, the
380:55 - limit as theta goes to zero of sine theta
380:58 - so we're almost there. If we combine these
two fractions, using a common denominator
381:04 - of g of x squared, we just have to multiply
this second fraction by g of x over g of x
381:13 - to get that common denominator. Now we get
negative f of x times the derivative of g
381:19 - of x plus the derivative of f of x times g
of x divided by g of x squared. And hopefully,
381:28 - this bottom expression is the same as this
top expression. And, yes, after rearranging
381:35 - the terms it is. So that's the end of the
proof of the quotient rule. So this video
381:44 - gave proofs of the product rule, the reciprocal
rule, and then the quotient rule. This video
381:50 - is about two limits involving trig functions
that turn out to be very useful. Namely, the
382:00 - limit as theta goes to zero of sine theta
382:02 - over theta. And the limit as theta goes to
zero of cosine theta minus one over theta.
382:09 - These limits turn out to have really nice
simple answers, as long as we keep theta in
382:16 - radians,
382:17 - over theta. And the limit as theta goes to
zero of cosine theta minus one over theta.
382:25 - These limits turn out to have really nice
simple answers, as long as we keep theta in
382:33 - radians,
382:34 - not degrees. Let's consider the limit on the
left first, that's the limit as theta goes
382:39 - to zero of sine theta over theta. Notice that
we can't just evaluate this limit by plugging
382:48 - in zero for theta, because as theta goes to
zero sine theta, and the numerator also goes
382:52 - to zero, and theta itself goes to zero, so
we end up with a zero over zero indeterminate
382:54 - form. We can however, build up some evidence
of what this limit by might be by using a
382:59 - calculator and a table of values, or by looking
at a graph. So here's the theta axis. And
383:05 - here's the y axis. And you can see that as
theta goes to zero from either the right or
383:13 - the left, it's looking like the y value is
going to one. The second limit here on the
383:20 - right, is also zero over zero and determinant
form. Since as theta goes to zero, cosine
383:25 - theta goes to one, so cosine theta minus one
goes to zero. But again, looking at the graph,
383:35 - we have some evidence to suggest that as theta
goes to zero, our expression is also going
383:43 - to
383:44 - not degrees. Let's consider the limit on the
left first, that's the limit as theta goes
383:45 - to zero of sine theta over theta. Notice that
we can't just evaluate this limit by plugging
383:48 - in zero for theta, because as theta goes to
zero sine theta, and the numerator also goes
383:51 - to zero, and theta itself goes to zero, so
we end up with a zero over zero indeterminate
383:59 - form. We can however, build up some evidence
of what this limit by might be by using a
384:07 - calculator and a table of values, or by looking
at a graph. So here's the theta axis. And
384:19 - here's the y axis. And you can see that as
theta goes to zero from either the right or
384:28 - the left, it's looking like the y value is
going to one. The second limit here on the
384:36 - right, is also zero over zero and determinant
form. Since as theta goes to zero, cosine
384:43 - theta goes to one, so cosine theta minus one
goes to zero. But again, looking at the graph,
384:53 - we have some evidence to suggest that as theta
goes to zero, our expression is also going
384:59 - to
385:00 - zero.
385:01 - zero.
385:02 - these graphs provide strong evidence, but
graphs can be misleading, and they're no substitute
385:06 - for a rigorous proof. So for a pretty cool
geometric and algebraic proof of these facts,
385:15 - please see the proof video for this section.
The fact that the limit as theta goes to zero
385:23 - of sine theta over theta is one is really
handy when you want to approximate sine theta.
385:32 - Because intuitively, this is saying that sine
theta is approximately equal to theta itself
385:37 - when theta is near zero, because the ratio
is approximately one. So if I want to approximate
385:44 - sine of this value of theta, without a calculator,
I can use that fact. And say that the sine
385:51 - of 0.01769 is going to be approximately equal
to 0.01769. This is an important time to remind
385:58 - you that when we're doing these limits, we're
assuming that theta is in radians. If it's
386:06 - not in radians, we won't get this nice limit
of one here. So that's our approximation.
386:13 - And we can check it on a calculator, and I
actually get an exact value of this number
386:22 - up to 10 decimal places. So as you can see,
this is a really good approximation. We can
386:28 - use this same limit fat, again, in the next
example, to calculate this complicated limit
386:33 - as x goes to zero, the limit of tan of 7x
over sine of forex. So when I see tangents
386:43 - and signs and expression, I'm always tempted
to rewrite things. And just in terms of sine
386:50 - and cosine, so I'm going to do that first
I'm going to rewrite tangent as as sine over
386:54 - cosine. That still divided by sine of forex,
and now I'm going to flip and multiply to
387:01 - get sine of 7x over cosine of 7x times one
over sine of 4x. Now intuitively, if x is
387:09 - near zero, therefore 7x and 4x are also near
zero, then sine of 7x is approximately equal
387:17 - to 7x. And sine of 4x is approximately equal
to 4x. So intuitively, this limit should be
387:23 - pretty much the same thing as the limit as
x goes to zero of 7x over cosine 7x times
387:33 - 4x. And canceling the access, this is just
the same as seven fourths times the limit
387:42 - of one of our cosine 7x. Since cosine of 7x
is going to one, this should just be seven
387:50 - fourths. So this is the intuitive approach,
let me also give you a more rigorous approach.
387:54 - So more rigorously, I'm going to rewrite this
limit by multiplying by 7x over 7x. And by
387:59 - multiplying by 4x, over 4x, that hasn't changed
my expression, I'm just multiplying by one
388:06 - and fancy forms. But this is really useful.
Because if I regroup here, and write the sine
388:12 - 7x over the 7x, times the one over cosine
7x. Now I'm going to write the Forex over
388:19 - the sign for x. And I'm still left with a
7x from the top and a 4x. From the bottom
388:27 - here, I can cancel out those x's. And I can
notice that this limit here, as x goes to
388:36 - 07, x is going to zero, so sine 7x over 7x
is just going to be equal to one. And similarly
388:45 - as x goes to zero, for x is going to zero.
So the limit of 4x ever signed for x is the
388:48 - reciprocal of one, it's also one. And finally,
this limit in the middle here, as x goes to
388:50 - 07, x is going to zero, so cosine of 7x is
going to one, and everything in the world
388:57 - is going to one except the 7/4. So this limit
is seven forth.
389:04 - these graphs provide strong evidence, but
graphs can be misleading, and they're no substitute
389:11 - for a rigorous proof. So for a pretty cool
geometric and algebraic proof of these facts,
389:19 - please see the proof video for this section.

393:27 - is going to one except the 7/4. So this limit
is seven forth.
393:34 - In this video, we found that the limit as
theta goes to zero of sine theta over theta
393:42 - is equal to one. And the limit as theta goes
to zero of cosine theta minus one over theta
393:51 - is equal to zero. There's a nice proof of
these facts in a later video for this section.
393:57 - When you compose two functions, you apply
the first function. And then you apply the
394:04 - second function to the output of the first
function. For example, the first function
394:11 - might compute population size from time in
years.
394:12 - In this video, we found that the limit as
theta goes to zero of sine theta over theta
394:15 - is equal to one. And the limit as theta goes
to zero of cosine theta minus one over theta
394:24 - is equal to zero. There's a nice proof of
these facts in a later video for this section.
394:31 - When you compose two functions, you apply
the first function. And then you apply the
394:36 - second function to the output of the first
function. For example, the first function
394:40 - might compute population size from time in
years.
394:43 - So its input would be time in years, since
a certain date, as output would be number
394:49 - of people in the population. The second function
g, might compute health care costs as a function
394:55 - of population size. So it will take population
size as input, and its output will be healthcare
394:58 - costs. If you put these functions together,
that is compose them, then you'll go all the
395:02 - way from time in years to healthcare costs.
This is your composition, g composed with
395:09 - F. The composition of two functions, written
g with a little circle, f of x is defined
395:12 - as follows. g composed with f of x is G evaluated
on f of x, we can think of it schematically
395:19 - and so diagram, f acts on a number x and produces
a number f of x, then g takes that output
395:26 - f of x and produces a new number, g of f of
x. Our composition of functions g composed
395:32 - with F is the function that goes all the way
from X to g of f of x. Let's work out some
395:41 - examples where our functions are defined by
tables of values. If we want to find g composed
395:49 - with F of four, by definition, this means
g of f of four. To evaluate this expression,
395:56 - we always work from the inside out. So we
start with the x value of four, and we find
396:07 - f of four using the table of values for f
of x. When x equals four, f of x is seven,
396:18 - so we can replace F of four with the number
seven. Now we need to evaluate g of seven,
396:27 - seven becomes our new x value in our table
of values for G, the x value of seven corresponds
396:41 - to the G of X value of 10. So g of seven is
equal to 10. We found that g composed with
396:52 - F of four is equal to 10. If instead we want
to find f composed with g of four, well, we
396:58 - can rewrite that is f of g of four, and again,
work from the inside out. Now we're trying
397:07 - to find g of four, so four is our x value.
And we use our table of values for G to see
397:14 - that g of four is one. So we replaced by a
four by one, and now we need to evaluate f
397:19 - of one. Using our table for F values, f of
one is eight. Notice that when we've computed
397:25 - g of f of four, we got a different answer
there when we computed F of G, F four. And
397:29 - in general, g composed with F is not the same
thing as f composed with g.
397:35 - So its input would be time in years, since
a certain date, as output would be number
397:41 - of people in the population. The second function
g, might compute health care costs as a function
397:49 - of population size. So it will take population
size as input, and its output will be healthcare
397:58 - costs. If you put these functions together,
that is compose them, then you'll go all the
398:06 - way from time in years to healthcare costs.
This is your composition, g composed with
398:12 - F. The composition of two functions, written
g with a little circle, f of x is defined
398:19 - as follows. g composed with f of x is G evaluated
on f of x, we can think of it schematically
398:24 - and so diagram, f acts on a number x and produces
a number f of x, then g takes that output
398:34 - f of x and produces a new number, g of f of
x. Our composition of functions g composed
398:43 - with F is the function that goes all the way
from X to g of f of x. Let's work out some
398:50 - examples where our functions are defined by
tables of values. If we want to find g composed
398:57 - with F of four, by definition, this means
g of f of four. To evaluate this expression,
399:01 - we always work from the inside out. So we
start with the x value of four, and we find
399:07 - f of four using the table of values for f
of x. When x equals four, f of x is seven,
399:13 - so we can replace F of four with the number
seven. Now we need to evaluate g of seven,
399:18 - seven becomes our new x value in our table
of values for G, the x value of seven corresponds
399:23 - to the G of X value of 10. So g of seven is
equal to 10. We found that g composed with
399:32 - F of four is equal to 10. If instead we want
to find f composed with g of four, well, we
399:42 - can rewrite that is f of g of four, and again,
work from the inside out. Now we're trying
399:51 - to find g of four, so four is our x value.
And we use our table of values for G to see
399:58 - that g of four is one. So we replaced by a
four by one, and now we need to evaluate f
400:08 - of one. Using our table for F values, f of
one is eight. Notice that when we've computed
400:14 - g of f of four, we got a different answer
there when we computed F of G, F four. And
400:18 - in general, g composed with F is not the same
thing as f composed with g.
400:25 - Please
400:26 - Please
400:27 - pause the video and take a moment to compute
the next two examples. We can replace f composed
400:37 - with F of two by the equivalent expression,
f of f of two. Working from the inside out,
400:46 - we know that f of two is three, and f of three
is six. If we want to find f composed with
400:52 - g of six, rewrite that as f of g of six isn't
the table for g, g of six is eight. But F
400:59 - of eight, eight is not on the table as an
x value for the for the f function. And so
401:06 - there is no F of eight, this does not exist,
we can say that six is not in the domain,
401:11 - for F composed with g. Even though it was
in the domain of g, we couldn't follow all
401:14 - the way through and get a value for F composed
with g of six. Next, let's turn our attention
401:23 - to the composition of functions that are given
by equations.
401:25 - pause the video and take a moment to compute
the next two examples. We can replace f composed
401:31 - with F of two by the equivalent expression,
f of f of two. Working from the inside out,
401:34 - we know that f of two is three, and f of three
is six. If we want to find f composed with
401:41 - g of six, rewrite that as f of g of six isn't
the table for g, g of six is eight. But F
401:52 - of eight, eight is not on the table as an
x value for the for the f function. And so
401:58 - there is no F of eight, this does not exist,
we can say that six is not in the domain,
402:04 - for F composed with g. Even though it was
in the domain of g, we couldn't follow all
402:11 - the way through and get a value for F composed
with g of six. Next, let's turn our attention
402:21 - to the composition of functions that are given
by equations.
402:25 - p of x is x squared plus x and q of x is negative
2x. We want to find q composed with P of one.
402:36 - p of x is x squared plus x and q of x is negative
2x. We want to find q composed with P of one.
402:45 - As usual, I can rewrite this as Q of P of
one and work from the inside out. P of one
402:54 - is one squared plus one, so that's two. So
this is the same thing as Q of two. But queue
403:03 - of two is negative two times two or negative
four. So this evaluates to negative four.
403:11 - In this next example, we want to find q composed
with P of some arbitrary x, or rewrite it
403:16 - as usual as Q of p of x and work from the
inside out. Well, p of x, we know the formula
403:23 - for that, that's x squared plus x. So I can
replace my P of x with that expression. Now,
403:31 - I'm stuck with evaluating q on x squared plus
x. Well queue of anything is negative two
403:37 - times that thing. So q of x squared plus x
is going to be negative two times the quantity
403:45 - x squared plus x, what I've done is I've substituted
in the whole expression x squared plus x,
403:52 - where I saw the X in this formula for q of
x, it's important to use the parentheses here,
403:59 - so that we'll be multiplying negative two
by the whole expression and not just by the
404:04 - first piece, I can simplify this a bit as
negative 2x squared minus 2x. And that's my
404:11 - expression for Q composed with p of x. Notice
that if I wanted to compute q composed with
404:19 - P of one, which I already did in the first
problem, I could just use this expression
404:24 - now, negative two times one squared minus
two and I get negative four, just like I did
404:29 - before. Let's try another one. Let's try p
composed with q of x. First I read right this
404:38 - P of q of x. Working from the inside out,
I can replace q of x with negative 2x. So
404:46 - I need to compute P of negative 2x. Here's
my formula for P. to compute P of this expression,
404:56 - I need to plug in this expression everywhere
I see an x in the formula for P. So that means
405:02 - negative 2x squared plus negative 2x. Again,
being careful to use parentheses to make sure
405:11 - I plug in the entire expression in for x.
let me simplify. This is 4x squared minus
405:19 - 2x. Notice that I got different expressions
for Q of p of x. And for P of q of x. Once
405:27 - again, we see that q composed with P is not
necessarily equal to P composed with Q. Please
405:36 - pause the video and try this last example
yourself rewriting and working from the inside
405:44 - out, we're going to replace p of x with its
expression x squared plus x. And then we need
405:54 - to evaluate p on x squared
405:57 - As usual, I can rewrite this as Q of P of
one and work from the inside out. P of one
406:07 - is one squared plus one, so that's two. So
this is the same thing as Q of two. But queue
406:14 - of two is negative two times two or negative
four. So this evaluates to negative four.
406:21 - In this next example, we want to find q composed
with P of some arbitrary x, or rewrite it
406:30 - as usual as Q of p of x and work from the
inside out. Well, p of x, we know the formula
406:39 - for that, that's x squared plus x. So I can
replace my P of x with that expression. Now,
406:48 - I'm stuck with evaluating q on x squared plus
x. Well queue of anything is negative two
406:58 - times that thing. So q of x squared plus x
is going to be negative two times the quantity
407:04 - x squared plus x, what I've done is I've substituted
in the whole expression x squared plus x,
407:16 - where I saw the X in this formula for q of
x, it's important to use the parentheses here,
407:22 - so that we'll be multiplying negative two
by the whole expression and not just by the
407:34 - first piece, I can simplify this a bit as
negative 2x squared minus 2x. And that's my
407:44 - expression for Q composed with p of x. Notice
that if I wanted to compute q composed with
407:49 - P of one, which I already did in the first
problem, I could just use this expression
407:58 - now, negative two times one squared minus
two and I get negative four, just like I did
408:07 - before. Let's try another one. Let's try p
composed with q of x. First I read right this
408:15 - P of q of x. Working from the inside out,
I can replace q of x with negative 2x. So
408:24 - I need to compute P of negative 2x. Here's
my formula for P. to compute P of this expression,
408:31 - I need to plug in this expression everywhere
I see an x in the formula for P. So that means
408:38 - negative 2x squared plus negative 2x. Again,
being careful to use parentheses to make sure
408:44 - I plug in the entire expression in for x.
let me simplify. This is 4x squared minus
408:52 - 2x. Notice that I got different expressions
for Q of p of x. And for P of q of x. Once
408:58 - again, we see that q composed with P is not
necessarily equal to P composed with Q. Please
409:03 - pause the video and try this last example
yourself rewriting and working from the inside
409:09 - out, we're going to replace p of x with its
expression x squared plus x. And then we need
409:16 - to evaluate p on x squared
409:19 - plus x.
409:20 - plus x.
409:21 - That means we plug in
409:23 - That means we plug in
409:25 - x squared plus x,
409:26 - x squared plus x,
409:28 - everywhere we see an x in this formula, so
that's x squared plus x quantity squared plus
409:36 - x squared plus x. Once again, I can simplify
by distributing out, that gives me x to the
409:43 - fourth plus 2x cubed plus x squared plus x
squared plus x, or x to the fourth plus 2x
409:58 - cubed plus 2x squared plus x. In this last
set of examples, we're asked to go backwards,
410:07 - we're given a formula for a function of h
of x. But we're supposed to rewrite h of x
410:19 - as a composition of two functions, F and G.
Let's think for a minute, which of these two
410:20 - functions gets applied first, f composed with
g of x, let's see, that means f of g of x.
410:27 - And since we evaluate these expressions from
the inside out, we must be applying g first,
410:30 - and then F. In order to figure out what what
f and g could be, I like to draw a box around
410:38 - some thing inside my expression for H, so
I'm going to draw a box around x squared plus
410:42 - seven, then whatever's inside the box, that'll
be my function, g of x, the first function
410:45 - that gets applied, whatever happens to the
box, in this case, taking the square root
410:51 - sign, that becomes my outside function, my
second function f. So here, we're gonna say
410:58 - g of x is equal to x squared plus seven, and
f of x is equal to the square root of x, let's
411:11 - just check and make sure that this works.
So I need to check that when I take the composition,
411:21 - f composed with g, I need to get the same
thing as my original h. So let's see, if I
411:33 - do f composed with g of x, well, by definition,
that's f of g of x.
411:39 - everywhere we see an x in this formula, so
that's x squared plus x quantity squared plus
411:43 - x squared plus x. Once again, I can simplify
by distributing out, that gives me x to the
411:54 - fourth plus 2x cubed plus x squared plus x
squared plus x, or x to the fourth plus 2x
412:04 - cubed plus 2x squared plus x. In this last
set of examples, we're asked to go backwards,
412:15 - we're given a formula for a function of h
of x. But we're supposed to rewrite h of x
412:25 - as a composition of two functions, F and G.
Let's think for a minute, which of these two
412:33 - functions gets applied first, f composed with
g of x, let's see, that means f of g of x.
412:39 - And since we evaluate these expressions from
the inside out, we must be applying g first,
412:45 - and then F. In order to figure out what what
f and g could be, I like to draw a box around
412:54 - some thing inside my expression for H, so
I'm going to draw a box around x squared plus
413:01 - seven, then whatever's inside the box, that'll
be my function, g of x, the first function
413:07 - that gets applied, whatever happens to the
box, in this case, taking the square root
413:13 - sign, that becomes my outside function, my
second function f. So here, we're gonna say
413:20 - g of x is equal to x squared plus seven, and
f of x is equal to the square root of x, let's
413:36 - just check and make sure that this works.
So I need to check that when I take the composition,
413:47 - f composed with g, I need to get the same
thing as my original h. So let's see, if I
413:57 - do f composed with g of x, well, by definition,
that's f of g of x.
414:04 - Working from the inside out, I can replace
g of x with its formula x squared plus seven.
414:12 - So I need to evaluate f of x squared plus
seven. That means I plug in x squared plus
414:23 - seven, into the formula for for F. So that
becomes the square root of x squared plus
414:28 - seven, two, it works because it matches my
original equation. So we found a correct answer
414:36 - a correct way of breaking h down as a composition
of two functions. But I do want to point out,
414:46 - this is not the only correct answer. I'll
write down my formula for H of X again, and
414:55 - this time, I'll put the box in a different
place, I'll just box the x squared. If I did
415:03 - that, then my inside function, my first function,
g of x would be x squared. And my second function
415:12 - is what happens
415:13 - Working from the inside out, I can replace
g of x with its formula x squared plus seven.
415:22 - So I need to evaluate f of x squared plus
seven. That means I plug in x squared plus
415:28 - seven, into the formula for for F. So that
becomes the square root of x squared plus
415:36 - seven, two, it works because it matches my
original equation. So we found a correct answer
415:43 - a correct way of breaking h down as a composition
of two functions. But I do want to point out,
415:52 - this is not the only correct answer. I'll
write down my formula for H of X again, and
415:59 - this time, I'll put the box in a different
place, I'll just box the x squared. If I did
416:10 - that, then my inside function, my first function,
g of x would be x squared. And my second function
416:20 - is what happens
416:21 - to the box.
416:24 - to the box.
416:25 - So my f of x is what happens to the box, and
the box gets added seven to it, and taking
416:38 - the square root. So in other words, f of x
is going to be the square root of x plus seven.
416:43 - Again, I can check that this works. If I do
f composed with g of x, that's f
416:52 - So my f of x is what happens to the box, and
the box gets added seven to it, and taking
417:12 - the square root. So in other words, f of x
is going to be the square root of x plus seven.
417:20 - Again, I can check that this works. If I do
f composed with g of x, that's f
417:26 - of g of x.
417:28 - of g of x.
417:30 - So now g of x is x squared, so I'm taking
f of x squared. When I plug in x squared for
417:39 - x, I do in fact get the square root of x squared
plus seven. So this is an alternative correct
417:47 - solution. In this video, we learn to evaluate
the composition of functions. by rewriting
417:52 - it and working from the inside out. We also
learn to break apart a complicated function
418:00 - into a composition of two functions by boxing
one piece of the function and letting the
418:07 - first function applied in the composition.
Let that be the inside of the box and the
418:14 - second function applied in the composition
be whatever happens to the box.
418:23 - So now g of x is x squared, so I'm taking
f of x squared. When I plug in x squared for
418:32 - x, I do in fact get the square root of x squared
plus seven. So this is an alternative correct
418:38 - solution. In this video, we learn to evaluate
the composition of functions. by rewriting
418:46 - it and working from the inside out. We also
learn to break apart a complicated function
418:52 - into a composition of two functions by boxing
one piece of the function and letting the
419:00 - first function applied in the composition.
Let that be the inside of the box and the
419:07 - second function applied in the composition
be whatever happens to the box.
419:10 - This video is about solving rational equations.
A rational equation like this one equation
419:14 - that has rational expressions and that, in
other words, an equation that has some variables
419:20 - in the denominator. There are several different
approaches for solving a rational equation,
419:25 - but they all start by finding the least common
denominator. In this example, the denominators
419:27 - are x plus three and x, we can think of one
as just having a denominator of one. Since
419:30 - the denominators don't have any factors in
common, I can find the least common denominator
419:38 - just by multiplying them together. My next
step is going to be clearing the denominator.
419:43 - By this, I mean that I multiply both sides
of my equation by this least common denominator,
419:51 - x plus three times x, I multiply on the left
side of the equation, and I multiply by the
419:57 - same thing on the right side of the equation.
Since I'm doing the same thing to both sides
420:04 - of the equation, I don't change the the value
of the equation. Multiplying the least common
420:08 - denominator on both sides of the equation
is equivalent to multiplying it by all three
420:18 - terms in the equation, I can see this when
I multiply out, I'll rewrite the left side
420:24 - the same as before, pretty much. And then
I'll distribute the right side to get x plus
420:31 - three times x times one plus x plus three
times x times one over x. So I've actually
420:36 - multiplied the least common denominator by
all three terms of my equation. Now I can
420:40 - have a blast canceling things. The x plus
three cancels with the x plus three on the
420:47 - denominator. The here are nothing cancels
out because there's no denominator, and here
420:55 - are the x in the numerator cancels with the
x in the denominator. So I can rewrite my
421:09 - expression as x squared equals x plus three
times x times one plus x plus three. Now I'm
421:24 - going to simplify. So I'll leave the x squared
alone on this side, I'll distribute out x
421:34 - squared plus 3x plus x plus three, hey, look,
the x squared is cancel on both sides. And
421:43 - so I get zero equals 4x plus three, so 4x
is negative three, and x is negative three
421:53 - fourths. Finally, I'm going to plug in my
answer to check. This is a good idea for any
422:03 - kind of equation. But it's especially important
for a rational equation because occasionally
422:07 - for rational equations, you'll get what's
called extraneous solution solutions that
422:11 - don't actually work in your original equation
because they make the denominator zero. Now,
422:16 - in this example, I don't think we're going
to get the extraneous equations, because negative
422:23 - three fourths is not going to make any of
these denominators zero, so it should work
422:30 - out fine when I plug in. If I plug in, I get
this, I can simplify the denominator here,
422:36 - negative three fourths plus three, three is
12, for sets becomes nine fourths, and this
422:41 - is one or flip and multiply to get minus four
thirds. So here, I can simplify my complex
422:49 - fraction, it ends up being negative three
nights, and one minus four thirds is negative
422:55 - 1/3. So that all seems to check out. And so
my final answer is x equals negative three
423:03 - fourths. This next example looks a little
trickier. And it is, but the same approach
423:09 - will work. First off, find the least common
denominator. So here, my denominators are
423:13 - c minus five, c plus one, and C squared minus
four c minus five, I'm going to factor that
423:20 - as C minus five times c plus one. Now, my
least common denominator needs to have just
423:25 - enough factors to that each of these denominators
divided into it. So I need the factor c minus
423:29 - five, I need the factor c plus one. And now
I've already got all the factors I need for
423:35 - this denominator. So here is my least common
denominator. Next step is to clear the denominators.
423:41 - So I do this by multiplying both sides of
the equation by my least common denominator.
423:50 - In fact, I can just multiply each of the three
terms by this least common denominator. I
423:59 - went ahead and wrote my third denominator
in factored form to make it easier to see
424:07 - what cancels. Now canceling time dies, this
dies, and both of those factors die.
424:13 - This video is about solving rational equations.
A rational equation like this one equation
424:23 - that has rational expressions and that, in

426:01 - have a blast canceling things. The x plus

426:08 - denominator. The here are nothing cancels
out because there's no denominator, and here
426:19 - are the x in the numerator cancels with the
x in the denominator. So I can rewrite my
426:24 - expression as x squared equals x plus three
times x times one plus x plus three. Now I'm
426:29 - going to simplify. So I'll leave the x squared
alone on this side, I'll distribute out x
426:34 - squared plus 3x plus x plus three, hey, look,
the x squared is cancel on both sides. And
426:41 - so I get zero equals 4x plus three, so 4x
is negative three, and x is negative three
426:48 - fourths. Finally, I'm going to plug in my
answer to check. This is a good idea for any
426:55 - kind of equation. But it's especially important
for a rational equation because occasionally

427:12 - in this example, I don't think we're going

427:19 - three fourths is not going to make any of

my final answer is x equals negative three
427:42 - fourths. This next example looks a little
trickier. And it is, but the same approach
427:48 - will work. First off, find the least common
denominator. So here, my denominators are
427:52 - c minus five, c plus one, and C squared minus
four c minus five, I'm going to factor that
427:58 - as C minus five times c plus one. Now, my
least common denominator needs to have just
428:06 - enough factors to that each of these denominators
divided into it. So I need the factor c minus
428:13 - five, I need the factor c plus one. And now
I've already got all the factors I need for
428:21 - this denominator. So here is my least common
denominator. Next step is to clear the denominators.
428:25 - So I do this by multiplying both sides of
the equation by my least common denominator.
428:29 - In fact, I can just multiply each of the three
terms by this least common denominator. I
428:34 - went ahead and wrote my third denominator
in factored form to make it easier to see
428:40 - what cancels. Now canceling time dies, this
dies, and both of those factors die.
428:46 - cancel out the denominators, the whole point
of multiplying by the least common denominator,
428:52 - you're multiplying by something that's big
enough to kill every single denominator so
428:56 - you don't have to deal with denominators anymore.
Now I'm going to simplify by multiplying out.
429:03 - So I get, let's see, c plus one times four
c, that's four c squared plus four c, now
429:12 - I get minus just c minus five, and then over
here, I get three c squared plus three, I
429:18 - can rewrite the minus quantity c minus five
as a minus c plus five. And now I can subtract
429:26 - the three c squared from both sides to get
just a C squared over here, and the four c
429:30 - minus c, that becomes a three C. And finally,
I can subtract the three from both sides to
429:39 - get c squared plus three c plus two equals
zero. got myself a quadratic equation that
429:47 - looks like a nice one that factors. So this
factors to C plus one times c plus two equals
429:56 - zero. So either c plus one is zero, or C plus
two is zero, so C equals negative one, or
430:06 - C equals negative two. Now let's see, we need
to still check our answers. Without even going
430:13 - to the trouble of calculating anything, I
can see that C equals negative one is not
430:22 - going to work, because if I plug it in to
this denominator here, I get a denominator
430:26 - of zero, which doesn't make sense. So C equals
minus one is an extraneous solution, it doesn't
430:33 - actually satisfy my original equation. And
so I can just cross it right out, C equals
430:37 - negative two. I can go if I go ahead, and
that doesn't make any of my denominators zero.
430:44 - So if I haven't made any mistakes, it should
satisfy my original equation, but, but I'll
430:49 - just plug it in to be sure. And after some
simplifying, I get a true statement. So my
430:57 - final answer is C equals negative two. In
this video, we solved a couple of rational
431:02 - equations, using the method of finding the
least common denominator, and then clearing
431:08 - the denominator, we cleared the denominator
by multiplying both sides of the equation
431:13 - by the least common denominator or equivalently.
multiplying each of the terms by that denominator.
431:21 - There's another equivalent method that some
people prefer, it still starts out the same,
431:26 - we find the least common denominator, but
then we write all the fractions over that
431:31 - least common denominator. So in this example,
we'd still use the least common denominator
431:36 - of x plus three times x.
431:38 - cancel out the denominators, the whole point
of multiplying by the least common denominator,
431:44 - you're multiplying by something that's big
enough to kill every single denominator so
431:49 - you don't have to deal with denominators anymore.
Now I'm going to simplify by multiplying out.
431:55 - So I get, let's see, c plus one times four
c, that's four c squared plus four c, now
432:02 - I get minus just c minus five, and then over
here, I get three c squared plus three, I
432:09 - can rewrite the minus quantity c minus five
as a minus c plus five. And now I can subtract
432:14 - the three c squared from both sides to get
just a C squared over here, and the four c
432:18 - minus c, that becomes a three C. And finally,
I can subtract the three from both sides to
432:25 - get c squared plus three c plus two equals
zero. got myself a quadratic equation that
432:30 - looks like a nice one that factors. So this
factors to C plus one times c plus two equals
432:36 - zero. So either c plus one is zero, or C plus
two is zero, so C equals negative one, or
432:45 - C equals negative two. Now let's see, we need
to still check our answers. Without even going
432:49 - to the trouble of calculating anything, I
can see that C equals negative one is not
432:56 - going to work, because if I plug it in to
this denominator here, I get a denominator
433:03 - of zero, which doesn't make sense. So C equals
minus one is an extraneous solution, it doesn't
433:11 - actually satisfy my original equation. And
so I can just cross it right out, C equals
433:19 - negative two. I can go if I go ahead, and
that doesn't make any of my denominators zero.
433:24 - So if I haven't made any mistakes, it should
satisfy my original equation, but, but I'll
433:30 - just plug it in to be sure. And after some
simplifying, I get a true statement. So my
433:37 - final answer is C equals negative two. In
this video, we solved a couple of rational
433:44 - equations, using the method of finding the
least common denominator, and then clearing
433:49 - the denominator, we cleared the denominator
by multiplying both sides of the equation
433:55 - by the least common denominator or equivalently.
multiplying each of the terms by that denominator.
434:00 - There's another equivalent method that some
people prefer, it still starts out the same,
434:05 - we find the least common denominator, but
then we write all the fractions over that
434:16 - least common denominator. So in this example,
we'd still use the least common denominator
434:20 - of x plus three times x.
434:22 - But our next step would be to write each of
these rational expressions over that common
434:27 - denominator by multiplying the top and the
bottom by the appropriate things. So one,
434:33 - in order to get the common denominator of
x plus 3x, I need to multiply the top and
434:41 - the bottom by x plus three times x, whenever
x, I need to multiply the top and the bottom
434:47 - just by x plus three since that's what's missing
from the denominator x. Now, if I simplify
434:56 - a little bit, let's say this is x squared
over that common denominator, and here I have
435:06 - just x plus three times x over that denominator,
and here I have x plus three over that common
435:13 - denominator. Now add together my fractions
on the right side, so they have a common denominator.
435:18 - So this is x plus three times x plus x plus
three. And now I have two fractions that have
435:27 - that are equal, that have the same denominator,
therefore, their numerators have to be equal
435:32 - also. So the next step is to set the numerators
equal. So I get x squared is x plus three
435:41 - times x plus x plus three. And if you look
back at the previous way, we solve this equation,
435:48 - you'll recognize this equation. And so from
here on we just continue as before. When choosing
435:52 - between these two methods, I personally tend
to prefer the clear the denominators method,
435:58 - because it's a little bit less writing, you
don't have to get rid of those denominators
436:05 - earlier. You don't have to write them as many
times, but some people find this one a little
436:11 - bit easier to remember, a little easier to
understand either of these methods is fine.
436:18 - One last caution. Don't forget at the end,
to check your solutions and eliminate any
436:25 - extraneous solutions. These will be solutions
that make the denominators of your original
436:30 - equation. Go to zero. This video gives the
derivative of sine cosine and other trig functions.
436:36 - A graph of the function y equals sine x is
given in blue here, we can estimate the shape
436:42 - of the derivative of sine x by looking at
the slopes of the tangent lines. Here, when
436:47 - x equals zero, the tangent line has a positive
slope of approximately one. As x increases
436:52 - to pi over two, the slope of the tangent line
is still positive, but decreases to zero.
436:58 - Next, the slope turns negative more and more
negative reaching a negative value of negative
437:01 - one, before returning again to zero. Continuing
like this, we see that the graph of the derivative
437:06 - y equals sine prime of x looks like the graph
of y equals cosine x below. Please pause the
437:13 - video and do a similar exercise for the graph
of y equals cosine of x below, that is use
437:21 - the graph of y equals cosine x to estimate
the shape of the graph of y equals cosine
437:28 - prime of x. Notice that when x equals zero,
the slope of the tangent line here is zero,
437:34 - that slope turns negative, and then reaches
zero again before turning positive. So the
437:39 - graph of the derivative should look something
like this. This new blue graph looks like
437:44 - the vertical reflection of the blue graph
above suggesting that the derivative of cosine
437:48 - of x is equal to the negative of sine of x.
So we have graphical evidence that the derivative
437:56 - of sine x is equal to cosine of x, and the
derivative of cosine of x is equal to negative
438:03 - sine of x. For proofs of these facts, please
see the separate proof video for this section.
438:09 - Once we have the derivatives of sine and cosine,
we have the power to compute the derivatives
438:16 - of a lot of other trig functions as well.
438:20 - But our next step would be to write each of
these rational expressions over that common

438:32 - in order to get the common denominator of

from the denominator x. Now, if I simplify
438:49 - a little bit, let's say this is x squared
over that common denominator, and here I have
438:52 - just x plus three times x over that denominator,
and here I have x plus three over that common
439:00 - denominator. Now add together my fractions
on the right side, so they have a common denominator.
439:05 - So this is x plus three times x plus x plus
three. And now I have two fractions that have
439:12 - that are equal, that have the same denominator,
therefore, their numerators have to be equal
439:17 - also. So the next step is to set the numerators

442:00 - of sine x is equal to cosine of x, and the
derivative of cosine of x is equal to negative
442:08 - sine of x. For proofs of these facts, please
see the separate proof video for this section.
442:16 - Once we have the derivatives of sine and cosine,
we have the power to compute the derivatives
442:22 - of a lot of other trig functions as well.
442:27 - And notice that a nice way to remember which
of these answers have negative signs in them
442:34 - is that the derivatives of the trig functions
that start with a co
442:38 - And notice that a nice way to remember which
of these answers have negative signs in them
442:45 - is that the derivatives of the trig functions
that start with a co
442:49 - always have a negative, and the root of the
trig functions that don't have the ko are
442:54 - positive. Now let's use these formulas in
an example. g of x is a complicated expression
442:58 - involving several trig functions as well as
a constant m, and I have a couple choices
443:03 - of how to proceed. I could try to rewrite
all my trig functions in terms of sine and
443:10 - cosine and simplify, or I could attack the
derivative directly using the quotient rule.
443:16 - I'm going to use the direct approach In this
case, but sometimes you'll find that rewriting
443:24 - will make things easier. So using the quotient
rule on the denominator, I get the original
443:28 - denominator squared. On the numerator, I get
low D high to compute the derivative of x
443:33 - cosine x, I need the product rule. So I get
x times the derivative of cosine, which is
443:40 - negative sine x, plus the derivative of x,
which is just one times cosine of x. Now I
443:48 - have to do a minus Hi, x cosine of x dillow.
The derivative of M is just zero because M
443:56 - is a constant, plus the derivative of cotangent
which is negative cosecant squared of x. So
444:01 - I found the derivative, I'm going to go ahead
and simplify a little bit by multiplying out
444:05 - then rewriting everything in terms of sine
and cosine, and then multiplying the numerator
444:13 - and denominator by sine squared of x, we have
a somewhat simplified expression for the derivative,
444:17 - you should memorize the derivatives of the
trig functions will prove that the first two
444:22 - formulas are correct in a separate proof video.
In this video, I'll give proofs for the two
444:30 - special trig limit. And I'll also prove that
the derivative of sine is cosine. And the
444:34 - derivative of cosine is minus sign. To prove
that the limit of sine that over theta is
444:41 - one as theta goes to zero, I'm going to start
with a picture. In this picture, I have a
444:49 - unit circle a circle of radius one, and I
have two right triangles, a green triangle
444:53 - and a smaller red triangle, both with angle
theta. Now I'm going to argue in terms of
444:58 - areas, if I want to compute the area of this
sector that I've shaded in blue here, in other
445:08 - words, that pie shaped piece, I can first
compute the area of the circle, which is pi
445:16 - times one squared for the radius. But since
the sector has angle theta, and the full circle
445:24 - has angle two pi, I need to multiply that
area of the circle by the ratio theta over
445:30 - two pi to represent the fraction of the area
of the circle that's included in this sector.
445:40 - So in other words, the area of the sector
is just going to be theta over two, where
445:49 - theta is given in the radians. Now if I want
to compute the area of the little red triangle,
445:57 - I can do one half times the base times the
height. Now the base is going to be equal
446:15 - to cosine theta, because I have a circle of
radius one angle theta here, and the height
446:22 - is going to be sine theta. Finally, the area
of the green triangle is also one half times
446:31 - the base times the height. But now the base
is a full one unit, and the height is given
446:38 - by tangent theta, since opposite, which is
the height here over adjacent, which is one
446:43 - has to equal tangent theta. Now if I put all
those areas together, I know that the area
446:53 - of the red triangle, alright is cosine theta
sine theta over two has to be less than or
447:04 - equal to the area of the blue sector, theta
over two, which is less than or equal to the
447:14 - area of the big green triangle, which is tan
theta over two. Now I'm going to multiply
447:22 - through this inequality by two and rewrite
things in terms of sine and cosine to get
447:28 - cosine theta sine theta is less than or equal
to theta is less than or equal to sine theta
447:37 - over cosine theta. Now I'm going to divide
through my inequalities by sine theta, which
447:41 - won't change the inequalities as long as theta
is greater than zero, so that sine theta is
447:48 - positive.
447:49 - always have a negative, and the root of the
trig functions that don't have the ko are
447:53 - positive. Now let's use these formulas in
an example. g of x is a complicated expression
447:57 - involving several trig functions as well as
a constant m, and I have a couple choices
448:03 - of how to proceed. I could try to rewrite
all my trig functions in terms of sine and
448:06 - cosine and simplify, or I could attack the
derivative directly using the quotient rule.
448:09 - I'm going to use the direct approach In this

448:12 - will make things easier. So using the quotient
rule on the denominator, I get the original
448:18 - denominator squared. On the numerator, I get

x times the derivative of cosine, which is

449:52 - unit circle a circle of radius one, and I
have two right triangles, a green triangle
449:57 - and a smaller red triangle, both with angle
theta. Now I'm going to argue in terms of
450:00 - areas, if I want to compute the area of this
sector that I've shaded in blue here, in other
450:06 - words, that pie shaped piece, I can first
compute the area of the circle, which is pi
450:11 - times one squared for the radius. But since
the sector has angle theta, and the full circle
450:18 - has angle two pi, I need to multiply that
area of the circle by the ratio theta over
450:26 - two pi to represent the fraction of the area
of the circle that's included in this sector.
450:31 - So in other words, the area of the sector
is just going to be theta over two, where

of the green triangle is also one half times

is a full one unit, and the height is given
451:14 - by tangent theta, since opposite, which is
the height here over adjacent, which is one
451:20 - has to equal tangent theta. Now if I put all
those areas together, I know that the area
451:32 - of the red triangle, alright is cosine theta
sine theta over two has to be less than or
451:42 - equal to the area of the blue sector, theta
over two, which is less than or equal to the
451:46 - area of the big green triangle, which is tan
theta over two. Now I'm going to multiply
452:00 - through this inequality by two and rewrite
things in terms of sine and cosine to get
452:08 - cosine theta sine theta is less than or equal
to theta is less than or equal to sine theta
452:17 - over cosine theta. Now I'm going to divide
through my inequalities by sine theta, which
452:22 - won't change the inequalities as long as theta
is greater than zero, so that sine theta is
452:32 - positive.
452:33 - And I get cosine theta is less than or equal
to theta over sine theta is less than or equal
452:45 - to one over cosine theta. Now this middle
expression is the reciprocal of the expression
453:02 - I want to take the limit of. So I'm going
to go ahead and take limits. And since the
453:08 - limits of the two expressions on the outside,
both exist, and equal one by the sandwich
453:19 - theorem, the limit of the expression on the
inside has to exist an equal one as well.
453:30 - Now I've cheated a little bit here. And I've
really just taken the limit from the right
453:39 - because I've assumed that theta is greater
than zero. But you can check that if you say
453:45 - that less than zero, so that sign that as
negative, the limit from the left will also
453:54 - equal one, the inequalities will flip around
first, but you'll still get it use the sandwich
454:04 - theorem to get a limit of one. And that's
a cool geometric proof of this useful limit
454:12 - from calculus. To show that the limit of cosine
theta minus one over theta is zero, we can
454:15 - actually rewrite this expression and reuse
the limit that we just computed. So let me
454:22 - write down my limit. And I'm going to multiply
this expression by cosine theta plus one on
454:27 - the numerator and the denominator. So I haven't
changed the expression, I'm just multiply
454:33 - that by one. Now, if I multiply my numerator
out,
454:35 - And I get cosine theta is less than or equal
to theta over sine theta is less than or equal
454:42 - to one over cosine theta. Now this middle
expression is the reciprocal of the expression
454:48 - I want to take the limit of. So I'm going
to go ahead and take limits. And since the
454:54 - limits of the two expressions on the outside,
both exist, and equal one by the sandwich
455:00 - theorem, the limit of the expression on the
inside has to exist an equal one as well.
455:06 - Now I've cheated a little bit here. And I've
really just taken the limit from the right
455:13 - because I've assumed that theta is greater
than zero. But you can check that if you say
455:16 - that less than zero, so that sign that as
negative, the limit from the left will also
455:23 - equal one, the inequalities will flip around
first, but you'll still get it use the sandwich
455:30 - theorem to get a limit of one. And that's
a cool geometric proof of this useful limit
455:35 - from calculus. To show that the limit of cosine
theta minus one over theta is zero, we can
455:43 - actually rewrite this expression and reuse
the limit that we just computed. So let me
455:51 - write down my limit. And I'm going to multiply
this expression by cosine theta plus one on
455:56 - the numerator and the denominator. So I haven't
changed the expression, I'm just multiply
456:01 - that by one. Now, if I multiply my numerator
out,
456:06 - I get cosine squared theta minus one. And
from the trig identity, sine squared theta
456:12 - plus cosine squared theta equals one, I know
that cosine squared theta minus one has to
456:19 - equal minus sine squared. So I can rewrite
my limit as the limit of minus sine squared
456:27 - theta over theta cosine theta plus one. And
now I can regroup to write my sine theta over
456:35 - theta, and my other copy of sine theta over
cosine theta plus one, the limit of the first
456:41 - expression is going to be negative one, because
of the limit we just proved. And the limit
456:48 - of the second expression is just zero over
one plus one, or zero, and therefore, my entire
456:58 - limit is just going to be negative one times
zero, or zero, which is exactly what we want
457:12 - it to prove. Now we can use these two limits
that we've just proved to calculate the derivatives
457:19 - of sine and cosine, using the limit definition
of derivative and prove the results that were
457:24 - stated previously. According to the limit
definition of derivative, the derivative of
457:32 - sine x is the limit as h goes to zero of sine
of x plus h minus sine of x divided by H.
457:41 - As usual, this is a zero for zero indeterminate
form limits. So I'm going to need to rewrite
457:53 - things to evaluate it. And I'm going to rewrite
using the angle sum formula for sine, the
458:01 - sine of x plus h is equal to sine x cosine
H, cosine plus cosine x sine H. Now if I rearrange
458:13 - things, and factor out a sine x from the first
term, I can break up my limit into pieces
458:20 - and compute every piece. So this is sine x
times zero plus cosine x times one. And so
458:28 - my final answer is cosine x as we wanted the
proof that the derivative of cosine is minus
458:36 - sine is very similar. So please stop the video
and try it for yourself before proceeding.
458:42 - Using the limit definition of derivative,
we have that the derivative of cosine of x
458:48 - is the limit as h goes to zero of cosine of
x plus h minus cosine of x over h, we can
458:55 - rewrite the cosine of x plus h using the angle
sum formula as the cosine of x times the cosine
459:03 - of H minus the sine of x times the sine of
H. And then we still have the minus cosine
459:11 - of x over h. As before, we're going to regroup
things and factoring out the cosine x from
459:18 - the first part, the same familiar limits just
put together in different ways. So here, cosine
459:24 - of x as h goes to zero is just cosine of x.
This limit we know is zero. sine of x is just
459:31 - saying sine of x, and sine of h over h is
going to one which means that our final answer
459:41 - is going to be negative sine of x times one
or just negative sine of x, which is exactly
459:51 - what we wanted. That's all for the proofs
of these four useful calculus facts. rectilinear
459:58 - motion or linear motion means the motion of
an object along a straight line. For example,
460:05 - a particle moving left and right, or a ball
going up and down. In this video, we'll see
460:17 - what the derivative and the second derivative
tell us about the motion of an object constrained
460:26 - to move along a straight line. In this example,
A particle is moving up and down along a straight
460:35 - line. And its position is given by this equation
where the positive positions mean that the
460:43 - particle is above its Baseline Position, whatever
I'm calling position zero, and negative positions
460:48 - mean the particle is below this Baseline Position.
I'm asked to find s prime of T and S double
460:54 - prime of t. So by deriving I get four t cubed
minus 16 t squared plus 12 T for the first
461:02 - derivative, and 12 t squared minus 32 t plus
12. For the second derivative,
461:08 - I get cosine squared theta minus one. And
from the trig identity, sine squared theta
461:13 - plus cosine squared theta equals one, I know
that cosine squared theta minus one has to
461:19 - equal minus sine squared. So I can rewrite
my limit as the limit of minus sine squared
461:27 - theta over theta cosine theta plus one. And
now I can regroup to write my sine theta over
461:37 - theta, and my other copy of sine theta over
cosine theta plus one, the limit of the first
461:44 - expression is going to be negative one, because
of the limit we just proved. And the limit
461:49 - of the second expression is just zero over
one plus one, or zero, and therefore, my entire
461:53 - limit is just going to be negative one times
zero, or zero, which is exactly what we want
462:02 - it to prove. Now we can use these two limits
that we've just proved to calculate the derivatives
462:11 - of sine and cosine, using the limit definition
of derivative and prove the results that were
462:18 - stated previously. According to the limit
definition of derivative, the derivative of
462:22 - sine x is the limit as h goes to zero of sine
of x plus h minus sine of x divided by H.
462:29 - As usual, this is a zero for zero indeterminate
form limits. So I'm going to need to rewrite
462:37 - things to evaluate it. And I'm going to rewrite
using the angle sum formula for sine, the
462:45 - sine of x plus h is equal to sine x cosine
H, cosine plus cosine x sine H. Now if I rearrange
462:53 - things, and factor out a sine x from the first
term, I can break up my limit into pieces
463:02 - and compute every piece. So this is sine x
times zero plus cosine x times one. And so
463:10 - my final answer is cosine x as we wanted the
proof that the derivative of cosine is minus
463:16 - sine is very similar. So please stop the video
and try it for yourself before proceeding.
463:21 - Using the limit definition of derivative,
we have that the derivative of cosine of x
463:26 - is the limit as h goes to zero of cosine of
x plus h minus cosine of x over h, we can
463:34 - rewrite the cosine of x plus h using the angle
sum formula as the cosine of x times the cosine
463:41 - of H minus the sine of x times the sine of
H. And then we still have the minus cosine
463:50 - of x over h. As before, we're going to regroup
things and factoring out the cosine x from
463:59 - the first part, the same familiar limits just
put together in different ways. So here, cosine
464:06 - of x as h goes to zero is just cosine of x.
This limit we know is zero. sine of x is just
464:15 - saying sine of x, and sine of h over h is
going to one which means that our final answer
464:30 - is going to be negative sine of x times one
or just negative sine of x, which is exactly
464:40 - what we wanted. That's all for the proofs
of these four useful calculus facts. rectilinear
464:45 - motion or linear motion means the motion of
an object along a straight line. For example,
464:51 - a particle moving left and right, or a ball
going up and down. In this video, we'll see
464:56 - what the derivative and the second derivative
tell us about the motion of an object constrained
465:03 - to move along a straight line. In this example,
A particle is moving up and down along a straight
465:10 - line. And its position is given by this equation
where the positive positions mean that the
465:16 - particle is above its Baseline Position, whatever
I'm calling position zero, and negative positions
465:21 - mean the particle is below this Baseline Position.
I'm asked to find s prime of T and S double
465:28 - prime of t. So by deriving I get four t cubed
minus 16 t squared plus 12 T for the first
465:36 - derivative, and 12 t squared minus 32 t plus
12. For the second derivative,
465:42 - S prime of t, which can also be written, D
STD represents the instantaneous rate of change
465:49 - of S of t, the position over time, well, the
change in position over time is just the velocity.
465:55 - And this can also be written as v of t, s
double prime of t, the second derivative of
466:06 - s with respect to t, can also be thought of
as the derivative of the velocity function.
466:16 - So that represents the rate of change of velocity
over time, how fast the velocity is increasing
466:27 - or decreasing. And that is called acceleration.
And it can be written as a lefty. Like position,
466:39 - velocity and acceleration can be both positive
and negative. A positive velocity means the
466:45 - position is increasing. So the particle is
moving up, while a negative velocity means
466:51 - the position is decreasing, so the particle
is moving down. Of course, a velocity of zero
466:58 - means the particles at rest, at least for
that instant. from physics, we know that force
467:05 - equals mass times acceleration. So if the
acceleration is positive, then that means
467:11 - the force is in the positive direction, it's
like the particle is being pulled up. If on
467:15 - the other hand, the acceleration is negative
than the force is in the negative direction,
467:22 - and it's like the particle is being pulled
down. an acceleration of zero means there's
467:28 - no force on the particle at that instant,
and the velocity continues as is. Let's use
467:33 - these ideas about velocity acceleration. And
the following table of values to describe
467:37 - the particles motion at time equals 1.5 seconds.
At time 1.5 seconds, the position of the particle
467:45 - is positive, so that means the particle is
above its Baseline Position of zero. its velocity
467:53 - is negative, so that means that its position
is decreasing. In other words, the particle
468:01 - is moving down. Its acceleration is negative
acceleration is the derivative of velocity.
468:07 - So a negative acceleration means the velocity
is decreasing. Well, a negative velocity that's
468:13 - decreasing is getting more and more negative.
So in fact, the particle is moving down faster
468:18 - and faster. This can be a little bit confusing,
because even though the velocity is decreasing,
468:25 - it's getting more and more negative, the speed,
which is the absolute value of velocity is
468:31 - increasing. We can also see what the particle
is doing at 1.5 seconds by looking at this
468:36 - graph, where the time is drawn on the x axis
and position s of t is on the y axis. From
468:49 - the graph, we can see that when t is zero,
S of t is also zero. So the particle starts
468:56 - at its Baseline Position of zero. At time
1.5 seconds, the particle is above this starting
469:04 - position, but moving downwards. And since
the slope of this graph is getting steeper
469:09 - and steeper, we can conclude that the speed
of the particle is increasing. Same thing
469:13 - was we concluded from the table of values.
Now let's do the same analysis when time is
469:18 - 2.5 seconds. s of 2.5 seconds is negative.
So the particle is below its starting position.
469:24 - Velocity s prime of t is also negative. So
the particle is still going down. But now
469:29 - the acceleration as double prime of t is positive.
That means that the velocity Today is increasing,
469:38 - well, a negative velocity that's increasing
is getting less negative closer to zero. So
469:41 - the particle must be slowing down. And in
fact, the speed is decreasing. Again, the
469:46 - graph agrees with this reasoning, at 2.5 seconds,
our position is way down here, our graph is
469:50 - decreasing, so the particles moving down,
and the slope seems to be leveling off. So
469:54 - the particle speed is decreasing. Even though
it's velocity,
469:59 - S prime of t, which can also be written, D
STD represents the instantaneous rate of change
470:10 - of S of t, the position over time, well, the
change in position over time is just the velocity.
470:20 - And this can also be written as v of t, s
double prime of t, the second derivative of
470:32 - s with respect to t, can also be thought of
as the derivative of the velocity function.
470:44 - So that represents the rate of change of velocity
over time, how fast the velocity is increasing
470:57 - or decreasing. And that is called acceleration.
And it can be written as a lefty. Like position,
471:12 - velocity and acceleration can be both positive
and negative. A positive velocity means the
471:21 - position is increasing. So the particle is
moving up, while a negative velocity means
471:32 - the position is decreasing, so the particle
is moving down. Of course, a velocity of zero
471:38 - means the particles at rest, at least for
that instant. from physics, we know that force
471:40 - equals mass times acceleration. So if the
acceleration is positive, then that means
471:46 - the force is in the positive direction, it's
like the particle is being pulled up. If on
471:51 - the other hand, the acceleration is negative
than the force is in the negative direction,
471:57 - and it's like the particle is being pulled
down. an acceleration of zero means there's
471:59 - no force on the particle at that instant,
and the velocity continues as is. Let's use
472:07 - these ideas about velocity acceleration. And
the following table of values to describe
472:12 - the particles motion at time equals 1.5 seconds.
At time 1.5 seconds, the position of the particle
472:19 - is positive, so that means the particle is
above its Baseline Position of zero. its velocity
472:25 - is negative, so that means that its position
is decreasing. In other words, the particle
472:31 - is moving down. Its acceleration is negative
acceleration is the derivative of velocity.
472:37 - So a negative acceleration means the velocity
is decreasing. Well, a negative velocity that's
472:44 - decreasing is getting more and more negative.
So in fact, the particle is moving down faster
472:50 - and faster. This can be a little bit confusing,
because even though the velocity is decreasing,
473:00 - it's getting more and more negative, the speed,
which is the absolute value of velocity is
473:08 - increasing. We can also see what the particle
is doing at 1.5 seconds by looking at this
473:13 - graph, where the time is drawn on the x axis
and position s of t is on the y axis. From
473:24 - the graph, we can see that when t is zero,
S of t is also zero. So the particle starts
473:31 - at its Baseline Position of zero. At time
1.5 seconds, the particle is above this starting
473:41 - position, but moving downwards. And since
the slope of this graph is getting steeper
473:49 - and steeper, we can conclude that the speed
of the particle is increasing. Same thing
473:55 - was we concluded from the table of values.
Now let's do the same analysis when time is
474:01 - 2.5 seconds. s of 2.5 seconds is negative.
So the particle is below its starting position.
474:09 - Velocity s prime of t is also negative. So
the particle is still going down. But now
474:16 - the acceleration as double prime of t is positive.
That means that the velocity Today is increasing,
474:20 - well, a negative velocity that's increasing
is getting less negative closer to zero. So
474:28 - the particle must be slowing down. And in
fact, the speed is decreasing. Again, the
474:33 - graph agrees with this reasoning, at 2.5 seconds,
our position is way down here, our graph is
474:39 - decreasing, so the particles moving down,
and the slope seems to be leveling off. So
474:49 - the particle speed is decreasing. Even though
it's velocity,
474:53 - which you can think of as speed with direction
is increasing, simply because it's a negative
475:02 - velocity that's getting less negative. Notice
that in the first example, when velocity and
475:08 - acceleration are both in the same direction,
that is, they're both negative the particle
475:16 - was speeding up. And the second example, were
velocity and acceleration when the opposite
475:24 - directions one positive one negative, the
particle is slowing down.
475:27 - which you can think of as speed with direction
is increasing, simply because it's a negative
475:32 - velocity that's getting less negative. Notice
that in the first example, when velocity and
475:36 - acceleration are both in the same direction,
that is, they're both negative the particle
475:41 - was speeding up. And the second example, were
velocity and acceleration when the opposite
475:49 - directions one positive one negative, the
particle is slowing down.
475:55 - This is true in general, when velocity acceleration
had the same sign, that as they're both positive
476:05 - or both negative, then the particle is speeding
up.
476:10 - This is true in general, when velocity acceleration
had the same sign, that as they're both positive
476:18 - or both negative, then the particle is speeding
up.
476:22 - And when velocity acceleration have opposite
signs, then the particle is slowing down.
476:29 - One way to think about this is in terms of
force, forces in the same direction as acceleration.
476:39 - So if velocity acceleration have the same
sign, that means force is the same direction
476:46 - as the particles already going, so it's making
the particle speed up. But if velocity and
476:53 - acceleration have opposite signs, then the
force is going against the way that particles
477:00 - moving, so it's causing it to slow down. Let's
continue the same example with some more questions,
477:05 - it'll be helpful to write down the velocity
and acceleration functions that we calculated
477:09 - earlier. I've also graphed position, velocity
and acceleration here at the right. And before
477:18 - you go on, it's a fun exercise to figure out
which one is which, without even looking at
477:19 - the equations just based on the shapes of
the graphs. And where they're increasing where
477:29 - they're decreasing where they're positive
and where they're negative. Velocity is the
477:33 - derivative of position. So velocity needs
to be positive, where position is increasing.
477:40 - The only pairs of functions that have this
property are the blue one, that's positive,
477:44 - when the red ones increasing, and the green
function, which is positive, when the blue
477:51 - one is increasing. Now acceleration, which
is the derivative of velocity also needs to
477:58 - be positive, when velocity is increasing.
So the only way to correctly label the functions
478:04 - with both of these relationships is to make
the red one be position, the blue one be velocity,
478:09 - and the green one be acceleration. This agrees
with the equations that
478:12 - And when velocity acceleration have opposite
signs, then the particle is slowing down.
478:18 - One way to think about this is in terms of
force, forces in the same direction as acceleration.
478:28 - So if velocity acceleration have the same
sign, that means force is the same direction
478:36 - as the particles already going, so it's making
the particle speed up. But if velocity and
478:44 - acceleration have opposite signs, then the
force is going against the way that particles
478:50 - moving, so it's causing it to slow down. Let's
continue the same example with some more questions,
478:55 - it'll be helpful to write down the velocity
and acceleration functions that we calculated
479:02 - earlier. I've also graphed position, velocity
and acceleration here at the right. And before
479:08 - you go on, it's a fun exercise to figure out
which one is which, without even looking at
479:16 - the equations just based on the shapes of
the graphs. And where they're increasing where
479:24 - they're decreasing where they're positive
and where they're negative. Velocity is the
479:33 - derivative of position. So velocity needs
to be positive, where position is increasing.
479:42 - The only pairs of functions that have this
property are the blue one, that's positive,
479:51 - when the red ones increasing, and the green
function, which is positive, when the blue
480:00 - one is increasing. Now acceleration, which
is the derivative of velocity also needs to
480:09 - be positive, when velocity is increasing.
So the only way to correctly label the functions
480:20 - with both of these relationships is to make
the red one be position, the blue one be velocity,
480:38 - and the green one be acceleration. This agrees
with the equations that
480:43 - we have over here.
480:44 - we have over here.
480:46 - The first question asks, When is the particle
at rest, the particle is temporarily at rest
480:50 - when the velocity is zero. In other words,
S prime of t is zero. So plugging in the equation
481:00 - for S prime of t, we can factor out a four
T, and factor some more. To conclude the T
481:07 - has to be 01, or three.
481:09 - The first question asks, When is the particle
at rest, the particle is temporarily at rest
481:18 - when the velocity is zero. In other words,
S prime of t is zero. So plugging in the equation
481:27 - for S prime of t, we can factor out a four
T, and factor some more. To conclude the T
481:39 - has to be 01, or three.
481:42 - This conclusion agrees with our graph of V
of t, which has x intercepts at 01 and three,
481:53 - and also agrees with our graph of position
s of t. Since the particle stops for a moment,
481:59 - it changed direction, when t equals 01. And
three, the particle is moving up when velocity
482:06 - is positive, and moving down when velocity
is negative. Since we know from the previous
482:13 - question, the velocity equals zero, when t
equals 01. And three, we can look in between
482:18 - those values to figure out whether the velocity
is positive or negative, just by plugging
482:23 - in values. So for example, when t is negative
one, if I plug into the negative one to the
482:32 - equation for velocity, I get a negative number.
So velocity must be negative when t is less
482:39 - than zero, between zero and one. If I plug
in, for example, t equals one half, I get
482:45 - a value of S prime of t or V of t of 2.5,
which is a positive number. If I plug in a
482:55 - value of t in between one and three, say t
equals two, I get a value of v of t of negative
483:02 - eight, which is a negative number. And finally,
if I plug in a value of t greater than three,
483:08 - so For, I get a positive answer for V of t.
So from the sign chart, I see that V of t
483:14 - is negative when t is between negative infinity
and zero, and in between one and three, and
483:22 - V of t is positive when t is between
483:26 - This conclusion agrees with our graph of V
of t, which has x intercepts at 01 and three,
483:31 - and also agrees with our graph of position
s of t. Since the particle stops for a moment,
483:40 - it changed direction, when t equals 01. And
three, the particle is moving up when velocity
483:45 - is positive, and moving down when velocity
is negative. Since we know from the previous
483:52 - question, the velocity equals zero, when t
equals 01. And three, we can look in between
483:58 - those values to figure out whether the velocity
is positive or negative, just by plugging
484:08 - in values. So for example, when t is negative
one, if I plug into the negative one to the
484:21 - equation for velocity, I get a negative number.
So velocity must be negative when t is less
484:26 - than zero, between zero and one. If I plug
in, for example, t equals one half, I get
484:32 - a value of S prime of t or V of t of 2.5,
which is a positive number. If I plug in a
484:39 - value of t in between one and three, say t
equals two, I get a value of v of t of negative
484:46 - eight, which is a negative number. And finally,
if I plug in a value of t greater than three,
484:57 - so For, I get a positive answer for V of t.
So from the sign chart, I see that V of t
485:06 - is negative when t is between negative infinity
and zero, and in between one and three, and
485:14 - V of t is positive when t is between
485:18 - zero and
485:19 - zero and
485:20 - one, and between three and infinity. Of course,
I could have reached the same conclusion just
485:26 - by looking at the graph of velocity and where
it's above and below the x axis, or even by
485:36 - looking at the graph of position and seeing
where it's increasing and where it's decreasing.
485:40 - To answer the next question, the particle
will be speeding up when V of t and a of t
485:49 - are both positive or both negative. And the
particle will be slowing down when V of t
485:57 - and a of t have opposite signs. So let's make
a similar sign chart to figure out where a
486:03 - of t is positive and negative. First, it'll
be helpful to find out where a if t is zero.
486:10 - So if I set zero equal to my S double prime,
that's 12 t squared minus 32 t plus 12, I
486:20 - could factor out
486:21 - one, and between three and infinity. Of course,
I could have reached the same conclusion just
486:26 - by looking at the graph of velocity and where
it's above and below the x axis, or even by
486:33 - looking at the graph of position and seeing
where it's increasing and where it's decreasing.
486:42 - To answer the next question, the particle
will be speeding up when V of t and a of t
486:50 - are both positive or both negative. And the
particle will be slowing down when V of t
486:59 - and a of t have opposite signs. So let's make
a similar sign chart to figure out where a
487:13 - of t is positive and negative. First, it'll
be helpful to find out where a if t is zero.
487:25 - So if I set zero equal to my S double prime,
that's 12 t squared minus 32 t plus 12, I
487:39 - could factor out
487:41 - a four
487:42 - a four
487:43 - and then use the quadratic equation to find
the solution. Since this equation doesn't
487:50 - factor easily, this simplifies to four thirds
plus or minus the square root of seven over
487:56 - three, which is approximately 0.45, and 2.22.
Now I can build a similar sign chart for acceleration,
488:03 - mark the places where acceleration is zero.
and plug in values of t, say t equals zero
488:10 - is the equation for acceleration, I get a
positive answer here. When I plug in, say
488:16 - t equals one, I get a negative answer here.
And when I plug in, say, t equals three, I
488:24 - get another positive answer here. Now, if
I put this together with my velocity chart,
488:30 - which changed sign at 01, and three, and went
from negative to positive, to negative to
488:37 - positive, I can try to figure out where velocity
acceleration both have the same sign. It might
488:44 - be helpful actually to shade in where acceleration
is positive. And separately shade in where
488:50 - velocity is positive. And then look for the
places where both are shaded. So between zero
488:58 - and 4.5, and greater than three. And then
I can also look where both are unshaded that
489:11 - looks like in between one and 2.22. So that's
where they're both negative. And then I'll
489:17 - know that V of t and a of t have opposite
signs everywhere else. A slightly better answer,
489:24 - we'll use exact values of four thirds plus
or minus squared of seven thirds instead of
489:32 - these decimal approximations. So let me write
that down. So here is where the particle speeding
489:40 - up. And here, it's where it's slowing down,
we can check our work by looking at the graph
489:46 - of position, the particle speeding up with
the position graph is getting steeper and
489:51 - steeper, that's the red graph is getting steeper
and steeper here, here. And here, just like
489:58 - we found algebraically. As our final example,
let's look at net change in position and distance
490:04 - traveled between one and four seconds for
the same particle. At time, one second position
490:09 - is five thirds, or about 1.67 millimeters
at time for its position is given by 32 thirds,
490:16 - or about 10.67 millimeters, all I'm doing
is plugging one and four into this equation.
490:26 - So the net change in position is just the
difference of these two numbers. As a four
490:37 - minus as of one, which is nine millimeters.
At first glance, it might seem like the total
490:42 - distance traveled between one and four seconds
should also be nine millimeters, but actually,
490:48 - it's a little more complicated. Because the
particle switches direction during that time
490:53 - period, it doesn't go straight from its position
at one second to its position at four seconds.
491:02 - Remember what the graph Position looked like
the particle switches direction at one second
491:08 - and at three seconds. So to find the total
distance, we need the distance of travels
491:17 - from one second to three seconds, plus the
distance that travels from three seconds to
491:26 - four seconds. Another way of thinking about
this is that we need the absolute value of
491:37 - s three minus s one, plus the absolute value
of s four minus s three, we need these absolute
491:52 - value signs because this difference in position
will be negative instead of positive when
491:59 - the particles moving down. Plugging in the
t values into our equation, we get negative
492:06 - 27 minus five thirds, plus the absolute value
of 32 thirds minus negative 27, which is a
492:13 - total of 199 thirds, or 66.3 repeating millimeters,
quite a bit more than the nine millimeter
492:19 - difference in position. This video gave an
in depth analysis of a particle moving up
492:23 - and down along a straight
492:25 - and then use the quadratic equation to find
the solution. Since this equation doesn't
492:27 - factor easily, this simplifies to four thirds
plus or minus the square root of seven over
492:32 - three, which is approximately 0.45, and 2.22.
Now I can build a similar sign chart for acceleration,
492:39 - mark the places where acceleration is zero.
and plug in values of t, say t equals zero
492:46 - is the equation for acceleration, I get a
positive answer here. When I plug in, say
492:50 - t equals one, I get a negative answer here.
And when I plug in, say, t equals three, I
492:56 - get another positive answer here. Now, if
I put this together with my velocity chart,
493:01 - which changed sign at 01, and three, and went
from negative to positive, to negative to
493:07 - positive, I can try to figure out where velocity
acceleration both have the same sign. It might
493:12 - be helpful actually to shade in where acceleration
is positive. And separately shade in where
493:17 - velocity is positive. And then look for the
places where both are shaded. So between zero
493:22 - and 4.5, and greater than three. And then
I can also look where both are unshaded that
493:27 - looks like in between one and 2.22. So that's
where they're both negative. And then I'll
493:33 - know that V of t and a of t have opposite
signs everywhere else. A slightly better answer,
493:41 - we'll use exact values of four thirds plus
or minus squared of seven thirds instead of
493:48 - these decimal approximations. So let me write
that down. So here is where the particle speeding
493:55 - up. And here, it's where it's slowing down,
we can check our work by looking at the graph
493:58 - of position, the particle speeding up with
the position graph is getting steeper and
494:02 - steeper, that's the red graph is getting steeper
and steeper here, here. And here, just like
494:05 - we found algebraically. As our final example,
let's look at net change in position and distance
494:10 - traveled between one and four seconds for
the same particle. At time, one second position
494:16 - is five thirds, or about 1.67 millimeters
at time for its position is given by 32 thirds,
494:23 - or about 10.67 millimeters, all I'm doing
is plugging one and four into this equation.
494:29 - So the net change in position is just the
difference of these two numbers. As a four
494:35 - minus as of one, which is nine millimeters.
At first glance, it might seem like the total
494:42 - distance traveled between one and four seconds
should also be nine millimeters, but actually,
494:47 - it's a little more complicated. Because the
particle switches direction during that time
494:52 - period, it doesn't go straight from its position
at one second to its position at four seconds.
494:59 - Remember what the graph Position looked like
the particle switches direction at one second
495:03 - and at three seconds. So to find the total
distance, we need the distance of travels
495:07 - from one second to three seconds, plus the
distance that travels from three seconds to
495:11 - four seconds. Another way of thinking about
this is that we need the absolute value of
495:17 - s three minus s one, plus the absolute value
of s four minus s three, we need these absolute
495:22 - value signs because this difference in position
will be negative instead of positive when
495:28 - the particles moving down. Plugging in the
t values into our equation, we get negative
495:43 - 27 minus five thirds, plus the absolute value
of 32 thirds minus negative 27, which is a
495:48 - total of 199 thirds, or 66.3 repeating millimeters,
quite a bit more than the nine millimeter
495:52 - difference in position. This video gave an
in depth analysis of a particle moving up
495:56 - and down along a straight
495:57 - line.
495:58 - line.
495:59 - A similar analysis could be done for a particle
moving left and right along a straight line,
496:04 - where a positive position means the particles
on the right side, and a negative position
496:10 - means the particles on the left side of his
Baseline Position. Of course, the same analysis
496:15 - can be done for other objects, not just particles.
A typical application is to a ball being thrown
496:21 - straight up and then falling down again. This
video will give an economic application of
496:25 - the derivative to a cost function. Suppose
that the total cost of producing x tie dyed
496:35 - t shirts is C of x.
496:38 - A similar analysis could be done for a particle
moving left and right along a straight line,
496:45 - where a positive position means the particles
on the right side, and a negative position
496:56 - means the particles on the left side of his
Baseline Position. Of course, the same analysis
497:03 - can be done for other objects, not just particles.
A typical application is to a ball being thrown
497:12 - straight up and then falling down again. This
video will give an economic application of
497:18 - the derivative to a cost function. Suppose
that the total cost of producing x tie dyed
497:26 - t shirts is C of x.
497:28 - I'm going to sketch a few graphs, and you
try to decide which graph is the most reasonable
497:35 - representation for C of x. Pause the video
for a moment to think about it. All of these
497:41 - candidate graphs that I've drawn have a nonzero
y intercept, that's meant to reflect the idea
497:44 - that there's some fixed startup cost and buying
equipment before you can even get started.
497:49 - Now, I would like to suggest that C of x should
be an increasing function of x, because it's
497:53 - going to cost more money to make more t shirts,
you need more supplies and labor. So this
498:01 - function is out. Now it's somewhat reasonable,
I think that C of x might be a linear function
498:05 - of x like it is here, if you've got the same
cost per t shirt, whether you make 10 t shirts,
498:13 - or 1000 t shirts, the slope in that case would
represent the cost per t shirt. And the linear
498:18 - function would mean that cost per t shirt
is constant, no matter how many t shirts you're
498:25 - making. But in reality, it's probably going
to be cheaper to make 1000 t shirts than it
498:31 - is to make just a few t shirts. And therefore
the cost per t shirt, sure slope should be
498:39 - going down as x increases. So this function
right here is the one whose slope is going
498:45 - down for larger access. And so I would say
that this is the most reasonable representation
498:50 - for C of x as a function of x. In other words,
C of x should be an increasing function, but
498:57 - C prime of x should be decreasing. C of 204
minus C of 200 represents the additional cost
499:03 - for making 204 t shirts instead of 200. In
formula, you might think of that as the cost
499:11 - of making the last four t shirts. The ratio
C of 200 for a minus C of 200 over four is
499:18 - the average rate of change of C of x. The
units are units of cost, which is probably
499:26 - dollars per t shirt. And formula you might
think of this as the additional cost per t
499:33 - shirt of making the last four t shirts. C
prime of 200 is the instantaneous rate of
499:39 - change of C of x. c of x is known as the cost
function. And C prime of x is called the marginal
499:49 - cost, which is the rate at which cost is increasing
per additional t shirt made. It might seem
499:57 - a little bit weird to take the derivative
of C of x since x can really only take on
500:03 - integer values. But we can always approximate
C of x with a function whose domain is all
500:12 - real numbers. To make this a little more specific,
let's use a cost function of C of x equals
500:19 - 500 plus 300 times the square root of x. In
this example, x is supposed to be the number
500:25 - of iPads that are produced, and C of x is
the cost of producing them in dollars. Then
500:29 - C of 401 minus C of 400. given by 500 plus
300, times the square root of 401 minus 500
500:36 - plus 300 times the square root of 400. This
simplifies to $7.50, rounded to the nearest
500:40 - cent. This means that it costs an additional
$7.50 to go from producing 400 iPads to 401
500:48 - iPad. In this fictitious example,
500:49 - I'm going to sketch a few graphs, and you
try to decide which graph is the most reasonable
500:56 - representation for C of x. Pause the video
for a moment to think about it. All of these
501:01 - candidate graphs that I've drawn have a nonzero
y intercept, that's meant to reflect the idea
501:06 - that there's some fixed startup cost and buying
equipment before you can even get started.
501:09 - Now, I would like to suggest that C of x should
be an increasing function of x, because it's
501:17 - going to cost more money to make more t shirts,
you need more supplies and labor. So this
501:23 - function is out. Now it's somewhat reasonable,
I think that C of x might be a linear function
501:30 - of x like it is here, if you've got the same
cost per t shirt, whether you make 10 t shirts,
501:35 - or 1000 t shirts, the slope in that case would
represent the cost per t shirt. And the linear
501:39 - function would mean that cost per t shirt
is constant, no matter how many t shirts you're
501:44 - making. But in reality, it's probably going
to be cheaper to make 1000 t shirts than it
501:50 - is to make just a few t shirts. And therefore
the cost per t shirt, sure slope should be
501:59 - going down as x increases. So this function
right here is the one whose slope is going
502:07 - down for larger access. And so I would say
that this is the most reasonable representation
502:14 - for C of x as a function of x. In other words,
C of x should be an increasing function, but
502:20 - C prime of x should be decreasing. C of 204
minus C of 200 represents the additional cost
502:27 - for making 204 t shirts instead of 200. In
formula, you might think of that as the cost
502:34 - of making the last four t shirts. The ratio
C of 200 for a minus C of 200 over four is
502:46 - the average rate of change of C of x. The
units are units of cost, which is probably
502:52 - dollars per t shirt. And formula you might
think of this as the additional cost per t
503:00 - shirt of making the last four t shirts. C
prime of 200 is the instantaneous rate of
503:03 - change of C of x. c of x is known as the cost
function. And C prime of x is called the marginal
503:09 - cost, which is the rate at which cost is increasing
per additional t shirt made. It might seem
503:15 - a little bit weird to take the derivative
of C of x since x can really only take on
503:23 - integer values. But we can always approximate
C of x with a function whose domain is all
503:28 - real numbers. To make this a little more specific,
let's use a cost function of C of x equals
503:34 - 500 plus 300 times the square root of x. In
this example, x is supposed to be the number
503:39 - of iPads that are produced, and C of x is
the cost of producing them in dollars. Then
503:44 - C of 401 minus C of 400. given by 500 plus
300, times the square root of 401 minus 500
503:51 - plus 300 times the square root of 400. This
simplifies to $7.50, rounded to the nearest
503:58 - cent. This means that it costs an additional
$7.50 to go from producing 400 iPads to 401
504:05 - iPad. In this fictitious example,
504:06 - if I want to compute C prime of 400, instead,
I can see that C prime of x is equal to 300
504:12 - times one half x to the minus one half. So
C prime of 400 is going to be 300 times one
504:18 - half times 400 to the negative one half, which
simplifies to 300 over two times the square
504:27 - root of 400, which is also 7.5, or $7.50.
Per iPad. Up to rounding to the nearest cent,
504:35 - these two answers are equal. And it makes
sense that C prime of 400 should equal approximately
504:44 - this difference. Since C prime of 400, the
derivative is approximately equal to the average
504:50 - rate of change going from 400 to 401, which
is just this difference, divided by one. Once
504:56 - again, C prime of 400 is called the marginal
cost, and represents the rate at which the
505:00 - cost function is increasing with each additional
item. This video gave an example of the cost
505:07 - function, and it's derivative, which is known
as marginal cost. This video introduces logarithms.
505:13 - logarithms are a way of writing exponents.
The expression log base a of B equals c means
505:21 - that a to the C equals b. In other words,
log base a of B is the exponent that you raise
505:32 - a to to get be. The number A is called the
base of the logarithm. It's also called the
505:41 - base when we write it in this exponential
form. Some students find it helpful to remember
505:50 - this relationship, log base a of B equals
c means a to the C equals b, by drawing arrows,
505:58 - if I want to compute C prime of 400, instead,
I can see that C prime of x is equal to 300
506:13 - times one half x to the minus one half. So
C prime of 400 is going to be 300 times one
506:25 - half times 400 to the negative one half, which
simplifies to 300 over two times the square
506:34 - root of 400, which is also 7.5, or $7.50.
Per iPad. Up to rounding to the nearest cent,
506:44 - these two answers are equal. And it makes
sense that C prime of 400 should equal approximately
506:55 - this difference. Since C prime of 400, the
derivative is approximately equal to the average
507:08 - rate of change going from 400 to 401, which
is just this difference, divided by one. Once
507:17 - again, C prime of 400 is called the marginal
cost, and represents the rate at which the
507:28 - cost function is increasing with each additional
item. This video gave an example of the cost
507:41 - function, and it's derivative, which is known
as marginal cost. This video introduces logarithms.
507:52 - logarithms are a way of writing exponents.
The expression log base a of B equals c means
508:04 - that a to the C equals b. In other words,
log base a of B is the exponent that you raise
508:15 - a to to get be. The number A is called the
base of the logarithm. It's also called the
508:27 - base when we write it in this exponential
form. Some students find it helpful to remember
508:36 - this relationship, log base a of B equals
c means a to the C equals b, by drawing arrows,
508:46 - a to the C equals b.
508:51 - a to the C equals b.
508:54 - Other students like to think of it in terms
of asking a question, log base a of fee, asks,
509:00 - What power do you raise a two in order to
get b? Let's look at some examples. log base
509:09 - two of eight is three, because two to the
three equals eight. In general, log base two
509:14 - of y is asking you the question, What power
do you have to raise to two to get y? So for
509:22 - example, log base two of 16 is four, because
it's asking you the question to two what power
509:28 - equals 16? And the answer is four. Please
pause the video and try some of these other
509:36 - examples. log base two of two is asking, What
power do you raise to two to get to? And the
509:44 - answer is one. Two to the one equals two.
log base two of one half is asking two to
509:52 - what power gives you one half? Well, to get
one half, you need to raise two to a negative
510:01 - power. So that would be two to the negative
one. So the answer is negative one. log base
510:07 - two of 1/8 means what power do we raise to
two in order to get 1/8. Since one eight is
510:12 - one over two cubed, we have to raise two to
the negative three power to get one over two
510:17 - cubed. So our exponent is negative three,
and that's our answer to our log expression.
510:23 - Finally, log base two of one is asking to
to what power equals one, or anything raised
510:30 - to the zero power gives us one, so this log
expression evaluates to zero. Notice that
510:34 - we can get positive negative and zero answers
for our logarithm expressions. Please pause
510:38 - the video and figure out what these logs evaluate
to to work out log base 10 of another Again,
510:42 - notice that a million is 10 to the sixth power.
Now we're asking the question, What power
510:48 - do we raise tend to to get a million? So that
is what power do we raise 10? to to get 10
510:57 - to the six? Well, of course, the answer is
going to be six. Similarly, since point O
511:07 - one is 10 to the minus three, this log expressions,
the same thing as asking, what's the log base
511:18 - 10 of 10 to the minus three? Well, what power
do you have to raise 10? to to get 10 to the
511:27 - minus three? Of course, the answer is negative
three. Log base 10 of zero is asking, What
511:32 - power do we raise 10 to to get zero. If you
think about it, there's no way to raise 10
511:42 - to an exponent get zero. Raising 10 to a positive
exponent gets us really big positive numbers.
511:51 - Raising 10 to a negative exponent is like
one over 10 to a power that's giving us tiny
511:58 - fractions, but they're still positive numbers,
we're never going to get zero. Even if we
512:03 - raised 10 to the zero power, we'll just get
one. So there's no way to get zero and the
512:10 - log base 10 of zero does not exist. If you
try it on your calculator using the log base
512:16 - 10 button, you'll get an error message. Same
thing happens when we do log base 10 of negative
512:21 - 100. We're asking 10 to what power equals
negative 100. And there's no exponent that
512:27 - will work. And more generally, it's possible
to take the log of numbers that are greater
512:31 - than zero, but not for numbers that are less
than or equal to zero. In other words, the
512:35 - domain of the function log base a of x, no
matter what base you're using, for a, the
512:43 - domain is going to be all positive numbers.
A few notes on notation. When you see ln of
512:49 - x, that's called natural log, and it means
the log base e of x, where he is that famous
512:58 - number that's about 2.718. When you see log
of x with no base at all, by convention, that
513:06 - means log base 10 of x, and it's called the
common log. Most scientific calculators have
513:12 - buttons for natural log, and for common log.
Let's practice rewriting expressions with
513:16 - logs in them. log base three of one nine is
negative two can be rewritten as the expression
513:22 - three to the negative two equals 1/9. Log
of 13 is shorthand for log base 10 of 13.
513:30 - So that can be rewritten as 10 to the 1.11394
equals 13. Finally, in this last expression,
513:39 - ln means natural log, or log base e, so I
can rewrite this equation as log base e of
513:50 - whenever E equals negative one. Well, that
means the same thing as e to the negative
513:58 - one equals one over e, which is true. Now
let's go the opposite direction. We'll start
514:05 - with exponential equations and rewrite them
as logs. Remember that log base a of B equals
514:13 - c means the same thing
514:16 - Other students like to think of it in terms
of asking a question, log base a of fee, asks,
514:26 - What power do you raise a two in order to
get b? Let's look at some examples. log base
514:36 - two of eight is three, because two to the
three equals eight. In general, log base two
514:39 - of y is asking you the question, What power
do you have to raise to two to get y? So for
514:46 - example, log base two of 16 is four, because
it's asking you the question to two what power
514:54 - equals 16? And the answer is four. Please
pause the video and try some of these other
515:04 - examples. log base two of two is asking, What
power do you raise to two to get to? And the
515:15 - answer is one. Two to the one equals two.
log base two of one half is asking two to
515:24 - what power gives you one half? Well, to get
one half, you need to raise two to a negative
515:35 - power. So that would be two to the negative
one. So the answer is negative one. log base
515:44 - two of 1/8 means what power do we raise to
two in order to get 1/8. Since one eight is
515:52 - one over two cubed, we have to raise two to
the negative three power to get one over two
515:59 - cubed. So our exponent is negative three,
and that's our answer to our log expression.
516:05 - Finally, log base two of one is asking to
to what power equals one, or anything raised
516:11 - to the zero power gives us one, so this log
expression evaluates to zero. Notice that
516:18 - we can get positive negative and zero answers
for our logarithm expressions. Please pause
516:23 - the video and figure out what these logs evaluate
to to work out log base 10 of another Again,
516:28 - notice that a million is 10 to the sixth power.
Now we're asking the question, What power
516:31 - do we raise tend to to get a million? So that
is what power do we raise 10? to to get 10
516:36 - to the six? Well, of course, the answer is
going to be six. Similarly, since point O
516:40 - one is 10 to the minus three, this log expressions,
the same thing as asking, what's the log base
516:51 - 10 of 10 to the minus three? Well, what power
do you have to raise 10? to to get 10 to the
517:05 - minus three? Of course, the answer is negative
three. Log base 10 of zero is asking, What
517:16 - power do we raise 10 to to get zero. If you
think about it, there's no way to raise 10
517:28 - to an exponent get zero. Raising 10 to a positive
exponent gets us really big positive numbers.
517:37 - Raising 10 to a negative exponent is like
one over 10 to a power that's giving us tiny
517:42 - fractions, but they're still positive numbers,
we're never going to get zero. Even if we
517:49 - raised 10 to the zero power, we'll just get
one. So there's no way to get zero and the
517:57 - log base 10 of zero does not exist. If you
try it on your calculator using the log base
518:04 - 10 button, you'll get an error message. Same
thing happens when we do log base 10 of negative
518:14 - 100. We're asking 10 to what power equals
negative 100. And there's no exponent that
518:21 - will work. And more generally, it's possible
to take the log of numbers that are greater
518:30 - than zero, but not for numbers that are less
than or equal to zero. In other words, the
518:35 - domain of the function log base a of x, no
matter what base you're using, for a, the
518:40 - domain is going to be all positive numbers.
A few notes on notation. When you see ln of
518:47 - x, that's called natural log, and it means
the log base e of x, where he is that famous
519:02 - number that's about 2.718. When you see log
of x with no base at all, by convention, that
519:10 - means log base 10 of x, and it's called the
common log. Most scientific calculators have
519:17 - buttons for natural log, and for common log.
Let's practice rewriting expressions with
519:24 - logs in them. log base three of one nine is
negative two can be rewritten as the expression
519:33 - three to the negative two equals 1/9. Log
of 13 is shorthand for log base 10 of 13.
519:42 - So that can be rewritten as 10 to the 1.11394
equals 13. Finally, in this last expression,
519:48 - ln means natural log, or log base e, so I
can rewrite this equation as log base e of
519:56 - whenever E equals negative one. Well, that
means the same thing as e to the negative
520:05 - one equals one over e, which is true. Now
let's go the opposite direction. We'll start
520:14 - with exponential equations and rewrite them
as logs. Remember that log base a of B equals
520:18 - c means the same thing
520:20 - as a to the C equals b,
520:23 - as a to the C equals b,
520:25 - the base stays the same in both expressions.
So for this example, the base of three in
520:32 - the exponential equation, that's going to
be the same as the base in our log. Now I
520:40 - just have to figure out what's in the argument
of the log. And what goes on the other side
520:52 - of the equal sign. Remember that the answer
to a log is an exponent. So the thing that
521:07 - goes in this box should be my exponent for
my exponential equation. In other words, you
521:14 - and I'll put the 9.78 as the argument of my
log. This works because log base three of
521:23 - 9.78 equals u means the same thing as three
to the U equals 9.78, which is just what we
521:34 - started with. In the second example, the base
of my exponential equation is E. So the base
521:41 - of my log is going to be the answer to my
log is an exponent. In this case, the exponent
521:49 - 3x plus seven. And the other expression, the
four minus y becomes my argument of my log.
521:56 - Let me check, log base e of four minus y equals
3x plus seven means e to 3x plus seven equals
522:06 - four minus Y, which is just what I started
with. I can also rewrite log base e as natural
522:16 - log. This video introduced the idea of logs.
And the fact that log base a of B equal c
522:28 - means the same thing as a to the C equals
b. So log base a of B is asking you the question,
522:36 - What power exponent Do you raise a to in order
to get b. In this video, we'll work out the
522:44 - graph, so some log functions and also talk
about their domains. For this first example,
522:50 - let's graph a log function by hand by plotting
some points. The function we're working with
522:55 - is y equals log base two of x, I'll make a
chart of x and y values. Since we're working
523:01 - this out by hand, I want to pick x values
for which it's easy to compute log base two
523:08 - of x. So I'll start out with the x value of
one. Because log base two of one is zero,
523:16 - log base anything of one is 02 is another
x value that's easy to compute log base two
523:22 - of two, that's asking, What power do I raise
to two to get to one? And the answer is one.
523:30 - Power other powers of two are easy to work
with. So for example, log base two of four
523:35 - that saying what power do I raise to to to
get four, so the answer is two. Similarly,
523:41 - log base two of eight is three, and log base
two of 16 is four. Let me also work with some
523:54 - fractional values for X. If x is one half,
then log base two of one half that saying
524:03 - what power do I raise to two to get one half?
Well, that needs a power of negative one.
524:12 - It's also easy to compute by hand, the log
base two of 1/4 and 1/8. log base two of 1/4
524:24 - is negative two, since two to the negative
two is 1/4. And similarly, log base two of
524:32 - 1/8 is negative three. I'll put some tick
marks on my x and y axes. Please pause the
524:43 - video and take a moment to plot these points.
Let's see I have the point, one, zero, that's
524:54 - here to one that's here, for two, that is
here. And then eight, three, which is
525:00 - the base stays the same in both expressions.
So for this example, the base of three in
525:12 - the exponential equation, that's going to
be the same as the base in our log. Now I
525:21 - just have to figure out what's in the argument
of the log. And what goes on the other side
525:31 - of the equal sign. Remember that the answer
to a log is an exponent. So the thing that
525:38 - goes in this box should be my exponent for
my exponential equation. In other words, you
525:46 - and I'll put the 9.78 as the argument of my
log. This works because log base three of
525:53 - 9.78 equals u means the same thing as three
to the U equals 9.78, which is just what we
526:00 - started with. In the second example, the base
of my exponential equation is E. So the base
526:06 - of my log is going to be the answer to my
log is an exponent. In this case, the exponent
526:17 - 3x plus seven. And the other expression, the
four minus y becomes my argument of my log.
526:26 - Let me check, log base e of four minus y equals
3x plus seven means e to 3x plus seven equals
526:32 - four minus Y, which is just what I started
with. I can also rewrite log base e as natural
526:36 - log. This video introduced the idea of logs.
And the fact that log base a of B equal c
526:43 - means the same thing as a to the C equals
b. So log base a of B is asking you the question,
526:51 - What power exponent Do you raise a to in order
to get b. In this video, we'll work out the
526:52 - graph, so some log functions and also talk
about their domains. For this first example,
526:54 - let's graph a log function by hand by plotting
some points. The function we're working with
527:02 - is y equals log base two of x, I'll make a
chart of x and y values. Since we're working
527:12 - this out by hand, I want to pick x values
for which it's easy to compute log base two
527:21 - of x. So I'll start out with the x value of
one. Because log base two of one is zero,
527:28 - log base anything of one is 02 is another
x value that's easy to compute log base two
527:36 - of two, that's asking, What power do I raise
to two to get to one? And the answer is one.
527:42 - Power other powers of two are easy to work
with. So for example, log base two of four
527:46 - that saying what power do I raise to to to
get four, so the answer is two. Similarly,
527:54 - log base two of eight is three, and log base
two of 16 is four. Let me also work with some
528:03 - fractional values for X. If x is one half,
then log base two of one half that saying
528:04 - what power do I raise to two to get one half?
Well, that needs a power of negative one.
528:05 - It's also easy to compute by hand, the log
base two of 1/4 and 1/8. log base two of 1/4
528:08 - is negative two, since two to the negative
two is 1/4. And similarly, log base two of
528:15 - 1/8 is negative three. I'll put some tick
marks on my x and y axes. Please pause the
528:24 - video and take a moment to plot these points.
Let's see I have the point, one, zero, that's
528:29 - here to one that's here, for two, that is
here. And then eight, three, which is
528:32 - here.
528:33 - here.
528:34 - And the fractional x values, one half goes
with negative one, and 1/4 with negative two
528:40 - 1/8 with negative three.
528:42 - And the fractional x values, one half goes
with negative one, and 1/4 with negative two
528:48 - 1/8 with negative three.
528:50 - And if I connect the dots, I get a graph that
looks something like this. If I had smaller
528:55 - and smaller fractions, I would keep getting
more and more negative answers when I took
529:00 - log base two of them, so my graph is getting
more and more negative, my y values are getting
529:06 - more and more negative as x is getting close
to zero. Now I didn't draw any parts of the
529:09 - graph over here with negative X values, I
didn't put any negative X values on my chart.
529:13 - That omission is no accident. Because if you
try to take the log base two or base anything
529:15 - of a negative number, like say negative four
or something, there's no answer. This doesn't
529:16 - exist because there's no power that you can
raise to two to get a negative number. So
529:17 - there are no points on the graph for negative
X values. And similarly, there are no points
529:20 - on the graph where x is zero, because you
can't take log base two of zero, there's no
529:21 - power you can raise to to to get zero. I want
to observe some key features of this graph.
529:22 - First of all, the domain is x values greater
than zero. In interval notation, I can write
529:23 - that as a round bracket because I don't want
to include zero to infinity, the range is
529:26 - going to be the y values, while they go all
the way down into the far reaches of the negative
529:28 - numbers. And the graph gradually increases
y value is getting bigger and bigger. So the
529:29 - range is actually all real numbers are an
interval notation negative infinity to infinity.
529:30 - Finally, I want to point out that this graph
has a vertical asymptote at the y axis, that
529:31 - is at the line x equals zero. I'll draw that
on my graph with a dotted line. A vertical
529:32 - asymptote is a line that our functions graph
gets closer and closer to so this is The graph
529:34 - of y equals log base two of x. But if I wanted
to graph say, y equals log base 10 of x, it
529:35 - would look very similar, it would still have
a domain of X values greater than zero, a
529:36 - range of all real numbers and a vertical asymptote
at the y axis, it would still go through the
529:37 - point one zero, but it would go through the
point 10. One instead, because log base 10
529:38 - of 10 is one, it would look pretty much the
same, just a lot flatter over here. But even
529:39 - though it doesn't look like it with the way
I've drawn it, it still gradually goes up
529:40 - to n towards infinity. In fact, the graph
of y equals log base neaa of X for a bigger
529:41 - than one looks pretty much the same, and has
the same three properties. Now that we know
529:42 - what the basic log graph looks like, we can
plot at least rough graphs of other log functions
529:43 - without plotting points. Here we have the
graph of natural log of X plus five. And again,
529:44 - I'm just going to draw a rough graph. If I
did want to do a more accurate graph, I probably
529:45 - would want to plot some points. But I know
that roughly a log graph, if it was just like
529:46 - y equals ln of x, that would look something
like this, and it would go through the point
529:47 - one zero,
529:48 - And if I connect the dots, I get a graph that
looks something like this. If I had smaller
529:53 - and smaller fractions, I would keep getting
more and more negative answers when I took
529:57 - log base two of them, so my graph is getting
more and more negative, my y values are getting
530:00 - more and more negative as x is getting close
to zero. Now I didn't draw any parts of the
530:02 - graph over here with negative X values, I
didn't put any negative X values on my chart.
530:03 - That omission is no accident. Because if you
try to take the log base two or base anything
530:05 - of a negative number, like say negative four
or something, there's no answer. This doesn't
530:06 - exist because there's no power that you can
raise to two to get a negative number. So
530:07 - there are no points on the graph for negative
X values. And similarly, there are no points
530:10 - on the graph where x is zero, because you
can't take log base two of zero, there's no
530:13 - power you can raise to to to get zero. I want
to observe some key features of this graph.
530:15 - First of all, the domain is x values greater
than zero. In interval notation, I can write
530:18 - that as a round bracket because I don't want
to include zero to infinity, the range is
530:19 - going to be the y values, while they go all
the way down into the far reaches of the negative
530:20 - numbers. And the graph gradually increases
y value is getting bigger and bigger. So the
530:21 - range is actually all real numbers are an
interval notation negative infinity to infinity.
530:22 - Finally, I want to point out that this graph
has a vertical asymptote at the y axis, that
530:23 - is at the line x equals zero. I'll draw that
on my graph with a dotted line. A vertical
530:24 - asymptote is a line that our functions graph
gets closer and closer to so this is The graph
530:25 - of y equals log base two of x. But if I wanted
to graph say, y equals log base 10 of x, it
530:26 - would look very similar, it would still have
a domain of X values greater than zero, a
530:27 - range of all real numbers and a vertical asymptote
at the y axis, it would still go through the
530:28 - point one zero, but it would go through the
point 10. One instead, because log base 10
530:29 - of 10 is one, it would look pretty much the
same, just a lot flatter over here. But even
530:30 - though it doesn't look like it with the way
I've drawn it, it still gradually goes up
530:31 - to n towards infinity. In fact, the graph
of y equals log base neaa of X for a bigger
530:32 - than one looks pretty much the same, and has
the same three properties. Now that we know
530:33 - what the basic log graph looks like, we can
plot at least rough graphs of other log functions
530:34 - without plotting points. Here we have the
graph of natural log of X plus five. And again,
530:35 - I'm just going to draw a rough graph. If I
did want to do a more accurate graph, I probably
530:36 - would want to plot some points. But I know
that roughly a log graph, if it was just like
530:37 - y equals ln of x, that would look something
like this, and it would go through the point
530:38 - one zero,
530:39 - with a vertical asymptote along the y axis.
Now if I want to graph ln of x plus five,
530:40 - that just shifts our graph by five units,
it'll still have the same vertical asymptote,
530:41 - since the vertical line shifted up by five
units is still a vertical line. But instead
530:42 - of going through one zero, it'll go through
the point, one, five. So I'll draw a rough
530:43 - sketch here. Let's compare our starting function
y equals ln x, and the transformed version
530:44 - y equals ln x plus five in terms of the domain,
the range and the vertical asymptote. Our
530:45 - original function y equals ln x had a domain
of zero to infinity. Since adding five on
530:46 - the outside affects the y values, and the
domain is the x values, this transformation
530:47 - doesn't change the domain. So the domain is
still from zero to infinity. Now the range
530:48 - of our original y equals ln x was from negative
infinity to infinity. Shifting up by five
530:49 - does affect the y values, and the range is
talking about the y values. But since the
530:50 - original range was all real numbers, if you
add five to all set of all real numbers, you
530:51 - still get the set of all real numbers. So
in this case, the range doesn't change either.
530:52 - And finally, we already saw that the original
vertical asymptote of the y axis x equals
530:53 - zero, when we shift that up by five units,
it's still the vertical line x equals zero.
530:54 - In this next example, we're starting with
a log base 10 function. And since the plus
530:55 - two is on the inside, that means we shift
that graph left by two. So I'll draw our basic
530:56 - log function. Here's our basic log function.
So I'll think of that as y equals log of x
530:57 - going through the point one, zero, here's
its vertical asymptote. Now I need to shift
530:58 - everything left by two. So my vertical asymptote
shifts left, and now it's at the line x equals
530:59 - negative two, instead of at x equals zero,
and my graph, let's see my point, one zero
531:00 - gets shifted to, let's see negative one zero,
since I'm subtracting two from the axis, and
531:01 - here's a rough sketch of the resulting graph.
Let's compare the features of the two graphs
531:02 - drawn here. We're talking about domains, the
original kind of domain of from zero to infinity.
531:03 - But now I've shifted that left. So I subtracted
two from all my exercises. And here's my new
531:04 - domain, which I can also verify just by looking
at the picture. My range was originally from
531:05 - negative infinity to infinity. Well, shifting
left only affects the x value, so it doesn't
531:06 - even affect the range. So my range is still
negative infinity to infinity. My vertical
531:07 - asymptote was originally at x equals zero.
And since I subtract two from all my x values,
531:08 - that shifts that to x equals negative two.
In this last problem, I'm not going to worry
531:09 - about drawing this graph. I'll just use algebra
to compute its domain. So let's think about
531:10 - What's the issue, when you're taking the logs
of things? Well, you can't take the log of
531:11 - a negative number or zero. So whatever is
inside the argument of the log function, whatever
531:12 - is being fed into log had better be greater
than zero. So I'll write that down, we need
531:13 - to minus 3x, to be greater than zero. Now
it's a matter of solving an inequality. Two
531:14 - has got to be greater than 3x. So two thirds
is greater than x. In other words, x has to
531:15 - be less than two thirds. So our domain is
all the x values from negative infinity to
531:16 - two thirds, not including two thirds, it's
a good idea to memorize the basic shape of
531:17 - the graph of a log function. It looks something
like this, go through the point one zero,
531:18 - and has a vertical asymptote on the y axis.
Also, if you remember that you can't take
531:19 - the log of a negative number, or zero, then
that helps you quickly compute domains for
531:20 - log functions. Whatever's inside the log function,
you set that greater than zero, and solve.
531:21 - This video is about combining logs and exponents.
Please pause the video and take a moment to
531:22 - use your calculator to evaluate the following
four expressions.
531:23 - with a vertical asymptote along the y axis.
Now if I want to graph ln of x plus five,
531:24 - that just shifts our graph by five units,
it'll still have the same vertical asymptote,
531:25 - since the vertical line shifted up by five
units is still a vertical line. But instead
531:26 - of going through one zero, it'll go through
the point, one, five. So I'll draw a rough
531:27 - sketch here. Let's compare our starting function
y equals ln x, and the transformed version
531:28 - y equals ln x plus five in terms of the domain,
the range and the vertical asymptote. Our
531:29 - original function y equals ln x had a domain
of zero to infinity. Since adding five on
531:30 - the outside affects the y values, and the
domain is the x values, this transformation
531:31 - doesn't change the domain. So the domain is
still from zero to infinity. Now the range
531:32 - of our original y equals ln x was from negative
infinity to infinity. Shifting up by five
531:33 - does affect the y values, and the range is
talking about the y values. But since the
531:34 - original range was all real numbers, if you
add five to all set of all real numbers, you
531:35 - still get the set of all real numbers. So
in this case, the range doesn't change either.
531:36 - And finally, we already saw that the original
vertical asymptote of the y axis x equals
531:37 - zero, when we shift that up by five units,
it's still the vertical line x equals zero.
531:38 - In this next example, we're starting with
a log base 10 function. And since the plus
531:39 - two is on the inside, that means we shift
that graph left by two. So I'll draw our basic
531:40 - log function. Here's our basic log function.
So I'll think of that as y equals log of x
531:41 - going through the point one, zero, here's
its vertical asymptote. Now I need to shift
531:42 - everything left by two. So my vertical asymptote
shifts left, and now it's at the line x equals
531:43 - negative two, instead of at x equals zero,
and my graph, let's see my point, one zero
531:44 - gets shifted to, let's see negative one zero,
since I'm subtracting two from the axis, and
531:45 - here's a rough sketch of the resulting graph.
Let's compare the features of the two graphs
531:46 - drawn here. We're talking about domains, the
original kind of domain of from zero to infinity.
531:47 - But now I've shifted that left. So I subtracted
two from all my exercises. And here's my new
531:48 - domain, which I can also verify just by looking
at the picture. My range was originally from
531:49 - negative infinity to infinity. Well, shifting
left only affects the x value, so it doesn't
531:50 - even affect the range. So my range is still
negative infinity to infinity. My vertical
531:51 - asymptote was originally at x equals zero.
And since I subtract two from all my x values,
531:52 - that shifts that to x equals negative two.
In this last problem, I'm not going to worry
531:53 - about drawing this graph. I'll just use algebra
to compute its domain. So let's think about
531:54 - What's the issue, when you're taking the logs
of things? Well, you can't take the log of
531:55 - a negative number or zero. So whatever is
inside the argument of the log function, whatever
531:56 - is being fed into log had better be greater
than zero. So I'll write that down, we need
531:57 - to minus 3x, to be greater than zero. Now
it's a matter of solving an inequality. Two
531:58 - has got to be greater than 3x. So two thirds
is greater than x. In other words, x has to
531:59 - be less than two thirds. So our domain is
all the x values from negative infinity to
532:00 - two thirds, not including two thirds, it's
a good idea to memorize the basic shape of
532:01 - the graph of a log function. It looks something
like this, go through the point one zero,
532:02 - and has a vertical asymptote on the y axis.
Also, if you remember that you can't take
532:03 - the log of a negative number, or zero, then
that helps you quickly compute domains for
532:04 - log functions. Whatever's inside the log function,
you set that greater than zero, and solve.
532:05 - This video is about combining logs and exponents.
Please pause the video and take a moment to
532:06 - use your calculator to evaluate the following
four expressions.
532:07 - Remember, that log base 10 on your calculator
is the log button. While log base e on your
532:08 - calculator is the natural log button, you
should find that the log base 10 of 10 cubed
532:09 - is three, the log base e of e to the 4.2 is
4.2 10 to the log base 10 of 1000 is 1000.
532:10 - And eat the log base e of 9.6 is 9.6. In each
case, the log and the exponential function
532:11 - with the same base undo each other, and we're
left with the exponent. In fact, it's true
532:12 - that for any base a the log base a of a to
the x is equal to x. The same sort of cancellation
532:13 - happens if we do the exponential function
in the log function with the same base in
532:14 - the opposite order. For example, we take 10
to the power of log base 10 of 1000, the 10
532:15 - to the power and the log base 10 undo each
other, and we're left with the 1000s. This
532:16 - happens for any base a a to the log base a
of x is equal to x. We can describe this by
532:17 - saying that an exponential function and a
log function with the same base undo each
532:18 - other. If you're familiar with the language
of inverse functions, the exponential function
532:19 - and log function are inverses. Let's see why
these roles hold for the first log role. log
532:20 - base a of a dx is asking the question, What
power do we raise a two in order to get a
532:21 - to the x? In other words, a to what power
is a to the x? Well, the answer is clearly
532:22 - x. And that's why log base a of a to the x
equals x. For the second log rule, notice
532:23 - that the log base a of x means the power we
raise a two to get x. But this expression
532:24 - is saying that we're supposed to raise a to
that power. If we raise a to the power, we
532:25 - need to raise a two to get x, then we'll certainly
get x. Now let's use these two roles. In some
532:26 - examples. If we want to find three to the
log base three of 1.43 to the power and log
532:27 - base three undo each other, so we're left
with 1.4.
532:28 - Remember, that log base 10 on your calculator
is the log button. While log base e on your
532:29 - calculator is the natural log button, you
should find that the log base 10 of 10 cubed
532:30 - is three, the log base e of e to the 4.2 is
4.2 10 to the log base 10 of 1000 is 1000.
532:31 - And eat the log base e of 9.6 is 9.6. In each
case, the log and the exponential function
532:32 - with the same base undo each other, and we're
left with the exponent. In fact, it's true
532:33 - that for any base a the log base a of a to
the x is equal to x. The same sort of cancellation
532:34 - happens if we do the exponential function
in the log function with the same base in
532:35 - the opposite order. For example, we take 10
to the power of log base 10 of 1000, the 10
532:36 - to the power and the log base 10 undo each
other, and we're left with the 1000s. This
532:37 - happens for any base a a to the log base a
of x is equal to x. We can describe this by
532:38 - saying that an exponential function and a
log function with the same base undo each
532:39 - other. If you're familiar with the language
of inverse functions, the exponential function
532:40 - and log function are inverses. Let's see why
these roles hold for the first log role. log
532:41 - base a of a dx is asking the question, What
power do we raise a two in order to get a
532:42 - to the x? In other words, a to what power
is a to the x? Well, the answer is clearly
532:43 - x. And that's why log base a of a to the x
equals x. For the second log rule, notice
532:44 - that the log base a of x means the power we
raise a two to get x. But this expression
532:45 - is saying that we're supposed to raise a to
that power. If we raise a to the power, we
532:46 - need to raise a two to get x, then we'll certainly
get x. Now let's use these two roles. In some
532:47 - examples. If we want to find three to the
log base three of 1.43 to the power and log
532:48 - base three undo each other, so we're left
with 1.4.
532:49 - If we want to find ln of e to the x, remember
that ln means log base e, so we're taking
532:50 - log base e of e to the x.
532:51 - If we want to find ln of e to the x, remember
that ln means log base e, so we're taking
532:52 - log base e of e to the x.
532:53 - Well, those functions undo each other and
we're left with x. If we want to take 10 to
532:54 - the log of three z, remember that log without
a base written implies that the base is 10.
532:55 - So really, we want to take 10 to the log base
10 of three z will tend to a power and log
532:56 - base 10 undo each other. So we're left with
a three z. Finally, does this last statement
532:57 - hold is ln of 10 to the x equal to x? Well,
ln means log base e. So we're taking log base
532:58 - e of 10 to the x, notice that the base of
the log and the base of the exponential function
532:59 - are not the same thing. So they don't undo
each other. And in fact, log base e of 10
533:00 - to the x is not usually equal to x, we can
check with one example, say if x equals one,
533:01 - then log base e of 10 to the one, that's log
base e of 10. And we can check on the calculator
533:02 - that's equal to 2.3. In some more decimals,
which is not the same thing as one. So this
533:03 - statement is false, it does not hold. We need
the basis to be the same for logs and exponent
533:04 - to undo each other. In this video, we saw
that logs and exponents with the same base
533:05 - undo each other. Specifically, log base a
of a to the x is equal to x and a to the log
533:06 - base a of x is also equal to x
533:07 - Well, those functions undo each other and
we're left with x. If we want to take 10 to
533:08 - the log of three z, remember that log without
a base written implies that the base is 10.
533:09 - So really, we want to take 10 to the log base
10 of three z will tend to a power and log
533:10 - base 10 undo each other. So we're left with
a three z. Finally, does this last statement
533:11 - hold is ln of 10 to the x equal to x? Well,
ln means log base e. So we're taking log base
533:12 - e of 10 to the x, notice that the base of
the log and the base of the exponential function
533:13 - are not the same thing. So they don't undo
each other. And in fact, log base e of 10
533:14 - to the x is not usually equal to x, we can
check with one example, say if x equals one,
533:15 - then log base e of 10 to the one, that's log
base e of 10. And we can check on the calculator
533:16 - that's equal to 2.3. In some more decimals,
which is not the same thing as one. So this
533:17 - statement is false, it does not hold. We need
the basis to be the same for logs and exponent
533:18 - to undo each other. In this video, we saw
that logs and exponents with the same base
533:19 - undo each other. Specifically, log base a
of a to the x is equal to x and a to the log
533:20 - base a of x is also equal to x
533:21 - for any values of x and any base a. This video
is about rules or properties of logs. The
533:22 - log rules are closely related to the exponent
rules. So let's start by reviewing some of
533:23 - the exponent rules.
533:24 - for any values of x and any base a. This video
is about rules or properties of logs. The
533:25 - log rules are closely related to the exponent
rules. So let's start by reviewing some of
533:26 - the exponent rules.
533:27 - To keep things simple, we'll write everything
down with a base of two. Even though the exponent
533:28 - rules hold for any base, we know that if we
raise two to the zero power, we get one, we
533:29 - have a product rule for exponents, which says
that two to the M times two to the n is equal
533:30 - to two to the m plus n. In other words, if
we multiply two numbers, then we add the exponents.
533:31 - We also have a quotient rule that says that
two to the M divided by n to the n is equal
533:32 - to two to the m minus n. In words, that says
that if we divide two numbers, then we subtract
533:33 - the exponents. Finally, we have a power rule
that says if we take a power to a power, then
533:34 - we multiply the exponents. Each of these exponent
rules can be rewritten as a log rule. The
533:35 - first rule, two to the zero equals one can
be rewritten in terms of logs as log base
533:36 - two of one equals zero. That's because log
base two of one equals zero means two to the
533:37 - zero equals one. The second rule, the product
rule, can be rewritten in terms of logs by
533:38 - saying log of x times y equals log of x plus
log of y. I'll make these base two to agree
533:39 - with my base that I'm using for my exponent
rules. In words, that says the log of the
533:40 - product is the sum of the logs. Since logs
really represent exponents. This is saying
533:41 - that when you multiply two numbers together,
you add their exponents, which is just what
533:42 - we said for the exponent version. The quotient
rule for exponents can be rewritten in terms
533:43 - of logs by saying the log of x divided by
y is equal to the log of x minus the log of
533:44 - y. In words, we can say that the log of the
quotient is equal to the difference of the
533:45 - logs. Since logs are really exponents, another
way of saying the same thing is that when
533:46 - you divide two numbers, you subtract their
exponents. That's how we described the exponent
533:47 - rule above. Finally, the power rule for exponents
can be rewritten in terms of logs by saying
533:48 - the log of x to the n is equal to n times
log of x. Sometimes people describe this rule
533:49 - by saying when you take the log of an expression
with an exponent, you can bring down the exponent
533:50 - and multiply. If we think of x as being some
power of two, this is really saying when we
533:51 - take a power to a power, we multiply their
exponents. That's exactly how we described
533:52 - the power rule above. It doesn't really matter
if you multiply this exponent on the left
533:53 - side, or on the right side, but it's more
traditional to multiply it on the left side.
533:54 - I've given these rules with the base of two,
but they actually work for any base. To help
533:55 - you remember them, please take a moment to
write out the log rules using a base of a
533:56 - you should get the following chart. Let's
use the log rules to rewrite the following
533:57 - expressions as a sum or difference of logs.
In the first expression, we have a log base
533:58 - 10 of a quotient. So we can rewrite the log
of the quotient
533:59 - To keep things simple, we'll write everything
down with a base of two. Even though the exponent
534:00 - rules hold for any base, we know that if we
raise two to the zero power, we get one, we
534:01 - have a product rule for exponents, which says
that two to the M times two to the n is equal
534:02 - to two to the m plus n. In other words, if
we multiply two numbers, then we add the exponents.
534:03 - We also have a quotient rule that says that
two to the M divided by n to the n is equal
534:04 - to two to the m minus n. In words, that says
that if we divide two numbers, then we subtract
534:05 - the exponents. Finally, we have a power rule
that says if we take a power to a power, then
534:06 - we multiply the exponents. Each of these exponent
rules can be rewritten as a log rule. The
534:07 - first rule, two to the zero equals one can
be rewritten in terms of logs as log base
534:08 - two of one equals zero. That's because log
base two of one equals zero means two to the
534:09 - zero equals one. The second rule, the product
rule, can be rewritten in terms of logs by
534:10 - saying log of x times y equals log of x plus
log of y. I'll make these base two to agree
534:11 - with my base that I'm using for my exponent
rules. In words, that says the log of the
534:12 - product is the sum of the logs. Since logs
really represent exponents. This is saying
534:13 - that when you multiply two numbers together,
you add their exponents, which is just what
534:14 - we said for the exponent version. The quotient
rule for exponents can be rewritten in terms
534:15 - of logs by saying the log of x divided by
y is equal to the log of x minus the log of
534:16 - y. In words, we can say that the log of the
quotient is equal to the difference of the
534:17 - logs. Since logs are really exponents, another
way of saying the same thing is that when
534:18 - you divide two numbers, you subtract their
exponents. That's how we described the exponent
534:19 - rule above. Finally, the power rule for exponents
can be rewritten in terms of logs by saying
534:20 - the log of x to the n is equal to n times
log of x. Sometimes people describe this rule
534:21 - by saying when you take the log of an expression
with an exponent, you can bring down the exponent
534:22 - and multiply. If we think of x as being some
power of two, this is really saying when we
534:23 - take a power to a power, we multiply their
exponents. That's exactly how we described
534:24 - the power rule above. It doesn't really matter
if you multiply this exponent on the left
534:25 - side, or on the right side, but it's more
traditional to multiply it on the left side.
534:26 - I've given these rules with the base of two,
but they actually work for any base. To help
534:27 - you remember them, please take a moment to
write out the log rules using a base of a
534:28 - you should get the following chart. Let's
use the log rules to rewrite the following
534:29 - expressions as a sum or difference of logs.
In the first expression, we have a log base
534:30 - 10 of a quotient. So we can rewrite the log
of the quotient
534:31 - as the difference of the logs. Now we still
have the log of a product, I can rewrite the
534:32 - log of a product as the sum of the logs
534:33 - as the difference of the logs. Now we still
have the log of a product, I can rewrite the
534:34 - log of a product as the sum of the logs
534:35 - So that is log of y plus log of z. When I
put things together, I have to be careful,
534:36 - because here I'm subtracting the entire log
expression. So I need to subtract both terms
534:37 - of this son.
534:38 - So that is log of y plus log of z. When I
put things together, I have to be careful,
534:39 - because here I'm subtracting the entire log
expression. So I need to subtract both terms
534:40 - of this son.
534:41 - I'll make sure I do that by putting them in
parentheses. Now I can simplify a little bit
534:42 - by distributing the negative sign. And here's
my final answer. In my next expression, I
534:43 - have the log of a product. So I can rewrite
that as the sum of two logs. I can also use
534:44 - my power rule to bring down the exponent T,
and multiply it in the front. That gives me
534:45 - the final expression log of five plus
534:46 - I'll make sure I do that by putting them in
parentheses. Now I can simplify a little bit
534:47 - by distributing the negative sign. And here's
my final answer. In my next expression, I
534:48 - have the log of a product. So I can rewrite
that as the sum of two logs. I can also use
534:49 - my power rule to bring down the exponent T,
and multiply it in the front. That gives me
534:50 - the final expression log of five plus
534:51 - t times log of two. One common mistake on
this problem is to rewrite this expression
534:52 - as t times log of five times two. In fact,
those two expressions are not equal. Because
534:53 - the T only applies to the two, not to the
whole five times two, we can't just bring
534:54 - it down in front using the power rule. After
all, the power rule only applies to a single
534:55 - expression raised to an exponent, and not
to a product like this. And these next examples,
534:56 - we're going to go the other direction. Here,
we're given sums and differences of logs.
534:57 - And we want to wrap them up into a single
log expression. By look at the first two pieces,
534:58 - that's a difference of logs. So I know I can
rewrite it as the log of a quotient. Now I
534:59 - have the sum of two logs. So I can rewrite
that as the log of a product. I'll clean that
535:00 - up a little bit and rewrite it as log base
five of a times c over B. In my second example,
535:01 - I can rewrite the sum of my logs as the log
of a product. Now, I would like to rewrite
535:02 - this difference of logs as the log of a quotient,
but I can't do it yet, because of that factor
535:03 - of two multiplied in front. But I can use
the power rule backwards to put that two back
535:04 - up in the exponent. So I'll do that first.
So I will copy down the ln of x plus one times
535:05 - x minus one, and rewrite this second term
as ln of x squared minus one squared. Now
535:06 - I have a straightforward difference of two
logs, which I can rewrite as the log of a
535:07 - quotient. I can actually simplify this some
more. Since x plus one times x minus one is
535:08 - the same thing as x squared minus one. I can
cancel factors to get ln of one over x squared
535:09 - minus one. In this video, we solve for rules
for logs that are related to exponent rules.
535:10 - First, we saw that the log with any base of
one is equal to zero. Second, we saw the product
535:11 - rule, the log of a product is equal to the
sum of the logs. We saw the quotient rule,
535:12 - the log of a quotient is the difference of
the logs. And we saw the power rule. When
535:13 - you take a log of an expression with an exponent
in it, you can bring down the exponent and
535:14 - multiply it. It's worth noticing that there's
no log rule that helps you split up the log
535:15 - of a song. In particular, the log of a psalm
is not equal to the sum of the logs. If you
535:16 - think about logs and exponent rules going
together, this kind of makes sense, because
535:17 - there's also no rule for rewriting the sum
of two exponential expressions. Log roles
535:18 - will be super handy. As we start to solve
equations using locks. The chain rule is a
535:19 - really useful method for finding the derivative
of the composition of two functions. Let's
535:20 - start with a brief review of composition.
f composed with g means that we apply f to
535:21 - the output of G as a diagram, this means we
start with x and apply g first.
535:22 - t times log of two. One common mistake on
this problem is to rewrite this expression
535:23 - as t times log of five times two. In fact,
those two expressions are not equal. Because
535:24 - the T only applies to the two, not to the
whole five times two, we can't just bring
535:25 - it down in front using the power rule. After
all, the power rule only applies to a single
535:26 - expression raised to an exponent, and not
to a product like this. And these next examples,

535:30 - have the sum of two logs. So I can rewrite
that as the log of a product. I'll clean that
535:31 - up a little bit and rewrite it as log base
five of a times c over B. In my second example,
535:32 - I can rewrite the sum of my logs as the log
of a product. Now, I would like to rewrite
535:33 - this difference of logs as the log of a quotient,

535:34 - of two multiplied in front. But I can use
the power rule backwards to put that two back

So I will copy down the ln of x plus one times
535:36 - x minus one, and rewrite this second term
as ln of x squared minus one squared. Now
535:37 - I have a straightforward difference of two
logs, which I can rewrite as the log of a
535:38 - quotient. I can actually simplify this some

535:39 - the same thing as x squared minus one. I can
cancel factors to get ln of one over x squared

for logs that are related to exponent rules.

535:49 - will be super handy. As we start to solve
equations using locks. The chain rule is a
535:50 - really useful method for finding the derivative
of the composition of two functions. Let's
535:51 - start with a brief review of composition.
f composed with g means that we apply f to
535:52 - the output of G as a diagram, this means we
start with x and apply g first.
535:53 - Then we apply f to the output to get our final
results I'm going to call G, the inner function,
535:54 - and F the outer function. Because g looks
like it's on the inside of f,
535:55 - Then we apply f to the output to get our final
results I'm going to call G, the inner function,
535:56 - and F the outer function. Because g looks
like it's on the inside of f,
535:57 - in this standard notation, we can write h
of x, which is the square root of sine of
535:58 - x as the composition of two functions, by
letting sine of x be the inner function, and
535:59 - the square root function be the outer function,
which I write as f of u equals the square
536:00 - root of u. I like to do this sort of dissection
of functions, by drawing a box around part
536:01 - of the function, whatever is inside the box
becomes my inner function, whatever we do
536:02 - to the box becomes our outer function, in
this case, taking the square root. This allows
536:03 - us to write h of x as the composition, f of
g of x, where f and g are the outer and inner
536:04 - functions defined here. Please take a moment
to write the next two functions as compositions
536:05 - of functions, before you go on. A natural
way to write k of x as a composition is to
536:06 - let our inner function be tan of x plus seacon
of x. The outer function describes what happens
536:07 - to that box the inner function, it gets cubed
and multiplied by five. There's several ways
536:08 - to write the next example as a composition
of functions. For example, we could take x
536:09 - squared as our inner function, and then our
outer function takes a to the sign of that
536:10 - inner function. Alternatively, we could take
the inner function to be sine of x squared.
536:11 - And then the outer function
536:12 - in this standard notation, we can write h
of x, which is the square root of sine of
536:13 - x as the composition of two functions, by
letting sine of x be the inner function, and
536:14 - the square root function be the outer function,
which I write as f of u equals the square
536:15 - root of u. I like to do this sort of dissection

536:18 - us to write h of x as the composition, f of
g of x, where f and g are the outer and inner
536:19 - functions defined here. Please take a moment
to write the next two functions as compositions
536:20 - of functions, before you go on. A natural

and multiplied by five. There's several ways
536:23 - to write the next example as a composition

536:24 - squared as our inner function, and then our
outer function takes a to the sign of that
536:25 - inner function. Alternatively, we could take
the inner function to be sine of x squared.
536:26 - And then the outer function
536:27 - has to be e to the power. It's also possible
to write our function r of x as a composition
536:28 - of three functions. An inner function of x
squared, a middle function of sine and an
536:29 - outermost function of e to the power, which
are right as h of V equals e to the V.
536:30 - has to be e to the power. It's also possible
to write our function r of x as a composition
536:31 - of three functions. An inner function of x
squared, a middle function of sine and an
536:32 - outermost function of e to the power, which
are right as h of V equals e to the V.
536:33 - When calculating the derivatives of complicated
functions, it's really important to recognize
536:34 - them as compositions of simpler functions.
That way, we can build up the derivative in
536:35 - terms of the simpler derivatives. And that's
the idea behind the chain rule. The chain
536:36 - rule tells us if we have two differentiable
functions, then the derivative of the composition
536:37 - f composed with g of x is equal to the derivative
of the outer function evaluated on the inner
536:38 - function times the derivative of the inner
function. Sometimes the chain rule is written
536:39 - instead, in lightness notation, that is the
dydx notation. To see how this works, let's
536:40 - let u equal g of x. And let's let y equal
f of u. In other words, y is f of

f of u. In other words, y is f of
536:49 - g of x.
536:50 - g of x.
536:51 - Now do u dx is just another way of writing
g prime of x, and d y d u is another way of
536:52 - writing f prime of U. or in other words, f
prime of g of x. Finally, if we write D y
536:53 - dX, that means we're taking the derivative
of f composed with g. So that's f composed
536:54 - with g prime of x. Using this key, I can rewrite
the expression above as the y dx equals d
536:55 - y d u
536:56 - Now do u dx is just another way of writing
g prime of x, and d y d u is another way of
536:57 - writing f prime of U. or in other words, f
prime of g of x. Finally, if we write D y
536:58 - dX, that means we're taking the derivative
of f composed with g. So that's f composed
536:59 - with g prime of x. Using this key, I can rewrite
the expression above as the y dx equals d
537:00 - y d u
537:01 - times d u dx. These are the two alternative
ways of writing the chain rule. Let's use
537:02 - the chain rule to take the derivative of the
square root of sine x.
537:03 - times d u dx. These are the two alternative
ways of writing the chain rule. Let's use
537:04 - the chain rule to take the derivative of the
square root of sine x.
537:05 - Actually, I'm going to rewrite this as h of
x equals sine x to the one half power to make
537:06 - it easier to take derivatives. As a composition,
we're thinking of the inner function as sine
537:07 - x and the outer function as the one half power.
So the chain rule tells us that to take h
537:08 - prime
537:09 - Actually, I'm going to rewrite this as h of
x equals sine x to the one half power to make
537:10 - it easier to take derivatives. As a composition,
we're thinking of the inner function as sine
537:11 - x and the outer function as the one half power.
So the chain rule tells us that to take h
537:12 - prime
537:13 - of x we need to take the derivative of the
outer function evaluated on the inner function
537:14 - and then multiply that by the derivative of
the inner function, we know that the derivative
537:15 - of the inner function, sine x is just cosine
x. And the derivative of the outer function
537:16 - is one half times u to the negative one half.
So h prime of x is then one half times u to
537:17 - the negative one half. But that's evaluated
on the inner function, sine of
537:18 - of x we need to take the derivative of the
outer function evaluated on the inner function
537:19 - and then multiply that by the derivative of
the inner function, we know that the derivative
537:20 - of the inner function, sine x is just cosine
x. And the derivative of the outer function
537:21 - is one half times u to the negative one half.
So h prime of x is then one half times u to
537:22 - the negative one half. But that's evaluated
on the inner function, sine of
537:23 - x.
537:24 - x.
537:25 - And then we multiply that by cosine of x.
Again, that's the derivative of the outer
537:26 - function evaluated on the inner function times
the derivative of the inner function. And
537:27 - we found the derivative using the chain rule.
For the next example, our inner function was
537:28 - tan x plus seacon X and our outer function,
f of u was five u cubed. So k prime of x is
537:29 - 15 times u squared. But that's the evaluated
on the inner function 10x plus seacon x, then
537:30 - we still need to multiply that by the derivative
of the inner function 10x plus seacon x. So
537:31 - we get the 15 tan x plus secant x squared
times the derivative of tan x, which is secant
537:32 - squared x, plus the derivative of secant x,
which is secant x, tan x. And that's our chain
537:33 - rule derivative. In this last example, we're
thinking of the outermost function as being
537:34 - e to the power and its inner function is sine
of x squared. But sine of x squared itself
537:35 - has an outer function of sine and an inner
function of x squared. So to find r prime
537:36 - of x, we first have to take the derivative
of the outermost function, well, the derivative
537:37 - of e to the power is just e to the power.
537:38 - And then we multiply that by cosine of x.
Again, that's the derivative of the outer
537:39 - function evaluated on the inner function times
the derivative of the inner function. And
537:40 - we found the derivative using the chain rule.
For the next example, our inner function was
537:41 - tan x plus seacon X and our outer function,
f of u was five u cubed. So k prime of x is
537:42 - 15 times u squared. But that's the evaluated
on the inner function 10x plus seacon x, then
537:43 - we still need to multiply that by the derivative
of the inner function 10x plus seacon x. So
537:44 - we get the 15 tan x plus secant x squared
times the derivative of tan x, which is secant
537:45 - squared x, plus the derivative of secant x,
which is secant x, tan x. And that's our chain
537:46 - rule derivative. In this last example, we're
thinking of the outermost function as being
537:47 - e to the power and its inner function is sine
of x squared. But sine of x squared itself
537:48 - has an outer function of sine and an inner
function of x squared. So to find r prime
537:49 - of x, we first have to take the derivative
of the outermost function, well, the derivative
537:50 - of e to the power is just e to the power.
537:51 - And now we evaluate that on its inner function,
sine of x squared. But now by the chain rule,
537:52 - we have to multiply that by the derivative
of the inner function, sine of x squared.
537:53 - I'll copy down the E to the sine x squared.
And I'll use the chain rule a second time
537:54 - to find the derivative of sine x squared.
Now the outer function is sine, and the derivative
537:55 - of sine is cosine. I need to evaluate it on
its inner function of x squared, and then
537:56 - multiply that by the derivative of the inner
function. After copying things down, I just
537:57 - have to take the derivative of x squared,
which is 2x
537:58 - And now we evaluate that on its inner function,
sine of x squared. But now by the chain rule,
537:59 - we have to multiply that by the derivative
of the inner function, sine of x squared.
538:00 - I'll copy down the E to the sine x squared.
And I'll use the chain rule a second time
538:01 - to find the derivative of sine x squared.
Now the outer function is sine, and the derivative
538:02 - of sine is cosine. I need to evaluate it on
its inner function of x squared, and then
538:03 - multiply that by the derivative of the inner
function. After copying things down, I just
538:04 - have to take the derivative of x squared,
which is 2x
538:05 - by the power.
538:06 - by the power.
538:07 - This video introduced the chain rule, which
says that the derivative of f composed with
538:08 - g at x is equal to f prime at g of x times
g prime at x, or equivalently, d y dx is equal
538:09 - to d y d u times d u dx. This video gives
some more examples and a justification of
538:10 - the chain rule, and also includes a handy
formula for the derivative of a to the x with
538:11 - respect to x, where A is any positive number.
In the next example, I want to show using
538:12 - the chain rule that the derivative of five
to the x is equal to ln five times five to
538:13 - the x. First, I want to rewrite five to the
x as easily ln five times x. And I can do
538:14 - that because e to the ln five is equal to
five. So e to the ln five to the x power is
538:15 - equal to five to the x. But e to the ln five
to the x power using exponent rules is just
538:16 - e to the ln five times x. So if I want to
take the derivative of five to the x, after
538:17 - rewriting it as e to the ln five times x,
let me think of the inner function as being
538:18 - ln five times x. And I'm going to think of
the outer function as being E to that power.
538:19 - That's what I wanted to Make the derivative
of. So by the chain rule, I can first take
538:20 - the derivative of the outer function, derivative
of e to the power is just e to the power,
538:21 - and I evaluate it at its inner function. But
then by the chain rule, I need to take the
538:22 - derivative of the inner function, well, the
derivative of ln five times x is just the
538:23 - constant coefficient ln five. And that's my
derivative. Now, I know that e to the ln five
538:24 - times x is just five to the x. That's what
we talked about before. So my final answer
538:25 - is five to the x times ln five, or I guess
I can rewrite that in the other order. That
538:26 - is that there's nothing special about five
in this example, I could have done this same
538:27 - process with any a base positive base a. So
I'm going to write that as a general principle
538:28 - that the derivative of a to the x with respect
to x is equal to ln a times a to the x. This
538:29 - is a fact worth memorizing. I'll use this
fact to compute the derivative of this complicated
538:30 - expression, sine of 5x times the square root
of two to the cosine 5x plus one. To find
538:31 - dydx, I'll first use the product rule, since
our expression is the product of two other
538:32 - expressions. So D y dX is the first expression
times the derivative of the second expression,
538:33 - which I'll go ahead and write using an exponent
instead of a square root sign, plus the derivative
538:34 - of the first expression times the second expression.
Now I'll need to use the chain rule to evaluate
538:35 - the derivative here. My outermost function
is the function that raises everything to
538:36 - the one half power. So when I take the derivative,
I can use the power rule, bring down the one
538:37 - half, right to the cosine 5x plus one to the
negative one half. But then by the chain rule,
538:38 - I'm going to have to multiply by the derivative
of the inner function, which is to to the
538:39 - cosine 5x plus one, I'll just carry along
the rest of my expression for now, what I
538:40 - want to take the derivative of two to the
cosine 5x plus one, I'm going to have to use
538:41 - the chain rule again, thinking of my outer
function as being two to the power plus one.
538:42 - So let me copy things down on the next line.
Now taking the derivative, the derivative
538:43 - of one is just zero, so I'm really just taking
the derivative of two to the cosine 5x. And
538:44 - by my formula, this is going to be ln f two
times two
538:45 - This video introduced the chain rule, which
says that the derivative of f composed with
538:46 - g at x is equal to f prime at g of x times
g prime at x, or equivalently, d y dx is equal
538:47 - to d y d u times d u dx. This video gives
some more examples and a justification of
538:48 - the chain rule, and also includes a handy

538:49 - respect to x, where A is any positive number.
In the next example, I want to show using
538:50 - the chain rule that the derivative of five
to the x is equal to ln five times five to
538:51 - the x. First, I want to rewrite five to the
x as easily ln five times x. And I can do
538:52 - that because e to the ln five is equal to
five. So e to the ln five to the x power is
538:53 - equal to five to the x. But e to the ln five
to the x power using exponent rules is just
538:54 - e to the ln five times x. So if I want to
take the derivative of five to the x, after
538:55 - rewriting it as e to the ln five times x,
let me think of the inner function as being
538:56 - ln five times x. And I'm going to think of
the outer function as being E to that power.
538:57 - That's what I wanted to Make the derivative
of. So by the chain rule, I can first take
538:58 - the derivative of the outer function, derivative
of e to the power is just e to the power,
538:59 - and I evaluate it at its inner function. But
then by the chain rule, I need to take the
539:00 - derivative of the inner function, well, the
derivative of ln five times x is just the
539:01 - constant coefficient ln five. And that's my
derivative. Now, I know that e to the ln five
539:02 - times x is just five to the x. That's what
we talked about before. So my final answer
539:03 - is five to the x times ln five, or I guess
I can rewrite that in the other order. That
539:04 - is that there's nothing special about five
in this example, I could have done this same
539:05 - process with any a base positive base a. So
I'm going to write that as a general principle

times the derivative of the second expression,
539:11 - which I'll go ahead and write using an exponent

539:12 - of the first expression times the second expression.
Now I'll need to use the chain rule to evaluate
539:13 - the derivative here. My outermost function
is the function that raises everything to
539:14 - the one half power. So when I take the derivative,
I can use the power rule, bring down the one
539:15 - half, right to the cosine 5x plus one to the

cosine 5x plus one, I'm going to have to use
539:19 - the chain rule again, thinking of my outer
function as being two to the power plus one.
539:20 - So let me copy things down on the next line.
Now taking the derivative, the derivative
539:21 - of one is just zero, so I'm really just taking
the derivative of two to the cosine 5x. And
539:22 - by my formula, this is going to be ln f two
times two
539:23 - to the power of cosine 5x. But of course,
I have to use the chain rule
539:24 - to the power of cosine 5x. But of course,
I have to use the chain rule
539:25 - and multiply by that the derivative of the
inner function here, which is cosine 5x. Again,
539:26 - I'm just going to carry the rest of the expression
along with me for the ride for now. Now we're
539:27 - taking the derivative of cosine 5x, I think
of cosine as the outer function. And five
539:28 - times x is the inner function. Similarly,
down here, sign is the outer function, and
539:29 - 5x is the inner function. So I can complete
my work by copying a lot of stuff down, and
539:30 - now taking the derivative of cosine, which
is minus sine, evaluated at its inner function,
539:31 - times the derivative of the inner function
5x, which is just five. And I'm going to add
539:32 - to that the derivative of sine of 5x. Well,
the derivative of sine is cosine, evaluated
539:33 - on its inner function times the derivative
of the inner function 5x, which is just five
539:34 - times the rest of the stuff. I'll do a modest
amount of simplification, maybe bring the
539:35 - constants out and combine any terms that I
can. And that's the end of that complicated
539:36 - example. And the next example, we'll try to
find the derivative of a composition at the
539:37 - value x equals one just based on a table of
values. So the chain rule says that the derivative
539:38 - of f composed with g is just going to be f
prime evaluated g of x times g prime evaluated
539:39 - x, but I want to do this whole process at
x equals one. So that's just going to be f
539:40 - prime at g of one times g prime of one. Well,
g of one is two. So I really want f prime
539:41 - at two, and f prime at two is 10. And g prime
at one is negative five. So my answer is negative
539:42 - 50. I'm not going to give a rigorous proof
of the chain rule. But I would like to give
539:43 - a more informal explanation based on the limit
definition of derivative. So I'm going to
539:44 - write the derivative of f composed with g
evaluated a point A, as the limit as x goes
539:45 - to a of f composed with g of x minus f composed
with g of A divided by x minus a. I'll rewrite
539:46 - this slightly. And now we're going to multiply
the top and the bottom by g of x minus g of
539:47 - a, that doesn't change the value of expression,
provided that g of x minus g of A is not zero.
539:48 - That's the detail on sweeping under the rug
here and why this is not a real proof, but
539:49 - just a more informal explanation. Now if I
rearrange things, and rewrite the limit of
539:50 - the product as the product of the limits,
my limit on the right here is just the derivative
539:51 - of g. for the limit on the left, notice that
as x goes to a, g of x has to go to g of a,
539:52 - since G is differentiable on there for continuous
function. So I can rewrite this and letting
539:53 - say u be equal to g of x, I can rewrite this
as the limit as u goes to g of a of f of u
539:54 - minus f of g of A over u minus g of a. Now
my expression on the left is just another
539:55 - way of writing the derivative of f evaluated
at g of a. And I've arrived at the expression
539:56 - for the chain rule. Let me just emphasize
again, this is just a pseudo proof, it's not
539:57 - quite airtight, because g of x minus g of
a might be zero. In this video, we saw some
539:58 - more examples of the chain rule justification
of it. And we saw that the derivative respect
539:59 - to x
540:00 - and multiply by that the derivative of the
inner function here, which is cosine 5x. Again,
540:01 - I'm just going to carry the rest of the expression
along with me for the ride for now. Now we're
540:02 - taking the derivative of cosine 5x, I think
of cosine as the outer function. And five
540:03 - times x is the inner function. Similarly,
down here, sign is the outer function, and
540:04 - 5x is the inner function. So I can complete
my work by copying a lot of stuff down, and
540:05 - now taking the derivative of cosine, which
is minus sine, evaluated at its inner function,
540:06 - times the derivative of the inner function
5x, which is just five. And I'm going to add
540:07 - to that the derivative of sine of 5x. Well,
the derivative of sine is cosine, evaluated
540:08 - on its inner function times the derivative
of the inner function 5x, which is just five
540:09 - times the rest of the stuff. I'll do a modest
amount of simplification, maybe bring the
540:10 - constants out and combine any terms that I
can. And that's the end of that complicated
540:11 - example. And the next example, we'll try to
find the derivative of a composition at the
540:12 - value x equals one just based on a table of
values. So the chain rule says that the derivative
540:13 - of f composed with g is just going to be f
prime evaluated g of x times g prime evaluated
540:14 - x, but I want to do this whole process at
x equals one. So that's just going to be f
540:15 - prime at g of one times g prime of one. Well,
g of one is two. So I really want f prime
540:16 - at two, and f prime at two is 10. And g prime
at one is negative five. So my answer is negative
540:17 - 50. I'm not going to give a rigorous proof
of the chain rule. But I would like to give
540:18 - a more informal explanation based on the limit
definition of derivative. So I'm going to
540:19 - write the derivative of f composed with g
evaluated a point A, as the limit as x goes
540:20 - to a of f composed with g of x minus f composed
with g of A divided by x minus a. I'll rewrite
540:21 - this slightly. And now we're going to multiply
the top and the bottom by g of x minus g of
540:22 - a, that doesn't change the value of expression,
provided that g of x minus g of A is not zero.
540:23 - That's the detail on sweeping under the rug
here and why this is not a real proof, but
540:24 - just a more informal explanation. Now if I
rearrange things, and rewrite the limit of
540:25 - the product as the product of the limits,
my limit on the right here is just the derivative
540:26 - of g. for the limit on the left, notice that
as x goes to a, g of x has to go to g of a,
540:27 - since G is differentiable on there for continuous
function. So I can rewrite this and letting
540:28 - say u be equal to g of x, I can rewrite this
as the limit as u goes to g of a of f of u
540:29 - minus f of g of A over u minus g of a. Now
my expression on the left is just another
540:30 - way of writing the derivative of f evaluated
at g of a. And I've arrived at the expression
540:31 - for the chain rule. Let me just emphasize
again, this is just a pseudo proof, it's not
540:32 - quite airtight, because g of x minus g of
a might be zero. In this video, we saw some
540:33 - more examples of the chain rule justification
of it. And we saw that the derivative respect
540:34 - to x
540:35 - of A to the X is equal to ln of a times a
to the x. This video gives an explanation
540:36 - for why the chain rule holds.
540:37 - of A to the X is equal to ln of a times a
to the x. This video gives an explanation
540:38 - for why the chain rule holds.
540:39 - I'm not going to give a rigorous proof of
the chain rule. But I would like to give a
540:40 - more informal explanation based on the limit
definition of derivative.
540:41 - I'm not going to give a rigorous proof of
the chain rule. But I would like to give a
540:42 - more informal explanation based on the limit
definition of derivative.
540:43 - So I'm going to write the derivative of f
composed with g evaluated a point A, as the
540:44 - limit as x goes to a of f composed with g
of x minus f composed with g of A divided
540:45 - by x minus a. I'll rewrite this slightly.
And now we're going to multiply the top and
540:46 - the bottom by g of x minus g of a, that doesn't
change the value of expression, provided that
540:47 - g of x minus g of A is not zero. That's the
detail on sweeping under the rug here and
540:48 - why this is not a real proof, but just a more
informal explanation. Now if I rearrange things,
540:49 - and rewrite the limit of the product as the
product of the limits, my limit on the right
540:50 - here is just the derivative of g. for the
limit on the left, notice that as x goes to
540:51 - a, g of x has to go to G evey, since G is
differentiable on there for a continuous function,
540:52 - so I can rewrite this and letting say u be
equal to g of x, I can rewrite this as the
540:53 - limit as u goes to g of a of f of u minus
f of g of A
540:54 - So I'm going to write the derivative of f
composed with g evaluated a point A, as the
540:55 - limit as x goes to a of f composed with g
of x minus f composed with g of A divided
540:56 - by x minus a. I'll rewrite this slightly.
And now we're going to multiply the top and
540:57 - the bottom by g of x minus g of a, that doesn't
change the value of expression, provided that
540:58 - g of x minus g of A is not zero. That's the
detail on sweeping under the rug here and
540:59 - why this is not a real proof, but just a more
informal explanation. Now if I rearrange things,
541:00 - and rewrite the limit of the product as the
product of the limits, my limit on the right
541:01 - here is just the derivative of g. for the
limit on the left, notice that as x goes to
541:02 - a, g of x has to go to G evey, since G is
differentiable on there for a continuous function,
541:03 - so I can rewrite this and letting say u be
equal to g of x, I can rewrite this as the
541:04 - limit as u goes to g of a of f of u minus
f of g of A
541:05 - over
541:06 - over
541:07 - u minus g of a. Now my expression on the left
is just another way of writing the derivative
541:08 - of f evaluated at G Ave. And I've arrived
at the expression for the chain rule. Let
541:09 - me just emphasize again, this is just a pseudo
proof it's not quite airtight because g of
541:10 - x minus g of a might be zero. That's all for
the justification of the chain rule. For a
541:11 - complete proof. Please see the textbook implicit
differentiation is a technique for finding
541:12 - the slopes of tangent lines for curves that
are defined indirectly, and sometimes aren't
541:13 - even functions. So far, we've developed a
lot of techniques for finding derivatives
541:14 - of functions defined explicitly, in terms
of the equation y equals something. In this
541:15 - section, we'll consider curves that are defined
implicitly, in terms of any equation involving
541:16 - x's and y's. So the points on this curve are
the values of x and y that satisfy this equation.
541:17 - As you can see, when you have implicitly defined
curves, they are not necessarily functions.
541:18 - And in fact, they can not only violate the
vertical line test, but they can cross themselves,
541:19 - or be broken up into several pieces or look
like really cool pictures like this flower.
541:20 - But small pieces of these curves do satisfy
the vertical line test for small pieces, y
541:21 - is a function of x. And that allows us to
use our calculus techniques, especially the
541:22 - chain rule, to compute derivatives for these
implicitly defined curves.
541:23 - u minus g of a. Now my expression on the left
is just another way of writing the derivative

541:28 - the slopes of tangent lines for curves that
are defined indirectly, and sometimes aren't
541:29 - even functions. So far, we've developed a
lot of techniques for finding derivatives
541:30 - of functions defined explicitly, in terms
of the equation y equals something. In this
541:31 - section, we'll consider curves that are defined
implicitly, in terms of any equation involving
541:32 - x's and y's. So the points on this curve are
the values of x and y that satisfy this equation.
541:33 - As you can see, when you have implicitly defined

541:34 - And in fact, they can not only violate the

541:37 - is a function of x. And that allows us to
use our calculus techniques, especially the
541:38 - chain rule, to compute derivatives for these
implicitly defined curves.
541:39 - As usual, the derivative dy dx represents
the slope of a tangent line. For our first
541:40 - example, let's find the equation of the tangent
line for the lips 9x squared plus four y squared
541:41 - equals 25. drawn below at the point, one,
two. From the picture, it looks like the slope
541:42 - of this tangent line should be about negative
one, but let's use calculus to find it exactly.
541:43 - So there are at least two ways we could proceed.
First, we could solve for y, and then use
541:44 - the same techniques that we've been using.
So if we solve for y, we get for y squared
541:45 - equals 25 minus 9x squared. So y squared is
25 minus 9x squared over four, which means
541:46 - that y is plus or minus the square root of
25 minus 9x squared over four, or in other
541:47 - words, plus or minus the square root of 25
minus 9x squared over two, the plus answer
541:48 - is giving us the top half of the ellipse.
And the minus answer is giving us this bottom.
541:49 - Since the point one, two is on the top part
of the ellipse, let's focus on the positive
541:50 - version. And let's take the derivative. But
first, let me rewrite one more time to put
541:51 - it in a slightly easier form, instead of dividing
by two, I'm going to think of multiplying
541:52 - by the constant one half. And instead of taking
the square root, I'm going to write that as
541:53 - an exponent of one half here. So now if I
want to take the y dx, I can pull out the
541:54 - constant of one half. And now I'll start using
the chain rule where my outer function
541:55 - As usual, the derivative dy dx represents
the slope of a tangent line. For our first
541:56 - example, let's find the equation of the tangent
line for the lips 9x squared plus four y squared
541:57 - equals 25. drawn below at the point, one,
two. From the picture, it looks like the slope
541:58 - of this tangent line should be about negative
one, but let's use calculus to find it exactly.
541:59 - So there are at least two ways we could proceed.
First, we could solve for y, and then use
542:00 - the same techniques that we've been using.
So if we solve for y, we get for y squared
542:01 - equals 25 minus 9x squared. So y squared is
25 minus 9x squared over four, which means
542:02 - that y is plus or minus the square root of
25 minus 9x squared over four, or in other
542:03 - words, plus or minus the square root of 25
minus 9x squared over two, the plus answer
542:04 - is giving us the top half of the ellipse.
And the minus answer is giving us this bottom.
542:05 - Since the point one, two is on the top part
of the ellipse, let's focus on the positive
542:06 - version. And let's take the derivative. But
first, let me rewrite one more time to put
542:07 - it in a slightly easier form, instead of dividing
by two, I'm going to think of multiplying
542:08 - by the constant one half. And instead of taking
the square root, I'm going to write that as
542:09 - an exponent of one half here. So now if I
want to take the y dx, I can pull out the
542:10 - constant of one half. And now I'll start using
the chain rule where my outer function
542:11 - is
542:12 - is
542:13 - taking things to the one half power, and my
inner function is 25 minus 9x squared. So
542:14 - I'll take the derivative of my outer function
by bringing the one half down, taking the
542:15 - inner function to the negative one half. Now
I multiply by the derivative of the inner
542:16 - function, which is negative 18x. If I simplify
a little bit, I get D y dX is negative 18x
542:17 - over four times 25 minus 9x squared to the
one half power, or in other words, dy dx is
542:18 - negative 9x over two times the square root
of 25 minus 9x squared. This formula only
542:19 - holds for the top half of the ellipse for
the bottom half, we would need to use the
542:20 - negative. Now I want to evaluate the derivative
at the point one, two, so I'm going to take
542:21 - dydx. When x equals one, I get negative nine
over two times the square root of 25 minus
542:22 - nine, which is negative nine eighths. Since
I've found the slope of the tangent line,
542:23 - and I know that point one, two is a point
on the tangent line, I can now use the point
542:24 - slope form to write down the equation of the
tangent line. simplified this becomes y equals
542:25 - negative nine is x plus nine eights plus two,
or y equals negative nine, it's x plus 25.
542:26 - It's now that we've solved the problem once
using a familiar method. Let's go back to
542:27 - the beginning and solve it again using a new
method. method two is implicit differentiation.
542:28 - The idea is that I'm going to take the derivative
with respect to x of both sides. If my equation
542:29 - without having to solve for y, I can rewrite
the left side as nine times the derivative
542:30 - of x squared plus four times the derivative
of y squared. And the right side, the derivative
542:31 - of a constant is zero. Going back to the left
side, the derivative of x squared with respect
542:32 - to x is 2x. Now for the derivative of y squared
with respect to x, I'm going to need to use
542:33 - the chain rule, I'm going to think of taking
the squared power as my outside function,
542:34 - I'm going to think of y itself as my inside
function, my inside function of x. Even though
542:35 - my entire curve is not a function, for small
pieces of it, y is a function of x, so I can
542:36 - get away with doing this, the derivative of
my outside function y squared is to y, and
542:37 - the derivative of my inside function, y as
a function of x is just dydx. Now I can solve
542:38 - for dy dx, which is going to tell me the slope
of my tangent line. And so I get negative
542:39 - 18x from here, divided by eight y from here,
which simplifies to negative nine fourths
542:40 - times X over Y. Notice that the formula for
my derivative dydx has both x's and y's in
542:41 - it. Of course, for this problem, if I wanted
to, I could solve for y in terms of x using
542:42 - the original equation like I did in method
one, and plug that in for y and get an expression
542:43 - entirely in terms of x, which should be the
same as the expression I got previously.
542:44 - taking things to the one half power, and my
inner function is 25 minus 9x squared. So
542:45 - I'll take the derivative of my outer function
by bringing the one half down, taking the
542:46 - inner function to the negative one half. Now
I multiply by the derivative of the inner
542:47 - function, which is negative 18x. If I simplify
a little bit, I get D y dX is negative 18x
542:48 - over four times 25 minus 9x squared to the
one half power, or in other words, dy dx is
542:49 - negative 9x over two times the square root
of 25 minus 9x squared. This formula only
542:50 - holds for the top half of the ellipse for
the bottom half, we would need to use the
542:51 - negative. Now I want to evaluate the derivative
at the point one, two, so I'm going to take
542:52 - dydx. When x equals one, I get negative nine
over two times the square root of 25 minus
542:53 - nine, which is negative nine eighths. Since
I've found the slope of the tangent line,
542:54 - and I know that point one, two is a point
on the tangent line, I can now use the point
542:55 - slope form to write down the equation of the
tangent line. simplified this becomes y equals
542:56 - negative nine is x plus nine eights plus two,
or y equals negative nine, it's x plus 25.
542:57 - It's now that we've solved the problem once
using a familiar method. Let's go back to
542:58 - the beginning and solve it again using a new
method. method two is implicit differentiation.
542:59 - The idea is that I'm going to take the derivative
with respect to x of both sides. If my equation
543:00 - without having to solve for y, I can rewrite
the left side as nine times the derivative
543:01 - of x squared plus four times the derivative
of y squared. And the right side, the derivative
543:02 - of a constant is zero. Going back to the left
side, the derivative of x squared with respect
543:03 - to x is 2x. Now for the derivative of y squared
with respect to x, I'm going to need to use
543:04 - the chain rule, I'm going to think of taking
the squared power as my outside function,
543:05 - I'm going to think of y itself as my inside
function, my inside function of x. Even though
543:06 - my entire curve is not a function, for small
pieces of it, y is a function of x, so I can
543:07 - get away with doing this, the derivative of
my outside function y squared is to y, and
543:08 - the derivative of my inside function, y as
a function of x is just dydx. Now I can solve
543:09 - for dy dx, which is going to tell me the slope
of my tangent line. And so I get negative
543:10 - 18x from here, divided by eight y from here,
which simplifies to negative nine fourths
543:11 - times X over Y. Notice that the formula for
my derivative dydx has both x's and y's in
543:12 - it. Of course, for this problem, if I wanted
to, I could solve for y in terms of x using
543:13 - the original equation like I did in method
one, and plug that in for y and get an expression
543:14 - entirely in terms of x, which should be the
same as the expression I got previously.
543:15 - But I don't really
543:16 - But I don't really
543:17 - need to do that in order to solve this problem.
Instead, I can just plug in the x value of
543:18 - one and the y value of two to get dy dx at
x equals one, equal to negative nine fourths,
543:19 - times one half or negative nine, eight, which
we'll recognize as the same answer we got
543:20 - before. So as before, we can compute the equation
for the tangent line. And we'll again get
543:21 - y equals negative nine 8x plus 25, eights.
In this example, implicit differentiation
543:22 - was a convenient way to find the derivative.
But it was possible to solve for y and use
543:23 - standard methods instead. But in many examples,
like the next one, it's not possible to solve
543:24 - for y directly. And so implicit differentiation
is the only way to go. implicit differentiation
543:25 - is definitely the key to finding y prime for
this curve defined implicitly. So again, the
543:26 - idea is to take the derivative of both sides
with respect to x, I can break this up into
543:27 - pieces. And now use the product rule for the
first piece. So I get the first function x
543:28 - cubed times the derivative of the second function
y squared, the derivative of y squared is
543:29 - to y, d y dx, don't forget the dydx there,
because y is a function of x plus the derivative
543:30 - of the first part 3x squared times the second
part
543:31 - need to do that in order to solve this problem.
Instead, I can just plug in the x value of
543:32 - one and the y value of two to get dy dx at
x equals one, equal to negative nine fourths,
543:33 - times one half or negative nine, eight, which
we'll recognize as the same answer we got
543:34 - before. So as before, we can compute the equation
for the tangent line. And we'll again get
543:35 - y equals negative nine 8x plus 25, eights.
In this example, implicit differentiation
543:36 - was a convenient way to find the derivative.
But it was possible to solve for y and use
543:37 - standard methods instead. But in many examples,
like the next one, it's not possible to solve
543:38 - for y directly. And so implicit differentiation
is the only way to go. implicit differentiation
543:39 - is definitely the key to finding y prime for
this curve defined implicitly. So again, the
543:40 - idea is to take the derivative of both sides
with respect to x, I can break this up into
543:41 - pieces. And now use the product rule for the
first piece. So I get the first function x
543:42 - cubed times the derivative of the second function
y squared, the derivative of y squared is
543:43 - to y, d y dx, don't forget the dydx there,
because y is a function of x plus the derivative
543:44 - of the first part 3x squared times the second
part
543:45 - y squared.
543:46 - y squared.
543:47 - Next, I need to take the derivative of sine
x, y on the do use the chain rule here. So
543:48 - the derivative of the outside sine is cosine.
And now I need to take the derivative of the
543:49 - inside x times y. And that's going to be a
product rule application. So x times D y dX,
543:50 - plus the derivative of x, which is just one
times y. That all was just my left hand side.
543:51 - But fortunately, my right hand side is easier.
The derivative of x cubed with respect to
543:52 - x is 3x squared. And the derivative of y cubed
with respect to x is three y squared, dy dx.
543:53 - Now I need to solve for the y dx. And since
it's scattered all over the place in three
543:54 - different places, I'm first going to distribute
out to free it from these parentheses, and
543:55 - then I'll try to move all the dydx is to the
left side. So distributing out I get, I get
543:56 - this expression. And now moving alternatives
with dydx and add them to the left side and
543:57 - all terms without dydx mm to the right side.
I'm going to get this expression here. Now
543:58 - I'm going to factor out the dy dx. I'm just
using standard algebra techniques here. And
543:59 - finally, I can just divide both sides by all
this mess, too. isolate the dydx. And I found
544:00 - my derivative using implicit differentiation.
This video talked about using implicit differentiation
544:01 - to find the slopes of tangent lines for curves
defined implicitly, the main two steps, were
544:02 - first to take the derivative of both sides
with respect to x. And then to solve for dy
544:03 - dx. This video is about finding the derivatives
of exponential functions, we've already seen
544:04 - that the derivative of the exponential function,
e to the x is just itself, e to the x. But
544:05 - what's the derivative of an exponential function
with a different base, like five to the x,
544:06 - one way to find the derivative of an exponential
function like five to the X is to write five
544:07 - as e to a power. So five, is the same thing
as e to the ln five, where ln is the natural
544:08 - log or the log base. See, this makes sense
because ln five, which is the same thing as
544:09 - log base e of five, means the power that we
raise E to to get five. So now if we take
544:10 - e to the ln five, that means we raise e to
the power that we raise E to to get five?
544:11 - Well, when you raise E to that power, you
get five. All right, if five is the same thing
544:12 - as e to the ln five, then that means if we
take five to the x, that's the same thing
544:13 - as e to the ln five raised to the x power
BI properties of exponents, when I take a
544:14 - power to a power, I multiply the exponents.
so this can be written as e to the ln five
544:15 - times x. Now I want to take the derivative
with respect to x of five to the x. So by
544:16 - my rewriting trick, that's the same thing
as taking the derivative with respect to x
544:17 - of e to the ln five times x. Now we know how
to calculate this using the chain rule, we
544:18 - can think of e to the power as our outside
function, and ln five times x as our inside
544:19 - function. So now by the chain rule, I take
the derivative of the outside function e to
544:20 - the power, and that's just gives me e to the
power evaluated on the inside function. So
544:21 - I stick ln five times x as my inside function,
and by the chain rule, I multiply that by
544:22 - the derivative of the inside function, ln
five times x. Five is a constant. So let me
544:23 - copy over first part, the derivative of a
constant times x is just the constant. Let
544:24 - me rewrite this a little bit. So e to the
ln five times x is the same thing as e to
544:25 - the ln five to the x power, just like before,
because the exponent rules say, when I take
544:26 - a power to a power, I multiply the exponent,
and remember, is the LL five, it's just a
544:27 - fancy way of writing five. So I've got five
to the x times ln five as the derivative with
544:28 - respect to x of five to the x. The same argument
works not just for a base five exponential
544:29 - function, but for any base exponential function.
So if I take the respect to x of A to the
544:30 - X for any number A, I'm going to get
544:31 - Next, I need to take the derivative of sine
x, y on the do use the chain rule here. So
544:32 - the derivative of the outside sine is cosine.
And now I need to take the derivative of the
544:33 - inside x times y. And that's going to be a
product rule application. So x times D y dX,
544:34 - plus the derivative of x, which is just one
times y. That all was just my left hand side.
544:35 - But fortunately, my right hand side is easier.
The derivative of x cubed with respect to
544:36 - x is 3x squared. And the derivative of y cubed
with respect to x is three y squared, dy dx.
544:37 - Now I need to solve for the y dx. And since
it's scattered all over the place in three

544:55 - Well, when you raise E to that power, you

544:57 - as e to the ln five raised to the x power
BI properties of exponents, when I take a
544:58 - power to a power, I multiply the exponents.
so this can be written as e to the ln five
544:59 - times x. Now I want to take the derivative
with respect to x of five to the x. So by
545:00 - my rewriting trick, that's the same thing
as taking the derivative with respect to x
545:01 - of e to the ln five times x. Now we know how
to calculate this using the chain rule, we
545:02 - can think of e to the power as our outside

to the x times ln five as the derivative with
545:12 - respect to x of five to the x. The same argument
works not just for a base five exponential
545:13 - function, but for any base exponential function.
So if I take the respect to x of A to the
545:14 - X for any number A, I'm going to get
545:15 - a to the x times ln A. Now, you might be wondering,
what if I use the same roll on our old favorite
545:16 - e to the x. So our base here is E. That means
I should get e to the x times ln e? Wait a
545:17 - sec, ln E, that's log base e of E, that's
asking what power? Do I raise II today get
545:18 - he? Well, the answer there is one. And so
the derivative respect to x of e to the x
545:19 - by this new rule we have is e to the x, it
agrees with our old rule. I want to draw your
545:20 - attention to the difference between two expressions.
And the first expression, dy dx of a to the
545:21 - x, the variable that we're taking the derivative
with respect to is in the exponent. So for
545:22 - this exponential function, or we use the derivative
rule that we just found, dy dx of a dx is
545:23 - eight of the x times ln A. On the other hand,
if we take respect to x of x to the A, where
545:24 - the variable x that we're taking the derivative
with respect to is in the base, then we don't
545:25 - need this exponential rule. In fact, it doesn't
even apply, although we have here is the power
545:26 - rule, right? dy dx of x cubed would be 3x
squared dy dx of x to the seventh would be
545:27 - 7x to the sixth and enjoy Add x of x to the
a is just a times x to the A minus one by
545:28 - the power role. So it's important to pay attention
to where the variable is when you're taking
545:29 - a derivative. In this video, we found that
the derivative with respect to x of five to
545:30 - the x is given by ln five times five to the
x. And in general, the derivative of respect
545:31 - to x of A to the X is going to be ln a times
a to the x. This gives us a general formula
545:32 - for the derivative of exponential functions.
The main goal of this video is to figure out
545:33 - the derivatives of logarithmic functions,
functions like y equals ln x, or y equals
545:34 - log base A x for any positive base a, I want
to find the derivative of log base a of x.
545:35 - In other words, I want to find the derivative
of y, where y is log base a of x. By the definition
545:36 - of logarithms, log base a of x equals y means
that a to the Y power is equal to x. And that's
545:37 - useful because now I can take the derivative
of both sides and use implicit differentiation.
545:38 - Recall of the derivative of a to the power
is ln A times A to the power. But since why
545:39 - we're thinking of as a function of x, I have
to multiply that by dou y dx by the chain
545:40 - rule. The right hand side here is just one.
Solving for dydx, I get one over ln A times
545:41 - A to the Y. But since age the y is equal to
x, I can rewrite that as the y dx equals one
545:42 - over ln A times x. So the derivative of log
base a of x for any base a is one over ln
545:43 - of A times x. And in particular, the derivative
of natural log of x is one over ln of E times
545:44 - x. But since ln of E is just one, that saying
that the derivative of ln x is one over x,
545:45 - this is a very handy fact. And this more general
derivative is also worth memorizing. While
545:46 - we're talking about the derivative of the
natural log of x, let's look at the derivative
545:47 - of the natural log of the absolute value of
x. The function y equals ln of absolute value
545:48 - of x is of course closely related to the function
y equals ln of x, the difference being that
545:49 - the domain for ln x is just x values greater
than zero, whereas the domain of ln of absolute
545:50 - value of x is all X's not equal to zero. The
graphs are also related. When you look at
545:51 - the graph of y equals ln absolute value of
x, it looks like you're seeing double since
545:52 - the absolute value of x is equal to x, when
x is greater than or equal to zero and negative
545:53 - x when x is less than zero, ln of the absolute
value of x is going to be equal to ln x when
545:54 - x is greater than or equal to zero, and ln
of negative x when x is less than zero. If
545:55 - I consider the derivative of ln of absolute
value of x, I can think of taking the derivative
545:56 - of each piece separately. We just saw that
the derivative of ln x is one over x. So the
545:57 - derivative of ln of minus x is going to be
one over minus x times the derivative of minus
545:58 - x, which is minus one by the chain rule. Notice
that this second expression simplifies to
545:59 - one over x. So the derivative of ln of absolute
value of x is equal to one over x, whether
546:00 - x is positive or negative. This formula will
come in handy later when we start doing integrals.
546:01 - In this video, we found that the derivative
of ln x is equal to one over x, kind of a
546:02 - nice derivative. And more generally, the derivative
of log base a of x is one over ln A times
546:03 - x. We've seen previously that the derivative
of x to a constant A is equal to a times x
546:04 - to the A minus one. This is the power rule.
We've also seen that the derivative of a positive
546:05 - number a raised to the x power is equal to
ln A times A to the X So we know how to take
546:06 - the derivative when the variable x is in the
base, or when it's in the exponent. But what
546:07 - if the variables in both the base and the
exponent, how do we take the derivative of
546:08 - x to the x. To differentiate functions like
this, we'll need to use the technique of logarithmic
546:09 - differentiation. To find the derivative of
x to the x, I'm going to set y equal to x
546:10 - to the x. Now we want to find dy dx. Since
we don't know how to compute dydx directly,
546:11 - so let's take the natural log of both sides.
taking the log is often a handy trick when
546:12 - you have a variable in the exponent that you
don't know how to deal with, because the properties
546:13 - of logs allow us to bring that exponent down
and multiply it. Now we have y implicitly
546:14 - defined in terms of x, so let's use implicit
differentiation, we'll take the derivative
546:15 - of both sides with respect to x. And now we
should have no trouble taking the derivatives
546:16 - because we've gotten rid of the awkward exponential
expression. So the derivative on the left
546:17 - of ln y is one over y times dy dx. And the
derivative on the right using the product
546:18 - rule is x times one over x plus one times
ln x.
546:19 - a to the x times ln A. Now, you might be wondering,
what if I use the same roll on our old favorite
546:20 - e to the x. So our base here is E. That means
I should get e to the x times ln e? Wait a
546:21 - sec, ln E, that's log base e of E, that's
asking what power? Do I raise II today get
546:22 - he? Well, the answer there is one. And so
the derivative respect to x of e to the x
546:23 - by this new rule we have is e to the x, it
agrees with our old rule. I want to draw your
546:24 - attention to the difference between two expressions.
And the first expression, dy dx of a to the
546:25 - x, the variable that we're taking the derivative
with respect to is in the exponent. So for
546:26 - this exponential function, or we use the derivative
rule that we just found, dy dx of a dx is
546:27 - eight of the x times ln A. On the other hand,
if we take respect to x of x to the A, where
546:28 - the variable x that we're taking the derivative
with respect to is in the base, then we don't
546:29 - need this exponential rule. In fact, it doesn't
even apply, although we have here is the power
546:30 - rule, right? dy dx of x cubed would be 3x
squared dy dx of x to the seventh would be
546:31 - 7x to the sixth and enjoy Add x of x to the
a is just a times x to the A minus one by
546:32 - the power role. So it's important to pay attention
to where the variable is when you're taking
546:33 - a derivative. In this video, we found that
the derivative with respect to x of five to
546:34 - the x is given by ln five times five to the
x. And in general, the derivative of respect
546:35 - to x of A to the X is going to be ln a times
a to the x. This gives us a general formula
546:36 - for the derivative of exponential functions.
The main goal of this video is to figure out
546:37 - the derivatives of logarithmic functions,
functions like y equals ln x, or y equals
546:38 - log base A x for any positive base a, I want
to find the derivative of log base a of x.
546:39 - In other words, I want to find the derivative
of y, where y is log base a of x. By the definition
546:40 - of logarithms, log base a of x equals y means
that a to the Y power is equal to x. And that's
546:41 - useful because now I can take the derivative
of both sides and use implicit differentiation.
546:42 - Recall of the derivative of a to the power
is ln A times A to the power. But since why

base a of x for any base a is one over ln
546:47 - of A times x. And in particular, the derivative
of natural log of x is one over ln of E times
546:48 - x. But since ln of E is just one, that saying
that the derivative of ln x is one over x,
546:49 - this is a very handy fact. And this more general
derivative is also worth memorizing. While
546:50 - we're talking about the derivative of the
natural log of x, let's look at the derivative
546:51 - of the natural log of the absolute value of
x. The function y equals ln of absolute value
546:52 - of x is of course closely related to the function
y equals ln of x, the difference being that
546:53 - the domain for ln x is just x values greater
than zero, whereas the domain of ln of absolute
546:54 - value of x is all X's not equal to zero. The
graphs are also related. When you look at
546:55 - the graph of y equals ln absolute value of
x, it looks like you're seeing double since
546:56 - the absolute value of x is equal to x, when
x is greater than or equal to zero and negative
546:57 - x when x is less than zero, ln of the absolute
value of x is going to be equal to ln x when
546:58 - x is greater than or equal to zero, and ln
of negative x when x is less than zero. If
546:59 - I consider the derivative of ln of absolute
value of x, I can think of taking the derivative
547:00 - of each piece separately. We just saw that
the derivative of ln x is one over x. So the
547:01 - derivative of ln of minus x is going to be
one over minus x times the derivative of minus
547:02 - x, which is minus one by the chain rule. Notice
that this second expression simplifies to
547:03 - one over x. So the derivative of ln of absolute
value of x is equal to one over x, whether
547:04 - x is positive or negative. This formula will
come in handy later when we start doing integrals.
547:05 - In this video, we found that the derivative
of ln x is equal to one over x, kind of a
547:06 - nice derivative. And more generally, the derivative
of log base a of x is one over ln A times
547:07 - x. We've seen previously that the derivative
of x to a constant A is equal to a times x
547:08 - to the A minus one. This is the power rule.
We've also seen that the derivative of a positive
547:09 - number a raised to the x power is equal to
ln A times A to the X So we know how to take
547:10 - the derivative when the variable x is in the
base, or when it's in the exponent. But what
547:11 - if the variables in both the base and the
exponent, how do we take the derivative of
547:12 - x to the x. To differentiate functions like
this, we'll need to use the technique of logarithmic
547:13 - differentiation. To find the derivative of
x to the x, I'm going to set y equal to x
547:14 - to the x. Now we want to find dy dx. Since
we don't know how to compute dydx directly,
547:15 - so let's take the natural log of both sides.
taking the log is often a handy trick when
547:16 - you have a variable in the exponent that you
don't know how to deal with, because the properties
547:17 - of logs allow us to bring that exponent down
and multiply it. Now we have y implicitly
547:18 - defined in terms of x, so let's use implicit
differentiation, we'll take the derivative
547:19 - of both sides with respect to x. And now we
should have no trouble taking the derivatives
547:20 - because we've gotten rid of the awkward exponential
expression. So the derivative on the left
547:21 - of ln y is one over y times dy dx. And the
derivative on the right using the product
547:22 - rule is x times one over x plus one times
ln x.
547:23 - This simplifies to one over y d y dx equals
one plus ln x. So D y dX is going to equal
547:24 - y times one plus ln x. and replacing y with
x to the x, I have dy dx is x to the x times
547:25 - one plus ln x. This technique of taking the
log of both sides differentiating and solving
547:26 - for dydx is known as logarithmic differentiation.
And it's enormously useful whenever you have
547:27 - variables in both the base and the exponent.
Here's another example where our variable
547:28 - is in both the base and the exponent. So as
before, I'm going to set y equal to the expression
547:29 - that I want to differentiate and compute dydx.
First, I'll take the log of both sides. Use
547:30 - my log rules to bring my exponent down and
multiply it and take the derivative of both
547:31 - sides with respect to x. On the left, I get
one over y d y dx. And on the right, I get
547:32 - one of our x times the derivative of ln tangent
x, which is one over tangent x times the derivative
547:33 - of tangent x, or secant squared x, continuing
with the product rule, and didn't take the
547:34 - derivative of one of our x, that's going to
be the derivative of x to the minus one, which
547:35 - is minus one times x to the minus
547:36 - This simplifies to one over y d y dx equals
one plus ln x. So D y dX is going to equal
547:37 - y times one plus ln x. and replacing y with
x to the x, I have dy dx is x to the x times
547:38 - one plus ln x. This technique of taking the
log of both sides differentiating and solving
547:39 - for dydx is known as logarithmic differentiation.
And it's enormously useful whenever you have
547:40 - variables in both the base and the exponent.
Here's another example where our variable
547:41 - is in both the base and the exponent. So as
before, I'm going to set y equal to the expression
547:42 - that I want to differentiate and compute dydx.
First, I'll take the log of both sides. Use
547:43 - my log rules to bring my exponent down and
multiply it and take the derivative of both
547:44 - sides with respect to x. On the left, I get
one over y d y dx. And on the right, I get
547:45 - one of our x times the derivative of ln tangent
x, which is one over tangent x times the derivative
547:46 - of tangent x, or secant squared x, continuing
with the product rule, and didn't take the
547:47 - derivative of one of our x, that's going to
be the derivative of x to the minus one, which
547:48 - is minus one times x to the minus
547:49 - two
547:50 - two
547:51 - times ln tangent of x. Simplifying the right
hand side, I get one over x times one over
547:52 - sine x over cosine x times one over cosine
squared x minus ln 10x over x squared. rewriting,
547:53 - I can flip and multiply to get one over x
times cosine x over sine x times one over
547:54 - cosine squared x minus the second term, canceling
one copy of cosine and rewriting in terms
547:55 - of cosecant and secant, I get this expression,
I still have to solve for dy dx.
547:56 - times ln tangent of x. Simplifying the right
hand side, I get one over x times one over
547:57 - sine x over cosine x times one over cosine
squared x minus ln 10x over x squared. rewriting,
547:58 - I can flip and multiply to get one over x
times cosine x over sine x times one over
547:59 - cosine squared x minus the second term, canceling
one copy of cosine and rewriting in terms
548:00 - of cosecant and secant, I get this expression,
I still have to solve for dy dx.
548:01 - So multiplying both sides by y, I get the
following. And since y was equal to 10x to
548:02 - the one over x, I can rewrite everything in
terms of x. The technique of logarithmic differentiation
548:03 - is most useful when taking the derivative
of an expression that has a variable in both
548:04 - the base and the exponent, like in this example,
but sometimes it's also handy just as a way
548:05 - to take the derivative of a complicated product
and quotient like in this example. Now, we
548:06 - could take the derivative here just by using
the quotient rule on the product rule, but
548:07 - it's a little easier to take the log of both
sides. And the reason is that when we take
548:08 - the log of a product, we get a sum and the
log of a quotient is a difference and sums
548:09 - and quotients are a lot easier to deal with.
So in this example, the log of y is equal
548:10 - to ln of x plus ln of cosine of x minus ln
of x squared plus x to the fifth power, I
548:11 - can even bring that fifth power down, because
that's another one of my log roles. Now, it's
548:12 - much more straightforward to take the log
of both sides. On the left, I have one over
548:13 - y dydx, as usual, and on the right, the derivative
of ln x is one over x, the derivative of ln
548:14 - cosine x is one over cosine of x times negative
sine of x. And the derivative of ln x squared
548:15 - plus x is one over x squared plus x times
2x plus one. I'll solve for dydx and get y
548:16 - times one over x minus sine x over cosine
x, that's the same as tangent x minus five
548:17 - times 2x plus one over x squared plus x. Now
I can just rewrite y in terms of x and I'll
548:18 - be done. Again, I didn't have to use logarithmic
differentiation. To find this derivative,
548:19 - I could have just used the product rule in
the quotient rule, but logarithmic differentiation
548:20 - made it computationally much easier. In this
video, we learned how to take the derivative
548:21 - of expressions that have a variable both in
the base and in the exponent. And the idea
548:22 - was first to set y equal to the expression
we want to derive. Next, to take the natural
548:23 - log of both sides. Next, to derive both sides.
And finally, to solve for dy dx. This process
548:24 - is called logarithmic differentiation. The
inverse of a function undoes what the function
548:25 - does, so the inverse of tying your shoes would
be to untie them. And the inverse of the function
548:26 - that adds two to a number would be the function
that subtracts two from a number. This video
548:27 - introduces inverses and their properties.
Suppose f of x is the function defined by
548:28 - this chart. In other words, f of two is three,
f of three is five, f of four is six, and
548:29 - f of five is one, the inverse function for
F written f superscript. Negative 1x undoes
548:30 - what f does. Since f takes two to three, F
inverse takes three back to two. So we write
548:31 - this f superscript, negative one of three
is two. Similarly, since f takes three to
548:32 - five, F inverse takes five to three. And since
f takes four to six, f inverse of six is four.
548:33 - And since f takes five to one, f inverse of
one is five. I'll use these numbers to fill
548:34 - in the chart. Notice that the chart of values
when y equals f of x and the chart of values
548:35 - when y equals f inverse of x are closely related.
They share the same numbers, but the x values
548:36 - for f of x correspond to the y values for
f inverse of x, and the y values for f of
548:37 - x correspond to the x values for f inverse
of x. That leads us to the first key fact
548:38 - inverse functions reverse the roles of y and
x. I'm going to plot the points for y equals
548:39 - f of x in blue.
548:40 - So multiplying both sides by y, I get the
following. And since y was equal to 10x to
548:41 - the one over x, I can rewrite everything in
terms of x. The technique of logarithmic differentiation
548:42 - is most useful when taking the derivative
of an expression that has a variable in both
548:43 - the base and the exponent, like in this example,
but sometimes it's also handy just as a way

548:47 - the log of a product, we get a sum and the
log of a quotient is a difference and sums
548:48 - and quotients are a lot easier to deal with.
So in this example, the log of y is equal
548:49 - to ln of x plus ln of cosine of x minus ln
of x squared plus x to the fifth power, I
548:50 - can even bring that fifth power down, because
that's another one of my log roles. Now, it's
548:51 - much more straightforward to take the log
of both sides. On the left, I have one over
548:52 - y dydx, as usual, and on the right, the derivative
of ln x is one over x, the derivative of ln
548:53 - cosine x is one over cosine of x times negative
sine of x. And the derivative of ln x squared
548:54 - plus x is one over x squared plus x times
2x plus one. I'll solve for dydx and get y
548:55 - times one over x minus sine x over cosine
x, that's the same as tangent x minus five
548:56 - times 2x plus one over x squared plus x. Now
I can just rewrite y in terms of x and I'll
548:57 - be done. Again, I didn't have to use logarithmic
differentiation. To find this derivative,
548:58 - I could have just used the product rule in
the quotient rule, but logarithmic differentiation
548:59 - made it computationally much easier. In this
video, we learned how to take the derivative
549:00 - of expressions that have a variable both in
the base and in the exponent. And the idea
549:01 - was first to set y equal to the expression
we want to derive. Next, to take the natural

And finally, to solve for dy dx. This process

Suppose f of x is the function defined by

f takes four to six, f inverse of six is four.
549:12 - And since f takes five to one, f inverse of
one is five. I'll use these numbers to fill
549:13 - in the chart. Notice that the chart of values
when y equals f of x and the chart of values
549:14 - when y equals f inverse of x are closely related.
They share the same numbers, but the x values
549:15 - for f of x correspond to the y values for
f inverse of x, and the y values for f of
549:16 - x correspond to the x values for f inverse
of x. That leads us to the first key fact
549:17 - inverse functions reverse the roles of y and
x. I'm going to plot the points for y equals
549:18 - f of x in blue.
549:19 - Next, I'll plot the points for y equals f
inverse of x in red. Pause the video for a
549:20 - moment and see what kind of symmetry you observe
in this graph. How are the blue points related
549:21 - to the red points, you might have noticed
that the blue points and the red points are
549:22 - mirror images over the mirror line, y equals
x. So our second key fact is that the graph
549:23 - of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained
from the graph of y equals f of x by reflecting
549:24 - over the line y equals x. This makes sense,
because inverses, reverse the roles of y and
549:25 - x. In the same example, let's compute f inverse
of f of two. This open circle means composition.
549:26 - In other words, we're computing f inverse
of f of two. We compute this from the inside
549:27 - out. So that's f inverse of three. Since F
of two is three, and f inverse of three, we
549:28 - see is two. Similarly, we can compute f of
f inverse of three. And that means we take
549:29 - f of f inverse of three. Since f inverse of
three is two, that's the same thing as computing
549:30 - F of two, which is three. Please pause the
video for a moment and compute these other
549:31 - compositions. You should have found that in
every case, if you take f inverse of f of
549:32 - a number, you get back to the very same number
you started with. And similarly, if you take
549:33 - f of f inverse of any number, you get back
to the same number you started with. So in
549:34 - general, f inverse of f of x is equal to x,
and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x.
549:35 - This is the mathematical way of saying that
F and envir f inverse undo each other. Let's
549:36 - look at a different example. Suppose that
f of x is x cubed. Pause the video for a moment
549:37 - and guess what the inverse of f should be?
Remember, F inverse undoes the work that F
549:38 - does. You might have guessed that f inverse
of x is going to be the cube root function.
549:39 - And we can check that this is true by looking
at f of f inverse of x, that's F of the cube
549:40 - root of function, which means the cube root
function cubed, which gets us back to x. Similarly,
549:41 - if we compute f inverse of f of x, that's
the cube root of x cubed. And we get back
549:42 - to excellence again. So the cube root function
really is the inverse of the cubing function.
549:43 - When we compose the two functions, we get
back to the number that we started with. It'd
549:44 - be nice to have a more systematic way of finding
inverses of functions besides guessing and
549:45 - checking. One method uses the fact that inverses,
reverse the roles of y and x. So if we want
549:46 - to find the inverse of the function, f of
x equals five minus x over 3x, we can write
549:47 - it as y equals five minus x over 3x. Reverse
the roles of y and x to get x equals five
549:48 - minus y over three y, and then solve for y.
To solve for y, let's multiply both sides
549:49 - by three y. Bring all terms with wisened to
the left side, and alternans without y's and
549:50 - then to the right side, factor out the y and
divide to isolate y. This gives us f inverse
549:51 - of x as five over 3x plus one. Notice that
our original function f and our inverse function,
549:52 - f inverse are both rational functions, but
they're not the reciprocals of each other.
549:53 - And then General, f inverse of x is not usually
equal to one over f of x. This can be confusing,
549:54 - because when we write two to the minus one,
that does mean one of our two, but f to the
549:55 - minus one of x means the inverse function
and not the reciprocal. It's natural to ask
549:56 - if all functions have inverse functions, that
is for any function you might encounter. Is
549:57 - there always a function that it is its inverse?
549:58 - Next, I'll plot the points for y equals f
inverse of x in red. Pause the video for a
549:59 - moment and see what kind of symmetry you observe
in this graph. How are the blue points related
550:00 - to the red points, you might have noticed
that the blue points and the red points are
550:01 - mirror images over the mirror line, y equals
x. So our second key fact is that the graph
550:02 - of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained
from the graph of y equals f of x by reflecting
550:03 - over the line y equals x. This makes sense,
because inverses, reverse the roles of y and
550:04 - x. In the same example, let's compute f inverse
of f of two. This open circle means composition.
550:05 - In other words, we're computing f inverse
of f of two. We compute this from the inside
550:06 - out. So that's f inverse of three. Since F
of two is three, and f inverse of three, we
550:07 - see is two. Similarly, we can compute f of
f inverse of three. And that means we take
550:08 - f of f inverse of three. Since f inverse of
three is two, that's the same thing as computing
550:09 - F of two, which is three. Please pause the
video for a moment and compute these other
550:10 - compositions. You should have found that in
every case, if you take f inverse of f of
550:11 - a number, you get back to the very same number
you started with. And similarly, if you take
550:12 - f of f inverse of any number, you get back
to the same number you started with. So in
550:13 - general, f inverse of f of x is equal to x,
and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x.
550:14 - This is the mathematical way of saying that
F and envir f inverse undo each other. Let's
550:15 - look at a different example. Suppose that
f of x is x cubed. Pause the video for a moment
550:16 - and guess what the inverse of f should be?
Remember, F inverse undoes the work that F
550:17 - does. You might have guessed that f inverse
of x is going to be the cube root function.
550:18 - And we can check that this is true by looking
at f of f inverse of x, that's F of the cube
550:19 - root of function, which means the cube root
function cubed, which gets us back to x. Similarly,
550:20 - if we compute f inverse of f of x, that's
the cube root of x cubed. And we get back
550:21 - to excellence again. So the cube root function
really is the inverse of the cubing function.
550:22 - When we compose the two functions, we get
back to the number that we started with. It'd
550:23 - be nice to have a more systematic way of finding
inverses of functions besides guessing and
550:24 - checking. One method uses the fact that inverses,
reverse the roles of y and x. So if we want
550:25 - to find the inverse of the function, f of
x equals five minus x over 3x, we can write
550:26 - it as y equals five minus x over 3x. Reverse
the roles of y and x to get x equals five
550:27 - minus y over three y, and then solve for y.
To solve for y, let's multiply both sides
550:28 - by three y. Bring all terms with wisened to
the left side, and alternans without y's and
550:29 - then to the right side, factor out the y and
divide to isolate y. This gives us f inverse
550:30 - of x as five over 3x plus one. Notice that
our original function f and our inverse function,
550:31 - f inverse are both rational functions, but
they're not the reciprocals of each other.
550:32 - And then General, f inverse of x is not usually
equal to one over f of x. This can be confusing,
550:33 - because when we write two to the minus one,
that does mean one of our two, but f to the
550:34 - minus one of x means the inverse function
and not the reciprocal. It's natural to ask
550:35 - if all functions have inverse functions, that
is for any function you might encounter. Is
550:36 - there always a function that it is its inverse?
550:37 - In fact, the answer is no. See, if you can
come up with an example of a function that
550:38 - does not have an inverse function. The word
function here is key. Remember that a function
550:39 - is a relationship between x values and y values,
such that for each x value in the domain,
550:40 - there's only one corresponding y value. One
example of a function that does not have an
550:41 - inverse function is the function f of x equals
x squared. To see that, the inverse of this
550:42 - function is not a function. Note that for
the x squared function, the number two and
550:43 - the number negative two, both go to number
four. So if I had an inverse, he would have
550:44 - to send four to both two and negative two.
The inverse would not be a function, it might
550:45 - be easier to understand the problem, when
you look at a graph of y equals x squared.
550:46 - Recall that inverse functions reverse the
roles of y and x and flip the graph over the
550:47 - line y equals x. But when I flipped the green
graph over the line y equals x, I get this
550:48 - red graph. This red graph is not the graph
of a function, because it violates the vertical
550:49 - line test. The reason that violates the vertical
line test is because the original green function
550:50 - violates the horizontal line test, and has
2x values with the same y value. In general,
550:51 - a function f has an inverse function if and
only if the graph of f satisfies the horizontal
550:52 - line test, ie every horizontal line intersects
the graph. In most one point, pause the video
550:53 - for a moment and see which of these four graphs
satisfy the horizontal line test. In other
550:54 - words, which of the four corresponding functions
would have an inverse function, you may have
550:55 - found that graphs A and B, violate the horizontal
line test. So their functions would not have
550:56 - inverse functions. But graph C and D satisfy
the horizontal line test. So these graphs
550:57 - represent functions that do have inverses.
functions that satisfy the horizontal line
550:58 - test are sometimes called One to One functions.
Equivalent way of function is one to one,
550:59 - if for any two different x values, x one and
x two, the y value is f of x one and f of
551:00 - x two are different numbers. Sometimes, as
I said, f is one to one, if, whenever f of
551:01 - x one is equal to f of x two, then x one has
to equal x two. As our last example, let's
551:02 - try to find P inverse of x, where p of x is
the square root of x minus two drawn here.
551:03 - If we graph P inverse on the same axis as
p of x, we get the following graph, simply
551:04 - by flipping over the line y equals x. If we
try to solve the problem, algebraically, we
551:05 - can write y equal to a squared of x minus
two, reverse the roles of y and x and solve
551:06 - for y by squaring both sides and adding two.
Now if we were to graph y equals x squared
551:07 - plus two, that would look like a parabola,
it would look like the red graph was already
551:08 - drawn together with another arm on the left
side. But we know that our actual inverse
551:09 - function consists only of this right arm,
we can specify this algebraically by making
551:10 - the restriction that x has to be bigger than
or equal to zero. This corresponds to the
551:11 - fact that on the original graph, for the square
root of x, y was only greater than or equal
551:12 - to zero. Looking more closely at the domain
and range of P and P inverse, we know that
551:13 - the domain of P is all values of x such that
x minus two is greater than or equal to zero.
551:14 - Since we can't take the square root of a negative
number. This corresponds to x values being
551:15 - greater than or equal to two, or an interval
notation, the interval from two to infinity.
551:16 - The range of P, we can see from the graph
is our y value is greater than or equal to
551:17 - zero, or the interval from zero to infinity.
551:18 - In fact, the answer is no. See, if you can
come up with an example of a function that
551:19 - does not have an inverse function. The word
function here is key. Remember that a function
551:20 - is a relationship between x values and y values,
such that for each x value in the domain,
551:21 - there's only one corresponding y value. One
example of a function that does not have an
551:22 - inverse function is the function f of x equals
x squared. To see that, the inverse of this
551:23 - function is not a function. Note that for
the x squared function, the number two and
551:24 - the number negative two, both go to number
four. So if I had an inverse, he would have
551:25 - to send four to both two and negative two.
The inverse would not be a function, it might
551:26 - be easier to understand the problem, when
you look at a graph of y equals x squared.
551:27 - Recall that inverse functions reverse the
roles of y and x and flip the graph over the
551:28 - line y equals x. But when I flipped the green
graph over the line y equals x, I get this
551:29 - red graph. This red graph is not the graph
of a function, because it violates the vertical
551:30 - line test. The reason that violates the vertical
line test is because the original green function
551:31 - violates the horizontal line test, and has
2x values with the same y value. In general,
551:32 - a function f has an inverse function if and
only if the graph of f satisfies the horizontal
551:33 - line test, ie every horizontal line intersects
the graph. In most one point, pause the video
551:34 - for a moment and see which of these four graphs
satisfy the horizontal line test. In other
551:35 - words, which of the four corresponding functions

551:36 - found that graphs A and B, violate the horizontal

551:37 - inverse functions. But graph C and D satisfy
the horizontal line test. So these graphs
551:38 - represent functions that do have inverses.
functions that satisfy the horizontal line
551:39 - test are sometimes called One to One functions.
Equivalent way of function is one to one,
551:40 - if for any two different x values, x one and
x two, the y value is f of x one and f of
551:41 - x two are different numbers. Sometimes, as
I said, f is one to one, if, whenever f of
551:42 - x one is equal to f of x two, then x one has
to equal x two. As our last example, let's
551:43 - try to find P inverse of x, where p of x is
the square root of x minus two drawn here.
551:44 - If we graph P inverse on the same axis as
p of x, we get the following graph, simply
551:45 - by flipping over the line y equals x. If we
try to solve the problem, algebraically, we
551:46 - can write y equal to a squared of x minus
two, reverse the roles of y and x and solve
551:47 - for y by squaring both sides and adding two.
Now if we were to graph y equals x squared
551:48 - plus two, that would look like a parabola,
it would look like the red graph was already
551:49 - drawn together with another arm on the left
side. But we know that our actual inverse
551:50 - function consists only of this right arm,
we can specify this algebraically by making
551:51 - the restriction that x has to be bigger than
or equal to zero. This corresponds to the
551:52 - fact that on the original graph, for the square
root of x, y was only greater than or equal
551:53 - to zero. Looking more closely at the domain
and range of P and P inverse, we know that
551:54 - the domain of P is all values of x such that
x minus two is greater than or equal to zero.
551:55 - Since we can't take the square root of a negative
number. This corresponds to x values being
551:56 - greater than or equal to two, or an interval
notation, the interval from two to infinity.
551:57 - The range of P, we can see from the graph
is our y value is greater than or equal to
551:58 - zero, or the interval from zero to infinity.
551:59 - Similarly, based on the graph, we see the
domain of P inverse is x values greater than
552:00 - or equal to zero, the interval from zero to
infinity. And the range of P inverse is Y
552:01 - values greater than or equal to two, or the
interval from two to infinity. If you look
552:02 - closely at these domains and ranges, you'll
notice that the domain of P corresponds exactly
552:03 - to the range of P inverse, and the range of
P corresponds to the domain of P inverse.
552:04 - This makes sense because inverse functions
reverse the roles of y and x. The domain of
552:05 - f inverse of x is the x values for F inverse,
which corresponds to the y values or the range
552:06 - of F. The range of f inverse is the y values
for F inverse, which correspond to the x values
552:07 - or the domain of f. In this video, we discussed
552:08 - Similarly, based on the graph, we see the
domain of P inverse is x values greater than
552:09 - or equal to zero, the interval from zero to
infinity. And the range of P inverse is Y
552:10 - values greater than or equal to two, or the
interval from two to infinity. If you look
552:11 - closely at these domains and ranges, you'll
notice that the domain of P corresponds exactly
552:12 - to the range of P inverse, and the range of
P corresponds to the domain of P inverse.
552:13 - This makes sense because inverse functions
reverse the roles of y and x. The domain of
552:14 - f inverse of x is the x values for F inverse,
which corresponds to the y values or the range
552:15 - of F. The range of f inverse is the y values
for F inverse, which correspond to the x values
552:16 - or the domain of f. In this video, we discussed
552:17 - five key properties of inverse functions.
inverse functions reverse the roles of y and
552:18 - x. The graph of y equals f inverse of x is
the graph of y equals f of x reflected over
552:19 - the line y equals x. When we compose F with
F inverse, we get the identity function y
552:20 - equals x. And similarly, when we compose f
inverse with F, that brings x to x. In other
552:21 - words, F and F inverse undo each other. The
function f of x has an inverse function if
552:22 - and only if the graph of y equals f of x satisfies
the horizontal line test. And finally, the
552:23 - domain of f is the range of f inverse. And
the range of f is the domain of f inverse.
552:24 - These properties of inverse functions will
be important when we study exponential functions
552:25 - and their inverses logarithmic functions.
This video defines the standard inverse trig
552:26 - functions, sine inverse cosine inverse and
tan inverse. In this crazy looking graph,
552:27 - please focus first on the thin black line.
This is a graph of y equals sine x. The graph
552:28 - of the inverse of a function can be found
by flipping the graph of the original function
552:29 - over the line y equals x. I've drawn the flipped
graph with this blue dotted line. But you'll
552:30 - notice that the blue dotted line is not the
graph of a function, because it violates the
552:31 - vertical line test. So in order to get a function,
that's the inverse of y equals sine x, we
552:32 - need to restrict the domain of sine of x,
we'll restrict it to this piece that's drawn
552:33 - with a thick black line. If I invert that
piece, by flipping it over the line y equals
552:34 - x, I get the piece drawn with a red dotted
line here. And that piece does satisfy the
552:35 - vertical line test. So it is in fact a function.
of the regular sine x has domain from negative
552:36 - infinity to infinity, or restricted sine x
has domain from negative pi over two to pi
552:37 - over two. It's it's range is still from negative
one to one, just like the regular sine x.
552:38 - Because I've taken the biggest possible piece
of the graph whose flipped version is still
552:39 - a function. The inverse sine function is often
written as arc sine of x. And since inverting
552:40 - a function reverses the roles of y at x, it
reverses the domain and the range. So arc
552:41 - sine of x, the inverse function has domain
from negative one to one, and range from negative
552:42 - pi over two to pi over two, which seems plausible
from the graph. Now an inverse function undoes
552:43 - the work of a function. So if the function
sine takes angle theta, two numbers, x, then
552:44 - the inverse sine, or arc sine takes numbers
x, two angles theta. For example, since sine
552:45 - of pi over two is one, arc sine of one is
pi over two. And in general, the output of
552:46 - arc sine of x is the angle between negative
pi over two and pi over two whose side is
552:47 - x. y is equal to arc sine x means that x is
equal to sine of y. But since there are many
552:48 - angles, y who sine is x, right, they all differ
by multiples of two pi. We specify also, that
552:49 - y is between negative pi over two and pi over
two. That was the whole point of doing this
552:50 - domain restriction in order to get a well
defined inverse value. There's an alternate
552:51 - notation for inverse sine. Sometimes it's
written as sine to the negative one of x.
552:52 - But this notation can be confusing, so be
careful. In particular, sine to the negative
552:53 - one of x does not equal one over sine of x.
552:54 - One over sine of x the reciprocal function
is another word for cosecant The backs, but
552:55 - sign to the negative one of x is another word
for arc sine of x, the inverse sine function,
552:56 - which is not the same thing as the reciprocal
function. Let's go through the same process
552:57 - to build an inverse cosine function, we start
with a graph of cosine of x, we flip it over
552:58 - the line y equals x to get the blue dotted
line. But the blue dotted line is not a function.
552:59 - So we go back and restrict the domain for
our original cosine of x to just be between
553:00 - zero and pi. The resulting red graph now satisfies
the vertical line test. So it's a proper inverse
553:01 - function. Our restricted cosine has domain
from zero to pi, and range from negative one
553:02 - to one. And so our inverse function, arc cosine
has domain from negative one to one, and range
553:03 - from zero to pi. Since cosine takes us from
angles to numbers, arc cosine takes us from
553:04 - numbers back to angles. For example, cosine
of pi over four is the square root of two
553:05 - over two. So arc cosine of the square root
of two over two is equal to pi over four.
553:06 - arc cosine of x is the angle between zero
and pi, whose cosine is x. In other words,
553:07 - y equals r cosine of x means that x is equal
to cosine of y, and y is between zero and
553:08 - pi. Since otherwise, there'd be lots of possible
answers for an angle y whose cosine is x.
553:09 - The alternative notation for arc cosine is
cosine inverse. And again, we have to be careful.
553:10 - cosine to the negative 1x is not the same
thing as one over cosine of x. one over cosine
553:11 - of x is also called secant of x. cosine to
the negative 1x means arc cosine, the inverse
553:12 - function, and these two things are not the
same. Finally, let's look take a look at inverse
553:13 - tangent function. Here's a graph of tangent
and black, these vertical lines aren't really
553:14 - part of the function, they're just vertical
asymptotes. So in order to get actual function,
553:15 - when we flip over the line y equals x, we
take just one piece of the tangent function.
553:16 - Here we've taken the piece marked in black,
we flip that over the line y equals x, we
553:17 - get this piece in red, which is actually a
function because it satisfies the vertical
553:18 - line test. Now, you might ask, would it be
possible to pick a different piece of the
553:19 - tangent function to invert? And the answer
is yes, we could do that. And on another planet,
553:20 - maybe mathematicians do that. But on our planet,
we use the convention that we pick this piece
553:21 - of tangent to invert, which is kind of a convenient
choice since it's centered here around the
553:22 - origin. In the previous two examples, our
choice of restricted domain for sine and for
553:23 - cosine was also a convention that led to a
conveniently defined inverse function. In
553:24 - any case, based on our choice, our restricted
tan function has domain from negative pi over
553:25 - two to pi over two. We don't include the endpoints
in that interval, because our restricted tan
553:26 - function has vertical asymptotes, that negative
pi over two pi over two, so it's not defined
553:27 - there. The range of our restricted tan function
is from negative infinity to infinity. Therefore,
553:28 - arc tan of X has domain from negative infinity
to infinity and range from negative pi over
553:29 - two to pi over two. Once again, tangent is
taking us from angles to numbers. So arc tan
553:30 - is taking us from numbers to angles. For example,
tangent of pi over four is one, and therefore,
553:31 - arc tan of one is pi over four. So arc tan
of x means the angle between negative pi over
553:32 - two and pi over two whose tangent is x.
553:33 - y is equal to arc tan x means that x is equal
to tangent of y and the Why is between negative
553:34 - pi over two and pi over two. The inverse tan
function can also be written as 10 to the
553:35 - minus one of x. And once again, tan inverse
of x means the inverse trig function, arc
553:36 - tan of x. And it's not equal to one over tan
of x, which is called cotangent of x. And
553:37 - that's all for this video on the three basic
inverse trig functions. sine inverse x, also
553:38 - known as arc sine of x, cosine inverse x,
also known as arc cosine x, and tan inverse
553:39 - x, also known as arc tan x. In this video,
we'll use implicit differentiation to find
553:40 - the derivatives of the inverse trig functions.
First, the inverse sine function. Recall that
553:41 - y equals sine inverse of x means that y is
the angle in radians whose sine is x. In other
553:42 - words, we can write x equals sine of y as
an almost equivalent statements, I say almost
553:43 - equivalent, because there are lots of different
y's whose side is x, lots of different angles
553:44 - can have the same resulting side. And for
the inverse sine function, we specify that
553:45 - that angle y has to be between pi over two
and negative pi over two, that's just the
553:46 - convention. Be careful not to mistake sine
inverse of x, which is an inverse function,
553:47 - and one over sine x, which is a reciprocal
function. These are not the same thing. This
553:48 - negative one does not mean reciprocal here,
it means inverse function. There is another
553:49 - notation for inverse sine, which is arc sine.
So arc sine of x is the same thing as sine
553:50 - inverse of x, we want to find the derivative
of sine inverse of x, in other words, the
553:51 - derivative of y with respect to x, where y
is sine inverse of x, I'm going to rewrite
553:52 - this equation here as x equals sine y, and
then use implicit differentiation. So taking
553:53 - the derivative of both sides with respect
to x, I have derivative of x is equal to the
553:54 - derivative of sine y. In other words, one
is equal to cosine of y times dy dx. Solving
553:55 - for dydx, I have that dydx is one over cosine
of y. Now I found the derivative, but it's
553:56 - not in a super useful form, because there's
still a Y and expression, I'd rather have
553:57 - it all in terms of x. Well, I could rewrite
this as dy dx is one over cosine of sine inverse
553:58 - of x, since after all, y is equal to sine
inverse of x, but that's still not a super
553:59 - useful form, because it's difficult to evaluate
this. So instead of doing this, I'm going
554:00 - to look at a right triangle. I want to label
my triangle with y and x. Since y is my angle,
554:01 - I'll put it here. And since sine of y is x,
and sine is opposite over hypotenuse, I can
554:02 - label my opposite side with x and my hypothesis
with one. From this, I can figure out the
554:03 - length of my remaining side, it's going to
have to be the square root of one minus x
554:04 - squared by the Pythagorean Theorem. Now I
can compute cosine of y just from the triangle.
554:05 - Cosine of y is adjacent overhype hotness,
so that's the square root of one minus x squared
554:06 - over one, or just the square root of one minus
x squared. I've been implicitly assuming that
554:07 - y is a positive angle between zero and pi
over two when I've been drawing this triangle,
554:08 - but you can check that the same formula also
works. If y is a negative angle, think of
554:09 - it going down here on the unit circle instead
of up here.
554:10 - So now that I have a formula for cosine y
in terms of x, I can go back to my derivative
554:11 - and substitute and I get dy dx is one over
the square root of one minus x squared. In
554:12 - other words, I found a formula for With the
derivative of inverse sine of x, we can carry
554:13 - out a similar process to find the derivative
of inverse cosine y equals cosine inverse
554:14 - x means that x is equal to cosine of y. And
by convention, y lies between zero and pi.
554:15 - To find the derivative of arc cosine of x,
arc cosine is just an alternative notation
554:16 - for cosine inverse, I can write y equals arc
cosine of x, and equivalently x equals the
554:17 - cosine of y. And then I want to find dydx.
Using implicit differentiation, please pause
554:18 - the video and try it for yourself before going
on. So starting with the equation x equals
554:19 - cosine y, we're going to take the derivative
of both sides with respect to x. The derivative
554:20 - of x is one, and the derivative of cosine
y is negative sine y, dy dx. So d y dx is
554:21 - equal to negative one over sine y. As before,
I can draw and label a right triangle, the
554:22 - angle is y. And now I know that x is cosine
of y. So I'm going to put x on the adjacent
554:23 - side and one on my partner's leaving the square
root of one minus x squared on the opposite
554:24 - side, which means that sine of y, which is
opposite overhype hotness, is equal to the
554:25 - square root of one minus x squared. And so
dy dx is going to be negative one over the
554:26 - square root of one minus x squared. And I
have my formula for the derivative of arc
554:27 - cosine of x. inverse tangent can be handled
very similarly. And again, you may want to
554:28 - try it for yourself before watching the video.
Y equals inverse tangent of x means that x
554:29 - is tangent of y. And the convention is that
y is supposed to lie between negative pi over
554:30 - two and pi over two. Proceeding as before,
we write y equals our tan of x and x equals
554:31 - tan of y, take the derivative of both sides.
So we get one equals secant squared of y d
554:32 - y dx. Solving for dydx we have one over seacon
square root of y. And using our right triangle
554:33 - as before, we can label the angle of as y.
Since I know that tangent y is x, and tangent
554:34 - is opposite over adjacent, I'm going to label
the opposite side x and the adjacent side
554:35 - one, which gives us a hypothesis of the square
root of one plus x squared. Now we know that
554:36 - secant of y is one over cosine of y. So that's
going to be hi partners over adjacent. So
554:37 - that's the square root of one plus x squared
over one. And so secant squared of y is just
554:38 - the square of this, which is one plus x squared.
Now I can substitute into my formula for dy
554:39 - dx, and I get dy dx is one over one plus x
squared, which gives me a nice formula for
554:40 - the derivative of inverse tangent. The other
inverse trig functions cotesia inverse, seacon
554:41 - inverse and cosequin inverse, have derivatives
that can be computed. Similarly, the following
554:42 - table summarizes these results. In some books,
you may see absolute value signs around the
554:43 - X for the formulas for inverse secant and
inverse cosecant. Of course, when x is positive,
554:44 - this makes no difference. And when x is negative,
this discrepancy comes from differences in
554:45 - the convention for the range of y for these
inverse trig functions seeking inverse and
554:46 - cosecant numbers.
554:47 - Notice that the derivatives of the inverse
trig functions that start with CO, all have
554:48 - negative signs in front of them and are the
negatives of the corresponding inverse trig
554:49 - functions without the CO that makes it easier
to remember them. You should memorize these
554:50 - formulas. Let's do one example using the formulas
that we just found. Let's compute The derivative
554:51 - of tan inverse of A plus x over a minus x,
we'll want to use the formula for the derivative
554:52 - of tan inverse x. Now, to compute dydx, for
our function, we can use the chain rule, the
554:53 - outside function is tan inverse, whose derivative
is one over one plus the inside function squared,
554:54 - we'll need to multiply that by the derivative
of the inside function. I'll just copy over
554:55 - the first part and take the derivative of
a plus x over a minus x using the quotient
554:56 - rule. So I put the denominator on the bottom
and square it. And then I take low times d,
554:57 - hi, the derivative of a plus x with respect
to x is just one minus high D low, the derivative
554:58 - of a minus x with respect to x is negative
one. I'll simplify my numerator, a minus x,
554:59 - the negative one and the negative sign here
cancel, so I get plus a plus x. On the denominator,
555:00 - I have one plus a plus x squared over a minus
x squared, multiplied by a minus x squared.
555:01 - canceling in the numerator, I get to a and
distributing and the denominator I get a minus
555:02 - x squared plus a plus x squared. If I expand
out the denominator, the same simplifies to
555:03 - two a over two A squared plus 2x squared,
or just a over a squared plus x squared, which
555:04 - is a pretty nice derivative. So now you know
the derivatives of the inverse trig functions.
555:05 - And you also know how to find them using implicit
differentiation, if you ever forget them.
555:06 - When two or more quantities are related by
an equation, then their rates of change over
555:07 - time are also related. That's the idea behind
related rates. And this video gives an example
555:08 - of related rates involving distances. A tornado
is 20 miles west of us, heading due east towards
555:09 - Phillips Hall at a rate of 40 miles per hour.
you hop on your bike and ride due south at
555:10 - a speed of 12 miles per hour. How fast is
the distance between you and the tornado changing
555:11 - after 15 minutes. In a related rates problem,
it's always a good idea to draw a picture
555:12 - first, that can help you uncover the geometry
of the problem and see how quantities are
555:13 - related. In this problem, we have a right
triangle. Because the tornadoes traveling
555:14 - due east and the bicycles traveling due south
at right angles. Let's assign variables to
555:15 - the quantities of interest. I'll call the
distance between the tornado and Phillips
555:16 - Hall a. Although it starts at 20 miles, it
varies with time, and therefore it's a good
555:17 - idea to assign it a letter a variable. I'll
use B to refer to the distance between Philips
555:18 - Hall and the bicycle, a quantity that also
varies with time. And I'll let c stand for
555:19 - the distance between the tornado and the bicycle.
The problem asks us to find how fast this
555:20 - distance is changing. In other words, DC dt.
The next step is to write down equations that
555:21 - relate the quantities of interest. In this
problem, we know by the Pythagorean Theorem,
555:22 - that a squared plus b squared equals c squared.
We're interested in how fast the distance
555:23 - between you and the tornado is changing. That's
a rate of change. And the rate at which the
555:24 - bicycle is traveling and the tornado is moving.
These are also rates of change. In order to
555:25 - work these rates of change into the problem,
I'm going to take the derivative of both sides
555:26 - of this equation with respect to time. That's
the third step. So I'm going to take DDT of
555:27 - a squared plus b squared. And that's equal
to DDT of C squared. Notice that I'm thinking
555:28 - of a B and C as functions of T here, since
they vary over time, on the left side, I get
555:29 - to a times dA DT using the chain rule,
555:30 - plus two B DB dt. And on the right side, I
get to see DC dt. Now I can use the information
555:31 - given to me in the problem to plug in numbers
and solve for the quantity of interest DC
555:32 - DT since the tornado was moving at a rate
of 40 miles per hour The distance between
555:33 - the tornado and Philip's Hall is decreasing
at 40 miles per hour. In other words, da dt
555:34 - is negative 40. That negative sign is important
here, and comes from the fact that the distance
555:35 - is decreasing. Since the bicycle is moving
at 12 miles per hour, the distance between
555:36 - Philips Hall and the bicycle is increasing
at a rate of 12 miles per hour. So DBT is
555:37 - positive 12. The quantity is a, b and c are
constantly changing. But at the time of interest,
555:38 - t equals 15 minutes or in hours, 0.25 hours,
we can figure out what a B and C are. The
555:39 - tornado is starts 20 miles away, but it's
moving at a rate of 40 miles per hour. So
555:40 - after a quarter of an hour, it's gone 10 miles,
that means after a quarter of an hour, it's
555:41 - only 10 miles away. And so at the time of
point two, five hours, a equals 10. The bike
555:42 - is moving at 12 miles per hour. So after a
quarter of a mile, it's gone three miles.
555:43 - And so at this time, b equals three. Now using
the same equation we started with, we can
555:44 - plug in a and b and solve for C, we know that
c squared is going to be 10 squared plus three
555:45 - squared. So C is going to be the square root
of 109. Plugging in the numbers into this
555:46 - equation, we get two times 10 times negative
40 plus two times three times 12 equals two
555:47 - times the square root of 109 times DC dt.
So DC dt is going to be negative 800 plus
555:48 - 72 over two times a squared of 109, which
is approximately negative 35. In other words,
555:49 - the distance between the tornado and us is
decreasing at 35 miles per hour, the tornado
555:50 - is gaining on us quickly.
555:51 - These same steps will get you through a variety
of related rates problems. A couple of cautionary
555:52 - notes. Don't plug in numbers to send. Any
quantities that vary with time should be written
555:53 - as variables, so you can properly take the
derivative with respect to time. In addition,
555:54 - be careful to use negative numbers for negative
rates of change. That is, for quantities that
555:55 - are decreasing, we wouldn't have gotten the
right answer if we hadn't have used a negative
555:56 - 40 for the rate of change of the distance
here. In this video, we solved the related
555:57 - rates problem, and found that riding a bicycle
may not be the best way to escape a tornado.
555:58 - In this classic related rates problem, water's
flowing into a cone shaped tank, and we have
555:59 - to figure out how fast the water is rising.
Water flows into a tank at a rate of three
556:00 - cubic meters per minute, the tank is shaped
like a cone with a height of four meters,
556:01 - and a radius of five meters at the top, we're
supposed to find the rate at which the water
556:02 - level is rising in the tank. When the water
height is two meters. we've drawn our picture.
556:03 - Now let's label some quantities of interest.
It's fine to use numbers for the quantities
556:04 - that stay fixed throughout the problem. Like
the dimensions of the tank. For any quantities
556:05 - that are varying with time, I need to use
letters variables to represent those quantities.
556:06 - So the height of the water is varying throughout
the problem. I'll call that H. And it might
556:07 - be handy to also talk about the radius of
the part of the cone that's filled with water.
556:08 - I'll call that our ultimately I want to find
the rate at which the water level is rising.
556:09 - So that's DHD T. Next, I want to write down
equations that relate the quantities of interest.
556:10 - From geometry, I know that the volume of a
cone is 1/3 times the area of the base times
556:11 - the height. So the volume of water in the
cone is going to be 1/3 times pi r squared
556:12 - times h since h is the height of the piece
of the code that contains water. And pi r
556:13 - squared is the area of that circular base
for that piece of account. I'm calling it
556:14 - the base even though it's at the top. There's
one more equation that's going to be handy
556:15 - here that comes from similar triangles. From
similar triangles, we know the ratio of sides
556:16 - for the little triangle here is the same as
the ratio of sides for the big triangle. In
556:17 - other words, we know that our over h is going
to be equal to five over four. I can use this
556:18 - relationship to eliminate one of the variables
in this equation. Let's think for a minute
556:19 - which one we want to eliminate. Since we're
ultimately interested in finding DHD T, we
556:20 - need to keep the variable h in here. But since
we don't have any information about how are
556:21 - you changing, it's a good idea to get rid
of the R. So let's solve for r here. And we
556:22 - get r equals five fourths times h, and plug
that back into our volume equation. So we
556:23 - get v equals 1/3 pi times five fourths h squared
times h. Or in other words, V equals 25/48
556:24 - pi h cubed. Now we're gonna derive both sides
of the equation with respect to time t, to
556:25 - get rates of change into the problem. Remember
that we're thinking of the volume of water
556:26 - and the height of water as functions of time
t, we get dv dt equals 2548. It's pi times
556:27 - three h squared DHD t. Now let's plug in numbers
and solve for the quantity of interest DHD
556:28 - T. From our problem, we know that water's
flowing into the tank at a rate of three cubic
556:29 - meters per minute. So dv dt is three, we're
asked to find the rate at which the water
556:30 - level is rising when the water height is two
meters. So that's when h is two. Plugging
556:31 - in those values and solving for a DHD T, we
get d h dt is equal to three divided by 2540.
556:32 - It's pi times three times two squared, which
is 12 over 25 pi meters per second, are about
556:33 - point one five meters per second.
556:34 - This video solve the related rates problem
involving volume, and use the trick of finding
556:35 - similar triangles to eliminate one variable.
In this video, we'll do a related rates problem
556:36 - involving rotation and angles. a lighthouse
that's half a mile west of shore, has a rotating
556:37 - light that makes two revolutions per minute
in the counterclockwise direction, the shore
556:38 - runs north south, and there's a cave directly
east of the lighthouse. How fast is the beam
556:39 - of light moving along the shore at a point
one mile north of the cave. we've drawn a
556:40 - picture. Now let's label it with variables
for all the quantities that are changing with
556:41 - time, the distance between the lighthouse
and the cave that's fixed. So we don't have
556:42 - to put a variable for that. But the distance
between the cave and the point on the shore
556:43 - where the light is hitting, that's varying.
So I'll call that say x. Since we want to
556:44 - know how fast the beam of light is moving,
we're going to want to know how that distance
556:45 - x is changing. In other words, we want to
calculate dx dt, when x is one. The high partners
556:46 - of this right triangle made by the beam of
light is also changing with time as as the
556:47 - angle here between the beam of light and the
East West line, I'll call that angle theta.
556:48 - And the angle up here, I suppose is also changing
and call that fee. This angle is the right
556:49 - angle between the East West line and the north
south line. So that doesn't change, it's always
556:50 - 90 degrees. Next, we want to write down equations
to relate the quantities of interest. Whenever
556:51 - I see a right triangle in a problem, I'm tempted
to write down the Pythagorean theorem, which
556:52 - in this case would say one half squared plus
x squared equals h squared. But in this particular
556:53 - problem, it doesn't look like that's going
to help us much because of a tiger in theory
556:54 - and would relate x and h. But we don't have
any information about how H is changing. The
556:55 - only rate of change information given to us
is this two revolutions per minute. Two revolutions
556:56 - per minute is indirectly telling us how this
angle theta is changing. Because if the light
556:57 - beam is making two revolutions per minute,
then since they're two pi radians in a revolution,
556:58 - that amounts to a change of four pi radians
per minute for the angle theta. Therefore
556:59 - I'd really like to write down the equation
that has to do with theta and x. And from
557:00 - trig, I know that tangent of theta is opposite
over adjacent. So I can write down tangent
557:01 - theta equals x divided by one half. Or in
other words, tangent theta is 2x. This is
557:02 - the equation that I need that relates x and
theta. Now I'm going to derive both sides
557:03 - with respect to time t. And I get second squared
theta, d theta dt equals two times dx dt.
557:04 - Next, I can plug in numbers and solve for
my quantity of interest, which is dx dt when
557:05 - x equals one. We already figured out from
the two revolutions per minute, that d theta
557:06 - dt is four pi. Now secant theta is one over
cosine theta. And since cosine theta is adjacent
557:07 - ever had partners, it's reciprocal is high
partners over adjacent. So in our picture,
557:08 - that gives us h over one half. Well, when
x equals one, H, is going to be the square
557:09 - root of one squared plus a half squared by
the Pythagorean Theorem. And we'll divide
557:10 - that by one half. And simplifying, we get
the square root of five fourths divided by
557:11 - one half, which ends up as the square root
of five. So let's plug these values into our
557:12 - equation involving derivatives. And we get
the square root of five squared per second
557:13 - squared times four pi, four d theta dt
557:14 - equals two times dx dt. Solving for dx dt,
we get dx dt is five times four pi divided
557:15 - by two, or 10 pi. So what are the units here
on dx dt, since our distance has been in miles,
557:16 - and our time is in minutes, this is 10 pi
miles per minute. If I want to convert this
557:17 - to more standard units of miles per hour,
I can just multiply my 10 pi miles per minute
557:18 - by 60 minutes per hour to get 600 pi miles
per hour. That works out to about 1885 miles
557:19 - per hour, which is pretty darn fast. In this
related rates problem, we related rotations
557:20 - per minute, to a change in angle per minute.
And we use the trig equation to relate angle
557:21 - and side length. solving a right triangle
means finding the length of all the sides
557:22 - and the measures of the angles given partial
information. In this example, we're given
557:23 - the length of one side and the measure of
one angle, plus we know the measure of this
557:24 - right angle is 90 degrees, we need to find
the measure of the third angle labeled capital
557:25 - A, and the length of the two sides labeled
lowercase b and lowercase C. To find the measure
557:26 - of angle A, let's use the fact that the measures
of the three angles of a triangle add up to
557:27 - 180 degrees. So that means that 49 degrees
plus 90 degrees plus a is equal to 180 degrees.
557:28 - So A is equal to 180 degrees minus 90 degrees
minus 49 degrees, which works out to 41 degrees.
557:29 - To find the length of the side D we have a
couple of possible options. We could use the
557:30 - fact that tan of 49 degrees, which is opposite
over adjacent is B over 23. So b is 23 times
557:31 - tan 49 degrees, which works out to 26.46 units.
Alternatively, we could use the fact that
557:32 - tan of 41 degrees is 23 over b since now if
we're looking at the angle here 23 is our
557:33 - opposite and B is an adjacent That's a little
bit harder to solve algebraically. But we
557:34 - can write B tan 41 degrees equals 23, which
means that B is 23 divided by tan 41 degrees.
557:35 - With a calculator that works out again to
26.46. The reason we want to use 10 in this
557:36 - problem and not say sine or cosine is because
10 of say 49 degrees relates, and the unknown
557:37 - side that we're looking for be to the side
that we know the measure of, if we had use
557:38 - sine instead, would be saying that sine of
49 is B over C, and we'd have two unknowns,
557:39 - which would make it difficult to solve. Next,
to find the side length C, we can have a few
557:40 - options, we could use a trig function again,
for example, we could use the cosine of 49
557:41 - degrees, that's adjacent over hypotenuse,
which is 23 oversee. Solving for C, we get
557:42 - that C is 23 over cosine 49, which works out
to 35.06 units. Another option would be to
557:43 - use the Pythagorean Theorem to find C. Since
we know 23 squared plus b squared equals c
557:44 - squared. In other words, that's 23 squared
plus 26.46 squared equals c squared, which
557:45 - means that C is the square root of that song,
which works out again, to 35.06. To review,
557:46 - the ideas we used were, the sum of the angles
is equal to 180 degrees. We used facts like
557:47 - tangent of an angle being opposite over adjacent
and similar facts about sine and cosine. And
557:48 - we use the Pythagorean Theorem. This allowed
us to find all the angles and side lengths
557:49 - of the triangle, knowing just the side length
of one side and the angle of one of the non
557:50 - right angles to begin with. In this next example,
we don't know any of the angles except for
557:51 - the right angle, but we know to have the side
lengths.
557:52 - To find the unknown angle theta, we can use
the fact that cosine theta is adjacent overhype
557:53 - hotness, so that's 10 over 15. Cosine is a
good trig function to use here, because this
557:54 - equation relates our unknown angle to our
two known sides. So we just have one unknown
557:55 - in our equation to solve for. To solve for
theta, we just take the cosine inverse of
557:56 - 10/15, which is 0.8411 radians, or 48.19 degrees.
To find the measure of angle fee, we could
557:57 - use the fact that sine of fee is 10 over 15
and take sine inverse of 10/15. But probably
557:58 - a little easier, let's just use the fact that
these three angles do 180 degrees. That tells
557:59 - us that fee plus 90 plus 48.19 is equal to
180. Which means that fee is 41.81. Finally,
558:00 - we can find x either using a trig function,
or by using the Pythagorean Theorem. To find
558:01 - it using a trig function, we could write down
something like tan of 48.19 degrees is x over
558:02 - 10. To find that using the Tyrion theorem,
we'd write down 10 squared plus x squared
558:03 - equals 15 squared. I'll use a Pythagorean
theorem and find the x by doing the square
558:04 - root of 15 squared minus 10 squared. That
gives me an answer of 11.18. Notice that we
558:05 - use many of the same ideas as in the previous
problem. For example, the fact that the sum
558:06 - of the angles is 180. The Pythagorean theorem
and the trig functions like tan, sine and
558:07 - cosine, we also use the inverse trig functions
to get from an equation like this one to the
558:08 - angle. This video showed how it's possible
to find the length of all the sides of a right
558:09 - triangle, and the measures of all the angles
given partial information. For example, the
558:10 - measure of one angle and one side or from
two sides. This video gives some definitions
558:11 - and facts related to maximum and minimum values.
functions. function f of x has an absolute
558:12 - maximum at the x value of C. If f of c is
greater than or equal to f of x for all x
558:13 - in the domain of f. The point with x&y coordinates
of C FRC is called an absolute maximum point.
558:14 - And the y value f of c is called the absolute
maximum value. Now, if I draw a graph of f,
558:15 - the y value f of c is the highest value that
that function ever achieves. And an absolute
558:16 - maximum point is just a point where it achieves
that maximum value. Now, it's possible for
558:17 - a function to have more than one absolute
maximum point, if there happens to be a tie
558:18 - for the highest value. But a function has
at most one absolute maximum value. A function
558:19 - f of x has an absolute minimum that x equals
C, if f of c is less than or equal to f of
558:20 - x, for all x in the domain of f. In this case,
the point c f of c is called an absolute minimum
558:21 - point. And the y value f of c is called the
absolute minimum value. In the graph of f
558:22 - of x, f of c is now the lowest point that
the function achieves anywhere on its domain,
558:23 - and C SOC, are the coordinates of a point
where the function achieves that minimum value.
558:24 - For example, this function has an absolute
minimum value of about negative eight has
558:25 - an absolute minimum point with coordinates
three, negative eight. If this function stops
558:26 - here, and just has a domain from zero to four,
then the function has an absolute maximum
558:27 - value of 10 at the absolute maximum point
with coordinates for 10. If however, the function
558:28 - keeps going in this direction, it will not
have an absolute maximum value at all. absolute
558:29 - maximum and minimum values can also be called
global maximum and minimum values.
558:30 - In addition to absolute maximum mins, we can
talk about local maximums. So a function f
558:31 - of x has a local maximum at x equals C. If
f of c is greater than or equal to f of x,
558:32 - for all x, near C. By near C, we mean there's
some open interval around C for which this
558:33 - was true. For our graph of f, we have a local
maximum right here. Even though it's not the
558:34 - highest point anywhere around since there's
a higher point up here, this is the highest
558:35 - point in an open interval around see the point
C FFC is called a local maximum point. And
558:36 - the y value f FC is called a local maximum
value. Similarly, a function f of x has a
558:37 - local minimum at x equals C, if f of c is
less than or equal to f of x for all x, near
558:38 - C. And the point c f of c is called a local
minimum point. And the y value f of c is called
558:39 - a local minimum value. A function might have
many local minimum values. In this example,
558:40 - assuming that the domain is zero to four,
we have a local minimum point right here.
558:41 - Because it's the lowest point anywhere nearby.
It also happens to be an absolute minimum
558:42 - point. Now turning our attention to local
maximums, we have a local maximum point right
558:43 - here with coordinates about one two. Since
f of one is as high or higher than f of x
558:44 - for any x value in an open interval around
one. In this example, the absolute maximum
558:45 - point of 410 does not count as a local maximum
point. Simply because we can't take an open
558:46 - interval on both sides of for the function
doesn't exist on the right side. And so for
558:47 - that sort of technical reason, we end up with
an absolute maximum point That's not a local
558:48 - maximum point here. local maximum and minimum
values can also be called relative maximum
558:49 - and minimum values. Please take a look at
this graph and pause the video for a moment
558:50 - to mark all local maximum minimum points,
as well as all global, that is absolute maximum
558:51 - points. See if you can find the absolute maximum
value and the absolute minimum value for the
558:52 - function. I'm going to mark the local maximum
points in green, and the absolute maximum
558:53 - points in red. The function definitely has
a local men
558:54 - here. Since this is the lowest point anywhere
nearby and then open interval, and there's
558:55 - a local max point here. There's also a local
min point here, where the function also hits
558:56 - a low point and open interval. But that local
man is also an absolute man. So I'll mark
558:57 - it half green and half red. There's also a
local min point here at the point three, two,
558:58 - since this point is the as low or lower than
any point in an open interval. And the function
558:59 - is defined in an open interval around three,
even though it's discontinuous there. In fact,
559:00 - this point is tied for local minimum, with
all the points on this interval here, between
559:01 - two and three, there are as low or lower than
all points in an open interval around them.
559:02 - The point 04 doesn't count as a local max,
because the function is not defined on the
559:03 - other side of zero. So there's no open interval
to to consider. This point is also not an
559:04 - absolute maximum because the function gets
higher over here. In fact, as long as this
559:05 - trend continues, the function f of x has no
absolute maximum value at all, because its
559:06 - values just keep getting higher and higher
as x goes off to infinity. There's one more
559:07 - point that I want to consider. And that's
this point here, at three, three and a half.
559:08 - Well, it's tempting to say that f has a local
maximum here, it looks like it's the highest
559:09 - point in the ground. But in fact, there is
no point here at three 3.5. Right, the functions
559:10 - value at three is actually down here, too.
So there's no point here to be a local maximum
559:11 - point. And if you start looking at points
really close to that point, those aren't local
559:12 - maximums either, because you can always find
a point just a little bit higher as you get
559:13 - closer and closer, but don't quite reach this
missing point of three 3.5. So we have all
559:14 - the absolute and local maximum points marked.
And now to find the absolute maximum value.
559:15 - Well, we just said that there is none. But
the absolute minimum value is the y value
559:16 - of this absolute minimum point here. So I'd
say that's about 0.5. Here I've drawn the
559:17 - graph of a function. What do you notice about
the derivative of this function at its local
559:18 - maximum and minimum points, please pause the
video and think about it. Well, the local
559:19 - maximum minimum points are here, here and
here. And at two of those points, the derivative
559:20 - f prime of c equals zero. And that the third
point, f prime of c does not exist, because
559:21 - the function has a corner. A number c is called
a critical number for a function f if f prime
559:22 - of c does not exist, or f prime of c exists
and equals zero. So in other words, all of
559:23 - these local maximum minimum points for this
example, they're all critical points. And
559:24 - this is true in general, if f has a local
max or min at C, then C must be a critical
559:25 - number for F. We also say that the point c
f of c is a critical point for F. It's important
559:26 - not to read too much into this statement.
The statement says that if f has a local max
559:27 - or man at C then C must be a critical number.
But the converse doesn't hold. In other words,
559:28 - if c is a critical number, then f may or may
not have a local max or men at sea. One example
559:29 - to keep in mind is the function f of x equals
x cubed at a value of C of zero. Since f prime
559:30 - of x is 3x squared, we have that f prime of
zero equals zero. So zero is a critical number.
559:31 - But notice that F does not have a local maximum
man at x equals zero.
559:32 - In this video, we defined absolute and local,
maximum and minimums. We also defined critical
559:33 - numbers, which are numbers c, where f prime
of c equals zero, or f prime of c does not
559:34 - exist. We noted that if f has a local max
or min at C, then C is a critical number.
559:35 - But not necessarily advice. In this video,
we'll see how the first derivative and the
559:36 - second derivative can help us find local maximums
and local minimums for a function. Recall
559:37 - that f of x has a local maximum at x equals
C. If f of c is greater than or equal to f
559:38 - of x, for all x, in an open interval around
C, F of X has a local minimum at x equals
559:39 - C. If f of c is less than or equal to f of
x, for all x, in an open interval around C.
559:40 - In this example, the function f has a local
maximum at x equals six at x equals 11. And
559:41 - a local minimum at x equals about 10. We've
seen before that if f has a local max or local
559:42 - min at x equals C, then f prime of c is equal
to zero or it does not exist. Number C at
559:43 - which f prime of c is zero or does not exist,
are called critical numbers. But you have
559:44 - to be careful, because it is possible for
F to have a critical number at C. That is
559:45 - a place where if privacy is equal to zero,
or does not exist, but not have a local max,
559:46 - or min at x equals C. In fact, this happens
in the graph above, at x equals two, since
559:47 - f prime of two is zero, but there's no local
max or min there. Please pause the video for
559:48 - a moment and try to figure out what's different
about the derivative of f in the vicinity
559:49 - of x equals two, where there's no local max
or min, and in the vicinity of x equals 610
559:50 - and 11 where there are local maxes and mins.
Near the critical point at x equals two, the
559:51 - derivative is positive on the left and positive
again on the right. But near the local maximums,
559:52 - the derivative is positive on the left and
negative on the right. And near the local
559:53 - minimum, the derivative is negative on the
left and positive on the right. These observations
559:54 - help motivate the first derivative test for
finding local maximums and minimums. The first
559:55 - derivative test says that if f is a continuous
function near x equals C, and if c is a critical
559:56 - number, then we can decide if f has a local
maximum or minimum at x equals c by looking
559:57 - at the first derivative near x equals C. More
specifically, if we know that f prime of x
559:58 - is positive for x less than c, and negative
for x greater than c, then our function looks
559:59 - something like this. Or maybe like this, your
x equals C, and so we have a local max at
560:00 - x equals C. If on the other hand, f prime
of x is negative for x less than c, and positive
560:01 - for x greater than c, then our function looks
something like this. Or maybe like this, your
560:02 - x equals C and so we have local men at x equals
see. If our first derivative is positive on
560:03 - both sides of C or negative on both sides
of C, then we do not have a look All extreme
560:04 - point at all at x equals C. Instead, our graph
might look something like this, or maybe like
560:05 - this. The first derivative test is great,
because it lets us locate local extreme points
560:06 - just by looking at the first derivative. The
second derivative test gives us an alternative
560:07 - for finding local maximum points by using
the second derivative. Specifically, the second
560:08 - derivative test tells us that if f is continuous
near x equals C, then if f prime of c is equal
560:09 - to zero, and f double prime of c is greater
than zero,
560:10 - then f has a local min at x equals C. If on
the other hand, f prime of c equals zero,
560:11 - and f double prime of c is less than zero,
then f has a local max at x equals C. Note
560:12 - that if f double prime of c is equal to zero,
or does not exist, then the second derivative
560:13 - test is inconclusive. We might have a local
max or a local man at x equals C, or we might
560:14 - not. So we'd have to use a different method
like the first derivative test to find out.
560:15 - In this video, we introduced the first derivative
test and the second derivative test, which
560:16 - allow us to determine if a function has a
local minimum or a local maximum at a certain
560:17 - value of x. In this video, I'll work through
two examples of finding extreme values, that
560:18 - is, maximum values and minimum values of functions.
In the first example, we're asked to find
560:19 - the absolute maximum and minimum values for
this rational function g of x on the interval
560:20 - from zero to four, these maximum and minimum
values could occur at critical numbers in
560:21 - the interior of the interval, or they could
occur at the endpoints of the interval. So
560:22 - we'll need to check the critical numbers,
and check the endpoints and compare our values.
560:23 - To find the critical numbers, those are the
numbers where g prime of x is equal to zero
560:24 - or does not exist. So let's take the derivative
g prime of x using the quotient rule. So we
560:25 - get x squared plus x plus two squared on the
denominator, and then we have low times d
560:26 - high, the derivative of the numerator is one
minus high times the derivative of the denominator,
560:27 - that's 2x plus one. Before we figure out where
that zero or doesn't exist, let's simplify
560:28 - it a little bit. So we can multiply out the
numerator. I'll distribute the negative sign.
560:29 - And I'll add together like terms in the numerator,
I'm just leaving the denominator alone on
560:30 - all these steps. So our simplified numerator
is going to be minus x squared plus 2x plus
560:31 - three. Now that I've simplified the derivative,
I can figure out where it's equal to zero
560:32 - and where it doesn't exist. Let me clear a
little space. Now the only way that g prime
560:33 - of x could not exist, is if the denominator
is zero. But on our interval, where x is between
560:34 - zero and 4x squared plus x plus two is always
greater than or equal to two. So the denominator
560:35 - is never zero on this interval. In fact, it
turns out that x squared plus x plus two is
560:36 - never zero, even if we look outside this interval.
And you can check that if you want to use
560:37 - the quadratic formula. But in any case, we
don't have to worry about the places where
560:38 - g prime of x does not exist. So we only have
to worry where g prime of x is equal to zero.
560:39 - To find where g prime of x is equal to zero,
we just have to check where the numerator
560:40 - is equal to zero. So I'll set negative x squared
plus 2x plus three equal to zero and multiply
560:41 - both sides there by negative one and a factor
I get that x equals three or x equals minus
560:42 - one. So these are my critical numbers. But
notice that one of these critical numbers
560:43 - negative one doesn't even lie within my interval,
so I don't have to worry about it. All I have
560:44 - to worry about is x equals 3x equals three
is one place where my function g could have
560:45 - an absolute maximum or minimum. So let's figure
out G's value there by plugging in three for
560:46 - x that evaluates to to 14th, or one set So
we've checked the critical numbers. Now let's
560:47 - go ahead and check the endpoints. Those are
the point the x values of zero, and four,
560:48 - since our interval is from zero to four. Plugging
in, we get that g of zero is negative one
560:49 - half, and g of four is 320 seconds. I sometimes
like to make a table of all these candidate
560:50 - values.
560:51 - The candidate x values are 03, and four and
the corresponding g of x values we found were
560:52 - negative a half 1/7, and 320 seconds. Now
to find the absolute maximum and minimum values,
560:53 - all I have to do is figure out which one of
these y values is the biggest and which is
560:54 - the smallest. Well, clearly negative one half
is a smallest, so that's the absolute minimum
560:55 - value. And we just need to compare 1/7 and
320 seconds to see which is bigger. Now, 1/7
560:56 - is the same as 320 firsts, which is going
to be bigger than 320 seconds. So one half
560:57 - 1/7 is our absolute max value. We can confirm
this by looking at a graph of our function
560:58 - g. Remember, we're just interested in the
interval from zero to four. So we're just
560:59 - interested in this section of the graph. And
it does look like the minimum value is here
561:00 - at when x equals zero minimum value of negative
one half like we found, and the maximum value.
561:01 - Well, I'm not sure exactly where it is from
this graph, but it does look like it's somewhere
561:02 - around three. And that is a value of something
around 1/7. So the graph does confirm what
561:03 - we found as a more precise answer using calculus.
For the next example, let's find the absolute
561:04 - extreme values for the function f of x, which
is the absolute value of x minus x squared,
561:05 - on the interval from negative two to two.
As before, we can find absolute extreme values
561:06 - by checking first the critical numbers, and
then also the endpoints of the interval negative
561:07 - two and two. To find the critical numbers,
we need to take the derivative of our function.
561:08 - But because our function involves the absolute
value, it's a little tricky to take the derivative.
561:09 - Instead, let's first rewrite f using piecewise
notation. Recall that, if we're looking at
561:10 - the absolute value of x, when x is bigger
than or equal to zero, absolute value of x
561:11 - is just x. So f of x will be x minus x squared.
On the other hand, when x is less than zero,
561:12 - the absolute value of x is negative x. So
f of x will be negative x minus x squared.
561:13 - Now to take the derivative, we can take the
derivative of each piece. So when x is bigger
561:14 - than zero, I don't want to take the derivative
when x equals zero, because there might be
561:15 - funny things happening, you know, a cost per
corner, so I'm just gonna worry about when
561:16 - x is bigger than zero, and when x is less
than zero, for now, when x is bigger than
561:17 - zero, I can just use the power rule I get
one minus 2x is the derivative when x is less
561:18 - than zero, I get negative one minus 2x. And
now to find where I have critical numbers,
561:19 - I need to find where f prime of x is equal
to zero, or f prime of x does not exist. Well,
561:20 - f prime of x equals zero, where one minus
2x equals zero for x bigger than zero. And
561:21 - where one, negative one minus 2x is equal
to zero for x less than zero. So that corresponds
561:22 - to x equal one half for x bigger than zero,
and x equals negative one half for x less
561:23 - than zero. So those are my first two critical
numbers. And that is they do lie within my
561:24 - interval that I'm interested in. But I also
have to worry about where f prime of x does
561:25 - not exist. And the candidate x value for that
is where x equals 01 way to convince ourselves
561:26 - the derivative does not exist when x equals
zero is to look at the fact that the derivative
561:27 - is very close to one for x values, very close
to zero from the right side and very close
561:28 - to negative one for x values from the left
side. So the graph of the function is going
561:29 - to have to be sloping down with a slope near
negative one for x less than zero and up with
561:30 - a slope near one for x greater than zero,
and so it'll end up having a cost per corner
561:31 - there.
561:32 - Also notice that even if I weren't 100% sure
that the derivative didn't exist at x equals
561:33 - zero, it's not going to hurt to consider this
x equals zero as a possible additional candidate
561:34 - for the absolute max or min value. So I've
got my three critical numbers, and my end
561:35 - points are just going to be x equals negative
two and x equals two. So let me make a chart
561:36 - of values my x values to consider are negative
two, negative one half 01, half and positive
561:37 - two, and my corresponding f of x values are
going to be, let's say absolute value of negative
561:38 - two minus negative two squared works out to
two minus four, which is negative two, I plug
561:39 - in negative one half, I get one half minus
1/4, which is 1/4. plug in zero, I get zero.
561:40 - and plugging in one half, I get 1/4. And plugging
in two, I get negative two again. So now my
561:41 - biggest value is going to be 1/4. So that's
my absolute max value, and my smallest value
561:42 - is going to be negative two. So that's my
absolute min value, I can confirm what I found
561:43 - looking at the graph. So here I've graphed
my function, y equals absolute value of x
561:44 - minus x squared on the interval from negative
two to two. And I can see indeed, that my
561:45 - absolute min is going to be a value of negative
two, it occurs at two absolute minimum points,
561:46 - and my absolute maximum is going to be a value
of about 1/4. And that occurs at two absolute
561:47 - maximum points. And that concludes this video
on finding extreme values. the mean value
561:48 - theorem relates the average rate of change
of a function on an interval to its instantaneous
561:49 - rate of change, or derivative. Let's assume
that f is a function defined on a closed interval
561:50 - a, b, and maybe defined in some other places
to let's assume that f is continuous on the
561:51 - whole closed interval. And that is differentiable
on the interior of the interval, then the
561:52 - mean value theorem says that there must be
some number c in the interval a, b, such that
561:53 - the average rate of change of f on a B is
equal to the derivative of f at C. In symbols,
561:54 - we can write the average rate of change as
f of b minus F of A over B minus A. And that
561:55 - has to equal f prime at C for some number
C. On the graph, the average rate of change
561:56 - of f is the slope of the secant line. And
so the mean value theorem says that there's
561:57 - some number c, somewhere in between a and
b, so that the slope of the secant line is
561:58 - exactly the same as the slope of the tangent
line at that x value of C. The number c is
561:59 - not necessarily unique. So I encourage you
to pause the video and see if you can draw
562:00 - a graph of a function where there's more than
one c value that works. So you might have
562:01 - drawn something maybe like this. Now, if we
draw our secant line, there's two values of
562:02 - c, where the slope of the tangent line is
equal to the slope of the secant line. In
562:03 - this example, we're asked to verify the mean
value theorem for a particular function on
562:04 - a particular interval. Verify means that we
need to check the hypotheses of the theorem
562:05 - hold. And also the the conclusion holds. The
hypotheses are that f is continuous on the
562:06 - closed interval, one three, and that is differentiable
on that interior of that interval. Both of
562:07 - these facts are true, because f is a polynomial.
Now we need to verify that the conclusion
562:08 - of the mean value theorem holds. In other
words, we need to find a number c in the interval
562:09 - one, three, such that the derivative of f
at C is equal to the average rate of change
562:10 - of f on the interval from one to three.
562:11 - Now f prime of x is 6x squared minus eight.
So f prime at any number c is just six c squared
562:12 - minus eight. We can also compute f of three
just by plugging in and get 31 and f of one
562:13 - is negative five. Plugging in these values
into our equation, we get that six c squared
562:14 - minus eight has to equal 31 minus negative
five over To, in other words, six c squared
562:15 - minus eight had better equal 18, which means
that six c squared needs to equal 24. So C
562:16 - squared has to equal four, which means that
C has to equal plus or minus two. Since negative
562:17 - two is not in the interval from one to three,
we're left with a c value of positive two.
562:18 - So C equals two is the number we're looking
for. And at C equals to f prime is equal to
562:19 - 18, which is the average rate of change of
f on the interval. we've verified the mean
562:20 - value theorem. In this example, we're told
that f of one is seven, and that the derivative
562:21 - of f is bounded between negative three and
negative two. On the interval one six, we're
562:22 - asked to find the biggest and smallest values
that f of six could possibly be. Well, the
562:23 - mean value theorem gives us one way of relating
the derivative of the function to its values
562:24 - on the endpoints of the interval. More specifically,
the mean value theorem tells us that the average
562:25 - rate of change F of six minus f of one over
six minus one is equal to the derivative f
562:26 - prime of c, for some C, in the interval, one,
six. Since the derivative is bounded between
562:27 - negative three and negative two, we know that
the average rate of change is bounded between
562:28 - negative three and negative two. We know that
f of one is seven. And now we can solve this
562:29 - inequality for f of six. Multiply the inequality
by five and add seven. And now we can see
562:30 - that negative eight is the smallest possible
value for F six and negative three is the
562:31 - largest possible roles, there is an important
special case of the mean value theorem. If
562:32 - f is a function defined on the closed interval
a b, and f of x is continuous on that whole
562:33 - closed interval, differentiable on the interior
of the interval. And if f of a is equal to
562:34 - f
562:35 - of b,
562:36 - then there's a number c in the interval a,
b, such that f prime of c is zero. If we look
562:37 - at a graph of such a function that has equal
values at a, and at B, we can see where its
562:38 - derivative has to be zero at a maximum, or
a minimum in between A and B. To see why the
562:39 - rolls there is a special case of the mean
value theorem. Think about what the mean value
562:40 - theorem would say about this function, it
would say there is a C, such that f prime
562:41 - of c is equal to the average rate of change
of the function. But since f of b and F of
562:42 - A are the same, by our assumption, this average
rate of change is just zero. And so the mean
562:43 - value theorem, its conclusion is that there's
a C, such that f prime of c equals zero, which
562:44 - is exactly the conclusion of rules theorem.
In this video, we saw that for a function
562:45 - that's continuous on a closed interval, and
differentiable on the interior of that interval,
562:46 - the average rate of change of the function
is equal to the instantaneous rate of change
562:47 - of the function, f prime of c for some C in
the interval. This video gives two proofs
562:48 - of the mean value theorem for integrals. the
mean value theorem for integrals says that
562:49 - for continuous function f of x, defined on
interval from a to b, there's some number
562:50 - c between A and B, such that f of c is equal
to the average value of f. The first proof
562:51 - that I'm going to give uses the intermediate
value theorem. Recall that the intermediate
562:52 - value theorem says that if we have a continuous
function f defined on an interval, which I'll
562:53 - call x 1x, two, if we have some number l in
between, f of x one and f of x two, then f
562:54 - has to achieve the value l somewhere between
x one and x two. Keeping in mind the intermediate
562:55 - value theorem, let's turn our attention back
to the mean value theorem for integrals. Now,
562:56 - it's possible that our function f of x might
be constant on the interval from a to b. But
562:57 - if that's true, then our mean value theorem
for integrals holds easily, because f AV is
562:58 - just equal to that constant, which is equal
to f of c for any c between A and B. So let's
562:59 - assume that f is not constant, will it continue
continuous function on a closed interval has
563:00 - to have a minimum value and a maximum value,
which I'll call little m, and big M. Now,
563:01 - we know that F's average value on the interval
has to be between its maximum value and its
563:02 - minimum value. If you don't believe this,
consider the fact that all of F's values on
563:03 - the interval have to lie between big M and
little m. And if we integrate this inequality,
563:04 - we get little m times b minus a is less than
or equal to the integral of f is less than
563:05 - or equal to big M times b minus a. Notice
that the first and the last integrals, were
563:06 - just integrating a constant. Now if I divide
all three sides by b minus a, I can see that
563:07 - little m is less than or equal to the average
value of f is less than or equal to big M
563:08 - as I wanted. Now, I just need to apply the
intermediate value theorem with F's average
563:09 - as my number L and little m and big M as my
values of f of x one and f of x two. The intermediate
563:10 - value theorem says that F average is achieved
by f of c for some C in between my x one and
563:11 - x two. And therefore, for some C in my interval
a b. And that proves the mean value theorem
563:12 - for integrals. Now I'm going to give a second
proof for the mean value theorem for integrals.
563:13 - And this time, it's going to be as a corollary
to the regular mean value theorem for functions.
563:14 - Recall that the mean value theorem for functions,
says that if g of x is continuous on a closed
563:15 - interval,
563:16 - and differentiable on the interior of that
interval, then there's some number c in the
563:17 - interval, such that the derivative of g at
C is equal to the average rate of change of
563:18 - G, across the whole interval from a to b.
Let's keep the mean value theorem for functions
563:19 - in mind, and turn our attention back to the
mean value theorem for integrals. I'm going
563:20 - to define a function g of x to be the integral
from a to x of f of t dt, where F is the function
563:21 - given to us in the statement of the mean value
theorem for integrals. Notice that g of A
563:22 - is just the integral from a to a, which is
zero, while g of B is the integral from a
563:23 - to b of our function. Now, by the fundamental
theorem of calculus, our function g of x is
563:24 - continuous and differentiable on the interval
a, b, and g prime of x is equal to f of x.
563:25 - And by the mean value theorem for functions,
we know that g prime of c has to equal g of
563:26 - b minus g of a over b minus a, for some numbers,
C and the interval a b, if we substitute in
563:27 - the three facts above, into our equation below,
we get f of c is equal to the integral from
563:28 - a to b of f of t dt minus zero over b minus
a, which is exactly the conclusion that we
563:29 - wanted to reach. This shows that the mean
value theorem for integrals really is the
563:30 - mean value theorem for functions where our
function is an integral. And this completes
563:31 - the second proof of the main value theorem
for integrals. So now I've proved the mean
563:32 - value theorem for integrals in two different
ways. And I've used a lot of the great theorems
563:33 - of calculus along the way in this video, We'll
solve inequalities involving polynomials like
563:34 - this one, and inequalities involving rational
expressions like this one. Let's start with
563:35 - a simple example, maybe a deceptively simple
example, if you see the inequality, x squared
563:36 - is less than four, you might be very tempted
to take the square root of both sides and
563:37 - get something like x is less than two as your
answer. But in fact, that doesn't work. To
563:38 - see why it's not correct, consider the x value
of negative 10. Negative 10 satisfies the
563:39 - inequality, x is less than two, since negative
10 is less than two. But it doesn't satisfy
563:40 - the inequality x squared is less than four,
since negative 10 squared is 100, which is
563:41 - not less than four. So these two inequalities
are not the same. And it doesn't work to solve
563:42 - a quadratic inequality just to take the square
root of both sides, you might be thinking
563:43 - part of why this reasoning is wrong, as we've
ignored the negative two option, right? If
563:44 - we had the equation, x squared equals four,
then x equals two would just be one option,
563:45 - x equals negative two would be another solution.
So somehow, our solution to this inequality
563:46 - should take this into account. In fact, a
good way to solve an inequality involving
563:47 - x squares or higher power terms, is to solve
the associated equation first. But before
563:48 - we even do that, I like to pull everything
over to one side, so that my inequality has
563:49 - zero on the other side. So for our equation,
I'll subtract four from both sides to get
563:50 - x squared minus four is less than zero. Now,
I'm going to actually solve the associated
563:51 - equation, x squared minus four is equal to
zero, I can do this by factoring 2x minus
563:52 - two times x plus two is equal to zero. And
I'll set my factors equal to zero, and I get
563:53 - x equals two and x equals minus two. Now,
I'm going to plot the solutions to my equation
563:54 - on the number line. So I write down negative
two and two, those are the places where my
563:55 - expression x squared minus four is equal to
zero.
563:56 - Since I want to find where x squared minus
four is less than zero, I want to know whether
563:57 - this expression x squared minus four is positive
or negative, a good way to find that out is
563:58 - to plug in test values. So first, I plug in
a test value in this area, the number line,
563:59 - something less than negative two, say x equals
negative three. If I plug in negative three
564:00 - into x squared minus four, I get negative
three squared minus four, which is nine minus
564:01 - four, which is five, that's a positive number.
So at negative three, the expression, x squared
564:02 - minus four is positive. And in fact, everywhere
on this region of the number line, my expression
564:03 - is going to be positive, because it can jump
from positive to negative, without going through
564:04 - a place where it's zero, I can figure out
whether x squared minus four is positive or
564:05 - negative on this region, and on this region
of the number line by plugging in test value
564:06 - similar way, evaluate the plug in between
negative two and two, a nice value is x equals
564:07 - 00 squared minus four, that's negative four
and negative number. So I know that my expression
564:08 - x squared minus four is negative on this whole
interval. Finally, I can plug in something
564:09 - like x equals 10, something bigger than two,
and I get 10 squared minus four. Without even
564:10 - computing that I can tell that that's going
to be a positive number. And that's all that's
564:11 - important. Again, since I want x squared minus
four to be less than zero, I'm looking for
564:12 - the places on this number line where I'm getting
negatives. So I will share that in on my number
564:13 - line. It's in here, not including the endpoints,
because the endpoints are where my expression
564:14 - x squared minus four is equal to zero and
I want it strictly less than zero, I can write
564:15 - my answer. As an inequality, negative two
is less than x is less than two, or an interval
564:16 - notation as soft bracket negative two, two
soft bracket. Our next example, we can solve
564:17 - similarly, first, we'll move everything to
one side so that our inequality is x cubed
564:18 - minus 5x squared minus 6x is greater than
or equal to zero. Next, we'll solve the associated
564:19 - equation by factoring. So first, I'll write
down the equation. Now I'll factor out an
564:20 - x. And now I'll factor the quadratic. So the
solutions to my equation are x equals 0x equals
564:21 - six and x e equals negative one, I'll write
the solutions to the equation on the number
564:22 - line. So that's negative one, zero, and six.
That's where my expression x times x minus
564:23 - six times x plus one is equal to zero. But
I want to find where it's greater than or
564:24 - equal to zero. So again, I can use test values,
I can plug in, for example, x equals negative
564:25 - two, either to this version of expression,
or to this factored version. Since I only
564:26 - care whether my answer is positive or negative,
it's sometimes easier to use the factored
564:27 - version. For example, when x is negative two,
this factor is negative. But this factor,
564:28 - x minus six is also negative when I plug in
negative two for x. Finally, x plus one, when
564:29 - I plug in negative two for x, that's negative
one, that's also negative. And a negative
564:30 - times a negative times a negative gives me
a negative number. If I plug in something
564:31 - between negative one and zero, say x equals
negative one half, then I'm going to get a
564:32 - negative for this factor, a negative for this
factor, but a positive for this third factor.
564:33 - Negative times negative times positive gives
me a positive for a test value between zero
564:34 - and six, let's try x equals one. Now I'll
get a positive for this factor a negative
564:35 - for this factor, and a positive for this factor.
positive times a negative times a positive
564:36 - gives me a negative. Finally, for a test value
bigger than six, we could use a x equals 100,
564:37 - that's going to give me positive positive
positive. So my product will be positive.
564:38 - Since I want values where my expression is
greater than or equal to zero, I want the
564:39 - places where n equals zero. And the places
where it's positive. So my final answer will
564:40 - be close bracket negative one to zero, close
bracket union, close bracket six to infinity.
564:41 - As our final example, let's consider the rational
inequality, x squared plus 6x plus nine divided
564:42 - by x minus one is less than or equal to zero.
Although it might be tempting to clear the
564:43 - denominator and multiply both sides by x minus
one, it's dangerous to do that, because x
564:44 - minus one could be a positive number. But
it could also be a negative number. And when
564:45 - you multiply both sides by a negative number,
you have to reverse the inequality. Although
564:46 - it's possible to solve the inequality this
way, by thinking of cases where x minus one
564:47 - is less than zero or bigger than zero, I think
it's much easier just to solve the same way
564:48 - as we did before. So we'll start by rewriting
so that we move all terms to the left and
564:49 - have zero on the right, well, that's already
true. So the next step would be to solve the
564:50 - associated equation. That is x squared plus
6x plus nine over x minus one is equal to
564:51 - zero. That would be where the numerators 0x
squared plus 6x plus nine is equal to zero,
564:52 - so we're x plus three squared is zero, or
x equals negative three, there's one extra
564:53 - step we have to do for rational expressions.
And that's we need to find where the expression
564:54 - does not exist. That is, let's find where
the denominator is zero. And that said, x
564:55 - equals one. I'll put all those numbers on
the number line, the places where my rational
564:56 - expression is equal to zero, and the place
where my rational expression doesn't exist,
564:57 - then I can start in with test values. For
example, x equals minus four, zero and two
564:58 - work. If I plug those values into this expression
here, I get a negative answer, a negative
564:59 - answer and a positive answer. The reason I
need to conclude the values on my number line
565:00 - where my denominator is zero is because I
can my expression can switch from negative
565:01 - to positive by passing through a place where
my rational expression doesn't exist, as well
565:02 - as passing by passing flew to a place where
my rational expression is equal to zero. Now
565:03 - I'm looking for where my original expression
was less than or equal to zero. So that means
565:04 - I want the places on the number line where
my expression is equal to zero, and also the
565:05 - places where it's negative. So My final answer
is x is less than one, or an interval notation,
565:06 - negative infinity to one. In this video, we
solved polynomial and rational inequalities
565:07 - by making a number line. And using test values
to make a sign chart. The first and second
565:08 - derivative of a function can tell us a lot
about the shape of the graph of the function.
565:09 - In this video, we'll see what f prime and
f double prime can tell us about where the
565:10 - function is increasing and decreasing, is
concave up and concave down and has inflection
565:11 - points. We say that a function is increasing.
If f of x one is less than f of x two, whenever
565:12 - x one is less than x two. In other words,
the graph of the function goes up. As x increases
565:13 - from left to right, we say the function f
is decreasing. If f of x one is greater than
565:14 - f of f two, whenever x one is less than x
two. In other words, the height of the function
565:15 - goes down as we move from left to right. In
this graph, it's a little hard to say what's
565:16 - happening when x is near two, is it completely
horizontal, or is the graph slightly increasing?
565:17 - If we assume it's slightly increasing, then,
in this example, f of x is increasing as x
565:18 - ranges from zero to six, and again as x ranges
from 10 to 11. The graph is decreasing for
565:19 - x values between six and 10. And for x values
between 11 and 12, the first derivative of
565:20 - f can tell us where the function is increasing
and decreasing. In particular, if f prime
565:21 - of x is greater than zero for all x on an
interval, then f is increasing on this interval.
565:22 - This makes sense, because f prime being greater
than zero means the tangent line has positive
565:23 - slope. Similarly, if f prime of x is less
than zero for all excellent interval, then
565:24 - f is decreasing on this interval. That's because
a negative derivative means the tangent line
565:25 - has a negative slope.
565:26 - A precise proof of these facts can be found
in the textbook, or in another video, we say
565:27 - that a function is concave up on an interval
from a to b. If informally, it looks like
565:28 - a bowl that could hold water on that interval.
More formally, the function is concave up
565:29 - on that interval. If all the tangent lines
for the function on that interval, lie below
565:30 - the graph of the function. The function is
concave down on the interval from a to b.
565:31 - If informally, it looks like an upside down
ball that would spill water on that interval.
565:32 - Or more formally, the function is concave
down. If all the tangent lines lie above the
565:33 - graph of the function on an interval. In this
example, f is concave up around here. And
565:34 - again around here. On the left piece, it looks
like part of a ball that could hold water.
565:35 - So we can say that f is concave up on the
intervals from two to four, and the interval
565:36 - from eight to 11. f is concave down on this
piece, and this piece and this piece, so we
565:37 - can say that f is concave down on the interval
from zero to two, from four to eight, and
565:38 - from 11 to 12. The concavity of a function
is related to its second derivative. Here,
565:39 - where the function is concave up, its derivative
is going from essentially zero to larger positive
565:40 - values. So the first road was increasing,
which means the second derivative is positive.
565:41 - On this section of the graph, which is also
concave up, the driven is going from negative
565:42 - values to zero. That's an increase in the
first derivative. So that means the second
565:43 - derivative here must be positive. And in this
piece, where the first term is going from
565:44 - zero to positive values, the first derivative
is also increasing, so the second derivative
565:45 - is also positive. On the parts of the function
that are concave down, we can see that in
565:46 - this example, the second derivative is negative.
Here, the first derivative is going from positive
565:47 - towards zero, that's a decrease in the first
derivative or a negative second derivative.
565:48 - Here the first derivative is going from positive
to zero to negative, that's also a decreasing
565:49 - first derivative or a negative second derivative.
And the same thing happens on this section
565:50 - here. In general, we can use the second derivative
to predict the concavity of a function. The
565:51 - concavity test says that if the second derivative
is positive for all x on an interval, then
565:52 - the function f is concave up on that interval.
Similarly, if the second derivative is negative
565:53 - for all x on the interval, then the function
f is concave down on that interval. One way
565:54 - to remember the concavity test is that a positive
second derivative gives us a happy face. So
565:55 - the smile is supposed to be a concave up function.
And a negative second derivative gives us
565:56 - a sad face where the smile or the frown, I
guess, is a concave down function. Next, let's
565:57 - talk about inflection points. A function has
an inflection point at x equals C, if it's
565:58 - continuous at C, and it changes concavity
at C. In other words, f has an inflection
565:59 - point at x equals C. If f changes from concave
up to concave down at x equals C, or it changes
566:00 - from concave down to concave up. In this graph,
if we draw the concavity regions again, we
566:01 - see that F has an inflection point at x equals
two, where the function changes from concave
566:02 - down to concave up at x equals four, where
the function changes from concave up to concave
566:03 - down at x equals eight, and again, at x equals
11. Since concavity, has to do with the second
566:04 - derivative being positive or negative, inflection
points happen where the second derivative
566:05 - changes sign from positive to negative, or
from negative to positive. And that's exactly
566:06 - what the inflection point test says. If f
double prime of x changes sign
566:07 - at x equals C, then f has an inflection point
at x equals C. Now in order to change from
566:08 - positive to negative or negative positive,
f double prime has to go through zero, or
566:09 - go through a point where it doesn't exist.
But you have to be careful, just because f
566:10 - double prime is zero, it doesn't exist, does
not guarantee that you necessarily have an
566:11 - inflection point, because it could be zero
and still be positive on both sides or negative
566:12 - on both sides. For example, if f of x is x
to the fourth, then f prime of x is for x
566:13 - cubed, and f double prime of x is 12x squared.
So f double prime at zero is certainly zero.
566:14 - But there is no inflection point at x equals
zero. In fact, the graph of f of x equals
566:15 - x to the fourth looks kinda like a flattened
quadratic, and so there's no change in calm
566:16 - cavity, f is concave up on both sides of x
equals zero. In this video, without the first
566:17 - derivative can tell us where the function
is increasing and decreasing, while the second
566:18 - derivative can tell us where the function
is concave up and concave down. And the second
566:19 - derivative, changing sign from positive to
negative or negative or positive can tell
566:20 - us where we have inflection points. Since
lines are much easier to work with, and more
566:21 - complicated functions, it can be extremely
useful to approximate a function near a particular
566:22 - value with its tangent line. That's the central
idea of this video. Let's start with an example.
566:23 - Suppose that F of T is the temperature in
degrees Fahrenheit at time t measured in hours,
566:24 - where t equals zero represents midnight. Suppose
that f of six is 60 degrees, and the derivative
566:25 - f prime of six is three degrees per hour.
What's your best estimate for the temperature
566:26 - at 7am and at 8am? Please pause the video
for a moment to make your estimate. The temperature
566:27 - at 6am is 60 degrees. So the temperature at
7am, which we're calling F of seven is approximately
566:28 - 60 degrees. But we can do better than this.
At 6am, the temperature is rising, in fact,
566:29 - it's rising at a rate of three degrees per
hour. If this rate of change continues, then
566:30 - by 7am, the temperature will have risen three
degrees and reached 63 degrees. And by 8am,
566:31 - the temperature will have had two hours to
rise from 60 degrees by a rate at a rate of
566:32 - three degrees per hour. So f of eight should
be about 60 degrees plus the three degrees
566:33 - per hour times two hours or 66 degrees. These
estimates use all the information, we're given
566:34 - both the value of the temperature at six,
and its rate of change. Let's see what these
566:35 - estimates mean graphically, in terms of the
tangent line. I'll draw a rough graph of temperature
566:36 - over time. And I'll also draw in the tangent
line at time six. At time six, the height
566:37 - of the function and the tangent line is equal
to 60 degrees. The tangent line has slope
566:38 - three degrees per hour. So that's a rise of
a run of three, which means that seven o'clock,
566:39 - which is one hour, after six o'clock, the
tangent line has risen by three degrees. And
566:40 - at eight o'clock, the tangent line has risen
by another three degrees. So at seven o'clock,
566:41 - our tangent line has had 63 degrees, and at
eight o'clock, our tangent line has height
566:42 - 66 degrees. When making these estimates, here,
we were actually using the tangent line to
566:43 - approximate our function. Our actual temperature
function may be rising more steeply than the
566:44 - tangent line, or it possibly could be rising
less steeply, like in this picture. But either
566:45 - way, the tangent line is a good approximation
for our function. When time is near six o'clock.
566:46 - The idea of approximating a function with
its tangent line is a very important idea
566:47 - that works for any differentiable function.
Let f of x be any differentiable function
566:48 - and let A be an arbitrary x value. Let's suppose
we know the value of f at a, we'll call it
566:49 - F of A. And let's say we want to find the
value of f, add an x value near a, let's call
566:50 - it a plus delta x where delta x means a small
number. If we can't compute f of a plus delta
566:51 - x directly, we can try to approximate it using
the tangent line.
566:52 - We know that the tangent line has a slope
given by f prime of a. And so when we go over
566:53 - by a run of delta x, the tangent line goes
up by a rise of f prime of A times delta x.
566:54 - So the height of the tangent line is going
to be f of a plus f prime of A times delta
566:55 - x. The linear approximation principle says
that we can approximate our function with
566:56 - our tangent line. In other words, f of a plus
delta x is approximately equal to f of a plus
566:57 - f prime of a delta x. Remember that delta
x is supposed to be a small number, because
566:58 - if you get too far away from a, your tangent
lines no longer going to be a good approximation
566:59 - of your function. But how small is small enough
is sort of a judgment call. Sometimes the
567:00 - approximation principle is written with different
symbols, if we let x equal a plus delta x,
567:01 - so x is a number close to a, then delta x
is x minus a. And we can rewrite the approximation
567:02 - principle, as f of x is approximately f of
a plus f prime of A times x minus a. The quantity
567:03 - on the right side here is sometimes referred
to as l of x, and called the linearization
567:04 - of f at A. That is the linearization of f
of a is l of x, which is equal to f of a plus
567:05 - f prime of A times x minus a. So the approximation
principle can also be written as f of x is
567:06 - approximately equal to l of x. Let's look
a little more closely at this linearization
567:07 - equation and what it has to do with the tangent
line. Suppose we were going to try to write
567:08 - down the equation of the tangent line at x
equals a, well, the equation for any line
567:09 - can be given in point slope form as y minus
y naught equals the slope times x minus x
567:10 - naught. Since we're looking for the tangent
line that goes through the point A f of a,
567:11 - we can set x naught equal to a and y naught
equal to f of a. Also, the slope of the tangent
567:12 - line is just f prime of a. So we can rewrite
this as y minus F of A equals f prime of A
567:13 - times x minus a solving for y, we get y equals
f of a plus f prime of A times x minus a.
567:14 - So this equation for the tangent line is really
just the equation that we have for the linearization.
567:15 - But linearization is really just a fancy word
for the tangent line. There's a lot of notation
567:16 - and definitions on this page. But there's
only one important principle that you need
567:17 - to remember. And that's the idea that you
can approximate a function with its tangent
567:18 - line. If you can keep that idea and this picture
in mind, then it's easy to come up with this
567:19 - approximation principle. And its alternative
forms. Let's use the approximation principle
567:20 - in an example, the approximation principle
tells us that f of a plus delta x is approximately
567:21 - equal to f of a plus f prime of A times delta
x, we need to figure out what f should be
567:22 - what a should be, and what delta x should
be. Since we're trying to figure out the square
567:23 - root of 59, it makes sense to make our function
the square root function. For a, we'd like
567:24 - to pick something that is easy to compute
f of a, well, what's the number close to 59,
567:25 - that is easy to compute the square root of
64 springs to mind. So let's set a equal to
567:26 - 64. Since we're trying to compute the square
root of 59, we want a plus delta x to be 59.
567:27 - In other words, 64 plus delta x is 59. And
so delta x should be negative five, it's fine
567:28 - to have a negative number for delta x. Now
plugging into our approximation formula, we
567:29 - have f of 59 is approximately equal to f of
64, plus f prime of 64 times negative five.
567:30 - Since f of x is the square root of x, or in
other words, x to the one half power, f prime
567:31 - of x is going to be one half x to the minus
one half power, or one over two times the
567:32 - square root of x. So f prime of 64 is one
over two times the square root of 64, which
567:33 - is 1/16. I can rewrite my red equation to
say the square root of 59 is approximately
567:34 - the square root of 64 plus 1/16 times negative
five, which is eight minus five sixteenths,
567:35 - or 7.6875. using a calculator, I can get a
more exact value of the square to 59. my calculator
567:36 - says 7.68114575, up to eight decimal places.
Let me draw the picture that goes along with
567:37 - this approximation. We have the square root
function, and at x equals 64, we're looking
567:38 - at the tangent line. Our delta x here is a
negative five, and gets us down to 59. So
567:39 - we're using the value of our tangent line
right here to approximate our actual square
567:40 - root function right here. As you can see from
the picture, it looks like the tangent line
567:41 - value should be slightly bigger than the actual
value. And in fact, that's what we get. Then
567:42 - next example is very similar. We call it the
linearization of a function is just the equation
567:43 - for its tangent line. Namely, the linearization
at a is f of a plus f prime of A times x minus
567:44 - a. And the approximation principle says that
f of x, the function is approximately equal
567:45 - to its linearization. Its tangent line, at
least when x is near a. This is basically
567:46 - the same formula that we use in the last problem,
we're just calling our value x this time instead
567:47 - of a plus delta x. Since we're trying to estimate
sine of A value, it makes sense to let our
567:48 - function be sine of x. For a, we want to pick
a number that's close to 33 degrees, for which
567:49 - it's easy to calculate sine of that number.
Well, sine of 30 degrees is easy to calculate.
567:50 - So let's make a equal to 30 degrees, but let's
put it in radians and call it pi over six.
567:51 - in calculus, we pretty much always want to
use radians for sine and cosine especially
567:52 - when taking derivatives. Since the derivative
formula, D sine x dx equals cosine of x only
567:53 - works when x is in radians, our x needs to
be 33 degrees, since that's the value, we
567:54 - want to estimate the sine of, we need to multiply
by pi over 180 degrees to convert it to radians.
567:55 - So that becomes 11 pi over 60 radians. Let's
plug in for F and a first to get the linearization.
567:56 - And then we'll plug in for x next. So the
linearization of our function is going to
567:57 - be sine of pi over six, plus the derivative
of sine at pi over six times x minus pi over
567:58 - six. That is l of x is one half, since sine
of pi over six is one half, plus cosine of
567:59 - pi over six times x minus pi over six, cosine
of pi over six is the square root of three
568:00 - over two. So this is our equation for the
tangent line, or the linearization of sine
568:01 - of x at pi over six. Now we know that sine
of x is approximately equal to as linearisation,
568:02 - as long as x is near pi over six. So in particular,
sine of our 33 degrees in radians, which is
568:03 - 11 pi over 60 is approximately equal to one
half plus a square root of three over two
568:04 - times 11 pi over 60 minus pi over six.
568:05 - That simplifies to one half plus the square
root of three over two times pi over 60. And
568:06 - now I'm going to cheat a little bit and use
my calculator to get a decimal value for this
568:07 - of about 0.5453. Now if I use my calculator
to find sine of 11 pi over 60, directly, remember,
568:08 - that's the same thing as sine of 33 degrees.
my calculator tells me it is 0.5446, approximately.
568:09 - So you can see our approximation using the
linearization is very close to the calculators,
568:10 - more accurate value. Notice that in this example,
the approximate value based on the linearization
568:11 - is slightly higher than the actual value.
And you can see why from a graph of sine.
568:12 - The tangent line at pi over six lies slightly
above the graph of sine x. Therefore, the
568:13 - approximate value based on the linearization
will be slightly bigger than the actual value
568:14 - of sine of 33 degrees. In this video, we use
several formulas to express one key idea.
568:15 - The main formulas were the approximation principle,
the linear approximation, and the linearization.
568:16 - The key idea is that a differentiable function
can be approximated near a value x equals
568:17 - A by the tangent line at x equals a. The differential
is a new vocabulary word wrapped around the
568:18 - familiar concept of approximating a function
with its tangent line. This figure should
568:19 - look familiar from the previous video on linear
approximation is the same picture. Suppose
568:20 - we have a differentiable function, f of x,
and we know the value of f at some x value
568:21 - a. That is, we know the value of f evey, but
we don't know the value of f at some nearby
568:22 - x value a plus delta x. That is we don't know
f of a plus delta x. So we draw the tangent
568:23 - line to f of x at x equals a. And we use the
tangent line at a plus delta x as an approximation
568:24 - for the function at a plus delta x. Since
the tangent line has slope of f prime of a,
568:25 - the rise of a run is f prime of a. So if this
run here is delta x, this rise has to be f
568:26 - prime of A times delta x. So the height of
the tangent line here at a plus delta x is
568:27 - going to be f of a plus f prime of A times
delta x. That's just the height here plus
568:28 - the extra height here. And since we're using
that height to approximate In our function,
568:29 - we say that f of a plus delta x is approximately
equal to f of a plus f prime of A times delta
568:30 - x equivalently. If I subtract F of A from
both sides, I get f of a plus delta x minus
568:31 - f of a is approximately equal to f prime of
A times delta x. This equation is just the
568:32 - approximation principle that we've seen before.
And this is a very slight alteration of it.
568:33 - So there's nothing new yet. But now I'm going
to wrap some new notation around this familiar
568:34 - concept. The differential dx is another way
of writing delta x, you can think of it as
568:35 - a small change in the value of x. The differential
df is defined as f prime of x dx, or equivalently
568:36 - f prime of x delta x. Sometimes this is written
as d y instead, but d y just means the same
568:37 - thing here as df. Sometimes it's handy to
specify the differential add a particular
568:38 - value of x, like a value of x equals a, and
this is written df equals f prime of a dx,
568:39 - or f prime of a delta x. Notice that the value
of a is not apparent when you just write down
568:40 - d f, or d y.
568:41 - Finally, the change in f, which is written
delta f, is defined as f of x plus delta x
568:42 - minus f of x for some value of x, for example,
f of a plus delta x minus f of a, this can
568:43 - also be written as the change in y. Using
these new definitions, we can now rewrite
568:44 - our approximation principle to say, delta
f is approximately equal to d f, the change
568:45 - in the function is approximately equal to
the differential course this could also be
568:46 - written as the change in Y is approximately
equal to d y. In the picture, we can now write
568:47 - d x for the run, and D, F, for the rise of
the tangent line. Pause the video and take
568:48 - a moment to find delta f in this picture,
though delta f is f of a plus delta x minus
568:49 - f of a, so that's this height here. I'll write
that as delta f, or delta y. So the approximation
568:50 - principle, written in differential notation,
is just saying that the rise of the function,
568:51 - delta f is approximated by the rise in the
tangent line df. Let's use the differential
568:52 - and an example. For the function f of x equal
to x times ln x. Let's first find the differential
568:53 - df. We know that df is equal to f prime of
x dx. And f prime of x by the product rule
568:54 - is equal to x times the derivative of ln x,
which is one over x plus the derivative of
568:55 - x, which is one times ln x. So in other words,
one plus ln x. Therefore, df is equal to one
568:56 - plus ln x times dx. When x equals two, and
delta x equals negative point three, well
568:57 - delta x is the same thing as dx, we can just
plug in those values and get df is one plus
568:58 - ln of two times negative 0.3. as a decimal,
that's approximately negative 0.5079. Now
568:59 - delta f is defined as f of x plus delta x
minus f of x. So for our function, that's
569:00 - x plus delta x times ln of x plus delta x
minus x ln x. Plugging in the given values
569:01 - for x and delta x, we get delta f is two minus
0.3 times ln of two minus 0.3 minus two ln
569:02 - two, which according to my calculator is negative
zero. Point 4842. And we see that the change
569:03 - in the function between two and two minus
point three is closely approximated by the
569:04 - change in the tangent line. As expected. The
differential is often used to estimate error,
569:05 - as in this example, suppose that the radius
of a sphere is measured as eight centimeters
569:06 - with a possible error of point five centimeters.
So the sphere that we measure looks something
569:07 - like this, but the actual sphere might be
slightly bigger, or slightly smaller, we want
569:08 - to use the differential to estimate the resulting
error in computing the volume of the sphere.
569:09 - Well, the volume of a sphere is given by four
thirds pi r cubed, where r is the radius.
569:10 - If our radius changes by point five centimeters,
our volume will change by substantially more.
569:11 - And that change in volume is the error the
resulting error in measuring volume. But instead
569:12 - of computing delta V directly, we're asked
to approximate it using the differential.
569:13 - So we're going to use the fact that delta
V is approximately equal to dv, which is easier
569:14 - to compute.
569:15 - By definition, dv is equal to the derivative
of our function, I'll just call that v prime
569:16 - as a function of r times Dr. Now, v prime
of r is equal to four pi r squared, just by
569:17 - taking the derivative. And here, we're interested
in an R value of eight, and a value of Dr.
569:18 - Same as delta r of 0.5 centimeters. So dv
is going to be four pi r squared Dr. And when
569:19 - I plug in R and D R, I get four pi times eight
squared times 0.5, which is 128 pi, or as
569:20 - a decimal 402.1 centimeters. That's our error
estimate, which seems quite a bit bigger than
569:21 - our original error of point five in measuring
the radius. Now, the relative error of a function
569:22 - is its error over the original value of the
function. So in our case, it's the change
569:23 - in volume over the actual volume. Since we're
using the differential instead, we'll compute
569:24 - the relative error as dv over V. Now, the
volume when r is eight centimeters, is four
569:25 - thirds times pi times eight cubed. And dv,
we already saw was four pi times eight squared
569:26 - times 0.5. So dv divided by V is given by
this ratio, which simplifies to 0.1875. So
569:27 - an 18.75% relative there. To me, the relative
error gives a better sense for the error than
569:28 - the absolute error estimate above. This video
introduced the idea of the differential, we
569:29 - said that we could think of dx as just being
another way of writing delta x, but df represents
569:30 - the rise in the tangent line, and is equal
to f prime of x times dx. Whereas delta f
569:31 - is the rise in the actual function F. And
that's f of x plus delta x minus f of x. On
569:32 - the picture, dx is the run, df is the rise
in the tangent line. And delta f is the rise
569:33 - in the actual function. In the language of
differentials, we can restate the approximation
569:34 - principle to say that the change in f can
be approximated by the differential. In the
569:35 - past, we've encountered limits, like the limit
as x goes to two of x minus two over x squared
569:36 - minus four. We can't evaluate this limit just
by plugging in two for x, because x minus
569:37 - two goes to zero, and x squared minus four
goes to zero as x goes to two. This is known
569:38 - as a zero over zero indeterminate form. It's
called indeterminate because we can't tell
569:39 - what the limit is going to be just by the
fact that the numerator goes to zero and the
569:40 - denominator goes to zero. It depends on how
fast the numerator and the denominator are
569:41 - going to zero compared to each other. And
the final limit of the quotient could be any
569:42 - number at all, or it could be infinity or
it could not even exist. In the past, we've
569:43 - been able to evaluate some limits in zero
over zero indeterminate form by using algebraic
569:44 - tricks to rewrite the quotients. In this video,
we'll introduce lopi talls rule, which is
569:45 - a very powerful technique for evaluating limits
and indeterminate forms. A limited of the
569:46 - form the limit as x goes to a of f of x over
g of x is called a zero over zero indeterminate
569:47 - form, if the limit as x goes to a of f of
x is equal to zero, and the limit as x goes
569:48 - to a of g of x is equal to zero. A limit and
this form is called an infinity over infinity
569:49 - and determinant form. If the limit as x goes
to a of f of x is equal to infinity or minus
569:50 - infinity. And the limit as x goes to a of
g of x is equal to infinity or minus infinity.
569:51 - We saw an example of a zero over zero indeterminate
form in the introductory slide.
569:52 - One example of a infinity over infinity and
determinant form is the limit as x goes to
569:53 - infinity of 3x squared minus 2x plus seven
divided by negative 2x squared plus 16. Notice
569:54 - that as x goes to infinity, the numerator
goes to infinity while the denominator goes
569:55 - to negative infinity. In these definitions
of indeterminate form, it's possible for a
569:56 - to be negative infinity or infinity, like
it is in this example, but it doesn't have
569:57 - to be loopy. talls rule can be applied when
f and g are differentiable functions. And
569:58 - the derivative of g is nonzero in some open
interval around a except possibly in a under
569:59 - these conditions, if the limit as x goes to
a of f of x over g of x is zero over zero
570:00 - or infinity over infinity indeterminant form
than the limit as x goes to a of f of x over
570:01 - g of x is the same thing as the limit as x
goes to a of f prime of x over g prime of
570:02 - x, provided that the second limit exists,
or as plus or minus infinity. Let's look at
570:03 - loopy tiles rule in action. In this example,
as x goes to infinity, the numerator x goes
570:04 - to infinity and the denominator three to the
x also goes to infinity. So we have an infinity
570:05 - over infinity indeterminate form. So let's
try applying lopi tiles rule, our original
570:06 - limit should equal the limit as x goes to
infinity of the derivative of the numerator,
570:07 - which is one divided by the derivative of
the denominator, which is ln of three times
570:08 - three to the x, provided that the second limit
exists or as infinity or negative infinity.
570:09 - In the second limit, the numerators just fixed
at one. And the nominator goes to infinity
570:10 - as x goes to infinity. Therefore, the second
limit is just zero. And so the original limit
570:11 - evaluates to zero as well. In this example,
we have a zero over zero indeterminate form,
570:12 - because as x goes to zero, sine of x and x,
both go to zero in the numerator, and sine
570:13 - of x cubed goes to zero in the denominator.
So using low Patel's rule, I'll try to evaluate
570:14 - instead, the limit I get by taking the derivative
of the numerator and the derivative of the
570:15 - denominator, the derivative of sine x minus
x is cosine of x minus one, and the derivative
570:16 - of sine x cubed is three times sine x squared
times cosine x using the chain rule. Now let
570:17 - me try to evaluate the limit again, as x goes
to zero, cosine of x goes to one. So the numerator
570:18 - here goes to zero. As x goes to zero, sine
of x goes to zero and cosine of x goes to
570:19 - one, so the denominator also goes to zero.
So I still have a zero over zero indeterminate
570:20 - form. And I might as well try applying loopy
toss rule again. But before I do, I want to
570:21 - point out that cosine of x is going to one.
So the cosine of x here really isn't affecting
570:22 - my limit. And in fact, I could rewrite my
limit of a product as a product of limits
570:23 - where the second limit is just one and can
be ignored from here on out. Now apply lopatok
570:24 - rule on this first limit, which is a little
bit easier to take the derivatives and so
570:25 - the derivative of the top is minus sine x.
And the derivative of the bottom is six times
570:26 - sine x times cosine x. Now let's try to evaluate
again, as x goes to zero, our numerator is
570:27 - going to zero, and our denominator is also
going to zero. But hang on, we don't have
570:28 - to apply lobby towels rule again, because
we can actually just simplify our expression,
570:29 - the sine x on the top cancels with the sine
x on the bottom. And we can just rewrite our
570:30 - limit as the limit of negative one over six
cosine of x, which evaluates easily to negative
570:31 - one, six.
570:32 - In this example, I want to emphasize that
it's a good idea to simplify after each application
570:33 - of lopi talls rule. If you don't simplify,
like we did here, then you might be tempted
570:34 - to apply loopy towels rule and additional
time when you don't need to, which might make
570:35 - the problem more complicated. Instead of simpler
to solve this video, we were able to evaluate
570:36 - zero over zero and infinity over infinity
indeterminate forms by replacing the limit
570:37 - of f of x over g of x with the limit of f
prime of x over g prime of x, provided that
570:38 - second limit exists. This trick is known as
lopi tels rule. We've seen that lopatok rule
570:39 - can be used to evaluate limits of the form
zero over zero, or infinity over infinity.
570:40 - In this video, we'll continue to use lopi
towels rule to evaluate additional indeterminate
570:41 - forms, like zero times infinity, infinity
to the 00 to the zero, and one to the infinity.
570:42 - In this example, we want to evaluate the limit
of a product. Notice that as x goes to zero
570:43 - from the positive side, sine x goes to zero,
and ln x goes to negative infinity. Remember
570:44 - the graph of y equals ln x. So this is actually
a zero times infinity indeterminate form.
570:45 - Even though the second factor is going to
negative infinity, we still call it a zero
570:46 - times infinity and indeterminate form, you
can think of the Infinity here as standing
570:47 - for either positive or negative infinity.
It it's indeterminant. Because as x goes to
570:48 - zero, the sine x factor is pulling the product
towards zero, while the ln x factor is pulling
570:49 - the product towards large negative numbers.
And it's hard to predict what the limit of
570:50 - the product will actually be. But the great
thing is, I can actually rewrite this product
570:51 - to look like an infinity over infinity and
determinant form, or a zero over zero and
570:52 - determinant form. Instead of sine x times
ln x, I can rewrite the limit as ln x divided
570:53 - by one over sine x. Now as x goes to zero,
my numerator is going to negative infinity.
570:54 - And since sine x is going to zero through
positive numbers, my denominator one over
570:55 - sine x is going to positive infinity. So I
have an infinity over infinity indeterminate
570:56 - form. Now, I could instead choose to leave
the sine x in the numerator, and instead,
570:57 - put a one over ln x in the denominator. If
I do this, then as x goes to zero through
570:58 - positive numbers, sine x goes to zero. And
since ln x goes to negative infinity, one
570:59 - over ln x goes to zero. And so I have a zero
over zero indeterminate form. Sometimes it
571:00 - can be difficult to decide which of these
two ways to rewrite a product as a quotient.
571:01 - One rule of thumb is to take the version that
makes it easier to take the derivative of
571:02 - the numerator and denominator. Another trick
is just to try one of the ways and if you
571:03 - get stuck, go back and try the other. I'm
going to use the first method of rewriting
571:04 - it because I recognize that one over sine
x can be written as cosecant of x. And I know
571:05 - how to take the derivative of cosecant x.
Using low Beatles rule on this infinity over
571:06 - infinity and determinant form, I can rewrite
my limit as the limit of what I get when I
571:07 - take the derivative of the numerator, that's
whenever x divided by the derivative of the
571:08 - denominator, that's negative cosecant x cotangent
x. As always, I want to simplify my expression
571:09 - before going any further. I can rewrite my
trig functions in the denominator in terms
571:10 - of sine and cosine. cosecant x is one over
sine x cotangent x is cosine of x over sine
571:11 - of x. Now flipping and multiplying, I get
the limit as x goes to zero plus of one over
571:12 - x times sine squared of x over negative cosine
of x. In other words, the limit of negative
571:13 - sine squared x over x cosine x,
571:14 - we know that cosine of x goes to one as x
goes to zero. So I can rewrite this as the
571:15 - limit of negative sine squared x over x times
the limit of something that goes to one. So
571:16 - I once again have a zero over zero indeterminate
form. And I can apply lopatok rule yet again,
571:17 - taking the derivative of the top, I get negative
two, sine x, cosine of x. And the job of the
571:18 - bottom is just one. Now I'm in a good position
just to evaluate the limit by plugging in
571:19 - zero for x in the numerator, I get negative
two times zero times one, the denominator
571:20 - is just one, so my final limit is zero. In
this limit, we have a battle of forces. As
571:21 - x is going to infinity, one over x is going
to zero. So one plus one over x is going to
571:22 - one, but the exponent x is going to infinity,
it's hard to tell what's going to happen here.
571:23 - If we had one, to any finite number, that
would be one. But anything slightly bigger
571:24 - than one, as we raise it to a bigger and bigger
powers, we would expect to get infinity. So
571:25 - our limit has an independent permanent form,
it's hard to tell whether the answer is going
571:26 - to be one infinity, or maybe something in
between. Whenever I see an expression with
571:27 - a variable in the base, and a variable in
the exponent, I'm tempted to use logarithms.
571:28 - If we set y equal to one plus one over x to
the x, then if I take the natural log of both
571:29 - sides, I can use my log roles to rewrite that
by multiplying by x in the front. Now, if
571:30 - I wanted to take the limit as x goes to infinity
of ln y, that would be the limit of this product,
571:31 - x times ln one plus one over x. As x goes
to infinity, the first factor x goes to infinity.
571:32 - One plus one over x goes to just one and ln
one is going to zero. So we have a infinity
571:33 - times zero indeterminate form, which we can
try to rewrite as an infinity over infinity,
571:34 - or a zero over zero indeterminate form. Let's
rewrite this as the limit of ln one plus one
571:35 - over x divided by one over x. This is indeed
a zero over zero in determinant form. So we
571:36 - can use lobi tiles rule and take the derivative
of the top and the bottom, the derivative
571:37 - of the top is one over one plus one over x
times the derivative of the inside, which
571:38 - would be negative one over x squared. And
the derivative on the bottom, the derivative
571:39 - of one over x is negative one over x squared,
we can actually cancel out these two factors,
571:40 - and rewrite our limit as the limit as x goes
to infinity of one over one plus one over
571:41 - x, which is just equal to one, since one over
x is going to zero. So we found that the limit
571:42 - of ln y is equal to one, but we're really
interested in finding the limit of y, which
571:43 - we can think of as e to the ln y. Since ln
y is going to one, e to the ln y must be going
571:44 - to e to the one. In other words, E. So we
found that our original limit is equal to
571:45 - E. And in fact, you may recognize that this
limit is one of the ways of defining IE.
571:46 - In the previous example, we had a one to the
internet Today in determinant form, and we
571:47 - took logs and use log roles to write that
as an infinity times zero and determinant
571:48 - form. Well, the same thing can be done if
we have an infinity to the zero indeterminate
571:49 - form,
571:50 - or
571:51 - a zero to the zero indeterminate form. So
one to the infinity, infinity to the zero,
571:52 - and zero to the zero, are all indeterminate
forms that can be handled using lobi toss
571:53 - rule. In this video, we saw that a zero times
infinity indeterminate form could be converted
571:54 - to a zero over zero, or infinity over infinity
indeterminate form by rewriting f of x times
571:55 - g of x as f of x divided by one over g of
x, or as g of x divided by one over f of x.
571:56 - We also saw how to use lopi talls rule on
these three sorts of indeterminate forms by
571:57 - taking the ln of y, where y is our f of x
to the g of x that we want to take the limit
571:58 - of. This video is about Newton's method for
finding the zeros of a function, f of x. In
571:59 - other words, the values of x that make f of
x equal to zero. The zeros of a function can
572:00 - also be thought of as the x intercepts of
its graph. Suppose we want to find a solution
572:01 - to the equation either the x equals 4x. This
equation cannot be solved using standard algebraic
572:02 - methods. For example, taking the ln of both
sides doesn't really help because we still
572:03 - get x equals ln of 4x, which is just as hard
to solve. Instead, we can look for approximate
572:04 - solutions. Looking at the graph of y equals
e to the x and y equals 4x, we see there should
572:05 - be two solutions, one at approximately x equals
little more than two and the other around
572:06 - x equals maybe point three or point four.
Newton's method will allow us to make much
572:07 - more accurate approximations to the solution
of this equation, then we can do by just glancing
572:08 - at the graph. To use Newton's method, instead
of looking at the equation, e to the x equals
572:09 - 4x. We'll look at the equation E to the X
minus 4x equals zero. And in fact, we'll define
572:10 - the function f of x to be e to the x minus
4x. And look for zeros of that function. After
572:11 - all, finding a zero of this function is the
same as finding a solution to our original
572:12 - equation. So now we're trying to solve the
equivalent problem of finding the zero of
572:13 - the function f of x equals e to the x minus
4x. That's the function that's drawn below.
572:14 - I'm going to focus on this zero, the one near
to, and I'm just going to make an initial
572:15 - guess anything reasonably close to the actual
zero should do. So I'll just put an initial
572:16 - guess right here, and I'll call it x one.
Now x one is not actually zero of my function,
572:17 - and I'll write the point on the graph above
it as x one, f of x one. To get a better estimate
572:18 - for the zero of my function, I'm going to
make use of the tangent line to my function
572:19 - that goes through this point. So the second
step will be to find this tangent line. Since
572:20 - the tangent line is a reasonably good approximation
to the function, the point where the tangent
572:21 - line crosses the x axis should be closer to
the point where the function itself crosses
572:22 - the x axis, which is the point I'm looking
for. So the third step will be to find the
572:23 - x intercept for the tangent line. I'll call
this x intercept, x two. Now I'm just going
572:24 - to repeat this process. I'll use x two as
my next guess. I'll follow it up to the function
572:25 - where I have the point x to f of x two, and
then I'll draw a new tangent line and get
572:26 - a new intercept. I can repeat this process
as often as I need to, to get a sufficiently
572:27 - accurate approximation to my actual zero of
my function. Now that I've described the process
572:28 - graphically, let's find some equations that
go along with this picture. If I start with
572:29 - the initial guess, of x one, then the tangent
line through x one, f of x one is given by
572:30 - the x Bayesian y equals f of x one plus f
prime of x one times x minus x one.
572:31 - You might remember this equation from a section
on linearization. And it's really just comes
572:32 - from the formula y minus y one equals m x
minus x one that holds for any line, where
572:33 - m here is the derivative at x one, and y one
is f of x one. plugging into that equation,
572:34 - we have y minus f of x one equals f prime
of x one times x minus x one, which simplifies
572:35 - to y equals f of x one plus f prime of x one
times x minus x one. So that's where this
572:36 - linearization equation comes from. It's just
the equation of the tangent line. Now, if
572:37 - we want to find the x intercept of the tangent
line,
572:38 - we just said
572:39 - the tangent line equation equal to zeros,
we have zero equals f of x one plus f prime
572:40 - of x one times x minus x one, and we solve
for x. so this can subtract f of x one from
572:41 - each side, divided by f prime of x one and
solve for x. We're calling this new x intercept
572:42 - x two. So x two is x one minus f of x one
over f prime of x one. Now we have our second
572:43 - guess, x two, and we can again find the tangent
line through x two, f of x two, that tangent
572:44 - line will be given by the same sort of equation.
And if we then find the x intercept, the same
572:45 - algebraic steps, get us to the analogous equation
x three equals x two minus f of x two over
572:46 - f prime of x two. And more generally, as we
repeat this process over and over again, our
572:47 - n plus one guess is going to be given by x
n plus one equals x n minus f of x n over
572:48 - f prime of x n. That's the J equation at the
core of Newton's method. Now that we've got
572:49 - the theory down, let's grind through the problem
at hand with some numbers. Our function has
572:50 - the equation f of x equals e to the x minus
4x. So f prime of x is e to the x minus four.
572:51 - So from Newton's methods equation, we have
in general, X sub n plus one is X sub n minus
572:52 - e to the x sub n minus four times X sub n
over e to the x sub n minus four. Let's start
572:53 - with for example, x sub one equals three,
then x sub two is going to be three minus
572:54 - e cubed minus four times three over e cubed
minus four. plugging this into a calculator,
572:55 - I get x sub two equals 2.4973, and so on.
Now to cube compute x sub three, I have to
572:56 - take this whole number and plug that in to
my formula. I've written it out as just 2.49.
572:57 - But for accuracy, when I actually computed
my calculator, I'll use the entire number.
572:58 - my calculator gives me this answer for x of
three and continue in this process, I can
572:59 - get x of 4x 5x sub six. If I compute one more,
x of seven, I noticed that I have no change
573:00 - to my value in the number of digits that the
calculator spits out. So at this point, my
573:01 - Newton's methods iterations have converged.
And I have an answer that's accurate to about
573:02 - eight decimal places. I found one zero for
my function. And if I wanted to find the second
573:03 - zero, the one over here, I would just need
to start with an initial value that's close
573:04 - to this x coordinate, perhaps an initial value
of zero might be good. In this video, we developed
573:05 - an algorithm for getting increasingly accurate
approximations to the zero of a function.
573:06 - The central equation that we used was this
one which tells us how to get from one approximation,
573:07 - X sub n to the next 1x sub n plus one. When
we go from a function, say 3x plus sine x
573:08 - to its derivative, in this case, three plus
cosine x, that's called differentiating, or
573:09 - finding a derivative. Anti differentiating,
or finding an antiderivative, takes us the
573:10 - other direction, from a derivative to a function
that has that as its derivative.
573:11 - For example, if g prime of x is 3x squared,
that's the derivative. What could g of x the
573:12 - original function be? Well, g of x could be
x cubed, since the derivative of x cubed is
573:13 - 3x squared. Or it could also be g of x equals
x cubed plus seven, for example, or g of x
573:14 - equals x cubed plus any constant, where I
write a general constant with a capital C.
573:15 - That's because the derivative of a constant
zero, so the derivative of x cubed plus a
573:16 - constant is just going to be 3x squared, no
matter what the constant is. A function capital
573:17 - F of X is called an antiderivative of lowercase
F of X on an interval a, b, if the derivative,
573:18 - capital F prime of X is equal to lowercase
F of X on that interval a b. In other words,
573:19 - we can think of little f as being the derivative
of the function capital F. In the above example,
573:20 - x cubed is an antiderivative of 3x squared.
And in fact, x cubed plus C for any constant
573:21 - C is also an antiderivative of 3x squared.
When we add on a general constancy, that's
573:22 - sometimes referred to as a general antiderivative,
we found a general family of anti derivatives
573:23 - for the function 3x squared. But could there
be other anti derivatives, other functions
573:24 - whose derivative is 3x squared. In fact, there
are no others. And one way to think about
573:25 - this intuitively, is if you have two functions
with the same derivative, it's like having
573:26 - two runners in a race that always speed up
and slow down at exactly the same times. If
573:27 - one of those runners starts ahead of the other,
then the distance between them will always
573:28 - stay exactly the same. That's the vertical
distance drawn here on the graph. And that's
573:29 - the constant C, that separates one antiderivative
y equals x cubed from another y equals x cubed
573:30 - plus C. And in general, if capital F of X
is an antiderivative for a little f of x,
573:31 - then all other anti derivatives can be written
in the form capital F of x plus C for some
573:32 - constancy. A more rigorous justification of
this fact, can be proved using the mean value
573:33 - theorem, as I'll do in a separate video. If
you know the derivatives for some standard
573:34 - functions, then it's pretty easy to get some
anti derivatives. For example, the antiderivative
573:35 - of one is x. Since the derivative of x is
one, if we want to make that a general antiderivative,
573:36 - we can add a constant C, the antiderivative
of x is x squared over two because when I
573:37 - take the derivative of x squared over two,
the two that I pulled down and multiply cancels
573:38 - with the two in the denominator, leaving me
x. Again, I can make this a more general antiderivative
573:39 - by adding a constant C. More generally, the
antiderivative of x to the n for any and that's
573:40 - not equal to negative one is given by x to
the n plus one divided by n plus one plus
573:41 - a constant C. I can check this by taking the
derivative of x to the n plus one over n plus
573:42 - one. The n here is just a constant. So using
the power rule, I get n plus one times x to
573:43 - the n divided by n plus one that yields x
to the n, which is what I want it. We can
573:44 - think of this rule as the power rule for anti
differentiating since it's closely related
573:45 - to the power rule for differentiating. Now,
this rule doesn't apply when n equals negative
573:46 - one. Notice that we'd be dividing by zero
if n were negative one but we can handle the
573:47 - case when n equals negative one separately,
since x to the negative one is one of our
573:48 - x, we recognize that the antiderivative of
one of our x is just ln of the absolute value
573:49 - of x plus C. Since the derivative of ln of
the absolute value of x is one over x, please
573:50 - pause the video and see how many more anti
derivatives you can fill in in this table.
573:51 - You should get all of these formulas based
on the analogous formulas for differentiating,
573:52 - notice that the antiderivative of sine x is
negative cosine x not cosine x, because the
573:53 - derivative of cosine x is negative sine x.
If I have a constant times x to the n, I'm
573:54 - going to call the constant a instead of C,
since I've already got some C's floating around.
573:55 - If I want the antiderivative of A times x
to the n, that's just going to be a times
573:56 - the antiderivative of x to the n, which is
x to the n plus one over n plus one plus a
573:57 - constant say that's because when I take the
derivative of a constant times a function,
573:58 - I can just pull the constant out. More generally,
the antiderivative of a constant A times any
573:59 - function, little f of x is just going to equal
A times the antiderivative of little f of
574:00 - x, which I'll denote with capital F of X,
plus a constant C. The antiderivative of f
574:01 - of x plus g of x is capital F of X, plus capital
G of x plus c, where capital F and capital
574:02 - G are the antiderivative of lowercase F and
lowercase J. This is because the derivative
574:03 - of a sum is equal to the sum of the derivatives.
Let's use this information to compute the
574:04 - antiderivative for f of x equals five over
one plus x squared minus one over two times
574:05 - the square root of x. First, I'm going to
rewrite f of x as five times one over one
574:06 - plus x squared minus one half times x to the
minus one half. I know that the antiderivative
574:07 - of one over one plus x squared is arctangent
of x. And by the power rule for anti differentiating
574:08 - the antiderivative of x to the minus one half,
I get by raising the exponent by one, negative
574:09 - one half plus one is positive one half, and
then dividing by the new exponent by my constant
574:10 - multiplication rules, I can just multiply
by my constants. And that's my antiderivative
574:11 - capital F of X, I've have to remember the
plus C for the general antiderivative, I can
574:12 - simplify a little bit by canceling these one
halves. And I get a final answer of five times
574:13 - arc tan of x minus a squared of x plus C.
In this video, we introduced anti derivatives
574:14 - and build a table of anti derivatives based
on our knowledge of derivatives. In this video,
574:15 - we'll solve problems where we're given an
equation for the derivative of the function.
574:16 - And we're given an initial condition, something
like f of one equals seven. And we have to
574:17 - find the function f of x. In this first example,
suppose g prime of x is e to the x minus three
574:18 - times sine x. and g of two pi is five, we
need to find g of x. Well, g of x is an antiderivative
574:19 - of e to the x minus three sine x. So g of
x is of the form e to the x plus three cosine
574:20 - of x plus a constant C. That's because the
derivative of e to the x is e to the x, the
574:21 - derivative of cosine x is minus sine x, and
the derivative of a constant is just zero.
574:22 - Now I need to find the value of the constant
C that makes this initial condition come true.
574:23 - If I plug in two pi for x, I get e to the
two pi plus three times cosine of two pi plus
574:24 - C, and that needs to equal five. Since cosine
of two pi is one, I have that e to the two
574:25 - pi plus three plus c equals five. And so C
is equal to two minus e to the two pi. So
574:26 - my function g of x is equal to either the
x plus three cosine x Plus two minus e to
574:27 - the two pi. In this example, we're given the
second derivative of f. And we're given two
574:28 - initial conditions, f of one is zero, and
f of zero is two.
574:29 - To start, I'm going to rewrite f double prime
of x in a more manageable form. by distributing,
574:30 - I get the square root of x times x minus the
square root of x over x. and rewriting with
574:31 - exponents, we get x to the three halves minus
x to the minus one half. Next, I'm going to
574:32 - find f prime of x, which is the antiderivative
of f double prime of x. So f prime of x, using
574:33 - the power rule for anti derivatives, I raised
the exponent of three halves by one to get
574:34 - five halves, and then divide by the new exponent
five halves. Similarly, I raised negative
574:35 - one half by one to get one half and divide
by the new exponent one half. And I'll add
574:36 - on a constant see, let me simplify a little
here, instead of dividing by five halves,
574:37 - multiply by two fifths, and instead of dividing
by one half, multiply by two. Now I've got
574:38 - an expression for f prime of x, but I need
an expression for f of x, which is the antiderivative
574:39 - of f prime, and so all anti differentiate
again. So now I have two fifths times x to
574:40 - the seven halves over seven halves minus two
times x to the three halves over three halves,
574:41 - the antiderivative of a constant C is C times
x, and then I'll add on a new constant D.
574:42 - After simplifying a bit, I'm ready to use
my initial conditions, in order to solve for
574:43 - my constant C and D. When I plug in zero for
x, all my x terms vanish, I'm just left with
574:44 - D, so d has to equal two. So I can rewrite
my function, setting D equal to two. And now
574:45 - my second condition says that f of one equals
zero. So plugging in one for x, I get 430
574:46 - fifths minus four thirds plus c plus two,
and that has to equal zero, which means that
574:47 - c is negative two, minus 430 fifths, plus
four thirds, which simplifies to minus 80
574:48 - to 100, and fifths. If we plug that in for
C, we get a final answer for f of x. And that
574:49 - finishes the problem. In this final example,
we're not given any equations, so we have
574:50 - to make them up ourself, we're told that we're
standing at the edge of a cliff, at height
574:51 - 30 meters, with throw a tomato up in the air
at an initial velocity of 20 meters per second.
574:52 - The tomato then falls down to the ground due
to gravity. And we want to find how long that
574:53 - takes and what its velocity is at impact.
We know that the acceleration due to gravity
574:54 - is negative 9.8 meters per second squared.
If we're working in metric units. The similar
574:55 - figure if we're working in units of feet,
is negative 32 feet per second squared. The
574:56 - negative sign is because gravity is pulling
objects down towards the ground in the negative
574:57 - direction. We're also given the initial condition,
that velocity at time zero is 20 meters per
574:58 - second. That's a positive velocity because
we're throwing the tomato up. And we're told
574:59 - that the initial position s of zero is 30
meters. So let's start with the equation that
575:00 - acceleration is negative 9.8. In other words,
S double prime of t is negative 9.8. Therefore,
575:01 - S prime of t is negative 9.8 t plus a constant
c one. And from my initial condition about
575:02 - velocity, I know that s prime of zero is 20.
So in other words, S prime of zero is negative
575:03 - 9.8 times zero plus c one that has to equal
20. Which means that c one is equal to 20.
575:04 - Substituting in 20 for C one, I can rewrite
s prime of t Now I can find f of t, the antiderivative
575:05 - of S prime. And that's going to be negative
9.8 times t squared over two plus 20 t plus
575:06 - a second constant C two.
575:07 - Using my second initial condition, f of zero
equals 30. I can plug in zero for t, and get
575:08 - an expression that equals 30. Since all the
terms drop out, besides the C two, that tells
575:09 - me that C two is 30. And so I can find my
equation position by substituting 34 c two.
575:10 - Now I want to find out how long it takes the
tomato to hit the ground. So that's going
575:11 - to be the time when s of t equals zero. Setting
zero equal to my expression for S of t, I
575:12 - can use the quadratic formula to solve for
t, and I get t equals approximately negative
575:13 - 1.17, or 5.25. The negative time doesn't make
sense for the problem. So I'm left with a
575:14 - time of impact of 5.25 seconds. Now to find
the velocity of the impact, I need to plug
575:15 - that time into my velocity equation. In other
words, my equation for S prime. So s prime
575:16 - of 5.25, is 9.8 times 5.25, plus 20, which
simplifies to negative 31.45 meters per second,
575:17 - probably enough to squash the tomato. And
that's all for this video on finding anti
575:18 - derivatives using initial conditions. In this
video, I'll use the mean value theorem to
575:19 - show that the antiderivative zero has to be
a constant. And then any two anti derivatives
575:20 - of the same function have to differ by a constant.
In a previous video, I stated the fact that
575:21 - if f of x is one antiderivative of a function,
little f of x, than any other antiderivative
575:22 - of that same function can be written in the
form capital F of x plus C for some constant
575:23 - C. In other words, any two antiderivative
of the same function have to differ by a constant.
575:24 - To prove this fact, let's first note that
if the derivative of a function, g prime of
575:25 - x is equal to zero on an interval than the
original function, g of x must equal C for
575:26 - some constant C. This statement follows from
the mean value theorem, because the mean value
575:27 - theorem tells us that for any x one and x
two in our interval, the average rate of change
575:28 - between x one and x two is equal to the derivative
at some number x three in between x one and
575:29 - x two. But by assumption, g prime is zero
everywhere on the interval, so g prime of
575:30 - x three must be equal to zero. This means
that our numerator, g of x want to minus g
575:31 - of x one has to equal zero. In other words,
g of x two is equal to g of x one, but that's
575:32 - true for any x one and x two. So all the values
of G are equal, and G must be a constant.
575:33 - The second observation that I want to make
is that if G one and G two are two functions,
575:34 - which have the same derivative, then g one
of x must equal g two of x plus C for some
575:35 - constant C. This statement follows from the
previous statement, because if G one prime
575:36 - of x is equal to g two prime of x, then g
one prime of x minus g two prime of x must
575:37 - equal zero. But that means if I look at the
function g one of x minus g two of x, and
575:38 - take its derivative, that has to equal zero,
since the derivative The difference is the
575:39 - difference of the derivatives. Now our previous
statement tells us that if the derivative
575:40 - of a function is zero, the function must be
a constant, and therefore, g one of x minus
575:41 - g two of x equals C for some constant C, which
means that g one of x is equal to g two of
575:42 - x plus C, which is what we wanted to prove.
So we've proved that any two functions with
575:43 - the same derivative have to differ by a constant
or in other words, If capital F of X is one
575:44 - antiderivative of a function than any other
antiderivative must be of the form capital
575:45 - F of x plus C. This concludes the proof that
any two anti derivatives of a particular function
575:46 - must differ by a constant. This video will
review summation notation, that is, the sigma
575:47 - notation used to write a song.
575:48 - In this expression, using the greek capital
letter sigma, the letter I is called the index.
575:49 - The number one is called the lower limit of
summation, or the starting index. And the
575:50 - number five is called the upper limit of summation,
or the ending index, we evaluate this expression
575:51 - by summing up to the I, for all values of
i starting from one and ending at five and
575:52 - stepping through the integers. In other words,
we start with i equals one and take two to
575:53 - the one. And then we add to it two to the
two, two to the Three, two to the four, and
575:54 - two to the five. If we do the arithmetic,
this comes out to 62. In the second expression,
575:55 - our index is J, and we start with J equals
three and go up to J equals seven, once again,
575:56 - stepping through integer values. So we have
to add up 1/3 plus 1/4, plus 1/5, plus one,
575:57 - six, and then our last term is one seven.
This sum is equal to 153, over 140. When we're
575:58 - given a psalm like this one, it can be handy
to write it in sigma notation, because it's
575:59 - more compact. But to do so, we have to look
for the pattern between the terms. In this
576:00 - case, the terms all differ by three. So I
can think of nine as being six plus three,
576:01 - and 12, as being six plus twice, three, and
15 as being six plus three times three, and
576:02 - so on. In fact, we can even think of six itself
as being six plus zero times three to fit
576:03 - this pattern. Now we can write the sum as
sigma of six plus i times three, where I ranges
576:04 - from zero to four. Here, we're thinking of
six plus three as six plus one times three.
576:05 - Now, there are other ways to write this sum
and sigma notation. For example, we could
576:06 - notice that each of the terms is a multiple
of three. And in fact, six is three times
576:07 - two, nine is three times three, and so on.
And so we could write our sum as sigma of
576:08 - three times n, where n ranges from two to
six. The choice of the letter we use for the
576:09 - index doesn't matter at all. For example,
we could also write this as sigma from K equals
576:10 - two to six of three times k. Here, k and n
play the same role. Please pause the video
576:11 - for a moment and try to write this next example
in sigma notation. Since the denominators
576:12 - are powers of two, we could write the denominators
as two to the i, where i ranges from two to
576:13 - five. The numerators are one less than the
denominators, so we can write the numerators
576:14 - as two to the i minus one was we're adding
these terms up, we write sigma, and we I go
576:15 - from two to five. In this video, we reviewed
summation notation, or sigma notation for
576:16 - writing sums. In this video, we'll approximate
the area under a curve using tall skinny rectangles,
576:17 - this will introduce the idea of an integral.
Let's start by approximating the area under
576:18 - this curve y equals x squared in between x
equals zero, and x equals three by approximating
576:19 - it with six rectangles.
576:20 - There's several ways to do this. For example,
I could draw rectangles for the right side
576:21 - of each rectangle is as tall as the curve.
We'll call this using write endpoints. Alternatively,
576:22 - we could line up our rectangles, so the left
side of each rectangle is as high as the curve.
576:23 - We'll call this use Left endpoints. Notice
that the leftmost rectangle in this picture
576:24 - is degenerate and has height zero. If we're
using the picture with the right endpoints,
576:25 - then the base of each rectangle has size one
half. And the height of each rectangle is
576:26 - given by the value of our function, y equals
x squared on the right side of the rectangle.
576:27 - So for example, the area of the first rectangle
is its base times its height, which is point
576:28 - five times 0.5 squared. The 0.5 squared comes
from me evaluating the function at this point
576:29 - 0.5 to get the height. Similarly, the area
of the second rectangle is going to be also
576:30 - base times height basis, still point five,
and now the height is going to be one squared,
576:31 - or one. If we continue like this, and add
up all our areas, we get the area of all six
576:32 - rectangles is given by this expression. Notice
that there are six terms here, one for each
576:33 - rectangle, each rectangle has base of point
five, and has height given by the right endpoint,
576:34 - we can write this in sigma notation as the
sum of 0.5 times 0.5 times i squared, where
576:35 - I ranges from one to six. This works because
the numbers in parentheses here are all multiples
576:36 - of point five. The first one is point five
times one, and the last one, three is point
576:37 - five times six. Now if we compute the sum,
we get 91 eighths, which is 11.375. Notice
576:38 - from the picture, that the sum of areas of
rectangles is an over estimate for the area
576:39 - under the curve, we can do the same sort of
computation for this green picture using left
576:40 - endpoints, and we'll get an under estimate
for the area under the curve, I invite you
576:41 - to try it for yourself before going on with
the video. For the green rectangles, the first
576:42 - rectangle has area zero, the second rectangle
has area given by its base of 0.5 times its
576:43 - height of 0.5 squared. And if we compute all
six areas and add them up, we get a similar
576:44 - expression to the previous one, only this
time, we end with a 2.5 squared, which is
576:45 - the height of our last rectangle. One way
to write this in sigma notation, is still
576:46 - starting with i equals one for the first rectangle
to six for the last one, we use the base.
576:47 - And then for the height, we use 0.5 times
I minus one,
576:48 - squared.
576:49 - This works because when I is one, i minus
one is zero, so we start with a height of
576:50 - zero like we should. And when I is six, we
get point five times six minus one, which
576:51 - is point five times five, or 2.5, just like
we want it to be, if we add up the sum, we
576:52 - get an answer of 55 eighths, which is equal
to 6.875, which is an underestimate for the
576:53 - true area under the curve. Now there's a big
gap between 6.875 and 11.375. So it'd be nice
576:54 - to get tighter bounds on the area. One way
to do this is by using more rectangles, for
576:55 - example, 12 rectangles instead of six. Again,
we could choose to use right endpoints, which
576:56 - gives us an over estimate of area in this
case, or we could use left endpoints, which
576:57 - gives us an under estimate. The area of the
eyes rectangle is given by the base times
576:58 - the height, and the base is going to be in
this case 0.25. While the height is given
576:59 - by the functions value on the right endpoint,
the right endpoint of the eyes rectangle is
577:00 - going to be 0.25 times I and the function
is the squaring function. So that height will
577:01 - be given by point two, five i squared. The
area of all the rectangles can then be given
577:02 - by the sum from i equals one to 12 for the
12 rectangles of 0.25 times 0.25 i
577:03 - squared.
577:04 - If we work out that sum, it comes to 10.156.
Again, we can do the same thing with left
577:05 - endpoints. Now the area of the eye, the rectangle,
is given by base times height, which is point
577:06 - two, five. And now the height is given by
the value of the function on the left endpoint.
577:07 - So that's going to be 0.25 times I minus one.
And we need to square that, since our function
577:08 - y equals x squared is giving the height of
my rectangles. So the area of all the rectangles
577:09 - together is going to be the sum from the first
rectangle to the 12th rectangle of 0.25 times
577:10 - 0.25, times I minus one
577:11 - squared.
577:12 - That works out to 7.906. So we're honing in
on the actual area under the curve. Now it's
577:13 - somewhere between about eight and about 10,
we can keep getting better and better estimates
577:14 - of area by using more and more rectangles.
For example, if we want to use 100 rectangles,
577:15 - then our area of all rectangles using right
endpoints is going to be given by the sum
577:16 - from i equals one to 100 of the basis times
the heights. Now the base of each rectangle
577:17 - will be 100 of the length here from zero to
three. In other words, the base will be three
577:18 - over 100. The eyes right endpoint, which I'll
call X sub i, is going to be just three over
577:19 - 100 times I, since you get to the right eye
threat endpoint by taking I copies of a rectangle
577:20 - of width three one hundredths. Therefore,
the eyes height is going to be given by this
577:21 - is right endpoint squared, or three one hundredths
times i squared. So we can write our sum of
577:22 - areas as sigma from i equals one to 100 of
three one hundredths times three one hundredths
577:23 - times i squared. The formula using left endpoints
is similar. The if left endpoint is going
577:24 - to be three one hundredths, times I minus
one, since if we're using left endpoints,
577:25 - we only have to travel through i minus one
rectangles to get to the left endpoint of
577:26 - the rectangle. So our area for the left endpoints
becomes the sum from i equals one to 100 of
577:27 - three over 100 times three over 100 times
I minus one squared. These two psalms work
577:28 - out to be 9.1435 and 8.8654. At this point,
you might be willing to wager a guess that
577:29 - our exact area under the curve is probably
going to be nine. But to determine the exact
577:30 - area for sure, let's do this process of dividing
into rectangles one more time. And this time,
577:31 - we'll just use an rectangles where n is some
big number. Since we're dividing an interval
577:32 - of length three into n little pieces, the
width of each sub interval, in other words,
577:33 - the base of each rectangle, we'll be given
by three over n. I'll call this delta x as
577:34 - a little tiny bit of x. Now the right endpoint,
x by is given by three over n times i. Since
577:35 - we have to travel through I rectangles, each
of width three over n on order to get to that
577:36 - right endpoint. So our height, H sub i is
given by the functions value on that right
577:37 - endpoint. We can work out similar expressions
for the picture using left endpoints here.
577:38 - Our estimate of area using right endpoints
is then the sum from i equals one to n of
577:39 - three over n times three I over n squared.
And our estimate using left endpoints is a
577:40 - sum from i equals one to n of three over n
times three, i minus one over n squared, the
577:41 - more rectangles we use, in other words, the
bigger the value of n, the closer our estimated
577:42 - area will be to our exact area under the curve.
And therefore, the exact area is given by
577:43 - the limit the limit as n goes to infinity
of this song, which is known as a Riemann
577:44 - sum,
577:45 - there are really two possible limits, we could
use right endpoints or left endpoints. But
577:46 - as the picture suggests, these two limits
should turn out to be the same thing. In fact,
577:47 - there are other options between sides using
right endpoints and left endpoints, we could,
577:48 - for example, use the midpoints of our intervals
to compute our areas of rectangles. And that
577:49 - limit should also end up as the same thing.
So we have an expression for the area under
577:50 - the curve y equals x squared
577:51 - between the
577:52 - values of x equals one and x equals three.
And that's given by the limit of this psalm
577:53 - called a Riemann sum. I'll stick with the
right endpoint version for now, to compute
577:54 - the exact area, we have to evaluate this limit,
which is tricky. I'm going to start by rewriting.
577:55 - Since three and n don't involve the index
I, I can pull them outside of this summation
577:56 - sign. I'll clean this up a little bit. Now
will you need to use the fact that the sum
577:57 - of the first n squares of the integers is
equal to n times n plus one times two n plus
577:58 - one
577:59 - over six,
578:00 - we can check that formula for a few values
of n. For example, if n equals two, we're
578:01 - summing out one squared plus two squared,
which is five. And we're plugging in two times
578:02 - two plus one times four plus one over six
from the formula, which also equals five.
578:03 - If we use this formula, in our limit calculation,
we get this expression, which simplifies to
578:04 - nine halves, by dividing 27 by six, we can
cancel a copy of n and get n plus one times
578:05 - two n plus one over n squared. I'm going to
pull out the nine halves. And now I observe
578:06 - I have the limit of a rational expression,
where the highest power term on the numerator
578:07 - is going to be two n squared, the highest
power and there's nominators just the n squared,
578:08 - so that's going to be a limit of two, multiply
that by by nine halves, and I get a limit
578:09 - of nine, just like I expected from the previous
work. So that was a big production. But we
578:10 - did successfully find the area under the curve,
and it was nine. In this video, we approximated
578:11 - the area under a curve by taking the limit
as the number of rectangles goes to infinity
578:12 - of the area of the rectangles, which is given
by a psalm called a Riemann sum of the basis
578:13 - times the heights of the rectangles. The basis
are often written as delta x, and the heights
578:14 - are given by the function value on the left
endpoint, or the right endpoint, or some other
578:15 - point in the interval. For our purposes, f
was always x squared. But this sort of expression,
578:16 - called a Riemann sum, can be used more generally,
to evaluate the area under any continuous
578:17 - function. In previous sections, we thought
of the definite integral as representing area,
578:18 - and we've computed it as a number. In this
section, we'll think of the integral itself
578:19 - as a function of the bounds of integration.
And we'll describe the first part of the fundamental
578:20 - theorem relating the derivative and the integral.
Suppose f of x has the graph shown here, and
578:21 - let g of x be the integral from one to x of
f of t dt. I'm using t as my variable inside
578:22 - my integrand Here, just to distinguish it
from the variable x that I'm using in my bounds
578:23 - of integration, this expression just means
the net area between one and some value x
578:24 - on the x axis. I'll call geovax, the accumulated
area function, because as x increases, g of
578:25 - x, measures how much net area has accumulated.
Let's calculate and plot some values of g
578:26 - of x. g of one is the integral from one to
one of f of t, dt, that's just zero. Since
578:27 - the bounds of integration here the same, g
of two is the integral from one to two of
578:28 - f of t, dt. That's the net area from one to
two, which is to square units. g of three
578:29 - is the integral from one to three. Now, we've
added on an additional two units here, and
578:30 - an additional one unit up here from this triangle,
for a total of five, g of four is g of three
578:31 - with some additional area tacked on the additional
578:32 - area measures three units. So g of four is
eight. Please pause the video and fill in
578:33 - the next few values of J.
578:34 - When we go from g of four to g of five, we
add on an extra unit of area. So g of five
578:35 - is nine. As we go from g of five to g of six,
we start accumulating negative area, because
578:36 - f is now below the x axis. So here I've accumulated
one unit of negative area, which means that
578:37 - g of six is one less than g of five. In other
words, gf six is eight, g of seven is five.
578:38 - Since we accumulate three more units of negative
area, to find g of zero, the integral from
578:39 - one to zero of f of t dt, I'm going to rewrite
this integral as negative the integral from
578:40 - zero to one of f of t dt. Since there are
two units of area between zero and one, g
578:41 - of zero is negative to apply all these values
of G on these coordinate axes, and connect
578:42 - the dots to get an idea of what g of x looks
like. Now let's think about the derivative
578:43 - g prime of x. We know that g prime of x is
positive, where g of x is increasing, but
578:44 - g of x is increasing, wherever we're adding
on positive area, that is when f of x is positive.
578:45 - So we have that g prime of x is positive,
where f is x is positive.
578:46 - Also,
578:47 - g prime of x is negative, where g of x is
decreasing. That happens when we're adding
578:48 - on negative area because f of x is negative.
So we can see that g prime of x is negative,
578:49 - where f of x is negative. Also, g prime is
zero at this local maximum, where f is zero.
578:50 - At that instant, we're not adding on any positive
or negative
578:51 - area.
578:52 - If we look a little closer, we can see the
rate at which g of x is increasing depends
578:53 - on the height of f of x. When f of x is tall,
or high, we're adding on area very quickly.
578:54 - While when f of x is low or small, we're adding
on area more slowly. So the rate of change
578:55 - of G. In other words, g prime of x is behaving
very much like the function f of x itself.
578:56 - And in fact, it turns out that g prime of
x is equal to f of x. This is the first part
578:57 - of the fundamental theorem of calculus.
578:58 - The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part One
says that of f of x is a continuous function
578:59 - on the closed interval from a to b, then for
any x in this interval, the function g of
579:00 - x, the integral from a to x of f of t dt is
continuous on the interval a b and differentiable
579:01 - on the inside of this interval, and for Furthermore,
g prime of x is equal to f of x, as we saw
579:02 - in the previous example. The proof of this
fact relies on a limit definition of derivative,
579:03 - and can be found in a later video. For now,
let's do some examples based on this fact.
579:04 - First, let's find the derivative with respect
to x of the integral from five to x of the
579:05 - square root of t squared plus three dt. The
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that
579:06 - this expression here thought of as a function
of x is differentiable, and its derivative
579:07 - is just the integrand function evaluated on
x. This is great, we don't have to do any
579:08 - work here at all. To evaluate the derivative,
we just plug in x, where we see the T here,
579:09 - the derivative and the second expression is
also the square root of x squared plus three,
579:10 - it might seem odd that these two expressions
have the same derivative. But remember, in
579:11 - both cases, we're taking the derivative of
the accumulated area function. And the rate
579:12 - at which area accumulates doesn't depend on
the lower bound of the integral. That is,
579:13 - it doesn't depend on where we start counting,
it just depends on the height of the function
579:14 - at x.
579:15 - For this third example, remember that the
integral from x to four is the same thing
579:16 - as the negative of the integral from four
to x. So we get the negative of the derivative
579:17 - from four to x. and applying the fundamental
theorem of calculus, this lesson is negative
579:18 - the square root of x squared plus three, it
makes sense that we should get a negative
579:19 - answer for this example. When we're integrating
from X to four, then as x increases, our area
579:20 - actually decreases. So our accumulated area
function should have a negative derivative.
579:21 - This last example is more complicated, because
instead of just having x as our upper bound,
579:22 - we have a function of x sine of x, we can
think of sine of x as being the inside function,
579:23 - and the accumulated area function as being
an outside function and apply the chain rule.
579:24 - In general, the chain rule says that we have
the derivative with respect to x of a function
579:25 - of u of x, then that's the same thing as the
derivative with respect to u of that function
579:26 - at U times the derivative of the inside function
u of x with respect to x, applying the chain
579:27 - rule to our accumulated area function, where
you have x is sine x, we have that the derivative
579:28 - respect to x of the integral from four to
sine x of the integral of t squared plus three
579:29 - DT can be written as the derivative by two
you, I've accumulated area function from four
579:30 - to you have the integrand times the derivative
with respect to x of our u of x, which is
579:31 - just sine x, we can apply the fundamental
theorem of calculus to calculate the first
579:32 - derivative. By just plugging in you for T,
we get you squared plus three. And then the
579:33 - derivative of sine x, of course, is just cosine
of x. Since we want our final answer to be
579:34 - entirely in terms of x, we're going to rewrite
this as the square root of sine x squared
579:35 - plus three times cosine x, or just the square
root of sine squared x plus three times cosine
579:36 - of x. We could have gotten this answer more
quickly by just plugging in this entire expression
579:37 - sine of x in where we saw the T here in the
integrand, and then multiplying the answer
579:38 - by the derivative of sine x due to the chain
rule.
579:39 - This video introduced the fundamental theorem
of calculus part one that says that the derivative
579:40 - of the integral of a function is just the
original function in some sense, taking the
579:41 - derivative and does the process of taking
the integral. derivatives and integrals are
579:42 - closely related. inverse operations. This
video introduces the second part of the fundamental
579:43 - theorem of calculus. Another way of relating
derivatives and integrals. Part Two of the
579:44 - fundamental theorem of calculus says that
if f is a continuous function on the closed
579:45 - interval a b, then the integral from a to
b of f of x dx is equal to capital F of b
579:46 - minus capital F of A, where capital F is any
antiderivative for lowercase F. That is, capital
579:47 - F is a function whose derivative is lowercase
F. The proof of part two of the fundamental
579:48 - theorem of calculus follows directly from
part one. And I'll give that proof in another
579:49 - video. But here, I just want to make a few
comments about what this theorem means. If
579:50 - we think of f of x as the derivative of capital
F of x, then this is saying that the integral
579:51 - of the derivative is equal to the original
function evaluated on the endpoints. I also
579:52 - want to comment on the phrasing any antiderivative.
Suppose capital G of X is a different antiderivative
579:53 - for lowercase F. We know that any two anti
derivatives differ by a constant. So we know
579:54 - that g of x has to equal capital F of X plus
some constant. So if we take g of b minus
579:55 - g of a, that's going to be the same thing
as f of b plus c minus f of a plus C. And
579:56 - since this constant sees subtract out to cancel
here, this is just f of b minus f of a. So
579:57 - this difference is the same value, no matter
which antiderivative of lowercase f we use.
579:58 - And that's why we can say that capital F can
be any antiderivative. Part Two of the fundamental
579:59 - theorem of calculus is super useful, because
it allows us to compute integrals simply by
580:00 - finding anti derivatives and evaluating them.
Finding anti derivatives tends to be really
580:01 - easy. Computing integrals, using the Riemann
sum definition is really hard. And so because
580:02 - of the fundamental theorem of calculus, we
don't have to go through all those lengthy
580:03 - and tedious computations, we've involving
limits of areas of rectangles, all we have
580:04 - to do to evaluate an integral is find an antiderivative,
and evaluate it. Let's see how this works
580:05 - in some examples. In this first example, the
antiderivative of 3x squared is x cubed. And
580:06 - the antiderivative of negative four over x
is minus four times ln absolute value of x.
580:07 - We could add a plus C to make it a general
antiderivative, but we don't really need it.
580:08 - The fundamental theorem says that we can use
any antiderivative, so we might as well use
580:09 - the simplest one, where c equals zero. Now
we need to evaluate this antiderivative on
580:10 - the endpoints of negative one and negative
five. And we usually write this as a vertical
580:11 - line with a negative one at the bottom and
a negative five at the top to mean evaluation.
580:12 - In other words, the notation capital F
580:13 - of X
580:14 - between A and B means capital F of b minus
capital F of A, which is what we need to compute
580:15 - for our antiderivative here. So now we just
plug in negative five for x, and then we subtract
580:16 - what we get when we plug in negative one for
x. In this example, you can see why it's important
580:17 - to write the antiderivative of one over x
as ln absolute value of x not just ln of x,
580:18 - because ln of the absolute value of five,
which is ln a five actually has an answer,
580:19 - whereas ln of negative five would not exist.
I can simplify this expression a little bit,
580:20 - I get negative 125 minus four ln five minus
negative one, plus four ln of one. Since ln
580:21 - of one is zero, this becomes negative 124
minus four ln five. That's about negative
580:22 - 130 point 438. In this next example, we need
to find the antiderivative for this expression
580:23 - y squared minus y plus one over the square
root Why. Now we can't take the antiderivative
580:24 - separately of the numerator and the denominator,
because that's just not how the quotient rule
580:25 - works for differentiation. So it doesn't work
that way for anti differentiation either.
580:26 - Instead, let's try to simplify this expression
to make it look more like something we can
580:27 - take the antiderivative of. So I'm going to
rewrite the denominator as y to the one half
580:28 - power. And dividing by y to the one half is
the same thing as multiplying by y to the
580:29 - negative one half distributed, distributing
and adding exponents, I get y to the three
580:30 - halves minus y to the one half plus y to the
negative one half. Now that's something I
580:31 - can take the antiderivative of just using
the power rule and reverse y to the three
580:32 - halves, becomes y to the five halves by adding
one to the exponent, I divide by the new exponent.
580:33 - Now here, I get y to the three halves divided
by three halves, and here are negative one
580:34 - half plus one is positive one half, I need
to evaluate this between four and one. let
580:35 - me simplify a little bit. And now I'll substitute
in values. Now four to the five halves is
580:36 - the same thing as four to the one half raised
to the fifth power. So that's two to the fifth
580:37 - power, or 32. Similarly, for the three halves
is four to the one half cubed, so that's two
580:38 - cubed, or eight, and four to the one half
is just two. And one to any power is just
580:39 - one. And after some arithmetic, I get an answer
of 146 15th.
580:40 - The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, part
two can be stated this way, for a function
580:41 - capital F with continuous derivative, the
integral of the derivative is equal to the
580:42 - original function evaluated on the bounds
of integration. In this video, I'll prove
580:43 - both parts of the fundamental theorem of calculus.
The first part of the fundamental theorem
580:44 - of calculus says that if f of x is a continuous
function, then the function g of x defined
580:45 - as the integral from a constant A to the variable
x of f of t dt is differentiable, and has
580:46 - derivative equal to the original function,
580:47 - f of x.
580:48 - To prove this theorem, let's start with the
limit definition of derivative. The derivative,
580:49 - g prime of x, by definition, is the limit
as h goes to zero of g of x plus h minus g
580:50 - of x over h. Now g of x is defined as an integral
from a to x. So g of x plus h is going to
580:51 - be the integral from a to x plus h, just plugging
in x plus h for x of f of t dt. g of x is
580:52 - the integral from a to x
580:53 - of f of t dt.
580:54 - By properties of integrals. The integral from
a to x plus h minus the integral from a to
580:55 - x is just the integral from x to x plus h.
Now informally, the integral from x to x plus
580:56 - h can be closely approximated by a skinny
rectangle with height, f of x and width, H.
580:57 - And so this limit is approximately the limit
as h goes to zero of f of x times h over h,
580:58 - which is just f of x. But let's make this
argument a little more precise. Let's let
580:59 - capital M be the maximum value that f of x
achieves on this little sub interval, and
581:00 - lowercase m be the minimum value achieved.
In this picture, they occur on the endpoints
581:01 - of the interval from x to x plus h, but they
could also occur somewhere in the interior.
581:02 - But we know that f of x does have to have
a minimum value and a maximum value, since
581:03 - it's a continuous function by assumption on
a closed interval. Now we know that the integral
581:04 - of f of t dt from x to x plus h has to be
less than or equal to capital M times h and
581:05 - bigger than a to lowercase m times h. This
is one of the properties of integrals, and
581:06 - can be verified visually by comparing this
shaded red area to the small blue rectangle,
581:07 - which has area lowercase m times h, and comparing
it to the area of the big rectangle, which
581:08 - has area capital M times h equivalently, the
integral from x to x plus H of F of t dt divided
581:09 - by h has to be less than or equal to capital
M and greater than or equal to little m. But
581:10 - the intermediate value theorem, which holds
for all continuous functions, says that this
581:11 - intermediate value that lies between the minimum
and maximum value of f has to be achieved
581:12 - as f of c for some C in the interval. Therefore,
I cannot replace this integral in the limit
581:13 - expression above by just simply the value
f of c for some c between x and x plus h.
581:14 - The value of C here depends on x and h. But
as h goes to zero, C has to get closer and
581:15 - closer to x. And since f is continuous, this
means that this limit is equal to
581:16 - f of x.
581:17 - We've now proved the first part of the fundamental
theorem of calculus, that the derivative of
581:18 - g exists and equals f of x. The second part
of the fundamental theorem of calculus says
581:19 - that if f is continuous, then the integral
from a to b of f of x dx is equal to the antiderivative
581:20 - of lowercase F, which I'll denote by capital
F, evaluated at B minus that antiderivative
581:21 - evaluated today. Part Two of the fundamental
theorem follows directly from part one. Let's
581:22 - let g of x be defined as the integral from
a to x of f of t dt. Then part one of the
581:23 - fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that
g prime of x exists and equals lowercase f
581:24 - of x. In other words, capital G is an antiderivative
for a lowercase F. Now g of the minus g of
581:25 - A is by definition, the integral from a to
b of f of t dt minus the integral of a from
581:26 - a to a of f of t dt. The second integral is
zero, since the bounds of integration are
581:27 - identical. So part two of the fundamental
theorem of calculus is true if I use the antiderivative
581:28 - capital
581:29 - G.
581:30 - But the theorem is supposed to be true for
any antiderivative. So let's let capital F
581:31 - be any antiderivative of lowercase F, we know
that capital F of x has to equal capital G
581:32 - of X plus some constant since any two antiderivative
for the same function differ by a constant,
581:33 - and therefore, capital F of b minus capital
F of A is going to equal capital G of B plus
581:34 - C minus capital G of A plus C. The constant
C cancels out, and we just get capital G of
581:35 - b minus capital G of A, which we already saw
was equal to the integral from a to b of lowercase
581:36 - f of t dt. So the left side of this equation
is equal to the right side. And the fundamental
581:37 - theorem of calculus Part two is proved for
any antiderivative. This completes the proof
581:38 - of the fundamental theorem of calculus. This
video is about the substitution method for
581:39 - evaluating integrals, also known as u substitution.
As the first example, let's try to integrate
581:40 - to x sine of x squared dx. Now sine of x squared
is the composition of the function sine and
581:41 - the function x squared. And notice that the
function x squared has derivative to x, which
581:42 - is sitting right here and the integrand. I'm
going to make the substitution u equals x
581:43 - squared, and then I'll write d u is equal
to 2x dx. That's differential notation. To
581:44 - find d u, I take the derivative have X squared
and then multiply by the differential dx,
581:45 - I can then rewrite the integrand as sine of
u. And the 2x. dx becomes do after making
581:46 - this substitution, I can integrate, because
the antiderivative of sine of u is negative
581:47 - cosine of u. And I'll add on the constant
of integration. I'm not finished yet, my original
581:48 - problem was in terms of x, and now I've got
a function in terms of u. So let's substitute
581:49 - back in since u is equal to x squared, I can
replace that, and I have my final answer.
581:50 - To verify that this final answer is correct,
that it really is the antiderivative of what
581:51 - we started with, let's take the derivative
of our answer and make sure we get back the
581:52 - function to x sine of x
581:53 - squared.
581:54 - If we take the derivative of negative cosine
of x squared plus C, then we get the derivative
581:55 - of a constant is zero, so we have the derivative
of negative cosine, that's equal to sine of
581:56 - the inside function x squared times the derivative
of the inside function using the chain rule.
581:57 - And we do in fact, get back to the integrand
that we started with. Notice that we use the
581:58 - chain rule when taking the derivative to check
our answer. Let's try some more examples of
581:59 - use substitution. When looking for what to
substitute as you, it's good to look for a
582:00 - chunk that's in the integrand, whose derivative
is also in the integrand. It's also good enough
582:01 - to just have a constant multiple of the derivative
in the integrand. So in the first example,
582:02 - we might use the chunk one plus 3x squared,
as are you. The derivative of that expression
582:03 - is six times x. And even though six times
x isn't completely in the integrand, we do
582:04 - have a factor of x in the numerator, that's
just a constant multiple away from the derivative
582:05 - of 6x. So let's write out d u, that's going
to be 6x dx. And I'm going to go ahead and
582:06 - rewrite this as x dx is equal to one six d
U. writing it this way, it makes it easy to
582:07 - substitute one six d u for x dx. And then
in my denominator, my one plus 3x squared
582:08 - becomes u. I can rewrite this as one six times
the integral of one over u d u you and I recognize
582:09 - that the antiderivative of one over u is ln
absolute value of u. Substituting back in
582:10 - for you, I get a final answer of one six ln
absolute value of one plus 3x squared, plus
582:11 - say, the absolute value signs are not really
necessary in this example, since one plus
582:12 - 3x squared is always positive. As our next
example, let's look at the integral of e to
582:13 - the 7x dx. one chunk with us here is u equals
7x. If we do that, then d u is just seven
582:14 - dx.
582:15 - And so we have dx is equal to 1/7 do substituting
in we have the integral of e to the u times
582:16 - 1/7 d u, I can pull the 1/7 out and integrate
e to the u to the app, just either the U and
582:17 - substituting in for back for 7x, I get e to
the 7x plus C. I encourage you to pause the
582:18 - video to check that these two answers are
correct. By taking derivatives. You'll notice
582:19 - that you use the chain rule each time. Next,
let's do an example with a definite integral,
582:20 - the integral from E to E squared of ln x over
x dx. If we set u equal to ln x, then d u
582:21 - is the derivative of ln x, that's one of our
x times dx. This is a much better choice of
582:22 - you than say setting u equal to x from the
denominator, because then d u would just be
582:23 - dx. And when we did the substitution, nothing
would really change. For definite integrals,
582:24 - we need to deal with the bounds of integration
here e and d squared. We really have two options,
582:25 - worry about them now or worry about them later.
I'll show you the worry about them. Now method
582:26 - first. Our bounds of integration E and E squared
are values of Bax as we convert everything
582:27 - in our integral from x to you, we need to
convert the bounds of integration from values
582:28 - of x to values of u also. Now, when x is equal
to e, u is equal to ln IV, which is one, just
582:29 - using this equation. Similarly, when x is
equal to E squared, u is equal to ln t squared,
582:30 - which is two. So as I rewrite my integral,
I'm going to replace the bounds with one and
582:31 - two. And now my ln x becomes my u and my dx
divided by x becomes my do, they're going
582:32 - to grow of UD u is equal to use squared over
two, and I evaluate this between the bounds
582:33 - of u equals two and u equals one to get two
squared over two minus one squared over two,
582:34 - which is one half. Notice that when we did
the problem this way, we never actually had
582:35 - to get back to our variable x, we stayed in
the variable u and evaluated. The second way
582:36 - of dealing with the bounds of integration
is to worry about them later. Let's go back
582:37 - to the beginning of the problem. We're just
about to substitute u equals ln x and d u
582:38 - equals one over x dx. Instead of substituting
in for the bounds of integration, I'm going
582:39 - to temporarily ignore them and just evaluate
the indefinite integral ln x over x dx, which
582:40 - I can substitute in as you times do, we can
evaluate that to get you squared over two.
582:41 - Normally we'd have a plus c constant. But
since we're ultimately going to be doing a
582:42 - definite integral, we don't really need the
constant here. Now, just like when we're doing
582:43 - indefinite integrals, I'm going to get back
to the variable x by substituting back in
582:44 - for you U is ln of x. So I square that and
divided by two, and then I can go back to
582:45 - my original bounds of integration, those bounds
are the x values of E squared, and E. Plugging
582:46 - in those bounds, I get ln of E squared quantity
squared over two minus ln of E squared over
582:47 - two, which evaluates to two squared over two
minus one over two, which is again, one half.
582:48 - This video gave some examples of use substitution
to evaluate integrals. This method works great
582:49 - in examples like this one, where there's a
chunk that you can call you whose derivative
582:50 - or at least a constant multiple of its derivative
is also in the integrand.
582:51 - You've already seen how u substitution works
in practice. In this video, I'll try to explain
582:52 - why it works. u substitution is based on the
chain rule. Recall the chain rule says if
582:53 - we take the derivative of a function, capital
F of lowercase g of x with respect to x, we
582:54 - get the derivative of capital F evaluated
on the inside function g of x times the derivative
582:55 - of g of x.
582:56 - If we just write that equation in the opposite
order, we have that an expression of the form
582:57 - f prime of g of x times g prime of x can all
be wrapped up as the derivative of a composite
582:58 - function, f of g of x. Now if I take the integral
of both sides of this equation with respect
582:59 - to x, on the right side, I'm taking the integral
583:00 - of a derivative.
583:01 - Well, the integral or antiderivative of a
derivative is just the original function,
583:02 - capital f of g of x plus C. Now when we do
use substitution, we're really just writing
583:03 - this equation down. We are seeing an expression
of the form f prime of g of x times g prime
583:04 - of x dx, we're recognizing you as g of x and
d u as g prime of x dx. So we're rewriting
583:05 - this expression as the integral of capital
F prime of u d u do and that integrates to
583:06 - just capital F of u plus C. And then we're
substituting back in for you To get capital
583:07 - f of g of x plus C, the beginning and end
of this process are exactly the same as the
583:08 - left side and right side of our chain rule
expression above. So when you're doing u substitution
583:09 - to integrate, you can thank this chain rule
that's behind it all. This video introduces
583:10 - the idea of an average value of a function.
To take the average of a finite list of numbers,
583:11 - we just add the numbers up and divide by n,
the number of numbers. In summation notation,
583:12 - we write the sum from i equals one to n of
Q i all divided by n. But defining the average
583:13 - value of a continuous function is a little
different. Because a function can take on
583:14 - infinitely many values on an interval from
a to b, we could estimate the average value
583:15 - of the function by sampling it at a finite
Li many evenly spaced x values. I'll call
583:16 - them x one through x n. And let's assume that
they're spaced a distance of delta x apart,
583:17 - then the average value of f at these sample
points is just the sum of the values of f
583:18 - divided by n, the number of values are in
summation notation, the sum from i equals
583:19 - one to n of f of x i all divided by n. This
is an approximate average value of f, since
583:20 - we're just using n sample points. But the
approximation gets better as the number of
583:21 - sample points n gets bigger and bigger. So
we could define the average as the limit as
583:22 - n goes to infinity of the sample average.
I'd like to make this look more like a Riemann
583:23 - sum. So I need to get delta x in there. So
I'm just going to multiply the top and the
583:24 - bottom by delta x. And notice that n times
delta x is just the length of the interval
583:25 - b minus a. Now as the number of sample points
goes to infinity, delta x, the distance between
583:26 - them goes to zero. So I can rewrite my limit
as the limit as delta x goes to zero, of the
583:27 - sum of FX II times delta x divided by b minus
a. Now the limit of this Riemann sum in the
583:28 - numerator is just the integral from a to b
of f of x dx. And so the average value of
583:29 - the function is given by the integral on the
interval from a to b divided by the length
583:30 - of the interval. Notice the similarity between
the formula for the average value of a function
583:31 - and the formula for the average value of a
list of numbers, the integral for the function
583:32 - corresponds to the summation sign for the
list of numbers. And the length of the interval
583:33 - B minus A for the function corresponds to
n, the number of numbers in the list of numbers.
583:34 - Now let's work an example. For the function
g of x equals one over one minus 5x. On the
583:35 - interval from two to five, we know that the
average value of G is given by the integral
583:36 - from two to five of one over one minus 5x
dx divided by the length of that interval,
583:37 - I'm going to use use of the tuition to integrate,
so I'm going to set u equal to one minus 5x.
583:38 - So d u is negative five dx. In other words,
dx is negative 1/5 times do. Looking at my
583:39 - bounds of integration, when x is equal to
two, u is equal to
583:40 - one minus five times two, which is negative
nine. And when x is equal to five, u is equal
583:41 - to negative 24. substituting into my integral,
I get the integral from negative nine to negative
583:42 - 24 of one over u times negative 1/5. Do and
that's divided by three. Now dividing by three
583:43 - is same as multiplying by 1/3. And as I integrate,
I'm going to pull the negative 1/5 out and
583:44 - then take the integral of one over u, that's
ln of the absolute value of u evaluated in
583:45 - between negative 24 and negative nine. The
absolute value signs are important here because
583:46 - they prevent me from trying to take the natural
log of negative numbers to evaluate
583:47 - get negative 1/15 times ln of 24 minus ln
of nine, I can use my log rolls to simplify
583:48 - and get negative 1/15 ln of 24 over nine,
that's negative 1/15 ln of eight thirds, and
583:49 - as a decimal, that's approximately negative
0.0654. So I found the average value of G.
583:50 - Now my next question is, does g ever achieve
that average value, in other words, is there
583:51 - a number c in the interval from two to five
for which GFC equals its average value? Well,
583:52 - one way to find out is just to set GFC equal
to G's average value. In other words, set
583:53 - one over one minus five c equal to negative
1/15 ln of eight thirds, and try to solve
583:54 - for C. There are lots of ways to solve this
equation. But I'm going to take the reciprocal
583:55 - of both sides, subtract one from both sides
and divide by negative five. This simplifies
583:56 - to three over ln of eight thirds, plus 1/5,
which is approximately 3.25. And that x value
583:57 - does lie inside the interval from two to five.
So we've demonstrated that g does achieve
583:58 - its average value over the interval. But in
fact, we could have predicted this to be true.
583:59 - Gs average value has to lie somewhere between
GS minimum value and maximum value on this
584:00 - interval. And since G is continuous on the
interval from two to five, it has to achieve
584:01 - every value that lies in between as minimum
and maximum, including its average value.
584:02 - The same argument shows that for any continuous
function, the function must achieve its average
584:03 - value on an interval. And this is known as
the mean value theorem for integrals. Namely,
584:04 - for any continuous function f of x on an interval
from a to b, there has to be at least one
584:05 - number c, between A and B, such that f of
c equals its average value, or, in symbols,
584:06 - f of c equals the integral from A b of f of
x dx divided by b minus a. This video gave
584:07 - the definition of an average value of a function,
and stated the mean value theorem for integrals.
584:08 - If we rewrite the formula for average value
a little, then we can see a geometric interpretation
584:09 - for average value, the area of the box with
height the average value is the same as the
584:10 - area under the curve. This video gives two
proofs of the mean value theorem for integrals.
584:11 - the mean value theorem for integrals says
the for continuous function f of x, defined
584:12 - on an interval from a to b, there's some number
c between A and B, such that f of c is equal
584:13 - to the average value of f. The first proof
that I'm going to give us is the intermediate
584:14 - value theorem. Recall that the intermediate
value theorem says that if we have a continuous
584:15 - function f, defined on an interval, which
I'll call x 1x, two, if we have some number
584:16 - l in between f of x one and f of x two, then
f has to achieve the value out somewhere between
584:17 - x one and x two. Keeping in mind the intermediate
value theorem, let's turn our attention back
584:18 - to the mean value theorem for integrals. Now
it's possible that our function f of x might
584:19 - be constant on the interval from a to b. But
if that's true, then our mean value theorem
584:20 - for integrals holds easily, because f AV is
just equal to that constant, which is equal
584:21 - to f OC for any c between A and B. So let's
assume that f is not constant. Well, like
584:22 - continuous function on a closed interval has
to have a minimum value and a maximum value,
584:23 - which I'll call little m, and big M. Now we
know that F's average value on the interval
584:24 - has to be between its maximum value and its
minimum value. If you don't believe this,
584:25 - consider the fact that all of us values on
the interval have to lie between big M and
584:26 - little m. And if we integrate this inequality
584:27 - We get little m times b minus a is less than
or equal to the integral of f is less than
584:28 - or equal to big M times b minus a. Notice
that the first and the last integrals, we're
584:29 - just integrating a constant. Now if I divide
all three sides by b minus a, I can see that
584:30 - little m is less than or equal to the average
value of f is less than or equal to big M
584:31 - as I wanted. Now, I just need to apply the
intermediate value theorem, with F average
584:32 - as my number L and little m and big M as my
values of f of x one and f of x two. The intermediate
584:33 - value theorem says that F average is achieved
by f of c for some C in between my x one and
584:34 - x two. And therefore, for some C in my interval
a b. And that proves the mean value theorem
584:35 - for integrals. Now I'm going to give a second
proof for the mean value theorem for integrals.
584:36 - And this time, it's going to be as a corollary
to the regular mean value theorem for
584:37 - functions. Recall that the mean value theorem
for functions, says that if g of x is continuous
584:38 - on a closed interval,
584:39 - and differentiable on the interior of that
interval, then there's some number c in the
584:40 - interval, such that the derivative of g at
C is equal to the average rate of change of
584:41 - G, across the whole interval from a to b.
Let's keep the mean value theorem for functions
584:42 - in mind, and turn our attention back to the
mean value theorem for integrals. I'm going
584:43 - to define a function g of x to be the integral
from a to x of f of t dt, where F is the function
584:44 - given to us in the statement of the mean value
theorem for integrals. Notice that g of A
584:45 - is just the integral from a to a, which is
zero, while g of B is the integral from a
584:46 - to b of our function. Now, by the fundamental
theorem of calculus, our function g of x is
584:47 - continuous and differentiable on the interval
a, b, and g prime of x is equal to f of x.
584:48 - And by the mean value theorem for functions,
we know that g prime of c has to equal g of
584:49 - b minus g of a over b minus a, for some numbers,
C and the interval a b, if we substitute in
584:50 - the three facts above, into our equation below,
we get f of c is equal to the integral from
584:51 - a to b of f of t dt minus zero over b minus
a, which is exactly the conclusion that we
584:52 - wanted to reach. This shows that the mean
value theorem for integrals really is the
584:53 - mean value theorem for functions where our
function is an integral. And this completes
584:54 - the second proof of the main value theorem
for integrals. So now I've proved the mean
584:55 - value theorem for integrals in two different
ways. And I've used a lot of the great theorems
584:56 - of calculus along the way.

Cleaned transcript:

This video is about working with rational expressions. A rational expression is a fraction, usually with variables in it, something like x plus two over x squared minus three is a rational expression. In this video, we'll practice adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing rational expressions, and simplifying them to lowest terms. We'll start with simplifying to lowest terms. Recall, if you have a fraction with just numbers in it something like 21 over 45, we can reduce it to lowest terms by factoring the numerator and factoring the denominator and then canceling common factors. So in this example, the three is cancel, and our fraction reduces to seven over 15. If we want to reduce rational expression with variables and add to lowest terms, we proceed the same way. First, we'll factor the numerator, that's three times x plus two, and then factor the denominator. In this case of factors 2x plus two times x plus two, we could also write that as x plus two squared. Now we cancel the common factors. And we're left with three over x plus two. Definitely a simpler way of writing that rational expression. Now next, let's practice multiplying and dividing. Recall that if we multiply two fractions with just numbers in them, we simply multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. So in this case, we would get four times two over three times five or 8/15. If we want to divide two fractions, like in the second example, then we can rewrite it as multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction on the denominator. So here, we get four fifths times three halves, and that gives us 12 tenths. But actually, we could reduce that fraction to six fifths, we use the same rules when we compute the product or quotient of two rational expressions with variables on them. Here, we're trying to divide to rational expressions. So instead, we can multiply by the reciprocal, I call this flipping and multiplying. And now we just multiply the numerators. And multiply the denominators. It might be tempting at this point to multiply out to distribute out the numerator and the denominator. But actually, it's better to leave it in this factored form and factored even more completely. That way, we'll be able to reduce the rational expression to cancel the common factors. So let's factor even more the x squared plus x factors as x times x plus one, and x squared minus 16. And that's a difference of two squares, that's x plus four times x minus four, the denominator is already fully factored, so we'll just copy it over. And now we can cancel common factors here and here, and we're left with x times x minus four. This is our final answer. Adding and subtracting fractions is a little more complicated because we first have to find a common denominator. A common denominator is an expression that both denominators divided into, it's usually best of the long run to use the least common denominator, which is the smallest expression that both denominators divided into. In this example, if we just want a common denominator, we could use six times 15, which is 90 because both six and 15 divided evenly into 90. But if we want the least common denominator, the best way to do that is to factor the two denominators. So six is two times 315 is three times five, and then put together only the factors we need for both six and 15 to divide our numbers, so if we just use two times three times five, which is 30. We know that two times three will divide it and three times five will also divide it and we won't be able to get a denominator any smaller because we need the factor of two three and five, in order to ensure both these numbers divided, once we have our least common denominator, we can rewrite each of our fractions in terms of that denominator. So seven, six, I need to get a 30 in the denominator, so I'm going to multiply that by five over five, and multiply by the factors that are missing from the current denominator in order to get my least common denominator of 30. For the second fraction, for 1515 times two is 30. So I'm going to multiply by two over two, I can rewrite this as 3530 s minus 830 s. And now that I have a common denominator, I can just subtract my two numerators. And I get 27/30. If I factor, I can reduce this to three squared over two times five, which is nine tenths. The process for finding the sum of two rational expressions with variables in them follows the exact same process. First, we have to find the least common denominator, I'll do that by factoring the two denominators. So 2x plus two factors as two times x plus 1x squared minus one, that's a difference of two squares. So that's x plus one times x minus one. Now for the least common denominator, I'm going to take all the factors, I need to get an expression that each of these divides into, so I need the factor two, I need the factor x plus one, and I need the factor x minus one, I don't have to repeat the factor x plus one I just need to have at one time. And so I will get my least common denominator two times x plus one times x minus one, I'm not going to bother multiplying this out, it's actually better to leave it in factored form to help me simplify later. Now I can rewrite each of my two rational expressions by multiplying by whatever's missing from the denominator in terms of the least common denominator. So what I mean is, I can rewrite three over 2x plus two, I'll write the 2x plus two is two times x plus one, I'll write it in factored form. And then I noticed that compared to the least common denominator, I'm missing the factor of x minus one. So I multiply the numerator and the denominator by x minus one I just needed in the denominator, but I can't get away with just multiplying by the denominator without changing my expression, I have to multiply by it on the numerator and the denominator. So I'm just multiplying by one and a fancy form and not changing the value here. So now I do the same thing for the second rational expression. I'll write the denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what's missing from the denominator. What's missing in this denominator, compared to my least common denominator is just the factor two. So I multiply the numerator and the denominator by two. Now I can rewrite everything. So the first rational expression becomes three times x minus one over two times x plus 1x minus one, and the second one becomes five times two over two times x plus 1x minus one, notice that I now have a common denominator. So I can just add together my numerators. So I get three times x minus one plus 10 over two times x plus 1x minus one. I'd like to simplify this. And the best way to do that is to leave the denominator in factored form. But I do have to multiply out the numerator so that I can add things together. So I get 3x minus three plus 10 over two times x plus 1x minus one, or 3x plus seven over two times x plus 1x minus one. Now 3x plus seven doesn't factor. And there's therefore no factors that I can cancel out. So this is already reduced. As much as it can be. This is my final answer. In this video, we saw how to simplify rational expressions to lowest terms by factoring and canceling common factors. We also saw how to multiply rational expressions by multiplying the numerator and multiplying the denominator had divide rational expressions by flipping and multiplying, and how to add and subtract rational expressions by writing them in terms of the least common denominator. This video is about the difference quotient and the average rate of change. These are topics that are related to the concept of derivative and calculus. For function y equals f of x, like the function whose graph right here, a secant line is a lie. that stretches between two points on the graph of the function. I'm going to label this x value has a, and this x value as B. So this point here on the graph is going to have an x value of a, and a y value given by f of a, the second point will have x value B and Y value, f of b. Now the average rate of change for a function on the interval from a to b can be defined as the slope have the secret line between the two points A, F of A and B, F of B. In symbols, that slope m is the rise over the run, or the change in y over the change in x, which is the difference in Y coordinates f of b minus F of A over the difference in x coordinates b minus a. So this is the average rate of change. To put this in context, if for example, f of x represents the height of a tree, and x represents time in years, then f of b minus f of a represents a difference in height, or the amount the tree grows. And B minus A represents a difference in in years, so a time period. So this average rate of change is the amount the tree grows in a certain time period. For example, if it grows 10 inches in two years, that would be 10 inches per two years, or five inches per year would be its average rate of change its average rate of growth, let's compute the average rate of change for the function f of x equals square root of x on the interval from one to four. So the average rate of change is f of four minus f of one over four minus one, well, f of four is the square root of four of one's the square root of one. So that's going to be two minus one over three or 1/3. Instead of calling these two locations on the x axis, a and b, this time, I'm going to call the first location, just x and the second location, x plus h. The idea is that h represents the horizontal distance between these two locations on the x axis. In this notation, if I want to label this point on the graph of y equals f of x, it'll have an x coordinate of x and a y coordinate of f of x. The second point will have an x coordinate of x plus h and a y coordinate of f of x plus h. a difference quotient is simply the average rate of change using this x x plus h notation. So a different version represents the average rate of change of a function, f of x on the interval from x to x plus h. Equivalent way, the difference quotient represents the slope of the secant line for the graph of y equals f of x between the points with coordinates x, f of x, and x plus h, f of x plus h. Let's work out a formula for the difference quotient. Remember that the formula for the average rate of change could be written as f of b minus F of A over B minus A, where a and b are the two locations on the x axis. But now I'm calling instead of a I'm using x instead of B, I'm using x plus h. So I can rewrite this average rate of change as f of x plus h minus f of x over x plus h minus x. That simplifies a little bit on the denominator. Because x plus h minus x, I can cancel the access and I get the difference quotient formula f of x plus h minus f of x over h. The quantity h on denominator It looks like a single entity, but it still represents a difference in x values. Let's find and simplify the difference quotient for this function given first or write down the general formula for the difference quotient. That's an F of x plus h minus f of x over h. I'm going to compute f of x plus h first, I do this by shoving in x plus h, everywhere I see an x in the formula for the function. So that's going to give me two times x plus h squared minus x plus h plus three. Notice how I use parentheses here. That's important, because I need to make sure I shove in the entire x plus h for x. So the entire x plus h needs to be subtracted, not just the x part, so the parentheses are mandatory. Similarly, the parentheses here signal that the entire x plus h is squared as it needs to be, I'm going to go ahead and simplify a bit right now, I can multiply out the x plus h squared, I can go ahead and distribute the negative sign. So if I multiply out, I'm gonna get x squared plus XH plus h x plus h squared. Now I can distribute the two to get to x squared plus 2x H plus two h x plus two h squared minus x minus h plus three, these two terms are actually the same, I can add them up to get 4x H. And I think that's as simple as I can get that part. Now, I'm going to write out F of x plus h minus f of x. So that's going to be this thing right here, minus f of x. Again, I need to put the F of X formula in parentheses to make sure I subtract the whole thing. I'll distribute the negative. And now I noticed that a bunch of things cancel out. So the 2x squared and the minus 2x squared add to zero, the minus x and the x add to zero, and the three and the minus three, add to zero. So I'm left with 4x H plus two h squared minus h. Finally, I'll write out the whole difference quotient by dividing everything by H. I can simplify this further, because notice that there's an H in every single term of the numerator. If I factor out this H, H times 4x, plus two h minus one divided by h, these two H's cancel, and I'm left with a difference quotient of 4x plus two h minus one. This difference quotient will become important in calculus, when we calculate the difference quotient for smaller and smaller values of h, eventually letting h go to zero, and ending up with an expression that has no H's in it, and represents the derivative or slope of the function itself. In this video, we use the formula f of b minus F of A over B minus A to calculate an average rate of change, and the related formula f of x plus h minus f of x over h to calculate and simplify a difference quotient. This video will introduce the idea of limits through some graphs and examples. When I worked in San Francisco, I used to eat at Julia sushi and salad bar that had an interesting price structure, the food there cost $10 a pound. But if you happen to load up your plate to exactly one pound, you got a free lunch. So let's let y equals f of x represent the price of your lunch in dollars as a function of its weight x in pounds. And I want to write an equation to describe f of x as a piecewise defined function. It makes sense to use a piecewise defined function. Because there are two situations, the weight x could be exactly one pound, or it could be different from one pound. If the weight is exactly one pound, then f of x The price is zero. But if x is different from a pound, then the price is 10 times x as a graph, my function is going to follow the line y equals 10x. But when x is exactly one, my function is going to have a value of zero and not 10. The open circle here represents a hole or a place where a point is missing on the graph. Now when x is near one, but not equal to one, then the F of X values that is the y values are very close to 10. In the language of limits, we say that the limit as x approaches one of F have x is equal to Ted. More informally, we can write, as x approaches one, f of x approaches 10. Notice that the value of f at one is actually equal to zero, not 10. And so the limit of f of x as x goes to one, and the value of f at one, are not equal. This illustrates the important fact that the limit here as x goes to one doesn't care about the value of f, at one, it only cares about the value of f, when x is near one, in general, for any function f of x, and for real numbers, a and L, the limit as x goes to a of f of x equals L means that f of x gets arbitrarily close to L, as x gets arbitrarily close to a, in other words, as x heads towards a, f of x heads towards L. Let me draw this as a picture. In this picture, I can say that the limit as x goes to a of f of x is L. Because by taking a sufficiently small interval around a of x values, I can guarantee that my y values, my f of x values lie in an arbitrarily small interval around L. Now the limit doesn't care about s value at exactly a. So if I change the function, if I change the functions value at a, or even leave the function undefined at a, the limit is still L. But the limit does care about what happens for x values on both sides of a. If, for example, the function didn't even exist for x values bigger than a, then we could no longer say that the limit, as x approached a was out, the limit would not exist. In other words, the limit of f of x is L, only if the y values are approaching now, as x approaches a from both the left and the right. For the function g of x graph below, the limit as x goes to two of g of x does not exist. Because the y values approach one as the x values approach two from the left and the y values approach three, as the x values approach two from the right. Although the limit doesn't exist, we can say that the left sided limit exists. And we write this as limit as x goes to two from the left of g of x is equal to one. The superscript minus sign here means that x is going to two from the left side. In other words, the x values are less than two and approaching two. Similarly, we can talk about right sided limits. In this example, the limit as x goes to two from the right side of g of x is three. And here, the superscript plus side means that we're approaching two from the right side. In other words, our x values are greater than to and approaching to. In general, the limit as x goes to a minus of f of x equals L means that f of x approaches L, as x approaches a from the left, and the limit as x goes to a plus of f of x equals our means that f of x approaches our as x approaches a from the right limits from the left or from the right are also called one sided limits. In this last example, let's look at the behavior of y equals h of x graph below when x is near negative two. As x approaches negative two from the right, our Y values are getting arbitrarily large, larger than any real number we might choose. We can write this in terms of limits by saying the limit as x goes to negative two from the right of h of x is equal to infinity. As x approaches negative two from the left, the y values are getting smaller. In fact, they go below any negative real number we might choose. In terms of limits, we can say that the limit as x goes to negative two from the left of h of x is negative infinity. In this example, the limit of h of x as x goes to negative two, not specifying from the left or the right means we have to approach negative two from both sides. And so this limit does not exist, because the limits from the left and the limit from the right are heading in opposite directions. I want to mention that some people say that the limits from the right and the limits from the left also do not exist. Because the functions don't approach any finite number. I prefer to say that these limits do not exist as a finite number. But they do exist as infinity and negative infinity. This video introduced the idea of limits, and one sided limits and infinite limits. This video gives some examples of when limits fail to exist. For this function, f of x graph below, let's look at the behavior of f of x in terms of limits, as x approaches negative one, one, and two. Let's start with x approaching negative one. When x approaches negative one from the last, the y value is going to be approaching about one half. When x approaches negative one from the right, the y values sandvi, approaching one. So when x approaches negative one, and we don't specify from either the left or the right, we can only say that the limit does not exist, because these two limits from the left and right are not equal. Now let's look at the limit as x is approaching one. This time, we approach from the left, we get a limiting y value of two, we approach from the right, the y values are going towards two. So both of these left and right limits are equal to and therefore the limit as x goes to one of f of x equals two. That's true, even though f of one f of one itself does not exist. The limit doesn't care what happens at exactly x equals one just what happens when x is near one. Finally, let's look at the limit as x goes to two. So here on the left side, the limit is going to negative infinity. And on the right side, it's negative infinity. So we can say the limit as x goes to two is negative infinity. Or we can also say that the limit as x goes to two does not exist. This is the correct answer. This is a better answer because it carries more information. What values of x does a limit of f of x fail to exist? Well, let's see. Negative one and two are the only two values. Let's talk about the ways that limits can fail to exist, we've seen at least a couple different ways. So we've seen examples where the limit from the left is not equal to the limit from the right. Here's our number a where we're calculating the limit at. So that's one example we've seen. We've also seen examples where they're vertical asymptotes. There's a vertical asymptote here at a, that limit fails to exist because of the unbounded behavior because the y values are going off to infinity. There's one other way that limits can fail to exist that comes up, sometimes not quite as frequently. And that's wild behavior. Not a technical term, just to descriptive term. Let's look at an example that has this wild behavior, forcing a limit not to exist. And the one of the most classic examples as the limit as x goes to zero of sine pi over x or sometimes you'll see sine one over x. If you graph this on your graphing calculator and zoom in near x equals zero, you're gonna see something that looks roughly like this. It just keeps oscillating up and down and up and down, as x goes towards zero As x goes towards zero, pi over x is getting bigger and bigger. And you're going to go through these oscillations between one and negative one for the faster and faster. From the other side, when x is negative, you'll see a similar kind of behavior just oscillating faster and faster. As x goes to zero, here, this top values up here at one, and the bottom value of these are all supposed to hit it negative one. Now, when you try to decide what the limit is, as x goes to zero, well, the y values are going through all possible real numbers and between negative one and one infinitely often as x goes to zero, so there's no single number that the limit can settle at. And so the limit as x goes to zero, of sine pi over x does not exist. In this video, we saw three types of examples when limits fail to exist, they can fail to exist because the one sided limits on the left and the right are not equal. Or they can fail to exist because of vertical asymptotes. Also, limits can fail to exist when there's wild behavior. And the function fails to settle down at any single value. This video is about limit laws, rules for finding the limits of sums, differences, products, and quotients and functions. Let's start with an example. Suppose that the limit as x goes to seven of f of x is 30. And the limit as x goes to seven of g of x is two. What's the limit as x goes to seven of f of x divided by negative three times g of x. Wilson's f of x is heading towards 30. And g of x is heading towards two, it makes sense that the quotient should head towards 30 divided by negative three times two, or negative five. in calculating this limit, by plugging in numbers for the components, we were actually using the limit loss, which are now state. Suppose that c is a constant, just some number, and that the limits as x goes to a of f of x and g of x exist as finite numbers that is not as limits that are infinity or negative infinity. Then the limit of the sum f of x plus g of x is equal to the limit of f of x plus the limit of g of x. In other words, the limit of the sum is the sum of the limits. Similarly, the limit of the difference is the difference of the limits. The limit of C times f of x is just c times the limit of f of x. And the limit of the product is the product of the limits. The limit of the quotient is the quotient of the limits, provided that the limit of g of x is not equal to zero. Since we can't divide by zero. Let's use these limit laws in an example, to find the limit as x goes to two of x squared plus 3x plus six divided by x plus nine. Well, the limit rule about quotients allows us to rewrite this limit of a quotient as a quotient of limits, provided that the limits of the numerator and denominator exist, and that the limit of the denominator is not zero. But we'll see in a moment that these conditions do in fact hold. Next, we can use the limit rule about sums to rewrite the numerator as a sum of limits. And we can rewrite the limit in the denominator also as a sum of limits. Next, we can use the limit rule about products to rewrite the limit of x squared as the square of the limit. That's because x squared is really x times x. And so the limit of x squared is really the limit of x times x, which by the product rule is a limit of x times the limit of x, which is the limit of x quantity squared. Going back to the original problem, we can now use the limit rule about multiplying by a constant to rewrite the limit of three times x as three times the limit of x. And I'll just carry the rest forward. Now that we've got things broken down into bite sized pieces, we can start evaluating some limits. Notice that the limit as x goes to two of x is just two, because as x heads towards 2x, heads towards two, so we can replace all these limits of access by just the number two. So we get two squared plus three times two. Now notice that the limit as x goes to two of six, well, six doesn't have any x's in it. So as x two heads towards to six days at six, and the limit here is just six. So in my original problem, I can replace the set limit of six with six. And on the denominator here, I get to plus nine. And after a little arithmetic, this simplifies to 16/11. Notice that we could have gotten this answer a lot faster, just by substituting in the value of two into our original expression. And in fact, that's the beauty of the lemon laws, they allow us to evaluate limits of rational functions, just by plugging in the number that x is going towards, as long as plugging in that number doesn't make the denominator zero. It's not nearly so simple. When plugging in the value does make the done at zero. And in the future, we'll build up a bunch of algebraic techniques for handling the situation. In this video, we've talked about the limit loss. It's important to note, these limit laws only apply if the limits of the component functions actually exist as finite numbers. If the limit of one or both of the component functions don't exist, then a limit rules just simply don't apply. And instead, we have to use other techniques to try to evaluate the limit of a sum, difference product or quotient. This video is about the squeeze theorem, which is another method for finding limits. Let's start with an example. Suppose we have a function g of x. We don't know much about it. But we do know that for x value is near one, g of x is greater than or equal to four times the square root of x drawn here in red, and less than or equal to 3x squared minus 4x plus five, drawn here in blue. So on the picture, G has to lie between the red and the blue curves for x values near one, it could look something like this. What can we say about the limit of g of x as x goes to one? Well, if you notice, the red curve and the blue curve have the exact same limit of four as x goes to one. And since the green curve is squeezed in between the red and the blue curve, its limit must also be for this example as a special case of the squeeze theorem. Now, let's say the squeeze theorem in general, suppose that we have three functions, f of x g of x and h of x. And let's suppose that f of x is less than or equal to g of x, which is less than or equal to h of x, at least for x values near some number A. this inequality doesn't necessarily have to hold for x equal to a, because we're going to be talking about limits. And limits don't care what happens when x is exactly a just when x is near a. Let's suppose also, that like in the previous example, f of x and h of x have the exact same limit as x approaches a. So we're going to suppose that the limit as x goes to a of f of x is equal to the limit as x goes to a of h of x. And we'll call this limit. Now. The picture looks a lot like the previous example. Again, it doesn't matter exactly what happens at x equals a, for example, g of x could have a hole there. And its value could be for example, way up here. Since g of x is trapped here in between f of x and h of x, which both have the same limit l at a, we can conclude that the limit as x goes to a of g of x is equal to l also. And that's the squeeze theorem, also known as the pinching theorem, and the sandwich theorem, three very descriptive names that capture the idea of geovax being trapped here, in between lower and upper bounds. Now let's use the squeeze there. To find the limit as x goes to zero of x squared sine one over x. Now, you might remember that sine one over x by itself has this crazy oscillating behavior. In fact, the limit as x goes to zero of sine one over x does not exist, because the function never settles down to a single finite value. At first glance, you might think the limit of x squared sine of one over x also wouldn't exist. In fact, it's tempting to try to use the product rule and say that the limit of the product is the product of the limits. But in fact, the product rule only applies when the component limits both exist. And since the second limit doesn't exist, the product rule tells us absolutely nothing about whether the limit that we're interested in exists or doesn't. So we can't use the product rule. But it turns out, we can use the squeeze theorem. Now this example is a little trickier than the first example, because in the first example, we were told what the upper and lower bounding functions should be. And in this example, we have to come up with. But if we look at a graph of x squared sine one over x, we can see that it does seem to be trapped in an envelope here. Let's use algebra to see what those two bounding functions might be. Now we know that sine of one over x is always between one and negative one, just because sine of anything has between one and negative one. And if we multiply this whole inequality by x squared, we get minus x squared is less than or equal to x squared, sine one over x, which is less than or equal to x squared. Notice that x squared is always positive, so we don't have to worry about flipping any of the inequality signs when we multiply by this positive number. So x squared and minus x squared are good bounding functions. And if we notice that the limit as x goes to zero of x squared is zero, and the limit as x goes to zero of negative x squared is also zero, we can conclude by the squeeze theorem, that the limit as x goes to zero of x squared, sine of one over x is also zero, because it squeezed in between these two functions with the same limit. the squeeze theorem is a great trick for evaluating limits when you happen to have a function that you're interested in, trapped in between two other functions with the same limit. The example in this video is a classic example, where we have a crazy oscillating trig function, multiplied by a power of x, that x is one of our bounding functions. In this video, we'll compute a bunch of limits using algebraic tricks. All these limits are of the zero over zero indeterminate form kind. Recall that this means that the limits are of the form the limit of f of x over g of x where the limit of f of x equals zero and the limit of g of x also equals zero. For a first example, let's look at the limit as x goes to one of x cubed minus one over x squared minus one. Notice that the numerator and the denominator are both going to zero as x goes to one. To calculate this limit, we want to simplify this expression. And one way to simplify it is to factor it. So let's rewrite this as the limit as x goes to one of x minus one times x squared plus x plus one. We're factoring the numerator here is a difference of cubes. We can also factor the denominator as a difference of squares, x minus one times x plus one. Now, as long as x is not equal to one, we can cancel out these two factors of x minus one. And so the limit of this expression is just the same as the limit of this expression. Now we can just plug in one, because plugging in one gives us a numerator of three and a denominator of two. And that way, we've evaluated our limits. Next, let's look at the limit of five minus z quantity squared minus 25. All divided by z. Once again, when we plug in x equals zero in the numerator, we get zero and then nominator we also get zero. This time instead of factoring, the trick is going to be to multiply out. So let's rewrite this limit as the limit as t goes to zero of 25 minus 10 z plus z squared minus 25. I just distributed to get this expression divided by z. Since 25 minus 25 is zero, I just have the limit as t goes to zero of negative 10 z plus c squared over z. Now what? Well, I could factor out the Z here. One z is not zero, I can cancel here. So my original limit is the same as this limit. Plugging in z equals zero, I just get negative 10 as my answer. This third example is also a situation where the numerator is going to zero, and the denominator is also going to zero. In this case, I'm going to try to simplify the expression by adding together the fractions and the numerator. So I'll need a common denominator, which is r plus three, times three. So rewriting, I get the limit of one over r plus three, I multiply that by three over three, in order to get the appropriate common denominator, minus 1/3, which I have to multiply by R plus three over r plus three, all that over are continuing to rewrite, I have in the numerator, adding together these fractions mature, have the denominator of R plus three times three, I get three minus quantity r plus three. And then this entire fraction is still divided by our distributing the negative sign, I have three minus r minus three divided by R plus three times three, all divided by R. three minus three is zero. So I can rewrite this as negative r over r plus three, times three. And now instead of dividing by r, which is r of r one, I can multiply by the reciprocal, one over R. R divided by R is one. So this expression simplifies to negative one, over r plus three, times three. So finally, I'm in a good position, because now I can just go ahead and let our go to zero. And by plugging in R equals zero, I have a limit of negative one over zero plus three times three, or negative one, nine. This example is a little tricky, because involve square roots can be hard to deal with. Well, there's one nice trick for dealing with square roots that works here, which is the conjugate. So I'm going to take the expression that we're given, and multiply by the conjugate of the numerator, in this case, because the numerator is the place where the square root is by the conjugate of A minus B, I just mean a plus b conjugate of A plus B is a minus b. Well, of course, if I multiply on the numerator, by something, I also have to multiply the denominator by the same thing, so that I won't alter the value of the expression. So this limit here is equal to the limit of the expression down here that looks more complicated, than in a moment, if we're lucky, things will clear up and become simpler. So Multiplying the numerators across, I get the square root of x plus three squared. I get plus two times the square root of x plus three minus two times the square root of x plus three minus four. On the denominator, I get x times the square root of x plus three plus 2x minus the square root of x plus three minus two. Let's see what simplifies here. So the square root of x plus three squared is just x plus three. And I see that this expression and this expression are opposites, so they subtract to zero here. So on the numerator, I just have x plus three, and then I still have the minus four on the denominator, nominator looks a little messy. I'll just copy it over for now. Okay, so on my numerator, I'm getting x minus one. Notice that when x goes to one, that numerator is still going to zero. And in fact, as I let x go to one, that denominator, if I plug in here, everything is gonna also cancel out to zero. So I still got a zero over zero indeterminate form. But maybe I can use one of the previous tricks of factoring. Because look at here, if I factor an X out of these two expressions as a square root of x plus three out of these two expressions, and I could maybe factor a two out of these two, factoring by grouping, let's try that. So we have x squared of x plus three times x minus one from these two expressions, and then I have a plus two times x minus one. From these two expressions, this is looking promising. So now I've got an x minus one on the top. And if I factor out the x minus one from each of these two expressions, I'm going to have an x minus one on the bottom times the square root of x plus three, plus two. Now, for x values near one, but not equal to one, I can cancel those. And my limit simplifies to just one over square root of x plus three plus two, plugging in one, I get a one on the numerator, and square root of four, which is two plus two, four on the denominator, and we have calculated this limit. Last example here, another zero over zero indeterminate form. Anytime I see an absolute value, I'm going to want to take cases, because the absolute value of X plus five naturally follows in the cases, if X plus five is greater than zero, in other words, x is greater than negative five, then the absolute value of this positive number is just itself. On the other hand, if X plus five is less than zero, in other words, x is less than negative five, than the absolute value of a negative number is its opposite. And we make the expression x plus five, turn it into its opposite by putting a negative sign in front. Now let's look at one sided limits. As x goes to negative five from the left, we have a situation where x is less than negative five, this situation right here. And so we can rewrite the absolute value by taking the negative of the expression. We still have a zero over zero and determinant form. But if we use the old factoring trick, factor out a two cancel, we got the limit of two over negative one, which is just negative two. We do the same exercise on the right side. When we're on the right, then x is greater than negative five. So we're in this situation here, where we can just replace the absolute value with the stuff inside and again factoring the numerator and canceling the X plus five We just get a limit of two. So we have a left limit, and a right limit that are different. And so in this example, the limit does not exist. So we've seen a five different kinds of limits all of the zero or zero indeterminate form. And we've used five different methods to evaluate them. For the first example, we use factoring. For the second example, do the opposite of factoring, we multiplied out. For the third example, we added together our rational expressions to simplify things. The next example uses the old multiply by the conjugate trick. And the last example, we used cases and looked at one sided limits. The limit law about quotients tells us that the limit of the quotient is the question of the limit, provided that the limits of the component functions actually exist, and that the limit of the function on the denominator is not equal to zero. But what happens if the limit of the function on the denominator is equal to zero? This video will begin to answer that question. In fact, there are two different situations we'll want to consider. It could be that even though the limit on the denominator is equal to zero, the limit on the numerator exists and is not equal to zero. Or it could happen that both limits are zero. We'll focus on the first situation, first starting with an example. And we'll look at the second situation later on. In this example, the limit of the numerator, negative 4x is just negative 12, which we can see by plugging in three for x. But the limit as x goes to three of the denominator is zero. So we're exactly in one of these situations where the numerator goes to a finite nonzero number, but the denominator goes to zero. Let's see what happens as we approach three from the left first. As we approach three from the left, x is going through numbers that are slightly less than three numbers like 2.9 2.99 2.999, and so on. If we plug in those numbers into the expression, here on our calculator, we didn't get answers of 116 1196, and 11,996. If even without a calculator, we could approximate these answers pretty closely by just thinking about the fact that since x is very close to three, the numerator is about negative four times three, so about negative 12. The denominator 2.9 minus three is negative 0.1. That quotient of two negative numbers gives us a positive value of 120. Similarly, we could approximate the value when x is 2.9 times as almost negative 12 divided by 0.01, which is 1200. And approximate the third value as 12,000. Either way, we do it exact answers on our calculator or approximations in our head when noticing that these values are positive numbers that are getting larger and larger as x goes towards three from the left. This makes sense. Because if we look at our expression, as x goes towards three from the left, the numerator is getting close to negative 12, which is a negative number. And the denominator, since x is less than three will always be a small negative number, negative over negative is a positive. And as x is getting really close to three, those denominators are getting smaller and therefore the fractions are getting bigger and bigger in magnitude. So we can conclude that our limit is positive infinity. We can make a similar argument By looking at the limit, as x goes to three from the positive side, it's supposed to be an X minus three here. So now x is going through a value is slightly bigger than three 3.1 3.01 3.01. And again, we can plug directly into our calculator and figure out the answers are negative 124. Negative 1204, negative 12,004. Or we can make a similar approximating argument. This answer is approximately negative 12 over a positive point one, which is negative 120, and so on. Like before, if we consider the signs of our numerator and denominator, we can see that as x goes to three, our numerator is a negative number. But our denominator is a positive number, since we're approaching three from the right where x is bigger than three, and therefore, our quotient is a negative number, it's still getting bigger and bigger in magnitude as x goes towards three, because the denominator is still getting tinier and tinier, while the numerator stays pretty close to negative 12. So in this case, we're getting a negative number that's bigger and bigger magnitude, so that makes a limit of negative infinity. Now, since our limit on the left is infinity, and our limit on the right is negative infinity, the only thing we can say about the limit as x goes to three is that it does not exist. Now let's look at another example. The limit as x goes to negative four of 5x, over the absolute value of x plus four, notice that the limit of the numerator is just negative 20 by plugging in negative four for x, and the limit of the denominator is zero. Because we've got an absolute value in our expression, here, it's screaming out at us to look at cases. Remember that the absolute value of x plus four is going to equal just x plus four, if x plus four is positive, in other words, if x is greater than negative four, however, if x is less than negative four, then the expression x plus four will be negative. So taking the absolute value has to switch at sign in order to make a negative expression positive. Alright, so that's going to come in handy when we look at the limit as x goes to negative four, from the left, and from the right. So when we approach negative four from the left, x is going to be less than negative four. So we're going to be in this situation here, where the absolute value gives us the opposite sign. That means that the limit as x goes to negative four minus of this expression, the same as the limit of 5x over negative x plus four. Now reasoning as before, as x is going to negative four from the left, the numerator here is a negative number. Pretty close to negative 20. The denominator, since x is less than negative 4x plus four is negative, the negative of it is positive. So our quotient is negative. And since denominator is getting really tiny, while the numerators will pretty level at at negative 20. This limit is going to be bigger and bigger magnitude a limit of negative infinity. Now let's look at the limit as x goes to negative four from the right, in this case, x is just a little bit bigger than negative four. So we're in this case where the absolute value doesn't change the expression. So we can rewrite this As 5x over x plus four, now the numerator is still gonna be a negative number, the denominator, since x is slightly bigger than negative four, slightly to the right, this expression is going to be positive number. Negative or over a positive is a negative. And again, since the denominator is getting tiny, the fractions getting huge in magnitude. And so this limit is negative infinity. Now, in this case, look at what's going on, we've got a negative infinity limit on the left and a negative infinity limit on the right. So we can conclude that the limit as x goes to negative four of 5x, over the absolute value of x plus four is equal to negative infinity. In fact, we can confirm that by looking at a graph. If we look, check out the graph near x equals negative four, it's gonna look something like this, with a vertical asymptote at x equals negative four, like expected. So we've seen that if the limit of f of x is equal to something that's not zero, and the limit of g of x is equal to zero, then the limit of the quotient could be negative infinity as it was in the past example. It could also be infinity, or it could just not exist. supposed to say does not exist, if the one sided limits are infinity on one side, and negative infinity on the other. Now, what about this second situation that I mentioned the beginning when the limit of f of x is zero, and the limit of f of g of x is zero? What can we say about the limit of the quotient in this situation? Well, in fact, in this situation, the limit of the quotient, it could exist and be any finite number, or infinity, or minus infinity, or it could not exist at all. In fact, in this sort of situation, which is called a zero, or zero indeterminate form, anything could happen. Which makes it in some ways the hardest, but in some ways, the most fun situation of all. So in another video, we'll talk about techniques for dealing with 00 indeterminate forms, and how to use algebra and other simplification techniques to evaluate these these mysterious limits. So in this video, we've looked at the limits of quotients, when the limit of the denominator is zero. We've done some examples when the limit of the numerator was not zero, but the limit of the denominator was zero. And we saw that these situations corresponded to vertical asymptotes, and gave us an answer for the limit of the quotient of infinity, or negative infinity, or sometimes infinity on one side and negative infinity on the other. We also hinted at fun things to come when we look at the limits in this situation when the numerator and the denominator are both heading towards zero. And when anything can happen. This video is about graphs and equations of lines. Here we're given the graph of a line, we want to find the equation, one standard format for the equation of a line is y equals mx plus b. here, m represents the slope, and B represents the y intercept, the y value, where the line crosses the y axis, the slope is equal to the rise over the run. Or sometimes this is written as the change in y values over the change in x values. Or in other words, y two minus y one over x two minus x one, where x one y one and x two y two are points on the line. While we could use any two points on the line, to find the slope, it's convenient to use points where the x and y coordinates are integers. That is points where the line passes through grid points. So here would be one convenient point to use. And here's another convenient point to use. The coordinates of the first point are one, two, and the next point this is let's say, five negative one. Now I can find this slope by looking at the rise over the run. So as I go through a run of this distance, I go through a rise of that distance, especially gonna be a negative rise or a fall because my line is pointing down. So let's see counting off squares, this is a run of 1234 squares and a rise of 123. So negative three, so my slope is going to be negative three, over four. I got that answer by counting squares. But I could have also gotten it by looking at the difference in my y values over the difference of my x values. That is, I could have done negative one minus two, that's from my difference in Y values, and divide that by my difference in x values, which is five minus one, that gives me negative three over four, as before, so my M is negative three fourths. Now I need to figure out the value of b, my y intercept, well, I could just read it off the graph, it looks like approximately 2.75. But if I want to be more accurate, I can again use a point that has integer coordinates that I know it's exact coordinates. So either this point or that point, let's try this point. And I can start off with my equation y equals mx plus b, that is y equals negative three fourths x plus b. And I can plug in the point one, two, for my x and y. So that gives me two equals negative three fourths times one plus b, solving for B. Let's see that two equals negative three fourths plus b. So add three fourths to both sides, that's two plus three fourths equals b. So b is eight fourths plus three fourths, which is 11 fourths, which is actually just what I eyeballed it today. So now I can write out my final equation for my line y equals negative three fourths x plus 11 fourths by plugging in for m and b. Next, let's find the equation for this horizontal line. a horizontal line has slope zero. So if we think of it as y equals mx plus b, m is going to be zero. In other words, it's just y equals b, y is some constant. So if we can figure out what that that constant y value is, it looks like it's to let's see, this three, three and a half, we can just write down the equation directly, y equals 3.5. For a vertical line, like this one, it doesn't really have a slope. I mean, if you tried to do the rise over the run, there's no run. So you'd I guess you'd be divided by zero and get an infinite slope. But But instead, we just think of it as an equation of the form x equals something. And in this case, x equals negative two, notice that all of the points on our line have the same x coordinate of negative two and the y coordinate can be anything. So this is how we write the equation for a vertical line. In this example, we're not shown a graph of the line, we're just get told that it goes through two points. But knowing that I go through two points is enough to find the equation for the line. First, we can find the slope by taking the difference in Y values over the difference in x values. So that's negative three minus two over four minus one, which is negative five thirds. So we can use the standard equation for the line, this is called the slope intercept form. And we can plug in negative five thirds. And we can use one point, either one will do will still get the same final answer. So let's use one two and plug that in to get two equals negative five thirds times one plus b. And so B is two plus five thirds, which is six thirds plus five thirds, which is 11 thirds. So our equation is y equals negative five thirds x plus 11 thirds. This is method one. method two uses a slightly different form of the equation. It's called the point slope form and it goes y minus y naught is equal to m times x minus x naught where x naught Why not is a point on the line, and again is the slope. So we calculate the slope the same way, by taking a difference in Y values over a difference in x values. But then we can simply plug in any point. For example, the point one, two will work, we can plug one in for x naught and two in for Y not in this point slope form, that gives us y minus two is equal to minus five thirds x minus one. Notice that these two equations, while they may look different, are actually equivalent. Because if I distribute the negative five thirds, and then add the two to both sides, I get the same equation as above. So we've seen two ways of finding the equation for the line is in the slope intercept form, and using the point slope form. In this video, we saw that you can find the equation for a line if you know the slope. And you know one point, you can also find the equation for the line if you know two points, because you can use the two points to get the slope and then plug in one of those points. To figure out the rest of the equation. We saw two standard forms for the equation of a line the slope intercept form y equals mx plus b, where m is the slope, and B is the y intercept. And the point slope form y minus y naught equals m times x minus x naught, where m again is the slope and x naught y naught is a point on the line. This video is about rational functions and their graphs. Recall that a rational function is a function that can be written as a ratio or quotient of two polynomials. Here's an example. The simpler function, f of x equals one over x is also considered a rational function, you can think of one and x as very simple polynomials. The graph of this rational function is shown here. This graph looks different from the graph of a polynomial. For one thing, its end behavior is different. The end behavior of a function is the way the graph looks, when x goes through really large positive, or really large negative numbers, we've seen that the end behavior of a polynomial always looks like one of these cases. That is why marches off to infinity or maybe negative infinity, as x gets really big or really negative. But this rational function has a different type of end behavior. Notice, as x gets really big, the y values are leveling off at about a y value of three. And similarly, as x values get really negative, our graph is leveling off near the line y equals three, I'll draw that line, y equals three on my graph, that line is called a horizontal asymptote. A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line that our graph gets closer and closer to as x goes to infinity, or as X goes to negative infinity or both. There's something else that's different about this graph from a polynomial graph, look at what happens as x gets close to negative five. As we approach negative five with x values on the right, our Y values are going down towards negative infinity. And as we approach the x value of negative five from the left, our Y values are going up towards positive infinity. We say that this graph has a vertical asymptote at x equals negative five. vertical asymptote is a vertical line that the graph gets closer and closer to. Finally, there's something really weird going on at x equals two, there's a little open circle there, like the value at x equals two is dug out. That's called a hole. A hole is a place along the curve of the graph where the function doesn't exist. Now that we've identified some of the features of our rational functions graph, I want to look back at the equation and see how we could have predicted those features just by looking at the equation. To find horizontal asymptotes. We need to look at what our function is doing when x goes through really big positive or really big negative numbers. Looking at our equation for our function, numerator is going to be dominated by the 3x squared term when x is really big, right, because three times x squared is going to be absolutely enormous compared to this negative 12. If x is a big positive or negative number in the denominator, the denominator will be dominated by the x squared term. Again, if x is a really big positive or negative number, like a million, a million squared will be much, much bigger than three times a million or negative 10. For that reason, to find the end behavior, or the horizontal asymptote, for our function, we just need to look at the terms on the numerator and the term on the denominator that have the highest exponent, those are the ones that dominate the expression in size. So as x gets really big, our functions y values are going to be approximately 3x squared over x squared, which is three. That's why we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals three. Now our vertical asymptotes, those tend to occur where our denominator of our function is zero. That's because the function doesn't exist when our denominator is zero. And when we get close to that place where our denominator is zero, we're going to be dividing by tiny, tiny numbers, which will make our Y values really big in magnitude. So to check where our denominators zero, let's factor our function. In fact, I'm going to go ahead and factor the numerator and the denominator. So the numerator factors, let's see, pull out the three, I get x squared minus four, factor in the denominator, that factors into X plus five times x minus two, I can factor a little the numerator a little further, that's three times x minus two times x plus two over x plus 5x minus two. Now, when x is equal to negative five, my denominator will be zero, but my numerator will not be zero. That's what gives me the vertical asymptote at x equals negative five. Notice that when x equals two, the denominators zero, but the numerator is also zero. In fact, if I cancelled the x minus two factor from the numerator and denominator, I get a simplified form for my function that agrees with my original function, as long as x is not equal to two. That's because when x equals two, the simplified function exists, but the original function does not it's zero over zero, it's undefined. But for every other x value, including x values near x equals two, our original function is just the same as this function. And that's why our function only has a vertical asymptote at x equals negative five, not one at x equals two, because the x minus two factor is no longer in the function after simplifying, it does have a hole at x equals two, because the original function is not defined there, even though the simplified version is if we want to find the y value of our hole, we can just plug in x equals two into our simplified version of our function, that gives a y value of three times two plus two over two plus seven, or 12 ninths, which simplifies to four thirds. So our whole is that to four thirds. Now that we've been through one example in detail, let's summarize our findings. We find the vertical asymptotes and the holes by looking where the denominator is zero. The holes happen where the denominator and numerator are both zero and those factors cancel out. The vertical asymptotes are all other x values where the denominator is zero, we find the horizontal asymptotes by considering the highest power term on the numerator and the denominator, I'll explain this process in more detail in three examples. In the first example, if we circle the highest power terms, that simplifies to 5x over 3x squared, which is five over 3x. As x gets really big, the denominator is going to be huge. So I'm going to be dividing five by a huge, huge number, that's going to be going very close to zero, and therefore we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero. In the second example, the highest power terms, 2x cubed over 3x cubed simplifies to two thirds. So as x gets really big, we're going to be heading towards two thirds and we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals two thirds. In the third example, the highest power terms x squared over 2x simplifies to x over two. As x gets really big, x over two is getting really big. And therefore, we don't have a horizontal asymptote at all. This is going to infinity, when x gets through goes through big positive numbers, and is going to negative infinity when x goes through a big negative numbers. So in this case, the end behavior is kind of like that of a polynomial, and there's no horizontal asymptote. In general, when the degree of the numerator is smaller than the degree of the denominator, we're in this first case where the denominator gets really big compared to the numerator and we go to zero. In the second case, where the degree of the numerator and the degree of the denominator equal, things cancel out, and so we get a horizontal asymptote at the y value, that's equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients. Finally, in the third case, when the degree of the numerator is bigger than the degree of the denominator, then the numerator is getting really big compared to the denominator, so we end up with no horizontal asymptote. Finally, let's apply all these observations to one more example. Please pause the video and take a moment to find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes and holes for this rational function. To find the vertical asymptotes and holes, we need to look at where the denominator is zero. In fact, it's going to be handy to factor both the numerator and the denominator. Since there if there are any common factors, we might have a hole instead of a vertical asymptote. The numerator is pretty easy to factor. Let's see, that's 3x times x plus one for the denominator, first factor out an x. And then I'll factor some more using a guess and check method. I know that I'll need a 2x and an X to multiply together to the to x squared, and I'll need a three and a minus one or also minus three and a one. Let's see if that works. If I multiply out 2x minus one times x plus three, that does give me back my 2x squared plus 5x minus three, so that checks out. Now, I noticed that I have a common factor of x in both the numerator and the denominator. So that's telling me I'm going to have a hole at x equals zero. In fact, I could rewrite my rational function by cancelling out that common factor, and that's equivalent, as long as x is not equal to zero. So the y value of my whole is what I get when I plug zero into my simplified version, that would be three times zero plus one over two times zero minus one times zero plus three, which is three over negative three or minus one. So my whole is at zero minus one. Now all the remaining places in my denominator that make my denominator zero will get me vertical asymptotes. So I'll have a vertical asymptote, when 2x minus one times x plus three equals zero, that is, when 2x minus one is zero, or x plus three is zero. In other words, when x is one half, or x equals negative three. Finally, to find my horizontal asymptotes, I just need to consider the highest power term in the numerator and the denominator. That simplifies to three over 2x, which is bottom heavy, right? When x gets really big, this expression is going to zero. And that means that we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero. So we found the major features of our graph, the whole, the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptotes. Together, this would give us a framework for what the graph of our function looks like. horizontal asymptote at y equals zero, vertical asymptotes at x equals one half, and x equals minus three at a hole at the point zero minus one. plotting a few more points, or using a graphing calculator of graphing program, we can see that our actual function will look something like this. Notice that the x intercept when x is negative one corresponds to where the numerator of our rational function or reduced rational function is equal to zero. That's because a zero on the numerator that doesn't make the denominator zero makes the whole function zero. And an X intercept is where the y value of the whole function is zero. In this video, we learned how to find horizontal asymptotes of rational functions. By looking at the highest power terms, we learned to find the vertical asymptotes and holes. By looking at the factored version of the functions, the holes correspond to the x values that make the numerator and denominator zero, his corresponding factors cancel. The vertical asymptotes correspond to the x values that make the denominator zero, even after factoring any any common any common factors in the numerator denominator. This video focuses on the behavior of functions and graphs, as x goes through arbitrarily large positive and negative values. You may have touched on these ideas before in the past when you studied horizontal asymptotes. But in this video, we'll talk about the same ideas in the language of limits. In this first example, what happens to the function f of x drawn below as x go through larger and larger positive numbers? Well, the arrow here on the end is supposed to mean the trend continues. So as x gets bigger and bigger, the values of y, that is f of x, get closer and closer to one, we can write this in the language of limits by saying the limit as x goes to infinity of f of x is equal to one. Now what happens to this function as x goes through larger and larger negative numbers, by larger and larger negative numbers, I mean numbers that are negative but are larger and larger in magnitude. So for example, negative five, negative 10, negative 100, and negative a million and so on. Well, assuming this trend continues, it looks like f of x, even though it's oscillating, it's settling down at a value of two. So we say that the limit as x goes to negative infinity, of f of x equals to limits in which x goes to infinity, or negative infinity are called limits at infinity. The phrase limits at infinity should be contrasted with the phrase infinite limits. An infinite limit means that the y values, or the F of X values go to infinity, or negative infinity. limits and infinity correspond to horizontal asymptotes, as drawn above, while infinite limits correspond to vertical asymptotes. The only exception to this when we don't have a horizontal or vertical asymptote is when x and f of x are both going infinite at the same time, we'll see an example of this on the next page. Let's figure out the limits of infinity for these two functions, g of x and h of x. The function g of x is actually the function e to the minus x, and it has a horizontal asymptote, heading right here at y equals zero. So the limit as x goes to infinity of g of x equals zero. But as we head to the left, and x goes through larger and larger negative values, our Y values don't settle down to a particular finite value, they get arbitrarily large. And so we say that the limit as x goes to minus infinity of g of x is equal to infinity. Now let's look at the graph of y equals h of x. Please pause the video for a moment and try to figure out the limits of infinity for this function. The limit as x goes to infinity of h of x is negative infinity. Because as x goes to infinity, the y values get below or more negative than any finite number. Now as X goes to negative infinity, the y values oscillate, and never settle down at a particular number. So we say that the limit as x goes to minus infinity of h of x does not exist. Finally, let's look at some limits of infinity of functions without looking at their graphs first, to find the limit as x goes to infinity of one over x. Let's think about what happens to one over x. As x gets bigger and bigger through positive numbers. As x gets bigger and bigger, one over x gets smaller and smaller. So the limit as x goes to infinity of one over x equals zero. To find the limit of one over x as x goes to negative infinity, let's look at what happens as X goes to negative numbers that are larger and larger in magnitude. Now one of our x goes through numbers that are negative, but they're still getting smaller and smaller. magnitude. So the limit as x goes to negative infinity of one over x is also zero. We can use similar reasoning to find the limit as x goes to infinity of one over x cubed. As x goes to infinity, x cubed also goes to infinity. So one of our x cubed has to go to zero. To find the limit as x goes to infinity of one over the square root of x, notice that as x goes to infinity, the square root of x still goes to infinity. So one over the square root of x also goes to zero. In other words, both of these limits are equal to zero. Both of these examples are actually closely related, because both have the form of the limit as x goes to infinity of one over x to the R, where R is a number greater than zero. In the second example, the square root of x is really x to the R, where R is one half. In fact, the limit as x goes to infinity of one over x to the R is always equal to zero. Whenever R is bigger than zero, we can even say the same thing about the limit as x goes to negative infinity of one over x to the R. As long as we avoid exponents, like one half that don't make sense for negative numbers. But for other values of r, as x goes to negative infinity, x to the R is getting bigger and bigger and magnitude. And so one over x to the R is getting smaller and smaller and magnitude and heading towards zero. Notice that this is no longer true. if r is less than zero, for example, something like r equals negative two, because one over x to the minus two is really x squared. And the limit as x goes to infinity of x squared is going to be infinity, not zero. In this video, we looked at examples of limits as x goes to infinity, and x goes to minus infinity. And we saw that those limits could be zero. Any other number, infinity, negative infinity, or not exist. This video gives some algebraic techniques for computing the limits at infinity of rational functions. Let's find the limit as x goes to infinity of this rational function. The numerator and the denominator of this rational function are each getting arbitrarily large as x goes to infinity. One way to see this is by estimating the graphs, the graph of the numerator looks like a parabola pointing upwards. And the graph of the denominator looks like some kind of cubic. So something like this, for both of these graphs, as x goes to infinity, y also goes to infinity. So this is an infinity over infinity indeterminate form. And just like the zero have over zero indeterminate forms we saw earlier, and infinity over infinity and determinant form could turn out to be absolutely anything. So we're going to use algebra to rewrite this expression in a different form that makes it easier to evaluate. Specifically, we're going to factor out the highest power of x that we can find from the numerator, and then from the denominator. In the numerator, I'm going to factor out the highest power I see in the numerator, which is x squared. When I factor x squared out of 5x squared, I get five, when I factor x squared out of negative 4x, that's like dividing negative 4x by x squared, so I get negative four divided by x. You can check this works by distributing the x squared and making sure we get back to the original expression. Now the highest power of x SC, and the denominator is x cubed. So I'll factor out an x cubed for each from each of those terms, I get a two minus 11 over x plus 12 over x squared. Because factoring out an x cubed is the same as dividing each term by x cubed and then writing the x cubed on the side. Now, we can rewrite again by canceling an x squared from the top and the bottom to get the limit of one over x times five minus four over x over two minus 11 over x plus 12 over x squared. Now as x goes to infinity, four over x goes to zero, because I'm dividing for by larger and larger numbers. Similarly 11 over x goes to zero, and 12 over x squared goes to zero. So I end up with one over x, which is itself going to zero times something that's going to five halves. So my limit is going to be zero times five halves, which is just zero. I've actually been applying limit laws to do these last steps, which is fine, because my component limits exist as finite numbers. Something that wasn't true from my original expression when I had infinity over infinity. In this example, we're asked to find the limit as x goes to negative infinity of a different rational expression. I encourage you to stop the video and try it for yourself first. In this example, the highest power of x in the numerator is x cubed, and the highest power in the denominator is also x cubed. Factoring out the x cubed from the numerator, we get x cubed times three plus six over x plus 10 over x squared, plus two over x cubed. And factoring out the x cubed from the denominator, we get x cubed times two, plus one over X plus five over x cubed. Now the x cubes cancel, and all these parts go to zero. So when the dust clears here, our limit is just three halves. In this next example, the highest power in the numerator is x to the fourth, and the highest power in the denominator is x squared. So we factor out the x to the fourth from the numerator and the x squared from the denominator and cancel as much as we can. A lot of these pieces are going to zero. So our limit is the same as the limit of x squared times one over negative five. As x goes to negative infinity, x squared is positive and goes towards positive infinity. multiplying by negative fifth turns it negative, but doesn't change the fact that the magnitudes are getting arbitrarily large. Therefore, our final limit is negative infinity. Now let's look at the same three examples again, more informally, using a heuristic to get the same conclusions. In the first example, the term 5x squared dominates the numerator, because x squared is much larger than x when x is large. In the denominator, the highest power of x to x cubed dominates, because x cubed is much larger than x squared, or x when x is large. If we ignore all the other terms in the numerator and denominator, and just focus on the important terms, which have the highest powers, then we can rewrite our limit as the limit of 5x squared over 2x cubed, which is the same as the limit as x goes to infinity of five over 2x, just by canceling Xs, which is zero as x goes to infinity. Similarly, if we just focus on the highest power terms in the numerator and denominator in the second example, we get the limit of 3x cubed over 2x cubed, which simplifies to the limit of three halves, which is just three halves. In the third example, the highest power terms are x to the fourth and negative 5x squared. And we rewrite the limit using only these highest power terms and simplify, and we get the limit as x goes to negative infinity of x squared over negative five, which is negative infinity as before, for rational functions, in general, looking at the highest power terms, lets you reliably predict the limits that infinity and negative infinity when the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, then the limit as x goes to infinity, or negative infinity, is zero. As an example, one above, when the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, then the limit is just the quotient of the highest power terms, which is how we got three halves as the limit in the second example. And finally, if the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, then the limit is going to be plus or minus infinity. Like it was in the third example. These shortcut rules are really handy. But it's important to also understand the technique of factoring out highest power terms. Since this technique can be used more generally. This video gave two methods for computing limits and infinity of rational functions. First, there's the formal method of factoring out highest power terms and simplifying. Second, there's the informal method of looking at the degree of the numerator and the degree of the denominator, and focusing on the highest power terms. In the past, you may have heard an informal definition of continuity. Something like a function is continuous, if you can draw it without ever picking up your pencil. In this video, we'll develop a more precise definition of continuity based on limits. It can be helpful to look at some examples of functions that are discontinuous, that is functions that fail to be continuous. In order to better understand what it means to be continuous. Please pause this video and try to draw graphs of at least two different functions that fail to be continuous in different ways. One common kind of discontinuity is called a jump discontinuity. A function has a jump discontinuity, if its graph separates the two pieces with a jump in between them. This particular function can be described as a piecewise defined function with two linear equations, f of x equals to x when x is less than or equal to one, and f of x equals negative x plus two, when x is greater than one. Another common kind of discontinuity is called a removable discontinuity. You may have encountered these before, when you learned about rational functions with holes in them, for example, the function f of x equals x minus three squared times x minus four divided by x minus four, which has a hole when x equals four, and otherwise looks like the graph of x minus three squared. This kind of discontinuity is called removable, because you could get rid of it by plugging the hole just by defining F to have an appropriate value when x equals four. So in this case, you'd want f of x to be the same when x is not equal to four, but you'd want it to have the value of one when x equals four. And that would amount to plugging the hole and making it continuous. In this original example, our function had a removable discontinuity because it wasn't defined when x equals four. But a function could also have a removable discontinuity, because it's defined in the wrong place at x equals four, for example, too high or too low, to fit the trend of f. a discontinuity can also occur at a vertical asymptote, where it's called an infinite discontinuity. For example, the rational function g of x is one over x minus two has an infinite discontinuity at x equals two. Occasionally, you may encounter a discontinuity is that don't look like any of these. For example, the graph of the function y equals cosine of one over X has a wild discontinuity at x equals zero, because of the wild oscillating behavior there. So for a function to be continuous at x equals a, we need it to avoid all of these problems. To avoid a jump discontinuity, we can insist that the functions limit has to exist at x equals a way to avoid a hole or removable discontinuity, we can insist that F has to be defined at x equals A to avoid the other kind of removable discontinuity in which f of a is defined, but it's in the wrong place. We can insist that the limit of f of x as x goes to a has to equal f of a. Sometimes the definition of continuity is written with just the third condition, and the first two conditions are implied. Notice that these three conditions not only exclude jump this continuity and removal this continuity is they also exclude infinite discontinuities and wild discontinuities. For example, in our third example, the function can't be continuous at x equals two, because it fails to have a limit at x equals two and it fails to have a value at x equals two. In our wild, this continuity example, the limit also fails to exist at x equals zero, so the function can't be continuous there. So what are the places where this function f is not in us and why, please take a moment to think about it for yourself. The functions not continuous at negative three, because the function is simply not defined there, the functions not continuous at x equals one, because of that jump discontinuity. In the language of limits, we say that the limit of f of x does not exist, when x equals two, the limit of the function exists and equals three, but the value of the function is down here at negative one. So the function is not continuous, because the limit doesn't equal the value at x equals three, the function is not continuous, because once again, the limit doesn't exist. Notice that x equals negative two. Even though the function turns a corner, the function still continuous. Because the limit exists and equals two, and the value of the function is also two. The function drawn here is not continuous at x equals negative two, because the limit doesn't exist at x equals negative two, the limit from the left is one, while the limit from the right is zero. But it is true that the value of the function at x equals negative two is equal to the limit of the function from the left side. That is, f of negative two is equal to the limit as x goes to negative two from the left of f of x. Notice that we can't say the same thing about the right limit. The limit from the right is zero, while the value of the function is one, and those are equal. In this situation, we say that f is continuous from the left, but not from the right. By the same reasoning at x equals one, the function is not continuous, but it is continuous from the right, because the limit from the right is equal to the value of the function. Notice that f is not continuous from the left here, because the limit from the left is about one and a half, while the value of the function is one. In general, we say that a function f is continuous from the left at x equals j. If the limit as x goes to a from the left of f of x is equal to f of a, and a function is continuous from the right at x equals a. If the limit as x goes to a from the right of f of x equals f of a, in practical terms of function is continuous from the left if the endpoint is included on the left piece, and a function is continuous from the right, if the endpoint is included on the right piece. This video gave a precise definition of continuity at a point in terms of limits. Namely, a function is continuous at the point x equals a. If the limit as x goes to a of the function is equal to the functions value at A. In a previous video, we gave a definition for continuity at a point. In this video, we'll discuss continuity on an interval and continuous functions. We say that a function f of x is continuous on the open interval BC, if f of x is continuous at every point in that interval. For x to be continuous on a closed interval BC, we require it to be continuous on every point in the interior of BC, but we just require it to be continuous from the right at B. And from the left at sea. We can also talk about f being continuous on half open intervals. For example, on half open interval, BC, which is open at B and closed at sea, or the other way around, or the happy to open it all from B to infinity and so on. In all of these cases, we require F to be continuous on the interior of the interval, and left or right continuous on the closed endpoints of the interval as appropriate. So on what intervals is this function geovax continuous? Well, it's continuous. On this part, the arrows indicate it keeps on going. So I'd say it's continuous from negative infinity to negative one, not including the endpoint negative one. It's also continuous here, and we can include the endpoint this time. So this is from negative one to one and Then again, on this last section, we can't include one. It's not continuous there. It's not even defined there. So what kinds of functions are continuous? What kinds of functions are continuous everywhere? And by everywhere, I mean, on the entire real line negative infinity infinity? Well, polynomials are a great example. Also, sine x and cosine x, the absolute value of x is another common example. There are certainly many other functions that are continuous on the whole real line. I'll let you see if you can come up with some more examples. Now, if we ask the second question, what kinds of functions are continuous on their domains, we get a lot more answers, not only polynomials, but also all rational functions, things like f of x equals 5x minus two over x minus three squared times x plus four is a good example of a rational function, even though it's not continuous everywhere. Because it's not continuous when x equals three or negative four, it is continuous on its whole domain, because three and four are not in the domain of this rational function. In addition, all trig functions, inverse trig functions, log and either the x functions. And pretty much all the functions we normally encounter are continuous on their domains, although their domains are not necessarily the whole real line. For example, for natural log of x, the domain is just zero, infinity, and that's where the function is continuous. In addition, the sums, differences, products and quotients of continuous functions are continuous on their domains, so for example, y equals sine of x plus the natural log of x is continuous where it's defined, the compositions of continuous functions are continuous on their domains. So for example, the function y equals ln of sine of x is continuous, where defined turns out to be a bunch of disjoint intervals where sine is positive. Since continuity is defined in terms of limits, it's sometimes possible to use our knowledge of which functions are continuous to calculate limits. For example, if we want to find the limit as x goes to zero of cosine of x, because cosine is continuous, we can evaluate this limit just by plugging in zero for x. And cosine of zero is one. We're using the definition of continuity here to say that the limit of the function is equal to the value of the function. The second example is a little trickier, because the function inside is not continuous at x equals two. In fact, it's not defined at x equals two. But as X approaches 2x squared minus four over 2x minus four times pi, can be rewritten as x plus two times x minus two over two times x minus two times pi, which is the same thing as x plus two over two pi. For x not equal to two. So as X approaches two, this expression here, approaches two plus two over two times pi, which is just two pi. In other words, the limit as x goes to two of x squared minus four over 2x minus four pi is just two pi. And therefore, the limit as x goes to two of cosine of this expression is just cosine of two pi, which is again equal to one. We're using here the fact that cosine is continuous, and a property of continuous functions, which says that the limit as x goes to a of f of g of x is equal to f of the limit as x goes to a of g of x. If f is a continuous function. In other words, for continuous functions, you can pass the limit inside the function. That's all for continuity on intervals and continuous functions. The intermediate value theorem says that if f is a continuous function, on the closed interval a b and if n is any number, in between F of A and F of Bay, n f has to achieve that value and somewhere. In other words, if n is a number between F of A and F of b, then there has to be a number c in the interval a, b, such that f of c equals n. In our example, there are three such possible values for C, it could be right here, since f of that number equals n, or it could be here, or here, I'll just mark the middle one. The intermediate value theorem can only be applied to continuous functions. If the function is not continuous, then it might jump over and, and never achieve that value. When application of the intermediate value theorem is to prove the existence of roots or zeros of equations, we call that a real root of p of x is a real number c, such that P of C is zero, we're going to want to apply the intermediate value theorem with n equal to zero. Our polynomial is defined on the whole real line, not just an interval. But the trick here is to pick an interval a b, so that P of A is negative, and P of B is positive, or vice versa. So that the intermediate value theorem will tell us that P has to pass through zero in between. I'm just going to use trial and error here and calculate a few values of p. So P of zero is easy to calculate, P of zero is just seven. P of one is going to be five minus three minus 12 plus seven, which equals negative three. So in this very lucky example, the first two numbers that we pick will work for our A and B, so we can just let A be equal 01. Because P of zero is a positive number, and P of one is a negative number. So actually, the graph should look a little different. The graph looks more like this. But in any case, by the intermediate value theorem, there has to be a number c, in between, in this case, zero and one, where our polynomial p achieves this intermediate value of zero. And that number See, we don't know what it is, but we know it somewhere in the interval zero to one, that value c gives us a real root for our polynomial. There may be other real roots, but we've proved there exists at least one. The intermediate value theorem has lots of other applications besides finding roots. For example, suppose you have a wall that runs in a circle around the castle, and the height of the wall varies continuously as a function of the angle. Surprisingly, the intermediate value theorem can be used to show there must be somewhere two diametrically opposite places on the wall with exactly the same height. So if you can figure out a way to show this in this video, we stated the intermediate value theorem, which holds for continuous functions, and talked about a couple of applications. This video introduces the trig functions, sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent. For right triangles. For a right triangle with sides of length A, B and C angle theta as drawn, we define sine of theta as the length of the opposite side over the hypothesis. The side that's opposite to our angle theta has measure a and I have partners is this side here with measure C. So that would be a oversee for this triangle. Cosine of theta is defined as the length of the adjacent side over the length of high partners. This side here is the side adjacent to theta. Of course, the high partners is also adjacent to theta, but it's special as the high partners so we don't think of it as the adjacent side. So that would be B oversea. tangent of theta is the opposite side length over the adjacent side length. So that would be a over b. The pneumonic to remember this is so A toa. That's sine is opposite over hypotenuse. Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. And tangent is opposite over adjacent. In fact, there's a relationship between tangent and sine and cosine. Namely, tangent of theta is equal to sine of theta over cosine of theta. If you want to see why that's, that's because sine of theta over cosine of theta is given by sine, which is opposite over hypotenuse, divided by cosine, which is adjacent over hypotenuse. If we compute these fractions by flipping and multiplying, the high partners, length cancels, and we just get opposite over adjacent, which is by definition, tangent of theta. There are three more trig functions that are defined in terms of sine, cosine and tangent. First of all, their sequence of theta, by definition, that's one over cosine of theta. So it's going to be one over the adjacent over hypotenuse, which is the high partners over the adjacent, which in this triangle is C over B. cosecant of theta is defined as one over sine theta. So that's one over the opposite over the hypotenuse, which is the high partners over the opposite. And for this triangle, that's going to be C over a. Finally, cotangent of theta is defined as one over tan theta, that's going to be one over opposite over adjacent, flip and multiply, I get adjacent over opposite birth, which in this case is b over a. So notice that the values for cotangent cosecant and secant are the reciprocals of the values for tangent, sine and cosine, respectively. Let's use these definitions to find the exact values of all six trig functions for the angle theta in this triangle. I'll start with sine of theta. That's the opposite of our hypothesis. Well, for this angle theta, the opposite side is down here, and as measured to the high partners has measured five. So sine theta is two over five. Cosine theta is adjacent over hypotenuse, but I don't know the value of this side length. But fortunately, I can find it using the Fagor in theorem says I have a right triangle here, I know that a squared, I'll call this side length A plus B squared, where b is this other leg of the triangle is equal to c squared, where c is the hypothesis. So here I have a squared plus two squared equals five squared, which means that a squared plus four equals 25. A squared is 21. So A is plus or minus the square root of 21. But since I'm talking about the length of a side of a triangle, I can just use the positive answer. Returning to my computation of cosine theta, I can write it as adjacent, which is the square root of 21. Over hypotony News, which is five, tangent theta is the opposite over the adjacent, so that's going to be two over the square root of 21. To compute secant of theta, that's one over cosine theta, so that's going to be one over square root of 21 over five, which is five over the square root of 21. The reciprocal of my cosine value. cosecant theta is one over sine theta, that's going to be the reciprocal of my sine, so five halves, and cotangent theta is one over a tan theta, so it's going to be the reciprocal of my 10 value square root of 21 over two. Finally, we'll do an application. So if we have a kite that's flying at an angle of elevation as the angle from the horizontal bar of 75 degrees with a kite length string of 100 meters, we want to find out how high it is. I'll call the height Why? Well, we want to relate the known quantities this angle and this hypothesis to The unknown quantity, the unknown quantity is the opposite side of our triangle. So if we use sine of theta equals opposite of our hypothesis, then we can relate these known amounts sine of 75 degrees to our unknown amount y, which is the opposite and are known amount of 100 meters. solving for y, this gives that y is 100 meters times sine of 75 degrees, we can use a calculator to compute sine of 75 degrees, be sure you use degree mode and not radian mode, when you type in the 75. When I do the computation, I get a final answer of 96.59 meters up to two decimal places. Notice that we're ignoring the height of the person in this problem. To remember the definitions of the trig functions, you can use the pneumonic, so tau, and the fact that secant is the reciprocal of cosine cosecant the reciprocal of sine and cotangent the reciprocal of tangent. In this video, I'll use geometry to compute the sine and cosine of a 30 degree angle, a 45 degree angle and a 60 degree angle. One way to compute the sine of a 45 degree angle is to use a right triangle with a 45 degree angle. This particular right triangle has I have partners of length one. Since all the angles of the triangle have to add up to 180 degrees, and we already have 90 degrees and 45 degrees, the remaining angle must also be 45 degrees. So we have an isosceles triangle with two sides the same length, I'll call that side length a. If we want sine of 45 degrees, let's use this 45 degree angle here, then sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So if I can figure out how long this side length is, I'll be able to compute sine of 45 degrees. Now the Pythagorean theorem says this side length squared plus that side land squared equals I have hotness squared. So we have that a squared plus a squared equals one squared. All right, that is two A squared equals one. So a squared is one half, and a is plus or minus the square root of one half. Since we're talking about the length of sides of triangles, I can just use the positive square root it's customary to rewrite this as the square root of one over the square root of two, which is one over the square root of two, and then rationalize the denominator by multiplying the top and the bottom by the square root of two. That gives me a square root of two in the numerator, and the square root of two squared in the denominator, which is the square root of two over two. So the side lengths are the square root of two over two. Now I can figure out the sine of 45 degrees, by computing the opposite over the hypotenuse. That's, I'm looking at this angle. So opposite is square root of two over two hypothesis one. So the sine of 45 degrees is the square root of two over two. Cosine of 45 degrees is adjacent over hypotenuse. That's this side length over this hypothesis. So that's the square root of two over two over one again, what would happen if instead of using this triangle with hypotony is one, we use this triangle, also a 4545 90 triangle with hypotony is five, not quite drawn to scale. Please pause the video for a moment and repeat the computation with this triangle. This time, I'll call the side length B. Pythagoras theorem tells me b squared plus b squared equals five squared. So two, b squared equals 25. And b squared equals 25 over two, B is going to be the plus or minus the square root of 25 over two again, I can just use the positive version. And so B is the square root of 25 over the square root of two, which is five over the square root of two, rationalizing the denominator, I get five root two over two. Now, sine of my 45 degree angle is opposite overhype hotness, which is five square root of two over two divided by five. That simplifies to the square root of two over two as before, and a similar computation shows that cosine of 45 degrees is also square root of two over two as before. This makes sense because sine and cosine are based on ratios of sides. And since these two triangles are similar triangles, they'll have the same ratios of sides. To find the sine and cosine of 30 degrees, let's use this 30 6090 right triangle with hypotony is one. If we double the triangle, we get an angle of 30 here, so a total angle of 60 degrees here, and this angle is also 60 degrees. So we have a 60 6060 triangle, that's an equilateral triangle, all side lengths are the same. Since this side length has length one, this side length is also one. This entire side length is one, which means this short side of our original triangle has length one half. Going back to my original triangle, let's use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of its longer side x. But agrin theorem says x squared plus one half squared equals one squared. So x squared plus a fourth equals 1x squared is three fourths. And so x is plus or minus the square root of three fourths is the positive version, and get the square root of three over the square root of four, which is the square root of three over two. Now using our original triangle, again, let's compute the sine of this 30 degree angle here. We know that sine of 30 degrees is opposite of our hypothesis, the opposite of this angle is one half and the hypothesis is one. So we get a sine of one half over one, which is one half cosine of 30 degrees is adjacent over hypothesis. So that's the square root of three over two divided by one. To find sine of 60 degrees and cosine of 60 degrees, we can actually use this same green triangle and just focus on this upper corner angle of 60 degrees instead. So sine of 60 degrees. Opposite overhype hotness, but this time the opposite to this angle is the square root of three over two. Cosine of 60 degrees adjacent over hypotenuse gives us one half. I'll summarize the results in this table below. Notice that a 30 degree angle corresponds to pi over six radians since 30 degrees times pi over 180 is pi over six. Similarly, 45 degrees corresponds to pi over four radians and 60 degrees corresponds to pi over three radians. I recommend that you memorize the three numbers one half, root two over two, and root three over two. And the fact that one half and root three over two go together. And root two over two goes with itself. From that information, it's not hard to reconstruct the triangles, you know that a 4545 90 triangle is my sauciest triangle. So it must have the side lengths were the same number goes with itself. And a 30 6090 triangle has one side length smaller than the other. So the smaller side must be one half and the larger side must be root three over two since root three is bigger than one and so root three over two is bigger than one half. Doing a visual check, you can easily fill in the angles, the smaller angle must be the 30 degree angle, and the larger one must be the 60 degree one. In this video, we computed the sine and cosine of three special angles 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees. This video defined sine and cosine in terms of points on the unit circle. a unit circle is a circle with radius one. Up to now we defined sine and cosine and tangent in terms of right triangles. For example, to find sine of 14 degrees in theory, you could draw a right triangle with an angle of 14 degrees and then calculate the sign as the length of the opposite side over the length of pi partners. But if we use this method to try to compute sine of 120 degrees, things go horribly wrong. When we draw this 120 degree angle, and this right angle, there's no way to complete this picture to get a right triangle. So instead, we're going to use a unit circle, that is a circle of radius one. The figure below illustrates how right triangles and a unit circle are related. If you draw right triangles, with larger of hypotenuse one with larger and larger angles, then the top vertex sweeps out part of a unit circle. Let's look at this relationship in more detail. In this figure, I've drawn a right triangle inside a unit circle, the high partners of the triangle is the radius of the circle, which is one, one vertex of the right triangle is at the origin, another vertex of the right triangle is at the edge of the circle, I'm going to call the coordinates of that vertex A, B. Now the base of this right triangle has length a, the x coordinate, and the height of the right triangle is B, the y coordinate. If I use the right triangle definition of sine and cosine of theta, this right here is the angle theta, then cosine of theta is adjacent over hypotenuse, so that's a over one, or a. Notice that a also represents the x coordinate of this point on the unit circle. At angle theta from the x axis. I'll write that down. For sine of theta, if I use the right triangle definition, that's opposite overhead partners, so B over one, which is just B. But B also represents the y coordinate of this point in the on the unit circle at angle theta. For tangent theta, if we use the right side triangle definition, its opposite over adjacent. So that's B over A, I can think of that as the y coordinate of the point over the x coordinate of the point. Now for angles theta, that can't be part of a right triangle, because they're too big, they're bigger than 90 degrees, like now I'll call this angle here theta, I can still use this idea of x and y coordinates to calculate the sine and cosine of theta. So if I just mark this point, on the end of this line at angle theta, if I mark that to have coordinates x and y, then cosine theta, I'm still going to define as the x coordinate of this point, sine theta as the y coordinate, and tangent theta as the ratio of the y coordinate over the x coordinate. When we use this unit circle definition, we always draw theta starting from the positive x axis and going counterclockwise. Let's use this unit circle definition to calculate sine, cosine and tangent of this angle fee. In our figure, we have a unit circle. And these numbers are supposed to represent the x&y coordinates of this point on the unit circle at the endpoint of this line segment, that lies at angle fee for the positive x axis. Sign fee is equal to the y coordinate cosine fee is equal to the x coordinate. And tangent of fee is given by the ratio of the two, which works out to negative 0.3639 up to four decimal places. This video gives a method for calculating sine cosine and tangent in terms of the unit circle. Starting from the positive x axis, you draw the angle theta going counterclockwise. You look at the coordinates of the point on the circle where that angle ends. And the cosine of that angle theta is the x coordinate, sine of theta is the y coordinate, and tangent of theta is the ratio. This video gives three properties of the trig function sine and cosine that can be deduced from the unit circle definition. Recall that the unit circle definition of sine and cosine for angle theta is that cosine theta is the x coordinate. And sine of theta is the y coordinate for the point on the unit circle at angle theta. The first property is what I call the periodic property. This says that the values of cosine and sine are periodic with period two pi. And what that means is that if you take cosine of an angle plus two pi, you get the same thing as just if you took cosine of the angle. So when we write this down, we're assuming that theta is measured in radians. If we want to measure theta in degrees, the similar statement is that cosine of theta plus 360 degrees is equal to cosine of theta, we can make the same statements for sine, sine of an angle plus two pi is equal to sine of the original angle, here, the angle being measured in radians. If we want to measure the angle in degrees, the statement is that sine of theta plus 360 is equal to sine of theta, we can see why this is true from the unit circle definition of sine and cosine. This is our angle theta, then theta plus two pi, the plus two pi adds a full turn around the unit circle to our angle, so we end up at the same place, theta and theta plus two pi are just two different names for the same location on the unit circle. And since sine and cosine give you the y and x coordinates of that point on the unit circle, they have to have the same value. Similarly, if we consider an angle theta, and an angle theta minus two pi, the minus two pi means we go the other direction around the unit circle clockwise, we still end up in the same place. And therefore, cosine of theta minus two pi, the x coordinate of that position is the same thing as cosine of theta, sine of theta minus two pi is the same thing as sine of theta, the same statements hold if we add or subtract multiples of two pi. For example, cosine of theta plus four pi is still the same thing as cosine of theta. This time, we've just gone to turns around the unit circle and still gotten back to the same place. So if we want to find cosine of five Pi, that's the same thing as cosine of pi plus four pi, which is the same thing as cosine of pi. Thinking about the unit circle, pi is halfway around the unit circle. So cosine of pi means the x coordinate of this point right here. Well, that point has coordinates negative one, zero, so cosine of pi must be negative one. If I want to take sine of negative 420 degrees, well, that's sine of negative 360 degrees, minus 60 degrees, which is the same thing as sine of minus 60 degrees. Thinking about the unit circle, minus 60 degrees, means I start at the positive x axis and go clockwise by 60 degrees that lands me about right here. And so that's one of the special angles that has an x coordinate of one half a y coordinate of negative root three over two. And therefore sine of negative 60 is negative root three over two the y coordinate. The next property I call the even odd property, it says that cosine is an even function, which means that cosine of negative theta is the same thing as cosine of theta, while sine is an odd function, which means that sine of negative theta is the negative of sine of theta. To see why this is true, let's look at an angle theta. And the angle negative theta. A negative angle means you go in the clockwise instead of counterclockwise direction from the positive x axis. The coordinates of this point by definition, r cosine theta sine theta, whereas the coordinates of this point are cosine negative theta, sine of negative theta. But by symmetry, these two points have the exact same x coordinate, and therefore cosine of theta must equal cosine of negative theta, while their y coordinates have the same magnitude, but opposite signs. This one's positive and this one's negative. Have, therefore, sine of negative theta is the negative of sine of theta. Let's figure out if tan of theta isn't even or odd function. Well, we know that tan of negative theta, tangent by definition, is sine over cosine. Well, we know that sine of negative theta is the negative of sine of theta, whereas cosine of negative theta is cosine of theta. Therefore, we're getting negative sign theta over cosine theta, which is negative tan of theta. Since tan of negative theta is the negative of tan of theta, tan theta is an odd function. The last property on this video is the Pythagorean property, which says that cosine of theta squared plus sine of theta squared is equal to one. A lot of times this property is written with this shorthand notation, cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one. But this notation, cosine squared theta just means you take cosine of theta and square it. This property is called the Pythagorean property, because it comes from the Pythagorean Theorem. Let me draw a right triangle on the unit circle. I'll call this angle theta. So the coordinates of this endpoint here are cosine theta sine theta. Since this is supposed to be a unit circle, the hypotenuse of my right triangle has length one, the base of my right triangle is just cosine theta, same thing as the x coordinate of this point. And the height of my triangle is the y coordinate of the point sine theta. Now the Pythagorean theorem says that this side length squared plus that so that squared equals one squared, since one squared is the same thing as one, that gives me the Pythagorean property. But tigrayan property is handy for computing values of cosine given values of sine and vice versa. And this problem, we're told that sine of t is negative two sevenths. And T is an angle that lies in quadrant three. When we say the angle lies in quadrant three, that means the terminal side of the angle lies here in quadrant three. One way to find cosine of t is to use the fact that cosine squared t plus sine squared t is equal to one. That is cosine of t squared plus negative 2/7 squared is equal to one, I can write this as cosine of t squared plus 4/49 is equal to one and so cosine of t squared is equal to one minus 4/49, which is 4540 nights. taking the square root of both sides, that goes for the cosine t is plus or minus the square root of 45 over 49, that's plus or minus the square root of 45 over seven. Now since we're in the third quadrant, we know that cosine of t, which represents the x coordinate of this point, must also be negative. Therefore, cosine of t is going to be negative square to 45 over seven. It's also possible to solve this problem using the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles directly. If we look at the fact that sine of t is negative two sevenths and ignore the negative sign for now, we can think of this information as telling us that we have a right triangle angle theta, whose opposite side is two, and whose high partners is seven. We call this side here a them but Tiger in theorem says us a squared plus two squared is seven squared. So a squared plus four is 49. So a squared is 45. And a is plus or minus the square root of 45. Since I'm worrying about a triangle, I'm going to use the positive value. Now, cosine of t is going to be adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's going to be the square root of 45 over seven. Now I go back to thinking about positive and negative signs. And I noticed that since I'm in the third quadrant, my co sign is be negative, so I just stick a negative sign in front. This alternative solution, this is many of the same ideas as the previous solution, and ultimately gets us the same answer. This video gives three properties of trig functions, the periodic property, the even odd property, and the Pythagorean property. This video is about the graphs of sine and cosine. I want to graph the functions y equals cosine t and y equals sine t, where t is in radians, I'm gonna think of this being the t axis, and this being the y axis. One way to do this is to plot points. So I'll fill in this chart, using my knowledge of special angles on the unit circle. These points will be easier to graph, if I convert them all to decimals. Now plot the points for cosine and connect the dots to get a graph of y equals cosine t from t equals zero to t equals two pi. To continue the graph for t values less than zero or bigger than two pi, I could plot more points. Or I could just use the fact that the cosine values repeat. If I add or subtract two pi to the my angle T, I'll be at the same place on the unit circle. So my cosine will be exactly the same. Therefore, my values of cosine, which are represented by my y values on this graph, repeat themselves. For example, when my T value is two pi plus pi over six about like here, it's cosine is the same as the cosine of just pi over six. So I'll take this dot here and repeat it over here. Similarly, the when t is like two pi plus pi over four, I get the same value of cosine is when it's just pi over four. So this.is going to repeat. And I can continue repeating all my dots. This one repeats over here at two pi plus, say pi over three. And so my whole graph will repeat something like this. It also repeats on this side, something like this. Since subtracting two pi from my t values will also give me the same value of cosine. We can also plot points to get a graph for sine and extend it by repetition. Going forward, I'll usually write the function sine and cosine as y equals cosine of x and y equals sine of x. When I read it this way, notice that x now refers to an angle, while y refers to a value of cosine, or sine. That's a different meaning of x and y, compared to when we're talking about the unit circle, where x refers to the cosine value, and y refers to the sine value. Now let's look at some properties of the graphs of sine and cosine. The first thing you might notice is that the graph of cosine and the graph of sine are super similar to each other. In fact, you can think of the graph of cosine as just being the graph of sine shifted to the left by pi over two. So we can write cosine of x as the sine function of x plus pi over two, since adding pi over two on the inside, move the graph horizontally to the left by pi over two. Or we can think of the graph of sine as being constructed from the graph of cosine by shifting the cosine graph right by pi over two, that means we can write sine of x as equal to cosine of x minus pi over two, since subtracting pi over two on the inside, shifts the cosine graph to the right by pi over two. Next, let's look at domain and range. The domain of sine and cosine is all real numbers. All right, that is negative infinity to infinity, but the range is just from negative one to one. That makes sense, because sine and cosine come from the unit circle. The input values for the domain come from angles. And you can use any numbers and angle positive or negative as big as you want, just by wrapping a lot of times around the circle. The output values for the range, that is the actual values of sine and cosine come from the coordinates on the unit circle. And those coordinates can't be any bigger than one or any smaller than negative one. So that gives us a range. As far as even an odd behavior, you can tell from the graph. Here's cosine, that it's symmetric with respect to the y axis and so it must be even. Whereas the graph of sine is symmetric with respect to the origin and must be odd. The absolute maximum value have these two functions is one and the absolute minimum value is negative one. We can also use the words midline amplitude and period to describe these two functions. The midline is the horizontal line, halfway in between the maximum and minimum points. Here, the midline is y equals zero, the amplitude is the vertical distance between a maximum point and the midline. You can also think of the amplitude as the vertical distance between a minimum point and the midline, or as half the vertical distance between a midpoint and a max point. For the cosine function and the sine function, the amplitude is one. A periodic function is a function that repeats at regular horizontal intervals. The horizontal length of the smallest repeating unit is called the period for Y equals cosine of x, the period is two pi. Notice that the period is the horizontal distance between successive peaks, or maximum points, or between successive troughs, or minimum points. algebraically, we can write cosine of x plus two pi equals cosine of x and sine of x plus two pi equals sine of x to indicate that the functions repeat themselves over an interval of two pi and have a period of two pi. In this video, we graphed y equals cosine of x and y equals sine of x. and observe that they both have a midline at y equals zero, an amplitude of one and a period of two pi. sine u sort of functions are functions that are related to sine and cosine by transformations like stretching and shrinking and shifting. This video is about graphing these functions. Let's start by graphing the function, y equals three sine of 2x. This function is related to the function y equals sine x. So I'll graph that first. Now, the three on the outside stretches this graph vertically by a factor of three, while the two on the inside compresses that horizontally by a factor of one half. If instead I want to graph y equals three sine 2x plus one, this plus one on the outside shifts everything up by one unit. Let's compare the midline amplitude and period of our original y equals sine x are transformed y equals three sine 2x. And our further transformed y equals three sine 2x plus one, the original sine has a midline at y equals zero, an amplitude of one and a period of two pi. For the transformed function, y equals three times sine of 2x. The two on the inside shrinks everything horizontally by a factor of one half. So it changes the period of two pi into a period of one half times two pi, which is pi. Since the two on the inside only affects x values and horizontal distances, it doesn't affect the midline, which is a y value, or the amplitude, which is a vertical distance. But the three on the outside does affect these things. Well, in particular, it affects the amplitude, since everything is stretched out vertically by a factor of three, the amplitude of one get stretch to an amplitude of three. In this case, the midline doesn't actually change, because multiplying a y value of zero by three is still a y value of zero. Now on the third function, we've taken the second function and added one on the outside, so that shifts everything up by one. Therefore, instead of having a midline at y equals zero, we now have a midline at y equals one. The amplitude doesn't change though it's still three because shifting everything up by one doesn't affect the distance between the mid mind and the end the maximum point. Also, the period is still pi since the period is a horizontal measure, and adding one on the outside only affects vertical things. Now next, let's graph the function y equals three times sine of two times quantity x minus pi over four. This function is very closely related to the First function we graphed on the previous page, that was y equals three sine of 2x. In fact, if we give the name f of x to that function, and maybe we can call g of x, this other function, then we can get g of x by taking f of x and plugging in x minus pi over four in for x. In other words, g of x is f of x minus pi over four. This relationship gives me an idea for graphing g of x, the function we want to graph, we can first graph f of x, we already did that on the previous page. And then we can shift its graph to the right by pi over four, because that's what you do when you subtract a number on the inside of a function. So here's the graph of y equals three sine 2x. Recall that it's just the graph of sine stretched vertically by a factor of three, and shrunk horizontally by a factor of one half. Now, to graph the function that I want, I'm going to shift this graph over by pi over four to the right. Notice that since I had my function written in factored form, I could just read off the horizontal shift. But if I had written it instead, as y equals three sine 2x minus pi over two, which is algebraically equivalent, it would be easy to get confused and think that I needed to shift over by pi over two. So it's best to factor first, before figuring out what the shift is, we're factoring out the coefficient of x. If instead, we wanted to graph this function, same as the one we just graphed, it's just with a minus one on the outside, that minus one would just bring everything down by one. Let's take a moment to look at midline amplitude, and period for the original parent function, y equals sine of x, and our final transformed function, y equals three sine of two times quantity x minus pi over four minus one, our original sine function has midline at y equals zero amplitude of one and period of two pi. For our transform function, the three on the outside stretches vertically, so it makes the amplitude three. The minus one on the outside shifts everything down by one. So it brings the midline, y equals zero, down to Y equals negative one, the two on the inside, shrinks everything horizontally by a factor of one half. So the period becomes one half times two pi, which is pi. Finally, there's a horizontal shift going on our transformed function shifts to the right, by pi over four, this horizontal shift is sometimes called the phase shift. The function we just analyzed was y equals three sine 2x minus pi over four minus one, which could also be written as y equals three sine 2x minus pi over two minus one. This is a function of the form y equals a sine B x minus c plus d, where b is positive. If we have a function of this form, or the similar function with cosine in it, then we know that the midline is going to be at y equals D. That's because the original midline of sine or cosine at y equals zero gets shifted up by D, we know that the amplitude is going to be a because this A multiplied on the outside stretches everything vertically by a factor of A. to be a little more accurate, we should say the amplitude is the absolute value of A in case a is negative. If a is negative, then that amounts to a vertical reflection or a reflection over the x axis. We know that the period of the original sine or cosine is two pi. And we know that this factor of B amounts to a horizontal shrink by a factor of one over B or I guess it could be a horizontal stretch by a factor of one over b If b is less than one, so because we're starting with a period of two pi, and we're multiplying by one over B, our new period is going to be two Pi over B. The trickiest thing is the horizontal shift. And to get that right, I like to factor out this B for my equation. So instead of writing y equals a cosine bx minus c plus d, I'm going to write y equals A cosine B times quantity x minus c over b plus d. Similarly, if it's a sine function, I write y equals a sine B times x minus quantity c over b plus d, then I can read off the horizontal shift as C over B. And that'll be a shift to the right, if C over B is positive and a shift to the left, if C over b is negative, this might seem backwards from what you're used to, but it's because we have that minus sign there. So if C over B is positive, we're actually subtracting on the inside. So that shifts right, if C of b over b is negative minus a negative is actually adding something, and that's why it shifts it to the left. So as one final example, say I wanted to graph y equals 1/3, cosine of one half x plus three minus five, that would have a midline at y equals minus five, an amplitude of 1/3, a period of two pi divided by one half, which is four pi, and a horizontal shift. Better rewrite this horizontal shift of six units to the left, the horizontal shift is sometimes called the phase shift. And that's all for graphs of sinusoidal functions. This video is about graphing the trig functions, tangent, secant, cotangent and cosecant. To gain an intuition for the graph of y equals tangent of x, I think it's handy to look at the slope of a line at angle theta on the unit circle. The slope of this line is the rise over the run. But the rise is given by sine of theta, and the run is given by cosine of theta. So the slope is given by sine theta over cosine theta, which is simply tan of theta. So if I want to graph y equals tan of x, I can think of x as being the angle and y as being the slope of the line at that angle. Notice if the angle is zero, the slope is zero. But as the angle increases towards pi over two, the slope gets bigger and bigger heading towards infinity. As the angle goes from zero towards negative pi over two, the slope is getting negative and heading towards negative infinity at exactly pi over two and negative pi over two, we have a vertical line. And so the slope is undefined. Using this information, let's graph a rough sketch of y equals tan x. Remember, we're thinking of x as the angle and y as the slope, we're going to go between an angle of negative pi over two and pi over two. So we said that the slope was zero when the angle is zero, and then it heads up towards positive infinity as we go towards the angle goes towards pi over two with an undefined value at pi over two, it goes negative heading towards negative infinity as the angle heads towards negative pi over two, also with an undefined value at negative pi over two. You can also verify that for angles slightly bigger than pi over two, we have the same line as for angles that are approaching negative pi over two, and therefore this picture repeats and it turns out that tangent is periodic With period not to pi, like sine and cosine, but just pi, the period of pi makes sense because if you take a line and rotate it by 180 degrees, it's the same line with the same slope, and therefore has the same value of tangents. In this graph of y equals 10x, notice that the x intercepts, all right values of x have the form negative two pi, negative pi, zero, pi, two pi, etc, you can write that as pi times k, where k is an integer, that is a positive or negative whole number or zero. This makes a lot of sense because tangent of x is sine of x over cosine of x. And so you're going to get x intercepts, that's where y is zero, which is where the numerator is zero, and sine x is zero, at values of the form pi, two pi, and so on. From the graph, you can see the vertical asymptotes are at values like negative three pi over two, negative pi over two, pi over two, and three pi over two, these values can be written as pi over two times k, where k is an odd integer. Again, this makes sense from the definition of tangents since vertical asymptotes, will occur where the denominator is zero, and cosine x is zero, at numbers, like negative pi over two pi over two, three pi over two, and so on, the domain of tangent is the x axis for which it's defined. So that's going to be everything except for the vertical asymptotes, we can write that as x such that x is not equal to pi over two times k, for K, an odd integer. The range or the y values go all the way from negative infinity to infinity. And the period, as we mentioned previously, is pi. Since the smallest repeating unit has a horizontal width of pi, to graph y equals secant x, I'm going to remember that secant is one over cosine. So if I start with a graph of cosine, I can take the reciprocal of the y values to get the graph of secant, the reciprocal of one is one, the reciprocal of zero is undefined, so I'm not going to have a value at pi over two, negative pi over two, three pi over two, or negative three pi over two. When I take the reciprocal of numbers, just less than one, I'm going to get numbers just greater than one, but I would take the reciprocal of positive numbers getting close to zero, I'm going to get really big positive numbers going up towards infinity. Similarly, on the other side, over here, I have numbers close to zero, but negative, so their reciprocals will be negative numbers heading towards negative infinity. The reciprocal of negative one is negative one. And similarly here, so I'm getting kind of positive and negative buckets and upside down buckets as the graph of my sequence. Notice that secant has a period of two pi, which makes sense, since cosine has a period of two pi, it has a range that goes from negative infinity to negative one inclusive, and from one to infinity. That makes sense because the range of cosine is between one and negative one, and we're taking the reciprocal of those values. The domain is everything except for the vertical asymptotes. Now the vertical asymptotes are where cosine is zero. So that is at values of the form pi over two, three pi over two, etc. That's values of the form pi over 2k, where k is an odd integer. So the domain is going to be x values such that x is not equal to pi over 2k. For K and odd integer. The x intercepts of secant Well, it doesn't have any, because you can't take one over something and get the numbers zero for your y value. We've seen the graph of y equals Tana x and y equals secant x. This is the graph of y equals cotangent x. It looks similar to the graph of tangent x, it's just a decreasing function instead of an increasing one, and it has its vertical asymptotes. And it's x intercepts in different places. Finally, this green graph is the graph of y equals cosecant x. It's related to the graph of sine x, since cosecant is one over sine x, and in fact, if I draw the graph of sine x in between, you can see how it kind of bounces off. Because it's the reciprocal. I encourage you to memorize the general shape of these graphs, you can always figure out the details by thinking how about how they're related to the graphs of cosine of x, and sine x. This video is an introduction to solving trig equations. Let's start with the equation two cosine x plus one equals zero, I want to find all the solutions in the interval from zero to two pi, and then get a general formula for all solutions, not just those in that interval. Let me start by rewriting this equation to isolate the tricky part, which is cosine of x. So I'm going to write to cosine x equals negative one, and then divide both sides by two. Now I'm looking for the angles x between zero and two pi, whose cosine is negative one half. Since negative one half is one of the special values on the unit circle, I can use my knowledge of the unit circle, to see that the angle between zero and two pi must be either two pi over three, or four pi over three, my answer needs to include both of these values. There are no other spots on the unit circle whose cosine is negative one half. But there are more angles, because we can always take one of these angles and add multiples of two pi to it. So if I want to find all solutions, I can take these two principles solutions, two pi over three, and four pi over three, and simply add multiples of two pi to them. For example, two pi over three plus two pi, or two pi over three minus two pi, two pi over three plus four pi, and so on. A much more efficient way to write this is to write two pi over three plus two pi times k, any integer that is any positive or negative whole number or zero. Similarly, I can write four pi over three plus two pi k, to capture all solutions, based on the principal solution for pi over three by adding and subtracting multiples of two pi. This is my final solution. Next, let's look at a tricky equation involving tangent. As usual, I'm going to start out by cleaning things up and isolating the tricky part, which in this case is tangent. So let me add tangent to both sides. That'll give me three, tan x equals the square root of three. And so tan x is the square root of three over three. The square root of three over three looks suspiciously similar to value the value of square to three over two, which is a special value on my unit circle. So my suspicion is that my unit circle will again help me find this value of x without a calculator. Recall that tan x is sine x over cosine x. So I'm looking for angles on the unit circle between zero and two pi with a ratio of sine over cosine will give me square root of three over three, I actually only need to look in the first quadrant and the third quadrant, because those are the quadrants where a tangent is positive. And I really only need to look at angles whose either sine or cosine has a squared of three in it. So by trial and error, I can see that tan pi over six, which is sine pi over six over cosine pi over six will give me one half over root three over two That's the same thing as one half times two over three, which is one over root three. If I rationalize that, I get root three over three, so that value works. If I try tan of pi over three, instead, I get root three, which is not equal to root three over three. So pi over three doesn't work. Similarly, I can work out some the values in the third quadrant, and see that seven pi over six works. But four pi over three does not. So my answer to part A includes just the two values, pi over six, and seven pi over six. Now if I want to find all solutions, not just those in the interval from zero to two pi, I noticed that I can take one of these principal solutions, and add multiples of two pi to it, because that'll give me the same angle. So I get pi over six plus two pi k, and pi over six, sorry, seven pi over six plus two pi, K, any integer. This is a correct answer. But it's not as simple as it could be. Notice that seven pi over six over here on the unit circle is exactly pi more than pi over six. So instead of taking both of these and adding multiples of two pi to them, I could get all the same answers by just taking one of them and adding multiples of pi to it. So a more efficient answer is to say that x equals pi over six, plus pi times k, for K any integer. This will still capture all the same solutions. Because when k is even, I'll get this family solutions. And when k is odd, I'll get this family. For example, when k is one, pi over six plus one times pi is just the original seven pi over six. If you think about the fact that tangent has a period of pi, instead of two pi, it makes a lot of sense that you should be able to write the solutions in this form. In this video, we solved basic trig equations by first isolating sine, or tangent, or the same thing would work with cosine. And then using the unit circle, to find principal solutions. Principal solutions are just solutions between zero and two pi. And then adding multiples of two pi to these principal solutions to get all solutions. For tangent, we noticed that it was equivalent to just use one principal solution and add multiples of pi instead of two pi. In this video, we'll introduce the idea of the derivative using graphs, secant lines and tangent lines. So I have a function here, drawn in black, the function is y equals f of x. But actually here f of x equals x squared. I also have a tangent line to my function drawn in red. This tangent line is the tangent line at the point 1.5 2.25. By a tangent line, I mean a line that touches the graph of my function at this one point, and heads off in the same direction as the function. Well, normally to compute the slope, we need two points. But for the tangent line, we really only have the exact coordinates of this one point, we could approximate the slope by guessing the coordinates of some other points on the red line. But in the long run, we'll end up with a more accurate estimate if we do something else. So what we're going to do instead is we're going to calculate the slope of a secant line. A secant line is a line that goes through two points on my graph. So in this case, my secant line is going through my original point, and this other point at x equals three. So that's the point three, three squared or three nine. Okay, so here's my secant line. To calculate the slope of my secant line, I use the fact that slope is rise over run. Or in other words, it's the change in y over the change in x. And that's going to be written in function notation. F of three minus f of 1.5 is giving me the change in y and three minus one point gives me the change in x. Wilson's f of x is x squared, this is the same thing as three squared minus 1.5 squared over three minus 1.5. So that's just nine minus 2.25, over 1.5, which ends up as 4.5. So 4.5 is the slope of this second line. Well, the idea here is that the slope of my secant line is an approximation of the slope of my tangent line. But in this example, really the secant line that I've used, it's, its slope is only a very rough approximation of the tangent line, not very accurate, all. So how could I get a better approximation of the slope of my tangent line? Well, one thing I could do is I could use as my second point, instead of using this point way out here, I could use a point closer to my first point. So for example, I could use the point two, f of two. In other words, the point two, four, as my second point for my second line, so let me draw that. And let me calculate its slope, which after some arithmetic is going to give me an answer of 3.5. Well, I could continue to pick second points for my secant line, closer and closer to my first point. And I should end up with more and more accurate approximations of my tangent line, let me make a little chart for this. For my next secant line, I could take my second point, something pretty close to 1.5, say 1.6. And after some arithmetic, I get a slope of 3.1. To take my second point to be 1.51, that's going to give me a slope of 3.01, and so on. To write this more generally, if I take my second point as x, then the slope of my secant line is going to be given by again the rise over the run. So that's going to be f of x minus f of 1.5 divided by x minus 1.5. Change in y over the change in x, that's my slope. Now, there's no reason I necessarily have to take my second point to be on the right side of my first point, I could be using stead points on the left side here. Continue with my chart, letting my second point be one, I can do the same computations to get a slope of a secant line of 2.5. Here, I could get even closer on the left, say something like 1.4 and get a slope of 2.9, and so on. In general, if I have a point x f of x, and I use a secant line through that point in our original point, I calculate the slope as change in y over change in x, which is going to be f of 1.5 minus f of x divided by 1.5 minus x. Actually, I can rewrite this a little bit to make it look more like the expression up here. If I multiply the numerator and denominator by negative one, then I can rewrite this as f of x minus f of 1.5 divided by x minus 1.5. So that these two expressions look exactly the same. So the only difference here on my mind is that over here, I was thinking of x as being a little bit bigger than 1.5. And here I'm thinking of x as being a little smaller than 1.5. But I get the exact same expression for the slope of the secant line either way. Now, this process of picking points closer and closer to our original point from the left, and from the right, should remind you of limits. And indeed, the slope of the tangent line is the limit as x goes to 1.5 of the slope of my secant lines, which are given by this expression. This quantity is so important that's given its own name, it's called the derivative of f of x at x equals 1.5. So in other words, the derivative which is written as f prime at 1.5, is the limit as x goes to 1.5 of f of x minus f of 1.5 over x minus 1.5. Now based on our numerical tables, for example, here, we can see that that limit seems to be heading towards three, whether X approaches 1.5, from the right or from the left. So I'll write down the answer of three. You know, it's pretty strong. If you wanted to have a really precise argument. We'd actually need to use algebra to compute this limit. Exactly using the formula for the function itself, f of x equals x squared. And we'll do examples like that in a future video. But for now, the main point is just that the slope of the tangent line is the limit of the slope of the secant lines, which is given by this formula. For now, let's look at an animation that shows how the slope of our secant lines approach the slope of our tangent line. So this black curve here is the function y equals x squared. The red line is the tangent line through the point where x equals 1.5. And the blue line is a secant line that goes through the point with x coordinate 1.5. And a second point with x coordinate 2.5. The points are shown here on the right. So I'm going to use this slider here and drag my second point closer to my first point. So notice how as the x coordinate, my second point gets closer and closer to 1.5. My secant line is getting closer and closer to my tangent line. So the slope of my tangent line really is the limit of the slope of my secant lines, as my x coordinate of my second point goes to 1.5. So this is true, even if I start with my second point on the left instead of the right, as I drag that second point closer and closer to the first point, the slope of my secant lines gets closer and closer to the slope of that red tangent line. We saw in our example, that the slope of our tangent line, or the derivative at 1.5, was given by the limit as x goes to 1.5 of f of x minus f of 1.5 divided by x minus 1.5. Well, in general, the derivative of a function y equals f of x at an x value a is given by f prime of A equals the limit as x goes to a of f of x minus F of A over x minus a, the function is said to be differentiable at A. If this limit exists. In particular, both the limit from the left and a limit from the right have to exist and be equal for the function to be differentiable at x equals a. There's another equivalent version of the definition of derivative that's very common and very useful. If we're looking at the graph of a function, I'm trying to calculate the slope of the secant line between the points A, F of A and x f of x, then let's introduce the letter H to be the quantity x minus a. So h represents the run, when I'm calculating the slope of this secant line, I can write H equals x minus a, or equivalently x equals a plus H. And so I can rewrite the definition of derivative in terms of H as f prime of A equals the limit as x goes to a of f of a plus h minus F of A divided by h, just by substituting in this expression for x. And h for x minus a. Well as x goes to a, x minus a is going to zero. In other words, h is going to zero. So this is equivalent to the limit as h goes to zero of f of a plus h minus f of a over h. One way to think of this is that we're just relabeling this point right here, as the point A plus h, f of a plus H. And the slope of the tangent line is still the limit of the rise over the run as the run goes to zero, this is the definition of derivative that we'll use most frequently going forward when we actually calculate derivatives based on the definition in future videos. But for now, let's look at some examples to practice recognizing the derivative rather than computing it. So each of these following two expressions are supposed to represent the derivative of some function at some value a. So for each example, we're supposed to find the function and figure out the value of A. Now remember, we've got two definitions of derivative going on. They're both equivalent, but they look different. One of them looks like derivative of f at a is the limit as x goes to a of f of x minus F of A over x minus a. And the other version is the limit as h goes to zero of f of a plus h minus f of a over h. Now, you might notice That our first expression looks more like this first definition, because x is going to some number that's not zero. And we have both x and a number in the denominator here. Whereas our second expression looks more like the second definition, we've got the age going to zero, and we've just got the age on the denominator here. Okay, so let's look at this first one here. First, let's figure out what A is here. It seems like a has got to be negative one. Since x is approaching negative one. That kind of makes sense, because now here on the denominator, x plus one could be thought of as x minus negative one. So that's our x minus a with a is negative one. Okay, great. So we've got a, now we need to find an F. And we will need the numerator here to look like f of x minus f of a, well, let's try the simplest thing, we can, let's try f of x equals x plus five squared, then X plus five squared is our f of x. and f of a is our f of negative one is going to be negative one plus five squared, which is 16. So that matches up perfectly, we've got our f of x here, our f of a here, and our x minus a at the bottom. That's exactly the definition of derivative done the first one. All right, now the second one. Now, again, we need to figure out what a is. And we need to find figure out what f is. This part of the expression here is supposed to be f of a plus h. So I'm going to guess, make a guess here, that f of x should be three to some power, let's just try three to the X and see how that works. Now we need this nine to be f of a. So nine has to be three to the A. And the only way that can work is if a is two. So continuing on the top, we need f of a plus h, that is f of two plus h, two B three to the two plus H and that actually works perfectly. If our f of x is three to the x, it's all falling into place. So we've got our f of two plus h, r f of two, and r h. And it all works where f of x being three to the x and a being two. In this video, we introduced the idea of derivative as a slope of a tangent line. And we gave two equivalent definitions of the derivative in terms of limits. We'll continue with some interpretations of derivatives in the next video. This video is algebraically intensive, and is concerned with calculating derivatives using the limit definition of derivative. Well, there are actually two versions of the limit definition of derivative. And I'll mostly use this one, the limit as h goes to zero of f of a plus h minus f of a over h. If you're interested, you can try reworking the problems using the alternative definition of derivative. The limit as x goes to a of f of x minus F of A over x minus a first example, find the derivative of f of x, which is one over the square root of three minus x at x equals negative one. Well, in other words, we want to find f prime of negative one. So that's the limit as h goes to zero of f of negative one plus h minus f of negative one over h. Using our definition of f, that's the limit of one over the square root of three minus negative one plus h minus one over the square root of three minus negative one, all over h. Let me clean this up a bit. So this is one over the square root of, let's see, it's three minus negative one, so that's three plus one, or four minus h minus one over the square root of four over h. And I guess I can replace the square root of four with two. Now, unfortunately, I can't just evaluate this by plugging in H equals zero, because if I try that, I get one of these zero over zero indeterminate forms. You'll run across these a lot when calculating derivatives by definition, it kind of makes sense because remember the context where computing slopes of secant lines as these points get closer and closer together. So our rise and our runs are both going to zero. So it makes sense, we'll get these zero or zero indeterminate forms, we have to use our algebraic tricks that we learned before, for rewriting our expression in a way that we can calculate the limit. And I see two things going on here, there's square roots lurking, and there's also fractions. So it's anybody's guess which trick I might want to apply First, the trick for square roots, which would be multiplying the top and the bottom by the conjugate. And the trick for fractions, which would be adding together my fraction for the common denominator. I guess I'll try my fraction trick first. So my common denominator for my two fractions here, is just the product of these two denominators. So that's the square root of four minus h times two. Let me rewrite my fractions with this common denominator. Continuing here, I get the limit of two minus the square root of four minus h over squared, a four minus h times two, all over h. instead of dividing by H, let me multiply by one over h. And let's see here, let's see if we can evaluate by plugging in H equals zero at this stage. Unfortunately, when I try to plug in, I'm still getting the zero of zero indeterminate form. But I'm not out of tricks, I haven't used the conjugate trick yet. So let's try multiplying the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the top. Once I multiply out here, I'll get four plus two square to four minus h minus two square to four minus h, minus the square root of four minus h squared, that's going to cancel out nicely. And on the bottom, I have two h squared of four minus h times two plus square to four minus h, I'll leave that factored for now. That's good thing, I have unlimited space here, I'm kind of need it. Now on the numerator, I'm going to get four minus four minus h, is carrying the denominator along for the ride now, oh, I see something good. I see in the numerator, we're getting a four minus four plus H. Subtracting out those fours to zero, and then cancelling out, my H is that divide by each other, I think I finally got something that I can evaluate without getting a zero over zero indeterminate form. All right, so here we've got. So as h goes to zero, I'm just going to get one over two times the square root of four times two plus a squared of four, which equals 1/16. So by now, you may have forgotten what the original problem was, I think I have it, let's go back up here, we were looking for the derivative of f of x, which was one over a squared of three minus x at x equals negative one, we set up the limit definition, did a bunch of algebra first adding together fractions, then using the conjugate trick, and eventually found that that derivative equaled 1/16. The algebra doesn't get much harder than this problem here. In this next example, we're asked to find the equation of the tangent line to y equals x cubed minus 3x at x equals two. So the slope of the tangent line is given by the derivative, f prime of two. So let's calculate the derivative first. f prime of two is the limit as h goes to zero of f of two plus h minus f of two, all over h. So that's the limit of two plus h cubed minus three times two plus h minus two cubed minus three times two. I'm just plugging in first two plus h for x in the definition of my function, and then I'm plugging in two for x. Now all of that needs to be over h. Once again, if I try to plug in zero for H in these expressions, I'm just gonna get something that all cancels out to zero at the top, and also have zero at the bottom, one of my classic zero over zero indeterminate forms. So instead, I need to use algebra to simplify things. And hope I can calculate the limit after that. So a good trick for simplifying here is to multiply out two plus h cubed multiplies out to two cubed, plus three times two squared times h, plus three times two times h squared plus h cubed. I'm getting this from the formula for multiplying out of cubic which I've memorized. But you can also get it more slowly just by writing out two plus h times itself three times and, and distributing. Now I need to subtract three times two, and three times h. And finally, I needed to subtract my two cubed and then add my three times to all this over h. Now if you have my terms cancel out to zero here, two cubed minus two cubed. And let's see I've got a minus three times two and a plus three times two. And I notice all the terms that are left have H's and so I'm going to factor out an H from the top from the remaining terms here. And that gives me let's say, three times two squared, so that's 12, plus six H, plus h squared minus three over h. Now, h divided by h is one. So I'm just left with the limit as h goes to zero of 12 plus six h plus h squared minus three, as h goes to zero, I can just plug in H zero, and I get 12 minus three, which is nine. So my slope of my tangent line, my derivative is nine. I'm not quite done, I still need to find the equation of the tangent line, I just know that its slope is nine. So the equation of the tangent line equation of any line is something like y equals mx plus b. and here m is nine. So I have y equals 9x plus b, I just need to find the intercept B. Now, usually, to find the intercept, I need a plug in a point. what point do I have here to plug in? Well, remember, we're talking about a tangent line here. So we've got the point of tangency, the point where x equals two, and the corresponding y value is y equals two cubed minus three times two, or two. So my tangent line has to go through the point to two, which means if I plug in this point for x and y, I get two equals nine times two plus b, which means that B has to equal negative 16. So the equation of my tangent line then becomes y equals 9x minus 16. I found that by first calculating the derivative to get my slope, and then using the point of tangency, plugging in the x value to get the y value, and plugging Matt in to get b to finish off the equation. So in this video, we used our tricks for evaluating limits algebraically to compute some derivatives, using the definition of derivative. This is pretty labor intensive. So fortunately, pretty soon, we'll learn some shortcut methods for calculating derivatives without resorting to the definition. We've seen that the derivative of a function y equals f of x at a point, x equals A represents the slope of a tangent line through the point A f of a. But if the function f of x represents some practical quantity, like distance as a function of time, or fuel efficiency as a function of speed, then the derivative will also have a practical interpretation. This video is about interpreting the derivative in different contexts. One of the most famous contexts for interpreting derivatives is problems involving motion. So let's say I'm on a bike ride, heading straight north from campus. And let's suppose that y equals f of x represents my distance from campus. So x is the time and hours and y or f of x is my distance and miles, the distance away from campus. Distance north of campus. It's kind of fun to see what this graph here means in terms of my bike ride. In particular, what's going on up here, where my y values reach their maximum. And what about here, where my function is constant. Please pause the video for a moment and see if you can make up a story that fits the graph. So here at the top, my distance is no longer increasing, it's actually starting to decrease. So I must have turned around and be heading back towards campus again, over here, where my f of x is constant, I probably stopped at a coffee shop to take a rest or maybe I'm fixing a flat tire. Now let's get to the questions at hand. Consider these two points, three, f of three, and four F of four, we want to interpret the slope of the secant line through those two points. Slope is change in y over change in x. And y here is distance and x here is time. So change in distance over change in time. Sounds a lot like speed, or more accurately, velocity. Velocity just means speed in a certain direction, and is positive. If distance is increasing, and negative if it's decreasing. Speed is the absolute value of velocity, and there's always positive or zero. So in our case, the velocity here must be negative, because our distance is decreasing. And we could estimate it very roughly as about, say four minus 12 over four minus three, so about negative eight miles per hour. But what is this negative eight miles per hour refer to. Since we're looking at the change in distance, over this entire hour long interval, the slope of my secant line gives my average velocity over this interval. It doesn't give my exact velocity, and exactly three hours or exactly four hours, only my average velocity. If I want to know my exact velocity at exactly three hours, I need to look instead at the slope of the tangent line at x equals three. The velocity at an exact instant of time is sometimes called the instantaneous velocity to distinguish it from the average velocity over a time interval. Let's think for a minute about why the velocity at exactly three hours is given by the slope of the tangent line. We saw in a previous video that the slope of the tangent line is the limit of the slope of the secant lines More precisely, the limit as x goes to three of f of x minus f of three over x minus three. Wow, well, each of these ratios represents an average velocity on the interval from three to x. And so the limit is the limit of average velocities on tinier and tinier intervals of time, one minute, one second 100th of a second, in the limit, as the length of the time interval goes to zero, we're going to get the exact velocity at exactly three hours. So to repeat, in this example, the slope of the secant line represents the average velocity over time interval, and the derivative at x equals three, written f prime of three, which is also the slope of the tangent line, that derivative represents the instantaneous velocity at x equals three. More generally, if f of x represents any quantity that's changing, then the slope of the secant line represents an average rate of change. While the slope of the tangent line, f prime of a represents an instantaneous rate of change. Let's see how that works in a couple of other examples. Let's suppose that f of x represents the temperature of a cup of coffee and degrees Fahrenheit as a function of time and minutes since he said it on the counter. So let's interpret the first equation. f of zero is 140. Well, that just means that at time zero, the temperature is 140 degrees. What about the equation f of 10 minus f of zero is negative 20. That's saying that the temperature goes down by 20 degrees as x the time goes from zero to 10 minutes. Now, what about this quotient here being equal to negative two? Well, this quotient looks a lot like the slope of a secant Why, right, so it must be an average rate of change. And in this context, we have the temperature is decreasing by an average of two degrees per minute, as x changes from zero to 10 minutes. Finally, the derivative of f at 15 is negative point five means that at exactly 15 minutes, the temperature is decreasing at a rate of point five degrees per minute. negative numbers here always mean decreasing, and f prime is an instantaneous rate of change. Let's look at another example. Please pause the video and try this one for yourself. Here g of x represents the fuel efficiency of a Toyota Prius and mpg as a function of x, the speed in miles per hour that is traveling g of 45 is 52 means that at 45 miles per hour, the fuel efficiency is 52 miles per gallon. The second statement is saying that as speed increases from 35 to 45 miles per hour, fuel efficiency goes up by 10. That's 10 miles per gallon. The third statement says that the average rate of change of fuel efficiency is two miles per gallon per mile per hour, as speed increases from 35 to 40 miles per hour. So going up from 35 to 40, gives you better fuel efficiency here. On the other hand, when you're going 60 miles per hour, your fuel efficiency is decreasing at a rate of two miles per gallon per mile per hour. So I bet the optimal fuel efficiency here occurs somewhere between 40 and 60 miles per hour. In this video, we've interpreted the slope of the secant line as the average rate of change, and the slope of the tangent line with the derivative as an instantaneous rate of change. I hope that these general principles will help you interpret the derivative in a variety of contexts that you might encounter throughout your life. In this video, we'll think of the derivative of a function as being a function in itself, we relate the graph of a function to the graph of its derivative, and we'll talk about where the derivative does not exist. We've seen that for a function f of x and a number A, the derivative of f of x at x equals A is given by this formula. But what if we let a very, if we compute f prime of a lots of different values of a, we can think of the derivative of f prime as itself being a function, I'm going to rewrite this definition of derivative with x in the place of a just to make it look a little more like standard function notation. So f prime as a function of x is the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h minus f of x over h. This isn't anything substantially different from what we've been doing before, it's just a difference in perspective. So let's do one more example of computing the derivative by hand using the definition, but a general number x instead of a specific value, the function we're going to use is f of x equals one over x. And first, let's just write down the definition of derivative in general. So f prime of x is given by this formula. And using the fact that f of x is one over x, I can rewrite this as one over x plus h minus one over x all over h. So as usual, this is a zero over zero indeterminate form. If I plug in zero for H, I'm just going to get one over x minus one over x on the numerator, which is zero. and plugging in zero for H gives me zero on the denominator two. So I'll need to use some algebra to rewrite things to get an A form that I can evaluate it. Let's add together our fractions in the numerator here. The common denominator I need to use is x plus h times x. So I multiply this fraction by x over x and the next fraction by x plus h over x plus h. All that's over h. And now continuing, I get x minus x plus h over x plus h times X and instead of dividing the whole thing by h here, multiply by one over h to get the limit have x minus x minus h over x plus h times x times h. Now I can subtract off my x's here. And after I do that, I can divide my minus h by my H, to get just a minus one on the numerator here. So that's just the limit of negative one over x plus h times x. And now I'm in a good position because I can plug in H equals zero and get something that makes sense. Namely, I'm getting a limit of negative one over x plus zero times x or negative one over x squared as my derivative. In this example, we're given the graph of a function that's supposed to represent the height of an alien spaceship above the Earth's surface, we want to graph the rate of change. The rate of change means the derivative of our function, but we're not given an equation to work with. So we'll just have to estimate the derivative based on the shape of the graph by thinking about slopes of tangent lines. I'll start by drawing a new set of axes where I can graph my derivative. And I'll consider my original function, which I'll call g of x, piece by piece. For x values between zero and two, my original function g of x looks like a line, it has slope negative one, since the rise is negative two, while the run is two, for any point on the straight line segment, the tangent line will also be a straight line with slope negative one, and therefore, the derivative will be negative one. For x values between zero and two, I'm going to ignore the time being what happens when x is exactly zero or exactly two, and just look at the interval of X values between two and three. Here, g of x is completely flat. So tangent lines at any of these points will have slope zero. And I'll draw a derivative of zero. When x is between two and three, I'll postpone worrying about the derivative when x is exactly three. And just think about the derivative when x is between three and five, where g of x is flat again, so it's tangent lines will have slopes of zero. And I'll draw again, a derivative is zero when x is between three and five. Now things get a little more interesting. As x increases from five to about seven, g of x is an increasing function. The slope of tangent lines here are positive, starting at about, say, a slope of three, and decreasing to a slope of zero, when x is seven, I can draw that down here. As x increases from seven, the tangent lines now have negative slopes, going to a maximum negative slope of about negative one here, and then heading towards a slope of zero, when x is just shy of 10. My estimates of three and negative one for the slopes of my tangent lines are just rough estimates based on approximating the rise over the run. As x increases from 10, the tangent line slope is positive, and getting steeper and steeper, so my derivative is going to be positive and increasing. That's the basic shape of the derivative. Now let's see what happens at these special points like 235 and zero. To figure out the derivative at x equals two, let's go back to the definition of derivative as the limit of the slopes of the secant lines. If I draw a secant line, using a point on the left, I'll just get this line that lines up with this line and has a slope of negative one. But if I compute the slope of a secant line, using a point on the right, I'll get a slope of zero. So the limit from the left and the limit from the right of the slopes of my secret lines will be different. And so my limit does not exist and my derivative does not exist. And so I'll just draw this as an open circle at x equals two. Next, let's look at the derivative when x equals three. Remember that the derivative at three is the limit as h goes to zero, of g of three plus h minus g of three over eight. Well, if H is bigger than zero, then g of three plus H is going to be about a half, because three plus H is to the right of three. On the other hand, if H is less than zero, g of three, plus H is two, because three plus H is actually a number less than three, g of three itself is equal to one half, based on the filled in bubble here. so if we calculate the limit, as h goes to zero from the positive side, we get the limit of one half minus one half over age, which is just the limit of zeros, so that's zero. On the other hand, if we compute the limit from the left, we get the limit of two minus a half over eight, which is the limit of three halves over h. And as h goes to zero, that limit is negative infinity. So once again, the left limit and write limit are not equal. And so the limit of the slopes of the secant lines does not exist, and there's no derivative at x equals three. And I'll draw an open circle there to add x equals five, again, we have a corner. And by the same sort of argument, we can conclude that the derivative does not exist. And finally, when x equals zero, we can only have a limit from the right not the left. And so by that sort of technical reason, we don't have a derivative at that left endpoint either. So we've drawn a rough graph of the rate of change of the height of our alien spaceship, as it comes closer to Earth beams down to pick up Earthlings and then makes us escape up to the mothership. It's interesting to observe that the domain of the original function g of x is from zero to infinity, but the domain of g prime is somewhat smaller, and just goes from zero to two, then from two to three, then from three to five, and finally, from five to infinity, missing some places where the function originally existed. We saw in the previous example, that the derivative doesn't necessarily exist at all the x values where the original function exists. Please pause the video for a moment and try to come up with as many different ways as you can, that a derivative can fail to exist at an x value x equals a. Well, one kind of boring way that a function can fail to have a derivative at x equals A is if f of x itself fails to exist. at x equals a, for example, if it has a hole, like in this picture, we saw in the previous example, with the alien spacecraft, that a derivative can fail to exist when the function turns a corner. When we tried to evaluate the derivative in that example, by taking the limit of the slope of the secant lines, the limit from the left, and a limit from the right did not agree. A famous example of a function that turns a corner is the absolute value function. For the absolute value function, f prime of x is negative one, since the slope here is negative one, when x is less than zero, and it's positive one when x is greater than zero, but f prime of zero itself does not exist. A function with a casp also fails to have a derivative at the cusp. In the alien spaceship example, we also saw that F can fail to have a derivative at a discontinuity. But there's another way that a derivative can fail to exist, even when f has no cost per corner discontinuity. Let's look at the function f of x equals x to the 1/3 graphed here, what's going on at x equals zero. At that instant, the tangent line is a vertical with a slope that's infinite or undefined. So the limit of the slopes of the secant lines will fail to exist because it'll be infinite. A function is called differentiable at x equals a, if the derivative exists at a function is differentiable on an open interval, if f is differentiable at every point in that interval. So all of the examples on the previous slides are examples of places where a function is not differentiable. All of these examples are important. But I'm going to focus on the example involving discontinuity. In general, if f of x is not continuous at x equals a, then f is not differentiable at x equals a. This is what we saw in the example involving the jump discontinuity. an equivalent way of saying the same thing is that f is differentiable at x equals a, then f has to be continuous at x previous slides are examples of places where a function is not differentiable. All of these examples are important. But I'm going to focus on the example involving discontinuity. In general, if f of x is not continuous at x equals a, then f is not differentiable at x equals a. This is what we saw in the example involving the jump discontinuity. an equivalent way of saying the same thing is that f is differentiable at x equals a, then f has to be continuous at x equals a. equals a. However, if all we know is that f is continuous at x equals a, then we can't conclude anything about whether or not is differentiable there, f may or may not be differentiable at x equals a. Remember the square root example, the square root of x is continuous at x equals zero, but it's not differentiable there because of the corner. In this video, we related the graph of a function to the graph of its derivative. By thinking about the slopes of tangent lines, we also looked at several ways that a derivative can fail to exist at a point and noted that if a function is differentiable, it has to be continuous. This video gives a proof that differentiable functions are continuous. What we want to show here is that if a function is differentiable at a number x equals a, then it's continuous at x equals a. Let me call the function f of x. And I'm going to start out by writing down what it means for f of x to be differentiable at x equals a. That means that the limit as x goes to a of f of x minus F of A over x minus a exists and equals this finite number that we call f prime However, if all we know is that f is continuous at x equals a, then we can't conclude anything about whether or not is differentiable there, f may or may not be differentiable at x equals a. Remember the square root example, the square root of x is continuous at x equals zero, but it's not differentiable there because of the corner. In this video, we related the graph of a function to the graph of its derivative. By thinking about the slopes of tangent lines, we also looked at several ways that a derivative can fail to exist at a point and noted that if a function is differentiable, it has to be continuous. This video gives a proof that differentiable functions are continuous. What we want to show here is that if a function is differentiable at a number x equals a, then it's continuous at x equals a. Let me call the function f of x. And I'm going to start out by writing down what it means for f of x to be differentiable at x equals a. That means that the limit as x goes to a of f of x minus F of A over x minus a exists and equals this finite number that we call f prime of a. Now I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation of a. Now I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation by the limit as x goes to a of x minus a. Now wait a second, before I go any further on to make sure this is legit. Does this limit actually exist? Well, yeah, because the limit as x goes to a of x exists, that's just a, and the limit as x goes to a of a exists, that's a also. So the limit of the difference has to exist. And actually, that limit of the difference is the difference of the limits, which is just going to be a minus a or a zero. So I've actually just multiplied both sides by zero and a fancy form. by the limit as x goes to a of x minus a. Now wait a second, before I go any further on to make sure this is legit. Does this limit actually exist? Well, yeah, because the limit as x goes to a of x exists, that's just a, and the limit as x goes to a of a exists, that's a also. So the limit of the difference has to exist. And actually, that limit of the difference is the difference of the limits, which is just going to be a minus a or a zero. So I've actually just multiplied both sides by zero and a fancy form. This is actually a surprisingly useful thing to do. Because I have a product of a limit of two limits here, both of which exist. So by the product rule for limits, I can rewrite this as the limit as x goes to a This is actually a surprisingly useful thing to do. Because I have a product of a limit of two limits here, both of which exist. So by the product rule for limits, I can rewrite this as the limit as x goes to a of x minus a times f of x minus F of A over x minus a. And canceling these two copies of x minus a, which is fine to do when x is near a, just not when x equals a, I get that the limit of f of x minus f of a is equal to this limit over here. Well, we said this limit was just zero. So my limit on the left is equal to zero. of x minus a times f of x minus F of A over x minus a. And canceling these two copies of x minus a, which is fine to do when x is near a, just not when x equals a, I get that the limit of f of x minus f of a is equal to this limit over here. Well, we said this limit was just zero. So my limit on the left is equal to zero. And now I'm so close, I'd like to apply five the limit rule to this difference to break it up into a difference of limits, but I can't quite do that, because I'm not sure yet that the limit, as x goes to a of f of x exists, that's sort of part of what I'm trying to prove as far as continuity. So instead, I think I'm gonna add to both sides, a limit that I do know exists. And that's the limit And now I'm so close, I'd like to apply five the limit rule to this difference to break it up into a difference of limits, but I can't quite do that, because I'm not sure yet that the limit, as x goes to a of f of x exists, that's sort of part of what I'm trying to prove as far as continuity. So instead, I think I'm gonna add to both sides, a limit that I do know exists. And that's the limit of f of a. of f of a. Now, I do know that both of these two limits on the left side exists, so I can use the limit rule about sums to rewrite this limit. Now, I do know that both of these two limits on the left side exists, so I can use the limit rule about sums to rewrite this limit. Now, on the left side, I can cancel out my copies of f of a, whatever number that is, and I get that the limit as x goes to a of f of x which has to exist by the the limit rule for psalms that I applied Now, on the left side, I can cancel out my copies of f of a, whatever number that is, and I get that the limit as x goes to a of f of x which has to exist by the the limit rule for psalms that I applied above. above. That limit their past to equal the limit as x goes to a of f of a, well, f of a is just some number, doesn't matter what X is doing f of a is it's just f of a, whatever that is. So this limit on the right is just f of a, and look at that. That's exactly what it means for a function to be continuous at x equals a, the limit as x goes to a of f of x equals f of a. So f is continuous at x equals a, hella proof is complete. In this video, we prove that if f is differentiable at x equals a, then f is continuous at x equals a. This statement is equivalent to another statement known in logic as its contrapositive, which says that if f is not continuous, at x equals a, then f is not differentiable at x equals a. In this video, we'll learn a few rules for calculating derivatives, namely, the power role, and the derivatives of sums, differences and constant multiples. These rules will give us shortcuts for finding derivatives quickly, without needing to resort to the old limit definition of derivative. In this video, we'll only do statements of the rules and some examples, there won't be any proofs or justification for why the rules hold. Instead, these proofs will be in a separate later video. Let's start with some basics. First of all, if we have a constant C, and we will have the function f of x equals C. So if I graph that, it's just going to be a straight horizontal line. That limit their past to equal the limit as x goes to a of f of a, well, f of a is just some number, doesn't matter what X is doing f of a is it's just f of a, whatever that is. So this limit on the right is just f of a, and look at that. That's exactly what it means for a function to be continuous at x equals a, the limit as x goes to a of f of x equals f of a. So f is continuous at x equals a, hella proof is complete. In this video, we prove that if f is differentiable at x equals a, then f is continuous at x equals a. This statement is equivalent to another statement known in logic as its contrapositive, which says that if f is not continuous, at x equals a, then f is not differentiable at x equals a. In this video, we'll learn a few rules for calculating derivatives, namely, the power role, and the derivatives of sums, differences and constant multiples. These rules will give us shortcuts for finding derivatives quickly, without needing to resort to the old limit definition of derivative. In this video, we'll only do statements of the rules and some examples, there won't be any proofs or justification for why the rules hold. Instead, these proofs will be in a separate later video. Let's start with some basics. First of all, if we have a constant C, and we will have the function f of x equals C. So if I graph that, it's just going to be a straight horizontal line. So the derivative So the derivative df dx, ought to be zero, because the slope of the tangent line of this straight line is just df dx, ought to be zero, because the slope of the tangent line of this straight line is just zero. zero. Another simple example, is the derivative of the function f of x equals x. So again, if I draw the graph, that's just going to be a straight line with slope one. And so the tangent line for the straight line will also have slope one. And the derivative, f prime of x has to be always equal to one. These two simple examples are actually special cases of the power rule, which is one of the most useful rules for calculating Another simple example, is the derivative of the function f of x equals x. So again, if I draw the graph, that's just going to be a straight line with slope one. And so the tangent line for the straight line will also have slope one. And the derivative, f prime of x has to be always equal to one. These two simple examples are actually special cases of the power rule, which is one of the most useful rules for calculating derivatives. derivatives. So the power rule says that if you have the function, y equals x to the n, where n is any real number, then you can find the derivative d y dx, simply by pulling that exponent and down and multiplying it in the front and then reducing the exponent by one. So for example, if you want to calculate the derivative of y equals x to the 15th, D y dX here is just going to be 15 times x to the 15 minus one, or 14. The second example, f of x equals the cube root of x might not immediately look like an example where we can apply the power rule. But if we rewrite it, by putting the cube root in exponential tation as x to the 1/3, now we can apply the power rule, we bring the 1/3 down, multiplied on the front and So the power rule says that if you have the function, y equals x to the n, where n is any real number, then you can find the derivative d y dx, simply by pulling that exponent and down and multiplying it in the front and then reducing the exponent by one. So for example, if you want to calculate the derivative of y equals x to the 15th, D y dX here is just going to be 15 times x to the 15 minus one, or 14. The second example, f of x equals the cube root of x might not immediately look like an example where we can apply the power rule. But if we rewrite it, by putting the cube root in exponential tation as x to the 1/3, now we can apply the power rule, we bring the 1/3 down, multiplied on the front and reduce the reduce the exponent of 1/3 by one, or 1/3 minus one is negative two thirds. So we found the derivative here using the power rule, we could rewrite it if we want to using exponent rules, as one over 3x to the two thirds, either answers good. exponent of 1/3 by one, or 1/3 minus one is negative two thirds. So we found the derivative here using the power rule, we could rewrite it if we want to using exponent rules, as one over 3x to the two thirds, either answers good. In the third example, g of x is one over x to the 3.7. Again, we need to do a little rewriting before we can apply the power rule. So I'm going to rewrite g of x as x to the minus 3.7. Using exponent rules, now I can find dg dx by pulling down the negative 3.7 multiplying in the front, and now I have to reduce negative 3.7 by one, so I subtract one that gives me x to the negative 4.7. Again, I can rewrite this if I wish as negative 3.7 over x to the 4.7. It's important to notice that in all these examples and in fact, in any example where the power rule applies, the variable x is in the base. And the exponent is just a constant, just a real number. The constant multiple rules says that if c is just a constant real number, and f is a differentiable function, then the derivative of C times f of x is just c times the derivative of f of x. In other words, when we take the derivative, we can just pull a constant outside of the derivative sign. Let's use this rule in an example. If we want to take the derivative of 5x cubed, that's the same thing as five times the derivative of x cubed. And now using the power rule, we can bring down the three and get 15x squared. f and g are differentiable functions, then the derivative of f of x plus g of x is the derivative of f plus the derivative of g. Similarly, for a difference, if f and g are differentiable functions, then the derivative of the difference is just the difference of the derivatives. Now let's use all these rules together to calculate the derivative of this polynomial. To find the y dx, we can use the sum and difference rule to calculate the derivative of each term separately. Now using the constant multiple rule and the power rule, we can bring out the seven, bring down the three getting x squared here, similarly, for the next term, five times two times x to the one, four times the derivative of x, which is just one, and the derivative of a constant two is just zero. So simplifying, we get 21x squared minus 10x plus four, and notice that the derivative of the original polynomial is just another polynomial of one less degree. In this video, we use some shortcuts to calculate the derivatives of various functions, especially polynomials. If you're interested in seeing where these rules come from, how they're derived from the limit definition of derivative, then look for another video coming soon on proofs. This video is about identities involving trig functions like sine and cosine. But I want to start with some examples that just involve In the third example, g of x is one over x to the 3.7. Again, we need to do a little rewriting before we can apply the power rule. So I'm going to rewrite g of x as x to the minus 3.7. Using exponent rules, now I can find dg dx by pulling down the negative 3.7 multiplying in the front, and now I have to reduce negative 3.7 by one, so I subtract one that gives me x to the negative 4.7. Again, I can rewrite this if I wish as negative 3.7 over x to the 4.7. It's important to notice that in all these examples and in fact, in any example where the power rule applies, the variable x is in the base. And the exponent is just a constant, just a real number. The constant multiple rules says that if c is just a constant real number, and f is a differentiable function, then the derivative of C times f of x is just c times the derivative of f of x. In other words, when we take the derivative, we can just pull a constant outside of the derivative sign. Let's use this rule in an example. If we want to take the derivative of 5x cubed, that's the same thing as five times the derivative of x cubed. And now using the power rule, we can bring down the three and get 15x squared. f and g are differentiable functions, then the derivative of f of x plus g of x is the derivative of f plus the derivative of g. Similarly, for a difference, if f and g are differentiable functions, then the derivative of the difference is just the difference of the derivatives. Now let's use all these rules together to calculate the derivative of this polynomial. To find the y dx, we can use the sum and difference rule to calculate the derivative of each term separately. Now using the constant multiple rule and the power rule, we can bring out the seven, bring down the three getting x squared here, similarly, for the next term, five times two times x to the one, four times the derivative of x, which is just one, and the derivative of a constant two is just zero. So simplifying, we get 21x squared minus 10x plus four, and notice that the derivative of the original polynomial is just another polynomial of one less degree. In this video, we use some shortcuts to calculate the derivatives of various functions, especially polynomials. If you're interested in seeing where these rules come from, how they're derived from the limit definition of derivative, then look for another video coming soon on proofs. This video is about identities involving trig functions like sine and cosine. But I want to start with some examples that just involve quadratic functions. If I want to find the solutions to this equation, I can rewrite it x squared minus 6x minus seven equals zero, factor it, x minus seven times x plus one equals zero, set the factors equal to 0x minus seven equals zero, or x plus one equals zero. And that gives me the solutions, x equals seven, or x equals negative one. Next, let's look at this more complicated equation. I'm going to try to solve that for x by multiplying out the right hand side. Next, our combined terms on the right hand side. So that gives me x squared minus 6x on both sides, well, x squared minus 6x is equal to x squared minus 6x. That's true no matter what I plug in for x, and therefore, all values of x satisfy this equation, we can say that the solution set is all real numbers. The second equation is called an identity, because it holds for all values of the variable. The first equation, on the other hand is not an identity, because it only holds for some values of x and not all values. Please pause the video for a moment and try to decide which of the following three equations or identities that is, which of these equations hold for all values of the variable. To start out, you might want to test them by plugging in a few values of the variable and see if the equation holds. The first equation is not an identity. It does hold for some values of x. For example, if x equals zero, then sine of two times zero is zero. Two times sine of zero is also zero. So it does hold when x is zero. However, when x is say pi over two, then sine of two times pi over two, that's the same thing as sine of pi, which is zero, but two times sine of pi over two, that's two times one, or two, and zero is not equal to two. So the equation does not hold for x equals pi quadratic functions. If I want to find the solutions to this equation, I can rewrite it x squared minus 6x minus seven equals zero, factor it, x minus seven times x plus one equals zero, set the factors equal to 0x minus seven equals zero, or x plus one equals zero. And that gives me the solutions, x equals seven, or x equals negative one. Next, let's look at this more complicated equation. I'm going to try to solve that for x by multiplying out the right hand side. Next, our combined terms on the right hand side. So that gives me x squared minus 6x on both sides, well, x squared minus 6x is equal to x squared minus 6x. That's true no matter what I plug in for x, and therefore, all values of x satisfy this equation, we can say that the solution set is all real numbers. The second equation is called an identity, because it holds for all values of the variable. The first equation, on the other hand is not an identity, because it only holds for some values of x and not all values. Please pause the video for a moment and try to decide which of the following three equations or identities that is, which of these equations hold for all values of the variable. To start out, you might want to test them by plugging in a few values of the variable and see if the equation holds. The first equation is not an identity. It does hold for some values of x. For example, if x equals zero, then sine of two times zero is zero. Two times sine of zero is also zero. So it does hold when x is zero. However, when x is say pi over two, then sine of two times pi over two, that's the same thing as sine of pi, which is zero, but two times sine of pi over two, that's two times one, or two, and zero is not equal to two. So the equation does not hold for x equals pi over two. over two. Since it doesn't hold for all values of the variable, it's not an identity. The second equation is an identity. You can build some evidence for this by plugging in numbers. For example, cosine of zero plus pi, which is negative one is the same thing as negative of cosine of zero. You can also check for example, that cosine of pi over six plus pi is the same thing as negative cosine of pi over six. But even if we check a zillion examples, that's just evidence, it's not a proof that the identity holds, we could have just gotten lucky with the values we picked, we can build a little bit stronger evidence, by looking at graphs, I'm going to put theta on the x axis in a pie graph, y equals cosine of theta plus Since it doesn't hold for all values of the variable, it's not an identity. The second equation is an identity. You can build some evidence for this by plugging in numbers. For example, cosine of zero plus pi, which is negative one is the same thing as negative of cosine of zero. You can also check for example, that cosine of pi over six plus pi is the same thing as negative cosine of pi over six. But even if we check a zillion examples, that's just evidence, it's not a proof that the identity holds, we could have just gotten lucky with the values we picked, we can build a little bit stronger evidence, by looking at graphs, I'm going to put theta on the x axis in a pie graph, y equals cosine of theta plus pi, pi, that's just like the graph of cosine shifted over to the left by pi. On the other hand, if I graph y equals negative cosine theta, that's the graph of cosine theta, reflected across the x axis, which gives us the exact same graph. So graphing both sides gives us strong evidence that this equation is an identity, it holds for all values of theta. Now, the strongest evidence of all would be an algebraic proof, which we'll do later in the course, once we have a formula for the cosine of a sum of two angles. that's just like the graph of cosine shifted over to the left by pi. On the other hand, if I graph y equals negative cosine theta, that's the graph of cosine theta, reflected across the x axis, which gives us the exact same graph. So graphing both sides gives us strong evidence that this equation is an identity, it holds for all values of theta. Now, the strongest evidence of all would be an algebraic proof, which we'll do later in the course, once we have a formula for the cosine of a sum of two angles. In the meantime, let's look at equation C. It turns out equation C is an identity. And we could build evidence for it again by plugging in values for x, or by graphing the left side and the right side separately, and checking to see that the graphs coincided. But for this example, I'm going to go ahead and do an algebraic verification. In the meantime, let's look at equation C. It turns out equation C is an identity. And we could build evidence for it again by plugging in values for x, or by graphing the left side and the right side separately, and checking to see that the graphs coincided. But for this example, I'm going to go ahead and do an algebraic verification. In particular, I'm going to start with the left side of the equation, and rewrite things and rewrite things until I get to the right side of the equation. The first thing I'll rewrite In particular, I'm going to start with the left side of the equation, and rewrite things and rewrite things until I get to the right side of the equation. The first thing I'll rewrite is secant and tangent in terms of their constituent functions, sine and cosine. Since secant of x is one over cosine x, and tangent of x is sine x over cosine x, I can rewrite this expression as one over cosine x minus sine x times sine x over cosine x. I can clean up those fractions and write this as one over cosine x minus sine squared x over cosine x. Now, I noticed that I have two fractions with the same denominator. So I can pull them together as one minus sine squared x over cosine x. Next, I'm going to rewrite the numerator one minus sine squared x using the Pythagorean identity that says that cosine squared x plus sine squared x equals one, and therefore, one minus sine squared x is equal to cosine squared x just by subtracting sine squared x from both sides. So I can replace my numerator, one minus sine squared x with cosine squared x. And canceling one cosine from the top and from the bottom, that's the same thing as cosine of x, which is the right hand side that I was trying to get to. So a combination of a bunch of algebra, and the Pythagorean identity allows me to prove that this equation is true for all values of x, is secant and tangent in terms of their constituent functions, sine and cosine. Since secant of x is one over cosine x, and tangent of x is sine x over cosine x, I can rewrite this expression as one over cosine x minus sine x times sine x over cosine x. I can clean up those fractions and write this as one over cosine x minus sine squared x over cosine x. Now, I noticed that I have two fractions with the same denominator. So I can pull them together as one minus sine squared x over cosine x. Next, I'm going to rewrite the numerator one minus sine squared x using the Pythagorean identity that says that cosine squared x plus sine squared x equals one, and therefore, one minus sine squared x is equal to cosine squared x just by subtracting sine squared x from both sides. So I can replace my numerator, one minus sine squared x with cosine squared x. And canceling one cosine from the top and from the bottom, that's the same thing as cosine of x, which is the right hand side that I was trying to get to. So a combination of a bunch of algebra, and the Pythagorean identity allows me to prove that this equation is true for all values of x, it's an identity. The best way to prove that an equation is an identity it's an identity. The best way to prove that an equation is an identity is to use algebra and to use other identities, like the Pythagorean identity to rewrite one side of the equation till it looks like the other side. The best way to prove the net equation is not an identity is to plug in numbers that break the identity. That is make the equation not true. Now if you're just trying to decide if an equation has an identity or not, and not worried about proving it, then I recommend plugging in numbers, or graphing the left and right sides to see if those graphs are the same. Recall that an identity is an equation that holds for all values of the variable. This video states and proves three identities called the Pythagorean identities. The first one is the familiar cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one. The second one says tan squared theta plus one equals secant squared theta. And the third one goes cotangent squared theta plus one equals cosecant squared theta. Let's start by proving that cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one. I'll do this by drawing the unit circle with a right triangle inside it by the definition of sine and cosine, the x&y coordinates of this top point, r cosine theta and sine theta, the high partners, my triangle is one, since that's the radius of my unit circle. Now the length of the base of my triangle is the same thing as the x coordinate of this point. So that's equal to cosine theta. The height of this triangle is the same thing as the y coordinate of this point. So that's sine theta. Now the Pythagoras theorem for right triangles, says this side length squared plus that side length squared is equal to the hypothenar squared. So by the Pythagorean theorem, we have that cosine theta squared plus sine theta squared equals one squared, I can rewrite that as cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one, since one squared is one, and cosine squared theta is just a shorthand notation for cosine theta squared. That completes the proof of the first Pythagorean identity, at least in the case, when the angle theta is in the first quadrant. In the case, when the angle was in a different quadrant, you can use symmetry to argue the same identity holds. But I won't give the details here. To prove the next Pythagorean identity, tan squared theta plus one equals secant squared theta, let's use the first without your an identity, which said that cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one, I'm going to divide both sides of this equation by cosine squared theta. Now I'm going to rewrite the left side by breaking apart the fraction into cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta over cosine squared theta. Now cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta is just one. And I can rewrite the next fraction as sine of theta over cosine of theta squared. That's because when I square a fraction, I can just square the numerator and square the denominator. And sine squared theta is shorthand for sine of theta squares. Similarly, for cosine squared theta. Now on the other side of the equal sign, I can rewrite this fraction as one over cosine theta squared. Again, that's because when I square the fraction, I just get the one squared, which is one divided by the cosine theta squared, which is this. I'm almost done. sine theta over cosine theta is the same thing as tangent theta. And one over cosine theta is the same thing as secant theta. Using the shorthand notation, that says one plus tan squared theta equals sequencer data, which, after rearranging is exactly the identity that we were looking for. The proof of the third for that green identity is very similar. Once again, I'll start with the identity is to use algebra and to use other identities, like the Pythagorean identity to rewrite one side of the equation till it looks like the other side. The best way to prove the net equation is not an identity is to plug in numbers that break the identity. That is make the equation not true.

Using the shorthand notation, that says one plus tan squared theta equals sequencer data, which, after rearranging is exactly the identity that we were looking for. The proof of the third for that green identity is very similar. Once again, I'll start with the identity cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one, and this time, I'll divide both sides by sine squared theta. I'll break up the fraction on the left. And now I'll rewrite my fractions as cosine theta over sine theta squared plus one equals one over sine theta squared. cosine over sine can be written As cotangent, and one over sine can be written as cosecant. That gives me the identity that I'm looking for. We've now proved three trig identities. The first one, we proved using the unit circle, and the Pythagorean Theorem. The second and third identities, we proved by using the first identity, and a bit of algebra. The sum and difference formulas are formulas for computing the sine of a sum of two angles, the cosine of a sum of two angles, the sine of a difference of two angles, and the cosine of a difference of two angles. Please pause the video for a moment to think about this question. Is it true that the sine of A plus B is equal to the sine of A plus the sine of B? No, it's not true. And we can see by an example, if we plug in say, A equals pi over two and B equals pi, than the sine of pi over two plus pi, is the same thing as a sine of three pi over two, which is negative one. Whereas the sine of pi over two plus the sine of pi is equal to one plus zero, which is one, negative one is not equal to one. So this equation does not hold for all values of a and b. There are a few values of a and b for which it does hold. For example, if a is zero, and B is zero, but it's not true in general, instead, we need more complicated formulas. It turns out that the sine of the sum of two angles A plus B is given by sine of A cosine of B plus cosine of A, sine of B. The cosine of A plus B is given by cosine A cosine B minus sine A sine Bay. I like to remember these with a song, sine cosine cosine sine cosine cosine minus sine sine. Please feel free to back up the video and sing along with me, I encourage you to memorize the two formulas for the sine of a cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one, and this time, I'll divide both sides by sine squared theta. I'll break up the fraction on the left. And now I'll rewrite my fractions as cosine theta over sine theta squared plus one equals one over sine theta squared. cosine over sine can be written As cotangent, and one over sine can be written as cosecant. That gives me the identity that I'm looking for. We've now proved three trig identities. The first one, we proved using the unit circle, and the Pythagorean Theorem. The second and third identities, we proved by using the first identity, and a bit of algebra. The sum and difference formulas are formulas for computing the sine of a sum of two angles, the cosine of a sum of two angles, the sine of a difference of two angles, and the cosine of a difference of two angles. Please pause the video for a moment to think about this question. Is it true that the sine of A plus B is equal to the sine of A plus the sine of B? No, it's not true. And we can see by an example, if we plug in say, A equals pi over two and B equals pi, than the sine of pi over two plus pi, is the same thing as a sine of three pi over two, which is negative one. Whereas the sine of pi over two plus the sine of pi is equal to one plus zero, which is one, negative one is not equal to one. So this equation does not hold for all values of a and b. There are a few values of a and b for which it does hold. For example, if a is zero, and B is zero, but it's not true in general, instead, we need more complicated formulas. It turns out that the sine of the sum of two angles A plus B is given by sine of A cosine of B plus cosine of A, sine of B. The cosine of A plus B is given by cosine A cosine B minus sine A sine Bay. I like to remember these with a song, sine cosine cosine sine cosine cosine minus sine sine. Please feel free to back up the video and sing along with me, I encourage you to memorize the two formulas for the sine of a sum of angles and the cosine of a sum of angles. Once you do, it's easy to figure out the sine sum of angles and the cosine of a sum of angles. Once you do, it's easy to figure out the sine and cosine of a difference of two angles. One way to do this is to think of sine of and cosine of a difference of two angles. One way to do this is to think of sine of A minus B as sine of A plus negative B. And then use the angle sum formula. So this works out to sine cosine plus cosine, sine. And now, if I use the fact that cosine is even, I know that cosine of negative B is cosine of B. And since sine is odd, sine of negative b is negative sine of B. So I can rewrite this as sine of A cosine of B minus cosine of A sine of B. Notice that this new formula for the difference is the same as the formula for the sum is just that plus sign turned into a minus sign. We can do the same trick for cosine of A minus B, that's cosine of A plus minus b, which is cosine A cosine minus b minus sine of A sine of negative B. Again, using even an odd properties, this gives us cosine A cosine B plus sine A sine B. Once again, the formula for the difference is almost exactly like the for the song, just that minus sign has switched to a plus sign. Now let's use the angle sum formula to find the exact value for the sign of 105 degrees. Now, 105 degrees is not a special angle on the unit circle, but I can write it as the sum of two special angles. I can write it as 60 degrees plus 45 degrees. Therefore, the sine of 105 degrees is the sine of 60 plus 45. And now by the angle some formula, this is sine, cosine, cosine, sine. And I for my Unit Circle, I can figure out that sine of 60 degrees is root three over two cosine of 45 degrees root two over two, cosine of 60 degrees is one half, and sine of 45 degrees is root two over two. So this simplifies to root six plus root two over four. For our last example, let's find the cosine of v plus W, given the values of cosine v and cosine W, and the fact that v and w are angles in the first quadrant. Remember, to compute the cosine of a sum, we can't just add together the two cosines. That wouldn't even make sense in this case, because adding point nine and point seven would give something bigger than one and the cosine of something's never bigger than one. Instead, we have to use the angle sum formula for cosine. So that goes cosine of v plus w equals cosine, cosine, minus sine, sine. Now, I've already know the cosine of v and the cosine of W, so I could just plug those in. But I have to figure out the sine of v and the sine of W from the given information. And one way to do that is to draw right triangles. So here, I'm going to draw a right triangle with angle V, A minus B as sine of A plus negative B. And then use the angle sum formula. So this works out to sine cosine plus cosine, sine. And now, if I use the fact that cosine is even, I know that cosine of negative B is cosine of B. And since sine is odd, sine of negative b is negative sine of B. So I can rewrite this as sine of A cosine of B minus cosine of A sine of B. Notice that this new formula for the difference is the same as the formula for the sum is just that plus sign turned into a minus sign. We can do the same trick for cosine of A minus B, that's cosine of A plus minus b, which is cosine A cosine minus b minus sine of A sine of negative B. Again, using even an odd properties, this gives us cosine A cosine B plus sine A sine B. Once again, the formula for the difference is almost exactly like the for the song, just that minus sign has switched to a plus sign. Now let's use the angle sum formula to find the exact value for the sign of 105 degrees. Now, 105 degrees is not a special angle on the unit circle, but I can write it as the sum of two special angles. I can write it as 60 degrees plus 45 degrees. Therefore, the sine of 105 degrees is the sine of 60 plus 45. And now by the angle some formula, this is sine, cosine, cosine, sine. And I for my Unit Circle, I can figure out that sine of 60 degrees is root three over two cosine of 45 degrees root two over two, cosine of 60 degrees is one half, and sine of 45 degrees is root two over two. So this simplifies to root six plus root two over four. For our last example, let's find the cosine of v plus W, given the values of cosine v and cosine W, and the fact that v and w are angles in the first quadrant. Remember, to compute the cosine of a sum, we can't just add together the two cosines. That wouldn't even make sense in this case, because adding point nine and point seven would give something bigger than one and the cosine of something's never bigger than one. Instead, we have to use the angle sum formula for cosine. So that goes cosine of v plus w equals cosine, cosine, minus sine, sine. Now, I've already know the cosine of v and the cosine of W, so I could just plug those in. But I have to figure out the sine of v and the sine of W from the given information. And one way to do that is to draw right triangles. So here, I'm going to draw a right triangle with angle V, and another right triangle with angle W. Since I know that the cosine of V is point nine, I can think of that as nine over 10. and another right triangle with angle W. Since I know that the cosine of V is point nine, I can think of that as nine over 10. And I can think of that as adjacent over hypotenuse in my right triangle. So I'll decorate my triangles adjacent side with the number nine and the hypotenuse with 10. Similarly, since I know that the cosine of W is point seven, which is seven tenths, I can put a seven on this adjacent side, and a 10 on this iPod news. Now, the Pythagorean Theorem, lets me compute the length of the unlabeled side. So this one is going to be the square root of 10 squared minus nine squared, that's going to be the square root of 19. And here I have the square root of 10 squared minus seven squared. So that's the square root of 51. I can now find the sign of V as the opposite over the hi partners. So that's the square root of 19 over 10. And the sign of W will be the square root of 51 over 10. Because we're assuming v and w are in the first quadrant, we know the values of sign need to be positive, so we don't need to Jimmy around with positive or negative signs in our answers, we can just leave them as is. And I can think of that as adjacent over hypotenuse in my right triangle. So I'll decorate my triangles adjacent side with the number nine and the hypotenuse with 10. Similarly, since I know that the cosine of W is point seven, which is seven tenths, I can put a seven on this adjacent side, and a 10 on this iPod news. Now, the Pythagorean Theorem, lets me compute the length of the unlabeled side. So this one is going to be the square root of 10 squared minus nine squared, that's going to be the square root of 19. And here I have the square root of 10 squared minus seven squared. So that's the square root of 51. I can now find the sign of V as the opposite over the hi partners. So that's the square root of 19 over 10. And the sign of W will be the square root of 51 over 10. Because we're assuming v and w are in the first quadrant, we know the values of sign need to be positive, so we don't need to Jimmy around with positive or negative signs in our answers, we can just leave them as is. Now we're ready to plug into our formula. So we have that cosine of v plus w is equal to point nine times point seven minus the square root of 19 over 10, times the square root of 51 over 10. Now we're ready to plug into our formula. So we have that cosine of v plus w is equal to point nine times point seven minus the square root of 19 over 10, times the square root of 51 over 10. using a calculator, this works out to a decimal approximation of 0.3187. This video gave the angle sum and difference formulas and use them to compute some values. To see a proof for why the sum formulas hold, please watch my other video. This video gives formulas for sine of two theta and cosine of two theta. Please pause the video for a moment and see if you think this equation sine of two theta equals two sine theta is true or false. Remember that true means always true for all values of theta were false means sometimes they're always false. This equation is false, because it's not true for all values of theta. One way to see this is graphically, if I graph y equals sine of two theta, that's like the graph of sine theta, squished in horizontally by a factor of one half. On the other hand, if I graph y equals two sine beta, that's like the graph of sine theta stretched vertically by a factor of two. These two graphs are not the same. So instead, we need a more complicated formula for sine of two theta. And that formula is sine of two theta is two sine theta, cosine theta. It's not hard to see why that formula works based on the angle some formula. Recall that sine of A plus B is equal to sine A cosine B plus cosine A sign Therefore, sine of two theta, which is sine of theta plus theta is going to be sine theta, cosine theta, plus cosine theta sine theta. simply plugging in theta for a and theta for B, in this angle, some formula, will sine theta cosine theta is the same thing as cosine theta sine theta. So I can rewrite this as twice sine theta cosine theta. That gives me this formula. There's also a formula for cosine of two theta. And that formula is cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta. Again, we can use the angle sum formula to see where this comes from. cosine of A plus B is equal to cosine of A cosine of B minus sine A, sine B. So if we want cosine of two theta, that's just cosine of theta plus theta, which is cosine theta, cosine theta, minus sine theta, sine theta by plugging in beta for a and b, this can be rewritten as cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta, which is exactly the formula above. Now there are a couple other formulas for cosine of two theta that are also popular. One of them is one minus two sine squared theta. And the other one is cosine of two theta is two cosine squared theta minus one, you can get each of these two formulas from the original one using the Pythagorean identity. We know that cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta is one. So cosine squared theta is one minus sine squared theta. If I plug that into my original formula, which I've copied here, so I'm plugging in, instead of cosine squared, I'm gonna write one minus sine squared theta, I still have a nother minus sine squared theta. So that's the same thing as one minus twice science grid data, which is exactly what I'm looking for. Similarly, I can use the Pythagorean identity to write sine squared theta as one minus cosine squared theta. Again, I'll take this equation and copy it below. But this time, I'm going to plug in for sine squared right here. So that gives me cosine of two theta is cosine squared theta minus the quantity one minus cosine squared theta. That simplifies to two cosine squared theta minus one after distributing the negative sign and combining like terms. using a calculator, this works out to a decimal approximation of 0.3187. This video gave the angle sum and difference formulas and use them to compute some values. To see a proof for why the sum formulas hold, please watch my other video. This video gives formulas for sine of two theta and cosine of two theta. Please pause the video for a moment and see if you think this equation sine of two theta equals two sine theta is true or false. Remember that true means always true for all values of theta were false means sometimes they're always false. This equation is false, because it's not true for all values of theta. One way to see this is graphically, if I graph y equals sine of two theta, that's like the graph of sine theta, squished in horizontally by a factor of one half. On the other hand, if I graph y equals two sine beta, that's like the graph of sine theta stretched vertically by a factor of two. These two graphs are not the same. So instead, we need a more complicated formula for sine of two theta. And that formula is sine of two theta is two sine theta, cosine theta. It's not hard to see why that formula works based on the angle some formula. Recall that sine of A plus B is equal to sine A cosine B plus cosine A sign Therefore, sine of two theta, which is sine of theta plus theta is going to be sine theta, cosine theta, plus cosine theta sine theta. simply plugging in theta for a and theta for B, in this angle, some formula, will sine theta cosine theta is the same thing as cosine theta sine theta. So I can rewrite this as twice sine theta cosine theta. That gives me this formula. There's also a formula for cosine of two theta. And that formula is cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta. Again, we can use the angle sum formula to see where this comes from. cosine of A plus B is equal to cosine of A cosine of B minus sine A, sine B. So if we want cosine of two theta, that's just cosine of theta plus theta, which is cosine theta, cosine theta, minus sine theta, sine theta by plugging in beta for a and b, this can be rewritten as cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta, which is exactly the formula above. Now there are a couple other formulas for cosine of two theta that are also popular. One of them is one minus two sine squared theta. And the other one is cosine of two theta is two cosine squared theta minus one, you can get each of these two formulas from the original one using the Pythagorean identity. We know that cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta is one. So cosine squared theta is one minus sine squared theta. If I plug that into my original formula, which I've copied here, so I'm plugging in, instead of cosine squared, I'm gonna write one minus sine squared theta, I still have a nother minus sine squared theta. So that's the same thing as one minus twice science grid data, which is exactly what I'm looking for. Similarly, I can use the Pythagorean identity to write sine squared theta as one minus cosine squared theta. Again, I'll take this equation and copy it below. But this time, I'm going to plug in for sine squared right here. So that gives me cosine of two theta is cosine squared theta minus the quantity one minus cosine squared theta. That simplifies to two cosine squared theta minus one after distributing the negative sign and combining like terms. So I have one double angle formula for sine of two theta. And I have three versions of the double angle formula for cosine of two theta. So I have one double angle formula for sine of two theta. And I have three versions of the double angle formula for cosine of two theta. Now let's use these formulas in some examples. Let's find the cosine of two theta. If we know that cosine theta is negative one over root 10, and theta terminates in quadrant three, we have a choice of three formulas for cosine of two theta, I'm going to choose the second one, because it only involves cosine if they had on the right side. And they already know my value for cosine theta. Of course, I could use one of the other ones, Now let's use these formulas in some examples. Let's find the cosine of two theta. If we know that cosine theta is negative one over root 10, and theta terminates in quadrant three, we have a choice of three formulas for cosine of two theta, I'm going to choose the second one, because it only involves cosine if they had on the right side. And they already know my value for cosine theta. Of course, I could use one of the other ones, but then I'd have to work out the value of sine theta. So plugging in, I get cosine of two theta is twice negative one over root n squared minus one, which simplifies to two tenths minus one or negative eight tenths, negative four fifths. Finally, let's solve the equation two cosine x plus sine of 2x equals zero. What makes this equation tricky is that one of the trig functions has the argument of just x, but the other tree function has the argument of 2x. So I want to use my double angle formula to rewrite sine of 2x. I'll copy down the two cosine x, and now sine of 2x is equal to two sine x cosine x. At this point, I see a way to factor my equation, I can factor out a two cosine x from both of these two terms. That gives me one plus sine x and the product there is equal to zero. That means that either two cosine x is equal to zero One plus sine x is equal to zero, that simplifies to cosine x equals zero, or sine x is negative one. Using my unit circle, I see that cosine of x is zero at pi over two, and three pi over two, while sine of x is negative one at three pi over two, there's some redundancy here, but my solution set is going to be pi over two plus multiples of two pi, and three pi over two plus multiples of two pi. This video proved the double angle formulas, sine of two theta is two sine theta cosine theta. and cosine of two theta is cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta. It also proved to alternate versions of the equation for cosine of two theta. This video introduces higher order derivatives and notation. We've seen that f prime of x denotes the derivative of the function f of x, but f prime of x is also itself a function. So we can take its derivative, that would be f prime prime of x, which is usually written instead as f double prime of x. This is called the second derivative of f. And it means the derivative of the derivative, we can also talk about the third derivative, f triple prime of x, which might sometimes be written f to the three of x if you get tired of writing all those primes, and we can talk about the nth derivative f, parentheses n of x, the parentheses here are important to show that it's the nth derivative. The second, third and nth derivative are referred to as higher order but then I'd have to work out the value of sine theta. So plugging in, I get cosine of two theta is twice negative one over root n squared minus one, which simplifies to two tenths minus one or negative eight tenths, negative four fifths. Finally, let's solve the equation two cosine x plus sine of 2x equals zero. What makes this equation tricky is that one of the trig functions has the argument of just x, but the other tree function has the argument of 2x. So I want to use my double angle formula to rewrite sine of 2x. I'll copy down the two cosine x, and now sine of 2x is equal to two sine x cosine x. At this point, I see a way to factor my equation, I can factor out a two cosine x from both of these two terms. That gives me one plus sine x and the product there is equal to zero. That means that either two cosine x is equal to zero One plus sine x is equal to zero, that simplifies to cosine x equals zero, or sine x is negative one. Using my unit circle, I see that cosine of x is zero at pi over two, and three pi over two, while sine of x is negative one at three pi over two, there's some redundancy here, but my solution set is going to be pi over two plus multiples of two pi, and three pi over two plus multiples of two pi. This video proved the double angle formulas, sine of two theta is two sine theta cosine theta. and cosine of two theta is cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta. It also proved to alternate versions of the equation for cosine of two theta. This video introduces higher order derivatives and notation. We've seen that f prime of x denotes the derivative of the function f of x, but f prime of x is also itself a function.

The second, third and nth derivative are referred to as higher order derivatives. derivatives. There are many alternative notations for derivatives stemming from their tangled and contentious history in the 1600s. There are a few different notations for functions themselves. Most often we write a function of something like f of x, but we can also use the variable y to refer to the output of a function. When we're looking at the first derivative. We've been using the notation f prime of x. But you might also see y prime, this means the same thing. Another notation is df dx, is known as lug nuts denotation. After five minutes, you might see something like dy dx of f of x. And you might see dy dx, another version of Lebanon's notation. Sometimes you'll also see a capital D used to refer to the derivative. If we're looking at the second derivative, we've seen that in Haitian f double prime of x, y double prime is a similar notation, or we might write dy dx of df There are many alternative notations for derivatives stemming from their tangled and contentious history in the 1600s.

And the shorthand for that is d squared f dx squared. Similarly, we might write d squared y dx squared using y in the place of F for the function. And the shorthand for that is d squared f dx squared. Similarly, we might write d squared y dx squared using y in the place of F for the function. There's similar notations for third derivative, I'll jump ahead to nth derivatives. So that would be F to the n of x, or y to the n, d to the n of f dx to the n, or D to the n of y dx to the N. When using live minutes notation, we want to emphasize that we're evaluating our derivative at a particular value of x, we might write something like at x equals three, or at x equals a, using a vertical line. For better or for worse, you'll need to become familiar with all of these alternative notations. There's similar notations for third derivative, I'll jump ahead to nth derivatives.

This video is about the derivative of e to the x, one of my favorite functions ever simply because it has such a great derivative. As you may recall, he is an irrational number whose decimal approximation is something like 2.718 looks like it's repeating. But then it keeps going on forever, never repeating never terminating. That's all for this video on higher order derivatives and notation. This video is about the derivative of e to the x, one of my favorite functions ever simply because it has such a great derivative. As you may recall, he is an irrational number whose decimal approximation is something like 2.718 looks like it's repeating. But then it keeps going on forever, never repeating never terminating. Its value notice is somewhere in between two and three. Here is a graph of y equals e to the x. Its value notice is somewhere in between two and three. Here is a graph of y equals e to the x. It says exponential function increase thing looks a lot like two to the x or three to the x, not only is the graph of e to the x increasing, but it's increasing more and more rapidly. So for negative values of x, the slope of this graph is positive but very close to zero. Over here, when x equals zero, that slope is looks like approximately a slope of one, we'll see that it is in fact exactly one. And as the x values increase, this tangent lines get steeper and steeper. I'm going to state without proof, three really useful facts about E. First, if you take the limit, as n goes to infinity of one plus one over N raised to the nth power, that limit exists and equals E, you might have seen something like that when you took precalculus, and looked at compound interest compounded over smaller and smaller time periods. But even if you haven't seen it before, it's a really important fact worth memorizing, you'll see it again later in the class. A second important formula is that the limit as h goes to zero of e to the H minus one over h equals one. Now this expression here on the left may remind you of a derivative, in fact, I can rewrite it as the limit as h goes to zero of e to the zero plus h minus e to the zero since either the zero is one over h, that's equal to one. And this expression right here on the left is just the derivative of e to the x at x equals zero, according to the limit definition of derivative. So this fact, is really saying that the derivative of e to the x at x equals zero, that derivative is equal to one. So for the third fat, It says exponential function increase thing looks a lot like two to the x or three to the x, not only is the graph of e to the x increasing, but it's increasing more and more rapidly. So for negative values of x, the slope of this graph is positive but very close to zero.

A second important formula is that the limit as h goes to zero of e to the H minus one over h equals one. Now this expression here on the left may remind you of a derivative, in fact, I can rewrite it as the limit as h goes to zero of e to the zero plus h minus e to the zero since either the zero is one over h, that's equal to one. And this expression right here on the left is just the derivative of e to the x at x equals zero, according to the limit definition of derivative. So this fact, is really saying that the derivative of e to the x at x equals zero, that derivative is equal to one. So for the third fat, the third fact, the third fact, it talks about the derivative of e to the x in general. And that third fact is that the derivative of the function, either the X is the function, e to the x, e to the x is its own derivative. So this is a generalized version of the second fact. Because the second fact is saying that the derivative at x equals zero is one, well, one is just the same thing as e to the zero. So it saying the drought of either the exit at x equals zero is equal to zero. And in general, the derivative of e to the x at any x is just e to the x. Now, fact, one is frequently taken as the definition of E. Sometimes fact two instead is taken as a definition of he, since he is the unique number with this, this property, the unique number, you can plug in here and get this limit equal one, it's possible to prove that fact one implies fact two and vice versa. But I won't do that here. It's also possible to prove that fact two implies fact three about the derivative in general. And that's pretty straightforward from the definition of derivative. So I will show you that argument. So let's start out assuming fact to and try to prove fact three using the definition of direct by the definition of derivative. The derivative of e to the x is the limit as h goes to zero of e to the x plus h minus e to the x over h. If I factor out an E to the X, from both terms on the numerator, I get the limit of e to the x times e to the H minus one over h. Notice that e to the x times e to the H is in the x plus h by the exponent rules. Now, either the X has nothing to do with H, so it's just a constant as far as H is concerned. And I can pull it all the way out of the limit sign and rewrite this limit. Now by factor two, which I'm assuming this limit here is just one, which means that my derivative it talks about the derivative of e to the x in general. And that third fact is that the derivative of the function, either the X is the function, e to the x, e to the x is its own derivative. So this is a generalized version of the second fact. Because the second fact is saying that the derivative at x equals zero is one, well, one is just the same thing as e to the zero. So it saying the drought of either the exit at x equals zero is equal to zero. And in general, the derivative of e to the x at any x is just e to the x. Now, fact, one is frequently taken as the definition of E. Sometimes fact two instead is taken as a definition of he, since he is the unique number with this, this property, the unique number, you can plug in here and get this limit equal one, it's possible to prove that fact one implies fact two and vice versa. But I won't do that here. It's also possible to prove that fact two implies fact three about the derivative in general. And that's pretty straightforward from the definition of derivative. So I will show you that argument. So let's start out assuming fact to and try to prove fact three using the definition of direct by the definition of derivative. The derivative of e to the x is the limit as h goes to zero of e to the x plus h minus e to the x over h. If I factor out an E to the X, from both terms on the numerator, I get the limit of e to the x times e to the H minus one over h. Notice that e to the x times e to the H is in the x plus h by the exponent rules. Now, either the X has nothing to do with H, so it's just a constant as far as H is concerned. And I can pull it all the way out of the limit sign and rewrite this limit. Now by factor two, which I'm assuming this limit here is just one, which means that my derivative is e to the x, just like I wanted to show. Here's a slightly tricky example, asking you to compute the derivative of a function that involves lots of ears and X's is e to the x, just like I wanted to show. Here's a slightly tricky example, asking you to compute the derivative of a function that involves lots of ears and X's combined in lots of different ways. You'll need to use not only the rule for the derivative of e to the x that we just talked about, but also the power rule and other rules. derivatives that we've talked about combined in lots of different ways. You'll need to use not only the rule for the derivative of e to the x that we just talked about, but also the power rule and other rules. derivatives that we've talked about earlier. earlier. So please pause the video and try to compute this derivative yourself paying careful attention to what's a variable and what's the constant. So please pause the video and try to compute this derivative yourself paying careful attention to what's a variable and what's the constant. Okay, so we're taking the derivative here with respect to x, that's our variable. And I'm taking the derivative of this entire expression, which I can split up as a sum of derivatives. For the first term, I can just use the power rule, E is a constant coefficient, so I just need to take down the exponent of two multiplied on the front, times x to the One Power. Now for the second part, Okay, so we're taking the derivative here with respect to x, that's our variable. And I'm taking the derivative of this entire expression, which I can split up as a sum of derivatives. For the first term, I can just use the power rule, E is a constant coefficient, so I just need to take down the exponent of two multiplied on the front, times x to the One Power. Now for the second part, here, I do have my either the x function multiplied by two, so its derivative is just two times the derivative of e to the x, which is either the X here, I do have my either the x function multiplied by two, so its derivative is just two times the derivative of e to the x, which is either the X for my third part, I have just x times a constant e squared. So the derivative of x is one times that constant. And so I just get e squared. Finally, to take the derivative of x to the power of E squared, I can use the power rule because my variable is in the base, and I have a constant e squared in my exponent. So using the power rule, I bring down the E squared times that by x and subtract one from the exponent. This video states the happy fact that the derivative of e to the x is just e to for my third part, I have just x times a constant e squared. So the derivative of x is one times that constant. And so I just get e squared. Finally, to take the derivative of x to the power of E squared, I can use the power rule because my variable is in the base, and I have a constant e squared in my exponent. So using the power rule, I bring down the E squared times that by x and subtract one from the exponent. This video states the happy fact that the derivative of e to the x is just e to the x. This video prove some of the rules for taking derivatives. the x. This video prove some of the rules for taking derivatives. First, the constant row, it makes sense that the derivative of a constant real number has to be zero, because the slope of a horizontal line First, the constant row, it makes sense that the derivative of a constant real number has to be zero, because the slope of a horizontal line is zero. is zero. But we can also prove this fact, using the limit definition of derivative. The derivative of any function is the limit as h goes to zero of the function of x plus h minus the function at x divided by H. Well, here, our function is just a constant. So we're taking the limit as h goes to zero of the constant minus the constant divided by h, which is just the limit as h goes to zero of zero over h, which is just the limit of zero, which is zero. Intuitively, it also makes sense that the derivative of the function y equals x is got to be one, because the graph of y equals x is a straight line with slope one. But again, we can prove this using the limit definition of derivative. So the derivative of x is the limit as h goes to zero of x plus h minus x over h. Well, that simplifies to the limit of h over h, since the Xs can't So in other words, the limit as h goes to zero of one, which is one as wanted But we can also prove this fact, using the limit definition of derivative. The derivative of any function is the limit as h goes to zero of the function of x plus h minus the function at x divided by H. Well, here, our function is just a constant. So we're taking the limit as h goes to zero of the constant minus the constant divided by h, which is just the limit as h goes to zero of zero over h, which is just the limit of zero, which is zero. Intuitively, it also makes sense that the derivative of the function y equals x is got to be one, because the graph of y equals x is a straight line with slope one. But again, we can prove this using the limit definition of derivative. So the derivative of x is the limit as h goes to zero of x plus h minus x over h. Well, that simplifies to the limit of h over h, since the Xs can't So in other words, the limit as h goes to zero of one, which is one as wanted x, x, h to the n minus one, and then finally, a term of h to the N. That's the binomial expansion of x plus h to the n. Now, we still have to subtract the x to the n that we had up here, and we still have to divide this whole thing by H. Okay, that's looking kind of horribly complicated. h to the n minus one, and then finally, a term of h to the N. That's the binomial expansion of x plus h to the n. Now, we still have to subtract the x to the n that we had up here, and we still have to divide this whole thing by H. Okay, that's looking kind of horribly complicated. But But notice that the X to the ends can So notice that all of the remaining terms have an H in them. So if we factor out that H, we get an x to the n minus one, plus a bunch of other terms. And canceling the H's, notice that the X to the ends can So notice that all of the remaining terms have an H in them. So if we factor out that H, we get an x to the n minus one, plus a bunch of other terms. And canceling the H's, we get we get one term that doesn't have any ages in it, and another bunch of terms that all have H's in them, as h goes to zero, all these other terms drop out because they go to zero. And what we're left with is simply n times x to the n minus one, which is exactly what we want for the power role. I think that's a pretty good proof if you're comfortable with the binomial formula. But if you haven't seen the binomial formula before, that might leave you feeling a little cold. So I'm going to offer you another proof using the other form of the limit definition of derivative. So let me clear some space here. And I'll start over using this definition, f prime at a is the limit as x goes to a of our function evaluated at x. So that's x to the n minus our function evaluated at a, that's a to the n over x minus a. Again, I'm going to need to rewrite things in order to evaluate this limit, since it's currently in a zero over zero and determinant form. So I'm going to rewrite the top by factoring out a copy of x minus a, which gives me x to the n minus one plus x to the n minus two A plus x to the n minus three A squared, you see the pattern here. And I keep going until I get to x a to the n minus two and finally a to the n minus one, that's still over x minus a, you can verify this factoring formula, simply by multiplying out and checking that you In fact, do get x to the n minus a to the n, after all your intermediate terms cancel. Now that I've factored, I can cancel my x minus a, and simply evaluate my limit by plugging in x equal to A to get a to the n minus one plus a to the n minus two A plus, and so on each of these terms is equal to a to the n minus one. And there are a total of n terms, since we got them from the terms above that started with x to the n minus one and did with x to the zero. So that's n terms. So that means we've got a final sum of n times a to the n minus one for a derivative f prime of A, which is exactly what we wanted to show. Next, I'll prove the constant multiple rule that says that if c is a real number constant, and f is a differentiable function, then the derivative of a constant times f is just the constant times the derivative of f. Starting with the limit definition of derivative, I have that the derivative of C times f of x is the limit as h goes to zero of C times f of x plus h minus c times f of x over h. Now if I factor out the constant C, from both of these terms, and actually I can pull it all the way out of the limit side, since the constant has nothing to do with h. So now I get that was equal to the constant times the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h minus f of x over h, which is just a constant times the derivative of f, which is what we wanted to prove. one term that doesn't have any ages in it, and another bunch of terms that all have H's in them, as h goes to zero, all these other terms drop out because they go to zero. And what we're left with is simply n times x to the n minus one, which is exactly what we want for the power role. I think that's a pretty good proof if you're comfortable with the binomial formula. But if you haven't seen the binomial formula before, that might leave you feeling a little cold. So I'm going to offer you another proof using the other form of the limit definition of derivative. So let me clear some space here. And I'll start over using this definition, f prime at a is the limit as x goes to a of our function evaluated at x. So that's x to the n minus our function evaluated at a, that's a to the n over x minus a. Again, I'm going to need to rewrite things in order to evaluate this limit, since it's currently in a zero over zero and determinant form. So I'm going to rewrite the top by factoring out a copy of x minus a, which gives me x to the n minus one plus x to the n minus two A plus x to the n minus three A squared, you see the pattern here. And I keep going until I get to x a to the n minus two and finally a to the n minus one, that's still over x minus a, you can verify this factoring formula, simply by multiplying out and checking that you In fact, do get x to the n minus a to the n, after all your intermediate terms cancel. Now that I've factored, I can cancel my x minus a, and simply evaluate my limit by plugging in x equal to A to get a to the n minus one plus a to the n minus two A plus, and so on each of these terms is equal to a to the n minus one. And there are a total of n terms, since we got them from the terms above that started with x to the n minus one and did with x to the zero. So that's n terms. So that means we've got a final sum of n times a to the n minus one for a derivative f prime of A, which is exactly what we wanted to show. Next, I'll prove the constant multiple rule that says that if c is a real number constant, and f is a differentiable function, then the derivative of a constant times f is just the constant times the derivative of f. Starting with the limit definition of derivative, I have that the derivative of C times f of x is the limit as h goes to zero of C times f of x plus h minus c times f of x over h. Now if I factor out the constant C, from both of these terms, and actually I can pull it all the way out of the limit side, since the constant has nothing to do with h. So now I get that was equal to the constant times the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h minus f of x over h, which is just a constant times the derivative of f, which is what we wanted to prove. The difference rule can be proved just like the sum rule by writing out the definition of derivative and regrouping terms. Or we could use kind of a sneaky shortcut, and put together two of our previous roles. So if we think of f of x minus g of x as being f of x plus minus one times g of x, then we can use the sum rule to rewrite this as a sum of derivatives, and then use the constant multiplier rule to pull the constant of negative one out, and then we have exactly what we wanted to prove. So in this video, we gave the proof of the content multiple rule, the summon difference rules, and a proof of the power rule when n is a positive integer. This video gives rules for calculating derivatives of functions that are products, or quotients of other functions. In this video, you'll find statements of the product rule and the quotient rule, and some examples. But no proofs, proofs are in a separate video. Before we start, let's recall the Psalm and the difference rules. If f and g are differentiable functions, then the derivative of the psalm f of x plus g of x is just the sum of the derivatives. And a similar statement holds for differences. The derivative of the difference is the difference of the derivatives. So does the same sort of rule hold for products of functions, in other words, is the derivative of the product equal to the product of the derivatives? Let's look at a simple example. To find out. For example, if f of x is x, and g of x is x squared, then if we take the derivative of the product, x times x squared, well, that's just the derivative of x cubed. We know how to do that with the power rule. So it's 3x squared. On the other hand, if we look at the product of the derivatives, we get one times 2x or just 2x. And these two things are not equal. So unfortunately, the answer is no such a simple product rule does not hold. But not lose hope. There is a product rule, it's just a little more complicated than the sum and difference rule. The product rule says that if f and g are differentiable functions, then the derivative of the product f of x times g of x is equal to f of x times the derivative of g of x plus the derivative of f of x times g of x. In other words, to take the derivative of a product, we take the first function times the derivative of the second, plus the derivative of the first times the second. Let's use this in an example. To take the derivative of the square root of t times e to the t, we have to take the first function squared of t times the derivative of the second function, plus the derivative of the first function The difference rule can be proved just like the sum rule by writing out the definition of derivative and regrouping terms. Or we could use kind of a sneaky shortcut, and put together two of our previous roles. So if we think of f of x minus g of x as being f of x plus minus one times g of x, then we can use the sum rule to rewrite this as a sum of derivatives, and then use the constant multiplier rule to pull the constant of negative one out, and then we have exactly what we wanted to prove. So in this video, we gave the proof of the content multiple rule, the summon difference rules, and a proof of the power rule when n is a positive integer. This video gives rules for calculating derivatives of functions that are products, or quotients of other functions. In this video, you'll find statements of the product rule and the quotient rule, and some examples. But no proofs, proofs are in a separate video.

To take the derivative of the square root of t times e to the t, we have to take the first function squared of t times the derivative of the second function, plus the derivative of the first function times the second function. So that's the square root of t times the derivative of e to the t is just e to the t. times the second function. So that's the square root of t times the derivative of e to the t is just e to the t. And to find the derivative of the square root of t, it's going to be easier to write it in exponential form. Now we can just use the power roll. Bring down the one half t to the one half minus one is negative one half and I found the derivative. I'm going to clean this up a little bit, and I'm done. quotient rule says that the derivative of a quotient of two functions And to find the derivative of the square root of t, it's going to be easier to write it in exponential form. Now we can just use the power roll. Bring down the one half t to the one half minus one is negative one half and I found the derivative. I'm going to clean this up a little bit, and I'm done. quotient rule says that the derivative of a quotient of two functions is given By this quotient on the denominator, we have the denominator function g of x squared. And on the numerator, we have g of x times the derivative is given By this quotient on the denominator, we have the denominator function g of x squared. And on the numerator, we have g of x times the derivative of f of x of f of x minus f of x times the derivative of g of x. The way I remember this is this chant. If you think of f of x as the high function, and g of x is a low function, you can say this is low D high minus high D low minus f of x times the derivative of g of x. The way I remember this is this chant. If you think of f of x as the high function, and g of x is a low function, you can say this is low D high minus high D low over low low, over low low, we're low low means the low function squared. Let's start with a pretty simple example. So this derivative, taking us back to z here, we're low low means the low function squared. Let's start with a pretty simple example. So this derivative, taking us back to z here, we put the low low on the bottom, and then we go low, we put the low low on the bottom, and then we go low, D high. D high. z squared is to z minus high, D low the derivative of Z's cubed plus one is three z squared plus zero, don't really need to write the zero there, I can simplify here a little bit to z to the fourth plus two z minus three z to the fourth, z squared is to z minus high, D low the derivative of Z's cubed plus one is three z squared plus zero, don't really need to write the zero there, I can simplify here a little bit to z to the fourth plus two z minus three z to the fourth, over, I'm over, I'm not going to bother multiplying out this denominator, I think it looks simpler with it factored. So when I cancel things on the numerator, I'm getting to z minus z to the fourth over z cubed plus one squared as the derivative of my quotient. So in this video, we saw the product rule and the quotient rule. I've written the rules here using the prime notation instead of the dy dx notation, but you should check that the formulas are really the same as before. For the proofs of these fabulously useful rules, you'll have to watch the next video. In this video, I'll prove the product rule and the quotient rule, along with one more related rule, called the reciprocal rule. First, the proof of the product rule. To find the derivative of the product, f of x times g of x, I'm going to start as usual with the limit definition of derivative. So the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h g of x plus h minus f of x g of x, Oliver H. Now I'd like to make this expression here look more like the expression above it, which is where I'm heading for. And to do this, I'm going to use a classic trick of adding zero to my expression and kind of a devious way. So I'm going to rewrite my expression, leaving the first term and the last term of the numerator as they are, but inserting two new terms that cancel. So I'm subtracting the term, f of x, g of x plus h, and then adding it back again. So they won't change the value of my expression. This is not as pointless as it seems, because now we can factor out the common factor of g of x plus h from the first two terms, and the common factor of f of x from the next two terms. So I'm going to do that. And now I'll rewrite again, splitting up my sum into two pieces here. You can use just algebra fractions to see that this expression here and this expression here are the same. Notice that I'm taking the limit of this entire expression here. Now my limit rules allow me to rewrite this limit as four separate limits, provided that these four limits do in fact exist, which that tell you show you in a moment that they do. So this first limit here is just equal to g of x, because G is a continuous function. G is continuous because by assumption it's differentiable, so it has to be continuous. This second limit here, you'll recognize as the definition of the derivative of f, so that limit exists at equals d dx of f of x. The third limit, well, f of x has nothing to do with age. So that limit is just f of x. And finally, the fourth limit is the derivative of g. And we've done it. Well, modulus some minor rearrangement, you'll see that this expression here, is exactly the same as this expression here, just with the order of the terms switched around. Before we go on to prove the quotient rule, it'll be really handy to prove the reciprocal rule, which states that the derivative of reciprocal, one over f of x is given by negative the derivative of f of x divided by f of x squared. So to prove this fact, let's start as usual, with the definition of derivative. The derivative of one over f of x is the limit as h goes to zero of one over f of not going to bother multiplying out this denominator, I think it looks simpler with it factored. So when I cancel things on the numerator, I'm getting to z minus z to the fourth over z cubed plus one squared as the derivative of my quotient. So in this video, we saw the product rule and the quotient rule. I've written the rules here using the prime notation instead of the dy dx notation, but you should check that the formulas are really the same as before. For the proofs of these fabulously useful rules, you'll have to watch the next video.

To find the derivative of the product, f of x times g of x, I'm going to start as usual with the limit definition of derivative. So the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h g of x plus h minus f of x g of x, Oliver H. Now I'd like to make this expression here look more like the expression above it, which is where I'm heading for.

So this first limit here is just equal to g of x, because G is a continuous function. G is continuous because by assumption it's differentiable, so it has to be continuous. This second limit here, you'll recognize as the definition of the derivative of f, so that limit exists at equals d dx of f of x. The third limit, well, f of x has nothing to do with age. So that limit is just f of x. And finally, the fourth limit is the derivative of g. And we've done it. Well, modulus some minor rearrangement, you'll see that this expression here, is exactly the same as this expression here, just with the order of the terms switched around. Before we go on to prove the quotient rule, it'll be really handy to prove the reciprocal rule, which states that the derivative of reciprocal, one over f of x is given by negative the derivative of f of x divided by f of x squared. So to prove this fact, let's start as usual, with the definition of derivative. The derivative of one over f of x is the limit as h goes to zero of one over f of x plus x plus h minus one over f of x over h. Now, these fractions here are just crying out to be combined by finding a common denominator that common denominators f of x plus h times f of x. So let me do that. I've just multiplied the first fraction by f of x over f of x and the second fraction by f of x plus h over f of x plus h in order to rewrite with a common denominator. So that gives me f of x minus f of x plus h divided by f of x plus h times f of x. And instead of dividing this whole thing by H, I'll multiply it by one of our age, which gives me another factor of H in the denominator. Now, this expression here is looking a lot like the derivative of h minus one over f of x over h. Now, these fractions here are just crying out to be combined by finding a common denominator that common denominators f of x plus h times f of x. So let me do that. I've just multiplied the first fraction by f of x over f of x and the second fraction by f of x plus h over f of x plus h in order to rewrite with a common denominator. So that gives me f of x minus f of x plus h divided by f of x plus h times f of x. And instead of dividing this whole thing by H, I'll multiply it by one of our age, which gives me another factor of H in the denominator. Now, this expression here is looking a lot like the derivative of f. f. It's just in the reverse order. So let me factor out a negative sign in order to let me switch that order here. So this becomes f of x plus h minus f of x over h, and then I've got the times one over f of x plus h times f of x. Now I can split this limit up first, I'll factor out the negative sign. And then I'll write this product as a product of two limits, which I can do provided the component limits exist. And I'll check that these limits do exist. Let's see the first limit here. The first limit here is just the derivative of It's just in the reverse order. So let me factor out a negative sign in order to let me switch that order here. So this becomes f of x plus h minus f of x over h, and then I've got the times one over f of x plus h times f of x. Now I can split this limit up first, I'll factor out the negative sign. And then I'll write this product as a product of two limits, which I can do provided the component limits exist. And I'll check that these limits do exist. Let's see the first limit here. The first limit here is just the derivative of f. f. And the second limit here exists because f is continuous, f is continuous since is differentiable. So by continuity, as H is going to zero, since x plus h is approaching x, f of x plus h is just approaching f of x. And I can rewrite this limit as one over f of x times f of x. And so this is in other words, negative the derivative of f of x divided by f of x squared. Now we've proved the reciprocal rule. Now we're in a great position to prove the quotient rule with very little effort. So instead of going back to the definition of derivative, this time, I'm just gonna think of the quotient f of x over g of x as a product of f of x times the reciprocal And the second limit here exists because f is continuous, f is continuous since is differentiable. So by continuity, as H is going to zero, since x plus h is approaching x, f of x plus h is just approaching f of x. And I can rewrite this limit as one over f of x times f of x. And so this is in other words, negative the derivative of f of x divided by f of x squared. Now we've proved the reciprocal rule. Now we're in a great position to prove the quotient rule with very little effort. So instead of going back to the definition of derivative, this time, I'm just gonna think of the quotient f of x over g of x as a product of f of x times the reciprocal of g of x. of g of x. And now, by the product rule, that's just the first function times the derivative of the second plus the derivative of the first times the second. And by the quotient rule, the derivative of this reciprocal is negative derivative of g over g of x squared. And I still have this second term here, which I'm just going to write as derivative f of x divided by g of x. And now, by the product rule, that's just the first function times the derivative of the second plus the derivative of the first times the second. And by the quotient rule, the derivative of this reciprocal is negative derivative of g over g of x squared. And I still have this second term here, which I'm just going to write as derivative f of x divided by g of x. Okay, Okay, so we're almost there. If we combine these two fractions, using a common denominator of g of x squared, we just have to multiply this second fraction by g of x over g of x to get that common denominator. Now we get negative f of x times the derivative of g of x plus the derivative of f of x times g of x divided by g of x squared. And hopefully, this bottom expression is the same as this top expression. And, yes, after rearranging the terms it is. So that's the end of the proof of the quotient rule. So this video gave proofs of the product rule, the reciprocal rule, and then the quotient rule. This video is about two limits involving trig functions that turn out to be very useful. Namely, the limit as theta goes to zero of sine theta so we're almost there. If we combine these two fractions, using a common denominator of g of x squared, we just have to multiply this second fraction by g of x over g of x to get that common denominator. Now we get negative f of x times the derivative of g of x plus the derivative of f of x times g of x divided by g of x squared. And hopefully, this bottom expression is the same as this top expression. And, yes, after rearranging the terms it is. So that's the end of the proof of the quotient rule. So this video gave proofs of the product rule, the reciprocal rule, and then the quotient rule. This video is about two limits involving trig functions that turn out to be very useful. Namely, the limit as theta goes to zero of sine theta over theta. And the limit as theta goes to zero of cosine theta minus one over theta. These limits turn out to have really nice simple answers, as long as we keep theta in radians, over theta. And the limit as theta goes to zero of cosine theta minus one over theta. These limits turn out to have really nice simple answers, as long as we keep theta in radians, not degrees. Let's consider the limit on the left first, that's the limit as theta goes to zero of sine theta over theta. Notice that we can't just evaluate this limit by plugging in zero for theta, because as theta goes to zero sine theta, and the numerator also goes to zero, and theta itself goes to zero, so we end up with a zero over zero indeterminate form. We can however, build up some evidence of what this limit by might be by using a calculator and a table of values, or by looking at a graph. So here's the theta axis. And here's the y axis. And you can see that as theta goes to zero from either the right or the left, it's looking like the y value is going to one. The second limit here on the right, is also zero over zero and determinant form. Since as theta goes to zero, cosine theta goes to one, so cosine theta minus one goes to zero. But again, looking at the graph, we have some evidence to suggest that as theta goes to zero, our expression is also going to not degrees. Let's consider the limit on the left first, that's the limit as theta goes to zero of sine theta over theta. Notice that we can't just evaluate this limit by plugging in zero for theta, because as theta goes to zero sine theta, and the numerator also goes to zero, and theta itself goes to zero, so we end up with a zero over zero indeterminate form. We can however, build up some evidence of what this limit by might be by using a calculator and a table of values, or by looking at a graph. So here's the theta axis. And here's the y axis. And you can see that as theta goes to zero from either the right or the left, it's looking like the y value is going to one. The second limit here on the right, is also zero over zero and determinant form. Since as theta goes to zero, cosine theta goes to one, so cosine theta minus one goes to zero. But again, looking at the graph, we have some evidence to suggest that as theta goes to zero, our expression is also going to zero. zero. these graphs provide strong evidence, but graphs can be misleading, and they're no substitute for a rigorous proof. So for a pretty cool geometric and algebraic proof of these facts, please see the proof video for this section. The fact that the limit as theta goes to zero of sine theta over theta is one is really handy when you want to approximate sine theta. Because intuitively, this is saying that sine theta is approximately equal to theta itself when theta is near zero, because the ratio is approximately one. So if I want to approximate sine of this value of theta, without a calculator, I can use that fact. And say that the sine of 0.01769 is going to be approximately equal to 0.01769. This is an important time to remind you that when we're doing these limits, we're assuming that theta is in radians. If it's not in radians, we won't get this nice limit of one here. So that's our approximation. And we can check it on a calculator, and I actually get an exact value of this number up to 10 decimal places. So as you can see, this is a really good approximation. We can use this same limit fat, again, in the next example, to calculate this complicated limit as x goes to zero, the limit of tan of 7x over sine of forex. So when I see tangents and signs and expression, I'm always tempted to rewrite things. And just in terms of sine and cosine, so I'm going to do that first I'm going to rewrite tangent as as sine over cosine. That still divided by sine of forex, and now I'm going to flip and multiply to get sine of 7x over cosine of 7x times one over sine of 4x. Now intuitively, if x is near zero, therefore 7x and 4x are also near zero, then sine of 7x is approximately equal to 7x. And sine of 4x is approximately equal to 4x. So intuitively, this limit should be pretty much the same thing as the limit as x goes to zero of 7x over cosine 7x times 4x. And canceling the access, this is just the same as seven fourths times the limit of one of our cosine 7x. Since cosine of 7x is going to one, this should just be seven fourths. So this is the intuitive approach, let me also give you a more rigorous approach. So more rigorously, I'm going to rewrite this limit by multiplying by 7x over 7x. And by multiplying by 4x, over 4x, that hasn't changed my expression, I'm just multiplying by one and fancy forms. But this is really useful. Because if I regroup here, and write the sine 7x over the 7x, times the one over cosine 7x. Now I'm going to write the Forex over the sign for x. And I'm still left with a 7x from the top and a 4x. From the bottom here, I can cancel out those x's. And I can notice that this limit here, as x goes to 07, x is going to zero, so sine 7x over 7x is just going to be equal to one. And similarly as x goes to zero, for x is going to zero. So the limit of 4x ever signed for x is the reciprocal of one, it's also one. And finally, this limit in the middle here, as x goes to 07, x is going to zero, so cosine of 7x is going to one, and everything in the world is going to one except the 7/4. So this limit is seven forth. these graphs provide strong evidence, but graphs can be misleading, and they're no substitute for a rigorous proof.

So this limit is seven forth. In this video, we found that the limit as theta goes to zero of sine theta over theta is equal to one. And the limit as theta goes to zero of cosine theta minus one over theta is equal to zero. There's a nice proof of these facts in a later video for this section. When you compose two functions, you apply the first function. And then you apply the second function to the output of the first function. For example, the first function might compute population size from time in years. In this video, we found that the limit as theta goes to zero of sine theta over theta is equal to one. And the limit as theta goes to zero of cosine theta minus one over theta is equal to zero. There's a nice proof of these facts in a later video for this section. When you compose two functions, you apply the first function. And then you apply the second function to the output of the first function. For example, the first function might compute population size from time in years. So its input would be time in years, since a certain date, as output would be number of people in the population. The second function g, might compute health care costs as a function of population size. So it will take population size as input, and its output will be healthcare costs. If you put these functions together, that is compose them, then you'll go all the way from time in years to healthcare costs. This is your composition, g composed with F. The composition of two functions, written g with a little circle, f of x is defined as follows. g composed with f of x is G evaluated on f of x, we can think of it schematically and so diagram, f acts on a number x and produces a number f of x, then g takes that output f of x and produces a new number, g of f of x. Our composition of functions g composed with F is the function that goes all the way from X to g of f of x. Let's work out some examples where our functions are defined by tables of values. If we want to find g composed with F of four, by definition, this means g of f of four. To evaluate this expression, we always work from the inside out. So we start with the x value of four, and we find f of four using the table of values for f of x. When x equals four, f of x is seven, so we can replace F of four with the number seven. Now we need to evaluate g of seven, seven becomes our new x value in our table of values for G, the x value of seven corresponds to the G of X value of 10. So g of seven is equal to 10. We found that g composed with F of four is equal to 10. If instead we want to find f composed with g of four, well, we can rewrite that is f of g of four, and again, work from the inside out. Now we're trying to find g of four, so four is our x value. And we use our table of values for G to see that g of four is one. So we replaced by a four by one, and now we need to evaluate f of one. Using our table for F values, f of one is eight. Notice that when we've computed g of f of four, we got a different answer there when we computed F of G, F four. And in general, g composed with F is not the same thing as f composed with g. So its input would be time in years, since a certain date, as output would be number of people in the population. The second function g, might compute health care costs as a function of population size. So it will take population size as input, and its output will be healthcare costs. If you put these functions together, that is compose them, then you'll go all the way from time in years to healthcare costs. This is your composition, g composed with F. The composition of two functions, written g with a little circle, f of x is defined as follows. g composed with f of x is G evaluated on f of x, we can think of it schematically and so diagram, f acts on a number x and produces a number f of x, then g takes that output f of x and produces a new number, g of f of x. Our composition of functions g composed with F is the function that goes all the way from X to g of f of x. Let's work out some examples where our functions are defined by tables of values. If we want to find g composed with F of four, by definition, this means g of f of four. To evaluate this expression, we always work from the inside out. So we start with the x value of four, and we find f of four using the table of values for f of x. When x equals four, f of x is seven, so we can replace F of four with the number seven. Now we need to evaluate g of seven, seven becomes our new x value in our table of values for G, the x value of seven corresponds to the G of X value of 10. So g of seven is equal to 10. We found that g composed with F of four is equal to 10. If instead we want to find f composed with g of four, well, we can rewrite that is f of g of four, and again, work from the inside out. Now we're trying to find g of four, so four is our x value. And we use our table of values for G to see that g of four is one. So we replaced by a four by one, and now we need to evaluate f of one. Using our table for F values, f of one is eight. Notice that when we've computed g of f of four, we got a different answer there when we computed F of G, F four. And in general, g composed with F is not the same thing as f composed with g. Please Please pause the video and take a moment to compute the next two examples. We can replace f composed with F of two by the equivalent expression, f of f of two. Working from the inside out, we know that f of two is three, and f of three is six. If we want to find f composed with g of six, rewrite that as f of g of six isn't the table for g, g of six is eight. But F of eight, eight is not on the table as an x value for the for the f function. And so there is no F of eight, this does not exist, we can say that six is not in the domain, for F composed with g. Even though it was in the domain of g, we couldn't follow all the way through and get a value for F composed with g of six. Next, let's turn our attention to the composition of functions that are given by equations. pause the video and take a moment to compute the next two examples.

Even though it was in the domain of g, we couldn't follow all the way through and get a value for F composed with g of six. Next, let's turn our attention to the composition of functions that are given by equations. p of x is x squared plus x and q of x is negative 2x. We want to find q composed with P of one. p of x is x squared plus x and q of x is negative 2x. We want to find q composed with P of one. As usual, I can rewrite this as Q of P of one and work from the inside out. P of one is one squared plus one, so that's two. So this is the same thing as Q of two. But queue of two is negative two times two or negative four. So this evaluates to negative four. In this next example, we want to find q composed with P of some arbitrary x, or rewrite it as usual as Q of p of x and work from the inside out. Well, p of x, we know the formula for that, that's x squared plus x. So I can replace my P of x with that expression. Now, I'm stuck with evaluating q on x squared plus x. Well queue of anything is negative two times that thing. So q of x squared plus x is going to be negative two times the quantity x squared plus x, what I've done is I've substituted in the whole expression x squared plus x, where I saw the X in this formula for q of x, it's important to use the parentheses here, so that we'll be multiplying negative two by the whole expression and not just by the first piece, I can simplify this a bit as negative 2x squared minus 2x. And that's my expression for Q composed with p of x. Notice that if I wanted to compute q composed with P of one, which I already did in the first problem, I could just use this expression now, negative two times one squared minus two and I get negative four, just like I did before. Let's try another one. Let's try p composed with q of x. First I read right this P of q of x. Working from the inside out, I can replace q of x with negative 2x. So I need to compute P of negative 2x. Here's my formula for P. to compute P of this expression, I need to plug in this expression everywhere I see an x in the formula for P. So that means negative 2x squared plus negative 2x. Again, being careful to use parentheses to make sure I plug in the entire expression in for x. let me simplify. This is 4x squared minus 2x. Notice that I got different expressions for Q of p of x. And for P of q of x. Once again, we see that q composed with P is not necessarily equal to P composed with Q. Please pause the video and try this last example yourself rewriting and working from the inside out, we're going to replace p of x with its expression x squared plus x. And then we need to evaluate p on x squared As usual, I can rewrite this as Q of P of one and work from the inside out. P of one is one squared plus one, so that's two. So this is the same thing as Q of two. But queue of two is negative two times two or negative four. So this evaluates to negative four. In this next example, we want to find q composed with P of some arbitrary x, or rewrite it as usual as Q of p of x and work from the inside out. Well, p of x, we know the formula for that, that's x squared plus x. So I can replace my P of x with that expression. Now, I'm stuck with evaluating q on x squared plus x. Well queue of anything is negative two times that thing. So q of x squared plus x is going to be negative two times the quantity x squared plus x, what I've done is I've substituted in the whole expression x squared plus x, where I saw the X in this formula for q of x, it's important to use the parentheses here, so that we'll be multiplying negative two by the whole expression and not just by the first piece, I can simplify this a bit as negative 2x squared minus 2x. And that's my expression for Q composed with p of x. Notice that if I wanted to compute q composed with P of one, which I already did in the first problem, I could just use this expression now, negative two times one squared minus two and I get negative four, just like I did before. Let's try another one. Let's try p composed with q of x. First I read right this P of q of x. Working from the inside out, I can replace q of x with negative 2x. So I need to compute P of negative 2x. Here's my formula for P. to compute P of this expression, I need to plug in this expression everywhere I see an x in the formula for P. So that means negative 2x squared plus negative 2x. Again, being careful to use parentheses to make sure I plug in the entire expression in for x. let me simplify. This is 4x squared minus 2x. Notice that I got different expressions for Q of p of x. And for P of q of x. Once again, we see that q composed with P is not necessarily equal to P composed with Q. Please pause the video and try this last example yourself rewriting and working from the inside out, we're going to replace p of x with its expression x squared plus x. And then we need to evaluate p on x squared plus x. plus x. That means we plug in That means we plug in x squared plus x, x squared plus x, everywhere we see an x in this formula, so that's x squared plus x quantity squared plus x squared plus x. Once again, I can simplify by distributing out, that gives me x to the fourth plus 2x cubed plus x squared plus x squared plus x, or x to the fourth plus 2x cubed plus 2x squared plus x. In this last set of examples, we're asked to go backwards, we're given a formula for a function of h of x. But we're supposed to rewrite h of x as a composition of two functions, F and G. Let's think for a minute, which of these two functions gets applied first, f composed with g of x, let's see, that means f of g of x. And since we evaluate these expressions from the inside out, we must be applying g first, and then F. In order to figure out what what f and g could be, I like to draw a box around some thing inside my expression for H, so I'm going to draw a box around x squared plus seven, then whatever's inside the box, that'll be my function, g of x, the first function that gets applied, whatever happens to the box, in this case, taking the square root sign, that becomes my outside function, my second function f. So here, we're gonna say g of x is equal to x squared plus seven, and f of x is equal to the square root of x, let's just check and make sure that this works. So I need to check that when I take the composition, f composed with g, I need to get the same thing as my original h. So let's see, if I do f composed with g of x, well, by definition, that's f of g of x. everywhere we see an x in this formula, so that's x squared plus x quantity squared plus x squared plus x. Once again, I can simplify by distributing out, that gives me x to the fourth plus 2x cubed plus x squared plus x squared plus x, or x to the fourth plus 2x cubed plus 2x squared plus x. In this last set of examples, we're asked to go backwards, we're given a formula for a function of h of x. But we're supposed to rewrite h of x as a composition of two functions, F and G. Let's think for a minute, which of these two functions gets applied first, f composed with g of x, let's see, that means f of g of x.

So here, we're gonna say g of x is equal to x squared plus seven, and f of x is equal to the square root of x, let's just check and make sure that this works. So I need to check that when I take the composition, f composed with g, I need to get the same thing as my original h. So let's see, if I do f composed with g of x, well, by definition, that's f of g of x. Working from the inside out, I can replace g of x with its formula x squared plus seven. So I need to evaluate f of x squared plus seven. That means I plug in x squared plus seven, into the formula for for F. So that becomes the square root of x squared plus seven, two, it works because it matches my original equation. So we found a correct answer a correct way of breaking h down as a composition of two functions. But I do want to point out, this is not the only correct answer. I'll write down my formula for H of X again, and this time, I'll put the box in a different place, I'll just box the x squared. If I did that, then my inside function, my first function, g of x would be x squared. And my second function is what happens Working from the inside out, I can replace g of x with its formula x squared plus seven. So I need to evaluate f of x squared plus seven. That means I plug in x squared plus seven, into the formula for for F. So that becomes the square root of x squared plus seven, two, it works because it matches my original equation. So we found a correct answer a correct way of breaking h down as a composition of two functions. But I do want to point out, this is not the only correct answer. I'll write down my formula for H of X again, and this time, I'll put the box in a different place, I'll just box the x squared. If I did that, then my inside function, my first function, g of x would be x squared. And my second function is what happens to the box. to the box. So my f of x is what happens to the box, and the box gets added seven to it, and taking the square root. So in other words, f of x is going to be the square root of x plus seven. Again, I can check that this works. If I do f composed with g of x, that's f So my f of x is what happens to the box, and the box gets added seven to it, and taking the square root. So in other words, f of x is going to be the square root of x plus seven. Again, I can check that this works. If I do f composed with g of x, that's f of g of x. of g of x. So now g of x is x squared, so I'm taking f of x squared. When I plug in x squared for x, I do in fact get the square root of x squared plus seven. So this is an alternative correct solution. In this video, we learn to evaluate the composition of functions. by rewriting it and working from the inside out. We also learn to break apart a complicated function into a composition of two functions by boxing one piece of the function and letting the first function applied in the composition. Let that be the inside of the box and the second function applied in the composition be whatever happens to the box. So now g of x is x squared, so I'm taking f of x squared. When I plug in x squared for x, I do in fact get the square root of x squared plus seven. So this is an alternative correct solution. In this video, we learn to evaluate the composition of functions. by rewriting it and working from the inside out. We also learn to break apart a complicated function into a composition of two functions by boxing one piece of the function and letting the first function applied in the composition. Let that be the inside of the box and the second function applied in the composition be whatever happens to the box. This video is about solving rational equations. A rational equation like this one equation that has rational expressions and that, in other words, an equation that has some variables in the denominator. There are several different approaches for solving a rational equation, but they all start by finding the least common denominator. In this example, the denominators are x plus three and x, we can think of one as just having a denominator of one. Since the denominators don't have any factors in common, I can find the least common denominator just by multiplying them together. My next step is going to be clearing the denominator. By this, I mean that I multiply both sides of my equation by this least common denominator, x plus three times x, I multiply on the left side of the equation, and I multiply by the same thing on the right side of the equation. Since I'm doing the same thing to both sides of the equation, I don't change the the value of the equation. Multiplying the least common denominator on both sides of the equation is equivalent to multiplying it by all three terms in the equation, I can see this when I multiply out, I'll rewrite the left side the same as before, pretty much. And then I'll distribute the right side to get x plus three times x times one plus x plus three times x times one over x. So I've actually multiplied the least common denominator by all three terms of my equation. Now I can have a blast canceling things. The x plus three cancels with the x plus three on the denominator. The here are nothing cancels out because there's no denominator, and here are the x in the numerator cancels with the x in the denominator. So I can rewrite my expression as x squared equals x plus three times x times one plus x plus three. Now I'm going to simplify. So I'll leave the x squared alone on this side, I'll distribute out x squared plus 3x plus x plus three, hey, look, the x squared is cancel on both sides. And so I get zero equals 4x plus three, so 4x is negative three, and x is negative three fourths. Finally, I'm going to plug in my answer to check. This is a good idea for any kind of equation. But it's especially important for a rational equation because occasionally for rational equations, you'll get what's called extraneous solution solutions that don't actually work in your original equation because they make the denominator zero. Now, in this example, I don't think we're going to get the extraneous equations, because negative three fourths is not going to make any of these denominators zero, so it should work out fine when I plug in. If I plug in, I get this, I can simplify the denominator here, negative three fourths plus three, three is 12, for sets becomes nine fourths, and this is one or flip and multiply to get minus four thirds. So here, I can simplify my complex fraction, it ends up being negative three nights, and one minus four thirds is negative 1/3. So that all seems to check out. And so my final answer is x equals negative three fourths. This next example looks a little trickier. And it is, but the same approach will work. First off, find the least common denominator. So here, my denominators are c minus five, c plus one, and C squared minus four c minus five, I'm going to factor that as C minus five times c plus one. Now, my least common denominator needs to have just enough factors to that each of these denominators divided into it. So I need the factor c minus five, I need the factor c plus one. And now I've already got all the factors I need for this denominator. So here is my least common denominator. Next step is to clear the denominators. So I do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by my least common denominator. In fact, I can just multiply each of the three terms by this least common denominator. I went ahead and wrote my third denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what cancels. Now canceling time dies, this dies, and both of those factors die. This video is about solving rational equations. A rational equation like this one equation that has rational expressions and that, in other words, an equation that has some variables in the denominator. There are several different approaches for solving a rational equation, but they all start by finding the least common denominator.

So I've actually multiplied the least common denominator by all three terms of my equation. Now I can have a blast canceling things. The x plus three cancels with the x plus three on the denominator. The here are nothing cancels out because there's no denominator, and here are the x in the numerator cancels with the x in the denominator. So I can rewrite my expression as x squared equals x plus three times x times one plus x plus three. Now I'm going to simplify. So I'll leave the x squared alone on this side, I'll distribute out x squared plus 3x plus x plus three, hey, look, the x squared is cancel on both sides. And so I get zero equals 4x plus three, so 4x is negative three, and x is negative three fourths. Finally, I'm going to plug in my answer to check. This is a good idea for any kind of equation. But it's especially important for a rational equation because occasionally for rational equations, you'll get what's called extraneous solution solutions that don't actually work in your original equation because they make the denominator zero.

So here, my denominators are c minus five, c plus one, and C squared minus four c minus five, I'm going to factor that as C minus five times c plus one. Now, my least common denominator needs to have just enough factors to that each of these denominators divided into it. So I need the factor c minus five, I need the factor c plus one. And now I've already got all the factors I need for this denominator. So here is my least common denominator. Next step is to clear the denominators. So I do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by my least common denominator. In fact, I can just multiply each of the three terms by this least common denominator. I went ahead and wrote my third denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what cancels. Now canceling time dies, this dies, and both of those factors die. cancel out the denominators, the whole point of multiplying by the least common denominator, you're multiplying by something that's big enough to kill every single denominator so you don't have to deal with denominators anymore. Now I'm going to simplify by multiplying out. So I get, let's see, c plus one times four c, that's four c squared plus four c, now I get minus just c minus five, and then over here, I get three c squared plus three, I can rewrite the minus quantity c minus five as a minus c plus five. And now I can subtract the three c squared from both sides to get just a C squared over here, and the four c minus c, that becomes a three C. And finally, I can subtract the three from both sides to get c squared plus three c plus two equals zero. got myself a quadratic equation that looks like a nice one that factors. So this factors to C plus one times c plus two equals zero. So either c plus one is zero, or C plus two is zero, so C equals negative one, or C equals negative two. Now let's see, we need to still check our answers. Without even going to the trouble of calculating anything, I can see that C equals negative one is not going to work, because if I plug it in to this denominator here, I get a denominator of zero, which doesn't make sense. So C equals minus one is an extraneous solution, it doesn't actually satisfy my original equation. And so I can just cross it right out, C equals negative two. I can go if I go ahead, and that doesn't make any of my denominators zero. So if I haven't made any mistakes, it should satisfy my original equation, but, but I'll just plug it in to be sure. And after some simplifying, I get a true statement. So my final answer is C equals negative two. In this video, we solved a couple of rational equations, using the method of finding the least common denominator, and then clearing the denominator, we cleared the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator or equivalently. multiplying each of the terms by that denominator. There's another equivalent method that some people prefer, it still starts out the same, we find the least common denominator, but then we write all the fractions over that least common denominator. So in this example, we'd still use the least common denominator of x plus three times x. cancel out the denominators, the whole point of multiplying by the least common denominator, you're multiplying by something that's big enough to kill every single denominator so you don't have to deal with denominators anymore. Now I'm going to simplify by multiplying out. So I get, let's see, c plus one times four c, that's four c squared plus four c, now I get minus just c minus five, and then over here, I get three c squared plus three, I can rewrite the minus quantity c minus five as a minus c plus five. And now I can subtract the three c squared from both sides to get just a C squared over here, and the four c minus c, that becomes a three C. And finally, I can subtract the three from both sides to get c squared plus three c plus two equals zero. got myself a quadratic equation that looks like a nice one that factors. So this factors to C plus one times c plus two equals zero. So either c plus one is zero, or C plus two is zero, so C equals negative one, or C equals negative two. Now let's see, we need to still check our answers. Without even going to the trouble of calculating anything, I can see that C equals negative one is not going to work, because if I plug it in to this denominator here, I get a denominator of zero, which doesn't make sense. So C equals minus one is an extraneous solution, it doesn't actually satisfy my original equation. And so I can just cross it right out, C equals negative two. I can go if I go ahead, and that doesn't make any of my denominators zero. So if I haven't made any mistakes, it should satisfy my original equation, but, but I'll just plug it in to be sure. And after some simplifying, I get a true statement. So my final answer is C equals negative two. In this video, we solved a couple of rational equations, using the method of finding the least common denominator, and then clearing the denominator, we cleared the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator or equivalently. multiplying each of the terms by that denominator. There's another equivalent method that some people prefer, it still starts out the same, we find the least common denominator, but then we write all the fractions over that least common denominator. So in this example, we'd still use the least common denominator of x plus three times x. But our next step would be to write each of these rational expressions over that common denominator by multiplying the top and the bottom by the appropriate things. So one, in order to get the common denominator of x plus 3x, I need to multiply the top and the bottom by x plus three times x, whenever x, I need to multiply the top and the bottom just by x plus three since that's what's missing from the denominator x. Now, if I simplify a little bit, let's say this is x squared over that common denominator, and here I have just x plus three times x over that denominator, and here I have x plus three over that common denominator. Now add together my fractions on the right side, so they have a common denominator. So this is x plus three times x plus x plus three. And now I have two fractions that have that are equal, that have the same denominator, therefore, their numerators have to be equal also. So the next step is to set the numerators equal. So I get x squared is x plus three times x plus x plus three. And if you look back at the previous way, we solve this equation, you'll recognize this equation. And so from here on we just continue as before. When choosing between these two methods, I personally tend to prefer the clear the denominators method, because it's a little bit less writing, you don't have to get rid of those denominators earlier. You don't have to write them as many times, but some people find this one a little bit easier to remember, a little easier to understand either of these methods is fine. One last caution. Don't forget at the end, to check your solutions and eliminate any extraneous solutions. These will be solutions that make the denominators of your original equation. Go to zero. This video gives the derivative of sine cosine and other trig functions. A graph of the function y equals sine x is given in blue here, we can estimate the shape of the derivative of sine x by looking at the slopes of the tangent lines. Here, when x equals zero, the tangent line has a positive slope of approximately one. As x increases to pi over two, the slope of the tangent line is still positive, but decreases to zero. Next, the slope turns negative more and more negative reaching a negative value of negative one, before returning again to zero. Continuing like this, we see that the graph of the derivative y equals sine prime of x looks like the graph of y equals cosine x below. Please pause the video and do a similar exercise for the graph of y equals cosine of x below, that is use the graph of y equals cosine x to estimate the shape of the graph of y equals cosine prime of x. Notice that when x equals zero, the slope of the tangent line here is zero, that slope turns negative, and then reaches zero again before turning positive. So the graph of the derivative should look something like this. This new blue graph looks like the vertical reflection of the blue graph above suggesting that the derivative of cosine of x is equal to the negative of sine of x. So we have graphical evidence that the derivative of sine x is equal to cosine of x, and the derivative of cosine of x is equal to negative sine of x. For proofs of these facts, please see the separate proof video for this section. Once we have the derivatives of sine and cosine, we have the power to compute the derivatives of a lot of other trig functions as well. But our next step would be to write each of these rational expressions over that common denominator by multiplying the top and the bottom by the appropriate things. So one, in order to get the common denominator of x plus 3x, I need to multiply the top and the bottom by x plus three times x, whenever x, I need to multiply the top and the bottom just by x plus three since that's what's missing from the denominator x. Now, if I simplify a little bit, let's say this is x squared over that common denominator, and here I have just x plus three times x over that denominator, and here I have x plus three over that common denominator. Now add together my fractions on the right side, so they have a common denominator. So this is x plus three times x plus x plus three. And now I have two fractions that have that are equal, that have the same denominator, therefore, their numerators have to be equal also. So the next step is to set the numerators equal. So I get x squared is x plus three times x plus x plus three. And if you look back at the previous way, we solve this equation, you'll recognize this equation. And so from here on we just continue as before.

Once we have the derivatives of sine and cosine, we have the power to compute the derivatives of a lot of other trig functions as well. And notice that a nice way to remember which of these answers have negative signs in them is that the derivatives of the trig functions that start with a co And notice that a nice way to remember which of these answers have negative signs in them is that the derivatives of the trig functions that start with a co always have a negative, and the root of the trig functions that don't have the ko are positive. Now let's use these formulas in an example. g of x is a complicated expression involving several trig functions as well as a constant m, and I have a couple choices of how to proceed. I could try to rewrite all my trig functions in terms of sine and cosine and simplify, or I could attack the derivative directly using the quotient rule. I'm going to use the direct approach In this case, but sometimes you'll find that rewriting will make things easier. So using the quotient rule on the denominator, I get the original denominator squared. On the numerator, I get low D high to compute the derivative of x cosine x, I need the product rule. So I get x times the derivative of cosine, which is negative sine x, plus the derivative of x, which is just one times cosine of x. Now I have to do a minus Hi, x cosine of x dillow. The derivative of M is just zero because M is a constant, plus the derivative of cotangent which is negative cosecant squared of x. So I found the derivative, I'm going to go ahead and simplify a little bit by multiplying out then rewriting everything in terms of sine and cosine, and then multiplying the numerator and denominator by sine squared of x, we have a somewhat simplified expression for the derivative, you should memorize the derivatives of the trig functions will prove that the first two formulas are correct in a separate proof video. In this video, I'll give proofs for the two special trig limit. And I'll also prove that the derivative of sine is cosine. And the derivative of cosine is minus sign. To prove that the limit of sine that over theta is one as theta goes to zero, I'm going to start with a picture. In this picture, I have a unit circle a circle of radius one, and I have two right triangles, a green triangle and a smaller red triangle, both with angle theta. Now I'm going to argue in terms of areas, if I want to compute the area of this sector that I've shaded in blue here, in other words, that pie shaped piece, I can first compute the area of the circle, which is pi times one squared for the radius. But since the sector has angle theta, and the full circle has angle two pi, I need to multiply that area of the circle by the ratio theta over two pi to represent the fraction of the area of the circle that's included in this sector. So in other words, the area of the sector is just going to be theta over two, where theta is given in the radians. Now if I want to compute the area of the little red triangle, I can do one half times the base times the height. Now the base is going to be equal to cosine theta, because I have a circle of radius one angle theta here, and the height is going to be sine theta. Finally, the area of the green triangle is also one half times the base times the height. But now the base is a full one unit, and the height is given by tangent theta, since opposite, which is the height here over adjacent, which is one has to equal tangent theta. Now if I put all those areas together, I know that the area of the red triangle, alright is cosine theta sine theta over two has to be less than or equal to the area of the blue sector, theta over two, which is less than or equal to the area of the big green triangle, which is tan theta over two. Now I'm going to multiply through this inequality by two and rewrite things in terms of sine and cosine to get cosine theta sine theta is less than or equal to theta is less than or equal to sine theta over cosine theta. Now I'm going to divide through my inequalities by sine theta, which won't change the inequalities as long as theta is greater than zero, so that sine theta is positive. always have a negative, and the root of the trig functions that don't have the ko are positive. Now let's use these formulas in an example. g of x is a complicated expression involving several trig functions as well as a constant m, and I have a couple choices of how to proceed. I could try to rewrite all my trig functions in terms of sine and cosine and simplify, or I could attack the derivative directly using the quotient rule.

The derivative of M is just zero because M is a constant, plus the derivative of cotangent which is negative cosecant squared of x.

So in other words, the area of the sector is just going to be theta over two, where theta is given in the radians. Now if I want to compute the area of the little red triangle, I can do one half times the base times the height. Now the base is going to be equal to cosine theta, because I have a circle of radius one angle theta here, and the height is going to be sine theta. Finally, the area of the green triangle is also one half times the base times the height. But now the base is a full one unit, and the height is given by tangent theta, since opposite, which is the height here over adjacent, which is one has to equal tangent theta. Now if I put all those areas together, I know that the area of the red triangle, alright is cosine theta sine theta over two has to be less than or equal to the area of the blue sector, theta over two, which is less than or equal to the area of the big green triangle, which is tan theta over two. Now I'm going to multiply through this inequality by two and rewrite things in terms of sine and cosine to get cosine theta sine theta is less than or equal to theta is less than or equal to sine theta over cosine theta. Now I'm going to divide through my inequalities by sine theta, which won't change the inequalities as long as theta is greater than zero, so that sine theta is positive. And I get cosine theta is less than or equal to theta over sine theta is less than or equal to one over cosine theta. Now this middle expression is the reciprocal of the expression I want to take the limit of. So I'm going to go ahead and take limits. And since the limits of the two expressions on the outside, both exist, and equal one by the sandwich theorem, the limit of the expression on the inside has to exist an equal one as well. Now I've cheated a little bit here. And I've really just taken the limit from the right because I've assumed that theta is greater than zero. But you can check that if you say that less than zero, so that sign that as negative, the limit from the left will also equal one, the inequalities will flip around first, but you'll still get it use the sandwich theorem to get a limit of one. And that's a cool geometric proof of this useful limit from calculus. To show that the limit of cosine theta minus one over theta is zero, we can actually rewrite this expression and reuse the limit that we just computed. So let me write down my limit. And I'm going to multiply this expression by cosine theta plus one on the numerator and the denominator. So I haven't changed the expression, I'm just multiply that by one. Now, if I multiply my numerator out, And I get cosine theta is less than or equal to theta over sine theta is less than or equal to one over cosine theta. Now this middle expression is the reciprocal of the expression I want to take the limit of. So I'm going to go ahead and take limits. And since the limits of the two expressions on the outside, both exist, and equal one by the sandwich theorem, the limit of the expression on the inside has to exist an equal one as well. Now I've cheated a little bit here. And I've really just taken the limit from the right because I've assumed that theta is greater than zero. But you can check that if you say that less than zero, so that sign that as negative, the limit from the left will also equal one, the inequalities will flip around first, but you'll still get it use the sandwich theorem to get a limit of one. And that's a cool geometric proof of this useful limit from calculus. To show that the limit of cosine theta minus one over theta is zero, we can actually rewrite this expression and reuse the limit that we just computed. So let me write down my limit. And I'm going to multiply this expression by cosine theta plus one on the numerator and the denominator. So I haven't changed the expression, I'm just multiply that by one. Now, if I multiply my numerator out, I get cosine squared theta minus one. And from the trig identity, sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta equals one, I know that cosine squared theta minus one has to equal minus sine squared. So I can rewrite my limit as the limit of minus sine squared theta over theta cosine theta plus one. And now I can regroup to write my sine theta over theta, and my other copy of sine theta over cosine theta plus one, the limit of the first expression is going to be negative one, because of the limit we just proved. And the limit of the second expression is just zero over one plus one, or zero, and therefore, my entire limit is just going to be negative one times zero, or zero, which is exactly what we want it to prove. Now we can use these two limits that we've just proved to calculate the derivatives of sine and cosine, using the limit definition of derivative and prove the results that were stated previously. According to the limit definition of derivative, the derivative of sine x is the limit as h goes to zero of sine of x plus h minus sine of x divided by H. As usual, this is a zero for zero indeterminate form limits. So I'm going to need to rewrite things to evaluate it. And I'm going to rewrite using the angle sum formula for sine, the sine of x plus h is equal to sine x cosine H, cosine plus cosine x sine H. Now if I rearrange things, and factor out a sine x from the first term, I can break up my limit into pieces and compute every piece. So this is sine x times zero plus cosine x times one. And so my final answer is cosine x as we wanted the proof that the derivative of cosine is minus sine is very similar. So please stop the video and try it for yourself before proceeding. Using the limit definition of derivative, we have that the derivative of cosine of x is the limit as h goes to zero of cosine of x plus h minus cosine of x over h, we can rewrite the cosine of x plus h using the angle sum formula as the cosine of x times the cosine of H minus the sine of x times the sine of H. And then we still have the minus cosine of x over h. As before, we're going to regroup things and factoring out the cosine x from the first part, the same familiar limits just put together in different ways. So here, cosine of x as h goes to zero is just cosine of x. This limit we know is zero. sine of x is just saying sine of x, and sine of h over h is going to one which means that our final answer is going to be negative sine of x times one or just negative sine of x, which is exactly what we wanted. That's all for the proofs of these four useful calculus facts. rectilinear motion or linear motion means the motion of an object along a straight line. For example, a particle moving left and right, or a ball going up and down. In this video, we'll see what the derivative and the second derivative tell us about the motion of an object constrained to move along a straight line. In this example, A particle is moving up and down along a straight line. And its position is given by this equation where the positive positions mean that the particle is above its Baseline Position, whatever I'm calling position zero, and negative positions mean the particle is below this Baseline Position. I'm asked to find s prime of T and S double prime of t. So by deriving I get four t cubed minus 16 t squared plus 12 T for the first derivative, and 12 t squared minus 32 t plus 12. For the second derivative, I get cosine squared theta minus one. And from the trig identity, sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta equals one, I know that cosine squared theta minus one has to equal minus sine squared. So I can rewrite my limit as the limit of minus sine squared theta over theta cosine theta plus one. And now I can regroup to write my sine theta over theta, and my other copy of sine theta over cosine theta plus one, the limit of the first expression is going to be negative one, because of the limit we just proved. And the limit of the second expression is just zero over one plus one, or zero, and therefore, my entire limit is just going to be negative one times zero, or zero, which is exactly what we want it to prove. Now we can use these two limits that we've just proved to calculate the derivatives of sine and cosine, using the limit definition of derivative and prove the results that were stated previously. According to the limit definition of derivative, the derivative of sine x is the limit as h goes to zero of sine of x plus h minus sine of x divided by H. As usual, this is a zero for zero indeterminate form limits. So I'm going to need to rewrite things to evaluate it. And I'm going to rewrite using the angle sum formula for sine, the sine of x plus h is equal to sine x cosine H, cosine plus cosine x sine H. Now if I rearrange things, and factor out a sine x from the first term, I can break up my limit into pieces and compute every piece. So this is sine x times zero plus cosine x times one. And so my final answer is cosine x as we wanted the proof that the derivative of cosine is minus sine is very similar. So please stop the video and try it for yourself before proceeding. Using the limit definition of derivative, we have that the derivative of cosine of x is the limit as h goes to zero of cosine of x plus h minus cosine of x over h, we can rewrite the cosine of x plus h using the angle sum formula as the cosine of x times the cosine of H minus the sine of x times the sine of H. And then we still have the minus cosine of x over h. As before, we're going to regroup things and factoring out the cosine x from the first part, the same familiar limits just put together in different ways. So here, cosine of x as h goes to zero is just cosine of x. This limit we know is zero. sine of x is just saying sine of x, and sine of h over h is going to one which means that our final answer is going to be negative sine of x times one or just negative sine of x, which is exactly what we wanted. That's all for the proofs of these four useful calculus facts. rectilinear motion or linear motion means the motion of an object along a straight line. For example, a particle moving left and right, or a ball going up and down. In this video, we'll see what the derivative and the second derivative tell us about the motion of an object constrained to move along a straight line. In this example, A particle is moving up and down along a straight line. And its position is given by this equation where the positive positions mean that the particle is above its Baseline Position, whatever I'm calling position zero, and negative positions mean the particle is below this Baseline Position. I'm asked to find s prime of T and S double prime of t. So by deriving I get four t cubed minus 16 t squared plus 12 T for the first derivative, and 12 t squared minus 32 t plus 12. For the second derivative, S prime of t, which can also be written, D STD represents the instantaneous rate of change of S of t, the position over time, well, the change in position over time is just the velocity. And this can also be written as v of t, s double prime of t, the second derivative of s with respect to t, can also be thought of as the derivative of the velocity function. So that represents the rate of change of velocity over time, how fast the velocity is increasing or decreasing. And that is called acceleration. And it can be written as a lefty. Like position, velocity and acceleration can be both positive and negative. A positive velocity means the position is increasing. So the particle is moving up, while a negative velocity means the position is decreasing, so the particle is moving down. Of course, a velocity of zero means the particles at rest, at least for that instant. from physics, we know that force equals mass times acceleration. So if the acceleration is positive, then that means the force is in the positive direction, it's like the particle is being pulled up. If on the other hand, the acceleration is negative than the force is in the negative direction, and it's like the particle is being pulled down. an acceleration of zero means there's no force on the particle at that instant, and the velocity continues as is. Let's use these ideas about velocity acceleration. And the following table of values to describe the particles motion at time equals 1.5 seconds. At time 1.5 seconds, the position of the particle is positive, so that means the particle is above its Baseline Position of zero. its velocity is negative, so that means that its position is decreasing. In other words, the particle is moving down. Its acceleration is negative acceleration is the derivative of velocity. So a negative acceleration means the velocity is decreasing. Well, a negative velocity that's decreasing is getting more and more negative. So in fact, the particle is moving down faster and faster. This can be a little bit confusing, because even though the velocity is decreasing, it's getting more and more negative, the speed, which is the absolute value of velocity is increasing. We can also see what the particle is doing at 1.5 seconds by looking at this graph, where the time is drawn on the x axis and position s of t is on the y axis. From the graph, we can see that when t is zero, S of t is also zero. So the particle starts at its Baseline Position of zero. At time 1.5 seconds, the particle is above this starting position, but moving downwards. And since the slope of this graph is getting steeper and steeper, we can conclude that the speed of the particle is increasing. Same thing was we concluded from the table of values. Now let's do the same analysis when time is 2.5 seconds. s of 2.5 seconds is negative. So the particle is below its starting position. Velocity s prime of t is also negative. So the particle is still going down. But now the acceleration as double prime of t is positive. That means that the velocity Today is increasing, well, a negative velocity that's increasing is getting less negative closer to zero. So the particle must be slowing down. And in fact, the speed is decreasing. Again, the graph agrees with this reasoning, at 2.5 seconds, our position is way down here, our graph is decreasing, so the particles moving down, and the slope seems to be leveling off. So the particle speed is decreasing. Even though it's velocity, S prime of t, which can also be written, D STD represents the instantaneous rate of change of S of t, the position over time, well, the change in position over time is just the velocity. And this can also be written as v of t, s double prime of t, the second derivative of s with respect to t, can also be thought of as the derivative of the velocity function. So that represents the rate of change of velocity over time, how fast the velocity is increasing or decreasing. And that is called acceleration. And it can be written as a lefty. Like position, velocity and acceleration can be both positive and negative. A positive velocity means the position is increasing. So the particle is moving up, while a negative velocity means the position is decreasing, so the particle is moving down. Of course, a velocity of zero means the particles at rest, at least for that instant. from physics, we know that force equals mass times acceleration. So if the acceleration is positive, then that means the force is in the positive direction, it's like the particle is being pulled up. If on the other hand, the acceleration is negative than the force is in the negative direction, and it's like the particle is being pulled down. an acceleration of zero means there's no force on the particle at that instant, and the velocity continues as is. Let's use these ideas about velocity acceleration. And the following table of values to describe the particles motion at time equals 1.5 seconds. At time 1.5 seconds, the position of the particle is positive, so that means the particle is above its Baseline Position of zero. its velocity is negative, so that means that its position is decreasing. In other words, the particle is moving down. Its acceleration is negative acceleration is the derivative of velocity. So a negative acceleration means the velocity is decreasing. Well, a negative velocity that's decreasing is getting more and more negative. So in fact, the particle is moving down faster and faster. This can be a little bit confusing, because even though the velocity is decreasing, it's getting more and more negative, the speed, which is the absolute value of velocity is increasing. We can also see what the particle is doing at 1.5 seconds by looking at this graph, where the time is drawn on the x axis and position s of t is on the y axis. From the graph, we can see that when t is zero, S of t is also zero. So the particle starts at its Baseline Position of zero. At time 1.5 seconds, the particle is above this starting position, but moving downwards. And since the slope of this graph is getting steeper and steeper, we can conclude that the speed of the particle is increasing. Same thing was we concluded from the table of values. Now let's do the same analysis when time is 2.5 seconds. s of 2.5 seconds is negative. So the particle is below its starting position. Velocity s prime of t is also negative. So the particle is still going down. But now the acceleration as double prime of t is positive. That means that the velocity Today is increasing, well, a negative velocity that's increasing is getting less negative closer to zero. So the particle must be slowing down. And in fact, the speed is decreasing. Again, the graph agrees with this reasoning, at 2.5 seconds, our position is way down here, our graph is decreasing, so the particles moving down, and the slope seems to be leveling off. So the particle speed is decreasing. Even though it's velocity, which you can think of as speed with direction is increasing, simply because it's a negative velocity that's getting less negative. Notice that in the first example, when velocity and acceleration are both in the same direction, that is, they're both negative the particle was speeding up. And the second example, were velocity and acceleration when the opposite directions one positive one negative, the particle is slowing down. which you can think of as speed with direction is increasing, simply because it's a negative velocity that's getting less negative. Notice that in the first example, when velocity and acceleration are both in the same direction, that is, they're both negative the particle was speeding up. And the second example, were velocity and acceleration when the opposite directions one positive one negative, the particle is slowing down. This is true in general, when velocity acceleration had the same sign, that as they're both positive or both negative, then the particle is speeding up. This is true in general, when velocity acceleration had the same sign, that as they're both positive or both negative, then the particle is speeding up. And when velocity acceleration have opposite signs, then the particle is slowing down. One way to think about this is in terms of force, forces in the same direction as acceleration. So if velocity acceleration have the same sign, that means force is the same direction as the particles already going, so it's making the particle speed up. But if velocity and acceleration have opposite signs, then the force is going against the way that particles moving, so it's causing it to slow down. Let's continue the same example with some more questions, it'll be helpful to write down the velocity and acceleration functions that we calculated earlier. I've also graphed position, velocity and acceleration here at the right. And before you go on, it's a fun exercise to figure out which one is which, without even looking at the equations just based on the shapes of the graphs. And where they're increasing where they're decreasing where they're positive and where they're negative. Velocity is the derivative of position. So velocity needs to be positive, where position is increasing. The only pairs of functions that have this property are the blue one, that's positive, when the red ones increasing, and the green function, which is positive, when the blue one is increasing. Now acceleration, which is the derivative of velocity also needs to be positive, when velocity is increasing. So the only way to correctly label the functions with both of these relationships is to make the red one be position, the blue one be velocity, and the green one be acceleration. This agrees with the equations that And when velocity acceleration have opposite signs, then the particle is slowing down. One way to think about this is in terms of force, forces in the same direction as acceleration. So if velocity acceleration have the same sign, that means force is the same direction as the particles already going, so it's making the particle speed up. But if velocity and acceleration have opposite signs, then the force is going against the way that particles moving, so it's causing it to slow down. Let's continue the same example with some more questions, it'll be helpful to write down the velocity and acceleration functions that we calculated earlier. I've also graphed position, velocity and acceleration here at the right. And before you go on, it's a fun exercise to figure out which one is which, without even looking at the equations just based on the shapes of the graphs. And where they're increasing where they're decreasing where they're positive and where they're negative. Velocity is the derivative of position. So velocity needs to be positive, where position is increasing. The only pairs of functions that have this property are the blue one, that's positive, when the red ones increasing, and the green function, which is positive, when the blue one is increasing. Now acceleration, which is the derivative of velocity also needs to be positive, when velocity is increasing. So the only way to correctly label the functions with both of these relationships is to make the red one be position, the blue one be velocity, and the green one be acceleration. This agrees with the equations that we have over here. we have over here. The first question asks, When is the particle at rest, the particle is temporarily at rest when the velocity is zero. In other words, S prime of t is zero. So plugging in the equation for S prime of t, we can factor out a four T, and factor some more. To conclude the T has to be 01, or three. The first question asks, When is the particle at rest, the particle is temporarily at rest when the velocity is zero. In other words, S prime of t is zero. So plugging in the equation for S prime of t, we can factor out a four T, and factor some more. To conclude the T has to be 01, or three. This conclusion agrees with our graph of V of t, which has x intercepts at 01 and three, and also agrees with our graph of position s of t. Since the particle stops for a moment, it changed direction, when t equals 01. And three, the particle is moving up when velocity is positive, and moving down when velocity is negative. Since we know from the previous question, the velocity equals zero, when t equals 01. And three, we can look in between those values to figure out whether the velocity is positive or negative, just by plugging in values. So for example, when t is negative one, if I plug into the negative one to the equation for velocity, I get a negative number. So velocity must be negative when t is less than zero, between zero and one. If I plug in, for example, t equals one half, I get a value of S prime of t or V of t of 2.5, which is a positive number. If I plug in a value of t in between one and three, say t equals two, I get a value of v of t of negative eight, which is a negative number. And finally, if I plug in a value of t greater than three, so For, I get a positive answer for V of t. So from the sign chart, I see that V of t is negative when t is between negative infinity and zero, and in between one and three, and V of t is positive when t is between This conclusion agrees with our graph of V of t, which has x intercepts at 01 and three, and also agrees with our graph of position s of t. Since the particle stops for a moment, it changed direction, when t equals 01. And three, the particle is moving up when velocity is positive, and moving down when velocity is negative. Since we know from the previous question, the velocity equals zero, when t equals 01. And three, we can look in between those values to figure out whether the velocity is positive or negative, just by plugging in values. So for example, when t is negative one, if I plug into the negative one to the equation for velocity, I get a negative number. So velocity must be negative when t is less than zero, between zero and one. If I plug in, for example, t equals one half, I get a value of S prime of t or V of t of 2.5, which is a positive number. If I plug in a value of t in between one and three, say t equals two, I get a value of v of t of negative eight, which is a negative number. And finally, if I plug in a value of t greater than three, so For, I get a positive answer for V of t. So from the sign chart, I see that V of t is negative when t is between negative infinity and zero, and in between one and three, and V of t is positive when t is between zero and zero and one, and between three and infinity. Of course, I could have reached the same conclusion just by looking at the graph of velocity and where it's above and below the x axis, or even by looking at the graph of position and seeing where it's increasing and where it's decreasing. To answer the next question, the particle will be speeding up when V of t and a of t are both positive or both negative. And the particle will be slowing down when V of t and a of t have opposite signs. So let's make a similar sign chart to figure out where a of t is positive and negative. First, it'll be helpful to find out where a if t is zero. So if I set zero equal to my S double prime, that's 12 t squared minus 32 t plus 12, I could factor out one, and between three and infinity. Of course, I could have reached the same conclusion just by looking at the graph of velocity and where it's above and below the x axis, or even by looking at the graph of position and seeing where it's increasing and where it's decreasing. To answer the next question, the particle will be speeding up when V of t and a of t are both positive or both negative. And the particle will be slowing down when V of t and a of t have opposite signs. So let's make a similar sign chart to figure out where a of t is positive and negative. First, it'll be helpful to find out where a if t is zero. So if I set zero equal to my S double prime, that's 12 t squared minus 32 t plus 12, I could factor out a four a four and then use the quadratic equation to find the solution. Since this equation doesn't factor easily, this simplifies to four thirds plus or minus the square root of seven over three, which is approximately 0.45, and 2.22. Now I can build a similar sign chart for acceleration, mark the places where acceleration is zero. and plug in values of t, say t equals zero is the equation for acceleration, I get a positive answer here. When I plug in, say t equals one, I get a negative answer here. And when I plug in, say, t equals three, I get another positive answer here. Now, if I put this together with my velocity chart, which changed sign at 01, and three, and went from negative to positive, to negative to positive, I can try to figure out where velocity acceleration both have the same sign. It might be helpful actually to shade in where acceleration is positive. And separately shade in where velocity is positive. And then look for the places where both are shaded. So between zero and 4.5, and greater than three. And then I can also look where both are unshaded that looks like in between one and 2.22. So that's where they're both negative. And then I'll know that V of t and a of t have opposite signs everywhere else. A slightly better answer, we'll use exact values of four thirds plus or minus squared of seven thirds instead of these decimal approximations. So let me write that down. So here is where the particle speeding up. And here, it's where it's slowing down, we can check our work by looking at the graph of position, the particle speeding up with the position graph is getting steeper and steeper, that's the red graph is getting steeper and steeper here, here. And here, just like we found algebraically. As our final example, let's look at net change in position and distance traveled between one and four seconds for the same particle. At time, one second position is five thirds, or about 1.67 millimeters at time for its position is given by 32 thirds, or about 10.67 millimeters, all I'm doing is plugging one and four into this equation. So the net change in position is just the difference of these two numbers. As a four minus as of one, which is nine millimeters. At first glance, it might seem like the total distance traveled between one and four seconds should also be nine millimeters, but actually, it's a little more complicated. Because the particle switches direction during that time period, it doesn't go straight from its position at one second to its position at four seconds. Remember what the graph Position looked like the particle switches direction at one second and at three seconds. So to find the total distance, we need the distance of travels from one second to three seconds, plus the distance that travels from three seconds to four seconds. Another way of thinking about this is that we need the absolute value of s three minus s one, plus the absolute value of s four minus s three, we need these absolute value signs because this difference in position will be negative instead of positive when the particles moving down. Plugging in the t values into our equation, we get negative 27 minus five thirds, plus the absolute value of 32 thirds minus negative 27, which is a total of 199 thirds, or 66.3 repeating millimeters, quite a bit more than the nine millimeter difference in position. This video gave an in depth analysis of a particle moving up and down along a straight and then use the quadratic equation to find the solution. Since this equation doesn't factor easily, this simplifies to four thirds plus or minus the square root of seven over three, which is approximately 0.45, and 2.22. Now I can build a similar sign chart for acceleration, mark the places where acceleration is zero. and plug in values of t, say t equals zero is the equation for acceleration, I get a positive answer here. When I plug in, say t equals one, I get a negative answer here. And when I plug in, say, t equals three, I get another positive answer here. Now, if I put this together with my velocity chart, which changed sign at 01, and three, and went from negative to positive, to negative to positive, I can try to figure out where velocity acceleration both have the same sign. It might be helpful actually to shade in where acceleration is positive. And separately shade in where velocity is positive. And then look for the places where both are shaded. So between zero and 4.5, and greater than three. And then I can also look where both are unshaded that looks like in between one and 2.22. So that's where they're both negative. And then I'll know that V of t and a of t have opposite signs everywhere else. A slightly better answer, we'll use exact values of four thirds plus or minus squared of seven thirds instead of these decimal approximations. So let me write that down. So here is where the particle speeding up. And here, it's where it's slowing down, we can check our work by looking at the graph of position, the particle speeding up with the position graph is getting steeper and steeper, that's the red graph is getting steeper and steeper here, here. And here, just like we found algebraically. As our final example, let's look at net change in position and distance traveled between one and four seconds for the same particle. At time, one second position is five thirds, or about 1.67 millimeters at time for its position is given by 32 thirds, or about 10.67 millimeters, all I'm doing is plugging one and four into this equation. So the net change in position is just the difference of these two numbers. As a four minus as of one, which is nine millimeters. At first glance, it might seem like the total distance traveled between one and four seconds should also be nine millimeters, but actually, it's a little more complicated. Because the particle switches direction during that time period, it doesn't go straight from its position at one second to its position at four seconds. Remember what the graph Position looked like the particle switches direction at one second and at three seconds. So to find the total distance, we need the distance of travels from one second to three seconds, plus the distance that travels from three seconds to four seconds. Another way of thinking about this is that we need the absolute value of s three minus s one, plus the absolute value of s four minus s three, we need these absolute value signs because this difference in position will be negative instead of positive when the particles moving down. Plugging in the t values into our equation, we get negative 27 minus five thirds, plus the absolute value of 32 thirds minus negative 27, which is a total of 199 thirds, or 66.3 repeating millimeters, quite a bit more than the nine millimeter difference in position. This video gave an in depth analysis of a particle moving up and down along a straight line. line. A similar analysis could be done for a particle moving left and right along a straight line, where a positive position means the particles on the right side, and a negative position means the particles on the left side of his Baseline Position. Of course, the same analysis can be done for other objects, not just particles. A typical application is to a ball being thrown straight up and then falling down again. This video will give an economic application of the derivative to a cost function. Suppose that the total cost of producing x tie dyed t shirts is C of x. A similar analysis could be done for a particle moving left and right along a straight line, where a positive position means the particles on the right side, and a negative position means the particles on the left side of his Baseline Position. Of course, the same analysis can be done for other objects, not just particles. A typical application is to a ball being thrown straight up and then falling down again. This video will give an economic application of the derivative to a cost function. Suppose that the total cost of producing x tie dyed t shirts is C of x. I'm going to sketch a few graphs, and you try to decide which graph is the most reasonable representation for C of x. Pause the video for a moment to think about it. All of these candidate graphs that I've drawn have a nonzero y intercept, that's meant to reflect the idea that there's some fixed startup cost and buying equipment before you can even get started. Now, I would like to suggest that C of x should be an increasing function of x, because it's going to cost more money to make more t shirts, you need more supplies and labor. So this function is out. Now it's somewhat reasonable, I think that C of x might be a linear function of x like it is here, if you've got the same cost per t shirt, whether you make 10 t shirts, or 1000 t shirts, the slope in that case would represent the cost per t shirt. And the linear function would mean that cost per t shirt is constant, no matter how many t shirts you're making. But in reality, it's probably going to be cheaper to make 1000 t shirts than it is to make just a few t shirts. And therefore the cost per t shirt, sure slope should be going down as x increases. So this function right here is the one whose slope is going down for larger access. And so I would say that this is the most reasonable representation for C of x as a function of x. In other words, C of x should be an increasing function, but C prime of x should be decreasing. C of 204 minus C of 200 represents the additional cost for making 204 t shirts instead of 200. In formula, you might think of that as the cost of making the last four t shirts. The ratio C of 200 for a minus C of 200 over four is the average rate of change of C of x. The units are units of cost, which is probably dollars per t shirt. And formula you might think of this as the additional cost per t shirt of making the last four t shirts. C prime of 200 is the instantaneous rate of change of C of x. c of x is known as the cost function. And C prime of x is called the marginal cost, which is the rate at which cost is increasing per additional t shirt made. It might seem a little bit weird to take the derivative of C of x since x can really only take on integer values. But we can always approximate C of x with a function whose domain is all real numbers. To make this a little more specific, let's use a cost function of C of x equals 500 plus 300 times the square root of x. In this example, x is supposed to be the number of iPads that are produced, and C of x is the cost of producing them in dollars. Then C of 401 minus C of 400. given by 500 plus 300, times the square root of 401 minus 500 plus 300 times the square root of 400. This simplifies to $7.50, rounded to the nearest cent. This means that it costs an additional $7.50 to go from producing 400 iPads to 401 iPad. In this fictitious example, I'm going to sketch a few graphs, and you try to decide which graph is the most reasonable representation for C of x. Pause the video for a moment to think about it. All of these candidate graphs that I've drawn have a nonzero y intercept, that's meant to reflect the idea that there's some fixed startup cost and buying equipment before you can even get started. Now, I would like to suggest that C of x should be an increasing function of x, because it's going to cost more money to make more t shirts, you need more supplies and labor. So this function is out. Now it's somewhat reasonable, I think that C of x might be a linear function of x like it is here, if you've got the same cost per t shirt, whether you make 10 t shirts, or 1000 t shirts, the slope in that case would represent the cost per t shirt. And the linear function would mean that cost per t shirt is constant, no matter how many t shirts you're making. But in reality, it's probably going to be cheaper to make 1000 t shirts than it is to make just a few t shirts. And therefore the cost per t shirt, sure slope should be going down as x increases. So this function right here is the one whose slope is going down for larger access. And so I would say that this is the most reasonable representation for C of x as a function of x. In other words, C of x should be an increasing function, but C prime of x should be decreasing. C of 204 minus C of 200 represents the additional cost for making 204 t shirts instead of 200. In formula, you might think of that as the cost of making the last four t shirts. The ratio C of 200 for a minus C of 200 over four is the average rate of change of C of x. The units are units of cost, which is probably dollars per t shirt. And formula you might think of this as the additional cost per t shirt of making the last four t shirts. C prime of 200 is the instantaneous rate of change of C of x. c of x is known as the cost function. And C prime of x is called the marginal cost, which is the rate at which cost is increasing per additional t shirt made. It might seem a little bit weird to take the derivative of C of x since x can really only take on integer values. But we can always approximate C of x with a function whose domain is all real numbers. To make this a little more specific, let's use a cost function of C of x equals 500 plus 300 times the square root of x. In this example, x is supposed to be the number of iPads that are produced, and C of x is the cost of producing them in dollars. Then C of 401 minus C of 400. given by 500 plus 300, times the square root of 401 minus 500 plus 300 times the square root of 400. This simplifies to $7.50, rounded to the nearest cent. This means that it costs an additional $7.50 to go from producing 400 iPads to 401 iPad. In this fictitious example, if I want to compute C prime of 400, instead, I can see that C prime of x is equal to 300 times one half x to the minus one half. So C prime of 400 is going to be 300 times one half times 400 to the negative one half, which simplifies to 300 over two times the square root of 400, which is also 7.5, or $7.50. Per iPad. Up to rounding to the nearest cent, these two answers are equal. And it makes sense that C prime of 400 should equal approximately this difference. Since C prime of 400, the derivative is approximately equal to the average rate of change going from 400 to 401, which is just this difference, divided by one. Once again, C prime of 400 is called the marginal cost, and represents the rate at which the cost function is increasing with each additional item. This video gave an example of the cost function, and it's derivative, which is known as marginal cost. This video introduces logarithms. logarithms are a way of writing exponents. The expression log base a of B equals c means that a to the C equals b. In other words, log base a of B is the exponent that you raise a to to get be. The number A is called the base of the logarithm. It's also called the base when we write it in this exponential form. Some students find it helpful to remember this relationship, log base a of B equals c means a to the C equals b, by drawing arrows, if I want to compute C prime of 400, instead, I can see that C prime of x is equal to 300 times one half x to the minus one half. So C prime of 400 is going to be 300 times one half times 400 to the negative one half, which simplifies to 300 over two times the square root of 400, which is also 7.5, or $7.50. Per iPad. Up to rounding to the nearest cent, these two answers are equal. And it makes sense that C prime of 400 should equal approximately this difference. Since C prime of 400, the derivative is approximately equal to the average rate of change going from 400 to 401, which is just this difference, divided by one. Once again, C prime of 400 is called the marginal cost, and represents the rate at which the cost function is increasing with each additional item. This video gave an example of the cost function, and it's derivative, which is known as marginal cost. This video introduces logarithms. logarithms are a way of writing exponents. The expression log base a of B equals c means that a to the C equals b. In other words, log base a of B is the exponent that you raise a to to get be. The number A is called the base of the logarithm. It's also called the base when we write it in this exponential form. Some students find it helpful to remember this relationship, log base a of B equals c means a to the C equals b, by drawing arrows, a to the C equals b. a to the C equals b. Other students like to think of it in terms of asking a question, log base a of fee, asks, What power do you raise a two in order to get b? Let's look at some examples. log base two of eight is three, because two to the three equals eight. In general, log base two of y is asking you the question, What power do you have to raise to two to get y? So for example, log base two of 16 is four, because it's asking you the question to two what power equals 16? And the answer is four. Please pause the video and try some of these other examples. log base two of two is asking, What power do you raise to two to get to? And the answer is one. Two to the one equals two. log base two of one half is asking two to what power gives you one half? Well, to get one half, you need to raise two to a negative power. So that would be two to the negative one. So the answer is negative one. log base two of 1/8 means what power do we raise to two in order to get 1/8. Since one eight is one over two cubed, we have to raise two to the negative three power to get one over two cubed. So our exponent is negative three, and that's our answer to our log expression. Finally, log base two of one is asking to to what power equals one, or anything raised to the zero power gives us one, so this log expression evaluates to zero. Notice that we can get positive negative and zero answers for our logarithm expressions. Please pause the video and figure out what these logs evaluate to to work out log base 10 of another Again, notice that a million is 10 to the sixth power. Now we're asking the question, What power do we raise tend to to get a million? So that is what power do we raise 10? to to get 10 to the six? Well, of course, the answer is going to be six. Similarly, since point O one is 10 to the minus three, this log expressions, the same thing as asking, what's the log base 10 of 10 to the minus three? Well, what power do you have to raise 10? to to get 10 to the minus three? Of course, the answer is negative three. Log base 10 of zero is asking, What power do we raise 10 to to get zero. If you think about it, there's no way to raise 10 to an exponent get zero. Raising 10 to a positive exponent gets us really big positive numbers. Raising 10 to a negative exponent is like one over 10 to a power that's giving us tiny fractions, but they're still positive numbers, we're never going to get zero. Even if we raised 10 to the zero power, we'll just get one. So there's no way to get zero and the log base 10 of zero does not exist. If you try it on your calculator using the log base 10 button, you'll get an error message. Same thing happens when we do log base 10 of negative 100. We're asking 10 to what power equals negative 100. And there's no exponent that will work. And more generally, it's possible to take the log of numbers that are greater than zero, but not for numbers that are less than or equal to zero. In other words, the domain of the function log base a of x, no matter what base you're using, for a, the domain is going to be all positive numbers. A few notes on notation. When you see ln of x, that's called natural log, and it means the log base e of x, where he is that famous number that's about 2.718. When you see log of x with no base at all, by convention, that means log base 10 of x, and it's called the common log. Most scientific calculators have buttons for natural log, and for common log. Let's practice rewriting expressions with logs in them. log base three of one nine is negative two can be rewritten as the expression three to the negative two equals 1/9. Log of 13 is shorthand for log base 10 of 13. So that can be rewritten as 10 to the 1.11394 equals 13. Finally, in this last expression, ln means natural log, or log base e, so I can rewrite this equation as log base e of whenever E equals negative one. Well, that means the same thing as e to the negative one equals one over e, which is true. Now let's go the opposite direction. We'll start with exponential equations and rewrite them as logs. Remember that log base a of B equals c means the same thing Other students like to think of it in terms of asking a question, log base a of fee, asks, What power do you raise a two in order to get b? Let's look at some examples. log base two of eight is three, because two to the three equals eight. In general, log base two of y is asking you the question, What power do you have to raise to two to get y? So for example, log base two of 16 is four, because it's asking you the question to two what power equals 16? And the answer is four. Please pause the video and try some of these other examples. log base two of two is asking, What power do you raise to two to get to? And the answer is one. Two to the one equals two. log base two of one half is asking two to what power gives you one half? Well, to get one half, you need to raise two to a negative power. So that would be two to the negative one. So the answer is negative one. log base two of 1/8 means what power do we raise to two in order to get 1/8. Since one eight is one over two cubed, we have to raise two to the negative three power to get one over two cubed. So our exponent is negative three, and that's our answer to our log expression. Finally, log base two of one is asking to to what power equals one, or anything raised to the zero power gives us one, so this log expression evaluates to zero. Notice that we can get positive negative and zero answers for our logarithm expressions. Please pause the video and figure out what these logs evaluate to to work out log base 10 of another Again, notice that a million is 10 to the sixth power. Now we're asking the question, What power do we raise tend to to get a million? So that is what power do we raise 10? to to get 10 to the six? Well, of course, the answer is going to be six. Similarly, since point O one is 10 to the minus three, this log expressions, the same thing as asking, what's the log base 10 of 10 to the minus three? Well, what power do you have to raise 10? to to get 10 to the minus three? Of course, the answer is negative three. Log base 10 of zero is asking, What power do we raise 10 to to get zero. If you think about it, there's no way to raise 10 to an exponent get zero. Raising 10 to a positive exponent gets us really big positive numbers. Raising 10 to a negative exponent is like one over 10 to a power that's giving us tiny fractions, but they're still positive numbers, we're never going to get zero. Even if we raised 10 to the zero power, we'll just get one. So there's no way to get zero and the log base 10 of zero does not exist. If you try it on your calculator using the log base 10 button, you'll get an error message. Same thing happens when we do log base 10 of negative 100. We're asking 10 to what power equals negative 100. And there's no exponent that will work. And more generally, it's possible to take the log of numbers that are greater than zero, but not for numbers that are less than or equal to zero. In other words, the domain of the function log base a of x, no matter what base you're using, for a, the domain is going to be all positive numbers. A few notes on notation. When you see ln of x, that's called natural log, and it means the log base e of x, where he is that famous number that's about 2.718. When you see log of x with no base at all, by convention, that means log base 10 of x, and it's called the common log. Most scientific calculators have buttons for natural log, and for common log. Let's practice rewriting expressions with logs in them. log base three of one nine is negative two can be rewritten as the expression three to the negative two equals 1/9. Log of 13 is shorthand for log base 10 of 13. So that can be rewritten as 10 to the 1.11394 equals 13. Finally, in this last expression, ln means natural log, or log base e, so I can rewrite this equation as log base e of whenever E equals negative one. Well, that means the same thing as e to the negative one equals one over e, which is true. Now let's go the opposite direction. We'll start with exponential equations and rewrite them as logs. Remember that log base a of B equals c means the same thing as a to the C equals b, as a to the C equals b, the base stays the same in both expressions. So for this example, the base of three in the exponential equation, that's going to be the same as the base in our log. Now I just have to figure out what's in the argument of the log. And what goes on the other side of the equal sign. Remember that the answer to a log is an exponent. So the thing that goes in this box should be my exponent for my exponential equation. In other words, you and I'll put the 9.78 as the argument of my log. This works because log base three of 9.78 equals u means the same thing as three to the U equals 9.78, which is just what we started with. In the second example, the base of my exponential equation is E. So the base of my log is going to be the answer to my log is an exponent. In this case, the exponent 3x plus seven. And the other expression, the four minus y becomes my argument of my log. Let me check, log base e of four minus y equals 3x plus seven means e to 3x plus seven equals four minus Y, which is just what I started with. I can also rewrite log base e as natural log. This video introduced the idea of logs. And the fact that log base a of B equal c means the same thing as a to the C equals b. So log base a of B is asking you the question, What power exponent Do you raise a to in order to get b. In this video, we'll work out the graph, so some log functions and also talk about their domains. For this first example, let's graph a log function by hand by plotting some points. The function we're working with is y equals log base two of x, I'll make a chart of x and y values. Since we're working this out by hand, I want to pick x values for which it's easy to compute log base two of x. So I'll start out with the x value of one. Because log base two of one is zero, log base anything of one is 02 is another x value that's easy to compute log base two of two, that's asking, What power do I raise to two to get to one? And the answer is one. Power other powers of two are easy to work with. So for example, log base two of four that saying what power do I raise to to to get four, so the answer is two. Similarly, log base two of eight is three, and log base two of 16 is four. Let me also work with some fractional values for X. If x is one half, then log base two of one half that saying what power do I raise to two to get one half? Well, that needs a power of negative one. It's also easy to compute by hand, the log base two of 1/4 and 1/8. log base two of 1/4 is negative two, since two to the negative two is 1/4. And similarly, log base two of 1/8 is negative three. I'll put some tick marks on my x and y axes. Please pause the video and take a moment to plot these points. Let's see I have the point, one, zero, that's here to one that's here, for two, that is here. And then eight, three, which is the base stays the same in both expressions. So for this example, the base of three in the exponential equation, that's going to be the same as the base in our log. Now I just have to figure out what's in the argument of the log. And what goes on the other side of the equal sign. Remember that the answer to a log is an exponent. So the thing that goes in this box should be my exponent for my exponential equation. In other words, you and I'll put the 9.78 as the argument of my log. This works because log base three of 9.78 equals u means the same thing as three to the U equals 9.78, which is just what we started with. In the second example, the base of my exponential equation is E. So the base of my log is going to be the answer to my log is an exponent. In this case, the exponent 3x plus seven. And the other expression, the four minus y becomes my argument of my log. Let me check, log base e of four minus y equals 3x plus seven means e to 3x plus seven equals four minus Y, which is just what I started with. I can also rewrite log base e as natural log. This video introduced the idea of logs. And the fact that log base a of B equal c means the same thing as a to the C equals b. So log base a of B is asking you the question, What power exponent Do you raise a to in order to get b. In this video, we'll work out the graph, so some log functions and also talk about their domains. For this first example, let's graph a log function by hand by plotting some points. The function we're working with is y equals log base two of x, I'll make a chart of x and y values. Since we're working this out by hand, I want to pick x values for which it's easy to compute log base two of x. So I'll start out with the x value of one. Because log base two of one is zero, log base anything of one is 02 is another x value that's easy to compute log base two of two, that's asking, What power do I raise to two to get to one? And the answer is one. Power other powers of two are easy to work with. So for example, log base two of four that saying what power do I raise to to to get four, so the answer is two. Similarly, log base two of eight is three, and log base two of 16 is four. Let me also work with some fractional values for X. If x is one half, then log base two of one half that saying what power do I raise to two to get one half? Well, that needs a power of negative one. It's also easy to compute by hand, the log base two of 1/4 and 1/8. log base two of 1/4 is negative two, since two to the negative two is 1/4. And similarly, log base two of 1/8 is negative three. I'll put some tick marks on my x and y axes. Please pause the video and take a moment to plot these points. Let's see I have the point, one, zero, that's here to one that's here, for two, that is here. And then eight, three, which is here. here. And the fractional x values, one half goes with negative one, and 1/4 with negative two 1/8 with negative three. And the fractional x values, one half goes with negative one, and 1/4 with negative two 1/8 with negative three. And if I connect the dots, I get a graph that looks something like this. If I had smaller and smaller fractions, I would keep getting more and more negative answers when I took log base two of them, so my graph is getting more and more negative, my y values are getting more and more negative as x is getting close to zero. Now I didn't draw any parts of the graph over here with negative X values, I didn't put any negative X values on my chart. That omission is no accident. Because if you try to take the log base two or base anything of a negative number, like say negative four or something, there's no answer. This doesn't exist because there's no power that you can raise to two to get a negative number. So there are no points on the graph for negative X values. And similarly, there are no points on the graph where x is zero, because you can't take log base two of zero, there's no power you can raise to to to get zero. I want to observe some key features of this graph. First of all, the domain is x values greater than zero. In interval notation, I can write that as a round bracket because I don't want to include zero to infinity, the range is going to be the y values, while they go all the way down into the far reaches of the negative numbers. And the graph gradually increases y value is getting bigger and bigger. So the range is actually all real numbers are an interval notation negative infinity to infinity. Finally, I want to point out that this graph has a vertical asymptote at the y axis, that is at the line x equals zero. I'll draw that on my graph with a dotted line. A vertical asymptote is a line that our functions graph gets closer and closer to so this is The graph of y equals log base two of x. But if I wanted to graph say, y equals log base 10 of x, it would look very similar, it would still have a domain of X values greater than zero, a range of all real numbers and a vertical asymptote at the y axis, it would still go through the point one zero, but it would go through the point 10. One instead, because log base 10 of 10 is one, it would look pretty much the same, just a lot flatter over here. But even though it doesn't look like it with the way I've drawn it, it still gradually goes up to n towards infinity. In fact, the graph of y equals log base neaa of X for a bigger than one looks pretty much the same, and has the same three properties. Now that we know what the basic log graph looks like, we can plot at least rough graphs of other log functions without plotting points. Here we have the graph of natural log of X plus five. And again, I'm just going to draw a rough graph. If I did want to do a more accurate graph, I probably would want to plot some points. But I know that roughly a log graph, if it was just like y equals ln of x, that would look something like this, and it would go through the point one zero, And if I connect the dots, I get a graph that looks something like this. If I had smaller and smaller fractions, I would keep getting more and more negative answers when I took log base two of them, so my graph is getting more and more negative, my y values are getting more and more negative as x is getting close to zero. Now I didn't draw any parts of the graph over here with negative X values, I didn't put any negative X values on my chart. That omission is no accident. Because if you try to take the log base two or base anything of a negative number, like say negative four or something, there's no answer. This doesn't exist because there's no power that you can raise to two to get a negative number. So there are no points on the graph for negative X values. And similarly, there are no points on the graph where x is zero, because you can't take log base two of zero, there's no power you can raise to to to get zero. I want to observe some key features of this graph. First of all, the domain is x values greater than zero. In interval notation, I can write that as a round bracket because I don't want to include zero to infinity, the range is going to be the y values, while they go all the way down into the far reaches of the negative numbers. And the graph gradually increases y value is getting bigger and bigger. So the range is actually all real numbers are an interval notation negative infinity to infinity. Finally, I want to point out that this graph has a vertical asymptote at the y axis, that is at the line x equals zero. I'll draw that on my graph with a dotted line. A vertical asymptote is a line that our functions graph gets closer and closer to so this is The graph of y equals log base two of x. But if I wanted to graph say, y equals log base 10 of x, it would look very similar, it would still have a domain of X values greater than zero, a range of all real numbers and a vertical asymptote at the y axis, it would still go through the point one zero, but it would go through the point 10. One instead, because log base 10 of 10 is one, it would look pretty much the same, just a lot flatter over here. But even though it doesn't look like it with the way I've drawn it, it still gradually goes up to n towards infinity. In fact, the graph of y equals log base neaa of X for a bigger than one looks pretty much the same, and has the same three properties. Now that we know what the basic log graph looks like, we can plot at least rough graphs of other log functions without plotting points. Here we have the graph of natural log of X plus five. And again, I'm just going to draw a rough graph. If I did want to do a more accurate graph, I probably would want to plot some points. But I know that roughly a log graph, if it was just like y equals ln of x, that would look something like this, and it would go through the point one zero, with a vertical asymptote along the y axis. Now if I want to graph ln of x plus five, that just shifts our graph by five units, it'll still have the same vertical asymptote, since the vertical line shifted up by five units is still a vertical line. But instead of going through one zero, it'll go through the point, one, five. So I'll draw a rough sketch here. Let's compare our starting function y equals ln x, and the transformed version y equals ln x plus five in terms of the domain, the range and the vertical asymptote. Our original function y equals ln x had a domain of zero to infinity. Since adding five on the outside affects the y values, and the domain is the x values, this transformation doesn't change the domain. So the domain is still from zero to infinity. Now the range of our original y equals ln x was from negative infinity to infinity. Shifting up by five does affect the y values, and the range is talking about the y values. But since the original range was all real numbers, if you add five to all set of all real numbers, you still get the set of all real numbers. So in this case, the range doesn't change either. And finally, we already saw that the original vertical asymptote of the y axis x equals zero, when we shift that up by five units, it's still the vertical line x equals zero. In this next example, we're starting with a log base 10 function. And since the plus two is on the inside, that means we shift that graph left by two. So I'll draw our basic log function. Here's our basic log function. So I'll think of that as y equals log of x going through the point one, zero, here's its vertical asymptote. Now I need to shift everything left by two. So my vertical asymptote shifts left, and now it's at the line x equals negative two, instead of at x equals zero, and my graph, let's see my point, one zero gets shifted to, let's see negative one zero, since I'm subtracting two from the axis, and here's a rough sketch of the resulting graph. Let's compare the features of the two graphs drawn here. We're talking about domains, the original kind of domain of from zero to infinity. But now I've shifted that left. So I subtracted two from all my exercises. And here's my new domain, which I can also verify just by looking at the picture. My range was originally from negative infinity to infinity. Well, shifting left only affects the x value, so it doesn't even affect the range. So my range is still negative infinity to infinity. My vertical asymptote was originally at x equals zero. And since I subtract two from all my x values, that shifts that to x equals negative two. In this last problem, I'm not going to worry about drawing this graph. I'll just use algebra to compute its domain. So let's think about What's the issue, when you're taking the logs of things? Well, you can't take the log of a negative number or zero. So whatever is inside the argument of the log function, whatever is being fed into log had better be greater than zero. So I'll write that down, we need to minus 3x, to be greater than zero. Now it's a matter of solving an inequality. Two has got to be greater than 3x. So two thirds is greater than x. In other words, x has to be less than two thirds. So our domain is all the x values from negative infinity to two thirds, not including two thirds, it's a good idea to memorize the basic shape of the graph of a log function. It looks something like this, go through the point one zero, and has a vertical asymptote on the y axis. Also, if you remember that you can't take the log of a negative number, or zero, then that helps you quickly compute domains for log functions. Whatever's inside the log function, you set that greater than zero, and solve. This video is about combining logs and exponents. Please pause the video and take a moment to use your calculator to evaluate the following four expressions. with a vertical asymptote along the y axis. Now if I want to graph ln of x plus five, that just shifts our graph by five units, it'll still have the same vertical asymptote, since the vertical line shifted up by five units is still a vertical line. But instead of going through one zero, it'll go through the point, one, five. So I'll draw a rough sketch here. Let's compare our starting function y equals ln x, and the transformed version y equals ln x plus five in terms of the domain, the range and the vertical asymptote. Our original function y equals ln x had a domain of zero to infinity. Since adding five on the outside affects the y values, and the domain is the x values, this transformation doesn't change the domain. So the domain is still from zero to infinity. Now the range of our original y equals ln x was from negative infinity to infinity. Shifting up by five does affect the y values, and the range is talking about the y values. But since the original range was all real numbers, if you add five to all set of all real numbers, you still get the set of all real numbers. So in this case, the range doesn't change either. And finally, we already saw that the original vertical asymptote of the y axis x equals zero, when we shift that up by five units, it's still the vertical line x equals zero. In this next example, we're starting with a log base 10 function. And since the plus two is on the inside, that means we shift that graph left by two. So I'll draw our basic log function. Here's our basic log function. So I'll think of that as y equals log of x going through the point one, zero, here's its vertical asymptote. Now I need to shift everything left by two. So my vertical asymptote shifts left, and now it's at the line x equals negative two, instead of at x equals zero, and my graph, let's see my point, one zero gets shifted to, let's see negative one zero, since I'm subtracting two from the axis, and here's a rough sketch of the resulting graph.

Whatever's inside the log function, you set that greater than zero, and solve. This video is about combining logs and exponents. Please pause the video and take a moment to use your calculator to evaluate the following four expressions. Remember, that log base 10 on your calculator is the log button. While log base e on your calculator is the natural log button, you should find that the log base 10 of 10 cubed is three, the log base e of e to the 4.2 is 4.2 10 to the log base 10 of 1000 is 1000. And eat the log base e of 9.6 is 9.6. In each case, the log and the exponential function with the same base undo each other, and we're left with the exponent. In fact, it's true that for any base a the log base a of a to the x is equal to x. The same sort of cancellation happens if we do the exponential function in the log function with the same base in the opposite order. For example, we take 10 to the power of log base 10 of 1000, the 10 to the power and the log base 10 undo each other, and we're left with the 1000s. This happens for any base a a to the log base a of x is equal to x. We can describe this by saying that an exponential function and a log function with the same base undo each other. If you're familiar with the language of inverse functions, the exponential function and log function are inverses. Let's see why these roles hold for the first log role. log base a of a dx is asking the question, What power do we raise a two in order to get a to the x? In other words, a to what power is a to the x? Well, the answer is clearly x. And that's why log base a of a to the x equals x. For the second log rule, notice that the log base a of x means the power we raise a two to get x. But this expression is saying that we're supposed to raise a to that power. If we raise a to the power, we need to raise a two to get x, then we'll certainly get x. Now let's use these two roles. In some examples. If we want to find three to the log base three of 1.43 to the power and log base three undo each other, so we're left with 1.4. Remember, that log base 10 on your calculator is the log button. While log base e on your calculator is the natural log button, you should find that the log base 10 of 10 cubed is three, the log base e of e to the 4.2 is 4.2 10 to the log base 10 of 1000 is 1000. And eat the log base e of 9.6 is 9.6. In each case, the log and the exponential function with the same base undo each other, and we're left with the exponent. In fact, it's true that for any base a the log base a of a to the x is equal to x. The same sort of cancellation happens if we do the exponential function in the log function with the same base in the opposite order. For example, we take 10 to the power of log base 10 of 1000, the 10 to the power and the log base 10 undo each other, and we're left with the 1000s. This happens for any base a a to the log base a of x is equal to x. We can describe this by saying that an exponential function and a log function with the same base undo each other. If you're familiar with the language of inverse functions, the exponential function and log function are inverses. Let's see why these roles hold for the first log role. log base a of a dx is asking the question, What power do we raise a two in order to get a to the x? In other words, a to what power is a to the x? Well, the answer is clearly x. And that's why log base a of a to the x equals x. For the second log rule, notice that the log base a of x means the power we raise a two to get x. But this expression is saying that we're supposed to raise a to that power. If we raise a to the power, we need to raise a two to get x, then we'll certainly get x. Now let's use these two roles. In some examples. If we want to find three to the log base three of 1.43 to the power and log base three undo each other, so we're left with 1.4. If we want to find ln of e to the x, remember that ln means log base e, so we're taking log base e of e to the x. If we want to find ln of e to the x, remember that ln means log base e, so we're taking log base e of e to the x. Well, those functions undo each other and we're left with x. If we want to take 10 to the log of three z, remember that log without a base written implies that the base is 10. So really, we want to take 10 to the log base 10 of three z will tend to a power and log base 10 undo each other. So we're left with a three z. Finally, does this last statement hold is ln of 10 to the x equal to x? Well, ln means log base e. So we're taking log base e of 10 to the x, notice that the base of the log and the base of the exponential function are not the same thing. So they don't undo each other. And in fact, log base e of 10 to the x is not usually equal to x, we can check with one example, say if x equals one, then log base e of 10 to the one, that's log base e of 10. And we can check on the calculator that's equal to 2.3. In some more decimals, which is not the same thing as one. So this statement is false, it does not hold. We need the basis to be the same for logs and exponent to undo each other. In this video, we saw that logs and exponents with the same base undo each other. Specifically, log base a of a to the x is equal to x and a to the log base a of x is also equal to x Well, those functions undo each other and we're left with x. If we want to take 10 to the log of three z, remember that log without a base written implies that the base is 10. So really, we want to take 10 to the log base 10 of three z will tend to a power and log base 10 undo each other. So we're left with a three z. Finally, does this last statement hold is ln of 10 to the x equal to x? Well, ln means log base e. So we're taking log base e of 10 to the x, notice that the base of the log and the base of the exponential function are not the same thing. So they don't undo each other. And in fact, log base e of 10 to the x is not usually equal to x, we can check with one example, say if x equals one, then log base e of 10 to the one, that's log base e of 10. And we can check on the calculator that's equal to 2.3. In some more decimals, which is not the same thing as one. So this statement is false, it does not hold. We need the basis to be the same for logs and exponent to undo each other. In this video, we saw that logs and exponents with the same base undo each other. Specifically, log base a of a to the x is equal to x and a to the log base a of x is also equal to x for any values of x and any base a. This video is about rules or properties of logs. The log rules are closely related to the exponent rules. So let's start by reviewing some of the exponent rules. for any values of x and any base a. This video is about rules or properties of logs. The log rules are closely related to the exponent rules. So let's start by reviewing some of the exponent rules. To keep things simple, we'll write everything down with a base of two. Even though the exponent rules hold for any base, we know that if we raise two to the zero power, we get one, we have a product rule for exponents, which says that two to the M times two to the n is equal to two to the m plus n. In other words, if we multiply two numbers, then we add the exponents. We also have a quotient rule that says that two to the M divided by n to the n is equal to two to the m minus n. In words, that says that if we divide two numbers, then we subtract the exponents. Finally, we have a power rule that says if we take a power to a power, then we multiply the exponents. Each of these exponent rules can be rewritten as a log rule. The first rule, two to the zero equals one can be rewritten in terms of logs as log base two of one equals zero. That's because log base two of one equals zero means two to the zero equals one. The second rule, the product rule, can be rewritten in terms of logs by saying log of x times y equals log of x plus log of y. I'll make these base two to agree with my base that I'm using for my exponent rules. In words, that says the log of the product is the sum of the logs. Since logs really represent exponents. This is saying that when you multiply two numbers together, you add their exponents, which is just what we said for the exponent version. The quotient rule for exponents can be rewritten in terms of logs by saying the log of x divided by y is equal to the log of x minus the log of y. In words, we can say that the log of the quotient is equal to the difference of the logs. Since logs are really exponents, another way of saying the same thing is that when you divide two numbers, you subtract their exponents. That's how we described the exponent rule above. Finally, the power rule for exponents can be rewritten in terms of logs by saying the log of x to the n is equal to n times log of x. Sometimes people describe this rule by saying when you take the log of an expression with an exponent, you can bring down the exponent and multiply. If we think of x as being some power of two, this is really saying when we take a power to a power, we multiply their exponents. That's exactly how we described the power rule above. It doesn't really matter if you multiply this exponent on the left side, or on the right side, but it's more traditional to multiply it on the left side. I've given these rules with the base of two, but they actually work for any base. To help you remember them, please take a moment to write out the log rules using a base of a you should get the following chart. Let's use the log rules to rewrite the following expressions as a sum or difference of logs. In the first expression, we have a log base 10 of a quotient. So we can rewrite the log of the quotient To keep things simple, we'll write everything down with a base of two. Even though the exponent rules hold for any base, we know that if we raise two to the zero power, we get one, we have a product rule for exponents, which says that two to the M times two to the n is equal to two to the m plus n. In other words, if we multiply two numbers, then we add the exponents. We also have a quotient rule that says that two to the M divided by n to the n is equal to two to the m minus n. In words, that says that if we divide two numbers, then we subtract the exponents. Finally, we have a power rule that says if we take a power to a power, then we multiply the exponents. Each of these exponent rules can be rewritten as a log rule. The first rule, two to the zero equals one can be rewritten in terms of logs as log base two of one equals zero. That's because log base two of one equals zero means two to the zero equals one. The second rule, the product rule, can be rewritten in terms of logs by saying log of x times y equals log of x plus log of y. I'll make these base two to agree with my base that I'm using for my exponent rules. In words, that says the log of the product is the sum of the logs. Since logs really represent exponents. This is saying that when you multiply two numbers together, you add their exponents, which is just what we said for the exponent version. The quotient rule for exponents can be rewritten in terms of logs by saying the log of x divided by y is equal to the log of x minus the log of y. In words, we can say that the log of the quotient is equal to the difference of the logs. Since logs are really exponents, another way of saying the same thing is that when you divide two numbers, you subtract their exponents. That's how we described the exponent rule above. Finally, the power rule for exponents can be rewritten in terms of logs by saying the log of x to the n is equal to n times log of x. Sometimes people describe this rule by saying when you take the log of an expression with an exponent, you can bring down the exponent and multiply. If we think of x as being some power of two, this is really saying when we take a power to a power, we multiply their exponents. That's exactly how we described the power rule above.

I've given these rules with the base of two, but they actually work for any base. To help you remember them, please take a moment to write out the log rules using a base of a you should get the following chart. Let's use the log rules to rewrite the following expressions as a sum or difference of logs. In the first expression, we have a log base 10 of a quotient. So we can rewrite the log of the quotient as the difference of the logs. Now we still have the log of a product, I can rewrite the log of a product as the sum of the logs as the difference of the logs. Now we still have the log of a product, I can rewrite the log of a product as the sum of the logs So that is log of y plus log of z. When I put things together, I have to be careful, because here I'm subtracting the entire log expression. So I need to subtract both terms of this son. So that is log of y plus log of z. When I put things together, I have to be careful, because here I'm subtracting the entire log expression. So I need to subtract both terms of this son. I'll make sure I do that by putting them in parentheses. Now I can simplify a little bit by distributing the negative sign. And here's my final answer. In my next expression, I have the log of a product. So I can rewrite that as the sum of two logs. I can also use my power rule to bring down the exponent T, and multiply it in the front. That gives me the final expression log of five plus I'll make sure I do that by putting them in parentheses. Now I can simplify a little bit by distributing the negative sign. And here's my final answer. In my next expression, I have the log of a product. So I can rewrite that as the sum of two logs. I can also use my power rule to bring down the exponent T, and multiply it in the front. That gives me the final expression log of five plus t times log of two. One common mistake on this problem is to rewrite this expression as t times log of five times two. In fact, those two expressions are not equal. Because the T only applies to the two, not to the whole five times two, we can't just bring it down in front using the power rule. After all, the power rule only applies to a single expression raised to an exponent, and not to a product like this. And these next examples, we're going to go the other direction. Here, we're given sums and differences of logs. And we want to wrap them up into a single log expression. By look at the first two pieces, that's a difference of logs. So I know I can rewrite it as the log of a quotient. Now I have the sum of two logs. So I can rewrite that as the log of a product. I'll clean that up a little bit and rewrite it as log base five of a times c over B. In my second example, I can rewrite the sum of my logs as the log of a product. Now, I would like to rewrite this difference of logs as the log of a quotient, but I can't do it yet, because of that factor of two multiplied in front. But I can use the power rule backwards to put that two back up in the exponent. So I'll do that first. So I will copy down the ln of x plus one times x minus one, and rewrite this second term as ln of x squared minus one squared. Now I have a straightforward difference of two logs, which I can rewrite as the log of a quotient. I can actually simplify this some more. Since x plus one times x minus one is the same thing as x squared minus one. I can cancel factors to get ln of one over x squared minus one. In this video, we solve for rules for logs that are related to exponent rules. First, we saw that the log with any base of one is equal to zero. Second, we saw the product rule, the log of a product is equal to the sum of the logs. We saw the quotient rule, the log of a quotient is the difference of the logs. And we saw the power rule. When you take a log of an expression with an exponent in it, you can bring down the exponent and multiply it. It's worth noticing that there's no log rule that helps you split up the log of a song. In particular, the log of a psalm is not equal to the sum of the logs. If you think about logs and exponent rules going together, this kind of makes sense, because there's also no rule for rewriting the sum of two exponential expressions. Log roles will be super handy. As we start to solve equations using locks. The chain rule is a really useful method for finding the derivative of the composition of two functions. Let's start with a brief review of composition. f composed with g means that we apply f to the output of G as a diagram, this means we start with x and apply g first. t times log of two. One common mistake on this problem is to rewrite this expression as t times log of five times two. In fact, those two expressions are not equal. Because the T only applies to the two, not to the whole five times two, we can't just bring it down in front using the power rule. After all, the power rule only applies to a single expression raised to an exponent, and not to a product like this. And these next examples, we're going to go the other direction.

But I can use the power rule backwards to put that two back up in the exponent. So I'll do that first. So I will copy down the ln of x plus one times x minus one, and rewrite this second term as ln of x squared minus one squared. Now I have a straightforward difference of two logs, which I can rewrite as the log of a quotient. I can actually simplify this some more. Since x plus one times x minus one is the same thing as x squared minus one. I can cancel factors to get ln of one over x squared minus one. In this video, we solve for rules for logs that are related to exponent rules. First, we saw that the log with any base of one is equal to zero.

As we start to solve equations using locks. The chain rule is a really useful method for finding the derivative of the composition of two functions. Let's start with a brief review of composition. f composed with g means that we apply f to the output of G as a diagram, this means we start with x and apply g first. Then we apply f to the output to get our final results I'm going to call G, the inner function, and F the outer function. Because g looks like it's on the inside of f, Then we apply f to the output to get our final results I'm going to call G, the inner function, and F the outer function. Because g looks like it's on the inside of f, in this standard notation, we can write h of x, which is the square root of sine of x as the composition of two functions, by letting sine of x be the inner function, and the square root function be the outer function, which I write as f of u equals the square root of u. I like to do this sort of dissection of functions, by drawing a box around part of the function, whatever is inside the box becomes my inner function, whatever we do to the box becomes our outer function, in this case, taking the square root. This allows us to write h of x as the composition, f of g of x, where f and g are the outer and inner functions defined here. Please take a moment to write the next two functions as compositions of functions, before you go on. A natural way to write k of x as a composition is to let our inner function be tan of x plus seacon of x. The outer function describes what happens to that box the inner function, it gets cubed and multiplied by five. There's several ways to write the next example as a composition of functions. For example, we could take x squared as our inner function, and then our outer function takes a to the sign of that inner function. Alternatively, we could take the inner function to be sine of x squared. And then the outer function in this standard notation, we can write h of x, which is the square root of sine of x as the composition of two functions, by letting sine of x be the inner function, and the square root function be the outer function, which I write as f of u equals the square root of u. I like to do this sort of dissection of functions, by drawing a box around part of the function, whatever is inside the box becomes my inner function, whatever we do to the box becomes our outer function, in this case, taking the square root. This allows us to write h of x as the composition, f of g of x, where f and g are the outer and inner functions defined here. Please take a moment to write the next two functions as compositions of functions, before you go on. A natural way to write k of x as a composition is to let our inner function be tan of x plus seacon of x. The outer function describes what happens to that box the inner function, it gets cubed and multiplied by five. There's several ways to write the next example as a composition of functions. For example, we could take x squared as our inner function, and then our outer function takes a to the sign of that inner function. Alternatively, we could take the inner function to be sine of x squared. And then the outer function has to be e to the power. It's also possible to write our function r of x as a composition of three functions. An inner function of x squared, a middle function of sine and an outermost function of e to the power, which are right as h of V equals e to the V. has to be e to the power. It's also possible to write our function r of x as a composition of three functions. An inner function of x squared, a middle function of sine and an outermost function of e to the power, which are right as h of V equals e to the V. When calculating the derivatives of complicated functions, it's really important to recognize them as compositions of simpler functions. That way, we can build up the derivative in terms of the simpler derivatives. And that's the idea behind the chain rule. The chain rule tells us if we have two differentiable functions, then the derivative of the composition f composed with g of x is equal to the derivative of the outer function evaluated on the inner function times the derivative of the inner function. Sometimes the chain rule is written instead, in lightness notation, that is the dydx notation. To see how this works, let's let u equal g of x. And let's let y equal f of u. In other words, y is f of When calculating the derivatives of complicated functions, it's really important to recognize them as compositions of simpler functions. That way, we can build up the derivative in terms of the simpler derivatives. And that's the idea behind the chain rule. The chain rule tells us if we have two differentiable functions, then the derivative of the composition f composed with g of x is equal to the derivative of the outer function evaluated on the inner function times the derivative of the inner function. Sometimes the chain rule is written instead, in lightness notation, that is the dydx notation. To see how this works, let's let u equal g of x. And let's let y equal f of u. In other words, y is f of g of x. g of x. Now do u dx is just another way of writing g prime of x, and d y d u is another way of writing f prime of U. or in other words, f prime of g of x. Finally, if we write D y dX, that means we're taking the derivative of f composed with g. So that's f composed with g prime of x. Using this key, I can rewrite the expression above as the y dx equals d y d u Now do u dx is just another way of writing g prime of x, and d y d u is another way of writing f prime of U. or in other words, f prime of g of x. Finally, if we write D y dX, that means we're taking the derivative of f composed with g. So that's f composed with g prime of x. Using this key, I can rewrite the expression above as the y dx equals d y d u times d u dx. These are the two alternative ways of writing the chain rule. Let's use the chain rule to take the derivative of the square root of sine x. times d u dx. These are the two alternative ways of writing the chain rule. Let's use the chain rule to take the derivative of the square root of sine x. Actually, I'm going to rewrite this as h of x equals sine x to the one half power to make it easier to take derivatives. As a composition, we're thinking of the inner function as sine x and the outer function as the one half power. So the chain rule tells us that to take h prime Actually, I'm going to rewrite this as h of x equals sine x to the one half power to make it easier to take derivatives. As a composition, we're thinking of the inner function as sine x and the outer function as the one half power. So the chain rule tells us that to take h prime of x we need to take the derivative of the outer function evaluated on the inner function and then multiply that by the derivative of the inner function, we know that the derivative of the inner function, sine x is just cosine x. And the derivative of the outer function is one half times u to the negative one half. So h prime of x is then one half times u to the negative one half. But that's evaluated on the inner function, sine of of x we need to take the derivative of the outer function evaluated on the inner function and then multiply that by the derivative of the inner function, we know that the derivative of the inner function, sine x is just cosine x. And the derivative of the outer function is one half times u to the negative one half. So h prime of x is then one half times u to the negative one half. But that's evaluated on the inner function, sine of x. x. And then we multiply that by cosine of x. Again, that's the derivative of the outer function evaluated on the inner function times the derivative of the inner function. And we found the derivative using the chain rule. For the next example, our inner function was tan x plus seacon X and our outer function, f of u was five u cubed. So k prime of x is 15 times u squared. But that's the evaluated on the inner function 10x plus seacon x, then we still need to multiply that by the derivative of the inner function 10x plus seacon x. So we get the 15 tan x plus secant x squared times the derivative of tan x, which is secant squared x, plus the derivative of secant x, which is secant x, tan x. And that's our chain rule derivative. In this last example, we're thinking of the outermost function as being e to the power and its inner function is sine of x squared. But sine of x squared itself has an outer function of sine and an inner function of x squared. So to find r prime of x, we first have to take the derivative of the outermost function, well, the derivative of e to the power is just e to the power. And then we multiply that by cosine of x. Again, that's the derivative of the outer function evaluated on the inner function times the derivative of the inner function. And we found the derivative using the chain rule. For the next example, our inner function was tan x plus seacon X and our outer function, f of u was five u cubed. So k prime of x is 15 times u squared. But that's the evaluated on the inner function 10x plus seacon x, then we still need to multiply that by the derivative of the inner function 10x plus seacon x. So we get the 15 tan x plus secant x squared times the derivative of tan x, which is secant squared x, plus the derivative of secant x, which is secant x, tan x. And that's our chain rule derivative. In this last example, we're thinking of the outermost function as being e to the power and its inner function is sine of x squared. But sine of x squared itself has an outer function of sine and an inner function of x squared. So to find r prime of x, we first have to take the derivative of the outermost function, well, the derivative of e to the power is just e to the power. And now we evaluate that on its inner function, sine of x squared. But now by the chain rule, we have to multiply that by the derivative of the inner function, sine of x squared. I'll copy down the E to the sine x squared. And I'll use the chain rule a second time to find the derivative of sine x squared. Now the outer function is sine, and the derivative of sine is cosine. I need to evaluate it on its inner function of x squared, and then multiply that by the derivative of the inner function. After copying things down, I just have to take the derivative of x squared, which is 2x And now we evaluate that on its inner function, sine of x squared. But now by the chain rule, we have to multiply that by the derivative of the inner function, sine of x squared. I'll copy down the E to the sine x squared. And I'll use the chain rule a second time to find the derivative of sine x squared. Now the outer function is sine, and the derivative of sine is cosine. I need to evaluate it on its inner function of x squared, and then multiply that by the derivative of the inner function. After copying things down, I just have to take the derivative of x squared, which is 2x by the power. by the power. This video introduced the chain rule, which says that the derivative of f composed with g at x is equal to f prime at g of x times g prime at x, or equivalently, d y dx is equal to d y d u times d u dx. This video gives some more examples and a justification of the chain rule, and also includes a handy formula for the derivative of a to the x with respect to x, where A is any positive number. In the next example, I want to show using the chain rule that the derivative of five to the x is equal to ln five times five to the x. First, I want to rewrite five to the x as easily ln five times x. And I can do that because e to the ln five is equal to five. So e to the ln five to the x power is equal to five to the x. But e to the ln five to the x power using exponent rules is just e to the ln five times x. So if I want to take the derivative of five to the x, after rewriting it as e to the ln five times x, let me think of the inner function as being ln five times x. And I'm going to think of the outer function as being E to that power. That's what I wanted to Make the derivative of. So by the chain rule, I can first take the derivative of the outer function, derivative of e to the power is just e to the power, and I evaluate it at its inner function. But then by the chain rule, I need to take the derivative of the inner function, well, the derivative of ln five times x is just the constant coefficient ln five. And that's my derivative. Now, I know that e to the ln five times x is just five to the x. That's what we talked about before. So my final answer is five to the x times ln five, or I guess I can rewrite that in the other order. That is that there's nothing special about five in this example, I could have done this same process with any a base positive base a. So I'm going to write that as a general principle that the derivative of a to the x with respect to x is equal to ln a times a to the x. This is a fact worth memorizing. I'll use this fact to compute the derivative of this complicated expression, sine of 5x times the square root of two to the cosine 5x plus one. To find dydx, I'll first use the product rule, since our expression is the product of two other expressions. So D y dX is the first expression times the derivative of the second expression, which I'll go ahead and write using an exponent instead of a square root sign, plus the derivative of the first expression times the second expression. Now I'll need to use the chain rule to evaluate the derivative here. My outermost function is the function that raises everything to the one half power. So when I take the derivative, I can use the power rule, bring down the one half, right to the cosine 5x plus one to the negative one half. But then by the chain rule, I'm going to have to multiply by the derivative of the inner function, which is to to the cosine 5x plus one, I'll just carry along the rest of my expression for now, what I want to take the derivative of two to the cosine 5x plus one, I'm going to have to use the chain rule again, thinking of my outer function as being two to the power plus one. So let me copy things down on the next line. Now taking the derivative, the derivative of one is just zero, so I'm really just taking the derivative of two to the cosine 5x. And by my formula, this is going to be ln f two times two This video introduced the chain rule, which says that the derivative of f composed with g at x is equal to f prime at g of x times g prime at x, or equivalently, d y dx is equal to d y d u times d u dx. This video gives some more examples and a justification of the chain rule, and also includes a handy formula for the derivative of a to the x with respect to x, where A is any positive number. In the next example, I want to show using the chain rule that the derivative of five to the x is equal to ln five times five to the x. First, I want to rewrite five to the x as easily ln five times x. And I can do that because e to the ln five is equal to five. So e to the ln five to the x power is equal to five to the x. But e to the ln five to the x power using exponent rules is just e to the ln five times x. So if I want to take the derivative of five to the x, after rewriting it as e to the ln five times x, let me think of the inner function as being ln five times x. And I'm going to think of the outer function as being E to that power. That's what I wanted to Make the derivative of. So by the chain rule, I can first take the derivative of the outer function, derivative of e to the power is just e to the power, and I evaluate it at its inner function. But then by the chain rule, I need to take the derivative of the inner function, well, the derivative of ln five times x is just the constant coefficient ln five. And that's my derivative. Now, I know that e to the ln five times x is just five to the x. That's what we talked about before. So my final answer is five to the x times ln five, or I guess I can rewrite that in the other order. That is that there's nothing special about five in this example, I could have done this same process with any a base positive base a. So I'm going to write that as a general principle that the derivative of a to the x with respect to x is equal to ln a times a to the x. This is a fact worth memorizing. I'll use this fact to compute the derivative of this complicated expression, sine of 5x times the square root of two to the cosine 5x plus one. To find dydx, I'll first use the product rule, since our expression is the product of two other expressions. So D y dX is the first expression times the derivative of the second expression, which I'll go ahead and write using an exponent instead of a square root sign, plus the derivative of the first expression times the second expression. Now I'll need to use the chain rule to evaluate the derivative here. My outermost function is the function that raises everything to the one half power. So when I take the derivative, I can use the power rule, bring down the one half, right to the cosine 5x plus one to the negative one half. But then by the chain rule, I'm going to have to multiply by the derivative of the inner function, which is to to the cosine 5x plus one, I'll just carry along the rest of my expression for now, what I want to take the derivative of two to the cosine 5x plus one, I'm going to have to use the chain rule again, thinking of my outer function as being two to the power plus one. So let me copy things down on the next line. Now taking the derivative, the derivative of one is just zero, so I'm really just taking the derivative of two to the cosine 5x. And by my formula, this is going to be ln f two times two to the power of cosine 5x. But of course, I have to use the chain rule to the power of cosine 5x. But of course, I have to use the chain rule and multiply by that the derivative of the inner function here, which is cosine 5x. Again, I'm just going to carry the rest of the expression along with me for the ride for now. Now we're taking the derivative of cosine 5x, I think of cosine as the outer function. And five times x is the inner function. Similarly, down here, sign is the outer function, and 5x is the inner function. So I can complete my work by copying a lot of stuff down, and now taking the derivative of cosine, which is minus sine, evaluated at its inner function, times the derivative of the inner function 5x, which is just five. And I'm going to add to that the derivative of sine of 5x. Well, the derivative of sine is cosine, evaluated on its inner function times the derivative of the inner function 5x, which is just five times the rest of the stuff. I'll do a modest amount of simplification, maybe bring the constants out and combine any terms that I can. And that's the end of that complicated example. And the next example, we'll try to find the derivative of a composition at the value x equals one just based on a table of values. So the chain rule says that the derivative of f composed with g is just going to be f prime evaluated g of x times g prime evaluated x, but I want to do this whole process at x equals one. So that's just going to be f prime at g of one times g prime of one. Well, g of one is two. So I really want f prime at two, and f prime at two is 10. And g prime at one is negative five. So my answer is negative 50. I'm not going to give a rigorous proof of the chain rule. But I would like to give a more informal explanation based on the limit definition of derivative. So I'm going to write the derivative of f composed with g evaluated a point A, as the limit as x goes to a of f composed with g of x minus f composed with g of A divided by x minus a. I'll rewrite this slightly. And now we're going to multiply the top and the bottom by g of x minus g of a, that doesn't change the value of expression, provided that g of x minus g of A is not zero. That's the detail on sweeping under the rug here and why this is not a real proof, but just a more informal explanation. Now if I rearrange things, and rewrite the limit of the product as the product of the limits, my limit on the right here is just the derivative of g. for the limit on the left, notice that as x goes to a, g of x has to go to g of a, since G is differentiable on there for continuous function. So I can rewrite this and letting say u be equal to g of x, I can rewrite this as the limit as u goes to g of a of f of u minus f of g of A over u minus g of a. Now my expression on the left is just another way of writing the derivative of f evaluated at g of a. And I've arrived at the expression for the chain rule. Let me just emphasize again, this is just a pseudo proof, it's not quite airtight, because g of x minus g of a might be zero. In this video, we saw some more examples of the chain rule justification of it. And we saw that the derivative respect to x and multiply by that the derivative of the inner function here, which is cosine 5x. Again, I'm just going to carry the rest of the expression along with me for the ride for now. Now we're taking the derivative of cosine 5x, I think of cosine as the outer function. And five times x is the inner function. Similarly, down here, sign is the outer function, and 5x is the inner function. So I can complete my work by copying a lot of stuff down, and now taking the derivative of cosine, which is minus sine, evaluated at its inner function, times the derivative of the inner function 5x, which is just five. And I'm going to add to that the derivative of sine of 5x. Well, the derivative of sine is cosine, evaluated on its inner function times the derivative of the inner function 5x, which is just five times the rest of the stuff. I'll do a modest amount of simplification, maybe bring the constants out and combine any terms that I can. And that's the end of that complicated example. And the next example, we'll try to find the derivative of a composition at the value x equals one just based on a table of values. So the chain rule says that the derivative of f composed with g is just going to be f prime evaluated g of x times g prime evaluated x, but I want to do this whole process at x equals one. So that's just going to be f prime at g of one times g prime of one. Well, g of one is two. So I really want f prime at two, and f prime at two is 10. And g prime at one is negative five. So my answer is negative 50. I'm not going to give a rigorous proof of the chain rule. But I would like to give a more informal explanation based on the limit definition of derivative. So I'm going to write the derivative of f composed with g evaluated a point A, as the limit as x goes to a of f composed with g of x minus f composed with g of A divided by x minus a. I'll rewrite this slightly. And now we're going to multiply the top and the bottom by g of x minus g of a, that doesn't change the value of expression, provided that g of x minus g of A is not zero. That's the detail on sweeping under the rug here and why this is not a real proof, but just a more informal explanation. Now if I rearrange things, and rewrite the limit of the product as the product of the limits, my limit on the right here is just the derivative of g. for the limit on the left, notice that as x goes to a, g of x has to go to g of a, since G is differentiable on there for continuous function. So I can rewrite this and letting say u be equal to g of x, I can rewrite this as the limit as u goes to g of a of f of u minus f of g of A over u minus g of a. Now my expression on the left is just another way of writing the derivative of f evaluated at g of a. And I've arrived at the expression for the chain rule. Let me just emphasize again, this is just a pseudo proof, it's not quite airtight, because g of x minus g of a might be zero. In this video, we saw some more examples of the chain rule justification of it. And we saw that the derivative respect to x of A to the X is equal to ln of a times a to the x. This video gives an explanation for why the chain rule holds. of A to the X is equal to ln of a times a to the x. This video gives an explanation for why the chain rule holds.

Now if I rearrange things, and rewrite the limit of the product as the product of the limits, my limit on the right here is just the derivative of g. for the limit on the left, notice that as x goes to a, g of x has to go to G evey, since G is differentiable on there for a continuous function, so I can rewrite this and letting say u be equal to g of x, I can rewrite this as the limit as u goes to g of a of f of u minus f of g of A So I'm going to write the derivative of f composed with g evaluated a point A, as the limit as x goes to a of f composed with g of x minus f composed with g of A divided by x minus a. I'll rewrite this slightly. And now we're going to multiply the top and the bottom by g of x minus g of a, that doesn't change the value of expression, provided that g of x minus g of A is not zero.

Now my expression on the left is just another way of writing the derivative of f evaluated at G Ave. And I've arrived at the expression for the chain rule. Let me just emphasize again, this is just a pseudo proof it's not quite airtight because g of x minus g of a might be zero. That's all for the justification of the chain rule. For a complete proof. Please see the textbook implicit differentiation is a technique for finding the slopes of tangent lines for curves that are defined indirectly, and sometimes aren't even functions. So far, we've developed a lot of techniques for finding derivatives of functions defined explicitly, in terms of the equation y equals something. In this section, we'll consider curves that are defined implicitly, in terms of any equation involving x's and y's. So the points on this curve are the values of x and y that satisfy this equation. As you can see, when you have implicitly defined curves, they are not necessarily functions. And in fact, they can not only violate the vertical line test, but they can cross themselves, or be broken up into several pieces or look like really cool pictures like this flower. But small pieces of these curves do satisfy the vertical line test for small pieces, y is a function of x. And that allows us to use our calculus techniques, especially the chain rule, to compute derivatives for these implicitly defined curves. u minus g of a. Now my expression on the left is just another way of writing the derivative of f evaluated at G Ave. And I've arrived at the expression for the chain rule.

And that allows us to use our calculus techniques, especially the chain rule, to compute derivatives for these implicitly defined curves. As usual, the derivative dy dx represents the slope of a tangent line. For our first example, let's find the equation of the tangent line for the lips 9x squared plus four y squared equals 25. drawn below at the point, one, two. From the picture, it looks like the slope of this tangent line should be about negative one, but let's use calculus to find it exactly. So there are at least two ways we could proceed. First, we could solve for y, and then use the same techniques that we've been using. So if we solve for y, we get for y squared equals 25 minus 9x squared. So y squared is 25 minus 9x squared over four, which means that y is plus or minus the square root of 25 minus 9x squared over four, or in other words, plus or minus the square root of 25 minus 9x squared over two, the plus answer is giving us the top half of the ellipse. And the minus answer is giving us this bottom. Since the point one, two is on the top part of the ellipse, let's focus on the positive version. And let's take the derivative. But first, let me rewrite one more time to put it in a slightly easier form, instead of dividing by two, I'm going to think of multiplying by the constant one half. And instead of taking the square root, I'm going to write that as an exponent of one half here. So now if I want to take the y dx, I can pull out the constant of one half. And now I'll start using the chain rule where my outer function As usual, the derivative dy dx represents the slope of a tangent line. For our first example, let's find the equation of the tangent line for the lips 9x squared plus four y squared equals 25. drawn below at the point, one, two. From the picture, it looks like the slope of this tangent line should be about negative one, but let's use calculus to find it exactly. So there are at least two ways we could proceed. First, we could solve for y, and then use the same techniques that we've been using. So if we solve for y, we get for y squared equals 25 minus 9x squared. So y squared is 25 minus 9x squared over four, which means that y is plus or minus the square root of 25 minus 9x squared over four, or in other words, plus or minus the square root of 25 minus 9x squared over two, the plus answer is giving us the top half of the ellipse. And the minus answer is giving us this bottom. Since the point one, two is on the top part of the ellipse, let's focus on the positive version. And let's take the derivative. But first, let me rewrite one more time to put it in a slightly easier form, instead of dividing by two, I'm going to think of multiplying by the constant one half. And instead of taking the square root, I'm going to write that as an exponent of one half here. So now if I want to take the y dx, I can pull out the constant of one half. And now I'll start using the chain rule where my outer function is is taking things to the one half power, and my inner function is 25 minus 9x squared. So I'll take the derivative of my outer function by bringing the one half down, taking the inner function to the negative one half. Now I multiply by the derivative of the inner function, which is negative 18x. If I simplify a little bit, I get D y dX is negative 18x over four times 25 minus 9x squared to the one half power, or in other words, dy dx is negative 9x over two times the square root of 25 minus 9x squared. This formula only holds for the top half of the ellipse for the bottom half, we would need to use the negative. Now I want to evaluate the derivative at the point one, two, so I'm going to take dydx. When x equals one, I get negative nine over two times the square root of 25 minus nine, which is negative nine eighths. Since I've found the slope of the tangent line, and I know that point one, two is a point on the tangent line, I can now use the point slope form to write down the equation of the tangent line. simplified this becomes y equals negative nine is x plus nine eights plus two, or y equals negative nine, it's x plus 25. It's now that we've solved the problem once using a familiar method. Let's go back to the beginning and solve it again using a new method. method two is implicit differentiation. The idea is that I'm going to take the derivative with respect to x of both sides. If my equation without having to solve for y, I can rewrite the left side as nine times the derivative of x squared plus four times the derivative of y squared. And the right side, the derivative of a constant is zero. Going back to the left side, the derivative of x squared with respect to x is 2x. Now for the derivative of y squared with respect to x, I'm going to need to use the chain rule, I'm going to think of taking the squared power as my outside function, I'm going to think of y itself as my inside function, my inside function of x. Even though my entire curve is not a function, for small pieces of it, y is a function of x, so I can get away with doing this, the derivative of my outside function y squared is to y, and the derivative of my inside function, y as a function of x is just dydx. Now I can solve for dy dx, which is going to tell me the slope of my tangent line. And so I get negative 18x from here, divided by eight y from here, which simplifies to negative nine fourths times X over Y. Notice that the formula for my derivative dydx has both x's and y's in it. Of course, for this problem, if I wanted to, I could solve for y in terms of x using the original equation like I did in method one, and plug that in for y and get an expression entirely in terms of x, which should be the same as the expression I got previously. taking things to the one half power, and my inner function is 25 minus 9x squared. So I'll take the derivative of my outer function by bringing the one half down, taking the inner function to the negative one half. Now I multiply by the derivative of the inner function, which is negative 18x. If I simplify a little bit, I get D y dX is negative 18x over four times 25 minus 9x squared to the one half power, or in other words, dy dx is negative 9x over two times the square root of 25 minus 9x squared. This formula only holds for the top half of the ellipse for the bottom half, we would need to use the negative. Now I want to evaluate the derivative at the point one, two, so I'm going to take dydx. When x equals one, I get negative nine over two times the square root of 25 minus nine, which is negative nine eighths. Since I've found the slope of the tangent line, and I know that point one, two is a point on the tangent line, I can now use the point slope form to write down the equation of the tangent line. simplified this becomes y equals negative nine is x plus nine eights plus two, or y equals negative nine, it's x plus 25. It's now that we've solved the problem once using a familiar method. Let's go back to the beginning and solve it again using a new method. method two is implicit differentiation. The idea is that I'm going to take the derivative with respect to x of both sides. If my equation without having to solve for y, I can rewrite the left side as nine times the derivative of x squared plus four times the derivative of y squared. And the right side, the derivative of a constant is zero. Going back to the left side, the derivative of x squared with respect to x is 2x. Now for the derivative of y squared with respect to x, I'm going to need to use the chain rule, I'm going to think of taking the squared power as my outside function, I'm going to think of y itself as my inside function, my inside function of x. Even though my entire curve is not a function, for small pieces of it, y is a function of x, so I can get away with doing this, the derivative of my outside function y squared is to y, and the derivative of my inside function, y as a function of x is just dydx. Now I can solve for dy dx, which is going to tell me the slope of my tangent line. And so I get negative 18x from here, divided by eight y from here, which simplifies to negative nine fourths times X over Y. Notice that the formula for my derivative dydx has both x's and y's in it. Of course, for this problem, if I wanted to, I could solve for y in terms of x using the original equation like I did in method one, and plug that in for y and get an expression entirely in terms of x, which should be the same as the expression I got previously. But I don't really But I don't really need to do that in order to solve this problem. Instead, I can just plug in the x value of one and the y value of two to get dy dx at x equals one, equal to negative nine fourths, times one half or negative nine, eight, which we'll recognize as the same answer we got before. So as before, we can compute the equation for the tangent line. And we'll again get y equals negative nine 8x plus 25, eights. In this example, implicit differentiation was a convenient way to find the derivative. But it was possible to solve for y and use standard methods instead. But in many examples, like the next one, it's not possible to solve for y directly. And so implicit differentiation is the only way to go. implicit differentiation is definitely the key to finding y prime for this curve defined implicitly. So again, the idea is to take the derivative of both sides with respect to x, I can break this up into pieces. And now use the product rule for the first piece. So I get the first function x cubed times the derivative of the second function y squared, the derivative of y squared is to y, d y dx, don't forget the dydx there, because y is a function of x plus the derivative of the first part 3x squared times the second part need to do that in order to solve this problem. Instead, I can just plug in the x value of one and the y value of two to get dy dx at x equals one, equal to negative nine fourths, times one half or negative nine, eight, which we'll recognize as the same answer we got before. So as before, we can compute the equation for the tangent line. And we'll again get y equals negative nine 8x plus 25, eights. In this example, implicit differentiation was a convenient way to find the derivative. But it was possible to solve for y and use standard methods instead. But in many examples, like the next one, it's not possible to solve for y directly. And so implicit differentiation is the only way to go. implicit differentiation is definitely the key to finding y prime for this curve defined implicitly. So again, the idea is to take the derivative of both sides with respect to x, I can break this up into pieces. And now use the product rule for the first piece. So I get the first function x cubed times the derivative of the second function y squared, the derivative of y squared is to y, d y dx, don't forget the dydx there, because y is a function of x plus the derivative of the first part 3x squared times the second part y squared. y squared. Next, I need to take the derivative of sine x, y on the do use the chain rule here. So the derivative of the outside sine is cosine. And now I need to take the derivative of the inside x times y. And that's going to be a product rule application. So x times D y dX, plus the derivative of x, which is just one times y. That all was just my left hand side. But fortunately, my right hand side is easier. The derivative of x cubed with respect to x is 3x squared. And the derivative of y cubed with respect to x is three y squared, dy dx. Now I need to solve for the y dx. And since it's scattered all over the place in three different places, I'm first going to distribute out to free it from these parentheses, and then I'll try to move all the dydx is to the left side. So distributing out I get, I get this expression. And now moving alternatives with dydx and add them to the left side and all terms without dydx mm to the right side. I'm going to get this expression here. Now I'm going to factor out the dy dx. I'm just using standard algebra techniques here. And finally, I can just divide both sides by all this mess, too. isolate the dydx. And I found my derivative using implicit differentiation. This video talked about using implicit differentiation to find the slopes of tangent lines for curves defined implicitly, the main two steps, were first to take the derivative of both sides with respect to x. And then to solve for dy dx. This video is about finding the derivatives of exponential functions, we've already seen that the derivative of the exponential function, e to the x is just itself, e to the x. But what's the derivative of an exponential function with a different base, like five to the x, one way to find the derivative of an exponential function like five to the X is to write five as e to a power. So five, is the same thing as e to the ln five, where ln is the natural log or the log base. See, this makes sense because ln five, which is the same thing as log base e of five, means the power that we raise E to to get five. So now if we take e to the ln five, that means we raise e to the power that we raise E to to get five? Well, when you raise E to that power, you get five. All right, if five is the same thing as e to the ln five, then that means if we take five to the x, that's the same thing as e to the ln five raised to the x power BI properties of exponents, when I take a power to a power, I multiply the exponents. so this can be written as e to the ln five times x. Now I want to take the derivative with respect to x of five to the x. So by my rewriting trick, that's the same thing as taking the derivative with respect to x of e to the ln five times x. Now we know how to calculate this using the chain rule, we can think of e to the power as our outside function, and ln five times x as our inside function. So now by the chain rule, I take the derivative of the outside function e to the power, and that's just gives me e to the power evaluated on the inside function. So I stick ln five times x as my inside function, and by the chain rule, I multiply that by the derivative of the inside function, ln five times x. Five is a constant. So let me copy over first part, the derivative of a constant times x is just the constant. Let me rewrite this a little bit. So e to the ln five times x is the same thing as e to the ln five to the x power, just like before, because the exponent rules say, when I take a power to a power, I multiply the exponent, and remember, is the LL five, it's just a fancy way of writing five. So I've got five to the x times ln five as the derivative with respect to x of five to the x. The same argument works not just for a base five exponential function, but for any base exponential function. So if I take the respect to x of A to the X for any number A, I'm going to get Next, I need to take the derivative of sine x, y on the do use the chain rule here. So the derivative of the outside sine is cosine. And now I need to take the derivative of the inside x times y. And that's going to be a product rule application. So x times D y dX, plus the derivative of x, which is just one times y. That all was just my left hand side. But fortunately, my right hand side is easier. The derivative of x cubed with respect to x is 3x squared. And the derivative of y cubed with respect to x is three y squared, dy dx. Now I need to solve for the y dx.

So I've got five to the x times ln five as the derivative with respect to x of five to the x. The same argument works not just for a base five exponential function, but for any base exponential function. So if I take the respect to x of A to the X for any number A, I'm going to get a to the x times ln A. Now, you might be wondering, what if I use the same roll on our old favorite e to the x. So our base here is E. That means I should get e to the x times ln e? Wait a sec, ln E, that's log base e of E, that's asking what power? Do I raise II today get he? Well, the answer there is one. And so the derivative respect to x of e to the x by this new rule we have is e to the x, it agrees with our old rule. I want to draw your attention to the difference between two expressions. And the first expression, dy dx of a to the x, the variable that we're taking the derivative with respect to is in the exponent. So for this exponential function, or we use the derivative rule that we just found, dy dx of a dx is eight of the x times ln A. On the other hand, if we take respect to x of x to the A, where the variable x that we're taking the derivative with respect to is in the base, then we don't need this exponential rule. In fact, it doesn't even apply, although we have here is the power rule, right? dy dx of x cubed would be 3x squared dy dx of x to the seventh would be 7x to the sixth and enjoy Add x of x to the a is just a times x to the A minus one by the power role. So it's important to pay attention to where the variable is when you're taking a derivative. In this video, we found that the derivative with respect to x of five to the x is given by ln five times five to the x. And in general, the derivative of respect to x of A to the X is going to be ln a times a to the x. This gives us a general formula for the derivative of exponential functions. The main goal of this video is to figure out the derivatives of logarithmic functions, functions like y equals ln x, or y equals log base A x for any positive base a, I want to find the derivative of log base a of x. In other words, I want to find the derivative of y, where y is log base a of x. By the definition of logarithms, log base a of x equals y means that a to the Y power is equal to x. And that's useful because now I can take the derivative of both sides and use implicit differentiation. Recall of the derivative of a to the power is ln A times A to the power. But since why we're thinking of as a function of x, I have to multiply that by dou y dx by the chain rule. The right hand side here is just one. Solving for dydx, I get one over ln A times A to the Y. But since age the y is equal to x, I can rewrite that as the y dx equals one over ln A times x. So the derivative of log base a of x for any base a is one over ln of A times x. And in particular, the derivative of natural log of x is one over ln of E times x. But since ln of E is just one, that saying that the derivative of ln x is one over x, this is a very handy fact. And this more general derivative is also worth memorizing. While we're talking about the derivative of the natural log of x, let's look at the derivative of the natural log of the absolute value of x. The function y equals ln of absolute value of x is of course closely related to the function y equals ln of x, the difference being that the domain for ln x is just x values greater than zero, whereas the domain of ln of absolute value of x is all X's not equal to zero. The graphs are also related. When you look at the graph of y equals ln absolute value of x, it looks like you're seeing double since the absolute value of x is equal to x, when x is greater than or equal to zero and negative x when x is less than zero, ln of the absolute value of x is going to be equal to ln x when x is greater than or equal to zero, and ln of negative x when x is less than zero. If I consider the derivative of ln of absolute value of x, I can think of taking the derivative of each piece separately. We just saw that the derivative of ln x is one over x. So the derivative of ln of minus x is going to be one over minus x times the derivative of minus x, which is minus one by the chain rule. Notice that this second expression simplifies to one over x. So the derivative of ln of absolute value of x is equal to one over x, whether x is positive or negative. This formula will come in handy later when we start doing integrals. In this video, we found that the derivative of ln x is equal to one over x, kind of a nice derivative. And more generally, the derivative of log base a of x is one over ln A times x. We've seen previously that the derivative of x to a constant A is equal to a times x to the A minus one. This is the power rule. We've also seen that the derivative of a positive number a raised to the x power is equal to ln A times A to the X So we know how to take the derivative when the variable x is in the base, or when it's in the exponent. But what if the variables in both the base and the exponent, how do we take the derivative of x to the x. To differentiate functions like this, we'll need to use the technique of logarithmic differentiation. To find the derivative of x to the x, I'm going to set y equal to x to the x. Now we want to find dy dx. Since we don't know how to compute dydx directly, so let's take the natural log of both sides. taking the log is often a handy trick when you have a variable in the exponent that you don't know how to deal with, because the properties of logs allow us to bring that exponent down and multiply it. Now we have y implicitly defined in terms of x, so let's use implicit differentiation, we'll take the derivative of both sides with respect to x. And now we should have no trouble taking the derivatives because we've gotten rid of the awkward exponential expression. So the derivative on the left of ln y is one over y times dy dx. And the derivative on the right using the product rule is x times one over x plus one times ln x. a to the x times ln A. Now, you might be wondering, what if I use the same roll on our old favorite e to the x. So our base here is E. That means I should get e to the x times ln e? Wait a sec, ln E, that's log base e of E, that's asking what power? Do I raise II today get he? Well, the answer there is one.

Now we have y implicitly defined in terms of x, so let's use implicit differentiation, we'll take the derivative of both sides with respect to x. And now we should have no trouble taking the derivatives because we've gotten rid of the awkward exponential expression. So the derivative on the left of ln y is one over y times dy dx. And the derivative on the right using the product rule is x times one over x plus one times ln x. This simplifies to one over y d y dx equals one plus ln x. So D y dX is going to equal y times one plus ln x. and replacing y with x to the x, I have dy dx is x to the x times one plus ln x. This technique of taking the log of both sides differentiating and solving for dydx is known as logarithmic differentiation. And it's enormously useful whenever you have variables in both the base and the exponent. Here's another example where our variable is in both the base and the exponent. So as before, I'm going to set y equal to the expression that I want to differentiate and compute dydx. First, I'll take the log of both sides. Use my log rules to bring my exponent down and multiply it and take the derivative of both sides with respect to x. On the left, I get one over y d y dx. And on the right, I get one of our x times the derivative of ln tangent x, which is one over tangent x times the derivative of tangent x, or secant squared x, continuing with the product rule, and didn't take the derivative of one of our x, that's going to be the derivative of x to the minus one, which is minus one times x to the minus This simplifies to one over y d y dx equals one plus ln x. So D y dX is going to equal y times one plus ln x. and replacing y with x to the x, I have dy dx is x to the x times one plus ln x. This technique of taking the log of both sides differentiating and solving for dydx is known as logarithmic differentiation. And it's enormously useful whenever you have variables in both the base and the exponent. Here's another example where our variable is in both the base and the exponent. So as before, I'm going to set y equal to the expression that I want to differentiate and compute dydx. First, I'll take the log of both sides.

Simplifying the right hand side, I get one over x times one over sine x over cosine x times one over cosine squared x minus ln 10x over x squared. rewriting, I can flip and multiply to get one over x times cosine x over sine x times one over cosine squared x minus the second term, canceling one copy of cosine and rewriting in terms of cosecant and secant, I get this expression, I still have to solve for dy dx. times ln tangent of x. Simplifying the right hand side, I get one over x times one over sine x over cosine x times one over cosine squared x minus ln 10x over x squared. rewriting, I can flip and multiply to get one over x times cosine x over sine x times one over cosine squared x minus the second term, canceling one copy of cosine and rewriting in terms of cosecant and secant, I get this expression, I still have to solve for dy dx. So multiplying both sides by y, I get the following. And since y was equal to 10x to the one over x, I can rewrite everything in terms of x. The technique of logarithmic differentiation is most useful when taking the derivative of an expression that has a variable in both the base and the exponent, like in this example, but sometimes it's also handy just as a way to take the derivative of a complicated product and quotient like in this example. Now, we could take the derivative here just by using the quotient rule on the product rule, but it's a little easier to take the log of both sides. And the reason is that when we take the log of a product, we get a sum and the log of a quotient is a difference and sums and quotients are a lot easier to deal with. So in this example, the log of y is equal to ln of x plus ln of cosine of x minus ln of x squared plus x to the fifth power, I can even bring that fifth power down, because that's another one of my log roles. Now, it's much more straightforward to take the log of both sides. On the left, I have one over y dydx, as usual, and on the right, the derivative of ln x is one over x, the derivative of ln cosine x is one over cosine of x times negative sine of x. And the derivative of ln x squared plus x is one over x squared plus x times 2x plus one. I'll solve for dydx and get y times one over x minus sine x over cosine x, that's the same as tangent x minus five times 2x plus one over x squared plus x. Now I can just rewrite y in terms of x and I'll be done. Again, I didn't have to use logarithmic differentiation. To find this derivative, I could have just used the product rule in the quotient rule, but logarithmic differentiation made it computationally much easier. In this video, we learned how to take the derivative of expressions that have a variable both in the base and in the exponent. And the idea was first to set y equal to the expression we want to derive. Next, to take the natural log of both sides. Next, to derive both sides. And finally, to solve for dy dx. This process is called logarithmic differentiation. The inverse of a function undoes what the function does, so the inverse of tying your shoes would be to untie them. And the inverse of the function that adds two to a number would be the function that subtracts two from a number. This video introduces inverses and their properties. Suppose f of x is the function defined by this chart. In other words, f of two is three, f of three is five, f of four is six, and f of five is one, the inverse function for F written f superscript. Negative 1x undoes what f does. Since f takes two to three, F inverse takes three back to two. So we write this f superscript, negative one of three is two. Similarly, since f takes three to five, F inverse takes five to three. And since f takes four to six, f inverse of six is four. And since f takes five to one, f inverse of one is five. I'll use these numbers to fill in the chart. Notice that the chart of values when y equals f of x and the chart of values when y equals f inverse of x are closely related. They share the same numbers, but the x values for f of x correspond to the y values for f inverse of x, and the y values for f of x correspond to the x values for f inverse of x. That leads us to the first key fact inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x. I'm going to plot the points for y equals f of x in blue. So multiplying both sides by y, I get the following. And since y was equal to 10x to the one over x, I can rewrite everything in terms of x. The technique of logarithmic differentiation is most useful when taking the derivative of an expression that has a variable in both the base and the exponent, like in this example, but sometimes it's also handy just as a way to take the derivative of a complicated product and quotient like in this example.

On the left, I have one over y dydx, as usual, and on the right, the derivative of ln x is one over x, the derivative of ln cosine x is one over cosine of x times negative sine of x. And the derivative of ln x squared plus x is one over x squared plus x times 2x plus one. I'll solve for dydx and get y times one over x minus sine x over cosine x, that's the same as tangent x minus five times 2x plus one over x squared plus x. Now I can just rewrite y in terms of x and I'll be done. Again, I didn't have to use logarithmic differentiation. To find this derivative, I could have just used the product rule in the quotient rule, but logarithmic differentiation made it computationally much easier.

This process is called logarithmic differentiation. The inverse of a function undoes what the function does, so the inverse of tying your shoes would be to untie them. And the inverse of the function that adds two to a number would be the function that subtracts two from a number. This video introduces inverses and their properties. Suppose f of x is the function defined by this chart. In other words, f of two is three, f of three is five, f of four is six, and f of five is one, the inverse function for F written f superscript. Negative 1x undoes what f does. Since f takes two to three, F inverse takes three back to two. So we write this f superscript, negative one of three is two. Similarly, since f takes three to five, F inverse takes five to three. And since f takes four to six, f inverse of six is four. And since f takes five to one, f inverse of one is five. I'll use these numbers to fill in the chart. Notice that the chart of values when y equals f of x and the chart of values when y equals f inverse of x are closely related. They share the same numbers, but the x values for f of x correspond to the y values for f inverse of x, and the y values for f of x correspond to the x values for f inverse of x. That leads us to the first key fact inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x. I'm going to plot the points for y equals f of x in blue. Next, I'll plot the points for y equals f inverse of x in red. Pause the video for a moment and see what kind of symmetry you observe in this graph. How are the blue points related to the red points, you might have noticed that the blue points and the red points are mirror images over the mirror line, y equals x. So our second key fact is that the graph of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained from the graph of y equals f of x by reflecting over the line y equals x. This makes sense, because inverses, reverse the roles of y and x. In the same example, let's compute f inverse of f of two. This open circle means composition. In other words, we're computing f inverse of f of two. We compute this from the inside out. So that's f inverse of three. Since F of two is three, and f inverse of three, we see is two. Similarly, we can compute f of f inverse of three. And that means we take f of f inverse of three. Since f inverse of three is two, that's the same thing as computing F of two, which is three. Please pause the video for a moment and compute these other compositions. You should have found that in every case, if you take f inverse of f of a number, you get back to the very same number you started with. And similarly, if you take f of f inverse of any number, you get back to the same number you started with. So in general, f inverse of f of x is equal to x, and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x. This is the mathematical way of saying that F and envir f inverse undo each other. Let's look at a different example. Suppose that f of x is x cubed. Pause the video for a moment and guess what the inverse of f should be? Remember, F inverse undoes the work that F does. You might have guessed that f inverse of x is going to be the cube root function. And we can check that this is true by looking at f of f inverse of x, that's F of the cube root of function, which means the cube root function cubed, which gets us back to x. Similarly, if we compute f inverse of f of x, that's the cube root of x cubed. And we get back to excellence again. So the cube root function really is the inverse of the cubing function. When we compose the two functions, we get back to the number that we started with. It'd be nice to have a more systematic way of finding inverses of functions besides guessing and checking. One method uses the fact that inverses, reverse the roles of y and x. So if we want to find the inverse of the function, f of x equals five minus x over 3x, we can write it as y equals five minus x over 3x. Reverse the roles of y and x to get x equals five minus y over three y, and then solve for y. To solve for y, let's multiply both sides by three y. Bring all terms with wisened to the left side, and alternans without y's and then to the right side, factor out the y and divide to isolate y. This gives us f inverse of x as five over 3x plus one. Notice that our original function f and our inverse function, f inverse are both rational functions, but they're not the reciprocals of each other. And then General, f inverse of x is not usually equal to one over f of x. This can be confusing, because when we write two to the minus one, that does mean one of our two, but f to the minus one of x means the inverse function and not the reciprocal. It's natural to ask if all functions have inverse functions, that is for any function you might encounter. Is there always a function that it is its inverse? Next, I'll plot the points for y equals f inverse of x in red. Pause the video for a moment and see what kind of symmetry you observe in this graph. How are the blue points related to the red points, you might have noticed that the blue points and the red points are mirror images over the mirror line, y equals x.

In other words, we're computing f inverse of f of two. We compute this from the inside out. So that's f inverse of three. Since F of two is three, and f inverse of three, we see is two. Similarly, we can compute f of f inverse of three. And that means we take f of f inverse of three. Since f inverse of three is two, that's the same thing as computing F of two, which is three. Please pause the video for a moment and compute these other compositions. You should have found that in every case, if you take f inverse of f of a number, you get back to the very same number you started with.

And then General, f inverse of x is not usually equal to one over f of x. This can be confusing, because when we write two to the minus one, that does mean one of our two, but f to the minus one of x means the inverse function and not the reciprocal. It's natural to ask if all functions have inverse functions, that is for any function you might encounter. Is there always a function that it is its inverse? In fact, the answer is no. See, if you can come up with an example of a function that does not have an inverse function. The word function here is key. Remember that a function is a relationship between x values and y values, such that for each x value in the domain, there's only one corresponding y value. One example of a function that does not have an inverse function is the function f of x equals x squared. To see that, the inverse of this function is not a function. Note that for the x squared function, the number two and the number negative two, both go to number four. So if I had an inverse, he would have to send four to both two and negative two. The inverse would not be a function, it might be easier to understand the problem, when you look at a graph of y equals x squared. Recall that inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x and flip the graph over the line y equals x. But when I flipped the green graph over the line y equals x, I get this red graph. This red graph is not the graph of a function, because it violates the vertical line test. The reason that violates the vertical line test is because the original green function violates the horizontal line test, and has 2x values with the same y value. In general, a function f has an inverse function if and only if the graph of f satisfies the horizontal line test, ie every horizontal line intersects the graph. In most one point, pause the video for a moment and see which of these four graphs satisfy the horizontal line test. In other words, which of the four corresponding functions would have an inverse function, you may have found that graphs A and B, violate the horizontal line test. So their functions would not have inverse functions. But graph C and D satisfy the horizontal line test. So these graphs represent functions that do have inverses. functions that satisfy the horizontal line test are sometimes called One to One functions. Equivalent way of function is one to one, if for any two different x values, x one and x two, the y value is f of x one and f of x two are different numbers. Sometimes, as I said, f is one to one, if, whenever f of x one is equal to f of x two, then x one has to equal x two. As our last example, let's try to find P inverse of x, where p of x is the square root of x minus two drawn here. If we graph P inverse on the same axis as p of x, we get the following graph, simply by flipping over the line y equals x. If we try to solve the problem, algebraically, we can write y equal to a squared of x minus two, reverse the roles of y and x and solve for y by squaring both sides and adding two. Now if we were to graph y equals x squared plus two, that would look like a parabola, it would look like the red graph was already drawn together with another arm on the left side. But we know that our actual inverse function consists only of this right arm, we can specify this algebraically by making the restriction that x has to be bigger than or equal to zero. This corresponds to the fact that on the original graph, for the square root of x, y was only greater than or equal to zero. Looking more closely at the domain and range of P and P inverse, we know that the domain of P is all values of x such that x minus two is greater than or equal to zero. Since we can't take the square root of a negative number. This corresponds to x values being greater than or equal to two, or an interval notation, the interval from two to infinity. The range of P, we can see from the graph is our y value is greater than or equal to zero, or the interval from zero to infinity. In fact, the answer is no. See, if you can come up with an example of a function that does not have an inverse function. The word function here is key. Remember that a function is a relationship between x values and y values, such that for each x value in the domain, there's only one corresponding y value. One example of a function that does not have an inverse function is the function f of x equals x squared. To see that, the inverse of this function is not a function.

Looking more closely at the domain and range of P and P inverse, we know that the domain of P is all values of x such that x minus two is greater than or equal to zero. Since we can't take the square root of a negative number. This corresponds to x values being greater than or equal to two, or an interval notation, the interval from two to infinity. The range of P, we can see from the graph is our y value is greater than or equal to zero, or the interval from zero to infinity. Similarly, based on the graph, we see the domain of P inverse is x values greater than or equal to zero, the interval from zero to infinity. And the range of P inverse is Y values greater than or equal to two, or the interval from two to infinity. If you look closely at these domains and ranges, you'll notice that the domain of P corresponds exactly to the range of P inverse, and the range of P corresponds to the domain of P inverse. This makes sense because inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x. The domain of f inverse of x is the x values for F inverse, which corresponds to the y values or the range of F. The range of f inverse is the y values for F inverse, which correspond to the x values or the domain of f. In this video, we discussed Similarly, based on the graph, we see the domain of P inverse is x values greater than or equal to zero, the interval from zero to infinity. And the range of P inverse is Y values greater than or equal to two, or the interval from two to infinity. If you look closely at these domains and ranges, you'll notice that the domain of P corresponds exactly to the range of P inverse, and the range of P corresponds to the domain of P inverse. This makes sense because inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x. The domain of f inverse of x is the x values for F inverse, which corresponds to the y values or the range of F. The range of f inverse is the y values for F inverse, which correspond to the x values or the domain of f. In this video, we discussed five key properties of inverse functions. inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x. The graph of y equals f inverse of x is the graph of y equals f of x reflected over the line y equals x. When we compose F with F inverse, we get the identity function y equals x. And similarly, when we compose f inverse with F, that brings x to x. In other words, F and F inverse undo each other. The function f of x has an inverse function if and only if the graph of y equals f of x satisfies the horizontal line test. And finally, the domain of f is the range of f inverse. And the range of f is the domain of f inverse. These properties of inverse functions will be important when we study exponential functions and their inverses logarithmic functions. This video defines the standard inverse trig functions, sine inverse cosine inverse and tan inverse. In this crazy looking graph, please focus first on the thin black line. This is a graph of y equals sine x. The graph of the inverse of a function can be found by flipping the graph of the original function over the line y equals x. I've drawn the flipped graph with this blue dotted line. But you'll notice that the blue dotted line is not the graph of a function, because it violates the vertical line test. So in order to get a function, that's the inverse of y equals sine x, we need to restrict the domain of sine of x, we'll restrict it to this piece that's drawn with a thick black line. If I invert that piece, by flipping it over the line y equals x, I get the piece drawn with a red dotted line here. And that piece does satisfy the vertical line test. So it is in fact a function. of the regular sine x has domain from negative infinity to infinity, or restricted sine x has domain from negative pi over two to pi over two. It's it's range is still from negative one to one, just like the regular sine x. Because I've taken the biggest possible piece of the graph whose flipped version is still a function. The inverse sine function is often written as arc sine of x. And since inverting a function reverses the roles of y at x, it reverses the domain and the range. So arc sine of x, the inverse function has domain from negative one to one, and range from negative pi over two to pi over two, which seems plausible from the graph. Now an inverse function undoes the work of a function. So if the function sine takes angle theta, two numbers, x, then the inverse sine, or arc sine takes numbers x, two angles theta. For example, since sine of pi over two is one, arc sine of one is pi over two. And in general, the output of arc sine of x is the angle between negative pi over two and pi over two whose side is x. y is equal to arc sine x means that x is equal to sine of y. But since there are many angles, y who sine is x, right, they all differ by multiples of two pi. We specify also, that y is between negative pi over two and pi over two. That was the whole point of doing this domain restriction in order to get a well defined inverse value. There's an alternate notation for inverse sine. Sometimes it's written as sine to the negative one of x. But this notation can be confusing, so be careful. In particular, sine to the negative one of x does not equal one over sine of x. One over sine of x the reciprocal function is another word for cosecant The backs, but sign to the negative one of x is another word for arc sine of x, the inverse sine function, which is not the same thing as the reciprocal function. Let's go through the same process to build an inverse cosine function, we start with a graph of cosine of x, we flip it over the line y equals x to get the blue dotted line. But the blue dotted line is not a function. So we go back and restrict the domain for our original cosine of x to just be between zero and pi. The resulting red graph now satisfies the vertical line test. So it's a proper inverse function. Our restricted cosine has domain from zero to pi, and range from negative one to one. And so our inverse function, arc cosine has domain from negative one to one, and range from zero to pi. Since cosine takes us from angles to numbers, arc cosine takes us from numbers back to angles. For example, cosine of pi over four is the square root of two over two. So arc cosine of the square root of two over two is equal to pi over four. arc cosine of x is the angle between zero and pi, whose cosine is x. In other words, y equals r cosine of x means that x is equal to cosine of y, and y is between zero and pi. Since otherwise, there'd be lots of possible answers for an angle y whose cosine is x. The alternative notation for arc cosine is cosine inverse. And again, we have to be careful. cosine to the negative 1x is not the same thing as one over cosine of x. one over cosine of x is also called secant of x. cosine to the negative 1x means arc cosine, the inverse function, and these two things are not the same. Finally, let's look take a look at inverse tangent function. Here's a graph of tangent and black, these vertical lines aren't really part of the function, they're just vertical asymptotes. So in order to get actual function, when we flip over the line y equals x, we take just one piece of the tangent function. Here we've taken the piece marked in black, we flip that over the line y equals x, we get this piece in red, which is actually a function because it satisfies the vertical line test. Now, you might ask, would it be possible to pick a different piece of the tangent function to invert? And the answer is yes, we could do that. And on another planet, maybe mathematicians do that. But on our planet, we use the convention that we pick this piece of tangent to invert, which is kind of a convenient choice since it's centered here around the origin. In the previous two examples, our choice of restricted domain for sine and for cosine was also a convention that led to a conveniently defined inverse function. In any case, based on our choice, our restricted tan function has domain from negative pi over two to pi over two. We don't include the endpoints in that interval, because our restricted tan function has vertical asymptotes, that negative pi over two pi over two, so it's not defined there. The range of our restricted tan function is from negative infinity to infinity. Therefore, arc tan of X has domain from negative infinity to infinity and range from negative pi over two to pi over two. Once again, tangent is taking us from angles to numbers. So arc tan is taking us from numbers to angles. For example, tangent of pi over four is one, and therefore, arc tan of one is pi over four. So arc tan of x means the angle between negative pi over two and pi over two whose tangent is x. y is equal to arc tan x means that x is equal to tangent of y and the Why is between negative pi over two and pi over two. The inverse tan function can also be written as 10 to the minus one of x. And once again, tan inverse of x means the inverse trig function, arc tan of x. And it's not equal to one over tan of x, which is called cotangent of x. And that's all for this video on the three basic inverse trig functions. sine inverse x, also known as arc sine of x, cosine inverse x, also known as arc cosine x, and tan inverse x, also known as arc tan x. In this video, we'll use implicit differentiation to find the derivatives of the inverse trig functions. First, the inverse sine function. Recall that y equals sine inverse of x means that y is the angle in radians whose sine is x. In other words, we can write x equals sine of y as an almost equivalent statements, I say almost equivalent, because there are lots of different y's whose side is x, lots of different angles can have the same resulting side. And for the inverse sine function, we specify that that angle y has to be between pi over two and negative pi over two, that's just the convention. Be careful not to mistake sine inverse of x, which is an inverse function, and one over sine x, which is a reciprocal function. These are not the same thing. This negative one does not mean reciprocal here, it means inverse function. There is another notation for inverse sine, which is arc sine. So arc sine of x is the same thing as sine inverse of x, we want to find the derivative of sine inverse of x, in other words, the derivative of y with respect to x, where y is sine inverse of x, I'm going to rewrite this equation here as x equals sine y, and then use implicit differentiation. So taking the derivative of both sides with respect to x, I have derivative of x is equal to the derivative of sine y. In other words, one is equal to cosine of y times dy dx. Solving for dydx, I have that dydx is one over cosine of y. Now I found the derivative, but it's not in a super useful form, because there's still a Y and expression, I'd rather have it all in terms of x. Well, I could rewrite this as dy dx is one over cosine of sine inverse of x, since after all, y is equal to sine inverse of x, but that's still not a super useful form, because it's difficult to evaluate this. So instead of doing this, I'm going to look at a right triangle. I want to label my triangle with y and x. Since y is my angle, I'll put it here. And since sine of y is x, and sine is opposite over hypotenuse, I can label my opposite side with x and my hypothesis with one. From this, I can figure out the length of my remaining side, it's going to have to be the square root of one minus x squared by the Pythagorean Theorem. Now I can compute cosine of y just from the triangle. Cosine of y is adjacent overhype hotness, so that's the square root of one minus x squared over one, or just the square root of one minus x squared. I've been implicitly assuming that y is a positive angle between zero and pi over two when I've been drawing this triangle, but you can check that the same formula also works. If y is a negative angle, think of it going down here on the unit circle instead of up here. So now that I have a formula for cosine y in terms of x, I can go back to my derivative and substitute and I get dy dx is one over the square root of one minus x squared. In other words, I found a formula for With the derivative of inverse sine of x, we can carry out a similar process to find the derivative of inverse cosine y equals cosine inverse x means that x is equal to cosine of y. And by convention, y lies between zero and pi. To find the derivative of arc cosine of x, arc cosine is just an alternative notation for cosine inverse, I can write y equals arc cosine of x, and equivalently x equals the cosine of y. And then I want to find dydx. Using implicit differentiation, please pause the video and try it for yourself before going on. So starting with the equation x equals cosine y, we're going to take the derivative of both sides with respect to x. The derivative of x is one, and the derivative of cosine y is negative sine y, dy dx. So d y dx is equal to negative one over sine y. As before, I can draw and label a right triangle, the angle is y. And now I know that x is cosine of y. So I'm going to put x on the adjacent side and one on my partner's leaving the square root of one minus x squared on the opposite side, which means that sine of y, which is opposite overhype hotness, is equal to the square root of one minus x squared. And so dy dx is going to be negative one over the square root of one minus x squared. And I have my formula for the derivative of arc cosine of x. inverse tangent can be handled very similarly. And again, you may want to try it for yourself before watching the video. Y equals inverse tangent of x means that x is tangent of y. And the convention is that y is supposed to lie between negative pi over two and pi over two. Proceeding as before, we write y equals our tan of x and x equals tan of y, take the derivative of both sides. So we get one equals secant squared of y d y dx. Solving for dydx we have one over seacon square root of y. And using our right triangle as before, we can label the angle of as y. Since I know that tangent y is x, and tangent is opposite over adjacent, I'm going to label the opposite side x and the adjacent side one, which gives us a hypothesis of the square root of one plus x squared. Now we know that secant of y is one over cosine of y. So that's going to be hi partners over adjacent. So that's the square root of one plus x squared over one. And so secant squared of y is just the square of this, which is one plus x squared. Now I can substitute into my formula for dy dx, and I get dy dx is one over one plus x squared, which gives me a nice formula for the derivative of inverse tangent. The other inverse trig functions cotesia inverse, seacon inverse and cosequin inverse, have derivatives that can be computed. Similarly, the following table summarizes these results. In some books, you may see absolute value signs around the X for the formulas for inverse secant and inverse cosecant. Of course, when x is positive, this makes no difference. And when x is negative, this discrepancy comes from differences in the convention for the range of y for these inverse trig functions seeking inverse and cosecant numbers. Notice that the derivatives of the inverse trig functions that start with CO, all have negative signs in front of them and are the negatives of the corresponding inverse trig functions without the CO that makes it easier to remember them. You should memorize these formulas. Let's do one example using the formulas that we just found. Let's compute The derivative of tan inverse of A plus x over a minus x, we'll want to use the formula for the derivative of tan inverse x. Now, to compute dydx, for our function, we can use the chain rule, the outside function is tan inverse, whose derivative is one over one plus the inside function squared, we'll need to multiply that by the derivative of the inside function. I'll just copy over the first part and take the derivative of a plus x over a minus x using the quotient rule. So I put the denominator on the bottom and square it. And then I take low times d, hi, the derivative of a plus x with respect to x is just one minus high D low, the derivative of a minus x with respect to x is negative one. I'll simplify my numerator, a minus x, the negative one and the negative sign here cancel, so I get plus a plus x. On the denominator, I have one plus a plus x squared over a minus x squared, multiplied by a minus x squared. canceling in the numerator, I get to a and distributing and the denominator I get a minus x squared plus a plus x squared. If I expand out the denominator, the same simplifies to two a over two A squared plus 2x squared, or just a over a squared plus x squared, which is a pretty nice derivative. So now you know the derivatives of the inverse trig functions. And you also know how to find them using implicit differentiation, if you ever forget them. When two or more quantities are related by an equation, then their rates of change over time are also related. That's the idea behind related rates. And this video gives an example of related rates involving distances. A tornado is 20 miles west of us, heading due east towards Phillips Hall at a rate of 40 miles per hour. you hop on your bike and ride due south at a speed of 12 miles per hour. How fast is the distance between you and the tornado changing after 15 minutes. In a related rates problem, it's always a good idea to draw a picture first, that can help you uncover the geometry of the problem and see how quantities are related. In this problem, we have a right triangle. Because the tornadoes traveling due east and the bicycles traveling due south at right angles. Let's assign variables to the quantities of interest. I'll call the distance between the tornado and Phillips Hall a. Although it starts at 20 miles, it varies with time, and therefore it's a good idea to assign it a letter a variable. I'll use B to refer to the distance between Philips Hall and the bicycle, a quantity that also varies with time. And I'll let c stand for the distance between the tornado and the bicycle. The problem asks us to find how fast this distance is changing. In other words, DC dt. The next step is to write down equations that relate the quantities of interest. In this problem, we know by the Pythagorean Theorem, that a squared plus b squared equals c squared. We're interested in how fast the distance between you and the tornado is changing. That's a rate of change. And the rate at which the bicycle is traveling and the tornado is moving. These are also rates of change. In order to work these rates of change into the problem, I'm going to take the derivative of both sides of this equation with respect to time. That's the third step. So I'm going to take DDT of a squared plus b squared. And that's equal to DDT of C squared. Notice that I'm thinking of a B and C as functions of T here, since they vary over time, on the left side, I get to a times dA DT using the chain rule, plus two B DB dt. And on the right side, I get to see DC dt. Now I can use the information given to me in the problem to plug in numbers and solve for the quantity of interest DC DT since the tornado was moving at a rate of 40 miles per hour The distance between the tornado and Philip's Hall is decreasing at 40 miles per hour. In other words, da dt is negative 40. That negative sign is important here, and comes from the fact that the distance is decreasing. Since the bicycle is moving at 12 miles per hour, the distance between Philips Hall and the bicycle is increasing at a rate of 12 miles per hour. So DBT is positive 12. The quantity is a, b and c are constantly changing. But at the time of interest, t equals 15 minutes or in hours, 0.25 hours, we can figure out what a B and C are. The tornado is starts 20 miles away, but it's moving at a rate of 40 miles per hour. So after a quarter of an hour, it's gone 10 miles, that means after a quarter of an hour, it's only 10 miles away. And so at the time of point two, five hours, a equals 10. The bike is moving at 12 miles per hour. So after a quarter of a mile, it's gone three miles. And so at this time, b equals three. Now using the same equation we started with, we can plug in a and b and solve for C, we know that c squared is going to be 10 squared plus three squared. So C is going to be the square root of 109. Plugging in the numbers into this equation, we get two times 10 times negative 40 plus two times three times 12 equals two times the square root of 109 times DC dt. So DC dt is going to be negative 800 plus 72 over two times a squared of 109, which is approximately negative 35. In other words, the distance between the tornado and us is decreasing at 35 miles per hour, the tornado is gaining on us quickly. These same steps will get you through a variety of related rates problems. A couple of cautionary notes. Don't plug in numbers to send. Any quantities that vary with time should be written as variables, so you can properly take the derivative with respect to time. In addition, be careful to use negative numbers for negative rates of change. That is, for quantities that are decreasing, we wouldn't have gotten the right answer if we hadn't have used a negative 40 for the rate of change of the distance here. In this video, we solved the related rates problem, and found that riding a bicycle may not be the best way to escape a tornado. In this classic related rates problem, water's flowing into a cone shaped tank, and we have to figure out how fast the water is rising. Water flows into a tank at a rate of three cubic meters per minute, the tank is shaped like a cone with a height of four meters, and a radius of five meters at the top, we're supposed to find the rate at which the water level is rising in the tank. When the water height is two meters. we've drawn our picture. Now let's label some quantities of interest. It's fine to use numbers for the quantities that stay fixed throughout the problem. Like the dimensions of the tank. For any quantities that are varying with time, I need to use letters variables to represent those quantities. So the height of the water is varying throughout the problem. I'll call that H. And it might be handy to also talk about the radius of the part of the cone that's filled with water. I'll call that our ultimately I want to find the rate at which the water level is rising. So that's DHD T. Next, I want to write down equations that relate the quantities of interest. From geometry, I know that the volume of a cone is 1/3 times the area of the base times the height. So the volume of water in the cone is going to be 1/3 times pi r squared times h since h is the height of the piece of the code that contains water. And pi r squared is the area of that circular base for that piece of account. I'm calling it the base even though it's at the top. There's one more equation that's going to be handy here that comes from similar triangles. From similar triangles, we know the ratio of sides for the little triangle here is the same as the ratio of sides for the big triangle. In other words, we know that our over h is going to be equal to five over four. I can use this relationship to eliminate one of the variables in this equation. Let's think for a minute which one we want to eliminate. Since we're ultimately interested in finding DHD T, we need to keep the variable h in here. But since we don't have any information about how are you changing, it's a good idea to get rid of the R. So let's solve for r here. And we get r equals five fourths times h, and plug that back into our volume equation. So we get v equals 1/3 pi times five fourths h squared times h. Or in other words, V equals 25/48 pi h cubed. Now we're gonna derive both sides of the equation with respect to time t, to get rates of change into the problem. Remember that we're thinking of the volume of water and the height of water as functions of time t, we get dv dt equals 2548. It's pi times three h squared DHD t. Now let's plug in numbers and solve for the quantity of interest DHD T. From our problem, we know that water's flowing into the tank at a rate of three cubic meters per minute. So dv dt is three, we're asked to find the rate at which the water level is rising when the water height is two meters. So that's when h is two. Plugging in those values and solving for a DHD T, we get d h dt is equal to three divided by 2540. It's pi times three times two squared, which is 12 over 25 pi meters per second, are about point one five meters per second. This video solve the related rates problem involving volume, and use the trick of finding similar triangles to eliminate one variable. In this video, we'll do a related rates problem involving rotation and angles. a lighthouse that's half a mile west of shore, has a rotating light that makes two revolutions per minute in the counterclockwise direction, the shore runs north south, and there's a cave directly east of the lighthouse. How fast is the beam of light moving along the shore at a point one mile north of the cave. we've drawn a picture. Now let's label it with variables for all the quantities that are changing with time, the distance between the lighthouse and the cave that's fixed. So we don't have to put a variable for that. But the distance between the cave and the point on the shore where the light is hitting, that's varying. So I'll call that say x. Since we want to know how fast the beam of light is moving, we're going to want to know how that distance x is changing. In other words, we want to calculate dx dt, when x is one. The high partners of this right triangle made by the beam of light is also changing with time as as the angle here between the beam of light and the East West line, I'll call that angle theta. And the angle up here, I suppose is also changing and call that fee. This angle is the right angle between the East West line and the north south line. So that doesn't change, it's always 90 degrees. Next, we want to write down equations to relate the quantities of interest. Whenever I see a right triangle in a problem, I'm tempted to write down the Pythagorean theorem, which in this case would say one half squared plus x squared equals h squared. But in this particular problem, it doesn't look like that's going to help us much because of a tiger in theory and would relate x and h. But we don't have any information about how H is changing. The only rate of change information given to us is this two revolutions per minute. Two revolutions per minute is indirectly telling us how this angle theta is changing. Because if the light beam is making two revolutions per minute, then since they're two pi radians in a revolution, that amounts to a change of four pi radians per minute for the angle theta. Therefore I'd really like to write down the equation that has to do with theta and x. And from trig, I know that tangent of theta is opposite over adjacent. So I can write down tangent theta equals x divided by one half. Or in other words, tangent theta is 2x. This is the equation that I need that relates x and theta. Now I'm going to derive both sides with respect to time t. And I get second squared theta, d theta dt equals two times dx dt. Next, I can plug in numbers and solve for my quantity of interest, which is dx dt when x equals one. We already figured out from the two revolutions per minute, that d theta dt is four pi. Now secant theta is one over cosine theta. And since cosine theta is adjacent ever had partners, it's reciprocal is high partners over adjacent. So in our picture, that gives us h over one half. Well, when x equals one, H, is going to be the square root of one squared plus a half squared by the Pythagorean Theorem. And we'll divide that by one half. And simplifying, we get the square root of five fourths divided by one half, which ends up as the square root of five. So let's plug these values into our equation involving derivatives. And we get the square root of five squared per second squared times four pi, four d theta dt equals two times dx dt. Solving for dx dt, we get dx dt is five times four pi divided by two, or 10 pi. So what are the units here on dx dt, since our distance has been in miles, and our time is in minutes, this is 10 pi miles per minute. If I want to convert this to more standard units of miles per hour, I can just multiply my 10 pi miles per minute by 60 minutes per hour to get 600 pi miles per hour. That works out to about 1885 miles per hour, which is pretty darn fast. In this related rates problem, we related rotations per minute, to a change in angle per minute. And we use the trig equation to relate angle and side length. solving a right triangle means finding the length of all the sides and the measures of the angles given partial information. In this example, we're given the length of one side and the measure of one angle, plus we know the measure of this right angle is 90 degrees, we need to find the measure of the third angle labeled capital A, and the length of the two sides labeled lowercase b and lowercase C. To find the measure of angle A, let's use the fact that the measures of the three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So that means that 49 degrees plus 90 degrees plus a is equal to 180 degrees. So A is equal to 180 degrees minus 90 degrees minus 49 degrees, which works out to 41 degrees. To find the length of the side D we have a couple of possible options. We could use the fact that tan of 49 degrees, which is opposite over adjacent is B over 23. So b is 23 times tan 49 degrees, which works out to 26.46 units. Alternatively, we could use the fact that tan of 41 degrees is 23 over b since now if we're looking at the angle here 23 is our opposite and B is an adjacent That's a little bit harder to solve algebraically. But we can write B tan 41 degrees equals 23, which means that B is 23 divided by tan 41 degrees. With a calculator that works out again to 26.46. The reason we want to use 10 in this problem and not say sine or cosine is because 10 of say 49 degrees relates, and the unknown side that we're looking for be to the side that we know the measure of, if we had use sine instead, would be saying that sine of 49 is B over C, and we'd have two unknowns, which would make it difficult to solve. Next, to find the side length C, we can have a few options, we could use a trig function again, for example, we could use the cosine of 49 degrees, that's adjacent over hypotenuse, which is 23 oversee. Solving for C, we get that C is 23 over cosine 49, which works out to 35.06 units. Another option would be to use the Pythagorean Theorem to find C. Since we know 23 squared plus b squared equals c squared. In other words, that's 23 squared plus 26.46 squared equals c squared, which means that C is the square root of that song, which works out again, to 35.06. To review, the ideas we used were, the sum of the angles is equal to 180 degrees. We used facts like tangent of an angle being opposite over adjacent and similar facts about sine and cosine. And we use the Pythagorean Theorem. This allowed us to find all the angles and side lengths of the triangle, knowing just the side length of one side and the angle of one of the non right angles to begin with. In this next example, we don't know any of the angles except for the right angle, but we know to have the side lengths. To find the unknown angle theta, we can use the fact that cosine theta is adjacent overhype hotness, so that's 10 over 15. Cosine is a good trig function to use here, because this equation relates our unknown angle to our two known sides. So we just have one unknown in our equation to solve for. To solve for theta, we just take the cosine inverse of 10/15, which is 0.8411 radians, or 48.19 degrees. To find the measure of angle fee, we could use the fact that sine of fee is 10 over 15 and take sine inverse of 10/15. But probably a little easier, let's just use the fact that these three angles do 180 degrees. That tells us that fee plus 90 plus 48.19 is equal to 180. Which means that fee is 41.81. Finally, we can find x either using a trig function, or by using the Pythagorean Theorem. To find it using a trig function, we could write down something like tan of 48.19 degrees is x over 10. To find that using the Tyrion theorem, we'd write down 10 squared plus x squared equals 15 squared. I'll use a Pythagorean theorem and find the x by doing the square root of 15 squared minus 10 squared. That gives me an answer of 11.18. Notice that we use many of the same ideas as in the previous problem. For example, the fact that the sum of the angles is 180. The Pythagorean theorem and the trig functions like tan, sine and cosine, we also use the inverse trig functions to get from an equation like this one to the angle. This video showed how it's possible to find the length of all the sides of a right triangle, and the measures of all the angles given partial information. For example, the measure of one angle and one side or from two sides. This video gives some definitions and facts related to maximum and minimum values. functions. function f of x has an absolute maximum at the x value of C. If f of c is greater than or equal to f of x for all x in the domain of f. The point with x&y coordinates of C FRC is called an absolute maximum point. And the y value f of c is called the absolute maximum value. Now, if I draw a graph of f, the y value f of c is the highest value that that function ever achieves. And an absolute maximum point is just a point where it achieves that maximum value. Now, it's possible for a function to have more than one absolute maximum point, if there happens to be a tie for the highest value. But a function has at most one absolute maximum value. A function f of x has an absolute minimum that x equals C, if f of c is less than or equal to f of x, for all x in the domain of f. In this case, the point c f of c is called an absolute minimum point. And the y value f of c is called the absolute minimum value. In the graph of f of x, f of c is now the lowest point that the function achieves anywhere on its domain, and C SOC, are the coordinates of a point where the function achieves that minimum value. For example, this function has an absolute minimum value of about negative eight has an absolute minimum point with coordinates three, negative eight. If this function stops here, and just has a domain from zero to four, then the function has an absolute maximum value of 10 at the absolute maximum point with coordinates for 10. If however, the function keeps going in this direction, it will not have an absolute maximum value at all. absolute maximum and minimum values can also be called global maximum and minimum values. In addition to absolute maximum mins, we can talk about local maximums. So a function f of x has a local maximum at x equals C. If f of c is greater than or equal to f of x, for all x, near C. By near C, we mean there's some open interval around C for which this was true. For our graph of f, we have a local maximum right here. Even though it's not the highest point anywhere around since there's a higher point up here, this is the highest point in an open interval around see the point C FFC is called a local maximum point. And the y value f FC is called a local maximum value. Similarly, a function f of x has a local minimum at x equals C, if f of c is less than or equal to f of x for all x, near C. And the point c f of c is called a local minimum point. And the y value f of c is called a local minimum value. A function might have many local minimum values. In this example, assuming that the domain is zero to four, we have a local minimum point right here. Because it's the lowest point anywhere nearby. It also happens to be an absolute minimum point. Now turning our attention to local maximums, we have a local maximum point right here with coordinates about one two. Since f of one is as high or higher than f of x for any x value in an open interval around one. In this example, the absolute maximum point of 410 does not count as a local maximum point. Simply because we can't take an open interval on both sides of for the function doesn't exist on the right side. And so for that sort of technical reason, we end up with an absolute maximum point That's not a local maximum point here. local maximum and minimum values can also be called relative maximum and minimum values. Please take a look at this graph and pause the video for a moment to mark all local maximum minimum points, as well as all global, that is absolute maximum points. See if you can find the absolute maximum value and the absolute minimum value for the function. I'm going to mark the local maximum points in green, and the absolute maximum points in red. The function definitely has a local men here. Since this is the lowest point anywhere nearby and then open interval, and there's a local max point here. There's also a local min point here, where the function also hits a low point and open interval. But that local man is also an absolute man. So I'll mark it half green and half red. There's also a local min point here at the point three, two, since this point is the as low or lower than any point in an open interval. And the function is defined in an open interval around three, even though it's discontinuous there. In fact, this point is tied for local minimum, with all the points on this interval here, between two and three, there are as low or lower than all points in an open interval around them. The point 04 doesn't count as a local max, because the function is not defined on the other side of zero. So there's no open interval to to consider. This point is also not an absolute maximum because the function gets higher over here. In fact, as long as this trend continues, the function f of x has no absolute maximum value at all, because its values just keep getting higher and higher as x goes off to infinity. There's one more point that I want to consider. And that's this point here, at three, three and a half. Well, it's tempting to say that f has a local maximum here, it looks like it's the highest point in the ground. But in fact, there is no point here at three 3.5. Right, the functions value at three is actually down here, too. So there's no point here to be a local maximum point. And if you start looking at points really close to that point, those aren't local maximums either, because you can always find a point just a little bit higher as you get closer and closer, but don't quite reach this missing point of three 3.5. So we have all the absolute and local maximum points marked. And now to find the absolute maximum value. Well, we just said that there is none. But the absolute minimum value is the y value of this absolute minimum point here. So I'd say that's about 0.5. Here I've drawn the graph of a function. What do you notice about the derivative of this function at its local maximum and minimum points, please pause the video and think about it. Well, the local maximum minimum points are here, here and here. And at two of those points, the derivative f prime of c equals zero. And that the third point, f prime of c does not exist, because the function has a corner. A number c is called a critical number for a function f if f prime of c does not exist, or f prime of c exists and equals zero. So in other words, all of these local maximum minimum points for this example, they're all critical points. And this is true in general, if f has a local max or min at C, then C must be a critical number for F. We also say that the point c f of c is a critical point for F. It's important not to read too much into this statement. The statement says that if f has a local max or man at C then C must be a critical number. But the converse doesn't hold. In other words, if c is a critical number, then f may or may not have a local max or men at sea. One example to keep in mind is the function f of x equals x cubed at a value of C of zero. Since f prime of x is 3x squared, we have that f prime of zero equals zero. So zero is a critical number. But notice that F does not have a local maximum man at x equals zero. In this video, we defined absolute and local, maximum and minimums. We also defined critical numbers, which are numbers c, where f prime of c equals zero, or f prime of c does not exist. We noted that if f has a local max or min at C, then C is a critical number. But not necessarily advice. In this video, we'll see how the first derivative and the second derivative can help us find local maximums and local minimums for a function. Recall that f of x has a local maximum at x equals C. If f of c is greater than or equal to f of x, for all x, in an open interval around C, F of X has a local minimum at x equals C. If f of c is less than or equal to f of x, for all x, in an open interval around C. In this example, the function f has a local maximum at x equals six at x equals 11. And a local minimum at x equals about 10. We've seen before that if f has a local max or local min at x equals C, then f prime of c is equal to zero or it does not exist. Number C at which f prime of c is zero or does not exist, are called critical numbers. But you have to be careful, because it is possible for F to have a critical number at C. That is a place where if privacy is equal to zero, or does not exist, but not have a local max, or min at x equals C. In fact, this happens in the graph above, at x equals two, since f prime of two is zero, but there's no local max or min there. Please pause the video for a moment and try to figure out what's different about the derivative of f in the vicinity of x equals two, where there's no local max or min, and in the vicinity of x equals 610 and 11 where there are local maxes and mins. Near the critical point at x equals two, the derivative is positive on the left and positive again on the right. But near the local maximums, the derivative is positive on the left and negative on the right. And near the local minimum, the derivative is negative on the left and positive on the right. These observations help motivate the first derivative test for finding local maximums and minimums. The first derivative test says that if f is a continuous function near x equals C, and if c is a critical number, then we can decide if f has a local maximum or minimum at x equals c by looking at the first derivative near x equals C. More specifically, if we know that f prime of x is positive for x less than c, and negative for x greater than c, then our function looks something like this. Or maybe like this, your x equals C, and so we have a local max at x equals C. If on the other hand, f prime of x is negative for x less than c, and positive for x greater than c, then our function looks something like this. Or maybe like this, your x equals C and so we have local men at x equals see. If our first derivative is positive on both sides of C or negative on both sides of C, then we do not have a look All extreme point at all at x equals C. Instead, our graph might look something like this, or maybe like this. The first derivative test is great, because it lets us locate local extreme points just by looking at the first derivative. The second derivative test gives us an alternative for finding local maximum points by using the second derivative. Specifically, the second derivative test tells us that if f is continuous near x equals C, then if f prime of c is equal to zero, and f double prime of c is greater than zero, then f has a local min at x equals C. If on the other hand, f prime of c equals zero, and f double prime of c is less than zero, then f has a local max at x equals C. Note that if f double prime of c is equal to zero, or does not exist, then the second derivative test is inconclusive. We might have a local max or a local man at x equals C, or we might not. So we'd have to use a different method like the first derivative test to find out. In this video, we introduced the first derivative test and the second derivative test, which allow us to determine if a function has a local minimum or a local maximum at a certain value of x. In this video, I'll work through two examples of finding extreme values, that is, maximum values and minimum values of functions. In the first example, we're asked to find the absolute maximum and minimum values for this rational function g of x on the interval from zero to four, these maximum and minimum values could occur at critical numbers in the interior of the interval, or they could occur at the endpoints of the interval. So we'll need to check the critical numbers, and check the endpoints and compare our values. To find the critical numbers, those are the numbers where g prime of x is equal to zero or does not exist. So let's take the derivative g prime of x using the quotient rule. So we get x squared plus x plus two squared on the denominator, and then we have low times d high, the derivative of the numerator is one minus high times the derivative of the denominator, that's 2x plus one. Before we figure out where that zero or doesn't exist, let's simplify it a little bit. So we can multiply out the numerator. I'll distribute the negative sign. And I'll add together like terms in the numerator, I'm just leaving the denominator alone on all these steps. So our simplified numerator is going to be minus x squared plus 2x plus three. Now that I've simplified the derivative, I can figure out where it's equal to zero and where it doesn't exist. Let me clear a little space. Now the only way that g prime of x could not exist, is if the denominator is zero. But on our interval, where x is between zero and 4x squared plus x plus two is always greater than or equal to two. So the denominator is never zero on this interval. In fact, it turns out that x squared plus x plus two is never zero, even if we look outside this interval. And you can check that if you want to use the quadratic formula. But in any case, we don't have to worry about the places where g prime of x does not exist. So we only have to worry where g prime of x is equal to zero. To find where g prime of x is equal to zero, we just have to check where the numerator is equal to zero. So I'll set negative x squared plus 2x plus three equal to zero and multiply both sides there by negative one and a factor I get that x equals three or x equals minus one. So these are my critical numbers. But notice that one of these critical numbers negative one doesn't even lie within my interval, so I don't have to worry about it. All I have to worry about is x equals 3x equals three is one place where my function g could have an absolute maximum or minimum. So let's figure out G's value there by plugging in three for x that evaluates to to 14th, or one set So we've checked the critical numbers. Now let's go ahead and check the endpoints. Those are the point the x values of zero, and four, since our interval is from zero to four. Plugging in, we get that g of zero is negative one half, and g of four is 320 seconds. I sometimes like to make a table of all these candidate values. The candidate x values are 03, and four and the corresponding g of x values we found were negative a half 1/7, and 320 seconds. Now to find the absolute maximum and minimum values, all I have to do is figure out which one of these y values is the biggest and which is the smallest. Well, clearly negative one half is a smallest, so that's the absolute minimum value. And we just need to compare 1/7 and 320 seconds to see which is bigger. Now, 1/7 is the same as 320 firsts, which is going to be bigger than 320 seconds. So one half 1/7 is our absolute max value. We can confirm this by looking at a graph of our function g. Remember, we're just interested in the interval from zero to four. So we're just interested in this section of the graph. And it does look like the minimum value is here at when x equals zero minimum value of negative one half like we found, and the maximum value. Well, I'm not sure exactly where it is from this graph, but it does look like it's somewhere around three. And that is a value of something around 1/7. So the graph does confirm what we found as a more precise answer using calculus. For the next example, let's find the absolute extreme values for the function f of x, which is the absolute value of x minus x squared, on the interval from negative two to two. As before, we can find absolute extreme values by checking first the critical numbers, and then also the endpoints of the interval negative two and two. To find the critical numbers, we need to take the derivative of our function. But because our function involves the absolute value, it's a little tricky to take the derivative. Instead, let's first rewrite f using piecewise notation. Recall that, if we're looking at the absolute value of x, when x is bigger than or equal to zero, absolute value of x is just x. So f of x will be x minus x squared. On the other hand, when x is less than zero, the absolute value of x is negative x. So f of x will be negative x minus x squared. Now to take the derivative, we can take the derivative of each piece. So when x is bigger than zero, I don't want to take the derivative when x equals zero, because there might be funny things happening, you know, a cost per corner, so I'm just gonna worry about when x is bigger than zero, and when x is less than zero, for now, when x is bigger than zero, I can just use the power rule I get one minus 2x is the derivative when x is less than zero, I get negative one minus 2x. And now to find where I have critical numbers, I need to find where f prime of x is equal to zero, or f prime of x does not exist. Well, f prime of x equals zero, where one minus 2x equals zero for x bigger than zero. And where one, negative one minus 2x is equal to zero for x less than zero. So that corresponds to x equal one half for x bigger than zero, and x equals negative one half for x less than zero. So those are my first two critical numbers. And that is they do lie within my interval that I'm interested in. But I also have to worry about where f prime of x does not exist. And the candidate x value for that is where x equals 01 way to convince ourselves the derivative does not exist when x equals zero is to look at the fact that the derivative is very close to one for x values, very close to zero from the right side and very close to negative one for x values from the left side. So the graph of the function is going to have to be sloping down with a slope near negative one for x less than zero and up with a slope near one for x greater than zero, and so it'll end up having a cost per corner there. Also notice that even if I weren't 100% sure that the derivative didn't exist at x equals zero, it's not going to hurt to consider this x equals zero as a possible additional candidate for the absolute max or min value. So I've got my three critical numbers, and my end points are just going to be x equals negative two and x equals two. So let me make a chart of values my x values to consider are negative two, negative one half 01, half and positive two, and my corresponding f of x values are going to be, let's say absolute value of negative two minus negative two squared works out to two minus four, which is negative two, I plug in negative one half, I get one half minus 1/4, which is 1/4. plug in zero, I get zero. and plugging in one half, I get 1/4. And plugging in two, I get negative two again. So now my biggest value is going to be 1/4. So that's my absolute max value, and my smallest value is going to be negative two. So that's my absolute min value, I can confirm what I found looking at the graph. So here I've graphed my function, y equals absolute value of x minus x squared on the interval from negative two to two. And I can see indeed, that my absolute min is going to be a value of negative two, it occurs at two absolute minimum points, and my absolute maximum is going to be a value of about 1/4. And that occurs at two absolute maximum points. And that concludes this video on finding extreme values. the mean value theorem relates the average rate of change of a function on an interval to its instantaneous rate of change, or derivative. Let's assume that f is a function defined on a closed interval a, b, and maybe defined in some other places to let's assume that f is continuous on the whole closed interval. And that is differentiable on the interior of the interval, then the mean value theorem says that there must be some number c in the interval a, b, such that the average rate of change of f on a B is equal to the derivative of f at C. In symbols, we can write the average rate of change as f of b minus F of A over B minus A. And that has to equal f prime at C for some number C. On the graph, the average rate of change of f is the slope of the secant line. And so the mean value theorem says that there's some number c, somewhere in between a and b, so that the slope of the secant line is exactly the same as the slope of the tangent line at that x value of C. The number c is not necessarily unique. So I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can draw a graph of a function where there's more than one c value that works. So you might have drawn something maybe like this. Now, if we draw our secant line, there's two values of c, where the slope of the tangent line is equal to the slope of the secant line. In this example, we're asked to verify the mean value theorem for a particular function on a particular interval. Verify means that we need to check the hypotheses of the theorem hold. And also the the conclusion holds. The hypotheses are that f is continuous on the closed interval, one three, and that is differentiable on that interior of that interval. Both of these facts are true, because f is a polynomial. Now we need to verify that the conclusion of the mean value theorem holds. In other words, we need to find a number c in the interval one, three, such that the derivative of f at C is equal to the average rate of change of f on the interval from one to three. Now f prime of x is 6x squared minus eight. So f prime at any number c is just six c squared minus eight. We can also compute f of three just by plugging in and get 31 and f of one is negative five. Plugging in these values into our equation, we get that six c squared minus eight has to equal 31 minus negative five over To, in other words, six c squared minus eight had better equal 18, which means that six c squared needs to equal 24. So C squared has to equal four, which means that C has to equal plus or minus two. Since negative two is not in the interval from one to three, we're left with a c value of positive two. So C equals two is the number we're looking for. And at C equals to f prime is equal to 18, which is the average rate of change of f on the interval. we've verified the mean value theorem. In this example, we're told that f of one is seven, and that the derivative of f is bounded between negative three and negative two. On the interval one six, we're asked to find the biggest and smallest values that f of six could possibly be. Well, the mean value theorem gives us one way of relating the derivative of the function to its values on the endpoints of the interval. More specifically, the mean value theorem tells us that the average rate of change F of six minus f of one over six minus one is equal to the derivative f prime of c, for some C, in the interval, one, six. Since the derivative is bounded between negative three and negative two, we know that the average rate of change is bounded between negative three and negative two. We know that f of one is seven. And now we can solve this inequality for f of six. Multiply the inequality by five and add seven. And now we can see that negative eight is the smallest possible value for F six and negative three is the largest possible roles, there is an important special case of the mean value theorem. If f is a function defined on the closed interval a b, and f of x is continuous on that whole closed interval, differentiable on the interior of the interval. And if f of a is equal to f of b, then there's a number c in the interval a, b, such that f prime of c is zero. If we look at a graph of such a function that has equal values at a, and at B, we can see where its derivative has to be zero at a maximum, or a minimum in between A and B. To see why the rolls there is a special case of the mean value theorem. Think about what the mean value theorem would say about this function, it would say there is a C, such that f prime of c is equal to the average rate of change of the function. But since f of b and F of A are the same, by our assumption, this average rate of change is just zero. And so the mean value theorem, its conclusion is that there's a C, such that f prime of c equals zero, which is exactly the conclusion of rules theorem. In this video, we saw that for a function that's continuous on a closed interval, and differentiable on the interior of that interval, the average rate of change of the function is equal to the instantaneous rate of change of the function, f prime of c for some C in the interval. This video gives two proofs of the mean value theorem for integrals. the mean value theorem for integrals says that for continuous function f of x, defined on interval from a to b, there's some number c between A and B, such that f of c is equal to the average value of f. The first proof that I'm going to give uses the intermediate value theorem. Recall that the intermediate value theorem says that if we have a continuous function f defined on an interval, which I'll call x 1x, two, if we have some number l in between, f of x one and f of x two, then f has to achieve the value l somewhere between x one and x two. Keeping in mind the intermediate value theorem, let's turn our attention back to the mean value theorem for integrals. Now, it's possible that our function f of x might be constant on the interval from a to b. But if that's true, then our mean value theorem for integrals holds easily, because f AV is just equal to that constant, which is equal to f of c for any c between A and B. So let's assume that f is not constant, will it continue continuous function on a closed interval has to have a minimum value and a maximum value, which I'll call little m, and big M. Now, we know that F's average value on the interval has to be between its maximum value and its minimum value. If you don't believe this, consider the fact that all of F's values on the interval have to lie between big M and little m. And if we integrate this inequality, we get little m times b minus a is less than or equal to the integral of f is less than or equal to big M times b minus a. Notice that the first and the last integrals, were just integrating a constant. Now if I divide all three sides by b minus a, I can see that little m is less than or equal to the average value of f is less than or equal to big M as I wanted. Now, I just need to apply the intermediate value theorem with F's average as my number L and little m and big M as my values of f of x one and f of x two. The intermediate value theorem says that F average is achieved by f of c for some C in between my x one and x two. And therefore, for some C in my interval a b. And that proves the mean value theorem for integrals. Now I'm going to give a second proof for the mean value theorem for integrals. And this time, it's going to be as a corollary to the regular mean value theorem for functions. Recall that the mean value theorem for functions, says that if g of x is continuous on a closed interval, and differentiable on the interior of that interval, then there's some number c in the interval, such that the derivative of g at C is equal to the average rate of change of G, across the whole interval from a to b. Let's keep the mean value theorem for functions in mind, and turn our attention back to the mean value theorem for integrals. I'm going to define a function g of x to be the integral from a to x of f of t dt, where F is the function given to us in the statement of the mean value theorem for integrals. Notice that g of A is just the integral from a to a, which is zero, while g of B is the integral from a to b of our function. Now, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, our function g of x is continuous and differentiable on the interval a, b, and g prime of x is equal to f of x. And by the mean value theorem for functions, we know that g prime of c has to equal g of b minus g of a over b minus a, for some numbers, C and the interval a b, if we substitute in the three facts above, into our equation below, we get f of c is equal to the integral from a to b of f of t dt minus zero over b minus a, which is exactly the conclusion that we wanted to reach. This shows that the mean value theorem for integrals really is the mean value theorem for functions where our function is an integral. And this completes the second proof of the main value theorem for integrals. So now I've proved the mean value theorem for integrals in two different ways. And I've used a lot of the great theorems of calculus along the way in this video, We'll solve inequalities involving polynomials like this one, and inequalities involving rational expressions like this one. Let's start with a simple example, maybe a deceptively simple example, if you see the inequality, x squared is less than four, you might be very tempted to take the square root of both sides and get something like x is less than two as your answer. But in fact, that doesn't work. To see why it's not correct, consider the x value of negative 10. Negative 10 satisfies the inequality, x is less than two, since negative 10 is less than two. But it doesn't satisfy the inequality x squared is less than four, since negative 10 squared is 100, which is not less than four. So these two inequalities are not the same. And it doesn't work to solve a quadratic inequality just to take the square root of both sides, you might be thinking part of why this reasoning is wrong, as we've ignored the negative two option, right? If we had the equation, x squared equals four, then x equals two would just be one option, x equals negative two would be another solution. So somehow, our solution to this inequality should take this into account. In fact, a good way to solve an inequality involving x squares or higher power terms, is to solve the associated equation first. But before we even do that, I like to pull everything over to one side, so that my inequality has zero on the other side. So for our equation, I'll subtract four from both sides to get x squared minus four is less than zero. Now, I'm going to actually solve the associated equation, x squared minus four is equal to zero, I can do this by factoring 2x minus two times x plus two is equal to zero. And I'll set my factors equal to zero, and I get x equals two and x equals minus two. Now, I'm going to plot the solutions to my equation on the number line. So I write down negative two and two, those are the places where my expression x squared minus four is equal to zero. Since I want to find where x squared minus four is less than zero, I want to know whether this expression x squared minus four is positive or negative, a good way to find that out is to plug in test values. So first, I plug in a test value in this area, the number line, something less than negative two, say x equals negative three. If I plug in negative three into x squared minus four, I get negative three squared minus four, which is nine minus four, which is five, that's a positive number. So at negative three, the expression, x squared minus four is positive. And in fact, everywhere on this region of the number line, my expression is going to be positive, because it can jump from positive to negative, without going through a place where it's zero, I can figure out whether x squared minus four is positive or negative on this region, and on this region of the number line by plugging in test value similar way, evaluate the plug in between negative two and two, a nice value is x equals 00 squared minus four, that's negative four and negative number. So I know that my expression x squared minus four is negative on this whole interval. Finally, I can plug in something like x equals 10, something bigger than two, and I get 10 squared minus four. Without even computing that I can tell that that's going to be a positive number. And that's all that's important. Again, since I want x squared minus four to be less than zero, I'm looking for the places on this number line where I'm getting negatives. So I will share that in on my number line. It's in here, not including the endpoints, because the endpoints are where my expression x squared minus four is equal to zero and I want it strictly less than zero, I can write my answer. As an inequality, negative two is less than x is less than two, or an interval notation as soft bracket negative two, two soft bracket. Our next example, we can solve similarly, first, we'll move everything to one side so that our inequality is x cubed minus 5x squared minus 6x is greater than or equal to zero. Next, we'll solve the associated equation by factoring. So first, I'll write down the equation. Now I'll factor out an x. And now I'll factor the quadratic. So the solutions to my equation are x equals 0x equals six and x e equals negative one, I'll write the solutions to the equation on the number line. So that's negative one, zero, and six. That's where my expression x times x minus six times x plus one is equal to zero. But I want to find where it's greater than or equal to zero. So again, I can use test values, I can plug in, for example, x equals negative two, either to this version of expression, or to this factored version. Since I only care whether my answer is positive or negative, it's sometimes easier to use the factored version. For example, when x is negative two, this factor is negative. But this factor, x minus six is also negative when I plug in negative two for x. Finally, x plus one, when I plug in negative two for x, that's negative one, that's also negative. And a negative times a negative times a negative gives me a negative number. If I plug in something between negative one and zero, say x equals negative one half, then I'm going to get a negative for this factor, a negative for this factor, but a positive for this third factor. Negative times negative times positive gives me a positive for a test value between zero and six, let's try x equals one. Now I'll get a positive for this factor a negative for this factor, and a positive for this factor. positive times a negative times a positive gives me a negative. Finally, for a test value bigger than six, we could use a x equals 100, that's going to give me positive positive positive. So my product will be positive. Since I want values where my expression is greater than or equal to zero, I want the places where n equals zero. And the places where it's positive. So my final answer will be close bracket negative one to zero, close bracket union, close bracket six to infinity. As our final example, let's consider the rational inequality, x squared plus 6x plus nine divided by x minus one is less than or equal to zero. Although it might be tempting to clear the denominator and multiply both sides by x minus one, it's dangerous to do that, because x minus one could be a positive number. But it could also be a negative number. And when you multiply both sides by a negative number, you have to reverse the inequality. Although it's possible to solve the inequality this way, by thinking of cases where x minus one is less than zero or bigger than zero, I think it's much easier just to solve the same way as we did before. So we'll start by rewriting so that we move all terms to the left and have zero on the right, well, that's already true. So the next step would be to solve the associated equation. That is x squared plus 6x plus nine over x minus one is equal to zero. That would be where the numerators 0x squared plus 6x plus nine is equal to zero, so we're x plus three squared is zero, or x equals negative three, there's one extra step we have to do for rational expressions. And that's we need to find where the expression does not exist. That is, let's find where the denominator is zero. And that said, x equals one. I'll put all those numbers on the number line, the places where my rational expression is equal to zero, and the place where my rational expression doesn't exist, then I can start in with test values. For example, x equals minus four, zero and two work. If I plug those values into this expression here, I get a negative answer, a negative answer and a positive answer. The reason I need to conclude the values on my number line where my denominator is zero is because I can my expression can switch from negative to positive by passing through a place where my rational expression doesn't exist, as well as passing by passing flew to a place where my rational expression is equal to zero. Now I'm looking for where my original expression was less than or equal to zero. So that means I want the places on the number line where my expression is equal to zero, and also the places where it's negative. So My final answer is x is less than one, or an interval notation, negative infinity to one. In this video, we solved polynomial and rational inequalities by making a number line. And using test values to make a sign chart. The first and second derivative of a function can tell us a lot about the shape of the graph of the function. In this video, we'll see what f prime and f double prime can tell us about where the function is increasing and decreasing, is concave up and concave down and has inflection points. We say that a function is increasing. If f of x one is less than f of x two, whenever x one is less than x two. In other words, the graph of the function goes up. As x increases from left to right, we say the function f is decreasing. If f of x one is greater than f of f two, whenever x one is less than x two. In other words, the height of the function goes down as we move from left to right. In this graph, it's a little hard to say what's happening when x is near two, is it completely horizontal, or is the graph slightly increasing? If we assume it's slightly increasing, then, in this example, f of x is increasing as x ranges from zero to six, and again as x ranges from 10 to 11. The graph is decreasing for x values between six and 10. And for x values between 11 and 12, the first derivative of f can tell us where the function is increasing and decreasing. In particular, if f prime of x is greater than zero for all x on an interval, then f is increasing on this interval. This makes sense, because f prime being greater than zero means the tangent line has positive slope. Similarly, if f prime of x is less than zero for all excellent interval, then f is decreasing on this interval. That's because a negative derivative means the tangent line has a negative slope. A precise proof of these facts can be found in the textbook, or in another video, we say that a function is concave up on an interval from a to b. If informally, it looks like a bowl that could hold water on that interval. More formally, the function is concave up on that interval. If all the tangent lines for the function on that interval, lie below the graph of the function. The function is concave down on the interval from a to b. If informally, it looks like an upside down ball that would spill water on that interval. Or more formally, the function is concave down. If all the tangent lines lie above the graph of the function on an interval. In this example, f is concave up around here. And again around here. On the left piece, it looks like part of a ball that could hold water. So we can say that f is concave up on the intervals from two to four, and the interval from eight to 11. f is concave down on this piece, and this piece and this piece, so we can say that f is concave down on the interval from zero to two, from four to eight, and from 11 to 12. The concavity of a function is related to its second derivative. Here, where the function is concave up, its derivative is going from essentially zero to larger positive values. So the first road was increasing, which means the second derivative is positive. On this section of the graph, which is also concave up, the driven is going from negative values to zero. That's an increase in the first derivative. So that means the second derivative here must be positive. And in this piece, where the first term is going from zero to positive values, the first derivative is also increasing, so the second derivative is also positive. On the parts of the function that are concave down, we can see that in this example, the second derivative is negative. Here, the first derivative is going from positive towards zero, that's a decrease in the first derivative or a negative second derivative. Here the first derivative is going from positive to zero to negative, that's also a decreasing first derivative or a negative second derivative. And the same thing happens on this section here. In general, we can use the second derivative to predict the concavity of a function. The concavity test says that if the second derivative is positive for all x on an interval, then the function f is concave up on that interval. Similarly, if the second derivative is negative for all x on the interval, then the function f is concave down on that interval. One way to remember the concavity test is that a positive second derivative gives us a happy face. So the smile is supposed to be a concave up function. And a negative second derivative gives us a sad face where the smile or the frown, I guess, is a concave down function. Next, let's talk about inflection points. A function has an inflection point at x equals C, if it's continuous at C, and it changes concavity at C. In other words, f has an inflection point at x equals C. If f changes from concave up to concave down at x equals C, or it changes from concave down to concave up. In this graph, if we draw the concavity regions again, we see that F has an inflection point at x equals two, where the function changes from concave down to concave up at x equals four, where the function changes from concave up to concave down at x equals eight, and again, at x equals 11. Since concavity, has to do with the second derivative being positive or negative, inflection points happen where the second derivative changes sign from positive to negative, or from negative to positive. And that's exactly what the inflection point test says. If f double prime of x changes sign at x equals C, then f has an inflection point at x equals C. Now in order to change from positive to negative or negative positive, f double prime has to go through zero, or go through a point where it doesn't exist. But you have to be careful, just because f double prime is zero, it doesn't exist, does not guarantee that you necessarily have an inflection point, because it could be zero and still be positive on both sides or negative on both sides. For example, if f of x is x to the fourth, then f prime of x is for x cubed, and f double prime of x is 12x squared. So f double prime at zero is certainly zero. But there is no inflection point at x equals zero. In fact, the graph of f of x equals x to the fourth looks kinda like a flattened quadratic, and so there's no change in calm cavity, f is concave up on both sides of x equals zero. In this video, without the first derivative can tell us where the function is increasing and decreasing, while the second derivative can tell us where the function is concave up and concave down. And the second derivative, changing sign from positive to negative or negative or positive can tell us where we have inflection points. Since lines are much easier to work with, and more complicated functions, it can be extremely useful to approximate a function near a particular value with its tangent line. That's the central idea of this video. Let's start with an example. Suppose that F of T is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at time t measured in hours, where t equals zero represents midnight. Suppose that f of six is 60 degrees, and the derivative f prime of six is three degrees per hour. What's your best estimate for the temperature at 7am and at 8am? Please pause the video for a moment to make your estimate. The temperature at 6am is 60 degrees. So the temperature at 7am, which we're calling F of seven is approximately 60 degrees. But we can do better than this. At 6am, the temperature is rising, in fact, it's rising at a rate of three degrees per hour. If this rate of change continues, then by 7am, the temperature will have risen three degrees and reached 63 degrees. And by 8am, the temperature will have had two hours to rise from 60 degrees by a rate at a rate of three degrees per hour. So f of eight should be about 60 degrees plus the three degrees per hour times two hours or 66 degrees. These estimates use all the information, we're given both the value of the temperature at six, and its rate of change. Let's see what these estimates mean graphically, in terms of the tangent line. I'll draw a rough graph of temperature over time. And I'll also draw in the tangent line at time six. At time six, the height of the function and the tangent line is equal to 60 degrees. The tangent line has slope three degrees per hour. So that's a rise of a run of three, which means that seven o'clock, which is one hour, after six o'clock, the tangent line has risen by three degrees. And at eight o'clock, the tangent line has risen by another three degrees. So at seven o'clock, our tangent line has had 63 degrees, and at eight o'clock, our tangent line has height 66 degrees. When making these estimates, here, we were actually using the tangent line to approximate our function. Our actual temperature function may be rising more steeply than the tangent line, or it possibly could be rising less steeply, like in this picture. But either way, the tangent line is a good approximation for our function. When time is near six o'clock. The idea of approximating a function with its tangent line is a very important idea that works for any differentiable function. Let f of x be any differentiable function and let A be an arbitrary x value. Let's suppose we know the value of f at a, we'll call it F of A. And let's say we want to find the value of f, add an x value near a, let's call it a plus delta x where delta x means a small number. If we can't compute f of a plus delta x directly, we can try to approximate it using the tangent line. We know that the tangent line has a slope given by f prime of a. And so when we go over by a run of delta x, the tangent line goes up by a rise of f prime of A times delta x. So the height of the tangent line is going to be f of a plus f prime of A times delta x. The linear approximation principle says that we can approximate our function with our tangent line. In other words, f of a plus delta x is approximately equal to f of a plus f prime of a delta x. Remember that delta x is supposed to be a small number, because if you get too far away from a, your tangent lines no longer going to be a good approximation of your function. But how small is small enough is sort of a judgment call. Sometimes the approximation principle is written with different symbols, if we let x equal a plus delta x, so x is a number close to a, then delta x is x minus a. And we can rewrite the approximation principle, as f of x is approximately f of a plus f prime of A times x minus a. The quantity on the right side here is sometimes referred to as l of x, and called the linearization of f at A. That is the linearization of f of a is l of x, which is equal to f of a plus f prime of A times x minus a. So the approximation principle can also be written as f of x is approximately equal to l of x. Let's look a little more closely at this linearization equation and what it has to do with the tangent line. Suppose we were going to try to write down the equation of the tangent line at x equals a, well, the equation for any line can be given in point slope form as y minus y naught equals the slope times x minus x naught. Since we're looking for the tangent line that goes through the point A f of a, we can set x naught equal to a and y naught equal to f of a. Also, the slope of the tangent line is just f prime of a. So we can rewrite this as y minus F of A equals f prime of A times x minus a solving for y, we get y equals f of a plus f prime of A times x minus a. So this equation for the tangent line is really just the equation that we have for the linearization. But linearization is really just a fancy word for the tangent line. There's a lot of notation and definitions on this page. But there's only one important principle that you need to remember. And that's the idea that you can approximate a function with its tangent line. If you can keep that idea and this picture in mind, then it's easy to come up with this approximation principle. And its alternative forms. Let's use the approximation principle in an example, the approximation principle tells us that f of a plus delta x is approximately equal to f of a plus f prime of A times delta x, we need to figure out what f should be what a should be, and what delta x should be. Since we're trying to figure out the square root of 59, it makes sense to make our function the square root function. For a, we'd like to pick something that is easy to compute f of a, well, what's the number close to 59, that is easy to compute the square root of 64 springs to mind. So let's set a equal to 64. Since we're trying to compute the square root of 59, we want a plus delta x to be 59. In other words, 64 plus delta x is 59. And so delta x should be negative five, it's fine to have a negative number for delta x. Now plugging into our approximation formula, we have f of 59 is approximately equal to f of 64, plus f prime of 64 times negative five. Since f of x is the square root of x, or in other words, x to the one half power, f prime of x is going to be one half x to the minus one half power, or one over two times the square root of x. So f prime of 64 is one over two times the square root of 64, which is 1/16. I can rewrite my red equation to say the square root of 59 is approximately the square root of 64 plus 1/16 times negative five, which is eight minus five sixteenths, or 7.6875. using a calculator, I can get a more exact value of the square to 59. my calculator says 7.68114575, up to eight decimal places. Let me draw the picture that goes along with this approximation. We have the square root function, and at x equals 64, we're looking at the tangent line. Our delta x here is a negative five, and gets us down to 59. So we're using the value of our tangent line right here to approximate our actual square root function right here. As you can see from the picture, it looks like the tangent line value should be slightly bigger than the actual value. And in fact, that's what we get. Then next example is very similar. We call it the linearization of a function is just the equation for its tangent line. Namely, the linearization at a is f of a plus f prime of A times x minus a. And the approximation principle says that f of x, the function is approximately equal to its linearization. Its tangent line, at least when x is near a. This is basically the same formula that we use in the last problem, we're just calling our value x this time instead of a plus delta x. Since we're trying to estimate sine of A value, it makes sense to let our function be sine of x. For a, we want to pick a number that's close to 33 degrees, for which it's easy to calculate sine of that number. Well, sine of 30 degrees is easy to calculate. So let's make a equal to 30 degrees, but let's put it in radians and call it pi over six. in calculus, we pretty much always want to use radians for sine and cosine especially when taking derivatives. Since the derivative formula, D sine x dx equals cosine of x only works when x is in radians, our x needs to be 33 degrees, since that's the value, we want to estimate the sine of, we need to multiply by pi over 180 degrees to convert it to radians. So that becomes 11 pi over 60 radians. Let's plug in for F and a first to get the linearization. And then we'll plug in for x next. So the linearization of our function is going to be sine of pi over six, plus the derivative of sine at pi over six times x minus pi over six. That is l of x is one half, since sine of pi over six is one half, plus cosine of pi over six times x minus pi over six, cosine of pi over six is the square root of three over two. So this is our equation for the tangent line, or the linearization of sine of x at pi over six. Now we know that sine of x is approximately equal to as linearisation, as long as x is near pi over six. So in particular, sine of our 33 degrees in radians, which is 11 pi over 60 is approximately equal to one half plus a square root of three over two times 11 pi over 60 minus pi over six. That simplifies to one half plus the square root of three over two times pi over 60. And now I'm going to cheat a little bit and use my calculator to get a decimal value for this of about 0.5453. Now if I use my calculator to find sine of 11 pi over 60, directly, remember, that's the same thing as sine of 33 degrees. my calculator tells me it is 0.5446, approximately. So you can see our approximation using the linearization is very close to the calculators, more accurate value. Notice that in this example, the approximate value based on the linearization is slightly higher than the actual value. And you can see why from a graph of sine. The tangent line at pi over six lies slightly above the graph of sine x. Therefore, the approximate value based on the linearization will be slightly bigger than the actual value of sine of 33 degrees. In this video, we use several formulas to express one key idea. The main formulas were the approximation principle, the linear approximation, and the linearization. The key idea is that a differentiable function can be approximated near a value x equals A by the tangent line at x equals a. The differential is a new vocabulary word wrapped around the familiar concept of approximating a function with its tangent line. This figure should look familiar from the previous video on linear approximation is the same picture. Suppose we have a differentiable function, f of x, and we know the value of f at some x value a. That is, we know the value of f evey, but we don't know the value of f at some nearby x value a plus delta x. That is we don't know f of a plus delta x. So we draw the tangent line to f of x at x equals a. And we use the tangent line at a plus delta x as an approximation for the function at a plus delta x. Since the tangent line has slope of f prime of a, the rise of a run is f prime of a. So if this run here is delta x, this rise has to be f prime of A times delta x. So the height of the tangent line here at a plus delta x is going to be f of a plus f prime of A times delta x. That's just the height here plus the extra height here. And since we're using that height to approximate In our function, we say that f of a plus delta x is approximately equal to f of a plus f prime of A times delta x equivalently. If I subtract F of A from both sides, I get f of a plus delta x minus f of a is approximately equal to f prime of A times delta x. This equation is just the approximation principle that we've seen before. And this is a very slight alteration of it. So there's nothing new yet. But now I'm going to wrap some new notation around this familiar concept. The differential dx is another way of writing delta x, you can think of it as a small change in the value of x. The differential df is defined as f prime of x dx, or equivalently f prime of x delta x. Sometimes this is written as d y instead, but d y just means the same thing here as df. Sometimes it's handy to specify the differential add a particular value of x, like a value of x equals a, and this is written df equals f prime of a dx, or f prime of a delta x. Notice that the value of a is not apparent when you just write down d f, or d y. Finally, the change in f, which is written delta f, is defined as f of x plus delta x minus f of x for some value of x, for example, f of a plus delta x minus f of a, this can also be written as the change in y. Using these new definitions, we can now rewrite our approximation principle to say, delta f is approximately equal to d f, the change in the function is approximately equal to the differential course this could also be written as the change in Y is approximately equal to d y. In the picture, we can now write d x for the run, and D, F, for the rise of the tangent line. Pause the video and take a moment to find delta f in this picture, though delta f is f of a plus delta x minus f of a, so that's this height here. I'll write that as delta f, or delta y. So the approximation principle, written in differential notation, is just saying that the rise of the function, delta f is approximated by the rise in the tangent line df. Let's use the differential and an example. For the function f of x equal to x times ln x. Let's first find the differential df. We know that df is equal to f prime of x dx. And f prime of x by the product rule is equal to x times the derivative of ln x, which is one over x plus the derivative of x, which is one times ln x. So in other words, one plus ln x. Therefore, df is equal to one plus ln x times dx. When x equals two, and delta x equals negative point three, well delta x is the same thing as dx, we can just plug in those values and get df is one plus ln of two times negative 0.3. as a decimal, that's approximately negative 0.5079. Now delta f is defined as f of x plus delta x minus f of x. So for our function, that's x plus delta x times ln of x plus delta x minus x ln x. Plugging in the given values for x and delta x, we get delta f is two minus 0.3 times ln of two minus 0.3 minus two ln two, which according to my calculator is negative zero. Point 4842. And we see that the change in the function between two and two minus point three is closely approximated by the change in the tangent line. As expected. The differential is often used to estimate error, as in this example, suppose that the radius of a sphere is measured as eight centimeters with a possible error of point five centimeters. So the sphere that we measure looks something like this, but the actual sphere might be slightly bigger, or slightly smaller, we want to use the differential to estimate the resulting error in computing the volume of the sphere. Well, the volume of a sphere is given by four thirds pi r cubed, where r is the radius. If our radius changes by point five centimeters, our volume will change by substantially more. And that change in volume is the error the resulting error in measuring volume. But instead of computing delta V directly, we're asked to approximate it using the differential. So we're going to use the fact that delta V is approximately equal to dv, which is easier to compute. By definition, dv is equal to the derivative of our function, I'll just call that v prime as a function of r times Dr. Now, v prime of r is equal to four pi r squared, just by taking the derivative. And here, we're interested in an R value of eight, and a value of Dr. Same as delta r of 0.5 centimeters. So dv is going to be four pi r squared Dr. And when I plug in R and D R, I get four pi times eight squared times 0.5, which is 128 pi, or as a decimal 402.1 centimeters. That's our error estimate, which seems quite a bit bigger than our original error of point five in measuring the radius. Now, the relative error of a function is its error over the original value of the function. So in our case, it's the change in volume over the actual volume. Since we're using the differential instead, we'll compute the relative error as dv over V. Now, the volume when r is eight centimeters, is four thirds times pi times eight cubed. And dv, we already saw was four pi times eight squared times 0.5. So dv divided by V is given by this ratio, which simplifies to 0.1875. So an 18.75% relative there. To me, the relative error gives a better sense for the error than the absolute error estimate above. This video introduced the idea of the differential, we said that we could think of dx as just being another way of writing delta x, but df represents the rise in the tangent line, and is equal to f prime of x times dx. Whereas delta f is the rise in the actual function F. And that's f of x plus delta x minus f of x. On the picture, dx is the run, df is the rise in the tangent line. And delta f is the rise in the actual function. In the language of differentials, we can restate the approximation principle to say that the change in f can be approximated by the differential. In the past, we've encountered limits, like the limit as x goes to two of x minus two over x squared minus four. We can't evaluate this limit just by plugging in two for x, because x minus two goes to zero, and x squared minus four goes to zero as x goes to two. This is known as a zero over zero indeterminate form. It's called indeterminate because we can't tell what the limit is going to be just by the fact that the numerator goes to zero and the denominator goes to zero. It depends on how fast the numerator and the denominator are going to zero compared to each other. And the final limit of the quotient could be any number at all, or it could be infinity or it could not even exist. In the past, we've been able to evaluate some limits in zero over zero indeterminate form by using algebraic tricks to rewrite the quotients. In this video, we'll introduce lopi talls rule, which is a very powerful technique for evaluating limits and indeterminate forms. A limited of the form the limit as x goes to a of f of x over g of x is called a zero over zero indeterminate form, if the limit as x goes to a of f of x is equal to zero, and the limit as x goes to a of g of x is equal to zero. A limit and this form is called an infinity over infinity and determinant form. If the limit as x goes to a of f of x is equal to infinity or minus infinity. And the limit as x goes to a of g of x is equal to infinity or minus infinity. We saw an example of a zero over zero indeterminate form in the introductory slide. One example of a infinity over infinity and determinant form is the limit as x goes to infinity of 3x squared minus 2x plus seven divided by negative 2x squared plus 16. Notice that as x goes to infinity, the numerator goes to infinity while the denominator goes to negative infinity. In these definitions of indeterminate form, it's possible for a to be negative infinity or infinity, like it is in this example, but it doesn't have to be loopy. talls rule can be applied when f and g are differentiable functions. And the derivative of g is nonzero in some open interval around a except possibly in a under these conditions, if the limit as x goes to a of f of x over g of x is zero over zero or infinity over infinity indeterminant form than the limit as x goes to a of f of x over g of x is the same thing as the limit as x goes to a of f prime of x over g prime of x, provided that the second limit exists, or as plus or minus infinity. Let's look at loopy tiles rule in action. In this example, as x goes to infinity, the numerator x goes to infinity and the denominator three to the x also goes to infinity. So we have an infinity over infinity indeterminate form. So let's try applying lopi tiles rule, our original limit should equal the limit as x goes to infinity of the derivative of the numerator, which is one divided by the derivative of the denominator, which is ln of three times three to the x, provided that the second limit exists or as infinity or negative infinity. In the second limit, the numerators just fixed at one. And the nominator goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. Therefore, the second limit is just zero. And so the original limit evaluates to zero as well. In this example, we have a zero over zero indeterminate form, because as x goes to zero, sine of x and x, both go to zero in the numerator, and sine of x cubed goes to zero in the denominator. So using low Patel's rule, I'll try to evaluate instead, the limit I get by taking the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator, the derivative of sine x minus x is cosine of x minus one, and the derivative of sine x cubed is three times sine x squared times cosine x using the chain rule. Now let me try to evaluate the limit again, as x goes to zero, cosine of x goes to one. So the numerator here goes to zero. As x goes to zero, sine of x goes to zero and cosine of x goes to one, so the denominator also goes to zero. So I still have a zero over zero indeterminate form. And I might as well try applying loopy toss rule again. But before I do, I want to point out that cosine of x is going to one. So the cosine of x here really isn't affecting my limit. And in fact, I could rewrite my limit of a product as a product of limits where the second limit is just one and can be ignored from here on out. Now apply lopatok rule on this first limit, which is a little bit easier to take the derivatives and so the derivative of the top is minus sine x. And the derivative of the bottom is six times sine x times cosine x. Now let's try to evaluate again, as x goes to zero, our numerator is going to zero, and our denominator is also going to zero. But hang on, we don't have to apply lobby towels rule again, because we can actually just simplify our expression, the sine x on the top cancels with the sine x on the bottom. And we can just rewrite our limit as the limit of negative one over six cosine of x, which evaluates easily to negative one, six. In this example, I want to emphasize that it's a good idea to simplify after each application of lopi talls rule. If you don't simplify, like we did here, then you might be tempted to apply loopy towels rule and additional time when you don't need to, which might make the problem more complicated. Instead of simpler to solve this video, we were able to evaluate zero over zero and infinity over infinity indeterminate forms by replacing the limit of f of x over g of x with the limit of f prime of x over g prime of x, provided that second limit exists. This trick is known as lopi tels rule. We've seen that lopatok rule can be used to evaluate limits of the form zero over zero, or infinity over infinity. In this video, we'll continue to use lopi towels rule to evaluate additional indeterminate forms, like zero times infinity, infinity to the 00 to the zero, and one to the infinity. In this example, we want to evaluate the limit of a product. Notice that as x goes to zero from the positive side, sine x goes to zero, and ln x goes to negative infinity. Remember the graph of y equals ln x. So this is actually a zero times infinity indeterminate form. Even though the second factor is going to negative infinity, we still call it a zero times infinity and indeterminate form, you can think of the Infinity here as standing for either positive or negative infinity. It it's indeterminant. Because as x goes to zero, the sine x factor is pulling the product towards zero, while the ln x factor is pulling the product towards large negative numbers. And it's hard to predict what the limit of the product will actually be. But the great thing is, I can actually rewrite this product to look like an infinity over infinity and determinant form, or a zero over zero and determinant form. Instead of sine x times ln x, I can rewrite the limit as ln x divided by one over sine x. Now as x goes to zero, my numerator is going to negative infinity. And since sine x is going to zero through positive numbers, my denominator one over sine x is going to positive infinity. So I have an infinity over infinity indeterminate form. Now, I could instead choose to leave the sine x in the numerator, and instead, put a one over ln x in the denominator. If I do this, then as x goes to zero through positive numbers, sine x goes to zero. And since ln x goes to negative infinity, one over ln x goes to zero. And so I have a zero over zero indeterminate form. Sometimes it can be difficult to decide which of these two ways to rewrite a product as a quotient. One rule of thumb is to take the version that makes it easier to take the derivative of the numerator and denominator. Another trick is just to try one of the ways and if you get stuck, go back and try the other. I'm going to use the first method of rewriting it because I recognize that one over sine x can be written as cosecant of x. And I know how to take the derivative of cosecant x. Using low Beatles rule on this infinity over infinity and determinant form, I can rewrite my limit as the limit of what I get when I take the derivative of the numerator, that's whenever x divided by the derivative of the denominator, that's negative cosecant x cotangent x. As always, I want to simplify my expression before going any further. I can rewrite my trig functions in the denominator in terms of sine and cosine. cosecant x is one over sine x cotangent x is cosine of x over sine of x. Now flipping and multiplying, I get the limit as x goes to zero plus of one over x times sine squared of x over negative cosine of x. In other words, the limit of negative sine squared x over x cosine x, we know that cosine of x goes to one as x goes to zero. So I can rewrite this as the limit of negative sine squared x over x times the limit of something that goes to one. So I once again have a zero over zero indeterminate form. And I can apply lopatok rule yet again, taking the derivative of the top, I get negative two, sine x, cosine of x. And the job of the bottom is just one. Now I'm in a good position just to evaluate the limit by plugging in zero for x in the numerator, I get negative two times zero times one, the denominator is just one, so my final limit is zero. In this limit, we have a battle of forces. As x is going to infinity, one over x is going to zero. So one plus one over x is going to one, but the exponent x is going to infinity, it's hard to tell what's going to happen here. If we had one, to any finite number, that would be one. But anything slightly bigger than one, as we raise it to a bigger and bigger powers, we would expect to get infinity. So our limit has an independent permanent form, it's hard to tell whether the answer is going to be one infinity, or maybe something in between. Whenever I see an expression with a variable in the base, and a variable in the exponent, I'm tempted to use logarithms. If we set y equal to one plus one over x to the x, then if I take the natural log of both sides, I can use my log roles to rewrite that by multiplying by x in the front. Now, if I wanted to take the limit as x goes to infinity of ln y, that would be the limit of this product, x times ln one plus one over x. As x goes to infinity, the first factor x goes to infinity. One plus one over x goes to just one and ln one is going to zero. So we have a infinity times zero indeterminate form, which we can try to rewrite as an infinity over infinity, or a zero over zero indeterminate form. Let's rewrite this as the limit of ln one plus one over x divided by one over x. This is indeed a zero over zero in determinant form. So we can use lobi tiles rule and take the derivative of the top and the bottom, the derivative of the top is one over one plus one over x times the derivative of the inside, which would be negative one over x squared. And the derivative on the bottom, the derivative of one over x is negative one over x squared, we can actually cancel out these two factors, and rewrite our limit as the limit as x goes to infinity of one over one plus one over x, which is just equal to one, since one over x is going to zero. So we found that the limit of ln y is equal to one, but we're really interested in finding the limit of y, which we can think of as e to the ln y. Since ln y is going to one, e to the ln y must be going to e to the one. In other words, E. So we found that our original limit is equal to E. And in fact, you may recognize that this limit is one of the ways of defining IE. In the previous example, we had a one to the internet Today in determinant form, and we took logs and use log roles to write that as an infinity times zero and determinant form. Well, the same thing can be done if we have an infinity to the zero indeterminate form, or a zero to the zero indeterminate form. So one to the infinity, infinity to the zero, and zero to the zero, are all indeterminate forms that can be handled using lobi toss rule. In this video, we saw that a zero times infinity indeterminate form could be converted to a zero over zero, or infinity over infinity indeterminate form by rewriting f of x times g of x as f of x divided by one over g of x, or as g of x divided by one over f of x. We also saw how to use lopi talls rule on these three sorts of indeterminate forms by taking the ln of y, where y is our f of x to the g of x that we want to take the limit of. This video is about Newton's method for finding the zeros of a function, f of x. In other words, the values of x that make f of x equal to zero. The zeros of a function can also be thought of as the x intercepts of its graph. Suppose we want to find a solution to the equation either the x equals 4x. This equation cannot be solved using standard algebraic methods. For example, taking the ln of both sides doesn't really help because we still get x equals ln of 4x, which is just as hard to solve. Instead, we can look for approximate solutions. Looking at the graph of y equals e to the x and y equals 4x, we see there should be two solutions, one at approximately x equals little more than two and the other around x equals maybe point three or point four. Newton's method will allow us to make much more accurate approximations to the solution of this equation, then we can do by just glancing at the graph. To use Newton's method, instead of looking at the equation, e to the x equals 4x. We'll look at the equation E to the X minus 4x equals zero. And in fact, we'll define the function f of x to be e to the x minus 4x. And look for zeros of that function. After all, finding a zero of this function is the same as finding a solution to our original equation. So now we're trying to solve the equivalent problem of finding the zero of the function f of x equals e to the x minus 4x. That's the function that's drawn below. I'm going to focus on this zero, the one near to, and I'm just going to make an initial guess anything reasonably close to the actual zero should do. So I'll just put an initial guess right here, and I'll call it x one. Now x one is not actually zero of my function, and I'll write the point on the graph above it as x one, f of x one. To get a better estimate for the zero of my function, I'm going to make use of the tangent line to my function that goes through this point. So the second step will be to find this tangent line. Since the tangent line is a reasonably good approximation to the function, the point where the tangent line crosses the x axis should be closer to the point where the function itself crosses the x axis, which is the point I'm looking for. So the third step will be to find the x intercept for the tangent line. I'll call this x intercept, x two. Now I'm just going to repeat this process. I'll use x two as my next guess. I'll follow it up to the function where I have the point x to f of x two, and then I'll draw a new tangent line and get a new intercept. I can repeat this process as often as I need to, to get a sufficiently accurate approximation to my actual zero of my function. Now that I've described the process graphically, let's find some equations that go along with this picture. If I start with the initial guess, of x one, then the tangent line through x one, f of x one is given by the x Bayesian y equals f of x one plus f prime of x one times x minus x one. You might remember this equation from a section on linearization. And it's really just comes from the formula y minus y one equals m x minus x one that holds for any line, where m here is the derivative at x one, and y one is f of x one. plugging into that equation, we have y minus f of x one equals f prime of x one times x minus x one, which simplifies to y equals f of x one plus f prime of x one times x minus x one. So that's where this linearization equation comes from. It's just the equation of the tangent line. Now, if we want to find the x intercept of the tangent line, we just said the tangent line equation equal to zeros, we have zero equals f of x one plus f prime of x one times x minus x one, and we solve for x. so this can subtract f of x one from each side, divided by f prime of x one and solve for x. We're calling this new x intercept x two. So x two is x one minus f of x one over f prime of x one. Now we have our second guess, x two, and we can again find the tangent line through x two, f of x two, that tangent line will be given by the same sort of equation. And if we then find the x intercept, the same algebraic steps, get us to the analogous equation x three equals x two minus f of x two over f prime of x two. And more generally, as we repeat this process over and over again, our n plus one guess is going to be given by x n plus one equals x n minus f of x n over f prime of x n. That's the J equation at the core of Newton's method. Now that we've got the theory down, let's grind through the problem at hand with some numbers. Our function has the equation f of x equals e to the x minus 4x. So f prime of x is e to the x minus four. So from Newton's methods equation, we have in general, X sub n plus one is X sub n minus e to the x sub n minus four times X sub n over e to the x sub n minus four. Let's start with for example, x sub one equals three, then x sub two is going to be three minus e cubed minus four times three over e cubed minus four. plugging this into a calculator, I get x sub two equals 2.4973, and so on. Now to cube compute x sub three, I have to take this whole number and plug that in to my formula. I've written it out as just 2.49. But for accuracy, when I actually computed my calculator, I'll use the entire number. my calculator gives me this answer for x of three and continue in this process, I can get x of 4x 5x sub six. If I compute one more, x of seven, I noticed that I have no change to my value in the number of digits that the calculator spits out. So at this point, my Newton's methods iterations have converged. And I have an answer that's accurate to about eight decimal places. I found one zero for my function. And if I wanted to find the second zero, the one over here, I would just need to start with an initial value that's close to this x coordinate, perhaps an initial value of zero might be good. In this video, we developed an algorithm for getting increasingly accurate approximations to the zero of a function. The central equation that we used was this one which tells us how to get from one approximation, X sub n to the next 1x sub n plus one. When we go from a function, say 3x plus sine x to its derivative, in this case, three plus cosine x, that's called differentiating, or finding a derivative. Anti differentiating, or finding an antiderivative, takes us the other direction, from a derivative to a function that has that as its derivative. For example, if g prime of x is 3x squared, that's the derivative. What could g of x the original function be? Well, g of x could be x cubed, since the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared. Or it could also be g of x equals x cubed plus seven, for example, or g of x equals x cubed plus any constant, where I write a general constant with a capital C. That's because the derivative of a constant zero, so the derivative of x cubed plus a constant is just going to be 3x squared, no matter what the constant is. A function capital F of X is called an antiderivative of lowercase F of X on an interval a, b, if the derivative, capital F prime of X is equal to lowercase F of X on that interval a b. In other words, we can think of little f as being the derivative of the function capital F. In the above example, x cubed is an antiderivative of 3x squared. And in fact, x cubed plus C for any constant C is also an antiderivative of 3x squared. When we add on a general constancy, that's sometimes referred to as a general antiderivative, we found a general family of anti derivatives for the function 3x squared. But could there be other anti derivatives, other functions whose derivative is 3x squared. In fact, there are no others. And one way to think about this intuitively, is if you have two functions with the same derivative, it's like having two runners in a race that always speed up and slow down at exactly the same times. If one of those runners starts ahead of the other, then the distance between them will always stay exactly the same. That's the vertical distance drawn here on the graph. And that's the constant C, that separates one antiderivative y equals x cubed from another y equals x cubed plus C. And in general, if capital F of X is an antiderivative for a little f of x, then all other anti derivatives can be written in the form capital F of x plus C for some constancy. A more rigorous justification of this fact, can be proved using the mean value theorem, as I'll do in a separate video. If you know the derivatives for some standard functions, then it's pretty easy to get some anti derivatives. For example, the antiderivative of one is x. Since the derivative of x is one, if we want to make that a general antiderivative, we can add a constant C, the antiderivative of x is x squared over two because when I take the derivative of x squared over two, the two that I pulled down and multiply cancels with the two in the denominator, leaving me x. Again, I can make this a more general antiderivative by adding a constant C. More generally, the antiderivative of x to the n for any and that's not equal to negative one is given by x to the n plus one divided by n plus one plus a constant C. I can check this by taking the derivative of x to the n plus one over n plus one. The n here is just a constant. So using the power rule, I get n plus one times x to the n divided by n plus one that yields x to the n, which is what I want it. We can think of this rule as the power rule for anti differentiating since it's closely related to the power rule for differentiating. Now, this rule doesn't apply when n equals negative one. Notice that we'd be dividing by zero if n were negative one but we can handle the case when n equals negative one separately, since x to the negative one is one of our x, we recognize that the antiderivative of one of our x is just ln of the absolute value of x plus C. Since the derivative of ln of the absolute value of x is one over x, please pause the video and see how many more anti derivatives you can fill in in this table. You should get all of these formulas based on the analogous formulas for differentiating, notice that the antiderivative of sine x is negative cosine x not cosine x, because the derivative of cosine x is negative sine x. If I have a constant times x to the n, I'm going to call the constant a instead of C, since I've already got some C's floating around. If I want the antiderivative of A times x to the n, that's just going to be a times the antiderivative of x to the n, which is x to the n plus one over n plus one plus a constant say that's because when I take the derivative of a constant times a function, I can just pull the constant out. More generally, the antiderivative of a constant A times any function, little f of x is just going to equal A times the antiderivative of little f of x, which I'll denote with capital F of X, plus a constant C. The antiderivative of f of x plus g of x is capital F of X, plus capital G of x plus c, where capital F and capital G are the antiderivative of lowercase F and lowercase J. This is because the derivative of a sum is equal to the sum of the derivatives. Let's use this information to compute the antiderivative for f of x equals five over one plus x squared minus one over two times the square root of x. First, I'm going to rewrite f of x as five times one over one plus x squared minus one half times x to the minus one half. I know that the antiderivative of one over one plus x squared is arctangent of x. And by the power rule for anti differentiating the antiderivative of x to the minus one half, I get by raising the exponent by one, negative one half plus one is positive one half, and then dividing by the new exponent by my constant multiplication rules, I can just multiply by my constants. And that's my antiderivative capital F of X, I've have to remember the plus C for the general antiderivative, I can simplify a little bit by canceling these one halves. And I get a final answer of five times arc tan of x minus a squared of x plus C. In this video, we introduced anti derivatives and build a table of anti derivatives based on our knowledge of derivatives. In this video, we'll solve problems where we're given an equation for the derivative of the function. And we're given an initial condition, something like f of one equals seven. And we have to find the function f of x. In this first example, suppose g prime of x is e to the x minus three times sine x. and g of two pi is five, we need to find g of x. Well, g of x is an antiderivative of e to the x minus three sine x. So g of x is of the form e to the x plus three cosine of x plus a constant C. That's because the derivative of e to the x is e to the x, the derivative of cosine x is minus sine x, and the derivative of a constant is just zero. Now I need to find the value of the constant C that makes this initial condition come true. If I plug in two pi for x, I get e to the two pi plus three times cosine of two pi plus C, and that needs to equal five. Since cosine of two pi is one, I have that e to the two pi plus three plus c equals five. And so C is equal to two minus e to the two pi. So my function g of x is equal to either the x plus three cosine x Plus two minus e to the two pi. In this example, we're given the second derivative of f. And we're given two initial conditions, f of one is zero, and f of zero is two. To start, I'm going to rewrite f double prime of x in a more manageable form. by distributing, I get the square root of x times x minus the square root of x over x. and rewriting with exponents, we get x to the three halves minus x to the minus one half. Next, I'm going to find f prime of x, which is the antiderivative of f double prime of x. So f prime of x, using the power rule for anti derivatives, I raised the exponent of three halves by one to get five halves, and then divide by the new exponent five halves. Similarly, I raised negative one half by one to get one half and divide by the new exponent one half. And I'll add on a constant see, let me simplify a little here, instead of dividing by five halves, multiply by two fifths, and instead of dividing by one half, multiply by two. Now I've got an expression for f prime of x, but I need an expression for f of x, which is the antiderivative of f prime, and so all anti differentiate again. So now I have two fifths times x to the seven halves over seven halves minus two times x to the three halves over three halves, the antiderivative of a constant C is C times x, and then I'll add on a new constant D. After simplifying a bit, I'm ready to use my initial conditions, in order to solve for my constant C and D. When I plug in zero for x, all my x terms vanish, I'm just left with D, so d has to equal two. So I can rewrite my function, setting D equal to two. And now my second condition says that f of one equals zero. So plugging in one for x, I get 430 fifths minus four thirds plus c plus two, and that has to equal zero, which means that c is negative two, minus 430 fifths, plus four thirds, which simplifies to minus 80 to 100, and fifths. If we plug that in for C, we get a final answer for f of x. And that finishes the problem. In this final example, we're not given any equations, so we have to make them up ourself, we're told that we're standing at the edge of a cliff, at height 30 meters, with throw a tomato up in the air at an initial velocity of 20 meters per second. The tomato then falls down to the ground due to gravity. And we want to find how long that takes and what its velocity is at impact. We know that the acceleration due to gravity is negative 9.8 meters per second squared. If we're working in metric units. The similar figure if we're working in units of feet, is negative 32 feet per second squared. The negative sign is because gravity is pulling objects down towards the ground in the negative direction. We're also given the initial condition, that velocity at time zero is 20 meters per second. That's a positive velocity because we're throwing the tomato up. And we're told that the initial position s of zero is 30 meters. So let's start with the equation that acceleration is negative 9.8. In other words, S double prime of t is negative 9.8. Therefore, S prime of t is negative 9.8 t plus a constant c one. And from my initial condition about velocity, I know that s prime of zero is 20. So in other words, S prime of zero is negative 9.8 times zero plus c one that has to equal 20. Which means that c one is equal to 20. Substituting in 20 for C one, I can rewrite s prime of t Now I can find f of t, the antiderivative of S prime. And that's going to be negative 9.8 times t squared over two plus 20 t plus a second constant C two. Using my second initial condition, f of zero equals 30. I can plug in zero for t, and get an expression that equals 30. Since all the terms drop out, besides the C two, that tells me that C two is 30. And so I can find my equation position by substituting 34 c two. Now I want to find out how long it takes the tomato to hit the ground. So that's going to be the time when s of t equals zero. Setting zero equal to my expression for S of t, I can use the quadratic formula to solve for t, and I get t equals approximately negative 1.17, or 5.25. The negative time doesn't make sense for the problem. So I'm left with a time of impact of 5.25 seconds. Now to find the velocity of the impact, I need to plug that time into my velocity equation. In other words, my equation for S prime. So s prime of 5.25, is 9.8 times 5.25, plus 20, which simplifies to negative 31.45 meters per second, probably enough to squash the tomato. And that's all for this video on finding anti derivatives using initial conditions. In this video, I'll use the mean value theorem to show that the antiderivative zero has to be a constant. And then any two anti derivatives of the same function have to differ by a constant. In a previous video, I stated the fact that if f of x is one antiderivative of a function, little f of x, than any other antiderivative of that same function can be written in the form capital F of x plus C for some constant C. In other words, any two antiderivative of the same function have to differ by a constant. To prove this fact, let's first note that if the derivative of a function, g prime of x is equal to zero on an interval than the original function, g of x must equal C for some constant C. This statement follows from the mean value theorem, because the mean value theorem tells us that for any x one and x two in our interval, the average rate of change between x one and x two is equal to the derivative at some number x three in between x one and x two. But by assumption, g prime is zero everywhere on the interval, so g prime of x three must be equal to zero. This means that our numerator, g of x want to minus g of x one has to equal zero. In other words, g of x two is equal to g of x one, but that's true for any x one and x two. So all the values of G are equal, and G must be a constant. The second observation that I want to make is that if G one and G two are two functions, which have the same derivative, then g one of x must equal g two of x plus C for some constant C. This statement follows from the previous statement, because if G one prime of x is equal to g two prime of x, then g one prime of x minus g two prime of x must equal zero. But that means if I look at the function g one of x minus g two of x, and take its derivative, that has to equal zero, since the derivative The difference is the difference of the derivatives. Now our previous statement tells us that if the derivative of a function is zero, the function must be a constant, and therefore, g one of x minus g two of x equals C for some constant C, which means that g one of x is equal to g two of x plus C, which is what we wanted to prove. So we've proved that any two functions with the same derivative have to differ by a constant or in other words, If capital F of X is one antiderivative of a function than any other antiderivative must be of the form capital F of x plus C. This concludes the proof that any two anti derivatives of a particular function must differ by a constant. This video will review summation notation, that is, the sigma notation used to write a song. In this expression, using the greek capital letter sigma, the letter I is called the index. The number one is called the lower limit of summation, or the starting index. And the number five is called the upper limit of summation, or the ending index, we evaluate this expression by summing up to the I, for all values of i starting from one and ending at five and stepping through the integers. In other words, we start with i equals one and take two to the one. And then we add to it two to the two, two to the Three, two to the four, and two to the five. If we do the arithmetic, this comes out to 62. In the second expression, our index is J, and we start with J equals three and go up to J equals seven, once again, stepping through integer values. So we have to add up 1/3 plus 1/4, plus 1/5, plus one, six, and then our last term is one seven. This sum is equal to 153, over 140. When we're given a psalm like this one, it can be handy to write it in sigma notation, because it's more compact. But to do so, we have to look for the pattern between the terms. In this case, the terms all differ by three. So I can think of nine as being six plus three, and 12, as being six plus twice, three, and 15 as being six plus three times three, and so on. In fact, we can even think of six itself as being six plus zero times three to fit this pattern. Now we can write the sum as sigma of six plus i times three, where I ranges from zero to four. Here, we're thinking of six plus three as six plus one times three. Now, there are other ways to write this sum and sigma notation. For example, we could notice that each of the terms is a multiple of three. And in fact, six is three times two, nine is three times three, and so on. And so we could write our sum as sigma of three times n, where n ranges from two to six. The choice of the letter we use for the index doesn't matter at all. For example, we could also write this as sigma from K equals two to six of three times k. Here, k and n play the same role. Please pause the video for a moment and try to write this next example in sigma notation. Since the denominators are powers of two, we could write the denominators as two to the i, where i ranges from two to five. The numerators are one less than the denominators, so we can write the numerators as two to the i minus one was we're adding these terms up, we write sigma, and we I go from two to five. In this video, we reviewed summation notation, or sigma notation for writing sums. In this video, we'll approximate the area under a curve using tall skinny rectangles, this will introduce the idea of an integral. Let's start by approximating the area under this curve y equals x squared in between x equals zero, and x equals three by approximating it with six rectangles. There's several ways to do this. For example, I could draw rectangles for the right side of each rectangle is as tall as the curve. We'll call this using write endpoints. Alternatively, we could line up our rectangles, so the left side of each rectangle is as high as the curve. We'll call this use Left endpoints. Notice that the leftmost rectangle in this picture is degenerate and has height zero. If we're using the picture with the right endpoints, then the base of each rectangle has size one half. And the height of each rectangle is given by the value of our function, y equals x squared on the right side of the rectangle. So for example, the area of the first rectangle is its base times its height, which is point five times 0.5 squared. The 0.5 squared comes from me evaluating the function at this point 0.5 to get the height. Similarly, the area of the second rectangle is going to be also base times height basis, still point five, and now the height is going to be one squared, or one. If we continue like this, and add up all our areas, we get the area of all six rectangles is given by this expression. Notice that there are six terms here, one for each rectangle, each rectangle has base of point five, and has height given by the right endpoint, we can write this in sigma notation as the sum of 0.5 times 0.5 times i squared, where I ranges from one to six. This works because the numbers in parentheses here are all multiples of point five. The first one is point five times one, and the last one, three is point five times six. Now if we compute the sum, we get 91 eighths, which is 11.375. Notice from the picture, that the sum of areas of rectangles is an over estimate for the area under the curve, we can do the same sort of computation for this green picture using left endpoints, and we'll get an under estimate for the area under the curve, I invite you to try it for yourself before going on with the video. For the green rectangles, the first rectangle has area zero, the second rectangle has area given by its base of 0.5 times its height of 0.5 squared. And if we compute all six areas and add them up, we get a similar expression to the previous one, only this time, we end with a 2.5 squared, which is the height of our last rectangle. One way to write this in sigma notation, is still starting with i equals one for the first rectangle to six for the last one, we use the base. And then for the height, we use 0.5 times I minus one, squared. This works because when I is one, i minus one is zero, so we start with a height of zero like we should. And when I is six, we get point five times six minus one, which is point five times five, or 2.5, just like we want it to be, if we add up the sum, we get an answer of 55 eighths, which is equal to 6.875, which is an underestimate for the true area under the curve. Now there's a big gap between 6.875 and 11.375. So it'd be nice to get tighter bounds on the area. One way to do this is by using more rectangles, for example, 12 rectangles instead of six. Again, we could choose to use right endpoints, which gives us an over estimate of area in this case, or we could use left endpoints, which gives us an under estimate. The area of the eyes rectangle is given by the base times the height, and the base is going to be in this case 0.25. While the height is given by the functions value on the right endpoint, the right endpoint of the eyes rectangle is going to be 0.25 times I and the function is the squaring function. So that height will be given by point two, five i squared. The area of all the rectangles can then be given by the sum from i equals one to 12 for the 12 rectangles of 0.25 times 0.25 i squared. If we work out that sum, it comes to 10.156. Again, we can do the same thing with left endpoints. Now the area of the eye, the rectangle, is given by base times height, which is point two, five. And now the height is given by the value of the function on the left endpoint. So that's going to be 0.25 times I minus one. And we need to square that, since our function y equals x squared is giving the height of my rectangles. So the area of all the rectangles together is going to be the sum from the first rectangle to the 12th rectangle of 0.25 times 0.25, times I minus one squared. That works out to 7.906. So we're honing in on the actual area under the curve. Now it's somewhere between about eight and about 10, we can keep getting better and better estimates of area by using more and more rectangles. For example, if we want to use 100 rectangles, then our area of all rectangles using right endpoints is going to be given by the sum from i equals one to 100 of the basis times the heights. Now the base of each rectangle will be 100 of the length here from zero to three. In other words, the base will be three over 100. The eyes right endpoint, which I'll call X sub i, is going to be just three over 100 times I, since you get to the right eye threat endpoint by taking I copies of a rectangle of width three one hundredths. Therefore, the eyes height is going to be given by this is right endpoint squared, or three one hundredths times i squared. So we can write our sum of areas as sigma from i equals one to 100 of three one hundredths times three one hundredths times i squared. The formula using left endpoints is similar. The if left endpoint is going to be three one hundredths, times I minus one, since if we're using left endpoints, we only have to travel through i minus one rectangles to get to the left endpoint of the rectangle. So our area for the left endpoints becomes the sum from i equals one to 100 of three over 100 times three over 100 times I minus one squared. These two psalms work out to be 9.1435 and 8.8654. At this point, you might be willing to wager a guess that our exact area under the curve is probably going to be nine. But to determine the exact area for sure, let's do this process of dividing into rectangles one more time. And this time, we'll just use an rectangles where n is some big number. Since we're dividing an interval of length three into n little pieces, the width of each sub interval, in other words, the base of each rectangle, we'll be given by three over n. I'll call this delta x as a little tiny bit of x. Now the right endpoint, x by is given by three over n times i. Since we have to travel through I rectangles, each of width three over n on order to get to that right endpoint. So our height, H sub i is given by the functions value on that right endpoint. We can work out similar expressions for the picture using left endpoints here. Our estimate of area using right endpoints is then the sum from i equals one to n of three over n times three I over n squared. And our estimate using left endpoints is a sum from i equals one to n of three over n times three, i minus one over n squared, the more rectangles we use, in other words, the bigger the value of n, the closer our estimated area will be to our exact area under the curve. And therefore, the exact area is given by the limit the limit as n goes to infinity of this song, which is known as a Riemann sum, there are really two possible limits, we could use right endpoints or left endpoints. But as the picture suggests, these two limits should turn out to be the same thing. In fact, there are other options between sides using right endpoints and left endpoints, we could, for example, use the midpoints of our intervals to compute our areas of rectangles. And that limit should also end up as the same thing. So we have an expression for the area under the curve y equals x squared between the values of x equals one and x equals three. And that's given by the limit of this psalm called a Riemann sum. I'll stick with the right endpoint version for now, to compute the exact area, we have to evaluate this limit, which is tricky. I'm going to start by rewriting. Since three and n don't involve the index I, I can pull them outside of this summation sign. I'll clean this up a little bit. Now will you need to use the fact that the sum of the first n squares of the integers is equal to n times n plus one times two n plus one over six, we can check that formula for a few values of n. For example, if n equals two, we're summing out one squared plus two squared, which is five. And we're plugging in two times two plus one times four plus one over six from the formula, which also equals five. If we use this formula, in our limit calculation, we get this expression, which simplifies to nine halves, by dividing 27 by six, we can cancel a copy of n and get n plus one times two n plus one over n squared. I'm going to pull out the nine halves. And now I observe I have the limit of a rational expression, where the highest power term on the numerator is going to be two n squared, the highest power and there's nominators just the n squared, so that's going to be a limit of two, multiply that by by nine halves, and I get a limit of nine, just like I expected from the previous work. So that was a big production. But we did successfully find the area under the curve, and it was nine. In this video, we approximated the area under a curve by taking the limit as the number of rectangles goes to infinity of the area of the rectangles, which is given by a psalm called a Riemann sum of the basis times the heights of the rectangles. The basis are often written as delta x, and the heights are given by the function value on the left endpoint, or the right endpoint, or some other point in the interval. For our purposes, f was always x squared. But this sort of expression, called a Riemann sum, can be used more generally, to evaluate the area under any continuous function. In previous sections, we thought of the definite integral as representing area, and we've computed it as a number. In this section, we'll think of the integral itself as a function of the bounds of integration. And we'll describe the first part of the fundamental theorem relating the derivative and the integral. Suppose f of x has the graph shown here, and let g of x be the integral from one to x of f of t dt. I'm using t as my variable inside my integrand Here, just to distinguish it from the variable x that I'm using in my bounds of integration, this expression just means the net area between one and some value x on the x axis. I'll call geovax, the accumulated area function, because as x increases, g of x, measures how much net area has accumulated. Let's calculate and plot some values of g of x. g of one is the integral from one to one of f of t, dt, that's just zero. Since the bounds of integration here the same, g of two is the integral from one to two of f of t, dt. That's the net area from one to two, which is to square units. g of three is the integral from one to three. Now, we've added on an additional two units here, and an additional one unit up here from this triangle, for a total of five, g of four is g of three with some additional area tacked on the additional area measures three units. So g of four is eight. Please pause the video and fill in the next few values of J. When we go from g of four to g of five, we add on an extra unit of area. So g of five is nine. As we go from g of five to g of six, we start accumulating negative area, because f is now below the x axis. So here I've accumulated one unit of negative area, which means that g of six is one less than g of five. In other words, gf six is eight, g of seven is five. Since we accumulate three more units of negative area, to find g of zero, the integral from one to zero of f of t dt, I'm going to rewrite this integral as negative the integral from zero to one of f of t dt. Since there are two units of area between zero and one, g of zero is negative to apply all these values of G on these coordinate axes, and connect the dots to get an idea of what g of x looks like. Now let's think about the derivative g prime of x. We know that g prime of x is positive, where g of x is increasing, but g of x is increasing, wherever we're adding on positive area, that is when f of x is positive. So we have that g prime of x is positive, where f is x is positive. Also, g prime of x is negative, where g of x is decreasing. That happens when we're adding on negative area because f of x is negative. So we can see that g prime of x is negative, where f of x is negative. Also, g prime is zero at this local maximum, where f is zero. At that instant, we're not adding on any positive or negative area. If we look a little closer, we can see the rate at which g of x is increasing depends on the height of f of x. When f of x is tall, or high, we're adding on area very quickly. While when f of x is low or small, we're adding on area more slowly. So the rate of change of G. In other words, g prime of x is behaving very much like the function f of x itself. And in fact, it turns out that g prime of x is equal to f of x. This is the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part One says that of f of x is a continuous function on the closed interval from a to b, then for any x in this interval, the function g of x, the integral from a to x of f of t dt is continuous on the interval a b and differentiable on the inside of this interval, and for Furthermore, g prime of x is equal to f of x, as we saw in the previous example. The proof of this fact relies on a limit definition of derivative, and can be found in a later video. For now, let's do some examples based on this fact. First, let's find the derivative with respect to x of the integral from five to x of the square root of t squared plus three dt. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that this expression here thought of as a function of x is differentiable, and its derivative is just the integrand function evaluated on x. This is great, we don't have to do any work here at all. To evaluate the derivative, we just plug in x, where we see the T here, the derivative and the second expression is also the square root of x squared plus three, it might seem odd that these two expressions have the same derivative. But remember, in both cases, we're taking the derivative of the accumulated area function. And the rate at which area accumulates doesn't depend on the lower bound of the integral. That is, it doesn't depend on where we start counting, it just depends on the height of the function at x. For this third example, remember that the integral from x to four is the same thing as the negative of the integral from four to x. So we get the negative of the derivative from four to x. and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus, this lesson is negative the square root of x squared plus three, it makes sense that we should get a negative answer for this example. When we're integrating from X to four, then as x increases, our area actually decreases. So our accumulated area function should have a negative derivative. This last example is more complicated, because instead of just having x as our upper bound, we have a function of x sine of x, we can think of sine of x as being the inside function, and the accumulated area function as being an outside function and apply the chain rule. In general, the chain rule says that we have the derivative with respect to x of a function of u of x, then that's the same thing as the derivative with respect to u of that function at U times the derivative of the inside function u of x with respect to x, applying the chain rule to our accumulated area function, where you have x is sine x, we have that the derivative respect to x of the integral from four to sine x of the integral of t squared plus three DT can be written as the derivative by two you, I've accumulated area function from four to you have the integrand times the derivative with respect to x of our u of x, which is just sine x, we can apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to calculate the first derivative. By just plugging in you for T, we get you squared plus three. And then the derivative of sine x, of course, is just cosine of x. Since we want our final answer to be entirely in terms of x, we're going to rewrite this as the square root of sine x squared plus three times cosine x, or just the square root of sine squared x plus three times cosine of x. We could have gotten this answer more quickly by just plugging in this entire expression sine of x in where we saw the T here in the integrand, and then multiplying the answer by the derivative of sine x due to the chain rule. This video introduced the fundamental theorem of calculus part one that says that the derivative of the integral of a function is just the original function in some sense, taking the derivative and does the process of taking the integral. derivatives and integrals are closely related. inverse operations. This video introduces the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Another way of relating derivatives and integrals. Part Two of the fundamental theorem of calculus says that if f is a continuous function on the closed interval a b, then the integral from a to b of f of x dx is equal to capital F of b minus capital F of A, where capital F is any antiderivative for lowercase F. That is, capital F is a function whose derivative is lowercase F. The proof of part two of the fundamental theorem of calculus follows directly from part one. And I'll give that proof in another video. But here, I just want to make a few comments about what this theorem means. If we think of f of x as the derivative of capital F of x, then this is saying that the integral of the derivative is equal to the original function evaluated on the endpoints. I also want to comment on the phrasing any antiderivative. Suppose capital G of X is a different antiderivative for lowercase F. We know that any two anti derivatives differ by a constant. So we know that g of x has to equal capital F of X plus some constant. So if we take g of b minus g of a, that's going to be the same thing as f of b plus c minus f of a plus C. And since this constant sees subtract out to cancel here, this is just f of b minus f of a. So this difference is the same value, no matter which antiderivative of lowercase f we use. And that's why we can say that capital F can be any antiderivative. Part Two of the fundamental theorem of calculus is super useful, because it allows us to compute integrals simply by finding anti derivatives and evaluating them. Finding anti derivatives tends to be really easy. Computing integrals, using the Riemann sum definition is really hard. And so because of the fundamental theorem of calculus, we don't have to go through all those lengthy and tedious computations, we've involving limits of areas of rectangles, all we have to do to evaluate an integral is find an antiderivative, and evaluate it. Let's see how this works in some examples. In this first example, the antiderivative of 3x squared is x cubed. And the antiderivative of negative four over x is minus four times ln absolute value of x. We could add a plus C to make it a general antiderivative, but we don't really need it. The fundamental theorem says that we can use any antiderivative, so we might as well use the simplest one, where c equals zero. Now we need to evaluate this antiderivative on the endpoints of negative one and negative five. And we usually write this as a vertical line with a negative one at the bottom and a negative five at the top to mean evaluation. In other words, the notation capital F of X between A and B means capital F of b minus capital F of A, which is what we need to compute for our antiderivative here. So now we just plug in negative five for x, and then we subtract what we get when we plug in negative one for x. In this example, you can see why it's important to write the antiderivative of one over x as ln absolute value of x not just ln of x, because ln of the absolute value of five, which is ln a five actually has an answer, whereas ln of negative five would not exist. I can simplify this expression a little bit, I get negative 125 minus four ln five minus negative one, plus four ln of one. Since ln of one is zero, this becomes negative 124 minus four ln five. That's about negative 130 point 438. In this next example, we need to find the antiderivative for this expression y squared minus y plus one over the square root Why. Now we can't take the antiderivative separately of the numerator and the denominator, because that's just not how the quotient rule works for differentiation. So it doesn't work that way for anti differentiation either. Instead, let's try to simplify this expression to make it look more like something we can take the antiderivative of. So I'm going to rewrite the denominator as y to the one half power. And dividing by y to the one half is the same thing as multiplying by y to the negative one half distributed, distributing and adding exponents, I get y to the three halves minus y to the one half plus y to the negative one half. Now that's something I can take the antiderivative of just using the power rule and reverse y to the three halves, becomes y to the five halves by adding one to the exponent, I divide by the new exponent. Now here, I get y to the three halves divided by three halves, and here are negative one half plus one is positive one half, I need to evaluate this between four and one. let me simplify a little bit. And now I'll substitute in values. Now four to the five halves is the same thing as four to the one half raised to the fifth power. So that's two to the fifth power, or 32. Similarly, for the three halves is four to the one half cubed, so that's two cubed, or eight, and four to the one half is just two. And one to any power is just one. And after some arithmetic, I get an answer of 146 15th. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, part two can be stated this way, for a function capital F with continuous derivative, the integral of the derivative is equal to the original function evaluated on the bounds of integration. In this video, I'll prove both parts of the fundamental theorem of calculus. The first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus says that if f of x is a continuous function, then the function g of x defined as the integral from a constant A to the variable x of f of t dt is differentiable, and has derivative equal to the original function, f of x. To prove this theorem, let's start with the limit definition of derivative. The derivative, g prime of x, by definition, is the limit as h goes to zero of g of x plus h minus g of x over h. Now g of x is defined as an integral from a to x. So g of x plus h is going to be the integral from a to x plus h, just plugging in x plus h for x of f of t dt. g of x is the integral from a to x of f of t dt. By properties of integrals. The integral from a to x plus h minus the integral from a to x is just the integral from x to x plus h. Now informally, the integral from x to x plus h can be closely approximated by a skinny rectangle with height, f of x and width, H. And so this limit is approximately the limit as h goes to zero of f of x times h over h, which is just f of x. But let's make this argument a little more precise. Let's let capital M be the maximum value that f of x achieves on this little sub interval, and lowercase m be the minimum value achieved. In this picture, they occur on the endpoints of the interval from x to x plus h, but they could also occur somewhere in the interior. But we know that f of x does have to have a minimum value and a maximum value, since it's a continuous function by assumption on a closed interval. Now we know that the integral of f of t dt from x to x plus h has to be less than or equal to capital M times h and bigger than a to lowercase m times h. This is one of the properties of integrals, and can be verified visually by comparing this shaded red area to the small blue rectangle, which has area lowercase m times h, and comparing it to the area of the big rectangle, which has area capital M times h equivalently, the integral from x to x plus H of F of t dt divided by h has to be less than or equal to capital M and greater than or equal to little m. But the intermediate value theorem, which holds for all continuous functions, says that this intermediate value that lies between the minimum and maximum value of f has to be achieved as f of c for some C in the interval. Therefore, I cannot replace this integral in the limit expression above by just simply the value f of c for some c between x and x plus h. The value of C here depends on x and h. But as h goes to zero, C has to get closer and closer to x. And since f is continuous, this means that this limit is equal to f of x. We've now proved the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus, that the derivative of g exists and equals f of x. The second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus says that if f is continuous, then the integral from a to b of f of x dx is equal to the antiderivative of lowercase F, which I'll denote by capital F, evaluated at B minus that antiderivative evaluated today. Part Two of the fundamental theorem follows directly from part one. Let's let g of x be defined as the integral from a to x of f of t dt. Then part one of the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that g prime of x exists and equals lowercase f of x. In other words, capital G is an antiderivative for a lowercase F. Now g of the minus g of A is by definition, the integral from a to b of f of t dt minus the integral of a from a to a of f of t dt. The second integral is zero, since the bounds of integration are identical. So part two of the fundamental theorem of calculus is true if I use the antiderivative capital G. But the theorem is supposed to be true for any antiderivative. So let's let capital F be any antiderivative of lowercase F, we know that capital F of x has to equal capital G of X plus some constant since any two antiderivative for the same function differ by a constant, and therefore, capital F of b minus capital F of A is going to equal capital G of B plus C minus capital G of A plus C. The constant C cancels out, and we just get capital G of b minus capital G of A, which we already saw was equal to the integral from a to b of lowercase f of t dt. So the left side of this equation is equal to the right side. And the fundamental theorem of calculus Part two is proved for any antiderivative. This completes the proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus. This video is about the substitution method for evaluating integrals, also known as u substitution. As the first example, let's try to integrate to x sine of x squared dx. Now sine of x squared is the composition of the function sine and the function x squared. And notice that the function x squared has derivative to x, which is sitting right here and the integrand. I'm going to make the substitution u equals x squared, and then I'll write d u is equal to 2x dx. That's differential notation. To find d u, I take the derivative have X squared and then multiply by the differential dx, I can then rewrite the integrand as sine of u. And the 2x. dx becomes do after making this substitution, I can integrate, because the antiderivative of sine of u is negative cosine of u. And I'll add on the constant of integration. I'm not finished yet, my original problem was in terms of x, and now I've got a function in terms of u. So let's substitute back in since u is equal to x squared, I can replace that, and I have my final answer. To verify that this final answer is correct, that it really is the antiderivative of what we started with, let's take the derivative of our answer and make sure we get back the function to x sine of x squared. If we take the derivative of negative cosine of x squared plus C, then we get the derivative of a constant is zero, so we have the derivative of negative cosine, that's equal to sine of the inside function x squared times the derivative of the inside function using the chain rule. And we do in fact, get back to the integrand that we started with. Notice that we use the chain rule when taking the derivative to check our answer. Let's try some more examples of use substitution. When looking for what to substitute as you, it's good to look for a chunk that's in the integrand, whose derivative is also in the integrand. It's also good enough to just have a constant multiple of the derivative in the integrand. So in the first example, we might use the chunk one plus 3x squared, as are you. The derivative of that expression is six times x. And even though six times x isn't completely in the integrand, we do have a factor of x in the numerator, that's just a constant multiple away from the derivative of 6x. So let's write out d u, that's going to be 6x dx. And I'm going to go ahead and rewrite this as x dx is equal to one six d U. writing it this way, it makes it easy to substitute one six d u for x dx. And then in my denominator, my one plus 3x squared becomes u. I can rewrite this as one six times the integral of one over u d u you and I recognize that the antiderivative of one over u is ln absolute value of u. Substituting back in for you, I get a final answer of one six ln absolute value of one plus 3x squared, plus say, the absolute value signs are not really necessary in this example, since one plus 3x squared is always positive. As our next example, let's look at the integral of e to the 7x dx. one chunk with us here is u equals 7x. If we do that, then d u is just seven dx. And so we have dx is equal to 1/7 do substituting in we have the integral of e to the u times 1/7 d u, I can pull the 1/7 out and integrate e to the u to the app, just either the U and substituting in for back for 7x, I get e to the 7x plus C. I encourage you to pause the video to check that these two answers are correct. By taking derivatives. You'll notice that you use the chain rule each time. Next, let's do an example with a definite integral, the integral from E to E squared of ln x over x dx. If we set u equal to ln x, then d u is the derivative of ln x, that's one of our x times dx. This is a much better choice of you than say setting u equal to x from the denominator, because then d u would just be dx. And when we did the substitution, nothing would really change. For definite integrals, we need to deal with the bounds of integration here e and d squared. We really have two options, worry about them now or worry about them later. I'll show you the worry about them. Now method first. Our bounds of integration E and E squared are values of Bax as we convert everything in our integral from x to you, we need to convert the bounds of integration from values of x to values of u also. Now, when x is equal to e, u is equal to ln IV, which is one, just using this equation. Similarly, when x is equal to E squared, u is equal to ln t squared, which is two. So as I rewrite my integral, I'm going to replace the bounds with one and two. And now my ln x becomes my u and my dx divided by x becomes my do, they're going to grow of UD u is equal to use squared over two, and I evaluate this between the bounds of u equals two and u equals one to get two squared over two minus one squared over two, which is one half. Notice that when we did the problem this way, we never actually had to get back to our variable x, we stayed in the variable u and evaluated. The second way of dealing with the bounds of integration is to worry about them later. Let's go back to the beginning of the problem. We're just about to substitute u equals ln x and d u equals one over x dx. Instead of substituting in for the bounds of integration, I'm going to temporarily ignore them and just evaluate the indefinite integral ln x over x dx, which I can substitute in as you times do, we can evaluate that to get you squared over two. Normally we'd have a plus c constant. But since we're ultimately going to be doing a definite integral, we don't really need the constant here. Now, just like when we're doing indefinite integrals, I'm going to get back to the variable x by substituting back in for you U is ln of x. So I square that and divided by two, and then I can go back to my original bounds of integration, those bounds are the x values of E squared, and E. Plugging in those bounds, I get ln of E squared quantity squared over two minus ln of E squared over two, which evaluates to two squared over two minus one over two, which is again, one half. This video gave some examples of use substitution to evaluate integrals. This method works great in examples like this one, where there's a chunk that you can call you whose derivative or at least a constant multiple of its derivative is also in the integrand. You've already seen how u substitution works in practice. In this video, I'll try to explain why it works. u substitution is based on the chain rule. Recall the chain rule says if we take the derivative of a function, capital F of lowercase g of x with respect to x, we get the derivative of capital F evaluated on the inside function g of x times the derivative of g of x. If we just write that equation in the opposite order, we have that an expression of the form f prime of g of x times g prime of x can all be wrapped up as the derivative of a composite function, f of g of x. Now if I take the integral of both sides of this equation with respect to x, on the right side, I'm taking the integral of a derivative. Well, the integral or antiderivative of a derivative is just the original function, capital f of g of x plus C. Now when we do use substitution, we're really just writing this equation down. We are seeing an expression of the form f prime of g of x times g prime of x dx, we're recognizing you as g of x and d u as g prime of x dx. So we're rewriting this expression as the integral of capital F prime of u d u do and that integrates to just capital F of u plus C. And then we're substituting back in for you To get capital f of g of x plus C, the beginning and end of this process are exactly the same as the left side and right side of our chain rule expression above. So when you're doing u substitution to integrate, you can thank this chain rule that's behind it all. This video introduces the idea of an average value of a function. To take the average of a finite list of numbers, we just add the numbers up and divide by n, the number of numbers. In summation notation, we write the sum from i equals one to n of Q i all divided by n. But defining the average value of a continuous function is a little different. Because a function can take on infinitely many values on an interval from a to b, we could estimate the average value of the function by sampling it at a finite Li many evenly spaced x values. I'll call them x one through x n. And let's assume that they're spaced a distance of delta x apart, then the average value of f at these sample points is just the sum of the values of f divided by n, the number of values are in summation notation, the sum from i equals one to n of f of x i all divided by n. This is an approximate average value of f, since we're just using n sample points. But the approximation gets better as the number of sample points n gets bigger and bigger. So we could define the average as the limit as n goes to infinity of the sample average. I'd like to make this look more like a Riemann sum. So I need to get delta x in there. So I'm just going to multiply the top and the bottom by delta x. And notice that n times delta x is just the length of the interval b minus a. Now as the number of sample points goes to infinity, delta x, the distance between them goes to zero. So I can rewrite my limit as the limit as delta x goes to zero, of the sum of FX II times delta x divided by b minus a. Now the limit of this Riemann sum in the numerator is just the integral from a to b of f of x dx. And so the average value of the function is given by the integral on the interval from a to b divided by the length of the interval. Notice the similarity between the formula for the average value of a function and the formula for the average value of a list of numbers, the integral for the function corresponds to the summation sign for the list of numbers. And the length of the interval B minus A for the function corresponds to n, the number of numbers in the list of numbers. Now let's work an example. For the function g of x equals one over one minus 5x. On the interval from two to five, we know that the average value of G is given by the integral from two to five of one over one minus 5x dx divided by the length of that interval, I'm going to use use of the tuition to integrate, so I'm going to set u equal to one minus 5x. So d u is negative five dx. In other words, dx is negative 1/5 times do. Looking at my bounds of integration, when x is equal to two, u is equal to one minus five times two, which is negative nine. And when x is equal to five, u is equal to negative 24. substituting into my integral, I get the integral from negative nine to negative 24 of one over u times negative 1/5. Do and that's divided by three. Now dividing by three is same as multiplying by 1/3. And as I integrate, I'm going to pull the negative 1/5 out and then take the integral of one over u, that's ln of the absolute value of u evaluated in between negative 24 and negative nine. The absolute value signs are important here because they prevent me from trying to take the natural log of negative numbers to evaluate get negative 1/15 times ln of 24 minus ln of nine, I can use my log rolls to simplify and get negative 1/15 ln of 24 over nine, that's negative 1/15 ln of eight thirds, and as a decimal, that's approximately negative 0.0654. So I found the average value of G. Now my next question is, does g ever achieve that average value, in other words, is there a number c in the interval from two to five for which GFC equals its average value? Well, one way to find out is just to set GFC equal to G's average value. In other words, set one over one minus five c equal to negative 1/15 ln of eight thirds, and try to solve for C. There are lots of ways to solve this equation. But I'm going to take the reciprocal of both sides, subtract one from both sides and divide by negative five. This simplifies to three over ln of eight thirds, plus 1/5, which is approximately 3.25. And that x value does lie inside the interval from two to five. So we've demonstrated that g does achieve its average value over the interval. But in fact, we could have predicted this to be true. Gs average value has to lie somewhere between GS minimum value and maximum value on this interval. And since G is continuous on the interval from two to five, it has to achieve every value that lies in between as minimum and maximum, including its average value. The same argument shows that for any continuous function, the function must achieve its average value on an interval. And this is known as the mean value theorem for integrals. Namely, for any continuous function f of x on an interval from a to b, there has to be at least one number c, between A and B, such that f of c equals its average value, or, in symbols, f of c equals the integral from A b of f of x dx divided by b minus a. This video gave the definition of an average value of a function, and stated the mean value theorem for integrals. If we rewrite the formula for average value a little, then we can see a geometric interpretation for average value, the area of the box with height the average value is the same as the area under the curve. This video gives two proofs of the mean value theorem for integrals. the mean value theorem for integrals says the for continuous function f of x, defined on an interval from a to b, there's some number c between A and B, such that f of c is equal to the average value of f. The first proof that I'm going to give us is the intermediate value theorem. Recall that the intermediate value theorem says that if we have a continuous function f, defined on an interval, which I'll call x 1x, two, if we have some number l in between f of x one and f of x two, then f has to achieve the value out somewhere between x one and x two. Keeping in mind the intermediate value theorem, let's turn our attention back to the mean value theorem for integrals. Now it's possible that our function f of x might be constant on the interval from a to b. But if that's true, then our mean value theorem for integrals holds easily, because f AV is just equal to that constant, which is equal to f OC for any c between A and B. So let's assume that f is not constant. Well, like continuous function on a closed interval has to have a minimum value and a maximum value, which I'll call little m, and big M. Now we know that F's average value on the interval has to be between its maximum value and its minimum value. If you don't believe this, consider the fact that all of us values on the interval have to lie between big M and little m. And if we integrate this inequality We get little m times b minus a is less than or equal to the integral of f is less than or equal to big M times b minus a. Notice that the first and the last integrals, we're just integrating a constant. Now if I divide all three sides by b minus a, I can see that little m is less than or equal to the average value of f is less than or equal to big M as I wanted. Now, I just need to apply the intermediate value theorem, with F average as my number L and little m and big M as my values of f of x one and f of x two. The intermediate value theorem says that F average is achieved by f of c for some C in between my x one and x two. And therefore, for some C in my interval a b. And that proves the mean value theorem for integrals. Now I'm going to give a second proof for the mean value theorem for integrals. And this time, it's going to be as a corollary to the regular mean value theorem for functions. Recall that the mean value theorem for functions, says that if g of x is continuous on a closed interval, and differentiable on the interior of that interval, then there's some number c in the interval, such that the derivative of g at C is equal to the average rate of change of G, across the whole interval from a to b. Let's keep the mean value theorem for functions in mind, and turn our attention back to the mean value theorem for integrals. I'm going to define a function g of x to be the integral from a to x of f of t dt, where F is the function given to us in the statement of the mean value theorem for integrals. Notice that g of A is just the integral from a to a, which is zero, while g of B is the integral from a to b of our function. Now, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, our function g of x is continuous and differentiable on the interval a, b, and g prime of x is equal to f of x. And by the mean value theorem for functions, we know that g prime of c has to equal g of b minus g of a over b minus a, for some numbers, C and the interval a b, if we substitute in the three facts above, into our equation below, we get f of c is equal to the integral from a to b of f of t dt minus zero over b minus a, which is exactly the conclusion that we wanted to reach. This shows that the mean value theorem for integrals really is the mean value theorem for functions where our function is an integral. And this completes the second proof of the main value theorem for integrals. So now I've proved the mean value theorem for integrals in two different ways. And I've used a lot of the great theorems of calculus along the way.
