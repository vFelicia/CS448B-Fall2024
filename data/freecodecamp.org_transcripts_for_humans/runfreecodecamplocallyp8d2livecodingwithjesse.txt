00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:11 - going to pick up right where we left off
00:13 - last week in the last stream
00:15 - and we're getting free code cam
00:18 - to run locally
00:20 - so when i say free code camp i mean
00:23 - the
00:24 - the lessons the curriculum on
00:26 - freecodecam.org
00:28 - so if you didn't see the last stream
00:30 - here's a quick recap of what we're
00:31 - trying to do
00:34 - we want to make
00:36 - we want to add some react native lessons
00:39 - so gwen faraday has created a react
00:43 - native
00:45 - curriculum
00:46 - and
00:48 - we want to get that running in the
00:49 - browser
00:51 - all right so react native does not run
00:53 - in the browser
00:56 - you know just as is but we can use react
00:58 - native web to make it run in the browser
01:01 - so step one is
01:03 - getting it
01:05 - getting the curriculum to run locally
01:08 - which we started last time
01:10 - so we'll finish that up this time
01:12 - hopefully
01:13 - and
01:14 - we'll get that running
01:16 - so
01:17 - hold on one second
01:25 - all right
01:28 - i forgot to get my music on
01:30 - i
01:31 - usually stream with music in the
01:34 - background because
01:40 - all right can y'all hear me
01:42 - everything cut out for a second i don't
01:45 - know what happened
01:47 - i think i'm back uh
01:49 - all right
01:50 - that was weird there's something with my
01:52 - internet
01:54 - i don't know
01:56 - all right
01:57 - but anyway i like to play music in the
01:59 - background and then that way i i speak a
02:01 - little bit louder otherwise i tend to be
02:04 - kind of a low
02:05 - low kind of speaker so
02:08 - i want to make sure y'all can hear me
02:12 - okay so i'm gonna get
02:17 - some music playing in the background
02:26 - all right i have a lot of stuff in the
02:28 - chat right now
02:29 - so
02:32 - i'm going to
02:34 - check on the chat in about uh 25 minutes
02:37 - or so
02:38 - uh and then
02:43 - oh yeah there's a lot of stuff so i'm
02:44 - just gonna say hey to everybody and then
02:46 - i'm gonna check on the chat about 25
02:48 - minutes
02:50 - and
02:52 - i also want to let everybody know that i
02:54 - probably won't be streaming
02:56 - next week
02:58 - so probably won't have another stream
03:00 - until the week after
03:01 - so i'm gonna be in chicago at the end of
03:04 - the week for the react loop conference
03:05 - so anybody in chicago
03:07 - um
03:09 - let me know
03:10 - i have a very limited time in chicago
03:12 - i'll be there thursday
03:15 - and then just in the morning on friday
03:16 - and then i'm going to fly back
03:18 - so if i know anybody in chicago and you
03:21 - want to hang out let me know quickly and
03:23 - then maybe we can hang out on thursday
03:26 - and then after that i'm going to come
03:28 - back on friday afternoon and then drive
03:32 - to the beach with my family
03:34 - so i'll be going all week with them
03:37 - and i'm not going to try to stream
03:39 - from the beach
03:43 - okay
03:46 - all right so let's see
03:49 - it's been a week since we worked on this
03:51 - so
03:53 - i need to get up to date on this
03:55 - all right so the last thing that we
03:57 - were working
03:58 - on was trying to get to run
04:02 - locally
04:04 - and that was our
04:05 - that was kind of our challenge right
04:08 - uh also you know let me get a pomodoro
04:10 - clock running
04:14 - and
04:17 - let's do this
04:20 - trying to see where the best place to
04:21 - run this
04:26 - is thought i had one up already but
04:31 - i guess not
04:33 - pomodoro clock is just gonna be like a
04:35 - 25 minute timer
04:42 - okay
04:49 - all right so this is
04:53 - our package json so here these are the
04:55 - uh
04:56 - kind of like the commands that we have
04:58 - we're working with right now
05:00 - see challenges
05:03 - all right so we're going to want to see
05:04 - the challenges
05:06 - but first we actually need to i believe
05:09 - we need to do is get this running
05:12 - so let's check out our
05:16 - let me let me pull over a window here
05:19 - uh browser window
05:26 - i thought i had one going but
05:28 - from the last time i didn't close
05:30 - anything from the last time but you know
05:32 - how it is when you have too many windows
05:33 - open it's easier just open a new one
05:35 - then then define the one you have open
05:38 - all right so
05:40 - we're gonna go to github's free code
05:42 - camp
05:55 - and let's check out the
05:58 - contributing guide
06:06 - uh if you're going to do an open source
06:09 - project
06:12 - sometimes you'll find there's a
06:14 - contributing.md
06:16 - and always make sure you read that you
06:18 - have a much better chance of getting
06:20 - your pull request actually merged if you
06:23 - follow the instructions
06:30 - let's see
06:32 - there we go
06:38 - all right so we've done
06:40 - a lot of this stuff
06:46 - yes we've done this we've done this
07:14 - oh interesting okay so they recommend
07:16 - using docker
07:20 - i do not remember seeing that last time
07:23 - um
07:25 - so they
07:28 - i don't
07:29 - think i have docker installed on this
07:31 - machine
07:33 - so docker is uh like a container system
07:49 - since we already started with
07:53 - the local build stuff
07:55 - i think we'll just go on with that maybe
07:57 - if i have time i'll check out the docker
07:59 - thing and maybe we'll switch to that but
08:01 - for now
08:03 - i
08:04 - think this is probably
08:10 - probably the best way to go
08:28 - okay so we've done this
08:30 - environment variable thing
08:32 - let's see we're not on the docker build
08:36 - okay so that's the docker build we don't
08:38 - want that
08:52 - all above needs to be run only the first
08:54 - time you set up the local dev
08:56 - environment
09:06 - what is
09:07 - ci is let's um
09:11 - i do not believe we ran
09:13 - a ci on npm
09:16 - so let's do that
09:28 - also i believe we found that there's
09:30 - kind of a different structure here
09:34 - um so there's lerna was being used
09:38 - so we might
09:40 - and this is basically
09:43 - on the main branch there's a different
09:45 - structure to the project than on this
09:47 - branch the react native challenges
09:49 - branch
09:51 - so
09:54 - we're going to have to
09:58 - maybe do it a little bit differently
10:00 - so
10:03 - we'll see if we can't get this working
10:05 - we'll see
10:10 - lerna basically um
10:13 - lets you have kind of a structure where
10:14 - you you have um
10:16 - like your main project and a package
10:18 - json at the main level and then you have
10:21 - folders within that that also have their
10:24 - own package jsons and it ties them all
10:27 - together
10:28 - uh i wonder if i can see an example okay
10:30 - so like this is our main package json
10:34 - right
10:36 - and
10:39 - let's see if we have
10:40 - another one here
10:46 - yeah so then we have this this sub
10:49 - package here
10:55 - with its own set of stuff
10:57 - right so that's
10:59 - that's uh l-e-r-n-a is lerna so you
11:02 - could check it out if you want
11:05 - uh i haven't used it for a project but i
11:08 - was considering it for a project that
11:09 - i'm working on
11:14 - hopefully i know enough about it that we
11:16 - can get through this otherwise with to
11:18 - do a little more research
11:20 - all right let's go back to our docs
11:22 - our contributing documentation
11:28 - hey and i think i found the
11:31 - one i was originally looking at
11:33 - okay
11:34 - um on windows
11:39 - let's see we need to start mongodb in a
11:42 - separate terminal
11:53 - okay so let's try to run this
11:57 - i don't remember which one we installed
11:59 - all right let's let's check out our
12:02 - program files mongodb server 3.6 let's
12:05 - see which one we did all right it opened
12:07 - on another window
12:08 - let me just check this out
12:19 - see
12:20 - program files mongodb
12:23 - server all right we have 4.0
12:26 - okay
12:28 - so we should be able to just
12:31 - copy this
12:34 - and we'll run this in
12:35 - [Music]
12:37 - we'll just run this
12:39 - on another little spot
12:41 - another terminal here
12:48 - i believe that was the command let me
12:49 - double check that though
12:53 - mongod that's that's what we wanted i
12:56 - think we had some issues with commands
12:58 - not working so
12:59 - we'll see if this works
13:02 - oops nope that's
13:05 - all not so that's not it
13:08 - uh
13:09 - let's see
13:15 - how did we get that working last time
13:24 - let's see
13:25 - um
13:26 - in the comments it says you can add that
13:28 - path to your environment variables and
13:30 - just run it typing mongod in the
13:32 - terminal
13:38 - oh okay
13:44 - all right that's cool that works um
13:51 - ratted to your environment variables
13:54 - oh or i can cd into that folder and just
13:57 - run it from there you know what that's
13:59 - how we
14:00 - that's how we got it last time thank you
14:02 - brandon so brandon's saying that's where
14:04 - he got stuck last time and that's what i
14:05 - just realized awesome
14:07 - okay so let's
14:09 - let's get that working i'm just gonna
14:11 - cd out of here
14:14 - um let's see if i can get this
14:20 - whoa
14:30 - oops
14:41 - there we go
15:01 - what was it server yeah
15:06 - 4.0
15:07 - and then i think it was ben after that
15:10 - was that
15:10 - it yeah ben
15:17 - okay there we go
15:21 - now we can run this
15:27 - whoops i just need to run it
15:34 - all right i'm checking i'm checking the
15:37 - memory says i think adding it to the
15:38 - environment was a better choice to avoid
15:40 - cd every time yeah i think you're
15:42 - absolutely right i'm just doing it this
15:44 - way
15:45 - so that we can try to get it started
15:46 - quickly
15:47 - um but yeah you're right i think there's
15:49 - some setup that
15:52 - um that should happen there georgette
15:56 - says it looks like a live stream on how
15:57 - to debug yeah that's pretty much what
15:59 - this ends up being most of the time we
16:02 - actually get stuff done too but
16:04 - um especially when we're starting a
16:05 - project or doing something new
16:08 - it does end up being a lot of debugging
16:11 - all right um
16:12 - let's see
16:14 - so we need to run the
16:17 - dot exe
16:24 - um
16:25 - so let's see
16:28 - okay mommy's giving me the command here
16:30 - so
16:34 - let's go
16:44 - there we go
16:46 - all right cool let's see
16:49 - what happened here
16:59 - i'm gonna go starting
17:18 - on the localhost
17:34 - all right cool so it looks like it
17:35 - worked
17:44 - at me reminding me you're on windows
17:46 - jesse i know i know i normally develop
17:48 - on a mac so uh but i stream from uh pc
17:52 - so
17:53 - uh
17:54 - it's when it
17:55 - there's definitely some differences that
17:57 - i need to get used to
17:59 - so i probably only use a pc
18:02 - i don't know like
18:03 - five percent of the time that i'm on a
18:06 - computer probably less uh so
18:09 - apollo is used for being a little rusty
18:11 - for the pc
18:13 - okay so i think we have this working
18:16 - and so let's see if we can go on to the
18:18 - next step which is
18:20 - i believe seeding the database
18:25 - yep
18:26 - so we'll do npm run
18:29 - seed
18:44 - okay cool that that looks like
18:47 - it's working
18:50 - she completed
18:58 - inserted 200 new articles awesome okay
19:02 - very cool
19:08 - and you should be able to type npm run
19:11 - develop
19:14 - and that'll do everything so i'm hoping
19:16 - that this part is all the same
19:19 - on this uh branch
19:22 - and we'll find out in a second
19:31 - okay
19:35 - i'm just
19:37 - i'm i'm not used to switching
19:40 - between uh windows on
19:42 - a pc
19:43 - on a mac like there's really cool
19:45 - shortcuts to just flip around different
19:47 - like desktops so
19:50 - sorry i'm so slow
19:59 - oh it's doing stuff
20:10 - oh yeah we're using gatsby i forgot if
20:13 - your code camp was built with gatsby
20:25 - all right so we're getting a bunch of
20:27 - messages but nothing that's like
20:30 - oh here we go graphql error
20:33 - challenge us
20:38 - okay so we did actually get an error
20:40 - here
20:48 - hmm
21:01 - interesting
21:03 - all right let's go to our
21:06 - package.json
21:08 - and see if some if it's different
21:17 - all right i believe the seed command is
21:20 - different
21:25 - but i mean not the command just like the
21:27 - the script so the name of the script
21:34 - looks like develops the same
21:56 - interesting let's try
22:00 - oh okay
22:01 - in the chat it looks like a few you're
22:03 - telling me to do alt tab to change the
22:06 - windows let's see
22:10 - oh okay cool and it brings up all my
22:12 - windows
22:13 - awesome
22:15 - it's bringing them up on another screen
22:17 - but like
22:19 - oh that's really cool
22:24 - okay
22:28 - all right let's see
22:29 - so we typed in
22:33 - i'm going to try to force myself to use
22:34 - this
22:37 - alt tab
22:46 - dang it i must not have done it right
22:55 - all right i need to get
22:57 - the hang of this okay
22:59 - so we
23:00 - ran
23:03 - npm run develop
23:07 - but did we ever run
23:14 - yeah we didn't run any type of
23:19 - basically what i'm looking at are these
23:21 - commands
23:23 - here like this
23:25 - this stuff which is um
23:29 - the learner stuff
23:34 - so i think that's what i want to run is
23:37 - this
23:40 - so there's a
23:44 - free bootstrap
23:48 - post install
23:51 - okay
23:58 - let's see
24:08 - all right i'm gonna run some of these
24:10 - i'm not 100 sure
24:12 - that
24:15 - these are what i need to run but
24:18 - let's see
24:25 - i lost my terminals
24:27 - there we go
24:38 - i'm going to cancel
24:40 - wait is that how it works here
24:44 - maybe
24:46 - i could
24:55 - no how am i supposed to get out here
25:00 - there we go it just took a while to kill
25:02 - them all
25:06 - that's such a violent command right to
25:08 - kill the processes
25:10 - could you say like
25:11 - stop them
25:13 - shut them down
25:17 - okay
25:20 - i got about four minutes until i'm gonna
25:22 - go to the chat and answer some questions
25:23 - so if you're
25:25 - if you've been waiting for me to read
25:26 - your comment just hang in there almost
25:28 - there
25:29 - all right so
25:30 - what i want to try to run is this
25:33 - pre-bootstrap
25:35 - bootstrap and then
25:37 - i guess i can do
25:41 - preboot strap and post install
25:45 - although it seems like
25:51 - it seems like this probably should have
25:52 - run
25:53 - already after we did
25:56 - an npm install
26:00 - but i want to make sure that it it
26:02 - actually ran
26:15 - okay
26:16 - thank you for the uh shortcut for the
26:19 - terminal who did that um
26:22 - so
26:24 - uh so rob
26:26 - sorry if i'm mispronouncing your name
26:28 - but thank you for the the command there
26:33 - okay
26:36 - all right so let's try
26:40 - um
26:43 - npm
26:45 - run
26:47 - what are we gonna do pre
26:50 - bootstrap
26:54 - and this is gonna do the ensure
26:56 - environment
27:00 - okay like i said this stuff may have run
27:02 - already and i just didn't catch it
27:12 - all right now
27:13 - from what i know about learner let's see
27:16 - similar game through shop10
27:18 - packages all right i kind of think that
27:21 - this stuff ran already
27:25 - and
27:29 - now let's
27:31 - try
27:34 - develop
27:46 - all right so i'm kind of expecting we're
27:48 - gonna get the same
27:50 - thing the same errors we did before
27:52 - but i just wanted to try it out
27:58 - just in case oh now we're getting the
28:01 - same thing this graphql error unknown
28:03 - field challenge node
28:04 - on type query
28:11 - on news article node
28:36 - hmm
28:52 - all right so we're still having those
28:53 - graphql issues
28:59 - we did the seed right
29:01 - we ran the seed command
29:09 - when does this start develop
29:13 - so develop
29:15 - okay so the develop command does run
29:18 - start develop okay and it looks like
29:22 - an ensure environment start to build up
29:26 - okay so this already runs
29:33 - and we ran seed
29:51 - okay
29:52 - i want to
29:53 - see what we ran
29:55 - okay so we did do seeds so that should
29:58 - have seeded
29:59 - challenges and news
30:08 - we do so this command here that this
30:10 - seed and then
30:11 - the little asterisk up here that means
30:14 - it'll run
30:15 - all the commands
30:17 - that
30:18 - have you know seed colon so it should
30:21 - have seeded both
30:30 - okay
30:31 - i think my timer yeah my timer's up i
30:34 - didn't get a notification so
30:38 - unless i just missed it but anyway let's
30:40 - let's go
30:42 - to the questions and then hopefully
30:45 - one of us has some idea where to go next
30:47 - because we keep hitting this graphql
30:49 - error
30:55 - all right i'm going to scroll off to the
30:57 - top try to get through as many questions
30:59 - as i can
31:05 - let's see
31:09 - all right so i have a few people asking
31:11 - me what this is about
31:12 - um
31:14 - i explained it at the beginning uh and
31:16 - then on the last stream that i did i
31:19 - also explained a lot more
31:22 - so i'm gonna just say like refer back to
31:24 - the beginning
31:27 - uh gabriel says what is what is the code
31:30 - camp all about um free code camp is
31:36 - a non-profit organization that helps
31:38 - people learn how to code for free it has
31:40 - a lot of things so it has
31:42 - the the lessons on freecodecamp.org that
31:45 - are like two coding tutorials
31:48 - um it has a bunch of uh blog posts a
31:52 - youtube channel a podcast
31:54 - a whole like wiki site
31:57 - uh a forum
31:58 - so i'm probably missing out on stuff but
32:01 - there's just a ton of resources for
32:03 - people to learn how to code all of it is
32:04 - completely free
32:08 - okay
32:11 - there's a ton of stuff in the chat so
32:13 - i'm trying to scroll through quickly
32:14 - apologies if i miss your question
32:18 - rusty asks what language is it we're
32:20 - going to be using javascript
32:34 - let's see
32:47 - all right uh georgette says hey jesse do
32:50 - you think you can create a series in
32:51 - which you create an app with react
32:53 - native
32:54 - so actually the the last project that we
32:57 - worked on that we're not finished yet is
33:00 - a react native app so we're gonna go
33:02 - back to that once we get done with this
33:05 - uh so that'll be
33:07 - project seven
33:09 - so you can go back and look at all the
33:11 - project seven videos on free code camp
33:14 - uh just just my videos the live coding
33:16 - with jesse stuff
33:18 - to get an idea of
33:20 - how you would do a react native app
33:27 - uh
33:28 - prince the boss says do you use pomodoro
33:30 - to get yourself into the flow state when
33:32 - you start
33:33 - yes i do try to use pomodoro when i can
33:37 - at my my normal job so i'm a software
33:39 - engineer at dick's sporting goods
33:43 - we do a lot of pair programming it's
33:45 - kind of harder to get in the flow state
33:47 - when you pay a program
33:50 - but
33:51 - when i can i do
33:53 - try to get in that flow state and i
33:56 - do use pomodoro technique
33:59 - but it's not always possible when you're
34:00 - pair programming
34:04 - meltdown is asking for a shout out hey
34:06 - meltdown
34:13 - uh gregory says wondering is there any
34:15 - free code campers in georgia hey any
34:17 - free code campers in georgia
34:21 - give a shout in the chat or in the
34:22 - comments
34:38 - uh let's see
34:40 - uh ready and says can i fork yeah yeah
34:42 - for sure you can fork this repo um
34:45 - anybody can contribute to the free code
34:47 - camp repo it's not like uh
34:50 - um
34:51 - there's no prerequisites or anything
34:53 - well i guess you have to be smart enough
34:54 - to get it running which
34:56 - evidently i'm not there yet but i'm
34:58 - gonna get there
35:07 - and then he says hello jesse how are you
35:09 - doing
35:10 - uh hey i'm
35:12 - guess i'm doing all right um
35:16 - pretty busy this week getting ready for
35:17 - the conference and um
35:20 - uh for vacation and everything but other
35:22 - than that i'm doing all right thanks for
35:23 - asking
35:28 - uh goulet says do you have save
35:30 - recordings of your teaching javascript
35:32 - and html
35:34 - uh yeah so all my
35:36 - live streams are recorded
35:38 - and they're saved
35:40 - on here on the free code camp channel
35:42 - just search for
35:43 - live coding with jesse or check out the
35:49 - sorry check out the live coding with
35:51 - jesse playlist
35:52 - you can also check out my youtube
35:54 - channel the links in the description
35:56 - i have some tutorial videos there and
35:59 - also some live streams there
36:01 - and i'm gonna try to put out a video
36:04 - before i go on go to my conference or
36:06 - before i go to vacation on vacation um
36:10 - this next week um so i haven't decided
36:14 - exactly what the topic will be but i'd
36:15 - like to do another kind of short
36:17 - tutorial video
36:19 - since i haven't done one for a while
36:24 - okay
36:33 - i didn't get through everything
36:40 - so i'm going to mark down the time stamp
36:42 - where i left off so i can go right back
36:44 - to it
36:53 - he says i think if you empty your cash
36:55 - and try again the arrow will go
36:58 - okay
37:00 - um
37:05 - let's see
37:09 - all right that's where the shot
37:11 - should you empty
37:16 - how am i supposed to empty my cash
37:18 - remember this is a silly question but
37:21 - um
37:27 - let me know
37:29 - i'm not sure
37:34 - uh who's
37:36 - who's scifi
37:39 - says looks like you're really tired
37:42 - i'm tired it's it's uh it's not that
37:44 - early here it's 7 42 a.m
37:47 - um so it's not super early but
37:50 - i am a little tired
37:58 - okay
37:59 - um somebody asked me how many people are
38:01 - watching right now that's a good
38:03 - question i didn't really check uh 123
38:06 - people right now
38:08 - so that's kind of cool
38:15 - that's that's a decent amount of people
38:25 - all right lettuces do a clean build
38:29 - all
38:30 - right let's get this out of here we
38:33 - don't need to
38:44 - see all right i'm gonna hide this on the
38:47 - side just for a second here because
38:50 - we don't really need it also going to
38:54 - give us some more space here
39:02 - okay
39:25 - everybody
39:26 - keep getting comments about why is it so
39:28 - dark down here it's dark right now
39:30 - because
39:31 - well number one it's it's dark outside
39:33 - because it's raining
39:34 - yes it's very cloudy
39:36 - i'm also in a basement
39:39 - so
39:40 - it's pretty it's pretty dark and um
39:43 - i just left the lights off because
39:45 - there's less glare on the screen
39:48 - it's okay
39:59 - all right
40:01 - so i guess we could try
40:05 - oops
40:11 - oh i know what i wanted to do
40:13 - um
40:15 - so
40:17 - we are running on a
40:20 - on a fork on a different branch
40:23 - so
40:24 - it may be that
40:26 - there are different instructions
40:31 - so let's go
40:38 - we go
40:41 - so we're gonna go to gwen faraday's
40:44 - uh repo
40:46 - and
40:47 - [Music]
40:49 - we're gonna
40:50 - there we go we're gonna go to her branch
40:53 - and see if
40:56 - nah i don't think so
41:01 - i was hoping that there are updates to
41:03 - the contributing file but
41:08 - i don't
41:08 - think there is
41:15 - actually we would want this file right
41:19 - set up free code camp locally
41:40 - i'm just trying to see if there's a
41:41 - difference here or i don't think there
41:43 - is
41:49 - no definitely not
41:50 - okay
42:01 - i probably should just open the local
42:02 - host just to
42:04 - yeah just to verify
42:06 - that it's not going to run
42:20 - oh okay so we got some more so hammy
42:22 - says um
42:25 - that's what i found on github's gatsby
42:27 - page the error was found before you can
42:29 - search for the error message on google
42:31 - and you'll find the steps okay cool
42:34 - thanks so much
42:36 - so
42:37 - let's just google that error
42:40 - um
42:42 - i'm not sure which
42:47 - which era
42:52 - i'm gonna feel
43:09 - let's just grab this one
43:13 - all right
43:14 - well let me see we could try npm cash
43:16 - clean
43:22 - whoa
43:24 - okay so feels encryption shoes
43:27 - interesting
43:40 - all right
43:47 - i can force this command if i want to
43:50 - just do that
44:01 - i love it you're using force i sure hope
44:03 - you know what you're doing
44:04 - all right cool
44:13 - and i believe the command that they said
44:16 - was
44:31 - all right so let's try that also let's
44:35 - look up
44:36 - i want to go back to the free code cam
44:38 - thing
44:39 - and i want to try to look up
44:42 - this error
44:45 - uh
44:51 - yeah i didn't think that
44:54 - this error would come up specifically
45:03 - usb issues
45:13 - all right yeah this was like this same
45:15 - error
45:34 - no
45:35 - yeah i don't think that's it
45:41 - all right cool
45:47 - so let's try this now
45:52 - develop that's it
46:05 - oops i'm used to using yarn
46:09 - and you don't have to type run with
46:12 - that
46:30 - hmm
46:36 - okay same thing
46:48 - let's see i'm checking the chat here to
46:50 - see
46:51 - what advice
46:57 - everybody has
47:13 - all right it looks like
47:24 - all right looks like we're still going
47:25 - with we need to look up the air
47:33 - let's see
47:42 - on first builds okay
47:48 - accessible after a second run
48:06 - all right
48:09 - and mommy said npm cash clear works for
48:11 - me works with no error for me
48:14 - hmm
48:22 - okay
48:24 - that was interesting
48:26 - i want to run this again
48:28 - that
48:28 - the other person there that had that
48:30 - error
48:31 - um
48:37 - oops
48:45 - there we go
48:49 - said when they ran it the second time it
48:51 - worked now we already tried twice in a
48:52 - row so i'm not really
48:54 - hopeful that this will work but it's
48:56 - good shot i mean that's an easy fix if
48:59 - it works
49:00 - you graphical error
49:03 - unknown field
49:21 - well it doesn't look like we're not
49:22 - alone in this
49:24 - but
49:29 - that also means there'll be a lot of
49:30 - stuff we need to go through expect
49:32 - there's a
49:33 - step shooting process
49:37 - the update schema steps should be
49:39 - processed without errors
49:44 - all right that that looks
49:45 - very close to what we have
49:48 - in terms of what the errors
49:52 - directory is clear i'm able to reproduce
49:54 - this and getting it on the first run
49:56 - i'm also seeing this air
49:58 - regardless cash cleared
50:22 - that's
50:28 - not really giving us a solution
50:32 - all right let's go back to the chat see
50:34 - what you all have to
50:39 - all think what you have to say
50:48 - uh think verse says what repo are you
50:50 - using for the fork good question
50:52 - um i'm using
50:56 - so let's grow up so this one so um
50:59 - gwen faraday's
51:01 - um
51:02 - fork
51:03 - of free code camp
51:06 - so it's not directly from free code camp
51:08 - it's it's off of her fork the reason i'm
51:10 - using her fork is because she has um
51:13 - react native lessons on there
51:15 - uh so that's what we need to work with
51:31 - okay
51:33 - fernando says are you missing a module
51:38 - i'm not sure because let's see
51:40 - successful after second run after
51:42 - clearing the cash
51:46 - all right mommy says successful after a
51:48 - second we run after clearing the cash
51:50 - see that's not
51:54 - me i'm so glad you got a success but i'm
51:56 - not getting a success here
51:58 - um
52:00 - so we did clear the cash
52:05 - but we're not getting
52:10 - we're not getting any success here
52:20 - now it is it's possible that there's
52:22 - some difference because of this
52:24 - particular branch on this fork
52:27 - and
52:28 - maybe i just need to talk to gwen and
52:30 - see
52:34 - after second second time after clearing
52:36 - cash i mean i guess we could try to
52:38 - clear
52:40 - try to do a clear again
52:56 - okay
53:18 - okay so this is
53:22 - just the same one
53:27 - keep saying that
53:29 - uh they saw a ghost behind me
53:31 - um
53:33 - as
53:37 - so long as the ghost
53:39 - helps me debug this i'm okay with that
53:42 - um
53:51 - all right yeah this is the one we just
53:53 - turned every time the catastrophe is
53:55 - cleared
54:06 - all right let's clear
54:20 - all right let's clear this
54:29 - and uh me are you using the same
54:33 - fork and branch that i am
54:52 - okay i'm at me saying the cause of the
54:53 - air is gatsby and not graphql that's
54:55 - what i understood don't know
54:58 - all right
55:00 - let's see
55:02 - you know what let's run
55:11 - learner
55:13 - i actually think all that runs
55:22 - so there's definitely a difference so i
55:24 - believe all this stuff with lerna is not
55:26 - present in the main free code camp
55:29 - uh branch
55:32 - and the documentation we're running off
55:34 - of is based off of that
55:36 - maybe that's where the difference is
55:38 - coming in
55:56 - okay
55:59 - the only other thing i can think of is
56:01 - clearing the cache and completely
56:04 - removing
56:05 - um all the node files
56:07 - but it looks like it's
56:09 - remove existing node modules before
56:11 - install so it says it's doing that
56:22 - let's try this out now
56:40 - okay cannot read property minimum level
56:42 - of undefined
56:53 - all right i'm going to take a look at
56:55 - what we're getting here a little bit
56:57 - more closely
57:36 - hmm
57:52 - hmm
58:04 - all right
58:07 - and mimi says you can check can you try
58:09 - using a newer version of gasping graphql
58:12 - john hanson says i recently had a
58:14 - similar issue turned out to be windows
58:15 - 10 path issue i cleaned up path
58:17 - variables and ran a node repair fix it
58:19 - for me oh okay um
58:23 - john could you
58:25 - walk me through that then
58:27 - so this is interesting so uh like i
58:29 - mentioned before i don't normally
58:30 - develop on uh windows so
58:34 - maybe this is some sort of windows thing
58:36 - hammy are you on a pc2
58:48 - i'm also going to run this just one more
58:50 - time since this would be the second time
58:52 - after clearing the cache again which
58:55 - worked before
58:57 - for uh for hammy
59:04 - and
59:06 - i got about three minutes before the
59:08 - next timer goes off and then i'm gonna
59:09 - go back and answer some more questions
59:12 - i'd love to get something running so
59:15 - so far
59:16 - we got
59:18 -  running which we didn't get
59:20 - running last time i don't think so we
59:22 - had one small win
59:35 - all right so that did not work
59:48 - all right so john's saying npm config
59:51 - path prefix
59:54 - should show the path
60:25 - john says open environment variables in
60:29 - windows
60:41 - i'm going to open environment variables
60:43 - i'm going to find this
60:51 - i need to like is there a search on
60:54 - windows
61:01 - where can i search for stuff on windows
61:09 - there we go type here to search
61:20 - [Music]
61:27 - oh it opened on another screen let me
61:28 - move this over
61:30 - all right environment vehicles clearing
61:33 - the castles okay me was on ubuntu okay
61:39 - okay make sure your pass system variable
61:41 - includes your node.js path
61:43 - all right
61:48 - environment variables
62:04 - okay
62:32 - okay
62:42 - include your no jazz path
62:50 - i'm guessing
62:52 - is that would that be the right path i'm
62:54 - showing users jesse app data roaming npm
63:14 - in the path on the system variables
63:17 - oh sorry sorry sorry
63:21 - oh okay
63:22 - let's see what we got here
63:28 - okay
63:34 - all right yeah program files node.js is
63:38 - here
63:49 - should i have something separate for
63:52 - npm
64:14 - all right john says the path looks fine
64:16 - for no jazz
64:17 - so i guess it's not a path thing
64:26 - okay
64:32 - i actually wonder
64:37 - now go to add or remove programs
65:00 - all right
65:15 - all right
65:17 - node this is some some legit debugging
65:20 - here
65:22 - debugging windows
65:24 - um
65:25 - all right
65:28 - all right so we found node
65:30 - and we're gonna run
65:33 - run repair
65:47 - modify
65:48 - and repair
65:51 - repair
65:54 - we're going to repair node
66:02 - i hope this works and it's helpful for
66:04 - somebody out there
66:22 - all right while this is happening i'm
66:24 - gonna
66:24 - [Music]
66:25 - read some questions and stuff
66:27 - oh is it finished already
66:30 - huh
66:31 - i guess i'm not going to read questions
66:32 - as well as
66:35 - john instances you may want to reboot
66:37 - the system
66:40 - all right well i'm not going to reboot
66:42 - in the middle of a stream so i might
66:43 - have to wait until the next stream
66:53 - the only other thing i thought of doing
66:55 - was
66:59 - so i could do
67:02 - yarn develop and see if it does anything
67:05 - different
67:09 - and i know it seems weird but like i
67:11 - have had it happen before that a command
67:14 - will work with yarn but not with npm
67:18 - so it's worth it worth a try
67:26 - it looks like no same thing same air
67:51 - all right i'm gonna do that and i'm also
67:52 - gonna do
68:00 - clean out the node module
68:07 - taking out node modules and the package
68:09 - lock json
68:14 - doing like the legit
68:18 - destroy everything
68:24 - whoa
68:27 - let's see
68:34 - let's try this
68:42 - all right so
68:44 - that'll take a little bit and i can
68:47 - go back to the
68:48 - questions now
69:00 - all right so i'm scrolling all the way
69:02 - up to where i left off
69:03 - so hopefully i don't miss anything
69:13 - georgette says why didn't you continue
69:15 - your last episode react native on
69:16 - browser actually this is a continuation
69:19 - of the last episode
69:20 - um
69:23 - this is kind of the first step in that
69:28 - all right cool that took
69:29 - less time than i thought it would
69:31 - um
69:45 - and
70:00 - start the next
70:12 - oh same error
70:26 - may as well run it twice since
70:30 - since the people on uh
70:35 - on github had success trying to run it
70:37 - twice
70:38 - not really that hopeful at this point
70:40 - though
70:42 - uh
70:46 - i don't think we're gonna get this to
70:48 - work during today's stream
70:50 - which is all right
70:52 - uh it may just be that since we did the
70:55 - repair i just need to restart my
70:56 - computer i'm not going to do that
70:58 - obviously because if i do that it's
70:59 - going to cut the stream off
71:02 - so
71:03 - i'll have to do that
71:04 - after the stream
71:06 - and then hopefully it'll work for the
71:08 - next stream
71:10 - also i'll probably reach out to gwen and
71:13 - ask if there's anything special i need
71:15 - to do
71:16 - um since her project is set up
71:18 - differently so let me
71:21 - i want to show you just so that maybe
71:23 - it's a little bit
71:25 - more clear
71:26 - like how this
71:29 - um
71:33 - what i mean by setup differently
71:35 - right so
71:37 - if we look at
71:39 - like the package json for this
71:41 - and then
71:46 - we go to the normal
71:47 - free code cam master branch and look at
71:50 - the package json
71:54 - let's see if it's
71:56 - looks like there's learning here now
71:57 - maybe i had an older version
72:00 - whoa looks like no dependencies
72:07 - actually there's a lot more going on
72:08 - here now
72:17 - i wonder
72:27 - where's the last time
72:32 - six months
72:50 - all right so the last commit to this was
72:52 - on february 10th
72:54 - about this one
72:57 - january 6.
72:59 - it's possible
73:15 - and the last commit on this was three
73:17 - days ago
73:19 - it's entirely possible
73:22 - that
73:25 - there have been some breaking changes
73:30 - and that's why we can't get it working
73:40 - so
73:42 - i wonder
73:49 - i wonder if it would be a better idea
73:51 - and i don't have time to do it today but
73:53 - um
73:54 - it would be a better idea to try to get
73:57 - free code camp running
74:01 - from like it's its latest updates from
74:04 - the main repo just to get it running
74:07 - then we can pull over like let's say one
74:09 - of the challenges that gwen did as a
74:12 - test
74:13 - to try to get that running because as
74:15 - long as we get it running
74:18 - then
74:19 - gwen can incorporate that into what
74:21 - she's doing and then eventually
74:23 - hopefully that can get put into the free
74:26 - code camp curriculum
74:28 - so
74:29 - everybody can learn
74:31 - some basics of react native
74:37 - i am going to try to do a restart
74:39 - on my machine just to see if i get it
74:41 - working if that doesn't work then i
74:42 - think we're going to go with that plan
74:44 - let me know what you all think about
74:45 - that plan so the the backup plan here is
74:50 - clone
74:52 - so fork and clone the main free code
74:54 - camp repo with the latest changes and
74:56 - try to get it running based on that
74:58 - because that's we're using documentation
75:00 - from the latest repo
75:03 - but we're trying to get something to run
75:05 - that hasn't been updated since february
75:07 - 10th
75:08 - so
75:10 - it's entirely possible that that's part
75:13 - of our issue
75:14 - so the the plan is
75:17 - use the main repo next time if we can't
75:19 - get this one to work let me know what
75:21 - you think of that plan if you have a
75:22 - better plan or if there's something i'm
75:24 - missing here that's like obviously a bad
75:27 - idea
75:44 - uh
75:45 - what exactly is gatsby um gatsby is just
75:50 - a
75:52 - i don't know you would just say like uh
75:54 - a tool or something like
75:56 - um
75:58 - to build sites with
76:00 - um
76:02 - with react
76:04 - um
76:04 - i guess i don't know how to explain it
76:08 - more than than that um
76:11 - from what i understand and i haven't
76:14 - read up on gatsby or tried to use it in
76:16 - a long time but you can use markdown
76:20 - um
76:22 - and then that gets changed into
76:25 - like actual like web pages uh so i think
76:27 - a lot of people use gatsby for for blogs
76:32 - and they can write their stuff in
76:33 - markdown
76:49 - all right and uh i'm not going to read
76:51 - all the comments out i'm just kind of
76:54 - going for the questions now because i'm
76:55 - running out of time here so apologies if
76:57 - i'm not reading out your comment i am
76:59 - looking at them i'm just not reading
77:01 - them out loud
77:07 - uh georgette says what does fork mean uh
77:10 - so a fork is if if you go on github to a
77:14 - repo
77:14 - you can fork the repo and that means
77:17 - that it it just takes everything in this
77:19 - repository and it copies it onto your
77:22 - github account
77:24 - so that you can then work on that code
77:28 - without affecting the main repository
77:31 - so usually if you're going to contribute
77:33 - to a repository the process is fork it
77:36 - first then clone your fork
77:39 - so that you can run it locally and make
77:41 - changes
77:42 - and then if you change your fork you'll
77:44 - have the option of then submitting a
77:46 - pull request to the main repository and
77:49 - whoever controls that repository can
77:51 - decide whether or not they want to merge
77:53 - that pull request which means your code
77:55 - will then become part of their code part
77:57 - of the main repository
77:59 - uh i
78:00 - did
78:03 - check out my youtube channel i believe i
78:05 - did some git and github videos that
78:08 - explain this in more depth so
78:11 - um
78:12 - i guess check that out if you need
78:15 - if you want more info about that
78:19 - i think that i did do
78:21 - i have done some live streams where i've
78:23 - done that whole process before
78:26 - i don't remember what the
78:27 - exactly what the titles of those streams
78:29 - are though
78:33 - uh atse says i want to learn programming
78:35 - from you can you please send me your
78:37 - direct contact number future
78:38 - correspondence um i have some links to
78:41 - my social media stuff in the description
78:44 - uh if you want to send me a dm or
78:46 - something that's cool
78:47 - i'll try to help you out
79:01 - uh yes he says where am i from um i'm
79:03 - from the united states specifically i
79:05 - was born and raised in west virginia
79:09 - which is
79:10 - a
79:11 - part of the united states
79:14 - and right now i live in
79:15 - ohio
79:18 - and i work in pittsburgh pennsylvania in
79:21 - in the united states
79:29 - i had i see a couple questions about
79:31 - like what am i coding what it's going to
79:32 - be if you go back and watch the last
79:35 - stream the last video um so project
79:38 - eight
79:39 - day one i go through all of that of like
79:42 - what i'm building and what we hope to
79:44 - accomplish
80:04 - mimo says basement sleepless dark theme
80:07 - dark room good probability of having no
80:08 - girlfriend
80:10 - or whatsoever this guy is epic hashtag
80:13 - real life programmer well i'm i'm sorry
80:16 - to disappoint you
80:18 - uh but i am married and i have four kids
80:21 - so
80:22 - i i don't fit all of that but i am in a
80:24 - basement
80:26 - uh i do have dark theme everything and
80:29 - i'm in a dark room
80:30 - um
80:32 - the sleep sometimes i get sleep
80:34 - sometimes i don't and it's not really
80:35 - about programming it's more about like
80:37 - which kids wake up
80:46 - uh who's his iphone says are you a gamer
80:50 - by the way i don't know a former gamer i
80:52 - don't have a lot of time for for games
80:54 - right now i do like them i just i don't
80:56 - have a lot of time to play
81:16 - um love your video
81:18 - ryhon says love your videos please make
81:20 - a basic tutorial of complete react.js
81:23 - how to use templates
81:25 - um
81:26 - yeah maybe i'll do some basic react.js
81:28 - stuff
81:29 - at some point
81:32 - usually i put the tutorials on my
81:34 - youtube channel uh links in the
81:36 - description to that
81:37 - because i haven't updated that channel
81:39 - in a little while but i'd like to do
81:41 - another video sometime this week for
81:42 - that channel
81:59 - uh says what's a good way to learn
82:01 - a low-level language
82:04 - i don't really know a good way like for
82:06 - me a good way
82:08 - for me to learn anything is i try to
82:10 - find free resources online do the
82:12 - tutorials watch the videos read the
82:14 - documentation
82:17 - um and then if i really want to learn
82:19 - something actually building a project
82:21 - with it is a great way to learn
82:42 - [Music]
82:47 - uh
82:52 - uh randy keller says what kind of fancy
82:54 - typewriter is that
82:59 - very fancy typewriter here
83:03 - uh i lost my place
83:06 - i don't know why i it just get down
83:09 - it moved my scroll all the way down to
83:11 - the end of the chat and so now i lost my
83:14 - place let me see if i can find it again
83:16 - all right i did
83:17 - um
83:19 - georgia
83:23 - there was a question but i think it was
83:25 - directed at somebody else and not at me
83:37 - um do you prefer python or javascript
83:40 - i prefer javascript because i'm better
83:42 - with it i don't have anything against
83:44 - python i've used it before and i kind of
83:46 - like it but i'm definitely better with
83:48 - javascript
83:55 - now georgette says you should rename the
83:57 - live stream as a series of debugging
83:59 - yeah honestly that's all it's been so
84:01 - far
84:02 - we're gonna actually do something at
84:04 - some point but
84:06 - we gotta get the setup down first
84:09 - um
84:12 - i've always wanted these streams to be
84:13 - like a realistic look at what it's like
84:15 - to be a developer or software engineer
84:17 - and realistically a lot of time is spent
84:20 - debugging like things like this happen
84:22 - so
84:23 - that's why i leave stuff in here i don't
84:25 - edit the streams i don't delete streams
84:28 - like
84:28 - because
84:30 - as as weird as it is to have a live
84:32 - stream like this and not actually get
84:34 - very much done like
84:36 - sometimes that's the way it is when you
84:38 - actually
84:39 - um
84:40 - you know working at a company
85:01 - uh okay so i had mentioned my um
85:13 - all right so uh so i noticed somebody
85:15 - put in a derogatory remark
85:18 - i'm assuming it was meant to be
85:19 - derogatory i don't know but i just
85:21 - deleted it so just as a reminder
85:23 - everybody
85:24 - we try to stay positive here
85:26 - so um
85:28 - and georgette thank you for putting that
85:30 - message in about no negativity here so
85:32 - we stay positive
85:34 - uh if i see anything in the chat like
85:36 - i'm just gonna delete it i'm not gonna
85:38 - argue with anybody like
85:40 - so just
85:42 - you know if that's your thing this
85:43 - really maybe isn't
85:45 - you're not gonna have a good time in
85:47 - here uh if you wanna be negative uh
85:50 - there's enough negativity elsewhere in
85:52 - the world and online so
85:54 - uh but here we try to stay positive so
85:56 - just a reminder to everybody
85:58 - uh you know keep it keep it positive
86:02 - um i mentioned the idea of let's just
86:05 - try to go with the main free code camp
86:06 - branch next time uh john i believe in
86:09 - response that says that sounds like a
86:11 - good idea i got some thumbs up for that
86:14 - so i think
86:16 - that's probably what we'll end up doing
86:26 - uh
86:27 - dts says what are skills required uh for
86:29 - a present web developer
86:31 - i mean the the skills that you need to
86:33 - be able to like learn fast on your own
86:36 - because everything changes so quickly
86:40 - so problem solving skills as well
86:44 - now in terms of like technical skills
86:48 - i mean html css javascript
86:51 - for sure
86:52 - you definitely need that for web
86:53 - development anything else on top of that
86:56 - is really going to depend on what the
86:57 - particular project is you know and what
86:59 - your client or your company uses
87:03 - but if you know html css and javascript
87:05 - you're going to have a good foundation
87:07 - to pick up anything else
87:11 - um dale asks if the stream just started
87:13 - or attending uh it's ending now but you
87:15 - can always watch the recordings the
87:17 - recording will be available
87:28 - sweetie sweetie sweaty ass what are you
87:30 - doing right now right now i'm just
87:31 - answering questions in the live chat
87:41 - uh did the body ask for blockchain
87:43 - tutorials
87:45 - uh i did do some
87:46 - blockchain
87:49 - live streams on my youtube channel so
87:52 - the link to my channel is in the
87:53 - description uh you can check that out
87:56 - it was a while ago but i used um
88:00 - solidity to do some like ethereum
88:03 - uh apps
88:05 - so maybe you know you could check that
88:07 - out i'm no expert at it but if you want
88:08 - to kind of see what it's like just you
88:10 - know check it out
88:21 - all right cool uh so i got through all
88:22 - the questions like i said i did read
88:24 - everything i read all the comments so
88:26 - there's a lot of a lot of people are
88:28 - complimenting uh and i appreciate that
88:31 - thank you so much
88:32 - um i'm gonna wrap this up now and like i
88:34 - said i probably won't stream again until
88:39 - maybe like
88:41 - july

89:43 - yeah so until then
89:45 - have a great next couple of weeks
89:48 - and um yeah thanks again for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to pick up right where we left off last week in the last stream and we're getting free code cam to run locally so when i say free code camp i mean the the lessons the curriculum on freecodecam.org so if you didn't see the last stream here's a quick recap of what we're trying to do we want to make we want to add some react native lessons so gwen faraday has created a react native curriculum and we want to get that running in the browser all right so react native does not run in the browser you know just as is but we can use react native web to make it run in the browser so step one is getting it getting the curriculum to run locally which we started last time so we'll finish that up this time hopefully and we'll get that running so hold on one second all right i forgot to get my music on i usually stream with music in the background because all right can y'all hear me everything cut out for a second i don't know what happened i think i'm back uh all right that was weird there's something with my internet i don't know all right but anyway i like to play music in the background and then that way i i speak a little bit louder otherwise i tend to be kind of a low low kind of speaker so i want to make sure y'all can hear me okay so i'm gonna get some music playing in the background all right i have a lot of stuff in the chat right now so i'm going to check on the chat in about uh 25 minutes or so uh and then oh yeah there's a lot of stuff so i'm just gonna say hey to everybody and then i'm gonna check on the chat about 25 minutes and i also want to let everybody know that i probably won't be streaming next week so probably won't have another stream until the week after so i'm gonna be in chicago at the end of the week for the react loop conference so anybody in chicago um let me know i have a very limited time in chicago i'll be there thursday and then just in the morning on friday and then i'm going to fly back so if i know anybody in chicago and you want to hang out let me know quickly and then maybe we can hang out on thursday and then after that i'm going to come back on friday afternoon and then drive to the beach with my family so i'll be going all week with them and i'm not going to try to stream from the beach okay all right so let's see it's been a week since we worked on this so i need to get up to date on this all right so the last thing that we were working on was trying to get to run locally and that was our that was kind of our challenge right uh also you know let me get a pomodoro clock running and let's do this trying to see where the best place to run this is thought i had one up already but i guess not pomodoro clock is just gonna be like a 25 minute timer okay all right so this is our package json so here these are the uh kind of like the commands that we have we're working with right now see challenges all right so we're going to want to see the challenges but first we actually need to i believe we need to do is get this running so let's check out our let me let me pull over a window here uh browser window i thought i had one going but from the last time i didn't close anything from the last time but you know how it is when you have too many windows open it's easier just open a new one then then define the one you have open all right so we're gonna go to github's free code camp and let's check out the contributing guide uh if you're going to do an open source project sometimes you'll find there's a contributing.md and always make sure you read that you have a much better chance of getting your pull request actually merged if you follow the instructions let's see there we go all right so we've done a lot of this stuff yes we've done this we've done this oh interesting okay so they recommend using docker i do not remember seeing that last time um so they i don't think i have docker installed on this machine so docker is uh like a container system since we already started with the local build stuff i think we'll just go on with that maybe if i have time i'll check out the docker thing and maybe we'll switch to that but for now i think this is probably probably the best way to go okay so we've done this environment variable thing let's see we're not on the docker build okay so that's the docker build we don't want that all above needs to be run only the first time you set up the local dev environment what is ci is let's um i do not believe we ran a ci on npm so let's do that also i believe we found that there's kind of a different structure here um so there's lerna was being used so we might and this is basically on the main branch there's a different structure to the project than on this branch the react native challenges branch so we're going to have to maybe do it a little bit differently so we'll see if we can't get this working we'll see lerna basically um lets you have kind of a structure where you you have um like your main project and a package json at the main level and then you have folders within that that also have their own package jsons and it ties them all together uh i wonder if i can see an example okay so like this is our main package json right and let's see if we have another one here yeah so then we have this this sub package here with its own set of stuff right so that's that's uh lerna is lerna so you could check it out if you want uh i haven't used it for a project but i was considering it for a project that i'm working on hopefully i know enough about it that we can get through this otherwise with to do a little more research all right let's go back to our docs our contributing documentation hey and i think i found the one i was originally looking at okay um on windows let's see we need to start mongodb in a separate terminal okay so let's try to run this i don't remember which one we installed all right let's let's check out our program files mongodb server 3.6 let's see which one we did all right it opened on another window let me just check this out see program files mongodb server all right we have 4.0 okay so we should be able to just copy this and we'll run this in we'll just run this on another little spot another terminal here i believe that was the command let me double check that though mongod that's that's what we wanted i think we had some issues with commands not working so we'll see if this works oops nope that's all not so that's not it uh let's see how did we get that working last time let's see um in the comments it says you can add that path to your environment variables and just run it typing mongod in the terminal oh okay all right that's cool that works um ratted to your environment variables oh or i can cd into that folder and just run it from there you know what that's how we that's how we got it last time thank you brandon so brandon's saying that's where he got stuck last time and that's what i just realized awesome okay so let's let's get that working i'm just gonna cd out of here um let's see if i can get this whoa oops there we go what was it server yeah 4.0 and then i think it was ben after that was that it yeah ben okay there we go now we can run this whoops i just need to run it all right i'm checking i'm checking the memory says i think adding it to the environment was a better choice to avoid cd every time yeah i think you're absolutely right i'm just doing it this way so that we can try to get it started quickly um but yeah you're right i think there's some setup that um that should happen there georgette says it looks like a live stream on how to debug yeah that's pretty much what this ends up being most of the time we actually get stuff done too but um especially when we're starting a project or doing something new it does end up being a lot of debugging all right um let's see so we need to run the dot exe um so let's see okay mommy's giving me the command here so let's go there we go all right cool let's see what happened here i'm gonna go starting on the localhost all right cool so it looks like it worked at me reminding me you're on windows jesse i know i know i normally develop on a mac so uh but i stream from uh pc so uh it's when it there's definitely some differences that i need to get used to so i probably only use a pc i don't know like five percent of the time that i'm on a computer probably less uh so apollo is used for being a little rusty for the pc okay so i think we have this working and so let's see if we can go on to the next step which is i believe seeding the database yep so we'll do npm run seed okay cool that that looks like it's working she completed inserted 200 new articles awesome okay very cool and you should be able to type npm run develop and that'll do everything so i'm hoping that this part is all the same on this uh branch and we'll find out in a second okay i'm just i'm i'm not used to switching between uh windows on a pc on a mac like there's really cool shortcuts to just flip around different like desktops so sorry i'm so slow oh it's doing stuff oh yeah we're using gatsby i forgot if your code camp was built with gatsby all right so we're getting a bunch of messages but nothing that's like oh here we go graphql error challenge us okay so we did actually get an error here hmm interesting all right let's go to our package.json and see if some if it's different all right i believe the seed command is different but i mean not the command just like the the script so the name of the script looks like develops the same interesting let's try oh okay in the chat it looks like a few you're telling me to do alt tab to change the windows let's see oh okay cool and it brings up all my windows awesome it's bringing them up on another screen but like oh that's really cool okay all right let's see so we typed in i'm going to try to force myself to use this alt tab dang it i must not have done it right all right i need to get the hang of this okay so we ran npm run develop but did we ever run yeah we didn't run any type of basically what i'm looking at are these commands here like this this stuff which is um the learner stuff so i think that's what i want to run is this so there's a free bootstrap post install okay let's see all right i'm gonna run some of these i'm not 100 sure that these are what i need to run but let's see i lost my terminals there we go i'm going to cancel wait is that how it works here maybe i could no how am i supposed to get out here there we go it just took a while to kill them all that's such a violent command right to kill the processes could you say like stop them shut them down okay i got about four minutes until i'm gonna go to the chat and answer some questions so if you're if you've been waiting for me to read your comment just hang in there almost there all right so what i want to try to run is this prebootstrap bootstrap and then i guess i can do preboot strap and post install although it seems like it seems like this probably should have run already after we did an npm install but i want to make sure that it it actually ran okay thank you for the uh shortcut for the terminal who did that um so uh so rob sorry if i'm mispronouncing your name but thank you for the the command there okay all right so let's try um npm run what are we gonna do pre bootstrap and this is gonna do the ensure environment okay like i said this stuff may have run already and i just didn't catch it all right now from what i know about learner let's see similar game through shop10 packages all right i kind of think that this stuff ran already and now let's try develop all right so i'm kind of expecting we're gonna get the same thing the same errors we did before but i just wanted to try it out just in case oh now we're getting the same thing this graphql error unknown field challenge node on type query on news article node hmm all right so we're still having those graphql issues we did the seed right we ran the seed command when does this start develop so develop okay so the develop command does run start develop okay and it looks like an ensure environment start to build up okay so this already runs and we ran seed okay i want to see what we ran okay so we did do seeds so that should have seeded challenges and news we do so this command here that this seed and then the little asterisk up here that means it'll run all the commands that have you know seed colon so it should have seeded both okay i think my timer yeah my timer's up i didn't get a notification so unless i just missed it but anyway let's let's go to the questions and then hopefully one of us has some idea where to go next because we keep hitting this graphql error all right i'm going to scroll off to the top try to get through as many questions as i can let's see all right so i have a few people asking me what this is about um i explained it at the beginning uh and then on the last stream that i did i also explained a lot more so i'm gonna just say like refer back to the beginning uh gabriel says what is what is the code camp all about um free code camp is a nonprofit organization that helps people learn how to code for free it has a lot of things so it has the the lessons on freecodecamp.org that are like two coding tutorials um it has a bunch of uh blog posts a youtube channel a podcast a whole like wiki site uh a forum so i'm probably missing out on stuff but there's just a ton of resources for people to learn how to code all of it is completely free okay there's a ton of stuff in the chat so i'm trying to scroll through quickly apologies if i miss your question rusty asks what language is it we're going to be using javascript let's see all right uh georgette says hey jesse do you think you can create a series in which you create an app with react native so actually the the last project that we worked on that we're not finished yet is a react native app so we're gonna go back to that once we get done with this uh so that'll be project seven so you can go back and look at all the project seven videos on free code camp uh just just my videos the live coding with jesse stuff to get an idea of how you would do a react native app uh prince the boss says do you use pomodoro to get yourself into the flow state when you start yes i do try to use pomodoro when i can at my my normal job so i'm a software engineer at dick's sporting goods we do a lot of pair programming it's kind of harder to get in the flow state when you pay a program but when i can i do try to get in that flow state and i do use pomodoro technique but it's not always possible when you're pair programming meltdown is asking for a shout out hey meltdown uh gregory says wondering is there any free code campers in georgia hey any free code campers in georgia give a shout in the chat or in the comments uh let's see uh ready and says can i fork yeah yeah for sure you can fork this repo um anybody can contribute to the free code camp repo it's not like uh um there's no prerequisites or anything well i guess you have to be smart enough to get it running which evidently i'm not there yet but i'm gonna get there and then he says hello jesse how are you doing uh hey i'm guess i'm doing all right um pretty busy this week getting ready for the conference and um uh for vacation and everything but other than that i'm doing all right thanks for asking uh goulet says do you have save recordings of your teaching javascript and html uh yeah so all my live streams are recorded and they're saved on here on the free code camp channel just search for live coding with jesse or check out the sorry check out the live coding with jesse playlist you can also check out my youtube channel the links in the description i have some tutorial videos there and also some live streams there and i'm gonna try to put out a video before i go on go to my conference or before i go to vacation on vacation um this next week um so i haven't decided exactly what the topic will be but i'd like to do another kind of short tutorial video since i haven't done one for a while okay i didn't get through everything so i'm going to mark down the time stamp where i left off so i can go right back to it he says i think if you empty your cash and try again the arrow will go okay um let's see all right that's where the shot should you empty how am i supposed to empty my cash remember this is a silly question but um let me know i'm not sure uh who's who's scifi says looks like you're really tired i'm tired it's it's uh it's not that early here it's 7 42 a.m um so it's not super early but i am a little tired okay um somebody asked me how many people are watching right now that's a good question i didn't really check uh 123 people right now so that's kind of cool that's that's a decent amount of people all right lettuces do a clean build all right let's get this out of here we don't need to see all right i'm gonna hide this on the side just for a second here because we don't really need it also going to give us some more space here okay everybody keep getting comments about why is it so dark down here it's dark right now because well number one it's it's dark outside because it's raining yes it's very cloudy i'm also in a basement so it's pretty it's pretty dark and um i just left the lights off because there's less glare on the screen it's okay all right so i guess we could try oops oh i know what i wanted to do um so we are running on a on a fork on a different branch so it may be that there are different instructions so let's go we go so we're gonna go to gwen faraday's uh repo and we're gonna there we go we're gonna go to her branch and see if nah i don't think so i was hoping that there are updates to the contributing file but i don't think there is actually we would want this file right set up free code camp locally i'm just trying to see if there's a difference here or i don't think there is no definitely not okay i probably should just open the local host just to yeah just to verify that it's not going to run oh okay so we got some more so hammy says um that's what i found on github's gatsby page the error was found before you can search for the error message on google and you'll find the steps okay cool thanks so much so let's just google that error um i'm not sure which which era i'm gonna feel let's just grab this one all right well let me see we could try npm cash clean whoa okay so feels encryption shoes interesting all right i can force this command if i want to just do that i love it you're using force i sure hope you know what you're doing all right cool and i believe the command that they said was all right so let's try that also let's look up i want to go back to the free code cam thing and i want to try to look up this error uh yeah i didn't think that this error would come up specifically usb issues all right yeah this was like this same error no yeah i don't think that's it all right cool so let's try this now develop that's it oops i'm used to using yarn and you don't have to type run with that hmm okay same thing let's see i'm checking the chat here to see what advice everybody has all right it looks like all right looks like we're still going with we need to look up the air let's see on first builds okay accessible after a second run all right and mommy said npm cash clear works for me works with no error for me hmm okay that was interesting i want to run this again that the other person there that had that error um oops there we go said when they ran it the second time it worked now we already tried twice in a row so i'm not really hopeful that this will work but it's good shot i mean that's an easy fix if it works you graphical error unknown field well it doesn't look like we're not alone in this but that also means there'll be a lot of stuff we need to go through expect there's a step shooting process the update schema steps should be processed without errors all right that that looks very close to what we have in terms of what the errors directory is clear i'm able to reproduce this and getting it on the first run i'm also seeing this air regardless cash cleared that's not really giving us a solution all right let's go back to the chat see what you all have to all think what you have to say uh think verse says what repo are you using for the fork good question um i'm using so let's grow up so this one so um gwen faraday's um fork of free code camp so it's not directly from free code camp it's it's off of her fork the reason i'm using her fork is because she has um react native lessons on there uh so that's what we need to work with okay fernando says are you missing a module i'm not sure because let's see successful after second run after clearing the cash all right mommy says successful after a second we run after clearing the cash see that's not me i'm so glad you got a success but i'm not getting a success here um so we did clear the cash but we're not getting we're not getting any success here now it is it's possible that there's some difference because of this particular branch on this fork and maybe i just need to talk to gwen and see after second second time after clearing cash i mean i guess we could try to clear try to do a clear again okay okay so this is just the same one keep saying that uh they saw a ghost behind me um as so long as the ghost helps me debug this i'm okay with that um all right yeah this is the one we just turned every time the catastrophe is cleared all right let's clear all right let's clear this and uh me are you using the same fork and branch that i am okay i'm at me saying the cause of the air is gatsby and not graphql that's what i understood don't know all right let's see you know what let's run learner i actually think all that runs so there's definitely a difference so i believe all this stuff with lerna is not present in the main free code camp uh branch and the documentation we're running off of is based off of that maybe that's where the difference is coming in okay the only other thing i can think of is clearing the cache and completely removing um all the node files but it looks like it's remove existing node modules before install so it says it's doing that let's try this out now okay cannot read property minimum level of undefined all right i'm going to take a look at what we're getting here a little bit more closely hmm hmm all right and mimi says you can check can you try using a newer version of gasping graphql john hanson says i recently had a similar issue turned out to be windows 10 path issue i cleaned up path variables and ran a node repair fix it for me oh okay um john could you walk me through that then so this is interesting so uh like i mentioned before i don't normally develop on uh windows so maybe this is some sort of windows thing hammy are you on a pc2 i'm also going to run this just one more time since this would be the second time after clearing the cache again which worked before for uh for hammy and i got about three minutes before the next timer goes off and then i'm gonna go back and answer some more questions i'd love to get something running so so far we got running which we didn't get running last time i don't think so we had one small win all right so that did not work all right so john's saying npm config path prefix should show the path john says open environment variables in windows i'm going to open environment variables i'm going to find this i need to like is there a search on windows where can i search for stuff on windows there we go type here to search oh it opened on another screen let me move this over all right environment vehicles clearing the castles okay me was on ubuntu okay okay make sure your pass system variable includes your node.js path all right environment variables okay okay include your no jazz path i'm guessing is that would that be the right path i'm showing users jesse app data roaming npm in the path on the system variables oh sorry sorry sorry oh okay let's see what we got here okay all right yeah program files node.js is here should i have something separate for npm all right john says the path looks fine for no jazz so i guess it's not a path thing okay i actually wonder now go to add or remove programs all right all right node this is some some legit debugging here debugging windows um all right all right so we found node and we're gonna run run repair modify and repair repair we're going to repair node i hope this works and it's helpful for somebody out there all right while this is happening i'm gonna read some questions and stuff oh is it finished already huh i guess i'm not going to read questions as well as john instances you may want to reboot the system all right well i'm not going to reboot in the middle of a stream so i might have to wait until the next stream the only other thing i thought of doing was so i could do yarn develop and see if it does anything different and i know it seems weird but like i have had it happen before that a command will work with yarn but not with npm so it's worth it worth a try it looks like no same thing same air all right i'm gonna do that and i'm also gonna do clean out the node module taking out node modules and the package lock json doing like the legit destroy everything whoa let's see let's try this all right so that'll take a little bit and i can go back to the questions now all right so i'm scrolling all the way up to where i left off so hopefully i don't miss anything georgette says why didn't you continue your last episode react native on browser actually this is a continuation of the last episode um this is kind of the first step in that all right cool that took less time than i thought it would um and start the next oh same error may as well run it twice since since the people on uh on github had success trying to run it twice not really that hopeful at this point though uh i don't think we're gonna get this to work during today's stream which is all right uh it may just be that since we did the repair i just need to restart my computer i'm not going to do that obviously because if i do that it's going to cut the stream off so i'll have to do that after the stream and then hopefully it'll work for the next stream also i'll probably reach out to gwen and ask if there's anything special i need to do um since her project is set up differently so let me i want to show you just so that maybe it's a little bit more clear like how this um what i mean by setup differently right so if we look at like the package json for this and then we go to the normal free code cam master branch and look at the package json let's see if it's looks like there's learning here now maybe i had an older version whoa looks like no dependencies actually there's a lot more going on here now i wonder where's the last time six months all right so the last commit to this was on february 10th about this one january 6. it's possible and the last commit on this was three days ago it's entirely possible that there have been some breaking changes and that's why we can't get it working so i wonder i wonder if it would be a better idea and i don't have time to do it today but um it would be a better idea to try to get free code camp running from like it's its latest updates from the main repo just to get it running then we can pull over like let's say one of the challenges that gwen did as a test to try to get that running because as long as we get it running then gwen can incorporate that into what she's doing and then eventually hopefully that can get put into the free code camp curriculum so everybody can learn some basics of react native i am going to try to do a restart on my machine just to see if i get it working if that doesn't work then i think we're going to go with that plan let me know what you all think about that plan so the the backup plan here is clone so fork and clone the main free code camp repo with the latest changes and try to get it running based on that because that's we're using documentation from the latest repo but we're trying to get something to run that hasn't been updated since february 10th so it's entirely possible that that's part of our issue so the the plan is use the main repo next time if we can't get this one to work let me know what you think of that plan if you have a better plan or if there's something i'm missing here that's like obviously a bad idea uh what exactly is gatsby um gatsby is just a i don't know you would just say like uh a tool or something like um to build sites with um with react um i guess i don't know how to explain it more than than that um from what i understand and i haven't read up on gatsby or tried to use it in a long time but you can use markdown um and then that gets changed into like actual like web pages uh so i think a lot of people use gatsby for for blogs and they can write their stuff in markdown all right and uh i'm not going to read all the comments out i'm just kind of going for the questions now because i'm running out of time here so apologies if i'm not reading out your comment i am looking at them i'm just not reading them out loud uh georgette says what does fork mean uh so a fork is if if you go on github to a repo you can fork the repo and that means that it it just takes everything in this repository and it copies it onto your github account so that you can then work on that code without affecting the main repository so usually if you're going to contribute to a repository the process is fork it first then clone your fork so that you can run it locally and make changes and then if you change your fork you'll have the option of then submitting a pull request to the main repository and whoever controls that repository can decide whether or not they want to merge that pull request which means your code will then become part of their code part of the main repository uh i did check out my youtube channel i believe i did some git and github videos that explain this in more depth so um i guess check that out if you need if you want more info about that i think that i did do i have done some live streams where i've done that whole process before i don't remember what the exactly what the titles of those streams are though uh atse says i want to learn programming from you can you please send me your direct contact number future correspondence um i have some links to my social media stuff in the description uh if you want to send me a dm or something that's cool i'll try to help you out uh yes he says where am i from um i'm from the united states specifically i was born and raised in west virginia which is a part of the united states and right now i live in ohio and i work in pittsburgh pennsylvania in in the united states i had i see a couple questions about like what am i coding what it's going to be if you go back and watch the last stream the last video um so project eight day one i go through all of that of like what i'm building and what we hope to accomplish mimo says basement sleepless dark theme dark room good probability of having no girlfriend or whatsoever this guy is epic hashtag real life programmer well i'm i'm sorry to disappoint you uh but i am married and i have four kids so i i don't fit all of that but i am in a basement uh i do have dark theme everything and i'm in a dark room um the sleep sometimes i get sleep sometimes i don't and it's not really about programming it's more about like which kids wake up uh who's his iphone says are you a gamer by the way i don't know a former gamer i don't have a lot of time for for games right now i do like them i just i don't have a lot of time to play um love your video ryhon says love your videos please make a basic tutorial of complete react.js how to use templates um yeah maybe i'll do some basic react.js stuff at some point usually i put the tutorials on my youtube channel uh links in the description to that because i haven't updated that channel in a little while but i'd like to do another video sometime this week for that channel uh says what's a good way to learn a lowlevel language i don't really know a good way like for me a good way for me to learn anything is i try to find free resources online do the tutorials watch the videos read the documentation um and then if i really want to learn something actually building a project with it is a great way to learn uh uh randy keller says what kind of fancy typewriter is that very fancy typewriter here uh i lost my place i don't know why i it just get down it moved my scroll all the way down to the end of the chat and so now i lost my place let me see if i can find it again all right i did um georgia there was a question but i think it was directed at somebody else and not at me um do you prefer python or javascript i prefer javascript because i'm better with it i don't have anything against python i've used it before and i kind of like it but i'm definitely better with javascript now georgette says you should rename the live stream as a series of debugging yeah honestly that's all it's been so far we're gonna actually do something at some point but we gotta get the setup down first um i've always wanted these streams to be like a realistic look at what it's like to be a developer or software engineer and realistically a lot of time is spent debugging like things like this happen so that's why i leave stuff in here i don't edit the streams i don't delete streams like because as as weird as it is to have a live stream like this and not actually get very much done like sometimes that's the way it is when you actually um you know working at a company uh okay so i had mentioned my um all right so uh so i noticed somebody put in a derogatory remark i'm assuming it was meant to be derogatory i don't know but i just deleted it so just as a reminder everybody we try to stay positive here so um and georgette thank you for putting that message in about no negativity here so we stay positive uh if i see anything in the chat like i'm just gonna delete it i'm not gonna argue with anybody like so just you know if that's your thing this really maybe isn't you're not gonna have a good time in here uh if you wanna be negative uh there's enough negativity elsewhere in the world and online so uh but here we try to stay positive so just a reminder to everybody uh you know keep it keep it positive um i mentioned the idea of let's just try to go with the main free code camp branch next time uh john i believe in response that says that sounds like a good idea i got some thumbs up for that so i think that's probably what we'll end up doing uh dts says what are skills required uh for a present web developer i mean the the skills that you need to be able to like learn fast on your own because everything changes so quickly so problem solving skills as well now in terms of like technical skills i mean html css javascript for sure you definitely need that for web development anything else on top of that is really going to depend on what the particular project is you know and what your client or your company uses but if you know html css and javascript you're going to have a good foundation to pick up anything else um dale asks if the stream just started or attending uh it's ending now but you can always watch the recordings the recording will be available sweetie sweetie sweaty ass what are you doing right now right now i'm just answering questions in the live chat uh did the body ask for blockchain tutorials uh i did do some blockchain live streams on my youtube channel so the link to my channel is in the description uh you can check that out it was a while ago but i used um solidity to do some like ethereum uh apps so maybe you know you could check that out i'm no expert at it but if you want to kind of see what it's like just you know check it out all right cool uh so i got through all the questions like i said i did read everything i read all the comments so there's a lot of a lot of people are complimenting uh and i appreciate that thank you so much um i'm gonna wrap this up now and like i said i probably won't stream again until maybe like july or maybe the very end of of june because i got conferences and vacation coming up but i'll be on social media so if you want to talk to me there i'll definitely be there i'm on twitter and instagram a lot and i'm going to try to put out a video on my youtube channel this week as well so if you if you want to talk to me go ahead again i'm going to be in chicago at the end of the week so if i know anybody in chicago reach out to me uh maybe we can hang out get some coffee or something on thursday thursday will probably be the only day i'll be able to hang out of this week uh all right so thanks everybody uh it was a good show i had fun in this stream it was good i mean it's we found didn't really fix what we were trying to fix uh but that's the way it goes sometimes so we got a good plan for next time i'm excited about that i think we will get it to work next time and uh yeah so until then have a great next couple of weeks and um yeah thanks again for watching
