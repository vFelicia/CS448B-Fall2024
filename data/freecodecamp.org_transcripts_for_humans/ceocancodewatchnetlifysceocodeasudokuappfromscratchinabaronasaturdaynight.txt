With timestamps:

00:00 - in addition to everyone who's building
00:01 - things here over the course of a couple
00:03 - of days
00:04 - we asked Matt if you'd build us
00:05 - something in an hour which that was that
00:07 - was a nice surprise right let's just say
00:10 - it was a surprise it was a surprise okay
00:12 - the nice part we'll wait and see and so
00:14 - we're gonna give that a try now we'll
00:16 - we'll see how we get on and we've got an
00:18 - hour to see you know what the process is
00:21 - what you dig through we'll we'll work
00:23 - through it together yeah it'll show up
00:26 - your your typing and talking skills well
00:30 - an hour of me cooling stackoverflow and
00:33 - making typos pretty much I did cheat a
00:36 - little and spent some time today
00:38 - prototyping what I'm gonna be working on
00:41 - just so so I'm not gonna stumbling
00:43 - around completely blind okay but I
00:46 - didn't let's let's see how it goes and
00:49 - if I still remember how to write code in
00:51 - between your Co II okay so in should we
00:56 - move so first of all can we can we show
00:57 - map screen we are we showing map screen
00:59 - at the moment yeah okay great so now
01:02 - there's no escape now Matt there's left
01:06 - so so if you're watching my screen
01:08 - you'll see that I'm doing this a little
01:11 - boilerplate that we made a little if I
01:13 - comb to create react Atlanta and
01:17 - basically it I think by now pretty much
01:19 - the far majority of people watching this
01:22 - dream will probably know create react
01:24 - app as being sort of their the really
01:26 - common starting points when you react
01:28 - applications in and I really this just
01:32 - gives me will see if I even get so far
01:34 - but this gives me the ability to write
01:36 - some server-side code during during
01:38 - during this stream okay in and I think
01:42 - it's just one of these things that I
01:43 - also talked about earlier in the live
01:45 - stream in how how how great it is to
01:48 - just start getting a basic flow setup
01:52 - before we actually start building our
01:54 - our app then that supports what we are
01:57 - going to build right now so in terms of
01:59 - what we're going to build the next thing
02:02 - I've given some thought to write in what
02:06 - do we call it in got any good name
02:09 - suggestions for super cool challenge
02:12 - yeah yeah that's not so come on
02:17 - [Music]
02:19 - Sudoku stack velcro stack okay okay so
02:23 - that's gonna be in the Louisville I get
02:25 - in the new repo in so basically what
02:29 - this deploy button does is that it sets
02:31 - up a new repo and there's an initial
02:33 - deploy of create react app and make sure
02:36 - I just have like a complete continuous
02:38 - deployment process to true globally
02:40 - distributed network and and they you
02:43 - know me a slammed the integration and
02:44 - all of that stuff and basically what
02:46 - what what I thought would be really fun
02:48 - to do for sort of an hour-long challenge
02:50 - is that back about ten years ago in when
02:56 - I had moved to Spain from been mark and
02:58 - and I was still at the time working as a
03:00 - music journalist in Denmark and and was
03:03 - starting to figure out that I was gonna
03:04 - stay in Spain and that there wasn't a
03:06 - lot of work in working as a writer
03:10 - covering music in Danish especially not
03:14 - when it was like contemporary classical
03:16 - music and and weird yes
03:17 - in Danish in Spain yeah yeah I liked it
03:20 - it was a surprise at the time but but it
03:23 - turned out that it just wasn't that high
03:25 - demand in something's wrong with the
03:28 - world but but that's how it was right in
03:30 - okay but back then I want one of the
03:34 - things I just started building or soon
03:36 - was was this is pseudocode challenge and
03:40 - so I built this challenge where you
03:42 - could like go to a webpage you could get
03:44 - us sued aku you could solve it on time
03:46 - and then you could send the mail to a
03:48 - friend with the same Sudoku and and
03:51 - challenge that person to like see if you
03:53 - can beat my time but in fact then that
03:56 - was like a pretty big project actually
04:00 - if it was back in in the early days of
04:03 - rails right and and everything was if
04:09 - everything was was server-side and so on
04:12 - when rails app wasn't it wasn't the easy
04:14 - right and just just the whole story
04:16 - around like the browser and JavaScript
04:18 - was really different years ago right so
04:21 - so even just the concept of like okay
04:23 - how how am I gonna me
04:25 - and interactive UI for Sudoku singing in
04:28 - a browser it was much more peach based
04:31 - of like having all these forms and
04:33 - sending it to a rails controller and
04:35 - rendering it response and so on and of
04:37 - course all all the pseudocode generation
04:40 - in I I had to come up with a way to do
04:43 - through this I found this old repository
04:45 - I made back then like 10 years ago right
04:47 - this is the one to say original so this
04:49 - is this is an a version of it that I
04:51 - wrote in Group E so one of the things
04:53 - that was a constraint back then was that
04:54 - this had to run on my server during the
04:57 - redwood quest and and service are
04:59 - smaller back then and ruby is kind of
05:00 - sad and deployments were really hot yeah
05:03 - so I actually also rewrote this and see
05:05 - that's a ruby extension just to get the
05:08 - performance for for generating these
05:10 - these rubies so this is like a DLX based
05:13 - on but it's like based on an old day in
05:15 - computer science paper by Donald Knuth
05:18 - around an algorithm called dancing links
05:20 - in that really like if someone wants
05:23 - like some mind-bending fun go and read
05:26 - that paper image and and do the logic
05:28 - and and see why it's called dancing
05:30 - links and visualizer and a lot of fun
05:31 - but like again one of these things
05:34 - that's that's changed now right from
05:36 - from back when I when I had to do it
05:38 - that way yeah it said today we can maybe
05:40 - just go on NPM and then we do with like
05:42 - pseudo coup and we get like oh there's
05:45 - like NPM gaya / pseudo code that's a
05:48 - relief because I was worried yeah and
05:49 - it's been the next our hindrance anyway
05:57 - right but now I can just like NPM pseudo
06:00 - cool makes Indonesia yeah it's a little
06:03 - like kidding but that's that's the
06:05 - resources we have medicine that's what
06:07 - it's all about now right like so so what
06:09 - have you been to while you were talking
06:10 - you yeah you do so basically I set up my
06:14 - locale devera development environment by
06:16 - like what what what net if I did for me
06:18 - was setting up like this new website it
06:21 - has its own URL if anybody deployed if
06:24 - anyone is fast enough to capture this
06:26 - URL from the lime stream you can go
06:28 - there and follow along
06:30 - it's a dist yeah and it also created a
06:34 - new repository so again if anyone
06:38 - goes to kill men in its the other test
06:41 - is spelling my name right and then dr.
06:44 - stack you you can actually find the the
06:46 - source code I'm working this is what
06:49 - this is yeah this is what was cloned and
06:52 - then I just downloaded it and ran a yawn
06:55 - to to install all of the internet
06:59 - locally right and and Yanis even it's
07:02 - nicer than npm in that it actually since
07:04 - i practiced this a little before it
07:06 - realized that and it seems really
07:10 - surprised how fast it was nice
07:12 - so by this stage then you've already got
07:14 - your continuous integration setup got a
07:16 - site yes configured on that the fire
07:18 - that's watching a repository and you
07:20 - also download clone that repository
07:22 - locally so you've got a local
07:23 - environment CI environment
07:26 - yep city everything right and and i can
07:28 - here in the local repository I just did
07:32 - a yawn yawn at pseudo cool right like so
07:34 - that was what took me like it back ten
07:37 - years ago then I spent like a month
07:39 - implementing tunnel clearance dancing
07:41 - links and everything and transpiling it
07:43 - to see and now I just died young at do
07:46 - you really you realize that this was
07:47 - around 10 years ago though Matt do you
07:48 - not realise this and then I just ran
08:01 - yawn stat right and that's again one of
08:03 - these awesome things that that that now
08:06 - as soon as this whole server spins up
08:09 - and gets done building the initial build
08:11 - plane I just have this awesome
08:13 - Google local environment and we can
08:15 - start hacking away right in so this this
08:18 - demo obviously has little craft that we
08:19 - don't really need don't need some big
08:21 - react local do show pseudo code
08:23 - challenges I don't need a lamp that
08:25 - anymore let's get rid of this logo let's
08:29 - say having each one because I like
08:32 - having an each one on a pink bra though
08:36 - getting cheerleading from the plain old
08:42 - dog who stick here we go
08:45 - bang cool so we're spinning we have a
08:49 - name I think we'll need
08:50 - the header to be a little smaller it has
08:53 - like some big viewport wildenstein let's
08:58 - just get rid of that and do like a
08:59 - padding no fear I'm kind of interested
09:03 - to see that very quickly you're starting
09:05 - to work on the design of this as well
09:08 - I'm very much like instant gratification
09:11 - how can we best get something quickly
09:13 - that has something it's like totally him
09:16 - and especially when I'm trying to turn
09:19 - our project you'll also see me there's a
09:23 - bunch of stuff I would do differently
09:24 - from it for me like your project I had
09:26 - more time don't really think about like
09:28 - hey maybe I should use typescript right
09:30 - totally look into how hooks works to do
09:33 - things that way yes there's a bunch of
09:36 - stuff right but but when you I'd like a
09:38 - hackathon and you want to actually build
09:40 - something then I just find it it's
09:42 - really good to just rely and stuff
09:43 - you've done
09:44 - yeah build with what you know discovery
09:48 - no and and and split your time a bit
09:50 - between the time that's like hey now I'm
09:52 - learning new tools and experiencing and
09:54 - now I'm actually trying to get something
09:57 - was working right don't get it get it
09:59 - get it out there right source solace
10:00 - right now I'm very much and get
10:02 - something working mode right so the
10:04 - first thing I'll need to get anything
10:06 - working is to figure out how how the
10:07 - hell does this thing work and they it
10:11 - apparently has to make puzzles right but
10:13 - we need to sort of figure out what what
10:14 - does that make puzzle version do one of
10:17 - the things that I love in coding is the
10:19 - a very ripple idea I'm right like the
10:21 - runt run to run eval print loop there's
10:24 - this sort of brought forth and the
10:27 - browser to date this comes with an
10:28 - awesome one of those so my first aid
10:32 - really ugly dirty hack to get a little
10:34 - bit of it will be to import this
10:36 - generator from pseudo cool and then
10:40 - instead of using it for anything else
10:41 - you say like this is this is nothing
10:44 - don't try this at all I'll just expose
10:48 - it on the window update
10:52 - let's make a puzzle here we go Oh yummy
10:56 - ruin running right in so this was one
10:58 - thing that when I was / diving earlier
11:00 - it it it couldn't like it took me a
11:02 - while to figure this out and not be
11:04 - really really confused by it so it just
11:07 - to recap like a pseudo coup it's always
11:10 - like it's this grid like typically nine
11:12 - by nine right and then each row has to
11:15 - have all the numbers 1 to 9
11:17 - each a column has to have all the
11:20 - numbers 1 to 9 and each square that's
11:22 - nine by nine has to has all the numbers
11:24 - 99 right in and if if we look and again
11:28 - this took me a while to reach I noticed
11:30 - right but if we look at what this
11:31 - specific NPM module outputs
11:34 - there's only zeros in here right so for
11:37 - some reason the author of this generator
11:39 - decided it was nice to have the number
11:41 - zero to eight instead of one to nine
11:45 - interesting choice for them now that I
11:48 - know it I won't spend a lot of time
11:50 - being very perplexed and on a couple of
11:52 - things to discover that is a good thing
11:55 - to just go before him right but now the
11:57 - next time I make the next thing like one
12:00 - of the things that I learned a lot from
12:01 - as a developer was working with Haskell
12:04 - for a while Haskell has this very strong
12:06 - type system and it's all about
12:08 - transformations of the types right in
12:11 - and in the beginning I was fighting a
12:13 - lot with that today I would really like
12:15 - that obviously I didn't pick typescript
12:18 - than anything so I'm not going to do
12:19 - anything that really deals with types
12:20 - but I am gonna start from thinking okay
12:23 - how do I want data to flow down through
12:26 - this application right so I know that
12:28 - I'll end up with with like an app that
12:31 - has some kind of pseudo keyboard and
12:32 - that board has some grows and those rows
12:35 - has some fields in them that that has a
12:38 - number that's either a read-only number
12:40 - that came from the from the puzzle or a
12:44 - non read-only number that that came from
12:46 - the user right so I want to think off
12:48 - the bed okay how can i how can I take
12:51 - this and generate something that that
12:53 - that comes with a data structure there
12:56 - dim in that that I can work really well
13:02 - with
13:03 - and how can I write right like
13:05 - JavaScript that activity is JavaScript
13:07 - it's another question right so I'll
13:10 - start by just generating the raw in
13:13 - pseudo Kuen I've just seen in my little
13:15 - rate ripple that in meek puzzle seems
13:19 - just do that job right
13:21 - so all that gives me is just like this
13:23 - long array of no structure whatsoever
13:27 - right like that's not really what I want
13:28 - to work with in I want to work with him
13:31 - just like now that I don't have added
13:35 - anything with the type system I can at
13:37 - least like document a little I like the
13:41 - attention to detail that's going on here
13:43 - okay I'm assuming that's cuz you're
13:45 - scared of tripping yourself up later
13:48 - yeah yeah and it's because I think that
13:50 - this is so fundamental like just
13:51 - thinking about the right data structures
13:53 - really really helps oh so what I'm
13:55 - thinking is that I'll have an array of
13:57 - rows and if there's Haskell is result
14:00 - all be types and stuff just like weird
14:02 - objects right like if it was typescript
14:04 - I might even turn it into two classes
14:06 - right so each of these so so probably
14:09 - I'll have like actually a base object
14:10 - that has some rows and each of those
14:14 - rows will be an object that has some
14:16 - columns I guess and then each of those
14:19 - columns in this Chris one thing I
14:23 - quickly found out I want to have it like
14:24 - the row ID and the column ID so we know
14:28 - what we're working on
14:29 - I wanted to have the actual value
14:31 - whatever it is right and then I want it
14:34 - and then then I want like a read-only
14:36 - property in that that tells us like is
14:40 - this a prefilled value that the youth
14:42 - like that they that can't be changed or
14:44 - is it something that can't be changed
14:45 - right so so this is probably an okay
14:49 - start for like the the the data
14:51 - structure it gives me four for each I I
14:54 - would actually add one thing I would add
14:56 - also here an index that just gives me a
14:59 - key because I know in later on when I'm
15:02 - building out this this UI tree which is
15:06 - really the way you should think about
15:07 - react right like you have like a root
15:10 - element and then you have data just
15:11 - flowing down you know through a three of
15:13 - components right I just know that I'm
15:16 - gonna
15:17 - he's for each rose that states the same
15:19 - for efficiency and so on right yeah so I
15:22 - know this is kind of like the initial
15:24 - data structure I want to come up with
15:26 - and then I could do like normally I'll
15:28 - do all kinds of fancy functional maps
15:31 - and so on but let's do something really
15:33 - basic and say okay so we want some
15:37 - result in that has some rows etc here
15:41 - and then for just to completely zero to
15:56 - nine right in one thing that can be a
16:06 - little confusing with with es6 is that
16:08 - kant's doesn't really mean that
16:09 - something is frozen in it it just means
16:13 - that it means that I can't reassign this
16:20 - variable but I can still mutate the
16:22 - object I didn't know that I might choose
16:28 - to use too late but I think my limbs are
16:29 - sending is right now welcome
16:37 - you know so we have this nine times nine
16:41 - you read right that we're just gonna use
16:43 - the very basic ing variable yes yeah
16:47 - right and the world friends and then
16:51 - this column is gonna be something that
16:54 - has like the role yeah
16:59 - generate and then the value will
17:02 - actually I think I like strike the value
17:05 - out here because clear well be the wrong
17:10 - one and then if I'm right it will be
17:12 - like I times nine to sort of navigate it
17:16 - in there rewrite like doing doing doing
17:18 - okay yes yes plus gay right if I'm right
17:22 - this is a team right to you thank you if
17:26 - we say if we have this if we take our
17:31 - little rebel or I did you play around
17:33 - right so if we have raw and we say okay
17:37 - we have the first column in the first
17:38 - one yeah like 0 times nine plus zero
17:42 - right like they will give us the first
17:44 - value yeah then let's see one two three
17:47 - four five six seven eight nine
17:52 - so if we had like still the first row
17:55 - and nine off that didn't get right
18:07 - actually okay yeah actually yeah because
18:12 - we're going from ceará Tory yes that's
18:14 - good right and then if we have the
18:16 - second element and the next row that
18:19 - would be something like this I know
18:22 - something like this you know before okay
18:24 - so it seems to increase reading
18:26 - interesting in I'll say this looks good
18:30 - and then read only right now it's
18:32 - actually as simple as if the value is
18:36 - not know exactly then it's a prefilled
18:41 - field setting this in the moments got
18:43 - you yeah so yeah and then at the end of
18:47 - this to make it useful we should
18:48 - probably return something
18:50 - oops okay
18:54 - in we have a problem still we should
18:58 - actually do something with this problem
19:01 - in
19:02 - [Music]
19:13 - okay here we go let's see okay
19:18 - complaints like we're not getting
19:19 - actually using this right makes sense
19:21 - because we're not using it so let's
19:25 - start by just this I know this like a
19:28 - more fencing yours it takes for this now
19:30 - but again
19:31 - Agathon do what you do a computer with
19:35 - confidence first and and don't worry in
19:39 - so let's say we set the stage and we
19:43 - just sit this rule to generate pseudo
19:46 - cool and now we have some state okay
19:51 - okay
19:51 - next job let's actually displace
19:54 - something yeah that would be lovely
19:55 - I always have is always a nice moment
19:56 - when something appears on the screen
19:58 - yeah so let's see let's create a suit so
20:09 - cool for yes him I'll do that by let's
20:12 - create a component folder in and add a
20:17 - pseudo COO board there and just get this
20:23 - boilerplate in there
20:34 - okay and then let's let's start with
20:38 - fair really yeah with the most basic
20:41 - proof of concept there would be
20:43 - something like yeah this this should at
20:53 - least show us if you know if we're doing
20:56 - anything where we will need to actually
20:58 - go and import our component
21:08 - great
21:11 - okay we have a bunch of stuff finished
21:16 - authorship amazing let's see let's start
21:25 - by filing like no now my really first
21:29 - goal right and I really like to write
21:30 - like work in small achievable goals that
21:33 - I can get towards them that gives me
21:35 - something right so my first goal should
21:36 - just be to display like and and the
21:39 - empty Sudoku on the screen that'll make
21:41 - me happy or sad yeah yeah so we know
21:45 - it's just this will savor some typing
21:49 - just stick track Doku and say okay we
21:53 - have cocoa and then we'll want to hear
21:56 - cool rose map so we'll just met over
22:01 - each of these rows and for each row will
22:04 - make last name sounds reasonable yeah
22:13 - and then for each of these rows we sort
22:17 - of have a set of columns yes we should
22:22 - also react will complain you know no no
22:25 - it's really nice that I had this index
22:26 - rate because now we can actually sit he
22:32 - will and then here I think what we
22:35 - actually want here is sort of like a
22:37 - field right that that allows us to do
22:39 - input yes and and so on so I'll make a
22:43 - new component for that and call it in a
22:45 - field
22:47 - I don't know it's a little weird if
22:49 - column field but I'm not know is agate
22:52 - anything in so I will do this and I'll
23:00 - you see this the column actually not
23:03 - maybe I like to call this a field here
23:05 - even if sure because then we have like
23:11 - the row index and the column index in
23:14 - makes sense in we also have typos and
23:20 - let's do this now we need to actually
23:23 - create yep and then we can think about
23:41 - how do we want to render a field and it
23:44 - could be like from static could be as
23:46 - easy as just an input shoe last name
23:49 - field and the value would just be the
23:53 - let's do this again
24:03 - just be like this right and then we can
24:07 - even sit should it be read-only
24:09 - I actually react this vehicle is
24:13 - reminding me that's like some reason
24:16 - apiece I would trip me up every single
24:19 - time I think yeah okay so we still need
24:28 - to actually import this one so this is
24:31 - really nice while you're doing this and
24:33 - you're working away since you've got a
24:35 - build running which is like well do
24:37 - coding isn't doing you know yeah keeping
24:40 - everything refreshed yeah you can
24:42 - actually even without switching context
24:49 - okay so yeah I'm constantly getting this
24:55 - feedback right which results are just
24:57 - right again ten years ago this was not
24:59 - as smooth and of course cults it's not a
25:03 - function it's what I want to do is men
25:06 - over the car okay this is starting to
25:11 - look like something right like let's go
25:13 - big and just tweet this is this a little
25:15 - bit when you you've got it's not even
25:19 - just a list of things it is a grid it's
25:21 - great values are going in in the right
25:23 - places
25:24 - yes that's it that feels like a big step
25:27 - to me yeah yeah if I was really good I
25:34 - would like make it oh this is already
25:36 - starting to give this hitter a little
25:39 - knocking awesome maybe maybe make those
25:47 - numbers a little larger yeah in and
25:50 - actually like let's make let's do
25:53 - phonce
26:04 - thank you to look like something and
26:07 - then let's take all the read only ones
26:11 - and let's say when then when when it's
26:15 - the one you winter we make them like a
26:18 - little you know light and then when it's
26:20 - the read only one we make it back in
26:25 - let's see okay
26:27 - now you now we have something resembling
26:30 - this to the group board at least rate
26:33 - like so so that's a that's a stat yeah
26:36 - ideally I mean like that that's sort of
26:39 - we intrigued that later right like
26:40 - ideally we also wanted to create as well
26:46 - right again this mean something yeah for
26:50 - tasks like this where the bigger part of
26:52 - this is the logic in actual yeah another
26:54 - team yeah yeah that's the place to go
26:57 - first then we can precisely right so
27:00 - this is a really typical first thing
27:01 - okay now let's see okay I have something
27:03 - now right like and and note some of the
27:06 - things I did for example like up here
27:08 - right like it's pretty obvious that this
27:10 - is not going to be the right place where
27:11 - this function should should live yeah
27:13 - that's something when I'm like starting
27:16 - out getting something working getting
27:18 - out I often really like just putting
27:20 - something in the same file assign me in
27:25 - and and because that's like the most
27:28 - trivial refactoring in the world ever to
27:30 - like put that into its own little
27:32 - component and pull it in right but but
27:34 - right when I'm just playing around it
27:36 - it's it can become like a bit of a
27:39 - stream of consciousness the way I'm
27:40 - thinking of doing the whole in one place
27:42 - before you go and optimize things make
27:44 - tidy things up and get them get them
27:46 - refactored cause the oh you're actually
27:48 - gonna push this at this moment and this
27:51 - is this is something I've been as I've
27:53 - been walking around the teams during the
27:55 - day and seeing how they've been working
27:56 - since they're many people working
27:57 - together yeah it was really nice to see
28:00 - that people have fairly quickly reached
28:02 - a point that they're they're sharing
28:04 - code together in a repo and they're
28:05 - sharing progress
28:06 - so as different people are making making
28:08 - commits they're pushing and pushing them
28:10 - up to the project that is rebuilding in
28:12 - exactly the same way that you know
28:13 - you're doing now and people can
28:16 - share the progress they can see how
28:17 - they're getting on and it's it's living
28:21 - and breathing right from the outset so
28:23 - it's really nice to be able to share
28:24 - these results and get them get them on a
28:26 - on a URL yeah I really agree I mean if I
28:30 - was a bit more of a team I would even do
28:31 - this with full requests and sure yeah
28:39 - [Laughter]
28:48 - well I just push this live and again and
28:50 - anyone following should in a moment be
28:52 - able to actually go to Sue's and get a
28:58 - random sodoku right in so now we should
29:01 - maybe start figuring out like you should
29:03 - probably not be oh yes things like this
29:05 - and there should be some indication of
29:08 - where you're at and so on each time you
29:11 - refresh that page is that giving you a
29:13 - new Sudokus yes and yeah because with
29:16 - this generated yeah in the constructor
29:18 - of the app right we're just doing and
29:19 - generate pseudo pollution now we
29:21 - actually already have a public-facing
29:22 - like pseudo code generator and we're
29:24 - right like that took me a lot longer and
29:32 - we've come a long way yeah precisely
29:34 - right so so let's see let's think about
29:37 - okay now now we start having data
29:39 - travelling down right so so this was
29:42 - really want to talked about okay make
29:43 - make this data structure think about how
29:45 - its structured so we can easily have it
29:47 - propagate down a tree of your own
29:48 - Android and we have this very logical
29:50 - tree like system now now of course when
29:54 - when I do edits here and so on right we
29:56 - need to be able to have data travel back
29:58 - up in propagate up right so in here in
30:03 - our field I think will already see the
30:04 - console is saying hey why are you
30:06 - setting a value when a that's null and
30:10 - and the wire you're not having like any
30:13 - callbacks on your field so first to make
30:16 - this one a little heavy we'll do this
30:18 - and we'll have values that no no and
30:20 - then it's saying like yeah why don't you
30:22 - have an unchanged handler because you're
30:24 - setting a value
30:25 - you're not sitting in him so we should
30:28 - of course sitting in so we want to do
30:32 - some unchanged in let's handle change in
30:40 - and change in handler here in and which
30:53 - probably just say so now now we are
30:58 - starting to presume okay like since
31:00 - we're not going to be using any fancy
31:02 - state management or something which is
31:04 - going to be propagating just stayed up
31:06 - and down in reacting this is something
31:09 - that you could do if like hooks a
31:11 - reduction and so on but but I like
31:13 - studying this really simple right yes I
31:15 - understand and then unchanged what we
31:17 - want to do is that we want to take their
31:19 - their the current field and then we want
31:24 - to update the value to be a new value
31:28 - now we probably want to clean up that
31:30 - value a little bit so we want to see
31:33 - okay that value we we want to make sure
31:36 - we kind of pass this into an integer
31:40 - even if it comes from from from lake
31:44 - each of these fields those will be
31:46 - strengths we type in right now just
31:48 - absolutely but but we want to keep like
31:51 - again we want to think as if we had a
31:53 - type system right you think okay the
31:55 - value should definitively not sometimes
31:56 - be a string and sometimes be an integer
32:00 - yeah in so want to propagate up this
32:03 - value now here we have like a problem
32:05 - because what if the value is actually
32:07 - empty in in so what if it's just the
32:13 - empty string then we just want to accept
32:16 - that and otherwise we want to try to
32:18 - pass it into an int yeah in this like
32:22 - this is like an okay stat now we can
32:25 - propagate this up so now we should pass
32:27 - down some handlers in so here we want to
32:30 - pass down here we actually probably just
32:33 - want to assume because the good thing is
32:35 - that with the data structure we had
32:37 - right like if we go back and look at
32:38 - yeah every single field has like the row
32:41 - and column and so on right so so when we
32:45 - get like an updated value here it's it's
32:48 - easy to at the very top level go in and
32:51 - and and find the right field to actually
32:54 - it it yes so here we can just assume
32:56 - that we're getting pests down some event
32:58 - handler and see on change or something
33:02 - like that what's that wait I called it
33:03 - yeah yeah this props unchanged yet so
33:06 - we'll just assume here that we also has
33:09 - like an unchanged handle oppressed in
33:13 - here and then we should actually write
33:19 - an unchanged handler in that we can pass
33:22 - in here right it's amazing to see how
33:27 - quickly it pays dividends just when you
33:30 - were like thinking about your data
33:32 - structure yeah yeah you might kind of
33:35 - sketch that somewhere you might would it
33:36 - be actually putting it right there in
33:37 - the code yeah this would also be kind of
33:39 - shared around if you were working with
33:40 - someone else a team and you and you can
33:43 - refer back to that thinking and it's
33:44 - kind of it I mean it's not just the
33:46 - process of writing that helps you
33:47 - internalize it but also we've got that
33:49 - reference straightaway and you've been
33:50 - you've been making use of it right away
33:57 - this change and yeah it has a call in
34:00 - something right and I should do with
34:02 - some kind of this sit state within your
34:04 - state but this is where this is where I
34:06 - quickly feel like oh that's a lot of
34:09 - state to to handle if it's like all
34:11 - mutating and like how do I make sure
34:13 - that it's not some weird conditions
34:15 - going on and then fortunately the other
34:17 - day is Sean weighing from from our team
34:21 - wrote this great post on our blog about
34:24 - EEMA yeah which which is really really
34:27 - cool library so so in when it comes to
34:30 - another inspiration from from sort of
34:32 - Haskell world and so on it's this whole
34:34 - idea of immutable data structures Yeah
34:38 - right like and and and of having data
34:40 - that doesn't change in you you you take
34:44 - like one value and then you take a new
34:46 - value yes you don't your own change is a
34:49 - progression of a value of something
34:51 - it's a it's it's always like a
34:53 - transformation from my setup values to
34:55 - another right and mr is really cool like
34:58 - they have some great illustrations you
35:00 - have of these kind of transformations
35:03 - but it's a really cool way of doing it
35:06 - in waste with without really having to
35:09 - learn like immutable Gaia's or some
35:12 - different kind of data structure or
35:14 - anything like that so now I edit immer
35:18 - and then I'll import let me just see how
35:20 - they do it import produce from Emma and
35:25 - then we'll do a little trick here so
35:29 - we'll say okay produce from this let's
35:39 - see if this works basically the the way
35:42 - mr does it is that it has this little
35:45 - producer take some initial state and
35:47 - then it and then it returns a function
35:53 - for updating that state and and inside
35:55 - that function you can pretend that the
35:57 - state is mutable but but everything ends
35:59 - up being a immutable nice let me just
36:03 - first see if I if I'm breaking
36:05 - everything now I can see that there's
36:07 - some I'm definitely missing yeah here we
36:22 - go okay so now we're back again we have
36:23 - exactly the same state with the
36:25 - difference that Emmer in my turns this
36:27 - into sort of a proxy object and so on so
36:29 - now this state is immutable
36:30 - I can't actually accidentally change it
36:34 - and this means that she and my in my
36:37 - handle change right like on the EMA site
36:39 - they'll have some good example of a
36:41 - fusing instead of this traditional way
36:43 - of saying okay now I need to like sort
36:45 - of unpack this whole object and put it
36:48 - together again yeah I can just call
36:51 - produce and take the state modify it and
36:54 - and Emma will handle that hold so I can
36:57 - go in here and say it's state and say
36:59 - produce and then take a function that
37:03 - takes the current state
37:04 - and then it just it just mutate it in
37:08 - here it does actually do mutation but
37:11 - it's not in it's not that painful so we
37:15 - have these rows and then from our
37:17 - element we have like the row ID and now
37:21 - we'll have some columns and then we'll
37:23 - have our collide E and that will have a
37:25 - value that now we want to update boom
37:29 - let's see yep's I can't do things and I
37:38 - can't type now you can see I can type in
37:40 - E
37:40 - yeah right right for those that don't
37:41 - can see it I'm desperately trying to put
37:43 - similar to my pseudo queue right now and
37:46 - and I can't I can only put in numbers
37:49 - now right so now we already got this
37:50 - this data flow work that's fantastic
37:52 - that's yeah that takes us such a long
37:53 - way in such a short time we use about
37:55 - you can tell you just like again like
37:57 - building these kind of things ten years
38:01 - ago in the browser which is so hot right
38:04 - and now now you have this really clear
38:06 - state abstraction all the state is just
38:08 - flowing down a tree it's immutable we
38:10 - understand where it's coming from and so
38:12 - on right now next thing I want to do is
38:15 - is start checking if the pseudo quiz has
38:18 - been solved or not and this is one thing
38:20 - I realized when I was doing like it like
38:22 - playing around with this earlier and
38:24 - that is that I'm not very good at
38:25 - solving you should anymore spend an hour
38:30 - building as so I'm gonna cheat a little
38:38 - writer like I'm gonna I'm gonna add a
38:42 - little button with an unclick and learn
38:44 - that this is the flip to the back of the
38:49 - stoker book button so you can see the
38:51 - solution and then we are gonna make a
39:00 - pseudo code handler here and let's see
39:05 - so one of the things we want kind of
39:08 - anyway I think in already when we when
39:11 - we generate our structure up here is
39:14 - actually we probably also want to to
39:18 - keep the solution around right yeah
39:21 - because like we we need to actually be
39:24 - able to verify yes if you're doing the
39:26 - right wrong right yeah it's not no
39:27 - reason to keep doing that and we have
39:29 - this solve puzzle thing yeah again I've
39:33 - exposed it to my little cheating ripple
39:35 - right you know we have this tulip that's
39:37 - across all in so I can do this right and
39:43 - then we can say generator is solve
39:45 - puzzle puzzle and see oh this one is the
39:50 - sweet sweet the same one but just with
39:53 - the results right so here we'll just say
39:55 - generator and we will immediately take
39:59 - stuff possible and say okay solve the
40:01 - puzzle and story that's the solution and
40:04 - then the other thing I would probably
40:06 - start doing is writing a little chick
40:11 - tech solution or something in passing
40:14 - that should up with structure and then
40:17 - we need to sort of now now we have these
40:20 - and we kind of want to unwrap them again
40:22 - yeah probably say okay we have something
40:25 - like a candidate for solution mmm and
40:28 - then we take the pseudo ku rose
40:32 - yes we map over each row for each row we
40:37 - take the columns remember where each
40:40 - column we take the value and
40:45 - in modern JavaScript it's like nice
40:49 - enough that we can just say okay and
40:50 - then just make it a flattery yep so now
40:52 - we're back and we have a structure
40:55 - that's the same so now we can just start
40:58 - again really simple just say
41:08 - and then this like a really you see
41:10 - first chick which is like if the
41:12 - candidate if the candidate value is
41:17 - equal to an empty string um we scrape
41:23 - out of that I did way I tell you what's
41:25 - it ignore it's actually not right could
41:27 - we actually do that we should probably
41:28 - again we should keep it really strongly
41:30 - type yes so we should actually make this
41:32 - same null because otherwise which
41:34 - sometimes have strengths and sometimes
41:35 - and all and we really old like that try
41:38 - to miss with Haskell right like you can
41:40 - so easily mix up your types but we want
41:42 - to keep it really straight to type right
41:43 - so if it's no then we know that we we
41:46 - don't need to take it you know it can be
41:48 - your salt yet right in or if the value
41:54 - here is not exactly equal to the to the
42:00 - sued aqua solution then we should return
42:05 - false right then there's no reason to go
42:07 - I guess more pieces right and if we make
42:09 - it all the way through and we haven't
42:11 - return false which you say yes great so
42:13 - now we have a function for checking his
42:15 - solution in in this is the this where's
42:18 - the point where it's like oh how it was
42:19 - sold so am I actually kind of trying to
42:20 - solve one of these just to figure out if
42:22 - that function works right ideally I
42:24 - would have set up like some test suite
42:26 - in something like this is what I'm
42:27 - missing now my party in there would be
42:29 - by two maybe if I had more than an hour
42:31 - if this was like a reading project there
42:33 - is definitively set up some way of
42:35 - running tests right like that would make
42:38 - it so easy to to write a little field
42:40 - test of that frightened and see if it
42:42 - actually makes sense instead we will
42:45 - write a function to magically self in in
42:49 - a way in your ruining sodoku for
42:51 - everyone on you let's see what are we
42:57 - gonna do in to magically solve this I
43:01 - guess we can run through
43:05 - well one it will run us some somehow
43:08 - like take each of these and find the
43:10 - right value yes yeah and so I guess we
43:13 - can actually just like do something
43:15 - similar and say in this stage Doku and
43:20 - then just for each row take the row and
43:27 - then for in the columns for each column
43:32 - take that one and then in here we'll
43:36 - just want to see in if it's not out we
43:45 - okay actually we will really make sure
43:47 - we do this with with our mr produce
43:50 - right because we want to actually update
43:52 - the state through the salt so you're
43:55 - right you'll be doing this same trick of
43:57 - seeing okay let's take the stage inside
44:00 - produce and then and then inside here we
44:05 - can do all of these nice mutations
44:07 - mm-hmm why you can't so if it's not a
44:17 - read-only column then set the column
44:19 - value to in there's stage cool solution
44:27 - and then we have the same at some point
44:30 - we should probably make some helper
44:32 - method to that right but we have the
44:33 - same kind of local function where we say
44:35 - okay in column row times nine plus
44:42 - column
44:47 - I think she's that right oh there's a
44:52 - new age of the candidates right in the
44:55 - first thing is that value is not defined
44:58 - and light forty year
45:06 - now we have this room that didn't work
45:10 - very well in regional aim because I'm
45:16 - trying to do in the actual up gauge
45:18 - let's see where was it 71 I want to do
45:24 - this for each rooms ready so I'm just
45:27 - running over you troll and interact look
45:32 - quite right so there's something
45:34 - something is not right in Atlantis
45:36 - so is that are those zeros so we've got
45:38 - early is this a tripod that it's
45:41 - actually a really good point yeah
45:42 - because up here yeah that's a really
45:45 - good point yeah there's actually both
45:53 - the point
45:55 - so did we ever correct
46:04 - I'm not seeing any zeros here so we did
46:07 - fix it in the me class on the world
46:17 - [Music]
46:32 - okay yeah it's totally the zeroes that
46:34 - are creating an issue right notice how
46:36 - we're never seeing any zeros again this
46:38 - is this is the this is a gun show of
46:40 - type on type languages right here saying
46:43 - if if and zero matches and yeah so the
46:47 - first thing we want to do is probably to
47:03 - right let's see let's see if we start
47:07 - getting some lines yeah okay great but
47:10 - also that makes me feel more at ease
47:12 - sing nested okay with the right number
47:15 - and we can write navigate around there
47:18 - kind of type issue the solution will
47:21 - always have one so let's just just say
47:23 - like this
47:26 - [Music]
47:36 - so about here can I read frozen hmm
48:02 - just picking this apart and yeah
48:20 - Oh
48:27 - haha old friend our friend cancel lock
48:31 - okay
48:33 - it did it did lock something out earlier
48:36 - up the page isn't it spot what it was
48:40 - there we go now he's up there somewhere
48:43 - yeah it's not okay that actually yeah
48:50 -  we can't do this because now
48:56 - because the self person in expect the
48:59 - format or the the raw format a well so
49:03 - it's like a little annoyance here oh
49:05 - that's a shame that would he was getting
49:06 - such a tidy solutions yeah yeah that's a
49:15 - shame but that that that this mean that
49:18 - we might want it yeah
49:26 - it's awfully annoying okay I'm gonna do
49:30 - a quick
50:26 - okay
50:41 - okay now now we have this something who
50:48 - is because we are saying nines now as
50:50 - well so we are seeing nines now right
50:52 - like now it's probably just this mapping
50:54 - of of rows and columns that are some ago
51:00 - right when we when we say okay let's
51:03 - solve this yeah
51:21 - is
51:36 - again this is where just wheat would be
51:39 - life yeah absolutely
51:43 - mm-hmm
51:45 - so this is the state before in the
51:48 - solution so the solution here three
51:55 - seven one three six two and then it's
52:03 - something it's something related to it
52:06 - not just keep just giving these
52:08 - read-only or something like that let's
52:11 - [Music]
52:15 - okay okay now we now we have this solid
52:20 - matically button in okay so there was a
52:24 - sudden out now we now now now we know we
52:26 - can we can solve these pseudo crews very
52:28 - fast yeah in and now we can start is
52:31 - saying okay whenever we handle this
52:35 - change we should also have some function
52:38 - to you need to see if it's old oh yeah
52:43 - something like that right where I'm just
52:46 - going to see okay first of all I'm
52:49 - probably gonna introduce like assault
52:51 - yeah we could even we're gonna introduce
52:53 - some more we could say like okay
52:56 - up here when when we create the pseudo
52:59 - chrome maybe we want to say okay we have
53:01 - these roads we have this solution we
53:04 - have this that time which is a new page
53:08 - we started it now we can have the result
53:12 - hey somebody were recycling precisely
53:16 - okay so we have a start time in a stall
53:18 - time right and then here in okay this is
53:24 - this is all the same then
53:31 - and then here we can say okay if first
53:36 - of all we can we can start by checking
53:46 - because if we've already sorted you just
53:49 - never be wearing em yeah but if if it's
53:51 - solved in and we if we don't have a soft
53:54 - time we can say okay hold it up here
54:03 - check solution and we can pass in
54:09 - actually realizing that we'll probably
54:11 - want this to be a part of our state
54:14 - change here and that means we don't
54:16 - really want it to be a handler because
54:18 - we'll get some weird race condition
54:20 - degree when she is passing State okay so
54:28 - we're gonna see okay is it is it gonna
54:31 - be solved in by sitting up here it's
54:42 - just that before we extract it to
54:44 - anonymous yeah
54:57 - later
55:10 - it's now in theory we should start
55:13 - setting a soft time if the pseudocode
55:16 - has been sold huh
55:18 - now we're passing this in so maybe in
55:22 - here in our board we can go in and see
55:43 - right borders actually yeah that's
55:47 - that's a curious effect and
55:53 - okay let's see why we didn't solve it in
55:57 - [Music]
56:03 - with the logic intensely detecting if it
56:06 - had been solved or just just the
56:09 - reporting of it couldn't quite so
56:13 - basically here we should be checking if
56:17 - it had in salt and I mean that is the
56:19 - function we haven't quite checked it yet
56:22 - so we again
56:27 - [Laughter]
56:39 - it's not happening right right
56:48 - is our handler running is I change
56:50 - Honduran even firing and that I do think
56:54 - it is yeah but it's double check
57:03 - yep yeah it's probably people screaming
57:10 - at the life so it's obviously the
57:19 - condition here in oh oh in that's just
57:25 - that the short time so up here yeah this
57:36 - is because we are setting the soft time
57:38 - to keep it so there'll be this weird
57:43 - thing where I need to go into yep this
57:45 - was and now we detect okay you solve
57:47 - this okay so that's so that so that's
57:51 - great then while we're not solving it
57:54 - will obviously want to show some kind of
57:56 - timer right right in so let's make a
58:00 - little timer component
58:09 - let's figure out how a timer should
58:11 - behave it's gonna start to feel pretty
58:15 - pretty complete in terms of the
58:17 - functionality is that point I think yeah
58:18 - yeah populating it will be a check to
58:20 - see if it's old yes to watch for the
58:24 - entry even though we're cheating to
58:27 - populate it but we'll be able to report
58:32 - if it's old or not and if we if this
58:35 - time is updating as well it sounds like
58:38 - it's a that's gonna be good to push so
58:45 - typically in the timer it's like hmm
58:48 - it's useful to hit some state that
58:55 - that's maybe later second sit elapsed
58:58 - starting at zero in and and let's see
59:07 - forgetting the new a fancier life cycle
59:12 - methods but we'll just do this when it
59:15 - mount will say sit just good old
59:24 - JavaScript sitting in inducing using sit
59:31 - stage to just say a elapsed is now let's
59:38 - see how we do it
59:42 - I'm expecting to pair since that time
59:46 - that's a date mm-hmm so we all want to
59:50 - say we're going to take the time right
59:56 - now and subtract the time from date and
60:04 - then this is going to be milliseconds so
60:06 - we want to get it in seconds and then we
60:09 - want to round down soon I have some
60:10 - weird like because people don't tend to
60:13 - think in milliseconds
60:14 - I mean I love the optimism that we're
60:16 - gonna be reporting this in seconds I was
60:17 - thinking like like days or serious you
60:21 - duck food solvers right like this is hit
60:24 - hard or challenge
60:29 - okay now we have this time whether we
60:32 - should probably try to show it something
60:33 - yeah we also ought to do what's called
60:35 - component too well unmount or something
60:39 - you can say even to listener you're
60:49 - hanging and then here no board we can
60:52 - import a timer yeah oops something good
60:54 - you know typos in that I just I just
60:58 - fulfilled my value is the pair okay so
61:05 - we only want to show that we don't have
61:08 - the final time right
61:17 - I think we called it like that no yep
61:21 - there we go nice we have a time you have
61:24 - a time right now with it and then
61:26 - hearing the result like so maybe we
61:28 - should actually make that a little
61:30 - component in the self and say okay we
61:32 - have some little result component that
61:34 - will show what what happens right yeah
61:43 - okay and then we'll return little things
61:48 - here but what what I want is what I want
61:50 - to do here is something similar to the
61:52 - timer I want to get that elapsed time
61:54 - right so yeah so in the result we will
61:57 - have they're all half there right now
62:03 - I'm just gonna pitch in and then we'll
62:08 - want to have like it laps to be in same
62:13 - calculation right I don't want to take
62:15 - this you don't cool a solve time and
62:21 - take the millisecond snip and then
62:24 - subtract its that time and we'll want it
62:32 - yeah
62:34 - and then
62:47 - that's good and let's get it on the
62:49 - board it's the excitement isn't it yes I
62:58 - am I'm a horrible and slow type I know
63:01 - in general honestly right like it's it's
63:04 - a and I'm super like some people really
63:09 - like a very very punch speakers about
63:12 - how fast they can use the editors and so
63:15 - on and I'm I've never really been
63:17 - obsessing over this it's pretty likely
63:19 - this is you've been moving quite quickly
63:21 - I've shown yeah all right
63:23 - okay let's see well actually have to
63:26 - cheat a little right like and you know
63:28 - fill this in yes all this weirdo point
63:30 - in seven seconds oh nice nice okey I
63:34 - think this warrants like cleaning up
63:36 - some consoling and committing great I
63:40 - think yeah this feels like functionally
63:44 - does exactly what what we would have set
63:46 - out to do yeah so now we have like the
63:50 - the basic outfit right like I will
63:52 - probably extract this so you get rid of
63:54 - this at some point I would really yeah I
64:06 - actually check this an NPM import Konami
64:11 - [Laughter]
64:19 - okay and then I mean then then we could
64:22 - go in and do more things so we could
64:24 - wrap it up right like so now we have
64:26 - this basic thing right like what I did
64:28 - in my original challenge which which is
64:30 - actually not a big step up from this but
64:32 - but is to say okay so so let's say we
64:35 - we've been working on this for a while
64:37 - and I've solved this in 41 seconds yeah
64:40 - now how about that I could send you this
64:43 - very same pseudo cool yes and say like
64:46 - hey now you saw right in in in these
64:48 - seconds right but at the moment this is
64:51 - being generated like a fresh with every
64:53 - every single time it is right so we can
64:57 - actually do something pretty quick to
64:59 - get around
65:00 - and just to give you a concept of how we
65:02 - can make it shareable right you know so
65:04 - this is really basic and that especially
65:05 - secure anything but but but just to see
65:09 - like it's not the end of the world at
65:11 - people in so now I'm am gonna go and
65:15 - take this stuff here and put it into its
65:19 - own little library mm-hm
65:23 - it starts becoming a little messy to
65:25 - have it out there let's export this
65:27 - generate pseudo cool that export this
65:30 - check solution and let's go here and
65:34 - then import generate pseudo cool and
65:40 - check solution from now we are back
65:48 - again right so one of the things we
65:50 - would want to use yeah because I'm
65:55 - calling generator generate pseudo coo
65:58 - and we just want to call
66:08 - okay it because up here I'm talking
66:12 - about a generator and we haven't
66:14 - actually important
66:17 - we haven't actually imported the NPM
66:19 - tsuyoku right here we go
66:26 - okay so now we've begged in right and
66:28 - basically what we need to be able to
66:30 - send someone the challenge is some form
66:32 - of URL yeah with this ruku in it right
66:35 - so we can say okay in let's have some
66:42 - share URL that we can generate for
66:44 - pseudocode this first step right in and
66:47 - basically we'll we'll want some data in
66:50 - that URL that's like hey let's get that
66:53 - in let's basically get what this one is
66:56 - generating right like that make puzzle
66:58 - right so let's get this raw one in there
67:01 - right maybe we want to keep now we now
67:06 - we've multiplied everything so maybe
67:08 - we're gonna keep it around here so just
67:11 - so we have it for generating there the
67:13 - data here right you know in so we want
67:17 - that we probably also want some more
67:19 - right we want who should we send the
67:21 - pseudocode to yeah to be able to well
67:25 - not in the URL yeah yeah we didn't so
67:27 - this one went through right when you
67:28 - actually sent this meal if we don't have
67:31 - a database or something we want that URL
67:33 - to also have who do we send it from and
67:35 - who do we send it to so once you're done
67:36 - we can send it to the one that oh wow so
67:41 - this is just like going a little bit but
67:43 - we probably we can start without decent
67:46 - even if we just said we could not good
67:48 - we can we can use your own right in the
67:50 - basis of you yeah so what we'll have in
67:52 - the data room and let's take that data
67:55 - and say okay we'll have the roster Doku
67:58 - in then we will want this that time
68:05 - mm-hmm and we'll want the soft time
68:09 - right because those two will want to
68:13 - to verify right a then a really handy
68:24 - thing is that all the browsers now again
68:26 - this is something that they didn't you
68:27 - said right buddy they have these two
68:29 - functions and I always forget which one
68:31 - they switch it to be and Beach way in so
68:35 - it should be it be 2 a1
68:38 - visa for base64 encoding of our strings
68:43 - these are these are built in to build
68:46 - into the browser's I know right and it's
68:51 - so easy now right like you just say okay
68:53 - Jason stringify data repertory and now
68:58 - you have like now we have like a query
69:06 - string with all of this just encoded in
69:08 - the query right and then we can do
69:10 - something like like returning the
69:13 - document location a truth in we want to
69:18 - make sure we don't end up with a lot of
69:19 - core strings I'm just gonna do some
69:21 - replace like this is really quick and
69:23 - dirty right but I'm just gonna say
69:25 - whoops
69:26 - what did Mitchell code tried to help me
69:28 - with that I'm just gonna say okay if
69:31 - there is a query string everything then
69:33 - remove it and then you add like the
69:37 - pseudo cool is super crafty like that
69:42 - okay now we have a share URL in itself
69:46 - that's not gonna help us super much
69:49 - apart from like what are we going to do
69:52 - with it right so yourself actually
69:54 - decode that yeah so we have we have to
69:57 - get some kind of like up here we'll want
69:59 - to check are we getting this raw one
70:02 - from the generator are we getting it
70:04 - from this year URL yeah are we getting
70:06 - and now we're getting some so we'll want
70:08 - something like from your
70:16 - something like this right and then we
70:18 - can write this function extract URL data
70:21 - and we can say okay here we go let's
70:24 - first see in so this will give us the
70:33 - query param and then it's a it's one of
70:39 - those in three honest we could even do a
70:44 - check right now we don't have a query
70:46 - parameter levels I know you put I
70:49 - thought you said oka was the query
70:50 - parameter yeah yeah I just mean like
70:52 - here we always see in the browser so I
70:54 - just wanted to make sure okay we have a
70:55 - string so then we can just let let's do
70:57 - let's do even just do a match so you
70:59 - know like this is gonna be really a
71:02 - brute force
71:04 - let's bring not ampersand okay that's
71:11 - where one and if we get a match then we
71:14 - know we have a URL in here it'll return
71:17 - know if we don't have one and if we have
71:20 - one here we can see okay so the first
71:24 - value is this one so now we just want to
71:26 - do with the you need to be and we want
71:30 - to do with adjacent on that value
71:40 - in this way I wish it had started with a
71:42 - just framework because it would make it
71:44 - so much easier but I don't well
71:48 - sometimes you sometimes you're leasing
71:50 - the wrong place yeah but okay now now we
71:55 - can both like share URL and we can
71:56 - extract this royalty and up here we can
71:58 - say okay if we extract this then we
72:02 - could say from URL if we already have
72:05 - the URL then just take the raw value
72:07 - from there in other ways you here and
72:10 - then this is exactly the same this is
72:13 - the same this is the same and then we
72:16 - just want sort of their Challenger that
72:21 - time
72:30 - and Challenger all the time college
72:45 - okay so now in theory we should have all
72:49 - the information to know if there's a
72:51 - challenger in the URL and so on yes now
72:53 - we should just to figure out like okay
72:56 - if we actually solve this Sudoku in we
73:02 - should also update the pseudocode with
73:05 - this year URL and we'll want to import
73:10 - what we call the function the ship we
73:15 - just called it share URL we did
73:16 - yeah there's okay so here we go we take
73:26 - they share your L and can read it from
73:29 - ours so what's the right signature right
73:35 - yep okay so now in theory we have a URL
73:39 - that we can start sharing so now it's
73:41 - just up to us and our result here to say
73:44 - okay you solve this in these seconds
73:54 - and then see ya it challenge yeah
73:59 - friends want enemy and I know why would
74:08 - do that but still aim and it'll be a
74:12 - little silly because it'll just open in
74:13 - your browser this way no one can get in
74:16 - so then it would just be listed of
74:19 - course yeah right now
74:32 - and we're gonna find out
74:36 - yeah let's take that okay so let's see
74:44 - it's it's totally cheat right and then
74:47 - and then somewhere get a shilling great
74:50 - like I can copy this link address and
74:52 - and send it to you you and then I can
74:55 - remove the magic button and yeah and
74:58 - here you go right like let's let's see
75:00 - if this actually so did this actually no
75:04 - it it didn't pick the right room so
75:07 - let's figure out why why we didn't now
75:10 - but now we have now we have like an easy
75:12 - test case here right like we have this
75:13 - one over here in well it will change the
75:17 - students I update stuff then that that's
75:20 - the one piece library though sometimes
75:22 - um but in let's see why don't we get
75:27 - this we do have this rhetorical query
75:31 - string and I think I think I know
75:38 - because we are doing this wrong cool
75:46 - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think we
75:50 - are almost there now right like I think
75:51 - we're actually gonna get this this ready
75:53 - right so so let's see I'm gonna open
75:58 - this share link it's it's it's all your
76:15 - changes oh well I mean I think we're
76:18 - pretty much there right like I think
76:20 - this is this one okay look at the match
76:24 - no no this does seem like it should be
76:27 - right No
76:30 - [Music]
76:42 - yeah yeah we are getting we're getting
76:44 - all the right stuff so we are we not
76:52 - using it I mean this actually seems
76:57 - right we are showing the right one and
76:59 - you will see that now in this one we are
77:02 - getting this let's see if I think we're
77:13 - just looking at the wrong one let's
77:15 - let's let's let's see if we're just like
77:18 - in okay let's see in four to five seven
77:25 - mm nope no so why are we getting the
77:30 - wrong one
77:31 - so the problem then must be with not
77:34 - with that but with the share URL it
77:38 - seems like right we actually we are we
77:58 - certainly using it when we yeah it seems
78:01 - like we're sitting the wrong data here
78:03 - yeah it's so close right we look at the
78:09 - URL what's the shelling that we actually
78:12 - yeah so this was and and and I did have
78:17 - that like we don't have this process
78:21 - here right like and you can see it's
78:23 - right one and we can see that we are
78:26 - setting the same every to you in
78:35 - hmm okay something is wrong when we
78:38 - solve it and so the problem might
78:42 - actually be the magic solver function
78:44 - that misses something up it's gonna wind
78:47 - up being that the easiest way to test it
78:49 - is to manually solve the Sudoku No okay
78:54 - so the problem the problem is totally
78:57 - there there we it is actually our manual
79:02 - I think everything is working except for
79:04 - this cheating function I think so I
79:14 - think so okay well I mean well it feels
79:19 - like we're we're within so I will I will
79:25 - I'll do this okay okay and then I would
79:32 - like to say that that that without that
79:34 - the religions without the cheat if I
79:36 - could solve this the main issue being
79:38 - back would be to actually here in in the
79:41 - result in handle a case where where
79:44 - where where we have one right like so in
79:48 - so here we would just have and this we
79:52 - won't have time to to test now in him
79:56 - but we had this field called the
79:59 - Challenger is salt time right so in this
80:03 - result we can go in and see in if there
80:08 - is a challenge assault time yeah then
80:10 - maybe put a little h3 here saying your
80:13 - opponent solved in and yeah we don't
80:21 - want to do that little piece of math up
80:23 - here
80:31 - and exam yes seems like something that
80:36 - should be extracted into its own method
80:38 - in because this is like well that's
80:44 - that's the way it works with getting
80:46 - something together quickly getting the
80:48 - steel thread yeah getting it working
80:49 - yeah then we can yes we can then we can
80:52 - optimize right like there's a bunch of
80:54 - things we could we did we could make
80:57 - smooth all right I think this is gonna
81:03 - be our last piece of functionality yeah
81:05 - it is it is okay and then we can say
81:13 - your opponents opted in and we have okay
81:29 - okay in theory this is in theory this is
81:34 - our fully working through double
81:36 - challenge that we can share I'll commit
81:42 - this yeah in tandem yeah once we Justice
81:48 - a nice I love the I love that
81:51 - combination message working working
81:54 - solution it's this thing it's my it's my
81:57 - way of saying yeah thank you love
81:59 - working but hey I think we're in good
82:04 - shape I think yeah barring the fact that
82:08 - you have to actually go through yes yeah
82:11 - you have to actually solve this yeah
82:14 - that given because I think that I can
82:16 - really get that magic button through to
82:19 - to work again oh okay I like it as is I
82:21 - like the fact there's integrity to it it
82:23 - means the people that solve it but this
82:25 - is kind of remarkable so I mean we went
82:27 - a little over the how that we were
82:28 - chatting away everyone can still in an
82:31 - hour and twenty minutes we've gone from
82:33 - zero to having this kind of
82:35 - functionality in place it's been
82:37 - deployed out onto the web it's the kind
82:39 - of thing that
82:40 - now you can actually get get a shared
82:44 - URL is finishing his build right now as
82:47 - we speak
82:48 - its function is zero to functional in a
82:51 - little over an hour with chatting and
82:53 - yeah and and my help so that's amazing I
82:59 - think is the perfect perfect place to to
83:03 - close it it's kind of remarkable what
83:06 - what can be achieved in that amount of
83:08 - time I mean it's not just the tools were
83:10 - looking at here with like the with net
83:13 - the fight getting out and deployed but
83:14 - also the the modern capabilities of the
83:16 - browsers we have things that I was
83:18 - seeing there that I wasn't aware of and
83:20 - little utilities though I wish we had
83:22 - known about but also that the tools that
83:28 - we have in things like react and
83:31 - libraries that have in NPM what a wealth
83:34 - of resources they're in the hands of
83:39 - developers now is kind it's kind of
83:40 - incredible
83:41 - it isn't variable right this there's
83:43 - been fun for me because I basically
83:44 - built in in a now I'm miners like the
83:47 - one little legging component and it's
83:49 - like setting up a little lamp the
83:51 - function and sending a mail back and
83:52 - forth and so on right buddy yeah but
83:55 - that's that's actually a pretty trivial
83:57 - amount of work I did a little experiment
83:59 - before with me I'll gone right and and
84:02 - it's it's pretty girl right and and to
84:05 - see that that this can just pretty
84:07 - easily be built in an hour and deployed
84:09 - globally and like shared and and and
84:13 - done with like this kind of workflow in
84:16 - anything right like that that's just
84:17 - such a huge difference from 10 years ago
84:20 - when I was when I was building the same
84:22 - time you're being in in Ruby and rails
84:25 - and on dreamhost or something like that
84:28 - and and trying to make it run at all
84:31 - it's pretty remarkable Matt thanks so
84:33 - much for spending the time to do that
84:34 - and braving the challenge remarkably no
84:38 - biting stuff very easy

Cleaned transcript:

in addition to everyone who's building things here over the course of a couple of days we asked Matt if you'd build us something in an hour which that was that was a nice surprise right let's just say it was a surprise it was a surprise okay the nice part we'll wait and see and so we're gonna give that a try now we'll we'll see how we get on and we've got an hour to see you know what the process is what you dig through we'll we'll work through it together yeah it'll show up your your typing and talking skills well an hour of me cooling stackoverflow and making typos pretty much I did cheat a little and spent some time today prototyping what I'm gonna be working on just so so I'm not gonna stumbling around completely blind okay but I didn't let's let's see how it goes and if I still remember how to write code in between your Co II okay so in should we move so first of all can we can we show map screen we are we showing map screen at the moment yeah okay great so now there's no escape now Matt there's left so so if you're watching my screen you'll see that I'm doing this a little boilerplate that we made a little if I comb to create react Atlanta and basically it I think by now pretty much the far majority of people watching this dream will probably know create react app as being sort of their the really common starting points when you react applications in and I really this just gives me will see if I even get so far but this gives me the ability to write some serverside code during during during this stream okay in and I think it's just one of these things that I also talked about earlier in the live stream in how how how great it is to just start getting a basic flow setup before we actually start building our our app then that supports what we are going to build right now so in terms of what we're going to build the next thing I've given some thought to write in what do we call it in got any good name suggestions for super cool challenge yeah yeah that's not so come on Sudoku stack velcro stack okay okay so that's gonna be in the Louisville I get in the new repo in so basically what this deploy button does is that it sets up a new repo and there's an initial deploy of create react app and make sure I just have like a complete continuous deployment process to true globally distributed network and and they you know me a slammed the integration and all of that stuff and basically what what what I thought would be really fun to do for sort of an hourlong challenge is that back about ten years ago in when I had moved to Spain from been mark and and I was still at the time working as a music journalist in Denmark and and was starting to figure out that I was gonna stay in Spain and that there wasn't a lot of work in working as a writer covering music in Danish especially not when it was like contemporary classical music and and weird yes in Danish in Spain yeah yeah I liked it it was a surprise at the time but but it turned out that it just wasn't that high demand in something's wrong with the world but but that's how it was right in okay but back then I want one of the things I just started building or soon was was this is pseudocode challenge and so I built this challenge where you could like go to a webpage you could get us sued aku you could solve it on time and then you could send the mail to a friend with the same Sudoku and and challenge that person to like see if you can beat my time but in fact then that was like a pretty big project actually if it was back in in the early days of rails right and and everything was if everything was was serverside and so on when rails app wasn't it wasn't the easy right and just just the whole story around like the browser and JavaScript was really different years ago right so so even just the concept of like okay how how am I gonna me and interactive UI for Sudoku singing in a browser it was much more peach based of like having all these forms and sending it to a rails controller and rendering it response and so on and of course all all the pseudocode generation in I I had to come up with a way to do through this I found this old repository I made back then like 10 years ago right this is the one to say original so this is this is an a version of it that I wrote in Group E so one of the things that was a constraint back then was that this had to run on my server during the redwood quest and and service are smaller back then and ruby is kind of sad and deployments were really hot yeah so I actually also rewrote this and see that's a ruby extension just to get the performance for for generating these these rubies so this is like a DLX based on but it's like based on an old day in computer science paper by Donald Knuth around an algorithm called dancing links in that really like if someone wants like some mindbending fun go and read that paper image and and do the logic and and see why it's called dancing links and visualizer and a lot of fun but like again one of these things that's that's changed now right from from back when I when I had to do it that way yeah it said today we can maybe just go on NPM and then we do with like pseudo coup and we get like oh there's like NPM gaya / pseudo code that's a relief because I was worried yeah and it's been the next our hindrance anyway right but now I can just like NPM pseudo cool makes Indonesia yeah it's a little like kidding but that's that's the resources we have medicine that's what it's all about now right like so so what have you been to while you were talking you yeah you do so basically I set up my locale devera development environment by like what what what net if I did for me was setting up like this new website it has its own URL if anybody deployed if anyone is fast enough to capture this URL from the lime stream you can go there and follow along it's a dist yeah and it also created a new repository so again if anyone goes to kill men in its the other test is spelling my name right and then dr. stack you you can actually find the the source code I'm working this is what this is yeah this is what was cloned and then I just downloaded it and ran a yawn to to install all of the internet locally right and and Yanis even it's nicer than npm in that it actually since i practiced this a little before it realized that and it seems really surprised how fast it was nice so by this stage then you've already got your continuous integration setup got a site yes configured on that the fire that's watching a repository and you also download clone that repository locally so you've got a local environment CI environment yep city everything right and and i can here in the local repository I just did a yawn yawn at pseudo cool right like so that was what took me like it back ten years ago then I spent like a month implementing tunnel clearance dancing links and everything and transpiling it to see and now I just died young at do you really you realize that this was around 10 years ago though Matt do you not realise this and then I just ran yawn stat right and that's again one of these awesome things that that that now as soon as this whole server spins up and gets done building the initial build plane I just have this awesome Google local environment and we can start hacking away right in so this this demo obviously has little craft that we don't really need don't need some big react local do show pseudo code challenges I don't need a lamp that anymore let's get rid of this logo let's say having each one because I like having an each one on a pink bra though getting cheerleading from the plain old dog who stick here we go bang cool so we're spinning we have a name I think we'll need the header to be a little smaller it has like some big viewport wildenstein let's just get rid of that and do like a padding no fear I'm kind of interested to see that very quickly you're starting to work on the design of this as well I'm very much like instant gratification how can we best get something quickly that has something it's like totally him and especially when I'm trying to turn our project you'll also see me there's a bunch of stuff I would do differently from it for me like your project I had more time don't really think about like hey maybe I should use typescript right totally look into how hooks works to do things that way yes there's a bunch of stuff right but but when you I'd like a hackathon and you want to actually build something then I just find it it's really good to just rely and stuff you've done yeah build with what you know discovery no and and and split your time a bit between the time that's like hey now I'm learning new tools and experiencing and now I'm actually trying to get something was working right don't get it get it get it out there right source solace right now I'm very much and get something working mode right so the first thing I'll need to get anything working is to figure out how how the hell does this thing work and they it apparently has to make puzzles right but we need to sort of figure out what what does that make puzzle version do one of the things that I love in coding is the a very ripple idea I'm right like the runt run to run eval print loop there's this sort of brought forth and the browser to date this comes with an awesome one of those so my first aid really ugly dirty hack to get a little bit of it will be to import this generator from pseudo cool and then instead of using it for anything else you say like this is this is nothing don't try this at all I'll just expose it on the window update let's make a puzzle here we go Oh yummy ruin running right in so this was one thing that when I was / diving earlier it it it couldn't like it took me a while to figure this out and not be really really confused by it so it just to recap like a pseudo coup it's always like it's this grid like typically nine by nine right and then each row has to have all the numbers 1 to 9 each a column has to have all the numbers 1 to 9 and each square that's nine by nine has to has all the numbers 99 right in and if if we look and again this took me a while to reach I noticed right but if we look at what this specific NPM module outputs there's only zeros in here right so for some reason the author of this generator decided it was nice to have the number zero to eight instead of one to nine interesting choice for them now that I know it I won't spend a lot of time being very perplexed and on a couple of things to discover that is a good thing to just go before him right but now the next time I make the next thing like one of the things that I learned a lot from as a developer was working with Haskell for a while Haskell has this very strong type system and it's all about transformations of the types right in and in the beginning I was fighting a lot with that today I would really like that obviously I didn't pick typescript than anything so I'm not going to do anything that really deals with types but I am gonna start from thinking okay how do I want data to flow down through this application right so I know that I'll end up with with like an app that has some kind of pseudo keyboard and that board has some grows and those rows has some fields in them that that has a number that's either a readonly number that came from the from the puzzle or a non readonly number that that came from the user right so I want to think off the bed okay how can i how can I take this and generate something that that that comes with a data structure there dim in that that I can work really well with and how can I write right like JavaScript that activity is JavaScript it's another question right so I'll start by just generating the raw in pseudo Kuen I've just seen in my little rate ripple that in meek puzzle seems just do that job right so all that gives me is just like this long array of no structure whatsoever right like that's not really what I want to work with in I want to work with him just like now that I don't have added anything with the type system I can at least like document a little I like the attention to detail that's going on here okay I'm assuming that's cuz you're scared of tripping yourself up later yeah yeah and it's because I think that this is so fundamental like just thinking about the right data structures really really helps oh so what I'm thinking is that I'll have an array of rows and if there's Haskell is result all be types and stuff just like weird objects right like if it was typescript I might even turn it into two classes right so each of these so so probably I'll have like actually a base object that has some rows and each of those rows will be an object that has some columns I guess and then each of those columns in this Chris one thing I quickly found out I want to have it like the row ID and the column ID so we know what we're working on I wanted to have the actual value whatever it is right and then I want it and then then I want like a readonly property in that that tells us like is this a prefilled value that the youth like that they that can't be changed or is it something that can't be changed right so so this is probably an okay start for like the the the data structure it gives me four for each I I would actually add one thing I would add also here an index that just gives me a key because I know in later on when I'm building out this this UI tree which is really the way you should think about react right like you have like a root element and then you have data just flowing down you know through a three of components right I just know that I'm gonna he's for each rose that states the same for efficiency and so on right yeah so I know this is kind of like the initial data structure I want to come up with and then I could do like normally I'll do all kinds of fancy functional maps and so on but let's do something really basic and say okay so we want some result in that has some rows etc here and then for just to completely zero to nine right in one thing that can be a little confusing with with es6 is that kant's doesn't really mean that something is frozen in it it just means that it means that I can't reassign this variable but I can still mutate the object I didn't know that I might choose to use too late but I think my limbs are sending is right now welcome you know so we have this nine times nine you read right that we're just gonna use the very basic ing variable yes yeah right and the world friends and then this column is gonna be something that has like the role yeah generate and then the value will actually I think I like strike the value out here because clear well be the wrong one and then if I'm right it will be like I times nine to sort of navigate it in there rewrite like doing doing doing okay yes yes plus gay right if I'm right this is a team right to you thank you if we say if we have this if we take our little rebel or I did you play around right so if we have raw and we say okay we have the first column in the first one yeah like 0 times nine plus zero right like they will give us the first value yeah then let's see one two three four five six seven eight nine so if we had like still the first row and nine off that didn't get right actually okay yeah actually yeah because we're going from ceará Tory yes that's good right and then if we have the second element and the next row that would be something like this I know something like this you know before okay so it seems to increase reading interesting in I'll say this looks good and then read only right now it's actually as simple as if the value is not know exactly then it's a prefilled field setting this in the moments got you yeah so yeah and then at the end of this to make it useful we should probably return something oops okay in we have a problem still we should actually do something with this problem in okay here we go let's see okay complaints like we're not getting actually using this right makes sense because we're not using it so let's start by just this I know this like a more fencing yours it takes for this now but again Agathon do what you do a computer with confidence first and and don't worry in so let's say we set the stage and we just sit this rule to generate pseudo cool and now we have some state okay okay next job let's actually displace something yeah that would be lovely I always have is always a nice moment when something appears on the screen yeah so let's see let's create a suit so cool for yes him I'll do that by let's create a component folder in and add a pseudo COO board there and just get this boilerplate in there okay and then let's let's start with fair really yeah with the most basic proof of concept there would be something like yeah this this should at least show us if you know if we're doing anything where we will need to actually go and import our component great okay we have a bunch of stuff finished authorship amazing let's see let's start by filing like no now my really first goal right and I really like to write like work in small achievable goals that I can get towards them that gives me something right so my first goal should just be to display like and and the empty Sudoku on the screen that'll make me happy or sad yeah yeah so we know it's just this will savor some typing just stick track Doku and say okay we have cocoa and then we'll want to hear cool rose map so we'll just met over each of these rows and for each row will make last name sounds reasonable yeah and then for each of these rows we sort of have a set of columns yes we should also react will complain you know no no it's really nice that I had this index rate because now we can actually sit he will and then here I think what we actually want here is sort of like a field right that that allows us to do input yes and and so on so I'll make a new component for that and call it in a field I don't know it's a little weird if column field but I'm not know is agate anything in so I will do this and I'll you see this the column actually not maybe I like to call this a field here even if sure because then we have like the row index and the column index in makes sense in we also have typos and let's do this now we need to actually create yep and then we can think about how do we want to render a field and it could be like from static could be as easy as just an input shoe last name field and the value would just be the let's do this again just be like this right and then we can even sit should it be readonly I actually react this vehicle is reminding me that's like some reason apiece I would trip me up every single time I think yeah okay so we still need to actually import this one so this is really nice while you're doing this and you're working away since you've got a build running which is like well do coding isn't doing you know yeah keeping everything refreshed yeah you can actually even without switching context okay so yeah I'm constantly getting this feedback right which results are just right again ten years ago this was not as smooth and of course cults it's not a function it's what I want to do is men over the car okay this is starting to look like something right like let's go big and just tweet this is this a little bit when you you've got it's not even just a list of things it is a grid it's great values are going in in the right places yes that's it that feels like a big step to me yeah yeah if I was really good I would like make it oh this is already starting to give this hitter a little knocking awesome maybe maybe make those numbers a little larger yeah in and actually like let's make let's do phonce thank you to look like something and then let's take all the read only ones and let's say when then when when it's the one you winter we make them like a little you know light and then when it's the read only one we make it back in let's see okay now you now we have something resembling this to the group board at least rate like so so that's a that's a stat yeah ideally I mean like that that's sort of we intrigued that later right like ideally we also wanted to create as well right again this mean something yeah for tasks like this where the bigger part of this is the logic in actual yeah another team yeah yeah that's the place to go first then we can precisely right so this is a really typical first thing okay now let's see okay I have something now right like and and note some of the things I did for example like up here right like it's pretty obvious that this is not going to be the right place where this function should should live yeah that's something when I'm like starting out getting something working getting out I often really like just putting something in the same file assign me in and and because that's like the most trivial refactoring in the world ever to like put that into its own little component and pull it in right but but right when I'm just playing around it it's it can become like a bit of a stream of consciousness the way I'm thinking of doing the whole in one place before you go and optimize things make tidy things up and get them get them refactored cause the oh you're actually gonna push this at this moment and this is this is something I've been as I've been walking around the teams during the day and seeing how they've been working since they're many people working together yeah it was really nice to see that people have fairly quickly reached a point that they're they're sharing code together in a repo and they're sharing progress so as different people are making making commits they're pushing and pushing them up to the project that is rebuilding in exactly the same way that you know you're doing now and people can share the progress they can see how they're getting on and it's it's living and breathing right from the outset so it's really nice to be able to share these results and get them get them on a on a URL yeah I really agree I mean if I was a bit more of a team I would even do this with full requests and sure yeah [Laughter] well I just push this live and again and anyone following should in a moment be able to actually go to Sue's and get a random sodoku right in so now we should maybe start figuring out like you should probably not be oh yes things like this and there should be some indication of where you're at and so on each time you refresh that page is that giving you a new Sudokus yes and yeah because with this generated yeah in the constructor of the app right we're just doing and generate pseudo pollution now we actually already have a publicfacing like pseudo code generator and we're right like that took me a lot longer and we've come a long way yeah precisely right so so let's see let's think about okay now now we start having data travelling down right so so this was really want to talked about okay make make this data structure think about how its structured so we can easily have it propagate down a tree of your own Android and we have this very logical tree like system now now of course when when I do edits here and so on right we need to be able to have data travel back up in propagate up right so in here in our field I think will already see the console is saying hey why are you setting a value when a that's null and and the wire you're not having like any callbacks on your field so first to make this one a little heavy we'll do this and we'll have values that no no and then it's saying like yeah why don't you have an unchanged handler because you're setting a value you're not sitting in him so we should of course sitting in so we want to do some unchanged in let's handle change in and change in handler here in and which probably just say so now now we are starting to presume okay like since we're not going to be using any fancy state management or something which is going to be propagating just stayed up and down in reacting this is something that you could do if like hooks a reduction and so on but but I like studying this really simple right yes I understand and then unchanged what we want to do is that we want to take their their the current field and then we want to update the value to be a new value now we probably want to clean up that value a little bit so we want to see okay that value we we want to make sure we kind of pass this into an integer even if it comes from from from lake each of these fields those will be strengths we type in right now just absolutely but but we want to keep like again we want to think as if we had a type system right you think okay the value should definitively not sometimes be a string and sometimes be an integer yeah in so want to propagate up this value now here we have like a problem because what if the value is actually empty in in so what if it's just the empty string then we just want to accept that and otherwise we want to try to pass it into an int yeah in this like this is like an okay stat now we can propagate this up so now we should pass down some handlers in so here we want to pass down here we actually probably just want to assume because the good thing is that with the data structure we had right like if we go back and look at yeah every single field has like the row and column and so on right so so when we get like an updated value here it's it's easy to at the very top level go in and and and find the right field to actually it it yes so here we can just assume that we're getting pests down some event handler and see on change or something like that what's that wait I called it yeah yeah this props unchanged yet so we'll just assume here that we also has like an unchanged handle oppressed in here and then we should actually write an unchanged handler in that we can pass in here right it's amazing to see how quickly it pays dividends just when you were like thinking about your data structure yeah yeah you might kind of sketch that somewhere you might would it be actually putting it right there in the code yeah this would also be kind of shared around if you were working with someone else a team and you and you can refer back to that thinking and it's kind of it I mean it's not just the process of writing that helps you internalize it but also we've got that reference straightaway and you've been you've been making use of it right away this change and yeah it has a call in something right and I should do with some kind of this sit state within your state but this is where this is where I quickly feel like oh that's a lot of state to to handle if it's like all mutating and like how do I make sure that it's not some weird conditions going on and then fortunately the other day is Sean weighing from from our team wrote this great post on our blog about EEMA yeah which which is really really cool library so so in when it comes to another inspiration from from sort of Haskell world and so on it's this whole idea of immutable data structures Yeah right like and and and of having data that doesn't change in you you you take like one value and then you take a new value yes you don't your own change is a progression of a value of something it's a it's it's always like a transformation from my setup values to another right and mr is really cool like they have some great illustrations you have of these kind of transformations but it's a really cool way of doing it in waste with without really having to learn like immutable Gaia's or some different kind of data structure or anything like that so now I edit immer and then I'll import let me just see how they do it import produce from Emma and then we'll do a little trick here so we'll say okay produce from this let's see if this works basically the the way mr does it is that it has this little producer take some initial state and then it and then it returns a function for updating that state and and inside that function you can pretend that the state is mutable but but everything ends up being a immutable nice let me just first see if I if I'm breaking everything now I can see that there's some I'm definitely missing yeah here we go okay so now we're back again we have exactly the same state with the difference that Emmer in my turns this into sort of a proxy object and so on so now this state is immutable I can't actually accidentally change it and this means that she and my in my handle change right like on the EMA site they'll have some good example of a fusing instead of this traditional way of saying okay now I need to like sort of unpack this whole object and put it together again yeah I can just call produce and take the state modify it and and Emma will handle that hold so I can go in here and say it's state and say produce and then take a function that takes the current state and then it just it just mutate it in here it does actually do mutation but it's not in it's not that painful so we have these rows and then from our element we have like the row ID and now we'll have some columns and then we'll have our collide E and that will have a value that now we want to update boom let's see yep's I can't do things and I can't type now you can see I can type in E yeah right right for those that don't can see it I'm desperately trying to put similar to my pseudo queue right now and and I can't I can only put in numbers now right so now we already got this this data flow work that's fantastic that's yeah that takes us such a long way in such a short time we use about you can tell you just like again like building these kind of things ten years ago in the browser which is so hot right and now now you have this really clear state abstraction all the state is just flowing down a tree it's immutable we understand where it's coming from and so on right now next thing I want to do is is start checking if the pseudo quiz has been solved or not and this is one thing I realized when I was doing like it like playing around with this earlier and that is that I'm not very good at solving you should anymore spend an hour building as so I'm gonna cheat a little writer like I'm gonna I'm gonna add a little button with an unclick and learn that this is the flip to the back of the stoker book button so you can see the solution and then we are gonna make a pseudo code handler here and let's see so one of the things we want kind of anyway I think in already when we when we generate our structure up here is actually we probably also want to to keep the solution around right yeah because like we we need to actually be able to verify yes if you're doing the right wrong right yeah it's not no reason to keep doing that and we have this solve puzzle thing yeah again I've exposed it to my little cheating ripple right you know we have this tulip that's across all in so I can do this right and then we can say generator is solve puzzle puzzle and see oh this one is the sweet sweet the same one but just with the results right so here we'll just say generator and we will immediately take stuff possible and say okay solve the puzzle and story that's the solution and then the other thing I would probably start doing is writing a little chick tech solution or something in passing that should up with structure and then we need to sort of now now we have these and we kind of want to unwrap them again yeah probably say okay we have something like a candidate for solution mmm and then we take the pseudo ku rose yes we map over each row for each row we take the columns remember where each column we take the value and in modern JavaScript it's like nice enough that we can just say okay and then just make it a flattery yep so now we're back and we have a structure that's the same so now we can just start again really simple just say and then this like a really you see first chick which is like if the candidate if the candidate value is equal to an empty string um we scrape out of that I did way I tell you what's it ignore it's actually not right could we actually do that we should probably again we should keep it really strongly type yes so we should actually make this same null because otherwise which sometimes have strengths and sometimes and all and we really old like that try to miss with Haskell right like you can so easily mix up your types but we want to keep it really straight to type right so if it's no then we know that we we don't need to take it you know it can be your salt yet right in or if the value here is not exactly equal to the to the sued aqua solution then we should return false right then there's no reason to go I guess more pieces right and if we make it all the way through and we haven't return false which you say yes great so now we have a function for checking his solution in in this is the this where's the point where it's like oh how it was sold so am I actually kind of trying to solve one of these just to figure out if that function works right ideally I would have set up like some test suite in something like this is what I'm missing now my party in there would be by two maybe if I had more than an hour if this was like a reading project there is definitively set up some way of running tests right like that would make it so easy to to write a little field test of that frightened and see if it actually makes sense instead we will write a function to magically self in in a way in your ruining sodoku for everyone on you let's see what are we gonna do in to magically solve this I guess we can run through well one it will run us some somehow like take each of these and find the right value yes yeah and so I guess we can actually just like do something similar and say in this stage Doku and then just for each row take the row and then for in the columns for each column take that one and then in here we'll just want to see in if it's not out we okay actually we will really make sure we do this with with our mr produce right because we want to actually update the state through the salt so you're right you'll be doing this same trick of seeing okay let's take the stage inside produce and then and then inside here we can do all of these nice mutations mmhmm why you can't so if it's not a readonly column then set the column value to in there's stage cool solution and then we have the same at some point we should probably make some helper method to that right but we have the same kind of local function where we say okay in column row times nine plus column I think she's that right oh there's a new age of the candidates right in the first thing is that value is not defined and light forty year now we have this room that didn't work very well in regional aim because I'm trying to do in the actual up gauge let's see where was it 71 I want to do this for each rooms ready so I'm just running over you troll and interact look quite right so there's something something is not right in Atlantis so is that are those zeros so we've got early is this a tripod that it's actually a really good point yeah because up here yeah that's a really good point yeah there's actually both the point so did we ever correct I'm not seeing any zeros here so we did fix it in the me class on the world okay yeah it's totally the zeroes that are creating an issue right notice how we're never seeing any zeros again this is this is the this is a gun show of type on type languages right here saying if if and zero matches and yeah so the first thing we want to do is probably to right let's see let's see if we start getting some lines yeah okay great but also that makes me feel more at ease sing nested okay with the right number and we can write navigate around there kind of type issue the solution will always have one so let's just just say like this so about here can I read frozen hmm just picking this apart and yeah Oh haha old friend our friend cancel lock okay it did it did lock something out earlier up the page isn't it spot what it was there we go now he's up there somewhere yeah it's not okay that actually yeah we can't do this because now because the self person in expect the format or the the raw format a well so it's like a little annoyance here oh that's a shame that would he was getting such a tidy solutions yeah yeah that's a shame but that that that this mean that we might want it yeah it's awfully annoying okay I'm gonna do a quick okay okay now now we have this something who is because we are saying nines now as well so we are seeing nines now right like now it's probably just this mapping of of rows and columns that are some ago right when we when we say okay let's solve this yeah is again this is where just wheat would be life yeah absolutely mmhmm so this is the state before in the solution so the solution here three seven one three six two and then it's something it's something related to it not just keep just giving these readonly or something like that let's okay okay now we now we have this solid matically button in okay so there was a sudden out now we now now now we know we can we can solve these pseudo crews very fast yeah in and now we can start is saying okay whenever we handle this change we should also have some function to you need to see if it's old oh yeah something like that right where I'm just going to see okay first of all I'm probably gonna introduce like assault yeah we could even we're gonna introduce some more we could say like okay up here when when we create the pseudo chrome maybe we want to say okay we have these roads we have this solution we have this that time which is a new page we started it now we can have the result hey somebody were recycling precisely okay so we have a start time in a stall time right and then here in okay this is this is all the same then and then here we can say okay if first of all we can we can start by checking because if we've already sorted you just never be wearing em yeah but if if it's solved in and we if we don't have a soft time we can say okay hold it up here check solution and we can pass in actually realizing that we'll probably want this to be a part of our state change here and that means we don't really want it to be a handler because we'll get some weird race condition degree when she is passing State okay so we're gonna see okay is it is it gonna be solved in by sitting up here it's just that before we extract it to anonymous yeah later it's now in theory we should start setting a soft time if the pseudocode has been sold huh now we're passing this in so maybe in here in our board we can go in and see right borders actually yeah that's that's a curious effect and okay let's see why we didn't solve it in with the logic intensely detecting if it had been solved or just just the reporting of it couldn't quite so basically here we should be checking if it had in salt and I mean that is the function we haven't quite checked it yet so we again [Laughter] it's not happening right right is our handler running is I change Honduran even firing and that I do think it is yeah but it's double check yep yeah it's probably people screaming at the life so it's obviously the condition here in oh oh in that's just that the short time so up here yeah this is because we are setting the soft time to keep it so there'll be this weird thing where I need to go into yep this was and now we detect okay you solve this okay so that's so that so that's great then while we're not solving it will obviously want to show some kind of timer right right in so let's make a little timer component let's figure out how a timer should behave it's gonna start to feel pretty pretty complete in terms of the functionality is that point I think yeah yeah populating it will be a check to see if it's old yes to watch for the entry even though we're cheating to populate it but we'll be able to report if it's old or not and if we if this time is updating as well it sounds like it's a that's gonna be good to push so typically in the timer it's like hmm it's useful to hit some state that that's maybe later second sit elapsed starting at zero in and and let's see forgetting the new a fancier life cycle methods but we'll just do this when it mount will say sit just good old JavaScript sitting in inducing using sit stage to just say a elapsed is now let's see how we do it I'm expecting to pair since that time that's a date mmhmm so we all want to say we're going to take the time right now and subtract the time from date and then this is going to be milliseconds so we want to get it in seconds and then we want to round down soon I have some weird like because people don't tend to think in milliseconds I mean I love the optimism that we're gonna be reporting this in seconds I was thinking like like days or serious you duck food solvers right like this is hit hard or challenge okay now we have this time whether we should probably try to show it something yeah we also ought to do what's called component too well unmount or something you can say even to listener you're hanging and then here no board we can import a timer yeah oops something good you know typos in that I just I just fulfilled my value is the pair okay so we only want to show that we don't have the final time right I think we called it like that no yep there we go nice we have a time you have a time right now with it and then hearing the result like so maybe we should actually make that a little component in the self and say okay we have some little result component that will show what what happens right yeah okay and then we'll return little things here but what what I want is what I want to do here is something similar to the timer I want to get that elapsed time right so yeah so in the result we will have they're all half there right now I'm just gonna pitch in and then we'll want to have like it laps to be in same calculation right I don't want to take this you don't cool a solve time and take the millisecond snip and then subtract its that time and we'll want it yeah and then that's good and let's get it on the board it's the excitement isn't it yes I am I'm a horrible and slow type I know in general honestly right like it's it's a and I'm super like some people really like a very very punch speakers about how fast they can use the editors and so on and I'm I've never really been obsessing over this it's pretty likely this is you've been moving quite quickly I've shown yeah all right okay let's see well actually have to cheat a little right like and you know fill this in yes all this weirdo point in seven seconds oh nice nice okey I think this warrants like cleaning up some consoling and committing great I think yeah this feels like functionally does exactly what what we would have set out to do yeah so now we have like the the basic outfit right like I will probably extract this so you get rid of this at some point I would really yeah I actually check this an NPM import Konami [Laughter] okay and then I mean then then we could go in and do more things so we could wrap it up right like so now we have this basic thing right like what I did in my original challenge which which is actually not a big step up from this but but is to say okay so so let's say we we've been working on this for a while and I've solved this in 41 seconds yeah now how about that I could send you this very same pseudo cool yes and say like hey now you saw right in in in these seconds right but at the moment this is being generated like a fresh with every every single time it is right so we can actually do something pretty quick to get around and just to give you a concept of how we can make it shareable right you know so this is really basic and that especially secure anything but but but just to see like it's not the end of the world at people in so now I'm am gonna go and take this stuff here and put it into its own little library mmhm it starts becoming a little messy to have it out there let's export this generate pseudo cool that export this check solution and let's go here and then import generate pseudo cool and check solution from now we are back again right so one of the things we would want to use yeah because I'm calling generator generate pseudo coo and we just want to call okay it because up here I'm talking about a generator and we haven't actually important we haven't actually imported the NPM tsuyoku right here we go okay so now we've begged in right and basically what we need to be able to send someone the challenge is some form of URL yeah with this ruku in it right so we can say okay in let's have some share URL that we can generate for pseudocode this first step right in and basically we'll we'll want some data in that URL that's like hey let's get that in let's basically get what this one is generating right like that make puzzle right so let's get this raw one in there right maybe we want to keep now we now we've multiplied everything so maybe we're gonna keep it around here so just so we have it for generating there the data here right you know in so we want that we probably also want some more right we want who should we send the pseudocode to yeah to be able to well not in the URL yeah yeah we didn't so this one went through right when you actually sent this meal if we don't have a database or something we want that URL to also have who do we send it from and who do we send it to so once you're done we can send it to the one that oh wow so this is just like going a little bit but we probably we can start without decent even if we just said we could not good we can we can use your own right in the basis of you yeah so what we'll have in the data room and let's take that data and say okay we'll have the roster Doku in then we will want this that time mmhmm and we'll want the soft time right because those two will want to to verify right a then a really handy thing is that all the browsers now again this is something that they didn't you said right buddy they have these two functions and I always forget which one they switch it to be and Beach way in so it should be it be 2 a1 visa for base64 encoding of our strings these are these are built in to build into the browser's I know right and it's so easy now right like you just say okay Jason stringify data repertory and now you have like now we have like a query string with all of this just encoded in the query right and then we can do something like like returning the document location a truth in we want to make sure we don't end up with a lot of core strings I'm just gonna do some replace like this is really quick and dirty right but I'm just gonna say whoops what did Mitchell code tried to help me with that I'm just gonna say okay if there is a query string everything then remove it and then you add like the pseudo cool is super crafty like that okay now we have a share URL in itself that's not gonna help us super much apart from like what are we going to do with it right so yourself actually decode that yeah so we have we have to get some kind of like up here we'll want to check are we getting this raw one from the generator are we getting it from this year URL yeah are we getting and now we're getting some so we'll want something like from your something like this right and then we can write this function extract URL data and we can say okay here we go let's first see in so this will give us the query param and then it's a it's one of those in three honest we could even do a check right now we don't have a query parameter levels I know you put I thought you said oka was the query parameter yeah yeah I just mean like here we always see in the browser so I just wanted to make sure okay we have a string so then we can just let let's do let's do even just do a match so you know like this is gonna be really a brute force let's bring not ampersand okay that's where one and if we get a match then we know we have a URL in here it'll return know if we don't have one and if we have one here we can see okay so the first value is this one so now we just want to do with the you need to be and we want to do with adjacent on that value in this way I wish it had started with a just framework because it would make it so much easier but I don't well sometimes you sometimes you're leasing the wrong place yeah but okay now now we can both like share URL and we can extract this royalty and up here we can say okay if we extract this then we could say from URL if we already have the URL then just take the raw value from there in other ways you here and then this is exactly the same this is the same this is the same and then we just want sort of their Challenger that time and Challenger all the time college okay so now in theory we should have all the information to know if there's a challenger in the URL and so on yes now we should just to figure out like okay if we actually solve this Sudoku in we should also update the pseudocode with this year URL and we'll want to import what we call the function the ship we just called it share URL we did yeah there's okay so here we go we take they share your L and can read it from ours so what's the right signature right yep okay so now in theory we have a URL that we can start sharing so now it's just up to us and our result here to say okay you solve this in these seconds and then see ya it challenge yeah friends want enemy and I know why would do that but still aim and it'll be a little silly because it'll just open in your browser this way no one can get in so then it would just be listed of course yeah right now and we're gonna find out yeah let's take that okay so let's see it's it's totally cheat right and then and then somewhere get a shilling great like I can copy this link address and and send it to you you and then I can remove the magic button and yeah and here you go right like let's let's see if this actually so did this actually no it it didn't pick the right room so let's figure out why why we didn't now but now we have now we have like an easy test case here right like we have this one over here in well it will change the students I update stuff then that that's the one piece library though sometimes um but in let's see why don't we get this we do have this rhetorical query string and I think I think I know because we are doing this wrong cool yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think we are almost there now right like I think we're actually gonna get this this ready right so so let's see I'm gonna open this share link it's it's it's all your changes oh well I mean I think we're pretty much there right like I think this is this one okay look at the match no no this does seem like it should be right No yeah yeah we are getting we're getting all the right stuff so we are we not using it I mean this actually seems right we are showing the right one and you will see that now in this one we are getting this let's see if I think we're just looking at the wrong one let's let's let's let's see if we're just like in okay let's see in four to five seven mm nope no so why are we getting the wrong one so the problem then must be with not with that but with the share URL it seems like right we actually we are we certainly using it when we yeah it seems like we're sitting the wrong data here yeah it's so close right we look at the URL what's the shelling that we actually yeah so this was and and and I did have that like we don't have this process here right like and you can see it's right one and we can see that we are setting the same every to you in hmm okay something is wrong when we solve it and so the problem might actually be the magic solver function that misses something up it's gonna wind up being that the easiest way to test it is to manually solve the Sudoku No okay so the problem the problem is totally there there we it is actually our manual I think everything is working except for this cheating function I think so I think so okay well I mean well it feels like we're we're within so I will I will I'll do this okay okay and then I would like to say that that that without that the religions without the cheat if I could solve this the main issue being back would be to actually here in in the result in handle a case where where where where we have one right like so in so here we would just have and this we won't have time to to test now in him but we had this field called the Challenger is salt time right so in this result we can go in and see in if there is a challenge assault time yeah then maybe put a little h3 here saying your opponent solved in and yeah we don't want to do that little piece of math up here and exam yes seems like something that should be extracted into its own method in because this is like well that's that's the way it works with getting something together quickly getting the steel thread yeah getting it working yeah then we can yes we can then we can optimize right like there's a bunch of things we could we did we could make smooth all right I think this is gonna be our last piece of functionality yeah it is it is okay and then we can say your opponents opted in and we have okay okay in theory this is in theory this is our fully working through double challenge that we can share I'll commit this yeah in tandem yeah once we Justice a nice I love the I love that combination message working working solution it's this thing it's my it's my way of saying yeah thank you love working but hey I think we're in good shape I think yeah barring the fact that you have to actually go through yes yeah you have to actually solve this yeah that given because I think that I can really get that magic button through to to work again oh okay I like it as is I like the fact there's integrity to it it means the people that solve it but this is kind of remarkable so I mean we went a little over the how that we were chatting away everyone can still in an hour and twenty minutes we've gone from zero to having this kind of functionality in place it's been deployed out onto the web it's the kind of thing that now you can actually get get a shared URL is finishing his build right now as we speak its function is zero to functional in a little over an hour with chatting and yeah and and my help so that's amazing I think is the perfect perfect place to to close it it's kind of remarkable what what can be achieved in that amount of time I mean it's not just the tools were looking at here with like the with net the fight getting out and deployed but also the the modern capabilities of the browsers we have things that I was seeing there that I wasn't aware of and little utilities though I wish we had known about but also that the tools that we have in things like react and libraries that have in NPM what a wealth of resources they're in the hands of developers now is kind it's kind of incredible it isn't variable right this there's been fun for me because I basically built in in a now I'm miners like the one little legging component and it's like setting up a little lamp the function and sending a mail back and forth and so on right buddy yeah but that's that's actually a pretty trivial amount of work I did a little experiment before with me I'll gone right and and it's it's pretty girl right and and to see that that this can just pretty easily be built in an hour and deployed globally and like shared and and and done with like this kind of workflow in anything right like that that's just such a huge difference from 10 years ago when I was when I was building the same time you're being in in Ruby and rails and on dreamhost or something like that and and trying to make it run at all it's pretty remarkable Matt thanks so much for spending the time to do that and braving the challenge remarkably no biting stuff very easy
