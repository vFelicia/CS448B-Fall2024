With timestamps:

00:00 - What is up everybody, my name is Heath Adams and 
I welcome you to this course called Linux for  
00:06 - ethical hackers. So in this course, we're going to 
be covering a lot of things, we're really going to  
00:11 - be going in hammering down on the terminal and 
the command line. And if you've never learned  
00:15 - Linux before, this is a really great start for 
you, especially if you're interested in becoming  
00:20 - Ethical Hacker or a penetration tester. So enough 
of my face. Let's go ahead and just dive right in.  
00:26 - Alright, everyone, welcome to this course titled 
Linux for ethical hackers. Before we get started,  
00:32 - I'd like to do a little Who am I so my name is 
Heath Adams. I also go by the cyber mentor. I am  
00:40 - a husband, first a hacker, a military veteran, 
gamer sports fan and animal Dad, I am a former  
00:49 - accountant turned security geek. So I've been in 
cybersecurity about three years now. And before  
00:55 - that, I was an accountant, I hated it pick that 
that field for all the wrong reasons. So once I  
01:02 - went into it, and cybersecurity, I never looked 
back. And I've never been happier. On the day to  
01:07 - day, I am a senior security engineer. I'm also a 
business owner at TCM security. So before that I  
01:15 - was a senior penetration tester doing penetration 
testing and ethical hacking, I branched out  
01:20 - and started my own business focusing on ethical 
hacking, training and student development. So now  
01:27 - I'm doing that full time, along with a job as a 
senior security engineer. Okay, so let's go ahead  
01:35 - and talk about what we'll learn in this course. So 
this course is going to be all hands on. Besides  
01:42 - this little introduction here, you're not going 
to see a lot of PowerPoint besides quick overview  
01:47 - of what the course or the video that you're 
about to see has coming. So 95% hands on course,  
01:54 - I will not kill you with PowerPoint. That's not 
my goal. We're going to be focusing on Kali Linux  
01:59 - this entire course, and really learning Linux 
and learning Linux for the purpose of becoming  
02:05 - ethical hackers. So we're going to install VMware, 
which is a virtualized software, virtualization  
02:12 - software, and then we're going to run Kali Linux 
inside of VMware. After that, I'm going to give  
02:17 - you a overview of Kali Linux, show you some of the 
common tools, what it can do, why it's awesome.  
02:22 - And then we're going to do a deep dive into the 
terminal. So what that means is we're going to  
02:28 - be hands on doing commands and learning Linux. 
So we'll be running, navigating the file system.  
02:36 - So how to get around in the file system from the 
terminal, we'll learn about users and privileges,  
02:41 - how to add users how to what kind of privileges 
and permissions are there what important files  
02:47 - exist regarding those, we're going to talk about 
common network commands. So if you want to be a  
02:52 - pen, tester, or ethical hacker, you need to know 
networking, at least at a basic minimum. So we'll  
02:59 - talk about those common network commands that you 
should know how to run them what they do, we'll  
03:03 - talk about viewing, creating and editing files. 
That's obviously important if you want to create  
03:07 - a quick file or edit a file from the command line, 
how you can do that. We'll talk about starting and  
03:13 - stopping services such as a web server, SSH, 
SQL database, etc. We're going to talk about  
03:20 - how to install updates, how to install tools 
and how to update those tools. And then lastly,  
03:26 - we're going to put everything we learned together 
and do some scripting in bash. So we're going to  
03:31 - write a basic bash script, and then we'll improve 
upon it and then I'll show you some four loops,  
03:37 - some other logical scripting ideas, and then 
we'll kind of put that together and hopefully,  
03:43 - come to a nice completion when it's all said and 
done. So with all this being said, I'm excited  
03:50 - to have you in the course with me, I look forward 
to teaching you and let's go ahead and start with  
03:56 - installing VMware. Alright, the first thing that 
we're going to need to do is to install software  
04:03 - called VMware Workstation player. Now we have two 
ways to run Kali Linux, we can either run Kali  
04:12 - Linux through a virtual machine, or we can install 
it as an operating system on a hard drive for this  
04:19 - course, and this lesson, we're going to be using a 
virtual machine. and preferably, we're going to be  
04:24 - using VMware Workstation player. I'm going to show 
you how to install VMware Workstation player and  
04:30 - I'll show you some of the alternatives to it as 
well. So let's go ahead and dive right in. Okay,  
04:37 - so if you go out to the interweb, and you go to 
Google, and you type in VMware Workstation player,  
04:44 - the first thing that will come up for you is 
this download VMware Workstation player link.  
04:50 - You're going to go ahead and just click on this 
and now I also want to introduce alternatives. So  
04:59 - there is a another software platform called Oracle 
VirtualBox. And you will be able to install either  
05:06 - my preference in the course that's going to be 
taught the rest of the way through is going to be  
05:11 - in VMware Workstation Pro. But we will use player 
for the install, you'll be able to follow along  
05:17 - with player you will also be able to follow along 
with Oracle VirtualBox if you so choose. But we  
05:23 - will not be showing that installation. Another 
thing that should be noted is there is this  
05:28 - comparison page here and I will be using VMware 
Workstation Pro. There's a nice little checklist  
05:35 - here that shows what pro can do versus player, he 
has a lot of the same features here. Some of the  
05:41 - nice things is running multiple VMs at once. You 
can technically do that with VMware Workstation  
05:46 - player, there's workarounds for it. But to have 
it in a single tabbed interface. It's very,  
05:52 - very nice. You see here, the drag will tabbed 
interface. That's another feature snapshots.  
05:58 - So basically making a backup of your machine all 
included in workstation Pro. So if you have some  
06:05 - money to shell out, and this is something 
that you're interested in doing long term,  
06:09 - it may be worth looking into a workstation pro 
license, but by all means you can get away with  
06:16 - a workstation player installation, and that's 
exactly what we're going to do. So let's go back  
06:21 - to the first tab here. And you can see it says 
try VMware Workstation player, we're just going  
06:28 - to scroll down and this install and everything 
is going to be running on top of windows for  
06:33 - me. If you're installing for Linux, that's fine 
as well just follow your instructions for your  
06:38 - respective OS. Go ahead and select Download now. 
I'm going to save the file. Okay, it downloaded  
06:46 - I'm going to hit run. It's going to ask if we want 
to accept the changes, yes. Okay, now we're going  
07:00 - to hit Next we'll accept the license agreement and 
possibly give away our firstborn. I'm going to go  
07:09 - ahead and check yes, for the enhanced keyboard 
driver. We don't need to check for product update,  
07:18 - we don't need to join the VMware customer 
experience improvement. We'll hit Next on that,  
07:22 - you can leave both of these checked or check 
to your preference. And then hit install. And  
07:29 - while this is installing, I can actually show you 
what VMware pro looks like. This is a pro instance  
07:38 - running here you can see they have the tabs and 
they're draggable as it was notated in that,  
07:43 - that differential spreadsheet that you saw, and 
I've got a Cali instance running, that's actually  
07:49 - my main Cali machine. I've got windows 10 running 
here. And this is all actually sitting on top of  
07:55 - a real windows 10 machine as well. So we're just 
installing workstation player, I'm going to run a  
08:01 - VM inside of a VM. So this can be a little bit of 
Vm ception here, and then we're just going to hit  
08:06 - finish. And then we are going to restart this 
machine as it needs a reboot real quick. Okay,  
08:16 - now we are restarted and we're back to our desktop 
here, you can see that VMware Workstation player  
08:22 - has been added to the desktop. Let's just go ahead 
and double click that to open it. And we're going  
08:29 - to choose to use VMware Workstation 15 player for 
free for non commercial use. If we wanted the pro  
08:36 - edition, we would enter in our access key here 
license key and continue on with the pro edition.  
08:44 - And now we will use the Finish button 
here and we will be brought to our VMware  
08:49 - Workstation 15 player. So you can see here 
that it's a much different view, it's very,  
08:55 - very basic. We have the option to open a VM here 
and we'll have the one VM stored in this tab that  
09:03 - we can open up and that'll be it. There are ways 
around running multiple VMs at the same time,  
09:10 - but if you're looking to build a fluid lab out and 
have multiple VMs running similar to what I have  
09:15 - here, having the VMware pro again, it does have 
its benefits here. So you can see this is a much  
09:23 - much different look. This is very generic as we we 
can see here. So from here, what we're going to do  
09:30 - is we're going to go ahead and stop in the next 
video, we are going to focus on downloading Kali  
09:36 - Linux and we'll talk about what Kali Linux is 
and some of its features as well. So I'll catch  
09:43 - you over in the next video. Alright, now let's 
move on to installing Kali Linux in our VMware  
09:50 - software. Okay, so picking up where we left off we 
had just installed VMware Workstation 15 player,  
09:57 - and now we need a VM to actually be able to play 
with it. So this whole course is going to be based  
10:04 - on Kali Linux. If we open up a internet browser 
here, I've got a few tabs already opened. So what  
10:13 - I want you to do is go ahead and go out to Google, 
and just type in Cali k L, I Linux download,  
10:20 - and leave it here. What we're going to do as well 
is I want to talk just a quick second about what  
10:27 - Kali Linux is. So Kali, Linux is a Debian based 
Linux OS. So it's based on pen testing tools,  
10:39 - and it's made for pen testers. So what it 
does is it comes preloaded with a bunch of  
10:45 - penetration testing tools, a toolkit, if you will 
call it and it is just made for people who are  
10:52 - looking to do pen testing. So this is provided 
by offensive security. If you come to cali.org.  
11:00 - And you look at the About Us, it provides a little 
bit of information about who the core developers  
11:05 - were and some of the moderators. But basically, 
what it is, is it followed up a tool called or  
11:13 - distribution called backtrack. So the new the new 
tool is Kali Linux. Now there are alternatives out  
11:20 - there. One of the alternatives right now is called 
parrot. So if you go to parrot sec.org, and you  
11:28 - look into what is parrot, you can see that they 
have different distributions. And they talk about  
11:34 - why parrots different, but they do have a pen test 
distribution here. So for this course, we're going  
11:40 - to be using Kali Linux, but I always do like to 
introduce the alternatives. Kali Linux is probably  
11:47 - more popular at this point, parrot OS is kind of 
on the newer side, some people are starting to  
11:53 - get behind it and liking it, but I would say Kali 
still dominates. The third option is that you set  
12:00 - up your own distribution. So you have an OS that 
you like, and then you install the tools on the  
12:07 - OS that you like, and you have your own custom 
build. So some people feel like, you know, Kali,  
12:12 - or even parrot, they come with a bunch of tools 
that they'll never need. So their systems bloated,  
12:17 - and they really just have a set amount of tools 
that they like, and if there's a tool that they  
12:22 - want to add into the system, then they'll download 
that on their own. They don't want to have a ton  
12:27 - of bloatware coming with their system. But with my 
experience in the industry, mostly everybody that  
12:34 - I've worked with is using Kali Linux, some people 
are doing their own builds, especially on like the  
12:40 - webapp pen testing side. And then now parrot is 
kind of that up and coming Oh s that some people  
12:46 - are transitioning to, but it is predominantly Kali 
Linux. So that is why we're doing this course in  
12:53 - Kali Linux. And I feel like it's the best option 
for us to learn some, just some basic Linux  
12:59 - skills and learning in the OS that is the most 
dominant in the industry right now. So let's go  
13:06 - ahead and go back to that Kali Linux download. 
In while this link has been clicked on, do not  
13:12 - let it fool you. We're actually not clicking 
on the official Kali Linux downloads page,  
13:16 - we're going to scroll down a little bit, I want 
to go to the Kali Linux custom image downloads  
13:21 - page and I'll show you why here. So this is that 
offensive dash security Comm. Make sure that's the  
13:27 - one you're following along with. And if you scroll 
down just a bit, you see that they're providing us  
13:34 - VMware images and VirtualBox images. So remember, 
when I told you that VirtualBox was an option,  
13:39 - if you chose that option, here you go right here, 
you'll click on this tab and you will download the  
13:44 - VirtualBox image. Now what we're going to be 
doing is we're going to be running Kali Linux,  
13:49 - VMware 64 bit and we're going to download this 
seven zip right here. You also have the option  
13:56 - to download a torrent if you'd like the file 
size is going to be 2.4 gigs. So it might take  
14:03 - you a minute depending on your your speed of your 
internet. And they also provide a Sha 256 some if  
14:12 - you want to check the file when you download it. 
So I'm going to go ahead and just hit download  
14:16 - on this. And I'm going to save it and I will come 
back as soon as this file is finished downloading.  
14:23 - Okay, so my file has finished downloading, I'm 
going to navigate to the folder where it has  
14:28 - downloaded to which is the Downloads folder. 
And you can see here that is a seven zip file.  
14:35 - So my installation by default does not have seven 
zip. If you do not have seven zip either. We can  
14:42 - go ahead and download that together. So if you go 
out to Google and you just type in seven zip, the  
14:48 - first thing that comes up is seven dashes zip.org. 
You'll see a download tab here just go ahead and  
14:54 - click on that link and go ahead and download the 
executable for your respective operating system.  
15:04 - So for me, I'm going to be downloading the 64 bit 
Windows version here. And I'm going to hit save,  
15:13 - I'm going to hit Run, say yes, I'm going to go 
ahead and install to the default directory. Okay,  
15:25 - now that's installed, let's go back to our folder. 
And let's select that we open with seven zip here.  
15:37 - Okay, now let's see if we can drag and drop, we 
can, so all I'm doing is dragging and dropping,  
15:44 - I'm putting it in the Downloads folder, you don't 
have to do that you can drag it and put it in a  
15:49 - location that you would prefer, this is going to 
extract I believe at a larger file size than just  
15:56 - the 2.5 gigs that we downloaded the 2.4 gigs. So 
make sure that you have file space where you're  
16:04 - going to put this. So I'm gonna go ahead and let 
this finish and then I will be right back. Okay,  
16:08 - so I've successfully unzip this file. And 
just for the record, if we hover over it,  
16:14 - you can see that it actually extracted to be 
10.4 gigabytes. So let's make sure that wherever  
16:19 - you extract it to you have the 10.4 gigabytes in 
order to successfully complete the extraction. So  
16:27 - from here, let's go ahead and open up our VMware 
Player. And we're going to go to player up in the  
16:34 - left hand corner, we're going to select file, and 
then we're going to select open. And then we're  
16:41 - going to go to downloads. And we're going to go 
into our Kali Linux folder here, and or wherever  
16:48 - you put it, if you didn't put it in the Downloads 
folder, and then just select the one item that  
16:52 - should be here. It's a little four kilobyte file. 
And what this does for us is it automatically has  
16:59 - a build, that's just ready to go. So this is 
really awesome. We don't have to download the  
17:06 - image itself, and then install it and then pick 
all the features. No, this just ready to go for  
17:12 - us. So we can also come down here and select 
Edit virtual machine settings. And there are a  
17:20 - couple features here. So depending on the amount 
of memory that you have on your machine, so right  
17:27 - now this is sitting at two gigs of RAM, that's 
fine. If you want it to run faster, I recommend  
17:34 - going somewhere between four and eight. Obviously, 
the more RAM you give it the the better it's  
17:40 - going to perform. But if you're running on eight 
gigs of RAM for your machine, really not going to  
17:46 - do well for you. My recommendation is no more than 
a fourth. So if you're running on 16, then maybe  
17:53 - give this four, you could really try pushing it 
up to eight. But I am running on 32 right now.  
17:58 - So I could crank this up to eight by my rule here. 
But just for working with you and following along,  
18:06 - I'm going to set this to two and then we're going 
to perform into that way that we are working at  
18:11 - the same speeds across the board. Another thing 
that we need to know is the network adapter, by  
18:16 - default, it's set to net, we're going to go ahead 
and just leave that Nat here, Yours may come set  
18:23 - to bridge if for some reason it's set to bridge, 
you can try that. But my default preference is  
18:28 - Nat. So let's go ahead and just hit OK. Okay, and 
now we're just going to hit play virtual machine.  
18:35 - And a little side note, I am actually now on my 
OS, I'm running on my, my Windows OS as opposed  
18:43 - to just running inside the VM. If I was running 
a VM inside of the VM, I'd have a lot of issues,  
18:48 - segregation, etc. So now I've actually moved 
out of the VM and have this running and player  
18:55 - on my Windows OS. Okay, and then when we get this 
pop up here, go ahead and just say I copied it.  
19:02 - And this will start the machine. And you 
can see the other VMware Player back here,  
19:08 - it's going to go ahead and directly just start 
loading up here and we get to this screen. So  
19:13 - we click in and if we try to just enter in our 
username and password, our username by default  
19:20 - is going to be root. Our password is going to be 
root backwards, so t o r and then hit enter. Now  
19:30 - we can make this full screen over here by clicking 
this button. It will enter into full screen mode.  
19:36 - We are now successfully logged into our Kali Linux 
machine. We've installed this successfully and now  
19:43 - we are ready to start learning. So that's it 
for this video in the next video we're going  
19:48 - to be doing is we're going to cover some of the 
tools and features of Kali Linux. And we'll start  
19:55 - talking about what it's capable of and then we'll 
dive right into the terminal after that and start  
20:02 - learning some. So command line and some useful 
tools with Linux. So I will catch you guys in  
20:08 - the next video. All right, now let's take a look 
around Kali Linux, and just see what it has to  
20:16 - offer us in terms of tools, design, etc. So let's 
dive right in. Okay, so we're at our desktop here  
20:25 - inside of Kali Linux. Now you see the Kali Linux 
logo, you see, there's a couple of things on the  
20:32 - desktop, you don't have to worry about these. 
These are just from VMware themselves put on  
20:36 - your desktop. If you install this as an actual 
OS, this will not be here. So when we talk about  
20:43 - navigating around Kali Linux, there's a couple 
places that we can look, if we look right away,  
20:50 - you can see on the left hand side over here, we've 
got a favorites bar. So we've got our folders.  
20:56 - So if we click on the folders or files, we can 
navigate around this feels like any other machine,  
21:02 - right? We have our documents, downloads, music, 
pictures, if you're a Windows user, or Mac user,  
21:09 - whatever this feels pretty common. So this is a 
GUI or graphical user interface way of interacting  
21:16 - with the folders. As you move on, and we move 
on in this course, we're going to be living  
21:22 - in the terminal. So the terminal is right here. 
If you click on the terminal, this is something  
21:28 - similar to your command line. So from here, we can 
actually navigate to all these folders here. And  
21:34 - we can put files in there take files out anything 
that we can do in a graphic point of view,  
21:41 - we can also do from this command line point of 
view as well. So as we learn, we're going to get  
21:46 - a little less relying on the graphical interface. 
And more on the terminal side of things, however,  
21:54 - do know that there are ways to do a lot of things 
from a graphical side, if you still need that,  
22:00 - that interaction with the machine and you don't 
want to be completely keyboard oriented. There  
22:06 - are also tools on the side over here, if we look, 
we've got a leaf pad. So leaf pad is just like a  
22:14 - notepad, right, or, you know, just your notebook 
here, you can take some quick notes, save it out,  
22:20 - should be pretty familiar for you as well. 
So they've got Firefox, it used to be called  
22:26 - iceweasel. And that's just your web browser. Down 
here are some of the tools that you may use. Now,  
22:33 - burp suite is a very popular tool for web 
application penetration testing, we're not gonna  
22:39 - be getting into any of these tools at the moment. 
But I will cover what a couple of them do. So  
22:45 - again, burp suites, a web application penetration 
testing tool, if you ever get into web app,  
22:50 - or if you even get into some basic pentesting, 
chances are you're going to start using burp  
22:55 - suite on a pretty regular basis. Over here is Zen 
map. Now this is the graphical version of a tool  
23:03 - called n map. And you will be using n map pretty 
religiously when you're doing pentesting. So if  
23:10 - you like a visual view of doing scanning, so n 
map is a network mapper, it allows you to scan  
23:17 - machines for open ports, and for vulnerabilities. 
So if you want that in a more of a visual type of  
23:24 - view, or graphical interface type view, then you 
have Zen map as a feature. This little guy down  
23:31 - here is meta sploit. Now meta sploit is a tool 
that can be taught all these are tools that can  
23:37 - be taught in deep, deep lessons all by themselves, 
not to make that intimidating for you at all. Just  
23:44 - know that that's how robust This is we're looking 
at three tools right here, and they're all very,  
23:49 - very powerful. And this isn't even the half 
of it or the quarter of what Kali Linux has  
23:55 - to offer. So meta splay, you may have heard of 
it. If you've heard of anything in pen testing,  
24:00 - it is a framework that does just a little bit of 
everything. So a lot of pen testers live and die  
24:06 - by this. It's a fantastic tool in my opinion. And 
you're going to get very, very intimate with it  
24:13 - very, very quick if you do move into pentesting. 
Down here is a tool called cherry tree and that's  
24:21 - pretty much where I'm going to stop we've 
got multigo in Kismet, these are just this is  
24:27 - wireless base and this one here is is information 
gathering base, but cherry trees Another useful  
24:33 - one. If we open that up. This is actually another 
note keeping tool like I showed you leaf pad leaf  
24:40 - pads just for quick little one offs. cherry tree 
is more of note keeping as a whole. So you've got  
24:48 - nodes that you can add so you can add a node 
here and just say say you're following along  
24:53 - and you want to add notes. You can say Linux you 
know and then you have a note You can add all of  
25:00 - your notes in here. And then you can actually add 
children nodes as well. So maybe there's a command  
25:06 - that you want to add in. So say, we're covering 
commands and you want to write all the commands  
25:12 - in about Linux down here, you could do that as 
well. And then save this out. Nice thing too,  
25:18 - is that you can take screenshots and put them 
in here. And exports really nice. And this is  
25:24 - going to be very, very useful for anything in 
your career. But when it comes to pen testing,  
25:29 - there are so many tools, so many commands that 
I think it is incredibly important to be able to  
25:36 - take notes and cherry tree is built in already. 
Personally, I use what used to be in Kali Linux,  
25:43 - which is a tool called keep note, but cherry tree 
is a great alternative as well. So either of them  
25:52 - would work in i is highly recommended by me that 
you use some sort of note keeping tool as you  
25:57 - go through your courses and get better as a pen 
tester. So I'm going to close out of this here.  
26:02 - And I want to show you a couple more things, you 
have a feature here where you can show all of your  
26:09 - applications. So if you click on that, it'll bring 
up all the applications, including the ones that  
26:14 - are grouped down here. Another way to do this 
is if we come up into applications at the top,  
26:19 - you can see that everything is grouped really 
nice for you. So it goes through the steps of  
26:26 - penetration testing. And let's say that like, 
a, I'm gathering information on a client, okay,  
26:31 - well, here are some of the built in tools for 
information gathering right here. Say you want  
26:38 - to do a wireless assessment, and you want to 
do that those sorts of attacks, you've got all  
26:43 - these wireless tools built in for you right here. 
Now chances are, you're going to be running these  
26:48 - tools from the command line. So again, you know, 
you don't want to get too hung up on the graphical  
26:55 - side of things, as you may not always have access 
to that either. But it's important to know what  
27:01 - tools that you have in front of you. And there 
are even tools like Wireshark in here. So very,  
27:08 - very useful, pretty much a little bit of 
everything that you can imagine. So just,  
27:15 - you know, take some time and go through the 
tools. And if you're becoming a pen tester,  
27:21 - you're working on it, you know, just just, you 
know, look at a tool and do some research on it.  
27:27 - Say you want to know what this MAC changer is. 
It might be obvious, it might not be obvious,  
27:32 - right? So maybe you go Google, what Mac changer 
does, how to use it, what the syntax is, and then  
27:38 - you play around with that, pick a new tool every 
day, figure out something that you can do with it,  
27:43 - how to use it what it does. But so Kali Linux 
is a distribution full of useful tools. And  
27:51 - it it you know, for a base OS, it's fantastic. 
And this is why so many people in the industry,  
27:59 - just download this, install it and they're 
ready to go. You know, we talked about in a  
28:04 - previous video, how there are other OSS or there 
are people out there that like to just do their,  
28:08 - their base install. And you can see that there's 
bloatware here, if you want to call it that,  
28:13 - right. Like there's forensic tools. And maybe 
you'll never do any forensics in your life.  
28:18 - And you don't need all this installed in your 
system. So if you're a type of person that is,  
28:23 - you know, it doesn't want this extra stuff, 
there's extra software on your system, okay,  
28:30 - then maybe you do start moving towards that custom 
build. Eventually, in your career, you say, hey,  
28:35 - I want I want to learn all these things first. 
And then once I learned what tools I really like,  
28:40 - then maybe you move to your own distribution that 
you create yourself. And you spin that up every  
28:44 - time instead of having all these tools built in. 
But as a basis as something that you can learn  
28:50 - from and start with. This is why I've chosen Cali 
and this is why we're going to learn it today. So  
28:56 - let's go ahead. From here, what we're going to do 
is we're going to dive right into the terminal.  
29:00 - So let's just open this terminal. And then we're 
going to fullscreen it and move on to next video.  
29:06 - So from here on out, what we're going to be doing 
is we're going to be living in this terminal.  
29:11 - I'm going to back away from the graphical side of 
things and really just get your your hands dirty,  
29:21 - in the terminal make you feel comfortable. If 
you've never used Linux before, this is perfect  
29:27 - for you. So I'm going to give you the the pen 
tester perspective on why we're doing a lot of  
29:32 - these things. Some of these commands are going to 
be the same commands, regardless if it's on a Kali  
29:37 - Linux machine or if it's on another distribution 
of Linux. So you'll be able to take a lot of these  
29:43 - commands and just use Linux and another system 
as well. So if you're interested in pentesting,  
29:49 - if you're interested in Linux, this is where we 
really get into the meat of the course and it  
29:53 - should get interesting for you. So I will catch 
you over the next video we're going to start  
29:58 - talking about how to navigate File System and get 
comfortable with that. Alright, on to navigating  
30:04 - the file system. So first let's talk about some 
of the commands we're going to learn today. So  
30:10 - we're going to learn about pwd, which is present 
working directory, we're gonna learn about CD,  
30:16 - which is how we change directories. We're going 
to learn about LS, which is going to be listing  
30:22 - the files in a folder or in a directory. And we're 
also going to talk about how to find some hidden  
30:28 - folders with LS. We'll talk about how to make 
a directory and to remove a directory, we're  
30:35 - going to talk about copying, removing moving and 
locating files. We'll talk about something called  
30:42 - update DB and how that pertains to locating files. 
We'll talk about the password and how to change  
30:50 - our password. And we'll talk about an important 
command called man. So by the end of this first  
30:56 - lesson, you should be pretty comfortable with all 
of these commands and may seem a little daunting,  
31:00 - but they all kind of play in with each other. 
Again, please make sure to take notes you got  
31:06 - cherry tree built in. You can also use keep 
note or even just a notepad in front of you,  
31:11 - that'll help with the experience. And also maybe 
watching the video more than once will help with  
31:16 - the experience as well. So let's go ahead and 
dive right into the command line. So now our  
31:21 - first lesson in Linux terminology is going to 
be navigating the file system. So if you're a  
31:29 - Windows user, you're used to navigating your file 
system probably through folders through a GUI, so  
31:36 - a graphical user interface. Well, in Linux, we can 
do that. But the majority of time we're going to  
31:41 - live in this terminal here. So we really need to 
know how to get around. So the first thing we can  
31:47 - do here is we can say Hey, where are we at? And 
that's a pwd. So that stands for present working  
31:55 - directory. So you type that in, you hit Enter. 
And it says, Okay, we're in the root folder. So we  
32:03 - know that we're in the root folder, but how do we 
get out of the root folder, we can use a command  
32:09 - called CD. And that stands for change directory. 
So if we want to change directory backwards,  
32:16 - we just type in two dots here. And now we can 
say, okay, where are we at? So we're in a slash.  
32:26 - So we're just in a home folder here are just there 
our generic slash folder, right? So what we can do  
32:35 - is, well, how do we know Can we go backwards? from 
here? Let's keep trying. So we do pwd. Again, no,  
32:42 - we can. This is our base folder, right? So you 
have to think of this as the lowest you can go.  
32:49 - So now how do we move around? How do we know how 
to go forwards again? Well, we don't know what's  
32:56 - in our directories, right? So we're sitting 
in this the slash folder, and how do we look  
33:03 - around? So there's a command called ls that lists 
everything that's in the folder. So if we say LS,  
33:12 - we kind of see this color coordinated here. And 
the color coordination just depends on if it's  
33:18 - a folder if the folders read, right, you know, 
there's permission settings, which we're going  
33:22 - to get into later. But the majority of these here 
are folders. Okay, well, we know we just came out  
33:28 - of root so we can go back into root. Now, how do 
we do that? So we can say, change directory root.  
33:36 - And we can actually hit tab to autocomplete. I 
don't know if you caught that. But there's no are  
33:41 - any folder besides root. So at all, I can just 
hit tab. And it should type it out for me. Oh,  
33:47 - I lied. There's a run in here somewhere, but it's 
hidden. We're gonna cover that soon as well. So  
33:53 - our Oh, hit tab, autocomplete can change directory 
into root. So let's LS and root and see what's in  
34:00 - here. Okay, this is more like our home folder, 
right? So we've got desktop documents downloads,  
34:06 - this is kind of what applies to the root user. So 
what if we're sitting in this root folder here and  
34:15 - we wanted to access instead this Etsy folder? 
Well, could we do the same Etsy command here?  
34:21 - Well, I'm hitting tab, and nothing's happening. 
Well, because Etsy doesn't belong in this area,  
34:28 - right. But if we put a forward slash in 
front of it, because this is the base,  
34:33 - and then we hit et CIE, there, now we can navigate 
to the Etsy folder, and we can actually double tab  
34:40 - and see what's all in the Etsy folder like an LS, 
se no. Another way to do that is if we wanted to  
34:47 - LS what's in the Etsy folder without navigating 
to it, we can just type ls Etsy, and you can  
34:53 - see everything that's in here. So there's some 
some tricks that we can do right? So we don't  
35:00 - have to actually navigate to the folder to know 
what's in there. Again, if we LS. And we want to  
35:07 - know what's sitting in videos, or even, let's 
say what's sitting in desktop for our folder,  
35:13 - well, if we start typing desktop and hit tab, we 
can't do that either. Because everything in Linux  
35:19 - is case sensitive. So if we start typing desktop, 
and then hit tab, now, we can LS and see what's in  
35:26 - there. So our VM ware came with a couple of shell 
scripts here that are automatically placed on our  
35:31 - desktop, we wanted to confirm that you could see 
that they're both right here. So as of right now,  
35:39 - we are just sitting in our route home folder. And 
we know how to navigate around. So if we wanted to  
35:45 - go to desktop, we could, we could hit LS now and 
see what's in there. If we wanted to go backwards,  
35:52 - we could. Okay, now we're back in our, our root 
folder. And you can also tell where you're at your  
35:59 - present working directory sits right here, right. 
So this little a Tilda is actually your home  
36:04 - folder. And you can see that we're in desktop. 
So if we wanted to go back into our desktop,  
36:10 - instead of typing, so you want it to go to music 
from your desktop, instead of going route music,  
36:17 - which will work, you could also just say I 
want to go music. And that'll put you there  
36:26 - as well. And notice you don't need the leading 
forward slash when you use the automata. So  
36:31 - just some couple interesting tricks that 
you will kind of pick up along the way,  
36:36 - tab is definitely going to be your best friend. 
If you run into something with multiple options,  
36:41 - say you're trying to CD and you say I want to go 
on my desktop and you're tabbing it's not working,  
36:46 - you can hit double tab, and then it'll show you 
Okay, well, there's desktop documents, downloads,  
36:51 - those are your three options, start with a D. So 
now you kind of have an idea as to how to kind  
36:58 - of move around. But let's do a little bit more. 
So what if we want to make our own folder? Well,  
37:05 - there's something called make directory, MK 
Dir. So if we say make directory, and we'll  
37:13 - say I'm just gonna use my name here. So now if we 
LS, we can see that this he folder is now here,  
37:21 - we can go into the heat folder. And there should 
be nothing in it right? So we can go back. And  
37:28 - we can also get rid of the heat folder, remove 
directory heat, the LS again, it's gone. So now,  
37:38 - what else can we do? Well, we can also look 
for hidden folders. So we can say LS dash LA.  
37:45 - And we can look for hidden files and folders here. 
Remember the color coordination. So this dot cash,  
37:54 - right that in theory is a hidden folder. So if we 
say CD dot cash, we can go into there we LS and  
38:01 - there's actually some some information in there. 
But when you saw it originally, you didn't see  
38:06 - that, we're going to cover more on this, I just 
kind of want to show you that trick. As you see  
38:10 - over on the left side, there's file permissions 
and properties. So be aware that just because  
38:16 - it looks like something's not there, doesn't mean 
it's not there, it might just actually be hidden  
38:21 - similar to Windows where you have hidden files and 
folders. So just a quick trick to show you that.  
38:26 - So another thing we can do. So let's go back. 
And don't worry about what I'm doing here, you're  
38:36 - going to cover these commands in a little bit. I'm 
just going to echo Hi, and we're going to put that  
38:43 - in a test dot txt folder. So now if we LS, you 
can see that test dot txt is here. So if we want  
38:53 - to actually copy this file, we can copy this file 
to another location. So we can say, hey, I've got  
39:00 - this test dot txt, but I actually want to move 
it to downloads. And if we go LS to downloads,  
39:10 - you can see that test dot txt is actually sitting 
in there. And if we wanted to remove it, we can  
39:18 - just say remove from downloads, or test dot txt. 
Actually, sorry, remove downloads test dot txt,  
39:27 - we don't have to transition into that directory 
if we don't want to. So another trick, say we want  
39:33 - to see now that it's gone. We want to LS but we 
don't want to keep typing this out. If you hit the  
39:37 - up arrow. Now you can just see your old commands. 
So if you keep typing your command over and over,  
39:44 - you can see what's going on. So LS shows that 
there's nothing in downloads now we were able  
39:49 - to successfully remove that file. So another 
thing that we can do is we can actually move  
39:55 - so say we wanted to move test dot txt and we 
wanted to put that In the downloads, okay,  
40:02 - now if we LS test dot txt is now gone from this 
folder. Because we've moved it, we haven't made a  
40:09 - copy, we've actually physically moved it away. 
So now if we LS Actually, let's just tab up,  
40:15 - you can see that test dot txt is now in 
there. I'm going to remove that here. Okay,  
40:21 - and now the last thing I want to show you, is the 
locate feature. So if we wanted to locate a file,  
40:30 - say I wanted to locate bash, let's see. So we're 
looking for a file, and we're going to get more  
40:38 - specific along the way. But if you type 
in locate, you can kind of look through a  
40:43 - system to see if you can find it. Now I'm looking 
for, say, any type of bin bash or bin or bash,  
40:51 - that's fine. That's really what I wanted. But 
it shows you everything with bash in it. Now,  
40:57 - this might not work right away, what you might 
need to do is update the database. So you type  
41:02 - in update dB, it updates everything for you. 
And then you can use locate again. So it has to  
41:08 - build that database of the information that it's 
finding in order to locate what you're searching  
41:13 - for. So make sure that you use update DB sort of 
frequently. Okay, so two more things I want to  
41:19 - show you. And then we'll close out this video and 
move on to the next one. So an important thing you  
41:25 - want to do with your new account is we're using 
a default password, and that's not very secure.  
41:29 - So to change a password for our user, we can just 
type in pa SS WD. And now it's going to ask us for  
41:40 - a new password. So instead of using tour, we can 
use something else. I'm going to type in the very  
41:46 - secure password as my password for an example 
here. But if you plan on using this machine,  
41:52 - for future reference, you can type in a secure 
password and kind of keep it. So lastly, I want  
42:00 - to show you is something called man. So man pages, 
man pages are your instructions for any command  
42:07 - that you're running. Most commands come with a 
man page. So let's say we want to look at LS, we  
42:13 - can say man LS. And then it's going to give us all 
this information here about LS. So if you see it  
42:21 - says LS is list directory contents. Awesome. And 
then it gives you what options we can do. Well,  
42:27 - we can do a dash a for all what you saw earlier. 
And you can kind of scroll through here and just  
42:33 - see exactly what it has to offer. And that's 
kind of it. So when you go through here, you  
42:42 - can kinda you know, if you're struggling to like, 
you know, there's a command in there, but you're  
42:46 - not sure exactly what the command is, you can type 
in man and search it. And sometimes you can do LS,  
42:52 - I don't know if this is going to work, but dash 
dash help. And you get some information as well.  
42:56 - It doesn't provide you the full man pages, but 
it provides you something pretty close. So that's  
43:03 - kind of just your way around if you ever get 
stuck, something to look for. Okay, so that's it  
43:08 - for this lesson. Next, we're going to move on to 
users and privileges, how to add users and how to  
43:13 - how to change some pseudos and some modifications 
to our file permissions. So until next time,  
43:21 - my name is Heath Adams, and thank you for joining 
me. Alright, now let's talk about users and their  
43:28 - privileges. So what are we going to learn in this 
lesson, we'll do a quick user privilege overview.  
43:35 - From there, we're going to talk about the CH 
mod command, which is the change mode command,  
43:40 - that's going to let us change the permissions on a 
file or directory. We're also going to talk about  
43:48 - how we're going to add a user with the Add User 
command. From there, we're going to take a look  
43:53 - at a couple of important files. One is the Etsy 
password file. And the other is the Etsy shadow  
44:00 - file. So the Etsy password file is not actually 
where the passwords are stored on a machine. That  
44:07 - is the Etsy shadow file which stores the hashes. 
But the Etsy password file does store it where the  
44:13 - users what users are on the machine. And you can 
correlate that to the shadow file. So we'll talk  
44:18 - about those in more detail and their importance 
to pentesting. Very, very important. And then  
44:25 - we're going to talk about su which is the switch 
user command. And finally, we'll talk about sudo,  
44:31 - which is a command that allows you to elevate your 
privileges on a Linux machine. So let's go ahead  
44:38 - and dive right into our lesson. Okay, so now we're 
going to cover users and privileges. So in the  
44:45 - last video, we touched a little bit on privileges 
with our LS dash l A. And we touched a little bit  
44:51 - on users by changing the password of our root 
account. So now we'll cover a few more commands  
44:57 - regarding those. So if we look at ls dash l A. 
You could see all this crazy, jumbled wordage over  
45:09 - here, right? So it actually means something. So 
we look at the first line here, if we see a dash,  
45:17 - like this a hyphen, that means it's a file. If we 
see a D, that means it's actually a directory. And  
45:24 - then you see our W and x. So rW x actually means 
read, write, execute. It's the permission settings  
45:32 - that this particular group has. Now there are 
three groups here, there's the first, second,  
45:40 - and then your third right here, right? So your 
first group, right here is the owner of the file.  
45:49 - So it looks like the owner of the file has full 
READ WRITE execution, right. And then the next set  
45:56 - of three here is actually the permissions for 
the members of the group that owned the file.  
46:01 - So this is a group ownership as opposed to actual 
ownership here. So for the people that are in the  
46:08 - group that has access to this file, they can only 
read and execute, they can't write to it. Now,  
46:14 - for the last one, this is just all their users. 
So any common user here can actually just read  
46:21 - and execute, they can't write the document. So 
that comes into play, especially when we get  
46:27 - into penetration testing, because with penetration 
testing, we're looking to have full access, right,  
46:32 - so we're always gonna be looking for that folder 
that has full READ WRITE. Typically, if we look at  
46:39 - temp, that's our temp folder. A lot of times, you 
see the temp folder has full read, write, execute.  
46:44 - So when we're doing penetration testing, we're 
trying to upload some sort of exploit, we might  
46:50 - actually upload it into the temp folder, because 
that's where we can execute those, those files.  
46:55 - However, we could also be looking for other full 
READ WRITE execute files, where we need to modify  
47:02 - them and give us root access to a system. So it's 
all about insecure configurations. And we're going  
47:10 - to cover that more once we get into the actual 
penetration testing part of the course. So for  
47:15 - the Linux essentials part of the course, all we 
need to worry about is these file permissions.  
47:20 - Another important feature of that is if we were to 
create a script, or scripts not gonna be able to  
47:25 - run until it has full access. So how do we change 
access here. So let's make a file. I'm just going  
47:33 - to make all this echo another text document, 
right, so we'll just say hello. And actually, I  
47:41 - typed that in backwards. So hello, and we'll call 
it Hello dot txt. So if we LS here, by default,  
47:54 - we only have read write and then read access for 
everybody else. Meaning if we wanted to read it,  
48:00 - we could say cat, which we're going to get into 
later. Cat Hello, dot Tex, and it just says hello.  
48:06 - So what can we do here? Well, we can use something 
called change mode, in changing mode is CH, Mo D.  
48:14 - And we have a couple options here. So we can do 
a plus, right, and we could say, well, we want  
48:22 - READ WRITE, execute, or we just want execute. But 
another way I like doing it is you have a number  
48:32 - feature. So the one you really need to know is 
all sevens. sevens gives you full read write  
48:40 - access across the board. So if we say ch mod 
777 Hello dot txt. Now we LS LA. And you notice  
48:51 - that Hello dot txt turns green, that means it 
is full rewrite. And here you go. We've got  
48:57 - the dash here saying it's a file, and we've got 
READ WRITE execute across the board. So this is  
49:03 - how we change file permissions. You don't need to 
necessarily know about the other numbers in terms  
49:07 - of penetration testing, it becomes more in terms 
of configuration and security management of files  
49:13 - if you were to get down that path. So just stay on 
the easiest path. Just remember 777 or plus x will  
49:20 - work as well. So changing the mode is is critical. 
And we're going to cover it time and time again  
49:26 - throughout the course, once we get a little bit 
deeper. So a couple more things we need to talk  
49:32 - about. say we wanted to add a new user. Well, 
there's a feature called Add User. So we say Add  
49:39 - User, and one or two names is allowed. So we need 
to add user to john. Okay, so it made something  
49:48 - for john. Let's give him a password. Give them a 
password again. And we'll just hit enter for the  
49:57 - default. It's all correct. Okay, so We now have 
a user named john. And we can confirm that we can  
50:05 - actually cat The Etsy password file here. And you 
see down at the very bottom, we have this user,  
50:13 - john. So this Etsy password file you're going 
to become very familiar with, because it shows  
50:20 - you all the users now this will, there's a lot 
of times when you're doing penetration testing,  
50:24 - you're gonna have access to this Etsy password 
file, because it doesn't provide the password  
50:28 - anymore, it used to a long time ago, passwords 
are now in the shadow file. So you actually have  
50:35 - a little bit of access and information disclosure 
here at the hands of poor configuration. So you  
50:42 - see that I've created a user john, well, that 
gives us a little bit of information, say there's  
50:46 - SSH on a machine or something else, we can use 
that username for john to try to break into the  
50:51 - machine. So we'll cover that again later. But if 
we wanted to see what the Etsy shadow file looks  
50:58 - like, now we come in here, and you've got these, 
these jumbled stuff here, right? So it's just a  
51:07 - hashing format. So what we're doing is we can 
actually use a tool like hash cat to break this  
51:14 - down and crack these passwords. Now, a password of 
password will be very easy. But just know that if  
51:22 - you have access to the Etsy shadow file, you have 
a good chance of cracking a password, depending on  
51:28 - your capabilities, and depending on the strength 
of the password, that allow you access to a  
51:32 - machine. So something to think about there. Okay, 
so now we have our user john, let's go ahead and  
51:39 - switch to him. So we can use something called Su, 
which stands for switch user. And we'll say switch  
51:45 - user, john. Okay, so automatically gave us john 
here, let's see if we could switch back to root.  
51:51 - Okay, we can't just switch back to root, because 
we need roots password, right? So we can type  
51:58 - in password, and that works. But if we didn't 
know the password, then we'd be stuck on john,  
52:03 - we are able to access john because we were already 
root. So this comes into play in terms of users.  
52:10 - Let's go back to john here. Now, if your user 
you have to be able to do certain things,  
52:18 - you need permission to do certain things I should 
say, right, so root has full access and permission  
52:24 - to do everything. But john, we just created john 
john doesn't have any sort of access. So if we  
52:29 - wanted to, if we wanted to change the password, 
say we want to change the password for for root.  
52:35 - I can't modify the password information because 
I don't have that kind of access. Now there is  
52:43 - something called a pseudo which would provide 
john the access if we gave it to him. So it's  
52:48 - called a sudoers file. And basically, anybody in 
that sudoers file can change permissions given  
52:56 - if they are a pseudo user, right? So we would 
type in sudo, password root. And it's going to  
53:05 - ask for the password for john. But you're going 
to notice, hey, John's not in the sudoers file,  
53:10 - john can't do this. So john has base permissions, 
right. And we're going to counter that a lot of  
53:16 - times in penetration testing, where if we get in, 
we'll get something called lower privilege. And  
53:20 - we'll get an account like john, and we're going to 
try to escalate into root but we just can't do it,  
53:26 - you know, the chances of doing a doing that and 
having a john in a sudoers file is just not high.  
53:33 - It's possible, but it's not likely. So for now, 
just know that if you want a user other than root,  
53:40 - to have access to file permissions, you need 
to have them in the sudoers file, that becomes  
53:44 - useful to in penetration testing, because you 
can look at the sudoers file if you have access  
53:49 - to see what users have sudo privileges. Okay, so 
that is it for this lesson. In the next lesson,  
53:56 - we're going to be covering network commands, and 
moving on gradually towards scripting. So let's  
54:02 - go ahead and get there. And I will see when we 
get over there. Alright, so now we're going to  
54:06 - be covering common network commands. So before 
we dive into the commands we're going to learn,  
54:12 - I'm going to go on a tiny bit of a rant here. 
So if you are not familiar with networking,  
54:18 - now's the time to become familiar with networking. 
There are two things I think that a person needs  
54:25 - before they really can dive into pentesting. And 
that is Linux experience, which you are gaining  
54:31 - some Linux experience now because most pen testing 
is done in Linux. And the other thing is to have a  
54:38 - good network foundation. So if you're looking 
at these commands here, and I say if config,  
54:44 - which if you're a Windows user, and you hear 
IP config, do you know what that is? Okay,  
54:49 - that's basically the same thing. If you know what 
ping is, if you know what ARP is netstat route,  
54:55 - those should all be pretty familiar where 
you can guess what those are. If you do not  
55:01 - know what these commands are, you might want to 
brush up on your networking as well. Because the  
55:07 - better you are at networking, the better you're 
going to be when it comes to pentesting, because  
55:12 - you're going to have to navigate around networks, 
you're gonna have to understand where you are at  
55:16 - in a network, you're going to need it for basic 
troubleshooting as well. So just to understand  
55:22 - these commands are gonna be very important. But 
what we're going to be doing here is we're going  
55:27 - to be taking common network commands that we're 
going to be running as a pen tester. And we're  
55:32 - just going to apply those to their version in 
Linux. Some of these may be familiar to you,  
55:37 - some may be new to you. But we're talking here if 
config which is going to show us some information  
55:43 - very similar to IP config in Windows, where we'll 
see our ipv4, ipv6 if we have it information,  
55:50 - our MAC address, things along those lines, our 
subnet mask, etc. The IWC config is the wireless  
55:58 - adapter version of that. Ping is a ping command, 
where we talk over ICMP, and we try to communicate  
56:06 - to another machine to see if it's alive and 
responding back to us. We've got the ARP command,  
56:12 - which just maps IP addresses to MAC addresses. 
And we've got netstat, which is just a command  
56:21 - line tool that's going to allow us to display all 
connections and listening ports. And then finally,  
56:27 - we've got route which displays our routing 
table. So we'll go ahead and take a little bit  
56:33 - of a deep dive into those in this next lesson. And 
hopefully, this is a refresher for you. So again,  
56:38 - if not, then you should be looking into 
some networking studies as well. Okay,  
56:45 - so let's go ahead and dive right in. Okay, so 
now let's cover network commands. So the first  
56:52 - command I want to cover is if config. So you may 
be familiar with the Windows version of this,  
56:58 - which is IP config. And they pretty much do the 
same thing. So it shows you here, your different  
57:05 - interface types and the IP address associated 
with them. So it's zero here, Ethernet zero,  
57:12 - has an IP address of 190 2.1 68.13 2.164, you can 
see the netmask, the broadcast address, and you  
57:23 - can see the MAC address as well. And we also have 
a loopback address here. Now, if your machine has  
57:31 - a wireless adapter, or at some point, you want 
to do wireless penetration testing, you're going  
57:36 - to need a W config. And you should not expect 
to see anything on this at the moment, unless  
57:43 - you're using a laptop, then you actually might see 
configuration down here for it. If you would see  
57:49 - something under IWA config, you would see like a W 
LAN one w land zero, something along those lines,  
57:55 - okay, and another common command that we're 
going to see is going to be the ping command.  
58:00 - So we can just type in ping, and the address 
that we're trying to talk to. So for example,  
58:08 - I'm going to try to ping my home router. And I get 
talking back. So if I tried to ping something that  
58:18 - wasn't in my network, like a 16.1, you're gonna 
see the results change. So with ping here, ping  
58:26 - is going to be endless, until we hit something 
like Ctrl C to stop it, it'll ping forever. So  
58:33 - I'm gonna hit Ctrl C again, and kind of show you 
the difference. So you see that we attempted to  
58:39 - ping here. And we got replies, we got information 
back. Well, that's good. That means we're talking  
58:47 - to the other machine, it says, Hey, are you there? 
It says, Yeah, I'm there. And we try to ping this  
58:51 - machine here. But this machine's not talking back, 
it could mean that the machine is on the network,  
58:57 - or that the machine is just blocking ICMP traffic. 
ICMP is a another word for Ping. So moving on to  
59:04 - the next command, I want to show you ARP. So the 
best way I like to type in is ARP with a switch of  
59:12 - a and ARP is just going to show you MAC addresses 
that it talks to and the IP address. Actually,  
59:24 - I said that backwards, it's going to show you 
the IP address it talks to and the MAC address  
59:27 - associated with it. So if an IP address reaches 
out, say 192168 15.1 talked out to this machine,  
59:38 - it's gonna say okay, Hey, who are you? It's gonna 
send a broadcast message out to say who has this  
59:44 - IP address? And then the IP address will respond 
and says, Hey, I do and this is my MAC address. So  
59:50 - ARP is just a way of associating IP addresses 
with MAC addresses. And once you know that,  
59:57 - you can also look at netstat So netstat dash a and 
O is another one of my favorite commands. And this  
60:06 - shows you just the active connections that are 
running on your machine. So if we scroll way up,  
60:11 - and you can just kind of see what's open and 
what's talking here, where this really comes in  
60:22 - handy on a penetration test is to see if a machine 
is talking to somebody else. Same thing with ARP,  
60:30 - you want to know what that machine is associated 
with? And is it talking to something on a port. So  
60:38 - this is more just internal right now, but it's 
still good to know. So for example, if I were  
60:42 - to open up a Firefox page and connect out to the 
internet, then I went and I did a netstat. Again,  
60:48 - I would see information about that port being 
open and, and that I am going out with it. So  
60:56 - just kind of keep that in mind. These are not 
commands that you really need to know in depth  
61:03 - right now. Networking does come into play when 
you are doing penetration testing. But what we're  
61:09 - going to cover these commands time and time. 
And again, I just wanted to give you a very  
61:14 - brief introduction to them. Okay, in the last 
command that I have for you today is route C,  
61:22 - if you type in a route that's going to print 
your routing table in the routing table is  
61:27 - important because it tells you where your traffic 
exits essentially. So for this VM, my traffic is  
61:36 - exiting on 19216813 4.0. So any traffic goes out 
of this 0.0 dot 0.0 gateway, in this range, right.  
61:47 - So when it goes out this gateway, it's doing Nat 
so network address translation, and it's running  
61:55 - off my computer. So the best examples aren't here. 
But it's important to know route as well, because  
62:01 - there could be a machine that you're attacking 
that has multiple routes. So you might see a 134  
62:07 - and a 135. Because it has a dual home Nic meaning 
it has two NICs inside of it. So it's actually  
62:14 - talking to a completely different network that 
you didn't know existed. So you might have been  
62:18 - attacking one network on the 134 range, and then 
135, just out there, and this computer can talk  
62:24 - to both and until that point, you had no idea. And 
that's the idea of called pivoting when you switch  
62:30 - a network from one to the other, but you're using 
a machine. So that's it for this lesson. In the  
62:36 - next lesson, we're going to talk about viewing, 
creating and editing files. Okay, so viewing,  
62:42 - creating and editing files. This section sounds 
exactly like what it is. We're going to talk about  
62:49 - how to view create and edit files. Mainly, we're 
just going to be showing how to create quick text  
62:55 - documents. But we'll teach you commands that 
will allow you to do further in the future,  
63:00 - as you will see as we get further in the course 
and get into scripting. So let's go ahead and take  
63:05 - a look at some of the commands that we're going 
to be learning. So some of the commands that we're  
63:10 - going to learn, we're going to learn the echo 
command, which echoes what we write right back out  
63:15 - to the terminal, we're going to look at the cat 
command, which is going to print out a document  
63:22 - for us it's similar to type in Windows, we'll 
talk about replacing versus appending. And which,  
63:29 - which function does which and how to do it. 
We're going to talk about the touch command,  
63:36 - which can be used to create a file on the fly. 
We'll talk about nano, which is a text editor  
63:44 - that's built into the terminal. And then we're 
going to talk about g edit, which is also a text  
63:49 - editor. But it is a GUI text editor. So we do get 
a little bit of gooey in this lesson. So let's  
63:56 - go ahead and dive right in. Okay, so this is my 
second time recording this video. The first time  
64:03 - I forgot to turn my microphone on and performed 
for my cat. So she approved of it. Let's see if  
64:09 - you approve of it the second time around now that 
I have a little bit of practice. So we're gonna be  
64:13 - talking today is really talking about viewing, 
creating and editing files. So I've already  
64:19 - showed you the echo command. If you recall, we 
used echo to create a file, right? We created  
64:26 - a Hello dot Tex. And we can just echo Hello 
out to the terminal. We could say echo Hello,  
64:31 - and I'll say hello back. So what we can do with 
echo is we can use it to write to a file. So if  
64:41 - we were to say echo, hey, and then we write it to 
Hey dot txt. Well, we can look and see that hey,  
64:54 - dot txt is here. And you can see my files from the 
previous one. So I'm trying to Come with more ways  
65:00 - of saying hello. But we're going to use hate text 
here. So if we cat hate at tax, a all cat does is  
65:11 - print out to the screen what is in a file? It 
says, Hey, okay, so let's say we want to append  
65:18 - cat are we want to append hate. txt? Well, we 
can tab up here. What if we just say, hey, again,  
65:26 - we've got this greater than symbol here. And we're 
just putting it into the hate. txt file. Well,  
65:35 - that didn't work. We didn't append it, we actually 
overrode it. So what if what what can we use to  
65:42 - actually over append this, here's what we can do 
is we could say, hey, again, again, right? Just  
65:50 - to give us something different. And we can add a 
second greater than symbol here. So now if we cat  
65:57 - the file, you can see that we actually appended to 
the end of it. So this becomes incredibly useful  
66:03 - when we are either adding stuff to a list say 
we're gathering IP addresses, and we just want to  
66:10 - combine our lists, or when we're creating a series 
of commands, and we're going to use those commands  
66:17 - to send all at once. We're going to cover that 
later, when we're talking about file transfers  
66:21 - in the penetration testing section, where we use 
a set of commands like this on a Windows machine.  
66:27 - To actually transfer files via FTP is just so 
much easier than typing them all in one by one,  
66:34 - we can create a little document and run the 
document. So this becomes useful when we have  
66:39 - a series of commands and for other reasons, as 
well as you'll learn as you go on in your Linux  
66:45 - career. So we've talked about Echo, and we've 
talked about cat. So let's talk about some other  
66:51 - ways to create a file, we can use something called 
touch, and to say New File dot txt. And if we LS,  
66:59 - you can see that new file dot txt is here. But if 
we cat new file, there's nothing in there because  
67:07 - they haven't put anything in there yet. So there's 
a few things that we can do, we could use echo  
67:11 - and append the file, right? We can also use a tool 
called nano. nano is a terminal text editor. There  
67:19 - are other terminal text editors like VI and vim. I 
don't prefer those Personally, I like now the most  
67:25 - some people have their preferences. So I encourage 
you to play around with any of them as you wish VI  
67:30 - and vim are the other two. But for this course, 
we're going to be using nano. So if I say nano,  
67:37 - new file dot txt, I could type whatever I want in 
here. We're going to be using nano a lot to create  
67:47 - scripts to create Python scripts. And to edit 
shellcode as we get into a little bit exploit  
67:56 - development. So I'm going to hit Ctrl x, I'm going 
to hit y for saving, and then we'll save it to new  
68:04 - file dot txt. If we cat this, now it says hey, I 
could type whatever I want in here. So that's one  
68:10 - way of editing it. Another way of editing it is 
using a graphical interface. So we can use g edit,  
68:17 - and say new file. And if you don't like using a 
terminal, you're more than welcome to use g edit  
68:25 - here. Just type in new line here and save it. And 
I like using g edit, it's a lot cleaner, because I  
68:32 - can you know, highlight and delete, I don't have 
to use my keyboard to navigate around like I do  
68:38 - in the terminal. So if you have the option to use 
g edit for sure, but sometimes you're going to be  
68:42 - on another machine that's not your own or is 
headless and doesn't have a GUI that you're  
68:47 - going to have to use now. So get comfortable using 
both. So we save this, let's go ahead and cat it  
68:54 - out and see what happens. Okay, you can see that 
the new line is in there. So really, that's the  
68:59 - overview that I wanted to cover. So just know that 
you can create files pretty much using echo touch.  
69:07 - And actually, you can create files using nano 
as well. If you say nano, this is new text. I'll  
69:15 - just say hello, control x, save it, you LS you 
can see this is new text is right here. So you  
69:26 - can use all of these tools in different ways to 
create files, it's completely up to you how you  
69:31 - want to do it. Personally, when I'm creating a 
file, I use nano and I just create a new shell  
69:38 - script Python script. txt document that way, you 
could also do it using g edit as well. So just  
69:45 - know that we're going to be using these a lot and 
try to get comfortable with these. And from here,  
69:50 - we're going to be moving into controlling callee 
services. So we're just going to briefly talk  
69:55 - about what services you need running on boot and 
how to do that. All right, In this video, we're  
70:01 - going to be talking about starting and stopping 
Cali services. Let's go ahead and just take a  
70:06 - quick look at the commands we're going to learn. 
So not a lot of commands in this video only two,  
70:11 - we're going to talk about the service command, 
and the system CTL command. So the service command  
70:17 - deals with services, it's going to allow us to 
start and stop services on the fly. And the system  
70:23 - CTL command is going to allow us to enable or 
disable services so that they load up on boot, or  
70:30 - do not load up on boot. So let's talk a little bit 
more about services and look at how these commands  
70:36 - can be useful for pentesting. Alright, so let's 
talk about starting and stopping services. So  
70:44 - when we're in Cali, there are a couple different 
ways that we can start and stop services. And  
70:49 - when I talk about a service, I'm talking about 
something like a web server, or SSH, or maybe a  
70:56 - sequel database. So we cover this video today, 
I'm going to show you a few different services  
71:02 - and how to start them and stop them. I'll show you 
how to start them permanently on boot. And we'll  
71:08 - talk about which services are important to keep 
on boot, which services are important to start  
71:15 - when you feel like that just starting them or when 
you need them, etc. So let's start with our first  
71:20 - service, which is going to be Apache two. Now 
Apache two is a web server. So let's go ahead and  
71:27 - do a proof of concept. First, let's start with 
a command that we learned in an earlier video,  
71:31 - which is if config. I'm going to grab our ipv4 
address right here. And I just want to copy this,  
71:39 - I want to go out to a web browser over here. And 
we're just going to paste this address. Now you'll  
71:50 - notice that it says it's unable to connect, this 
is expected here we're not running a web server.  
71:56 - Now let's go back in here. And let's just say 
service, Apache to start. Okay, looks like it went  
72:10 - through, let's go ahead and hit Enter again. And 
now you can see that Apache to Debbie and default  
72:14 - page has been loaded. So what has changed? Well, 
when we boot our machine, this Apache two service  
72:22 - is not running by default. So if we want to run 
a web page, then we actually have to start up  
72:28 - the service for to work as you just saw here. Now 
you can see that if we want to add files or place  
72:35 - files here, well, we're going to have to edit 
the var www HTML folder. So if we come out here,  
72:42 - and we go into other locations computer, and then 
we go into our bar, www, HTML, you'll see that the  
72:55 - index, that HTML page is here. So if we actually 
wanted to maybe host a malicious web page and have  
73:00 - it pointed back to us, this is one way we might do 
it right here. If we want to serve up some files,  
73:05 - say we have something that we want to upload to 
a machine that might be malicious, or, you know,  
73:11 - a file that we want to transfer to somebody else 
or download on another computer doesn't have to be  
73:16 - malicious, we could host that file in this folder 
here. Now that is fine. This is one way to do it,  
73:22 - right, you can put your files all in one location. 
But you know, it's not my favorite way, it was my  
73:29 - favorite way when I first got started. There is a 
much easier way now and I will show you how to do  
73:35 - that. So let's go ahead and type ls, you'll see 
we have no documents here. So I'm just going to  
73:42 - echo Hello into Hello dot txt, and then have that 
Hello dot txt here. Now what we can actually do  
73:52 - is we can spin up a web server. So we can just 
say Python dash M for module and say simple HTTP  
74:02 - server, you can auto tab it, and then say 80 for 
the Port 80 is already in use. So let's just give  
74:10 - it 80 8080 is in use from the Apache server at the 
moment. So instead, let's look at what happens.  
74:16 - So let's just call it out at 8080. And you can 
see here that I can go to this Hello dot txt  
74:23 - and actually get the file, I have information in 
real time whether or not that file was captured.  
74:28 - And overall, this is just a web server that's so 
easy to spin up, I can put it in the directory  
74:33 - that I want it to. So if I wanted to serve my 
desktop folder, I would navigate to desktop and  
74:38 - then spin this, this Python module up. I don't 
have to put everything into a VAR www folder.  
74:45 - And it just makes life really, really simple. 
So just proof of concept. We can do a service,  
74:51 - Apache to stop and we can come back and make sure 
that that web server has been stopped by going  
74:59 - here. and refreshing. Now you can see that it's 
gone, we can CD into something like downloads,  
75:07 - we say LS, there's nothing in here. So we can tab 
up a couple times, and just serve up Port 80. Now,  
75:17 - because you can see it's not in use anymore. 
And come back here, refresh, you can see there's  
75:23 - nothing in the directory listing, because there's 
nothing in the folder. So this is just an easy way  
75:29 - to spin up a web server, I think it's much easier 
than Apache two, I'm showing you both because they  
75:35 - like to give alternatives. But using Python moving 
forward is a great, great feature. My challenge to  
75:42 - you is to look up how to spin up a FTP server 
with Python. So I won't get redundant here. I  
75:50 - do have future lessons and other courses that 
talk about this. But if you want to challenge  
75:55 - yourself to figure out how to spin up an FTP 
server, that's my challenge to you, there's  
75:59 - a module out there that you can download quite 
easily and spin up your own FTP server. So let's  
76:05 - go ahead and Ctrl C, and we're going to close out 
of this. And now let's talk about spinning up a  
76:11 - service permanently. So let's say that we just had 
the Apache two running and then we rebooted the  
76:16 - machine. When we reboot our machine. Apache two is 
not going to be online. Because we're only doing a  
76:22 - service start, it only holds during this session. 
Once we reboot that it session is gone, that  
76:28 - service is gone. So if we want to keep something 
online the entire time, what we can do is use  
76:33 - system CTL. So we can say system CTL. Enable or 
Disable if you want to disable something. And  
76:44 - for example, we can say SSH now I'm not going to 
hit enter here. This is just as an example. Let's  
76:49 - say that we wanted to have an SSH available on our 
machine so we can SSH into it. We are opening up  
76:56 - SSH for this feature here. Okay, let's say that 
we want to have a server and this is one I do  
77:04 - want you to hit enter in. This is going to be a 
database, right? This is a PostgreSQL. So we're  
77:10 - going to say systemctl enable PostgreSQL. And 
we have enabled that so now when we reboot this  
77:18 - PostgreSQL will load every single time. Now, why 
is this important? Well, this is important because  
77:23 - it's going to allow us to run meta sploit and have 
the PostgreSQL database running when we boot so it  
77:32 - doesn't have to take the extra time to load it. If 
we come over here, and we just click on the meta  
77:36 - sploit framework. Now PostgreSQL is working, and 
it says database already started. So it's already  
77:43 - configured, it's going to skip initialization. And 
it's going to go ahead and get right into it. So  
77:46 - it just says a little bit of time that display can 
take some time to to run. And I think that if you  
77:53 - continue on, I know if you continue on with being 
a pen tester, you're definitely going to be using  
77:58 - medispa quite a bit. So this is just one feature 
that if you're going to be using it, it doesn't  
78:02 - hurt to have it enabled on your system boot. 
Now if you feel that you want to have a patchy  
78:08 - two on boot, you can go ahead and do the same 
thing with the system enable systemctl enable,  
78:14 - but the only one that I recommend putting on is 
this system CTL PostgreSQL. Okay, so that is it  
78:22 - for this video. In the next video, we're going 
to be talking about installing how to install  
78:28 - things from GitHub and how to install using apt 
get. So let's go ahead and move right into that  
78:34 - video. All right, welcome to the Penn ultimate 
video, we are going to be focusing on installing  
78:43 - and updating tools. So let's look at our agenda. 
So what are we going to learn we're going to learn  
78:48 - how to install updates for Kali. So we're going to 
learn how to install updates using a tool called  
78:54 - apt get. And we're also going to learn how to 
install tools using apt get specifically we're  
79:01 - going to be installing a tool today called get 
we're going to be using Git then to clone from a  
79:08 - website. So sometimes when we have a tool that we 
want, it's not always in apt get, it's not in the  
79:14 - repository. So we're going to actually have to use 
GitHub and maybe use a tool called Git to download  
79:20 - tools or other items from GitHub. But this is 
just going to be one example. But it's a very,  
79:26 - very common example that you may have to do as a 
pen tester. So let's dive in and take a look at  
79:32 - how we can use these commands to install tools and 
update tools. Okay, so one of the important things  
79:40 - you need to know is how to not only install files 
on your computer, but also how to install updates  
79:49 - on your computer. So for Cali, since it's a Debian 
base, we're going to use something called apt get  
79:54 - and the first thing I'm going to show you is how 
to install updates. So the common way to Do this,  
80:00 - if you don't use the GUI and you want to use the 
terminal is apt get update. And then we'll do  
80:07 - and apt get, upgrade. Let's go ahead and just hit 
enter on this. Let's explain what it's doing. So  
80:18 - the first command here is saying apt get update. 
So what we're doing is we're looking through  
80:23 - packages. Now these packages are predefined the 
repositories. And what it does is it says, Okay,  
80:29 - I'm going to check packages here for updates. And 
it went through looks like they use archive Linux,  
80:35 - dude, it you, they check these packages here. 
And they update the packages. And then once they  
80:42 - update the packages, they run this command. So 
basically, the Add command is you're going to do  
80:47 - something as well, right? So first, we're going 
to update and then we're going to upgrade. So  
80:55 - based on what's in these packages, it's gonna say, 
Okay, well, we know the following packages were  
81:01 - automatically installed and no longer required. 
So all these things right here, they're gonna be  
81:06 - removed. And then the following packages have been 
kept back, okay, they're fine. They're not going  
81:13 - to uninstall those. And then we have the fine 
packages that are going to be upgraded. Okay,  
81:19 - so it's a long list that needs updating. And 
then you come in here, and you say, Okay, well,  
81:25 - it needs 252 megabytes of additional disk space 
to continue, you can hit enter for Yes. And it'll  
81:32 - automatically start upgrading. So if you want to 
update your machine to its newest and best form,  
81:39 - you can go ahead and do that, I'm going to go 
ahead and just hit no on this guy. Okay, and now,  
81:46 - it's also important to know how to install files. 
So I'm going to show you two different ways. One  
81:52 - way is through apt get similar to what we just 
did. And the other way is going to be through  
81:56 - Git itself. So let's go ahead and install git, 
we're going to use apt get to install Git. So it  
82:04 - will look something like this, we'll just say apt 
get install, get. And we'll hit yes on this. And  
82:13 - another way to do this is to add a dash y at the 
end of this. So you'd say apt dash get install,  
82:20 - get dash y. And that'll automatically say yes, 
if you just want to accept whatever's coming out  
82:25 - for you, you go ahead and just hit yes on that. 
And it may take a minute for these to install.  
82:31 - While this is installing, let's go ahead and talk 
about what Git does. So Git works with GitHub. So  
82:40 - when we talk about GitHub, we're talking about a 
lot of people update their projects, their code,  
82:47 - their frameworks onto GitHub, especially in the 
penetration testing slash hacking community,  
82:54 - it's often that you're gonna find some cool 
tools that are out there that are installed  
82:59 - on Kali Linux can't be found through apt get, and 
you have to actually download them from GitHub.  
83:05 - So it's very important to know how to use Git. 
And it's very, very simple. So we're on a page  
83:12 - like this. This is Vail framework. It's a very 
popular tool in penetration testing and malware  
83:18 - analysis as well. So say we wanted to install 
this, well, there's a couple things we could  
83:24 - do. The first thing we could do is always read the 
directions and see what they recommend. There is  
83:31 - a quick install here. And if you look, they have 
a apt install Vale here with the dash y. So that  
83:39 - will work. Or you can use gets install, where you 
have to install Git first. Okay, and then we do a  
83:46 - git clone. And we run the configuration setup. So 
that's what we're going to do here, we're going  
83:52 - to install Vail just for the fun of it, just so 
you can kind of get used to how to use GitHub how  
83:57 - to use Git, and go from there. So let's go ahead 
and just Alt Tab back over looks like we have it,  
84:04 - we can check it by typing Git and hitting tab. 
Okay, so Git is here. And we're just going to hit  
84:12 - space, we know the command is clone. And while 
it provides it for us down here, it says, Hey,  
84:19 - get clone, copy this. The other place you can do 
is right here where it says clone or download,  
84:25 - you just copy this bad boy right here. We'll 
all tab back over to our terminal and just hit  
84:32 - paste. Okay, and this is going to install in 
the directory that you choose. So I just put  
84:39 - it in this root folder here. And actually our home 
folder I should say, and it's installed right here  
84:47 - the folder is they all right here. Typically 
when I install things, I like to put them in  
84:52 - the OPT folder. So here CD OPT, but since I went 
ahead and downloaded here, let's just go ahead for  
84:58 - an example purpose. If you Do you want to install 
to object, you're more than welcome, you can move  
85:02 - the folder there as well. So what we're gonna do 
is we're going to CD into Vail. And then we'll  
85:09 - hit LS. Now remember, there were instructions. So 
let's go ahead and look at what those instructions  
85:15 - were. These instructions said, you're going to 
run dot forward slash config. setup that sh,  
85:23 - forced silence, let's go ahead and just copy this 
guy. We'll come back in here. And we'll hit paste.  
85:30 - And it's just going to run out of this config 
folder, setup that sh. And now it's installing. So  
85:39 - we could have easily installed this with apt dash 
kit, which, if you look, look what it's doing,  
85:45 - it's actually rolling through the packages 
here. And it's updating the repositories,  
85:50 - right these packages, and then it's going to go 
ahead and download what it needs. So it's running  
85:57 - apt get anyway, if you see updating apt, it's 
installing the dependencies. So the easier way,  
86:03 - the quick way, which he suggested was to do it 
through there, and it's right, they don't always  
86:08 - have the installed packages in apt get. So that's 
why I wanted to show you the GitHub version of it.  
86:16 - So you can go ahead and let this install. Let's 
just go ahead and recap quickly what we just did.  
86:21 - So we used, we used apt get update, and upgrade to 
install updates in our system. We used git clone,  
86:31 - to be able to download packages and clone packages 
off of GitHub. And we used apt get to be able to  
86:41 - download Git itself. So that's really it for 
this lesson, what I do encourage you to do is go  
86:47 - through the man pages of get and go through the 
man pages of apt get, because you're also able  
86:54 - to remove programs, update specific programs, etc. 
So this lesson really just wanted to introduce you  
87:01 - to the basics of downloading updating for your 
system. I encourage you to learn how to remove  
87:08 - files, as well as a little bit of homework for 
yourself. So thank you for joining me, and I'll  
87:13 - catch you over in the next lesson. All right, 
welcome to the last lesson video. So in this  
87:21 - video, we are going to be scripting with bash. Now 
this may seem a little overwhelming at first, what  
87:27 - we're going to be doing is building out a ping 
sweeper script, it's going to be pretty basic.  
87:33 - And what I want you to do is maybe just watch 
this video once, and then the second time through,  
87:40 - really try to follow along with it, take notes, 
etc, I think of first time watch through you know,  
87:48 - just to get the concepts, understand what 
I'm doing. And then the second time really,  
87:52 - really get hands on with it. And I think that will 
be probably the best way to learn. But if you have  
87:57 - a different learning style, please do go ahead 
and try that as well. The only thing I could say  
88:01 - is don't let this intimidate you. Hopefully by the 
time the video is over with you will have a pretty  
88:07 - good understanding on basic scripting and how 
scripting can really be beneficial and improve our  
88:13 - timing, improve automation, etc. So let's go ahead 
and quickly talk about some of the things we're  
88:18 - gonna be learning in this video. Okay, so some 
of the commands and items we're going to learn,  
88:24 - we're going to talk about grep, which is going 
to allow us to narrow down some results. We're  
88:30 - also going to talk about cut and T are both of 
those are also going to help us narrow down some  
88:37 - results. So basically, we're going to start with a 
ping, that we're going to send out and we're going  
88:42 - to want to gather information back that says that 
ping was valid. So we want to know any computer  
88:48 - that responded to us. Well, how are we going to do 
that? Well, we need to identify what a valid ping  
88:55 - looks like, we're going to use grep to to kind of 
narrow down a string or a sentence or something  
89:00 - that identifies with a positive Ping. And then 
we're going to cut out everything we don't want  
89:05 - and use tr as well to cut some things out that 
we don't want. So we're going to put this into  
89:12 - a script when it's all said and done. And we're 
also going to be talking about the usage of for  
89:17 - loops and their importance, not only with using 
them in this script, but how we can use simple  
89:23 - one liners to do everyday things for us. So I'll 
show you at the end of the video how we're going  
89:30 - to use like n map and use a for loop with n map to 
run through and map scripts. So stay tuned through  
89:38 - the video. Again, if you are a hands on learner, 
maybe first time through you you try hands on but  
89:46 - my recommendation here is to just sit back, watch 
the video understand what's going on. Second time  
89:52 - really follow along with it, take notes and get 
the most that you can know this lesson. So let's  
89:57 - go ahead and get started. Alright, so now we're 
going to be covering bash scripting. So the first  
90:04 - thing we're gonna need to cover before we get 
into writing our scripts is how to narrow down  
90:08 - results. And we say narrowing down results. What 
we're saying is for given a block of text, and we  
90:15 - want to extract some information from that block 
of text, how are we going to do that? So that's  
90:20 - what we're going to cover in this lesson. Okay, so 
let's go ahead and get started. What we're going  
90:26 - to be doing today is narrowing down a ping result. 
So if we come into here, and we need to ping an IP  
90:33 - address within our system, so I'm going to be 
pinging 192 dot 168, dot one dot 90. And you're  
90:42 - going to see that it returns a 64 bytes from 
that address. So it looks like we're getting  
90:49 - a response. I'm going to hit Ctrl C here. So 
if you remember from the networking section,  
90:54 - we actually get a response unlimited until we 
cancel it, right, like we just Ctrl C here from  
91:01 - Ping. So there's another thing that we can do, if 
we only want to send one packet and see if it's  
91:06 - alive or not, we can do a dash c of one. So we're 
just going to do that. So that's a count of one,  
91:13 - we're sending one packet over, if we set 10, it 
would send 10 packets over if that makes sense.  
91:17 - So now what we're going to do is we're going to 
put this into a txt file. So if you remember from  
91:23 - previous video, we just use this little carrot 
here. And I'm going to call this IP dot txt. Okay,  
91:31 - and if we cat IP dot txt, you'll see the same 
results there. So now what we're going to  
91:37 - want to do is we're going to want to narrow this 
down. What do I want to extract from here? Well,  
91:42 - I want to extract this IP address. And it'll 
make more sense when we get into the scripting  
91:47 - part. But what we're going to do is we're 
going to get out, specifically of this,  
91:51 - this IP address from this line. Now, all we're 
interested in actually is a returned IP address  
91:59 - that has a valid response, right? So if I were 
to tack, or if I were to enter in here, save 15  
92:08 - dot 90. Okay, there's no response there. So this 
is kind of what it looks like. When it doesn't get  
92:15 - a response back, it just kind of lingers. And then 
we hit Ctrl C, and it says, zero ping statistics,  
92:22 - right, nothing was was received back. So what 
we see when we get a response back, as we see  
92:28 - 64 bytes, when there's no response back, we don't 
have any bytes. So if we're doing a sweep through  
92:35 - a network, which we're going to be doing later, 
we need to be able to narrow down these results.  
92:39 - So if we're sending say 190 2.168 dot 1.1, all the 
way through to 55. And we want to see who responds  
92:49 - back and then take that list and narrow it down 
to the IP addresses, which exactly what we're  
92:54 - going to be doing, we need to know how to narrow 
that down. So we're going to be narrowing down on  
93:01 - specifically is 64 bytes. So let's tab up a couple 
times to this cat IP address. And we're going to  
93:08 - do a pipe and the pipe just means we're going to 
add an additional command here. So the additional  
93:13 - command we're going to do is called grep. grep 
is going to grab any line with what you specify.  
93:18 - So let's specify 64 bytes and see what happens. 
See, now if you notice, we had all of these lines  
93:26 - before. And now a grep is doing is grep is taking 
only the lines that contain 64 bytes. So again,  
93:34 - a valid response. So we have 64 bytes here. And 
we have achieved a response. So what we're going  
93:43 - to do now is we're going to narrow this down some 
more. Okay, we've got this line here. But again,  
93:49 - we're still trying to extract this IP address. 
So how can we do that? Well, there is a tool  
93:55 - called cut. So if we tap up again, we do another 
pipe because they're sending a new command. We're  
94:02 - gonna say cut and cut syntax looks like this. And 
I'll explain it once I type it out here. Okay,  
94:09 - so we have cut, and then this hyphen D, that's a 
delimiter. So the delimiter is what we're going  
94:17 - to be cutting on. So we're giving a delimiter of 
a space, meaning here's a space, here's a space,  
94:24 - here's a space, so we're going to be cutting 
on these spaces. And then we give a field,  
94:30 - we say okay, what field we want to retrieve 
back from this cut. Okay, we want field four,  
94:35 - if you look 1234 and the fourth field is 
our IP address. So it's going to say okay,  
94:44 - I'm going to cut on this space, I'm going to cut 
on this space, I'm going to cut on this space,  
94:48 - and then I'm gonna take it right here. Now if we 
identified field five, we will be taking this if  
94:54 - we identified field three we'd be taking from so 
let's go ahead and just hit enter and see what  
94:59 - that looks like. Okay, so now we are narrowed down 
even more. But there's an issue here, if we were  
95:07 - to try to send this IP address, we would have this 
little colon here attached on to it, and you can't  
95:14 - ping with that IP address. So we're going to be 
doing a sweep or narrowing down this list, then  
95:18 - we're going to actually need to remove this guy 
here. So let's take a look at how we do that. So  
95:24 - if we tab up again, and again, we're going to add 
a pipe. Now we're going to use a command called  
95:29 - tr. And tr just means translate, what we're going 
to be doing is another delimiter. So dash D there,  
95:36 - and we're going to be taking out that colon. So it 
should look something like this. If we hit enter,  
95:41 - now you can see that that colon has been removed. 
Okay, now let's talk about how we can use this  
95:47 - information to write out a script, we're going to 
start with a basic script, and we can add upon it  
95:52 - as we go. So I've gone ahead and written out a 
script, but we're going to talk about it very  
95:58 - slowly, so you can actually look at it and copy 
it down. So what we're going to do is go ahead  
96:03 - and say g edit, and I call this IP sweep.sh. So 
go ahead and do the same or something similar,  
96:10 - and hit enter. So let's take a look at this 
script. So at the very top here, we have to  
96:18 - declare what we're doing. So we're going to give 
a hash bang. And we do this with any scripting  
96:22 - language. So if was a Python, we'd be entering 
Python here, but this is bash. So we're going to  
96:27 - be doing a forward slash bin forward slash bash 
that declares that we're running a bash script.  
96:32 - And the.sh also indicates that we're running a 
bash script. So I want you to ignore this line  
96:39 - here in this line here. For now, let's talk about 
this line. This should look very, very familiar.  
96:43 - So we're doing in this line, we're saying we're 
going to ping with a count of one, which we talked  
96:50 - about. And then we're going to do something here, 
we've got $1, sign one and $1 sign IP, let's just  
96:56 - ignore that for now. Okay, so we're going to go 
ahead and do the rest that should look familiar,  
97:02 - we're going to say we're going to grab 64 bytes, 
we're going to cut the delimiter of a space field  
97:07 - before, and then we're going to do a translate, 
right and take off that little bit at the end.  
97:12 - Okay, I added an ampersand here at the end. So 
an ampersand allows us to do threading. So that's  
97:19 - exactly why it's in there. If we didn't, we'd have 
to let the process go one IP at a time. And we'll  
97:25 - talk about that in a second as well. So let's talk 
about this four line. So a for loop is what we're  
97:32 - actually running here. And the loop is saying, I 
want to do an IP address, we're just declaring a  
97:38 - variable here, you can call it whatever you want. 
Or we're saying, hey, for this IP in a sequence of  
97:43 - one through 254, we're going to do something and 
that do is a pain. So what this means is for IP,  
97:50 - and if we think about it in sequence one through 
254, what it's saying is 1234, all the way up to  
97:57 - 254. Okay, so think about it this way, if we say 
for one, in this ping sweep, we're gonna do that,  
98:06 - right, so we're gonna say 414243, all the way 
through to 34. That's what this loop is doing. So  
98:14 - it's a very, very simple loop. Now, IP is replaced 
down here, at the very end. Now, we're also  
98:22 - calling out this dollar sign one. Now this dollar 
sign one is user input. So we're going to actually  
98:29 - do something this is called IP sweep, right. 
So we're gonna have to call out this IP sweep  
98:35 - something like this.sh. And then we're going to 
have to give out some information, it's going  
98:41 - to request information, if we don't provide it, 
it won't know how to ping. So we're going to do  
98:46 - is we're going to say the first three octets of 
our home network. So if yours is 190 2.16 8.1,  
98:54 - like mine is, then you just enter 192 dot 168 
dot one. Now, we could also for simplicity,  
99:02 - just hard code this. So we can say 192 dot 168 
dot one.ip address, and it will be fine. We don't  
99:12 - have to build this in the only reason we're not 
hard coding it is because you can do multiple pin  
99:18 - sleeves. This can be a ping sweep script for you 
in the future if you're on a different network, or  
99:23 - you just want to write something out really quick. 
dollar sign one works perfect. But if you want to  
99:28 - leave it hard coded like this, it'll also work. So 
let's go ahead and just delete this out. I'm going  
99:34 - to put this into dollar sign one again to have 
a proof of concept. And then we are going to run  
99:42 - this. So all we do here at the end is declared 
done. If we didn't run this with an ampersand  
99:49 - here, we would have to add a semi colon similar 
to this. But because we are having an ampersand  
99:55 - we can actually get rid of that and just put that 
back just for some syntax. Clarity here. Okay,  
100:02 - so let's go ahead and save this. And remember from 
our lesson, we're going to have to change the mode  
100:09 - of our script because it's not executable by 
default. So we're going to do a plus x here.  
100:14 - And then we're going to call our IP sweep that 
sh, we can LS and make sure it's green. Here's  
100:20 - ip c.sh. And then we'll do a dot forward slash ip 
sweeped a sh, and I'm not going to enter anything  
100:26 - in as want to show proof of concept. So see a ran 
through every single number here and threading,  
100:31 - and nameless service not known because we 
didn't provide an IP address. So what we can  
100:37 - do here is we need to provide that IP address 
168 dot one, hit enter. Okay, and it pulls back  
100:45 - some information. So what we can do with this 
information, let's write this out to a file. So  
100:51 - let's just call this IP list dot txt, something 
like this. Okay, it's done. Now, let's just cat  
101:00 - out the IP list dot txt. Okay, now we have an IP 
list of the IPS in our network that we just swept,  
101:07 - right. And we can use this information later on. 
But before we go into that, I do want to go back  
101:13 - and just improve our script a very, very tiny bit. 
So let's go ahead and just tab up a couple times.  
101:19 - So we get to our G edit. And let me show you how 
we can improve this script, it doesn't have to be  
101:25 - overly complicated, what we can do is, we can say 
something like this, we can come in here and give  
101:34 - an if statement. So an IF is conditional, 
right? We're gonna say, if this exists,  
101:38 - then do something. And if it doesn't exist, do 
something else. So we're gonna say if dollar sign  
101:45 - one is equal to nothing, is going to give blank 
space here. And then we're going to say, then we  
101:56 - want to do something. So what are we going to do, 
we can echo out something similar to you forgot an  
102:04 - IP address. And then echo out what you need to do. 
Like syntax. dot slash ping sweep, or IP sweep is  
102:19 - what we call this IP sweep that sh, and then IP. 
Or we can even write it out an example, right?  
102:29 - Like something like that. So that way, our user, 
if they're using it, we wrote this for somebody  
102:35 - else, they know what we're talking about. And at 
the very end, we just need to write if backwards,  
102:39 - we'll put it ephi. So what this is saying is, 
if this is not then echo here, right, we're  
102:46 - going to echo these, and then we need to add one 
other thing here, which is an else, let's go ahead  
102:52 - and hit enter, just to space this out a little 
bit. So if we have no dollar sign one declared,  
102:59 - right, if we have nothing entered in, we're gonna 
say echo, you forgot an IP address and syntax  
103:04 - here. If we do have something in dollar sign one, 
okay, we're going to do something else, we're  
103:09 - going to do our ping sweep. And that's it. So this 
is very similar and modified from Georgia Weidman  
103:17 - that I've got a long time ago. So full credit goes 
to her for this little script, it was very, very  
103:23 - easy to learn. And it's also very easy to teach. 
So let's go ahead and just run this one more time,  
103:29 - we're going to say IP sweep the SH. And look what 
happens now it says you forgot an IP address. Now  
103:37 - we can declare a number in there anything in the 
scripts not perfect, right, we were expecting  
103:41 - three octets. And we could give it a one. And 
it's still going to do something like that,  
103:47 - which is incorrect, right? So we need to be able 
to, to modify this down more, but that gets really  
103:54 - advanced scripting into declaring that needs to 
be three octets. And if you don't provide those,  
103:58 - then what, and that just gets more advanced. 
So we really just need to know, hey, what we're  
104:04 - doing here, very basic script for ourselves, and 
something to remember. Okay, so let's clear our  
104:10 - screen. Last thing I want to show you. So we've 
been able to write a script out. But we can also  
104:16 - do looping in one line. And this is where it 
becomes kind of fun. So we have this IP list,  
104:23 - right? We did cat IP list dot Tex. Now let's say 
we've got this IP list together, and we want to  
104:31 - do an N map scan on all of these IPS. Now we could 
just say and map and type in the syntax you want  
104:39 - and the IP address of it. For every single one of 
these start a new tab and let that happen. Or you  
104:45 - could do something in a for loop. So we can write 
the same for loop that we did before. We're going  
104:52 - to say for IP, and then we're going to do is we're 
going to write $1 sign and we're going to cat the  
104:59 - IP List dot txt. So all it does is is bringing out 
this list that we have here and it's saying, okay,  
105:05 - for this IP, this IP, this IP, etc we're gonna run 
through all of these. That's what the loop does,  
105:09 - right? Okay, we're gonna do our semi colon, and 
then we're going to tell it to do something,  
105:14 - right. So what do we want to do? Okay, let's run 
a mF script. So we're going to say do and map.  
105:21 - And we'll ping, or we'll do a port, Port 80 on all 
these, and we'll say, still scan that on port 80.  
105:30 - And we'll do t four for a speed. And that should 
be yet. So then we can do done like this and let  
105:41 - it run through one at a time. We can also do the 
ampersand and let it run multiples like this,  
105:47 - we can hit enter and see what that does. But I 
also forgot one thing here, forgot to declare the  
105:53 - IP address. So let's talk about it real quick. 
So we've got a very, very simple one liner, and  
105:59 - you're gonna see one liners a lot if you get into 
ethical hacking, and just allows us to do things  
106:04 - quickly and scripted. So we got four IP address in 
this list. So every IP in this list, we're going  
106:10 - to loop through, when we do that loop, we're going 
to do an map, we're gonna do a quick stealth scan  
106:16 - of Port 80 t four, and we're gonna say declare the 
IP address. If you're not comfortable with M map,  
106:22 - that's okay, this is purely an example. And 
something you will see in your career. I will  
106:27 - make a scripting video at some point for n map. 
And we'll cover mF more in detail. So let's go  
106:32 - ahead and just hit enter. Okay, I messed up my 
syntax. So what's going on? Okay, so for IP in,  
106:41 - this got deleted for IP and cat IP list. Let's try 
this one more time. Okay, so we just did all these  
106:51 - scans seven scans at once. And what we did is, you 
see, these are the processes that are starting. So  
106:57 - it started up eight processes, actually not seven. 
And it's just running through this list doing the  
107:02 - scans. And we're going to go ahead and just kind 
of look at it. So it says, okay, on one dot 74  
107:09 - is at open, it's open, okay. And then on 254 
is at open, it's open. And then you see filter  
107:16 - down here, or it's not running, filtered, 
filtered, same thing. So we can hit Ctrl C,  
107:22 - or hit enter for done. And that's pretty much it. 
So what we just did is we ran a map scans at one  
107:29 - time instead of having to copy and paste these. So 
that's just a little bit of what scripting can do.  
107:34 - It does get more advanced. But to be able to know 
a one line for loop is a really, really important  
107:41 - if you go into penetration testing. And it's 
just important in basic bash scripting as well.  
107:47 - So that's really it for this lesson. And that's 
really it for this course. So I hope you really  
107:52 - learned something from this course, if you did 
find it valuable. Please do share it with others.  
107:57 - Please subscribe. If you haven't, please do like 
the video, word of mouth is the best thing for me,  
108:03 - it helps me grow my channel and helps me give 
content back to you as I get more feedback. And  
108:08 - I grow as a channel. So I'm looking to do more 
courses in the future. And appreciate you taking  
108:15 - time with me. If you like this course and you want 
to chat with me check the descriptions down below,  
108:20 - I've got a discord channel, we've got quite a few 
people in there. And I've also got a Twitter if  
108:26 - you want to hit me up there. Lastly, I do have a 
Patreon. If you felt like this course is valuable,  
108:32 - and you'd like to support me, any dollar amount 
goes a long way for me recording equipment,  
108:37 - recording software, all that's very expensive. 
And the time spent on this is also very detailed  
108:45 - long hours. So if you want to support me 
or, or anything a like, subscribe, etc,  
108:51 - it goes a long way. I appreciate you taking the 
time to watch this course. And until the next one,  
108:56 - thank you so much for joining me. All right, and 
now some bonus material. So I'm adding in some  
109:03 - additional resources. These are for those of you 
that want to continue on, you've learned Linux now  
109:10 - and you're like, Hey, I really want to be a pen 
tester. I think this is for me, I'm gonna provide  
109:15 - you a whole lot of different resources here. So 
take notes, these are some of the best resources  
109:21 - I could think of for those wanting to get into 
the field. I'll briefly cover each of them and  
109:26 - then leave you added to do your own research 
and hopefully, see you in the field someday as a  
109:31 - pen tester. So let's take a look at some of these 
resources. Okay, so first resource is a shameless  
109:38 - self promotion. And I only do this because I do 
think that I'm a valuable resource. I'm trying  
109:43 - not to be biased here but I've got some good, good 
stuff that's completely free if you're interested  
109:48 - in it. So if you come to youtube.com slash c slash 
the cyber mentor, you can come to my page here and  
109:55 - you can check out all the videos I have. One video 
is a day in the life Have an ethical hacker. So if  
110:02 - you want to know what it's like to be an ethical 
hacker, if you're still not sure if this is the  
110:05 - field for you, this might be a video for you to 
view talks about the day in and day out stuff that  
110:11 - you might do, what kind of assessment work you 
might be asked to do and what it's really like  
110:16 - to be a, an ethical hacker. On top of that, 
I've got another video on cyber career paths  
110:22 - about penetration testing and ethical hacking. 
So if you're looking to get into the field,  
110:27 - and you want to become a pen tester, or ethical 
hacker, and you're not quite sure where to go,  
110:33 - this is probably the better video for you, it kind 
of talks about all the knowledge that you'll need  
110:38 - for a junior perspective, and really the knowledge 
that you'll need to be successful in the field,  
110:43 - including certifications, etc. So if you're 
watching this video as an additional resource,  
110:48 - this will probably be additional resource. 
Part two is a good way to call it this is  
110:55 - the one like really detailed on penetration 
testing and ethical hacking. On top of that,  
111:00 - over here, I've got playlists. So if you come 
into the playlist, I've got a few courses,  
111:05 - most importantly, is our zero to hero course. 
So if we come to the cyber mentor.com, and you  
111:13 - go to courses over here, and you go to zero to 
hero pentesting You can find more information  
111:18 - on the syllabus. So I put it into lesson plan as 
well here, but there are let's see 11 episodes,  
111:26 - we start with Linux kind of like you've already 
learned, no keeping some introduction, we do  
111:32 - Python for two weeks, we do information gathering 
Oh send recon scanning, enumeration exploitation,  
111:41 - we do internal attacks as well. So we'll build 
out an Active Directory lab. And we'll learn  
111:47 - how to do these internal attacks aren't really 
taught in a lot of courses. And then we'll end  
111:53 - it with some file transfers, maintaining access, 
etc report writing as well and career advice. So  
111:59 - this is like my complete course, it's called zero 
to hero to take somebody from from a complete zero  
112:05 - and bring them into hero where they can start 
doing some pentesting on their own. So again,  
112:10 - if you're interested in that course, you can come 
to my website and check it out with lessons plan,  
112:14 - you can just click in the tab and play the video 
or on my YouTube channel, you can click right  
112:18 - on the playlist and play it from there as well. 
So leaving the shameless self promotion, let me  
112:24 - talk about some more cheap alternatives. hack the 
box is a great, great alternative if you're just  
112:30 - getting started. So for hack the box, what it is, 
is it's a series of vulnerable machines. So you  
112:38 - could think of it almost like a game. So if you 
want to do some hacking, this is a great place to  
112:42 - just start practicing and learning the ropes. What 
we can do is like say we could pick something on  
112:49 - the easy side, you want to look for something 
like that's more green right on the left,  
112:53 - because that shows easy, you would pick a box like 
this, you would scan against it. And you know,  
112:58 - if you don't know what I'm talking about, that's 
fine, but you would scan against it and try to  
113:00 - find vulnerabilities and hack it. So really, 
really great website, if you have the VIP,  
113:05 - they're starting to move it, it's in beta right 
now. But they have 20 boxes that you can attack  
113:10 - on active side and 20 in the VIP. But the nice 
thing about the VIP is they're about to open up  
113:16 - all 97 that had been retired. So they retire one 
every week and they bring a new one in. So you  
113:22 - gain access. It's like $13 a month, this is free, 
completely free platform if you don't want it but  
113:27 - this is 13 bucks a month for the VIP access. And 
you can come in here and do some of these machines  
113:32 - that are super duper easy. And if you click into 
them, they'll have write ups for them. And they'll  
113:38 - also have video walkthroughs for a lot of these 
machines. So that's a really, really great stuff,  
113:43 - right? If you have no idea what you're doing, 
this is a great place to start. Because these  
113:47 - retired boxes are boxes that have already been 
done, you can watch how somebody else did them,  
113:52 - you can learn their methodology. And this is 
really good for just getting the basics down  
113:57 - and understanding you know, some basic hacking. 
Same thing here with the virtual hacking labs,  
114:02 - it's very similar. They've got a labs, they've got 
a course and they got different pricing. So you  
114:07 - can try these out if you're interested in them. 
So they are, you know, just alternatives to just  
114:15 - practice online. Then you've got bowling hub as 
well, you'll have to search through this and try  
114:19 - to find something that's like beginner level or 
Google online, which which are realistic boxes,  
114:24 - or what are good boxes on volm. hub of Ohio, 
basically you just download the VMware file, and  
114:29 - you play it on VMware and you try to attack the 
the machine so you download a machine, you try to  
114:36 - attack it. And these are intentionally vulnerable 
machines, all these right here on these top three.  
114:41 - So let's say that that's not really where you want 
to start, you think maybe you could use a little  
114:47 - bit more hand holding and you like a certification 
to come behind it. I'm going to show you the top  
114:53 - three in my order that I think for pentesting 
at least at a beginner to mid tier level,  
114:57 - what the top three are. So either insecurity gets 
number one slot in my mind, if you come into here  
115:04 - and you go on to certifications. So they've got 
a couple different ones, the ECP PT, or actually,  
115:10 - let's go to courses. So the penetration testing 
student and the penetration testing professional,  
115:15 - the student is for the beginner, the professionals 
a little bit more advanced leaves off for the  
115:20 - beginner ends. So if we come in the student, 
you can see some of the things that you'll  
115:25 - learn. So they've got, you know, it talks about 
the preliminary skills that you might need and  
115:30 - teaches you those, it's got some programming, 
and then just the basics of penetration testing,  
115:35 - but it gives you an idea what it's like. On top 
of that the ISP PTP course they have is like  
115:42 - more in depth more advanced, you start getting 
into assembly language and buffer overflows,  
115:48 - you get into network pentesting, some PowerShell, 
Linux web app, Wi Fi, some Ruby for medispa light.  
115:57 - So I think this is a really well rounded really up 
to date. The downside of this course is that it's  
116:02 - not, it's not really well known on the HR side of 
things so and then the pricing can get a little  
116:09 - expensive. On the elite side, right now it's 16 
$100. The cheapest is the 1200, I would at least  
116:15 - get the middle tier. But as of right now they're 
offering that PTs and the PTP, if you buy the PTP,  
116:22 - they give you the PTS for free, but that won't 
be going on much longer. But you can always  
116:27 - hold out for deals like this as well. Another 
resource and a very, very well known resource,  
116:33 - probably the best certification in terms of being 
known is the O SCP. So it starts out at 800 bucks,  
116:41 - as you can see here, you're probably going to 
spend more money than that, because that's just  
116:44 - 30 days. So the nice thing about this is it comes 
with labs, there's a certain amount of machines in  
116:50 - there that you can try to hack against, sort of 
like a hack the box, but it's an environment. So  
116:55 - you can you notice, attack whatever you feel like 
and try to navigate your way through the network.  
117:00 - And then when you are done, and you want to test 
for the certification, you have to actually hack  
117:07 - in an environment of the set number of machines 
you have to hack against. And you have to be  
117:14 - successful in hacking those machines to get your 
certification. So it's considered one of the more  
117:17 - difficult certifications out there to achieve. 
And you'll see it come up a lot of times in HR  
117:24 - or job applications that they want this oscp. So 
this is something to look into and consider as  
117:30 - well. The cost isn't as bad as the elearn. But 
the con here is that office of security courses  
117:36 - haven't been updated in five or so years. So you 
really need to, you know, it's kind of the best  
117:43 - of both worlds if you were able to do both. 
But this one will get you into more doors,  
117:47 - this one will get you a little bit more current. 
But there are plenty of resources out there,  
117:51 - all these tabs are showing you that you don't 
have to spend a ton of money to get this stuff.  
117:56 - These are more things that if you want that 
certification, you want that that coursework,  
118:00 - that knowledge, these are great resources, all 
three of these. So last is the G Pen. Now the G  
118:06 - Pen is just an exam. By itself, it's 17 $100. It 
is by sans right. So this is showing g i see you  
118:16 - actually have to take the corresponding sans 
course that goes with it. And that course is  
118:22 - upwards of $6,000. So unless you can get a 
employer to pay for this sans certification,  
118:28 - probably not the best. But the thing that I 
like about sans is that it stays up to date,  
118:34 - they are constantly updating their courses, and 
that they look good on a resume. It's one of those  
118:41 - really high tier high level certifications. And 
the exam from what I hear is actually pretty good.  
118:47 - It's not a practical exam, but it's a fairly 
good exam. And the nice thing I didn't mention  
118:52 - elearn security is also a practical so this oscp 
is practical, the elearn security exams practical,  
118:58 - you have to hack your way through to to pass and 
write a report as well. This one is a multiple  
119:04 - choice exam, I do believe. So these are three 
certifications that you can look into if you  
119:10 - wanting to go down that route. I would start with 
the PTS if you can, it's dirt cheap. You know,  
119:16 - if I have to make a recommendation just to make 
sure that you're you're really interested in this,  
119:20 - if you know for sure. And you want to do that 
pts PTP combo, this might be a good choice here.  
119:26 - But other than that, I mean, the free resources 
like I've got my channel, there's ton of videos,  
119:33 - the zero to hero course is like at least 20 to 30 
hours of material. hack the box you'll spend a lot  
119:39 - of time on there's plenty of write ups if you just 
Google like, honestly, if we go into here and we  
119:44 - say like apocalypse here. If you say that and you 
Google that with right up, you're going to find  
119:50 - the right up for this or you'll find a video for 
this or some kind of walkthrough, right. So you  
119:56 - just want to look through these and try to try it 
on your own and then go back And then watch the  
120:00 - write up and see how you could have improved if 
you'd got through it. Or where you can improve an  
120:06 - enumeration or whatever it is you need to, to get 
better to actually succeed the next time you try  
120:11 - attacking these machines. So that is it. You have 
reached the end of this course and the end of the  
120:17 - bonus material. If you need anything, I provided 
my contact info again in the beginning. You know,  
120:24 - I'm at the cyber mentor on Twitter, you can reach

Cleaned transcript:

What is up everybody, my name is Heath Adams and I welcome you to this course called Linux for ethical hackers. So in this course, we're going to be covering a lot of things, we're really going to be going in hammering down on the terminal and the command line. And if you've never learned Linux before, this is a really great start for you, especially if you're interested in becoming Ethical Hacker or a penetration tester. So enough of my face. Let's go ahead and just dive right in. Alright, everyone, welcome to this course titled Linux for ethical hackers. Before we get started, I'd like to do a little Who am I so my name is Heath Adams. I also go by the cyber mentor. I am a husband, first a hacker, a military veteran, gamer sports fan and animal Dad, I am a former accountant turned security geek. So I've been in cybersecurity about three years now. And before that, I was an accountant, I hated it pick that that field for all the wrong reasons. So once I went into it, and cybersecurity, I never looked back. And I've never been happier. On the day to day, I am a senior security engineer. I'm also a business owner at TCM security. So before that I was a senior penetration tester doing penetration testing and ethical hacking, I branched out and started my own business focusing on ethical hacking, training and student development. So now I'm doing that full time, along with a job as a senior security engineer. Okay, so let's go ahead and talk about what we'll learn in this course. So this course is going to be all hands on. Besides this little introduction here, you're not going to see a lot of PowerPoint besides quick overview of what the course or the video that you're about to see has coming. So 95% hands on course, I will not kill you with PowerPoint. That's not my goal. We're going to be focusing on Kali Linux this entire course, and really learning Linux and learning Linux for the purpose of becoming ethical hackers. So we're going to install VMware, which is a virtualized software, virtualization software, and then we're going to run Kali Linux inside of VMware. After that, I'm going to give you a overview of Kali Linux, show you some of the common tools, what it can do, why it's awesome. And then we're going to do a deep dive into the terminal. So what that means is we're going to be hands on doing commands and learning Linux. So we'll be running, navigating the file system. So how to get around in the file system from the terminal, we'll learn about users and privileges, how to add users how to what kind of privileges and permissions are there what important files exist regarding those, we're going to talk about common network commands. So if you want to be a pen, tester, or ethical hacker, you need to know networking, at least at a basic minimum. So we'll talk about those common network commands that you should know how to run them what they do, we'll talk about viewing, creating and editing files. That's obviously important if you want to create a quick file or edit a file from the command line, how you can do that. We'll talk about starting and stopping services such as a web server, SSH, SQL database, etc. We're going to talk about how to install updates, how to install tools and how to update those tools. And then lastly, we're going to put everything we learned together and do some scripting in bash. So we're going to write a basic bash script, and then we'll improve upon it and then I'll show you some four loops, some other logical scripting ideas, and then we'll kind of put that together and hopefully, come to a nice completion when it's all said and done. So with all this being said, I'm excited to have you in the course with me, I look forward to teaching you and let's go ahead and start with installing VMware. Alright, the first thing that we're going to need to do is to install software called VMware Workstation player. Now we have two ways to run Kali Linux, we can either run Kali Linux through a virtual machine, or we can install it as an operating system on a hard drive for this course, and this lesson, we're going to be using a virtual machine. and preferably, we're going to be using VMware Workstation player. I'm going to show you how to install VMware Workstation player and I'll show you some of the alternatives to it as well. So let's go ahead and dive right in. Okay, so if you go out to the interweb, and you go to Google, and you type in VMware Workstation player, the first thing that will come up for you is this download VMware Workstation player link. You're going to go ahead and just click on this and now I also want to introduce alternatives. So there is a another software platform called Oracle VirtualBox. And you will be able to install either my preference in the course that's going to be taught the rest of the way through is going to be in VMware Workstation Pro. But we will use player for the install, you'll be able to follow along with player you will also be able to follow along with Oracle VirtualBox if you so choose. But we will not be showing that installation. Another thing that should be noted is there is this comparison page here and I will be using VMware Workstation Pro. There's a nice little checklist here that shows what pro can do versus player, he has a lot of the same features here. Some of the nice things is running multiple VMs at once. You can technically do that with VMware Workstation player, there's workarounds for it. But to have it in a single tabbed interface. It's very, very nice. You see here, the drag will tabbed interface. That's another feature snapshots. So basically making a backup of your machine all included in workstation Pro. So if you have some money to shell out, and this is something that you're interested in doing long term, it may be worth looking into a workstation pro license, but by all means you can get away with a workstation player installation, and that's exactly what we're going to do. So let's go back to the first tab here. And you can see it says try VMware Workstation player, we're just going to scroll down and this install and everything is going to be running on top of windows for me. If you're installing for Linux, that's fine as well just follow your instructions for your respective OS. Go ahead and select Download now. I'm going to save the file. Okay, it downloaded I'm going to hit run. It's going to ask if we want to accept the changes, yes. Okay, now we're going to hit Next we'll accept the license agreement and possibly give away our firstborn. I'm going to go ahead and check yes, for the enhanced keyboard driver. We don't need to check for product update, we don't need to join the VMware customer experience improvement. We'll hit Next on that, you can leave both of these checked or check to your preference. And then hit install. And while this is installing, I can actually show you what VMware pro looks like. This is a pro instance running here you can see they have the tabs and they're draggable as it was notated in that, that differential spreadsheet that you saw, and I've got a Cali instance running, that's actually my main Cali machine. I've got windows 10 running here. And this is all actually sitting on top of a real windows 10 machine as well. So we're just installing workstation player, I'm going to run a VM inside of a VM. So this can be a little bit of Vm ception here, and then we're just going to hit finish. And then we are going to restart this machine as it needs a reboot real quick. Okay, now we are restarted and we're back to our desktop here, you can see that VMware Workstation player has been added to the desktop. Let's just go ahead and double click that to open it. And we're going to choose to use VMware Workstation 15 player for free for non commercial use. If we wanted the pro edition, we would enter in our access key here license key and continue on with the pro edition. And now we will use the Finish button here and we will be brought to our VMware Workstation 15 player. So you can see here that it's a much different view, it's very, very basic. We have the option to open a VM here and we'll have the one VM stored in this tab that we can open up and that'll be it. There are ways around running multiple VMs at the same time, but if you're looking to build a fluid lab out and have multiple VMs running similar to what I have here, having the VMware pro again, it does have its benefits here. So you can see this is a much much different look. This is very generic as we we can see here. So from here, what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and stop in the next video, we are going to focus on downloading Kali Linux and we'll talk about what Kali Linux is and some of its features as well. So I'll catch you over in the next video. Alright, now let's move on to installing Kali Linux in our VMware software. Okay, so picking up where we left off we had just installed VMware Workstation 15 player, and now we need a VM to actually be able to play with it. So this whole course is going to be based on Kali Linux. If we open up a internet browser here, I've got a few tabs already opened. So what I want you to do is go ahead and go out to Google, and just type in Cali k L, I Linux download, and leave it here. What we're going to do as well is I want to talk just a quick second about what Kali Linux is. So Kali, Linux is a Debian based Linux OS. So it's based on pen testing tools, and it's made for pen testers. So what it does is it comes preloaded with a bunch of penetration testing tools, a toolkit, if you will call it and it is just made for people who are looking to do pen testing. So this is provided by offensive security. If you come to cali.org. And you look at the About Us, it provides a little bit of information about who the core developers were and some of the moderators. But basically, what it is, is it followed up a tool called or distribution called backtrack. So the new the new tool is Kali Linux. Now there are alternatives out there. One of the alternatives right now is called parrot. So if you go to parrot sec.org, and you look into what is parrot, you can see that they have different distributions. And they talk about why parrots different, but they do have a pen test distribution here. So for this course, we're going to be using Kali Linux, but I always do like to introduce the alternatives. Kali Linux is probably more popular at this point, parrot OS is kind of on the newer side, some people are starting to get behind it and liking it, but I would say Kali still dominates. The third option is that you set up your own distribution. So you have an OS that you like, and then you install the tools on the OS that you like, and you have your own custom build. So some people feel like, you know, Kali, or even parrot, they come with a bunch of tools that they'll never need. So their systems bloated, and they really just have a set amount of tools that they like, and if there's a tool that they want to add into the system, then they'll download that on their own. They don't want to have a ton of bloatware coming with their system. But with my experience in the industry, mostly everybody that I've worked with is using Kali Linux, some people are doing their own builds, especially on like the webapp pen testing side. And then now parrot is kind of that up and coming Oh s that some people are transitioning to, but it is predominantly Kali Linux. So that is why we're doing this course in Kali Linux. And I feel like it's the best option for us to learn some, just some basic Linux skills and learning in the OS that is the most dominant in the industry right now. So let's go ahead and go back to that Kali Linux download. In while this link has been clicked on, do not let it fool you. We're actually not clicking on the official Kali Linux downloads page, we're going to scroll down a little bit, I want to go to the Kali Linux custom image downloads page and I'll show you why here. So this is that offensive dash security Comm. Make sure that's the one you're following along with. And if you scroll down just a bit, you see that they're providing us VMware images and VirtualBox images. So remember, when I told you that VirtualBox was an option, if you chose that option, here you go right here, you'll click on this tab and you will download the VirtualBox image. Now what we're going to be doing is we're going to be running Kali Linux, VMware 64 bit and we're going to download this seven zip right here. You also have the option to download a torrent if you'd like the file size is going to be 2.4 gigs. So it might take you a minute depending on your your speed of your internet. And they also provide a Sha 256 some if you want to check the file when you download it. So I'm going to go ahead and just hit download on this. And I'm going to save it and I will come back as soon as this file is finished downloading. Okay, so my file has finished downloading, I'm going to navigate to the folder where it has downloaded to which is the Downloads folder. And you can see here that is a seven zip file. So my installation by default does not have seven zip. If you do not have seven zip either. We can go ahead and download that together. So if you go out to Google and you just type in seven zip, the first thing that comes up is seven dashes zip.org. You'll see a download tab here just go ahead and click on that link and go ahead and download the executable for your respective operating system. So for me, I'm going to be downloading the 64 bit Windows version here. And I'm going to hit save, I'm going to hit Run, say yes, I'm going to go ahead and install to the default directory. Okay, now that's installed, let's go back to our folder. And let's select that we open with seven zip here. Okay, now let's see if we can drag and drop, we can, so all I'm doing is dragging and dropping, I'm putting it in the Downloads folder, you don't have to do that you can drag it and put it in a location that you would prefer, this is going to extract I believe at a larger file size than just the 2.5 gigs that we downloaded the 2.4 gigs. So make sure that you have file space where you're going to put this. So I'm gonna go ahead and let this finish and then I will be right back. Okay, so I've successfully unzip this file. And just for the record, if we hover over it, you can see that it actually extracted to be 10.4 gigabytes. So let's make sure that wherever you extract it to you have the 10.4 gigabytes in order to successfully complete the extraction. So from here, let's go ahead and open up our VMware Player. And we're going to go to player up in the left hand corner, we're going to select file, and then we're going to select open. And then we're going to go to downloads. And we're going to go into our Kali Linux folder here, and or wherever you put it, if you didn't put it in the Downloads folder, and then just select the one item that should be here. It's a little four kilobyte file. And what this does for us is it automatically has a build, that's just ready to go. So this is really awesome. We don't have to download the image itself, and then install it and then pick all the features. No, this just ready to go for us. So we can also come down here and select Edit virtual machine settings. And there are a couple features here. So depending on the amount of memory that you have on your machine, so right now this is sitting at two gigs of RAM, that's fine. If you want it to run faster, I recommend going somewhere between four and eight. Obviously, the more RAM you give it the the better it's going to perform. But if you're running on eight gigs of RAM for your machine, really not going to do well for you. My recommendation is no more than a fourth. So if you're running on 16, then maybe give this four, you could really try pushing it up to eight. But I am running on 32 right now. So I could crank this up to eight by my rule here. But just for working with you and following along, I'm going to set this to two and then we're going to perform into that way that we are working at the same speeds across the board. Another thing that we need to know is the network adapter, by default, it's set to net, we're going to go ahead and just leave that Nat here, Yours may come set to bridge if for some reason it's set to bridge, you can try that. But my default preference is Nat. So let's go ahead and just hit OK. Okay, and now we're just going to hit play virtual machine. And a little side note, I am actually now on my OS, I'm running on my, my Windows OS as opposed to just running inside the VM. If I was running a VM inside of the VM, I'd have a lot of issues, segregation, etc. So now I've actually moved out of the VM and have this running and player on my Windows OS. Okay, and then when we get this pop up here, go ahead and just say I copied it. And this will start the machine. And you can see the other VMware Player back here, it's going to go ahead and directly just start loading up here and we get to this screen. So we click in and if we try to just enter in our username and password, our username by default is going to be root. Our password is going to be root backwards, so t o r and then hit enter. Now we can make this full screen over here by clicking this button. It will enter into full screen mode. We are now successfully logged into our Kali Linux machine. We've installed this successfully and now we are ready to start learning. So that's it for this video in the next video we're going to be doing is we're going to cover some of the tools and features of Kali Linux. And we'll start talking about what it's capable of and then we'll dive right into the terminal after that and start learning some. So command line and some useful tools with Linux. So I will catch you guys in the next video. All right, now let's take a look around Kali Linux, and just see what it has to offer us in terms of tools, design, etc. So let's dive right in. Okay, so we're at our desktop here inside of Kali Linux. Now you see the Kali Linux logo, you see, there's a couple of things on the desktop, you don't have to worry about these. These are just from VMware themselves put on your desktop. If you install this as an actual OS, this will not be here. So when we talk about navigating around Kali Linux, there's a couple places that we can look, if we look right away, you can see on the left hand side over here, we've got a favorites bar. So we've got our folders. So if we click on the folders or files, we can navigate around this feels like any other machine, right? We have our documents, downloads, music, pictures, if you're a Windows user, or Mac user, whatever this feels pretty common. So this is a GUI or graphical user interface way of interacting with the folders. As you move on, and we move on in this course, we're going to be living in the terminal. So the terminal is right here. If you click on the terminal, this is something similar to your command line. So from here, we can actually navigate to all these folders here. And we can put files in there take files out anything that we can do in a graphic point of view, we can also do from this command line point of view as well. So as we learn, we're going to get a little less relying on the graphical interface. And more on the terminal side of things, however, do know that there are ways to do a lot of things from a graphical side, if you still need that, that interaction with the machine and you don't want to be completely keyboard oriented. There are also tools on the side over here, if we look, we've got a leaf pad. So leaf pad is just like a notepad, right, or, you know, just your notebook here, you can take some quick notes, save it out, should be pretty familiar for you as well. So they've got Firefox, it used to be called iceweasel. And that's just your web browser. Down here are some of the tools that you may use. Now, burp suite is a very popular tool for web application penetration testing, we're not gonna be getting into any of these tools at the moment. But I will cover what a couple of them do. So again, burp suites, a web application penetration testing tool, if you ever get into web app, or if you even get into some basic pentesting, chances are you're going to start using burp suite on a pretty regular basis. Over here is Zen map. Now this is the graphical version of a tool called n map. And you will be using n map pretty religiously when you're doing pentesting. So if you like a visual view of doing scanning, so n map is a network mapper, it allows you to scan machines for open ports, and for vulnerabilities. So if you want that in a more of a visual type of view, or graphical interface type view, then you have Zen map as a feature. This little guy down here is meta sploit. Now meta sploit is a tool that can be taught all these are tools that can be taught in deep, deep lessons all by themselves, not to make that intimidating for you at all. Just know that that's how robust This is we're looking at three tools right here, and they're all very, very powerful. And this isn't even the half of it or the quarter of what Kali Linux has to offer. So meta splay, you may have heard of it. If you've heard of anything in pen testing, it is a framework that does just a little bit of everything. So a lot of pen testers live and die by this. It's a fantastic tool in my opinion. And you're going to get very, very intimate with it very, very quick if you do move into pentesting. Down here is a tool called cherry tree and that's pretty much where I'm going to stop we've got multigo in Kismet, these are just this is wireless base and this one here is is information gathering base, but cherry trees Another useful one. If we open that up. This is actually another note keeping tool like I showed you leaf pad leaf pads just for quick little one offs. cherry tree is more of note keeping as a whole. So you've got nodes that you can add so you can add a node here and just say say you're following along and you want to add notes. You can say Linux you know and then you have a note You can add all of your notes in here. And then you can actually add children nodes as well. So maybe there's a command that you want to add in. So say, we're covering commands and you want to write all the commands in about Linux down here, you could do that as well. And then save this out. Nice thing too, is that you can take screenshots and put them in here. And exports really nice. And this is going to be very, very useful for anything in your career. But when it comes to pen testing, there are so many tools, so many commands that I think it is incredibly important to be able to take notes and cherry tree is built in already. Personally, I use what used to be in Kali Linux, which is a tool called keep note, but cherry tree is a great alternative as well. So either of them would work in i is highly recommended by me that you use some sort of note keeping tool as you go through your courses and get better as a pen tester. So I'm going to close out of this here. And I want to show you a couple more things, you have a feature here where you can show all of your applications. So if you click on that, it'll bring up all the applications, including the ones that are grouped down here. Another way to do this is if we come up into applications at the top, you can see that everything is grouped really nice for you. So it goes through the steps of penetration testing. And let's say that like, a, I'm gathering information on a client, okay, well, here are some of the built in tools for information gathering right here. Say you want to do a wireless assessment, and you want to do that those sorts of attacks, you've got all these wireless tools built in for you right here. Now chances are, you're going to be running these tools from the command line. So again, you know, you don't want to get too hung up on the graphical side of things, as you may not always have access to that either. But it's important to know what tools that you have in front of you. And there are even tools like Wireshark in here. So very, very useful, pretty much a little bit of everything that you can imagine. So just, you know, take some time and go through the tools. And if you're becoming a pen tester, you're working on it, you know, just just, you know, look at a tool and do some research on it. Say you want to know what this MAC changer is. It might be obvious, it might not be obvious, right? So maybe you go Google, what Mac changer does, how to use it, what the syntax is, and then you play around with that, pick a new tool every day, figure out something that you can do with it, how to use it what it does. But so Kali Linux is a distribution full of useful tools. And it it you know, for a base OS, it's fantastic. And this is why so many people in the industry, just download this, install it and they're ready to go. You know, we talked about in a previous video, how there are other OSS or there are people out there that like to just do their, their base install. And you can see that there's bloatware here, if you want to call it that, right. Like there's forensic tools. And maybe you'll never do any forensics in your life. And you don't need all this installed in your system. So if you're a type of person that is, you know, it doesn't want this extra stuff, there's extra software on your system, okay, then maybe you do start moving towards that custom build. Eventually, in your career, you say, hey, I want I want to learn all these things first. And then once I learned what tools I really like, then maybe you move to your own distribution that you create yourself. And you spin that up every time instead of having all these tools built in. But as a basis as something that you can learn from and start with. This is why I've chosen Cali and this is why we're going to learn it today. So let's go ahead. From here, what we're going to do is we're going to dive right into the terminal. So let's just open this terminal. And then we're going to fullscreen it and move on to next video. So from here on out, what we're going to be doing is we're going to be living in this terminal. I'm going to back away from the graphical side of things and really just get your your hands dirty, in the terminal make you feel comfortable. If you've never used Linux before, this is perfect for you. So I'm going to give you the the pen tester perspective on why we're doing a lot of these things. Some of these commands are going to be the same commands, regardless if it's on a Kali Linux machine or if it's on another distribution of Linux. So you'll be able to take a lot of these commands and just use Linux and another system as well. So if you're interested in pentesting, if you're interested in Linux, this is where we really get into the meat of the course and it should get interesting for you. So I will catch you over the next video we're going to start talking about how to navigate File System and get comfortable with that. Alright, on to navigating the file system. So first let's talk about some of the commands we're going to learn today. So we're going to learn about pwd, which is present working directory, we're gonna learn about CD, which is how we change directories. We're going to learn about LS, which is going to be listing the files in a folder or in a directory. And we're also going to talk about how to find some hidden folders with LS. We'll talk about how to make a directory and to remove a directory, we're going to talk about copying, removing moving and locating files. We'll talk about something called update DB and how that pertains to locating files. We'll talk about the password and how to change our password. And we'll talk about an important command called man. So by the end of this first lesson, you should be pretty comfortable with all of these commands and may seem a little daunting, but they all kind of play in with each other. Again, please make sure to take notes you got cherry tree built in. You can also use keep note or even just a notepad in front of you, that'll help with the experience. And also maybe watching the video more than once will help with the experience as well. So let's go ahead and dive right into the command line. So now our first lesson in Linux terminology is going to be navigating the file system. So if you're a Windows user, you're used to navigating your file system probably through folders through a GUI, so a graphical user interface. Well, in Linux, we can do that. But the majority of time we're going to live in this terminal here. So we really need to know how to get around. So the first thing we can do here is we can say Hey, where are we at? And that's a pwd. So that stands for present working directory. So you type that in, you hit Enter. And it says, Okay, we're in the root folder. So we know that we're in the root folder, but how do we get out of the root folder, we can use a command called CD. And that stands for change directory. So if we want to change directory backwards, we just type in two dots here. And now we can say, okay, where are we at? So we're in a slash. So we're just in a home folder here are just there our generic slash folder, right? So what we can do is, well, how do we know Can we go backwards? from here? Let's keep trying. So we do pwd. Again, no, we can. This is our base folder, right? So you have to think of this as the lowest you can go. So now how do we move around? How do we know how to go forwards again? Well, we don't know what's in our directories, right? So we're sitting in this the slash folder, and how do we look around? So there's a command called ls that lists everything that's in the folder. So if we say LS, we kind of see this color coordinated here. And the color coordination just depends on if it's a folder if the folders read, right, you know, there's permission settings, which we're going to get into later. But the majority of these here are folders. Okay, well, we know we just came out of root so we can go back into root. Now, how do we do that? So we can say, change directory root. And we can actually hit tab to autocomplete. I don't know if you caught that. But there's no are any folder besides root. So at all, I can just hit tab. And it should type it out for me. Oh, I lied. There's a run in here somewhere, but it's hidden. We're gonna cover that soon as well. So our Oh, hit tab, autocomplete can change directory into root. So let's LS and root and see what's in here. Okay, this is more like our home folder, right? So we've got desktop documents downloads, this is kind of what applies to the root user. So what if we're sitting in this root folder here and we wanted to access instead this Etsy folder? Well, could we do the same Etsy command here? Well, I'm hitting tab, and nothing's happening. Well, because Etsy doesn't belong in this area, right. But if we put a forward slash in front of it, because this is the base, and then we hit et CIE, there, now we can navigate to the Etsy folder, and we can actually double tab and see what's all in the Etsy folder like an LS, se no. Another way to do that is if we wanted to LS what's in the Etsy folder without navigating to it, we can just type ls Etsy, and you can see everything that's in here. So there's some some tricks that we can do right? So we don't have to actually navigate to the folder to know what's in there. Again, if we LS. And we want to know what's sitting in videos, or even, let's say what's sitting in desktop for our folder, well, if we start typing desktop and hit tab, we can't do that either. Because everything in Linux is case sensitive. So if we start typing desktop, and then hit tab, now, we can LS and see what's in there. So our VM ware came with a couple of shell scripts here that are automatically placed on our desktop, we wanted to confirm that you could see that they're both right here. So as of right now, we are just sitting in our route home folder. And we know how to navigate around. So if we wanted to go to desktop, we could, we could hit LS now and see what's in there. If we wanted to go backwards, we could. Okay, now we're back in our, our root folder. And you can also tell where you're at your present working directory sits right here, right. So this little a Tilda is actually your home folder. And you can see that we're in desktop. So if we wanted to go back into our desktop, instead of typing, so you want it to go to music from your desktop, instead of going route music, which will work, you could also just say I want to go music. And that'll put you there as well. And notice you don't need the leading forward slash when you use the automata. So just some couple interesting tricks that you will kind of pick up along the way, tab is definitely going to be your best friend. If you run into something with multiple options, say you're trying to CD and you say I want to go on my desktop and you're tabbing it's not working, you can hit double tab, and then it'll show you Okay, well, there's desktop documents, downloads, those are your three options, start with a D. So now you kind of have an idea as to how to kind of move around. But let's do a little bit more. So what if we want to make our own folder? Well, there's something called make directory, MK Dir. So if we say make directory, and we'll say I'm just gonna use my name here. So now if we LS, we can see that this he folder is now here, we can go into the heat folder. And there should be nothing in it right? So we can go back. And we can also get rid of the heat folder, remove directory heat, the LS again, it's gone. So now, what else can we do? Well, we can also look for hidden folders. So we can say LS dash LA. And we can look for hidden files and folders here. Remember the color coordination. So this dot cash, right that in theory is a hidden folder. So if we say CD dot cash, we can go into there we LS and there's actually some some information in there. But when you saw it originally, you didn't see that, we're going to cover more on this, I just kind of want to show you that trick. As you see over on the left side, there's file permissions and properties. So be aware that just because it looks like something's not there, doesn't mean it's not there, it might just actually be hidden similar to Windows where you have hidden files and folders. So just a quick trick to show you that. So another thing we can do. So let's go back. And don't worry about what I'm doing here, you're going to cover these commands in a little bit. I'm just going to echo Hi, and we're going to put that in a test dot txt folder. So now if we LS, you can see that test dot txt is here. So if we want to actually copy this file, we can copy this file to another location. So we can say, hey, I've got this test dot txt, but I actually want to move it to downloads. And if we go LS to downloads, you can see that test dot txt is actually sitting in there. And if we wanted to remove it, we can just say remove from downloads, or test dot txt. Actually, sorry, remove downloads test dot txt, we don't have to transition into that directory if we don't want to. So another trick, say we want to see now that it's gone. We want to LS but we don't want to keep typing this out. If you hit the up arrow. Now you can just see your old commands. So if you keep typing your command over and over, you can see what's going on. So LS shows that there's nothing in downloads now we were able to successfully remove that file. So another thing that we can do is we can actually move so say we wanted to move test dot txt and we wanted to put that In the downloads, okay, now if we LS test dot txt is now gone from this folder. Because we've moved it, we haven't made a copy, we've actually physically moved it away. So now if we LS Actually, let's just tab up, you can see that test dot txt is now in there. I'm going to remove that here. Okay, and now the last thing I want to show you, is the locate feature. So if we wanted to locate a file, say I wanted to locate bash, let's see. So we're looking for a file, and we're going to get more specific along the way. But if you type in locate, you can kind of look through a system to see if you can find it. Now I'm looking for, say, any type of bin bash or bin or bash, that's fine. That's really what I wanted. But it shows you everything with bash in it. Now, this might not work right away, what you might need to do is update the database. So you type in update dB, it updates everything for you. And then you can use locate again. So it has to build that database of the information that it's finding in order to locate what you're searching for. So make sure that you use update DB sort of frequently. Okay, so two more things I want to show you. And then we'll close out this video and move on to the next one. So an important thing you want to do with your new account is we're using a default password, and that's not very secure. So to change a password for our user, we can just type in pa SS WD. And now it's going to ask us for a new password. So instead of using tour, we can use something else. I'm going to type in the very secure password as my password for an example here. But if you plan on using this machine, for future reference, you can type in a secure password and kind of keep it. So lastly, I want to show you is something called man. So man pages, man pages are your instructions for any command that you're running. Most commands come with a man page. So let's say we want to look at LS, we can say man LS. And then it's going to give us all this information here about LS. So if you see it says LS is list directory contents. Awesome. And then it gives you what options we can do. Well, we can do a dash a for all what you saw earlier. And you can kind of scroll through here and just see exactly what it has to offer. And that's kind of it. So when you go through here, you can kinda you know, if you're struggling to like, you know, there's a command in there, but you're not sure exactly what the command is, you can type in man and search it. And sometimes you can do LS, I don't know if this is going to work, but dash dash help. And you get some information as well. It doesn't provide you the full man pages, but it provides you something pretty close. So that's kind of just your way around if you ever get stuck, something to look for. Okay, so that's it for this lesson. Next, we're going to move on to users and privileges, how to add users and how to how to change some pseudos and some modifications to our file permissions. So until next time, my name is Heath Adams, and thank you for joining me. Alright, now let's talk about users and their privileges. So what are we going to learn in this lesson, we'll do a quick user privilege overview. From there, we're going to talk about the CH mod command, which is the change mode command, that's going to let us change the permissions on a file or directory. We're also going to talk about how we're going to add a user with the Add User command. From there, we're going to take a look at a couple of important files. One is the Etsy password file. And the other is the Etsy shadow file. So the Etsy password file is not actually where the passwords are stored on a machine. That is the Etsy shadow file which stores the hashes. But the Etsy password file does store it where the users what users are on the machine. And you can correlate that to the shadow file. So we'll talk about those in more detail and their importance to pentesting. Very, very important. And then we're going to talk about su which is the switch user command. And finally, we'll talk about sudo, which is a command that allows you to elevate your privileges on a Linux machine. So let's go ahead and dive right into our lesson. Okay, so now we're going to cover users and privileges. So in the last video, we touched a little bit on privileges with our LS dash l A. And we touched a little bit on users by changing the password of our root account. So now we'll cover a few more commands regarding those. So if we look at ls dash l A. You could see all this crazy, jumbled wordage over here, right? So it actually means something. So we look at the first line here, if we see a dash, like this a hyphen, that means it's a file. If we see a D, that means it's actually a directory. And then you see our W and x. So rW x actually means read, write, execute. It's the permission settings that this particular group has. Now there are three groups here, there's the first, second, and then your third right here, right? So your first group, right here is the owner of the file. So it looks like the owner of the file has full READ WRITE execution, right. And then the next set of three here is actually the permissions for the members of the group that owned the file. So this is a group ownership as opposed to actual ownership here. So for the people that are in the group that has access to this file, they can only read and execute, they can't write to it. Now, for the last one, this is just all their users. So any common user here can actually just read and execute, they can't write the document. So that comes into play, especially when we get into penetration testing, because with penetration testing, we're looking to have full access, right, so we're always gonna be looking for that folder that has full READ WRITE. Typically, if we look at temp, that's our temp folder. A lot of times, you see the temp folder has full read, write, execute. So when we're doing penetration testing, we're trying to upload some sort of exploit, we might actually upload it into the temp folder, because that's where we can execute those, those files. However, we could also be looking for other full READ WRITE execute files, where we need to modify them and give us root access to a system. So it's all about insecure configurations. And we're going to cover that more once we get into the actual penetration testing part of the course. So for the Linux essentials part of the course, all we need to worry about is these file permissions. Another important feature of that is if we were to create a script, or scripts not gonna be able to run until it has full access. So how do we change access here. So let's make a file. I'm just going to make all this echo another text document, right, so we'll just say hello. And actually, I typed that in backwards. So hello, and we'll call it Hello dot txt. So if we LS here, by default, we only have read write and then read access for everybody else. Meaning if we wanted to read it, we could say cat, which we're going to get into later. Cat Hello, dot Tex, and it just says hello. So what can we do here? Well, we can use something called change mode, in changing mode is CH, Mo D. And we have a couple options here. So we can do a plus, right, and we could say, well, we want READ WRITE, execute, or we just want execute. But another way I like doing it is you have a number feature. So the one you really need to know is all sevens. sevens gives you full read write access across the board. So if we say ch mod 777 Hello dot txt. Now we LS LA. And you notice that Hello dot txt turns green, that means it is full rewrite. And here you go. We've got the dash here saying it's a file, and we've got READ WRITE execute across the board. So this is how we change file permissions. You don't need to necessarily know about the other numbers in terms of penetration testing, it becomes more in terms of configuration and security management of files if you were to get down that path. So just stay on the easiest path. Just remember 777 or plus x will work as well. So changing the mode is is critical. And we're going to cover it time and time again throughout the course, once we get a little bit deeper. So a couple more things we need to talk about. say we wanted to add a new user. Well, there's a feature called Add User. So we say Add User, and one or two names is allowed. So we need to add user to john. Okay, so it made something for john. Let's give him a password. Give them a password again. And we'll just hit enter for the default. It's all correct. Okay, so We now have a user named john. And we can confirm that we can actually cat The Etsy password file here. And you see down at the very bottom, we have this user, john. So this Etsy password file you're going to become very familiar with, because it shows you all the users now this will, there's a lot of times when you're doing penetration testing, you're gonna have access to this Etsy password file, because it doesn't provide the password anymore, it used to a long time ago, passwords are now in the shadow file. So you actually have a little bit of access and information disclosure here at the hands of poor configuration. So you see that I've created a user john, well, that gives us a little bit of information, say there's SSH on a machine or something else, we can use that username for john to try to break into the machine. So we'll cover that again later. But if we wanted to see what the Etsy shadow file looks like, now we come in here, and you've got these, these jumbled stuff here, right? So it's just a hashing format. So what we're doing is we can actually use a tool like hash cat to break this down and crack these passwords. Now, a password of password will be very easy. But just know that if you have access to the Etsy shadow file, you have a good chance of cracking a password, depending on your capabilities, and depending on the strength of the password, that allow you access to a machine. So something to think about there. Okay, so now we have our user john, let's go ahead and switch to him. So we can use something called Su, which stands for switch user. And we'll say switch user, john. Okay, so automatically gave us john here, let's see if we could switch back to root. Okay, we can't just switch back to root, because we need roots password, right? So we can type in password, and that works. But if we didn't know the password, then we'd be stuck on john, we are able to access john because we were already root. So this comes into play in terms of users. Let's go back to john here. Now, if your user you have to be able to do certain things, you need permission to do certain things I should say, right, so root has full access and permission to do everything. But john, we just created john john doesn't have any sort of access. So if we wanted to, if we wanted to change the password, say we want to change the password for for root. I can't modify the password information because I don't have that kind of access. Now there is something called a pseudo which would provide john the access if we gave it to him. So it's called a sudoers file. And basically, anybody in that sudoers file can change permissions given if they are a pseudo user, right? So we would type in sudo, password root. And it's going to ask for the password for john. But you're going to notice, hey, John's not in the sudoers file, john can't do this. So john has base permissions, right. And we're going to counter that a lot of times in penetration testing, where if we get in, we'll get something called lower privilege. And we'll get an account like john, and we're going to try to escalate into root but we just can't do it, you know, the chances of doing a doing that and having a john in a sudoers file is just not high. It's possible, but it's not likely. So for now, just know that if you want a user other than root, to have access to file permissions, you need to have them in the sudoers file, that becomes useful to in penetration testing, because you can look at the sudoers file if you have access to see what users have sudo privileges. Okay, so that is it for this lesson. In the next lesson, we're going to be covering network commands, and moving on gradually towards scripting. So let's go ahead and get there. And I will see when we get over there. Alright, so now we're going to be covering common network commands. So before we dive into the commands we're going to learn, I'm going to go on a tiny bit of a rant here. So if you are not familiar with networking, now's the time to become familiar with networking. There are two things I think that a person needs before they really can dive into pentesting. And that is Linux experience, which you are gaining some Linux experience now because most pen testing is done in Linux. And the other thing is to have a good network foundation. So if you're looking at these commands here, and I say if config, which if you're a Windows user, and you hear IP config, do you know what that is? Okay, that's basically the same thing. If you know what ping is, if you know what ARP is netstat route, those should all be pretty familiar where you can guess what those are. If you do not know what these commands are, you might want to brush up on your networking as well. Because the better you are at networking, the better you're going to be when it comes to pentesting, because you're going to have to navigate around networks, you're gonna have to understand where you are at in a network, you're going to need it for basic troubleshooting as well. So just to understand these commands are gonna be very important. But what we're going to be doing here is we're going to be taking common network commands that we're going to be running as a pen tester. And we're just going to apply those to their version in Linux. Some of these may be familiar to you, some may be new to you. But we're talking here if config which is going to show us some information very similar to IP config in Windows, where we'll see our ipv4, ipv6 if we have it information, our MAC address, things along those lines, our subnet mask, etc. The IWC config is the wireless adapter version of that. Ping is a ping command, where we talk over ICMP, and we try to communicate to another machine to see if it's alive and responding back to us. We've got the ARP command, which just maps IP addresses to MAC addresses. And we've got netstat, which is just a command line tool that's going to allow us to display all connections and listening ports. And then finally, we've got route which displays our routing table. So we'll go ahead and take a little bit of a deep dive into those in this next lesson. And hopefully, this is a refresher for you. So again, if not, then you should be looking into some networking studies as well. Okay, so let's go ahead and dive right in. Okay, so now let's cover network commands. So the first command I want to cover is if config. So you may be familiar with the Windows version of this, which is IP config. And they pretty much do the same thing. So it shows you here, your different interface types and the IP address associated with them. So it's zero here, Ethernet zero, has an IP address of 190 2.1 68.13 2.164, you can see the netmask, the broadcast address, and you can see the MAC address as well. And we also have a loopback address here. Now, if your machine has a wireless adapter, or at some point, you want to do wireless penetration testing, you're going to need a W config. And you should not expect to see anything on this at the moment, unless you're using a laptop, then you actually might see configuration down here for it. If you would see something under IWA config, you would see like a W LAN one w land zero, something along those lines, okay, and another common command that we're going to see is going to be the ping command. So we can just type in ping, and the address that we're trying to talk to. So for example, I'm going to try to ping my home router. And I get talking back. So if I tried to ping something that wasn't in my network, like a 16.1, you're gonna see the results change. So with ping here, ping is going to be endless, until we hit something like Ctrl C to stop it, it'll ping forever. So I'm gonna hit Ctrl C again, and kind of show you the difference. So you see that we attempted to ping here. And we got replies, we got information back. Well, that's good. That means we're talking to the other machine, it says, Hey, are you there? It says, Yeah, I'm there. And we try to ping this machine here. But this machine's not talking back, it could mean that the machine is on the network, or that the machine is just blocking ICMP traffic. ICMP is a another word for Ping. So moving on to the next command, I want to show you ARP. So the best way I like to type in is ARP with a switch of a and ARP is just going to show you MAC addresses that it talks to and the IP address. Actually, I said that backwards, it's going to show you the IP address it talks to and the MAC address associated with it. So if an IP address reaches out, say 192168 15.1 talked out to this machine, it's gonna say okay, Hey, who are you? It's gonna send a broadcast message out to say who has this IP address? And then the IP address will respond and says, Hey, I do and this is my MAC address. So ARP is just a way of associating IP addresses with MAC addresses. And once you know that, you can also look at netstat So netstat dash a and O is another one of my favorite commands. And this shows you just the active connections that are running on your machine. So if we scroll way up, and you can just kind of see what's open and what's talking here, where this really comes in handy on a penetration test is to see if a machine is talking to somebody else. Same thing with ARP, you want to know what that machine is associated with? And is it talking to something on a port. So this is more just internal right now, but it's still good to know. So for example, if I were to open up a Firefox page and connect out to the internet, then I went and I did a netstat. Again, I would see information about that port being open and, and that I am going out with it. So just kind of keep that in mind. These are not commands that you really need to know in depth right now. Networking does come into play when you are doing penetration testing. But what we're going to cover these commands time and time. And again, I just wanted to give you a very brief introduction to them. Okay, in the last command that I have for you today is route C, if you type in a route that's going to print your routing table in the routing table is important because it tells you where your traffic exits essentially. So for this VM, my traffic is exiting on 19216813 4.0. So any traffic goes out of this 0.0 dot 0.0 gateway, in this range, right. So when it goes out this gateway, it's doing Nat so network address translation, and it's running off my computer. So the best examples aren't here. But it's important to know route as well, because there could be a machine that you're attacking that has multiple routes. So you might see a 134 and a 135. Because it has a dual home Nic meaning it has two NICs inside of it. So it's actually talking to a completely different network that you didn't know existed. So you might have been attacking one network on the 134 range, and then 135, just out there, and this computer can talk to both and until that point, you had no idea. And that's the idea of called pivoting when you switch a network from one to the other, but you're using a machine. So that's it for this lesson. In the next lesson, we're going to talk about viewing, creating and editing files. Okay, so viewing, creating and editing files. This section sounds exactly like what it is. We're going to talk about how to view create and edit files. Mainly, we're just going to be showing how to create quick text documents. But we'll teach you commands that will allow you to do further in the future, as you will see as we get further in the course and get into scripting. So let's go ahead and take a look at some of the commands that we're going to be learning. So some of the commands that we're going to learn, we're going to learn the echo command, which echoes what we write right back out to the terminal, we're going to look at the cat command, which is going to print out a document for us it's similar to type in Windows, we'll talk about replacing versus appending. And which, which function does which and how to do it. We're going to talk about the touch command, which can be used to create a file on the fly. We'll talk about nano, which is a text editor that's built into the terminal. And then we're going to talk about g edit, which is also a text editor. But it is a GUI text editor. So we do get a little bit of gooey in this lesson. So let's go ahead and dive right in. Okay, so this is my second time recording this video. The first time I forgot to turn my microphone on and performed for my cat. So she approved of it. Let's see if you approve of it the second time around now that I have a little bit of practice. So we're gonna be talking today is really talking about viewing, creating and editing files. So I've already showed you the echo command. If you recall, we used echo to create a file, right? We created a Hello dot Tex. And we can just echo Hello out to the terminal. We could say echo Hello, and I'll say hello back. So what we can do with echo is we can use it to write to a file. So if we were to say echo, hey, and then we write it to Hey dot txt. Well, we can look and see that hey, dot txt is here. And you can see my files from the previous one. So I'm trying to Come with more ways of saying hello. But we're going to use hate text here. So if we cat hate at tax, a all cat does is print out to the screen what is in a file? It says, Hey, okay, so let's say we want to append cat are we want to append hate. txt? Well, we can tab up here. What if we just say, hey, again, we've got this greater than symbol here. And we're just putting it into the hate. txt file. Well, that didn't work. We didn't append it, we actually overrode it. So what if what what can we use to actually over append this, here's what we can do is we could say, hey, again, again, right? Just to give us something different. And we can add a second greater than symbol here. So now if we cat the file, you can see that we actually appended to the end of it. So this becomes incredibly useful when we are either adding stuff to a list say we're gathering IP addresses, and we just want to combine our lists, or when we're creating a series of commands, and we're going to use those commands to send all at once. We're going to cover that later, when we're talking about file transfers in the penetration testing section, where we use a set of commands like this on a Windows machine. To actually transfer files via FTP is just so much easier than typing them all in one by one, we can create a little document and run the document. So this becomes useful when we have a series of commands and for other reasons, as well as you'll learn as you go on in your Linux career. So we've talked about Echo, and we've talked about cat. So let's talk about some other ways to create a file, we can use something called touch, and to say New File dot txt. And if we LS, you can see that new file dot txt is here. But if we cat new file, there's nothing in there because they haven't put anything in there yet. So there's a few things that we can do, we could use echo and append the file, right? We can also use a tool called nano. nano is a terminal text editor. There are other terminal text editors like VI and vim. I don't prefer those Personally, I like now the most some people have their preferences. So I encourage you to play around with any of them as you wish VI and vim are the other two. But for this course, we're going to be using nano. So if I say nano, new file dot txt, I could type whatever I want in here. We're going to be using nano a lot to create scripts to create Python scripts. And to edit shellcode as we get into a little bit exploit development. So I'm going to hit Ctrl x, I'm going to hit y for saving, and then we'll save it to new file dot txt. If we cat this, now it says hey, I could type whatever I want in here. So that's one way of editing it. Another way of editing it is using a graphical interface. So we can use g edit, and say new file. And if you don't like using a terminal, you're more than welcome to use g edit here. Just type in new line here and save it. And I like using g edit, it's a lot cleaner, because I can you know, highlight and delete, I don't have to use my keyboard to navigate around like I do in the terminal. So if you have the option to use g edit for sure, but sometimes you're going to be on another machine that's not your own or is headless and doesn't have a GUI that you're going to have to use now. So get comfortable using both. So we save this, let's go ahead and cat it out and see what happens. Okay, you can see that the new line is in there. So really, that's the overview that I wanted to cover. So just know that you can create files pretty much using echo touch. And actually, you can create files using nano as well. If you say nano, this is new text. I'll just say hello, control x, save it, you LS you can see this is new text is right here. So you can use all of these tools in different ways to create files, it's completely up to you how you want to do it. Personally, when I'm creating a file, I use nano and I just create a new shell script Python script. txt document that way, you could also do it using g edit as well. So just know that we're going to be using these a lot and try to get comfortable with these. And from here, we're going to be moving into controlling callee services. So we're just going to briefly talk about what services you need running on boot and how to do that. All right, In this video, we're going to be talking about starting and stopping Cali services. Let's go ahead and just take a quick look at the commands we're going to learn. So not a lot of commands in this video only two, we're going to talk about the service command, and the system CTL command. So the service command deals with services, it's going to allow us to start and stop services on the fly. And the system CTL command is going to allow us to enable or disable services so that they load up on boot, or do not load up on boot. So let's talk a little bit more about services and look at how these commands can be useful for pentesting. Alright, so let's talk about starting and stopping services. So when we're in Cali, there are a couple different ways that we can start and stop services. And when I talk about a service, I'm talking about something like a web server, or SSH, or maybe a sequel database. So we cover this video today, I'm going to show you a few different services and how to start them and stop them. I'll show you how to start them permanently on boot. And we'll talk about which services are important to keep on boot, which services are important to start when you feel like that just starting them or when you need them, etc. So let's start with our first service, which is going to be Apache two. Now Apache two is a web server. So let's go ahead and do a proof of concept. First, let's start with a command that we learned in an earlier video, which is if config. I'm going to grab our ipv4 address right here. And I just want to copy this, I want to go out to a web browser over here. And we're just going to paste this address. Now you'll notice that it says it's unable to connect, this is expected here we're not running a web server. Now let's go back in here. And let's just say service, Apache to start. Okay, looks like it went through, let's go ahead and hit Enter again. And now you can see that Apache to Debbie and default page has been loaded. So what has changed? Well, when we boot our machine, this Apache two service is not running by default. So if we want to run a web page, then we actually have to start up the service for to work as you just saw here. Now you can see that if we want to add files or place files here, well, we're going to have to edit the var www HTML folder. So if we come out here, and we go into other locations computer, and then we go into our bar, www, HTML, you'll see that the index, that HTML page is here. So if we actually wanted to maybe host a malicious web page and have it pointed back to us, this is one way we might do it right here. If we want to serve up some files, say we have something that we want to upload to a machine that might be malicious, or, you know, a file that we want to transfer to somebody else or download on another computer doesn't have to be malicious, we could host that file in this folder here. Now that is fine. This is one way to do it, right, you can put your files all in one location. But you know, it's not my favorite way, it was my favorite way when I first got started. There is a much easier way now and I will show you how to do that. So let's go ahead and type ls, you'll see we have no documents here. So I'm just going to echo Hello into Hello dot txt, and then have that Hello dot txt here. Now what we can actually do is we can spin up a web server. So we can just say Python dash M for module and say simple HTTP server, you can auto tab it, and then say 80 for the Port 80 is already in use. So let's just give it 80 8080 is in use from the Apache server at the moment. So instead, let's look at what happens. So let's just call it out at 8080. And you can see here that I can go to this Hello dot txt and actually get the file, I have information in real time whether or not that file was captured. And overall, this is just a web server that's so easy to spin up, I can put it in the directory that I want it to. So if I wanted to serve my desktop folder, I would navigate to desktop and then spin this, this Python module up. I don't have to put everything into a VAR www folder. And it just makes life really, really simple. So just proof of concept. We can do a service, Apache to stop and we can come back and make sure that that web server has been stopped by going here. and refreshing. Now you can see that it's gone, we can CD into something like downloads, we say LS, there's nothing in here. So we can tab up a couple times, and just serve up Port 80. Now, because you can see it's not in use anymore. And come back here, refresh, you can see there's nothing in the directory listing, because there's nothing in the folder. So this is just an easy way to spin up a web server, I think it's much easier than Apache two, I'm showing you both because they like to give alternatives. But using Python moving forward is a great, great feature. My challenge to you is to look up how to spin up a FTP server with Python. So I won't get redundant here. I do have future lessons and other courses that talk about this. But if you want to challenge yourself to figure out how to spin up an FTP server, that's my challenge to you, there's a module out there that you can download quite easily and spin up your own FTP server. So let's go ahead and Ctrl C, and we're going to close out of this. And now let's talk about spinning up a service permanently. So let's say that we just had the Apache two running and then we rebooted the machine. When we reboot our machine. Apache two is not going to be online. Because we're only doing a service start, it only holds during this session. Once we reboot that it session is gone, that service is gone. So if we want to keep something online the entire time, what we can do is use system CTL. So we can say system CTL. Enable or Disable if you want to disable something. And for example, we can say SSH now I'm not going to hit enter here. This is just as an example. Let's say that we wanted to have an SSH available on our machine so we can SSH into it. We are opening up SSH for this feature here. Okay, let's say that we want to have a server and this is one I do want you to hit enter in. This is going to be a database, right? This is a PostgreSQL. So we're going to say systemctl enable PostgreSQL. And we have enabled that so now when we reboot this PostgreSQL will load every single time. Now, why is this important? Well, this is important because it's going to allow us to run meta sploit and have the PostgreSQL database running when we boot so it doesn't have to take the extra time to load it. If we come over here, and we just click on the meta sploit framework. Now PostgreSQL is working, and it says database already started. So it's already configured, it's going to skip initialization. And it's going to go ahead and get right into it. So it just says a little bit of time that display can take some time to to run. And I think that if you continue on, I know if you continue on with being a pen tester, you're definitely going to be using medispa quite a bit. So this is just one feature that if you're going to be using it, it doesn't hurt to have it enabled on your system boot. Now if you feel that you want to have a patchy two on boot, you can go ahead and do the same thing with the system enable systemctl enable, but the only one that I recommend putting on is this system CTL PostgreSQL. Okay, so that is it for this video. In the next video, we're going to be talking about installing how to install things from GitHub and how to install using apt get. So let's go ahead and move right into that video. All right, welcome to the Penn ultimate video, we are going to be focusing on installing and updating tools. So let's look at our agenda. So what are we going to learn we're going to learn how to install updates for Kali. So we're going to learn how to install updates using a tool called apt get. And we're also going to learn how to install tools using apt get specifically we're going to be installing a tool today called get we're going to be using Git then to clone from a website. So sometimes when we have a tool that we want, it's not always in apt get, it's not in the repository. So we're going to actually have to use GitHub and maybe use a tool called Git to download tools or other items from GitHub. But this is just going to be one example. But it's a very, very common example that you may have to do as a pen tester. So let's dive in and take a look at how we can use these commands to install tools and update tools. Okay, so one of the important things you need to know is how to not only install files on your computer, but also how to install updates on your computer. So for Cali, since it's a Debian base, we're going to use something called apt get and the first thing I'm going to show you is how to install updates. So the common way to Do this, if you don't use the GUI and you want to use the terminal is apt get update. And then we'll do and apt get, upgrade. Let's go ahead and just hit enter on this. Let's explain what it's doing. So the first command here is saying apt get update. So what we're doing is we're looking through packages. Now these packages are predefined the repositories. And what it does is it says, Okay, I'm going to check packages here for updates. And it went through looks like they use archive Linux, dude, it you, they check these packages here. And they update the packages. And then once they update the packages, they run this command. So basically, the Add command is you're going to do something as well, right? So first, we're going to update and then we're going to upgrade. So based on what's in these packages, it's gonna say, Okay, well, we know the following packages were automatically installed and no longer required. So all these things right here, they're gonna be removed. And then the following packages have been kept back, okay, they're fine. They're not going to uninstall those. And then we have the fine packages that are going to be upgraded. Okay, so it's a long list that needs updating. And then you come in here, and you say, Okay, well, it needs 252 megabytes of additional disk space to continue, you can hit enter for Yes. And it'll automatically start upgrading. So if you want to update your machine to its newest and best form, you can go ahead and do that, I'm going to go ahead and just hit no on this guy. Okay, and now, it's also important to know how to install files. So I'm going to show you two different ways. One way is through apt get similar to what we just did. And the other way is going to be through Git itself. So let's go ahead and install git, we're going to use apt get to install Git. So it will look something like this, we'll just say apt get install, get. And we'll hit yes on this. And another way to do this is to add a dash y at the end of this. So you'd say apt dash get install, get dash y. And that'll automatically say yes, if you just want to accept whatever's coming out for you, you go ahead and just hit yes on that. And it may take a minute for these to install. While this is installing, let's go ahead and talk about what Git does. So Git works with GitHub. So when we talk about GitHub, we're talking about a lot of people update their projects, their code, their frameworks onto GitHub, especially in the penetration testing slash hacking community, it's often that you're gonna find some cool tools that are out there that are installed on Kali Linux can't be found through apt get, and you have to actually download them from GitHub. So it's very important to know how to use Git. And it's very, very simple. So we're on a page like this. This is Vail framework. It's a very popular tool in penetration testing and malware analysis as well. So say we wanted to install this, well, there's a couple things we could do. The first thing we could do is always read the directions and see what they recommend. There is a quick install here. And if you look, they have a apt install Vale here with the dash y. So that will work. Or you can use gets install, where you have to install Git first. Okay, and then we do a git clone. And we run the configuration setup. So that's what we're going to do here, we're going to install Vail just for the fun of it, just so you can kind of get used to how to use GitHub how to use Git, and go from there. So let's go ahead and just Alt Tab back over looks like we have it, we can check it by typing Git and hitting tab. Okay, so Git is here. And we're just going to hit space, we know the command is clone. And while it provides it for us down here, it says, Hey, get clone, copy this. The other place you can do is right here where it says clone or download, you just copy this bad boy right here. We'll all tab back over to our terminal and just hit paste. Okay, and this is going to install in the directory that you choose. So I just put it in this root folder here. And actually our home folder I should say, and it's installed right here the folder is they all right here. Typically when I install things, I like to put them in the OPT folder. So here CD OPT, but since I went ahead and downloaded here, let's just go ahead for an example purpose. If you Do you want to install to object, you're more than welcome, you can move the folder there as well. So what we're gonna do is we're going to CD into Vail. And then we'll hit LS. Now remember, there were instructions. So let's go ahead and look at what those instructions were. These instructions said, you're going to run dot forward slash config. setup that sh, forced silence, let's go ahead and just copy this guy. We'll come back in here. And we'll hit paste. And it's just going to run out of this config folder, setup that sh. And now it's installing. So we could have easily installed this with apt dash kit, which, if you look, look what it's doing, it's actually rolling through the packages here. And it's updating the repositories, right these packages, and then it's going to go ahead and download what it needs. So it's running apt get anyway, if you see updating apt, it's installing the dependencies. So the easier way, the quick way, which he suggested was to do it through there, and it's right, they don't always have the installed packages in apt get. So that's why I wanted to show you the GitHub version of it. So you can go ahead and let this install. Let's just go ahead and recap quickly what we just did. So we used, we used apt get update, and upgrade to install updates in our system. We used git clone, to be able to download packages and clone packages off of GitHub. And we used apt get to be able to download Git itself. So that's really it for this lesson, what I do encourage you to do is go through the man pages of get and go through the man pages of apt get, because you're also able to remove programs, update specific programs, etc. So this lesson really just wanted to introduce you to the basics of downloading updating for your system. I encourage you to learn how to remove files, as well as a little bit of homework for yourself. So thank you for joining me, and I'll catch you over in the next lesson. All right, welcome to the last lesson video. So in this video, we are going to be scripting with bash. Now this may seem a little overwhelming at first, what we're going to be doing is building out a ping sweeper script, it's going to be pretty basic. And what I want you to do is maybe just watch this video once, and then the second time through, really try to follow along with it, take notes, etc, I think of first time watch through you know, just to get the concepts, understand what I'm doing. And then the second time really, really get hands on with it. And I think that will be probably the best way to learn. But if you have a different learning style, please do go ahead and try that as well. The only thing I could say is don't let this intimidate you. Hopefully by the time the video is over with you will have a pretty good understanding on basic scripting and how scripting can really be beneficial and improve our timing, improve automation, etc. So let's go ahead and quickly talk about some of the things we're gonna be learning in this video. Okay, so some of the commands and items we're going to learn, we're going to talk about grep, which is going to allow us to narrow down some results. We're also going to talk about cut and T are both of those are also going to help us narrow down some results. So basically, we're going to start with a ping, that we're going to send out and we're going to want to gather information back that says that ping was valid. So we want to know any computer that responded to us. Well, how are we going to do that? Well, we need to identify what a valid ping looks like, we're going to use grep to to kind of narrow down a string or a sentence or something that identifies with a positive Ping. And then we're going to cut out everything we don't want and use tr as well to cut some things out that we don't want. So we're going to put this into a script when it's all said and done. And we're also going to be talking about the usage of for loops and their importance, not only with using them in this script, but how we can use simple one liners to do everyday things for us. So I'll show you at the end of the video how we're going to use like n map and use a for loop with n map to run through and map scripts. So stay tuned through the video. Again, if you are a hands on learner, maybe first time through you you try hands on but my recommendation here is to just sit back, watch the video understand what's going on. Second time really follow along with it, take notes and get the most that you can know this lesson. So let's go ahead and get started. Alright, so now we're going to be covering bash scripting. So the first thing we're gonna need to cover before we get into writing our scripts is how to narrow down results. And we say narrowing down results. What we're saying is for given a block of text, and we want to extract some information from that block of text, how are we going to do that? So that's what we're going to cover in this lesson. Okay, so let's go ahead and get started. What we're going to be doing today is narrowing down a ping result. So if we come into here, and we need to ping an IP address within our system, so I'm going to be pinging 192 dot 168, dot one dot 90. And you're going to see that it returns a 64 bytes from that address. So it looks like we're getting a response. I'm going to hit Ctrl C here. So if you remember from the networking section, we actually get a response unlimited until we cancel it, right, like we just Ctrl C here from Ping. So there's another thing that we can do, if we only want to send one packet and see if it's alive or not, we can do a dash c of one. So we're just going to do that. So that's a count of one, we're sending one packet over, if we set 10, it would send 10 packets over if that makes sense. So now what we're going to do is we're going to put this into a txt file. So if you remember from previous video, we just use this little carrot here. And I'm going to call this IP dot txt. Okay, and if we cat IP dot txt, you'll see the same results there. So now what we're going to want to do is we're going to want to narrow this down. What do I want to extract from here? Well, I want to extract this IP address. And it'll make more sense when we get into the scripting part. But what we're going to do is we're going to get out, specifically of this, this IP address from this line. Now, all we're interested in actually is a returned IP address that has a valid response, right? So if I were to tack, or if I were to enter in here, save 15 dot 90. Okay, there's no response there. So this is kind of what it looks like. When it doesn't get a response back, it just kind of lingers. And then we hit Ctrl C, and it says, zero ping statistics, right, nothing was was received back. So what we see when we get a response back, as we see 64 bytes, when there's no response back, we don't have any bytes. So if we're doing a sweep through a network, which we're going to be doing later, we need to be able to narrow down these results. So if we're sending say 190 2.168 dot 1.1, all the way through to 55. And we want to see who responds back and then take that list and narrow it down to the IP addresses, which exactly what we're going to be doing, we need to know how to narrow that down. So we're going to be narrowing down on specifically is 64 bytes. So let's tab up a couple times to this cat IP address. And we're going to do a pipe and the pipe just means we're going to add an additional command here. So the additional command we're going to do is called grep. grep is going to grab any line with what you specify. So let's specify 64 bytes and see what happens. See, now if you notice, we had all of these lines before. And now a grep is doing is grep is taking only the lines that contain 64 bytes. So again, a valid response. So we have 64 bytes here. And we have achieved a response. So what we're going to do now is we're going to narrow this down some more. Okay, we've got this line here. But again, we're still trying to extract this IP address. So how can we do that? Well, there is a tool called cut. So if we tap up again, we do another pipe because they're sending a new command. We're gonna say cut and cut syntax looks like this. And I'll explain it once I type it out here. Okay, so we have cut, and then this hyphen D, that's a delimiter. So the delimiter is what we're going to be cutting on. So we're giving a delimiter of a space, meaning here's a space, here's a space, here's a space, so we're going to be cutting on these spaces. And then we give a field, we say okay, what field we want to retrieve back from this cut. Okay, we want field four, if you look 1234 and the fourth field is our IP address. So it's going to say okay, I'm going to cut on this space, I'm going to cut on this space, I'm going to cut on this space, and then I'm gonna take it right here. Now if we identified field five, we will be taking this if we identified field three we'd be taking from so let's go ahead and just hit enter and see what that looks like. Okay, so now we are narrowed down even more. But there's an issue here, if we were to try to send this IP address, we would have this little colon here attached on to it, and you can't ping with that IP address. So we're going to be doing a sweep or narrowing down this list, then we're going to actually need to remove this guy here. So let's take a look at how we do that. So if we tab up again, and again, we're going to add a pipe. Now we're going to use a command called tr. And tr just means translate, what we're going to be doing is another delimiter. So dash D there, and we're going to be taking out that colon. So it should look something like this. If we hit enter, now you can see that that colon has been removed. Okay, now let's talk about how we can use this information to write out a script, we're going to start with a basic script, and we can add upon it as we go. So I've gone ahead and written out a script, but we're going to talk about it very slowly, so you can actually look at it and copy it down. So what we're going to do is go ahead and say g edit, and I call this IP sweep.sh. So go ahead and do the same or something similar, and hit enter. So let's take a look at this script. So at the very top here, we have to declare what we're doing. So we're going to give a hash bang. And we do this with any scripting language. So if was a Python, we'd be entering Python here, but this is bash. So we're going to be doing a forward slash bin forward slash bash that declares that we're running a bash script. And the.sh also indicates that we're running a bash script. So I want you to ignore this line here in this line here. For now, let's talk about this line. This should look very, very familiar. So we're doing in this line, we're saying we're going to ping with a count of one, which we talked about. And then we're going to do something here, we've got $1, sign one and $1 sign IP, let's just ignore that for now. Okay, so we're going to go ahead and do the rest that should look familiar, we're going to say we're going to grab 64 bytes, we're going to cut the delimiter of a space field before, and then we're going to do a translate, right and take off that little bit at the end. Okay, I added an ampersand here at the end. So an ampersand allows us to do threading. So that's exactly why it's in there. If we didn't, we'd have to let the process go one IP at a time. And we'll talk about that in a second as well. So let's talk about this four line. So a for loop is what we're actually running here. And the loop is saying, I want to do an IP address, we're just declaring a variable here, you can call it whatever you want. Or we're saying, hey, for this IP in a sequence of one through 254, we're going to do something and that do is a pain. So what this means is for IP, and if we think about it in sequence one through 254, what it's saying is 1234, all the way up to 254. Okay, so think about it this way, if we say for one, in this ping sweep, we're gonna do that, right, so we're gonna say 414243, all the way through to 34. That's what this loop is doing. So it's a very, very simple loop. Now, IP is replaced down here, at the very end. Now, we're also calling out this dollar sign one. Now this dollar sign one is user input. So we're going to actually do something this is called IP sweep, right. So we're gonna have to call out this IP sweep something like this.sh. And then we're going to have to give out some information, it's going to request information, if we don't provide it, it won't know how to ping. So we're going to do is we're going to say the first three octets of our home network. So if yours is 190 2.16 8.1, like mine is, then you just enter 192 dot 168 dot one. Now, we could also for simplicity, just hard code this. So we can say 192 dot 168 dot one.ip address, and it will be fine. We don't have to build this in the only reason we're not hard coding it is because you can do multiple pin sleeves. This can be a ping sweep script for you in the future if you're on a different network, or you just want to write something out really quick. dollar sign one works perfect. But if you want to leave it hard coded like this, it'll also work. So let's go ahead and just delete this out. I'm going to put this into dollar sign one again to have a proof of concept. And then we are going to run this. So all we do here at the end is declared done. If we didn't run this with an ampersand here, we would have to add a semi colon similar to this. But because we are having an ampersand we can actually get rid of that and just put that back just for some syntax. Clarity here. Okay, so let's go ahead and save this. And remember from our lesson, we're going to have to change the mode of our script because it's not executable by default. So we're going to do a plus x here. And then we're going to call our IP sweep that sh, we can LS and make sure it's green. Here's ip c.sh. And then we'll do a dot forward slash ip sweeped a sh, and I'm not going to enter anything in as want to show proof of concept. So see a ran through every single number here and threading, and nameless service not known because we didn't provide an IP address. So what we can do here is we need to provide that IP address 168 dot one, hit enter. Okay, and it pulls back some information. So what we can do with this information, let's write this out to a file. So let's just call this IP list dot txt, something like this. Okay, it's done. Now, let's just cat out the IP list dot txt. Okay, now we have an IP list of the IPS in our network that we just swept, right. And we can use this information later on. But before we go into that, I do want to go back and just improve our script a very, very tiny bit. So let's go ahead and just tab up a couple times. So we get to our G edit. And let me show you how we can improve this script, it doesn't have to be overly complicated, what we can do is, we can say something like this, we can come in here and give an if statement. So an IF is conditional, right? We're gonna say, if this exists, then do something. And if it doesn't exist, do something else. So we're gonna say if dollar sign one is equal to nothing, is going to give blank space here. And then we're going to say, then we want to do something. So what are we going to do, we can echo out something similar to you forgot an IP address. And then echo out what you need to do. Like syntax. dot slash ping sweep, or IP sweep is what we call this IP sweep that sh, and then IP. Or we can even write it out an example, right? Like something like that. So that way, our user, if they're using it, we wrote this for somebody else, they know what we're talking about. And at the very end, we just need to write if backwards, we'll put it ephi. So what this is saying is, if this is not then echo here, right, we're going to echo these, and then we need to add one other thing here, which is an else, let's go ahead and hit enter, just to space this out a little bit. So if we have no dollar sign one declared, right, if we have nothing entered in, we're gonna say echo, you forgot an IP address and syntax here. If we do have something in dollar sign one, okay, we're going to do something else, we're going to do our ping sweep. And that's it. So this is very similar and modified from Georgia Weidman that I've got a long time ago. So full credit goes to her for this little script, it was very, very easy to learn. And it's also very easy to teach. So let's go ahead and just run this one more time, we're going to say IP sweep the SH. And look what happens now it says you forgot an IP address. Now we can declare a number in there anything in the scripts not perfect, right, we were expecting three octets. And we could give it a one. And it's still going to do something like that, which is incorrect, right? So we need to be able to, to modify this down more, but that gets really advanced scripting into declaring that needs to be three octets. And if you don't provide those, then what, and that just gets more advanced. So we really just need to know, hey, what we're doing here, very basic script for ourselves, and something to remember. Okay, so let's clear our screen. Last thing I want to show you. So we've been able to write a script out. But we can also do looping in one line. And this is where it becomes kind of fun. So we have this IP list, right? We did cat IP list dot Tex. Now let's say we've got this IP list together, and we want to do an N map scan on all of these IPS. Now we could just say and map and type in the syntax you want and the IP address of it. For every single one of these start a new tab and let that happen. Or you could do something in a for loop. So we can write the same for loop that we did before. We're going to say for IP, and then we're going to do is we're going to write $1 sign and we're going to cat the IP List dot txt. So all it does is is bringing out this list that we have here and it's saying, okay, for this IP, this IP, this IP, etc we're gonna run through all of these. That's what the loop does, right? Okay, we're gonna do our semi colon, and then we're going to tell it to do something, right. So what do we want to do? Okay, let's run a mF script. So we're going to say do and map. And we'll ping, or we'll do a port, Port 80 on all these, and we'll say, still scan that on port 80. And we'll do t four for a speed. And that should be yet. So then we can do done like this and let it run through one at a time. We can also do the ampersand and let it run multiples like this, we can hit enter and see what that does. But I also forgot one thing here, forgot to declare the IP address. So let's talk about it real quick. So we've got a very, very simple one liner, and you're gonna see one liners a lot if you get into ethical hacking, and just allows us to do things quickly and scripted. So we got four IP address in this list. So every IP in this list, we're going to loop through, when we do that loop, we're going to do an map, we're gonna do a quick stealth scan of Port 80 t four, and we're gonna say declare the IP address. If you're not comfortable with M map, that's okay, this is purely an example. And something you will see in your career. I will make a scripting video at some point for n map. And we'll cover mF more in detail. So let's go ahead and just hit enter. Okay, I messed up my syntax. So what's going on? Okay, so for IP in, this got deleted for IP and cat IP list. Let's try this one more time. Okay, so we just did all these scans seven scans at once. And what we did is, you see, these are the processes that are starting. So it started up eight processes, actually not seven. And it's just running through this list doing the scans. And we're going to go ahead and just kind of look at it. So it says, okay, on one dot 74 is at open, it's open, okay. And then on 254 is at open, it's open. And then you see filter down here, or it's not running, filtered, filtered, same thing. So we can hit Ctrl C, or hit enter for done. And that's pretty much it. So what we just did is we ran a map scans at one time instead of having to copy and paste these. So that's just a little bit of what scripting can do. It does get more advanced. But to be able to know a one line for loop is a really, really important if you go into penetration testing. And it's just important in basic bash scripting as well. So that's really it for this lesson. And that's really it for this course.

If you haven't, please do like the video, word of mouth is the best thing for me, it helps me grow my channel and helps me give content back to you as I get more feedback. And I grow as a channel. So I'm looking to do more courses in the future. And appreciate you taking time with me. If you like this course and you want to chat with me check the descriptions down below, I've got a discord channel, we've got quite a few people in there. And I've also got a Twitter if you want to hit me up there. Lastly, I do have a Patreon. If you felt like this course is valuable, and you'd like to support me, any dollar amount goes a long way for me recording equipment, recording software, all that's very expensive. And the time spent on this is also very detailed long hours. So if you want to support me or, or anything a like, subscribe, etc, it goes a long way. I appreciate you taking the time to watch this course. And until the next one, thank you so much for joining me. All right, and now some bonus material. So I'm adding in some additional resources. These are for those of you that want to continue on, you've learned Linux now and you're like, Hey, I really want to be a pen tester. I think this is for me, I'm gonna provide you a whole lot of different resources here. So take notes, these are some of the best resources I could think of for those wanting to get into the field. I'll briefly cover each of them and then leave you added to do your own research and hopefully, see you in the field someday as a pen tester. So let's take a look at some of these resources. Okay, so first resource is a shameless self promotion. And I only do this because I do think that I'm a valuable resource. I'm trying not to be biased here but I've got some good, good stuff that's completely free if you're interested in it. So if you come to youtube.com slash c slash the cyber mentor, you can come to my page here and you can check out all the videos I have. One video is a day in the life Have an ethical hacker. So if you want to know what it's like to be an ethical hacker, if you're still not sure if this is the field for you, this might be a video for you to view talks about the day in and day out stuff that you might do, what kind of assessment work you might be asked to do and what it's really like to be a, an ethical hacker. On top of that, I've got another video on cyber career paths about penetration testing and ethical hacking. So if you're looking to get into the field, and you want to become a pen tester, or ethical hacker, and you're not quite sure where to go, this is probably the better video for you, it kind of talks about all the knowledge that you'll need for a junior perspective, and really the knowledge that you'll need to be successful in the field, including certifications, etc. So if you're watching this video as an additional resource, this will probably be additional resource. Part two is a good way to call it this is the one like really detailed on penetration testing and ethical hacking. On top of that, over here, I've got playlists. So if you come into the playlist, I've got a few courses, most importantly, is our zero to hero course. So if we come to the cyber mentor.com, and you go to courses over here, and you go to zero to hero pentesting You can find more information on the syllabus. So I put it into lesson plan as well here, but there are let's see 11 episodes, we start with Linux kind of like you've already learned, no keeping some introduction, we do Python for two weeks, we do information gathering Oh send recon scanning, enumeration exploitation, we do internal attacks as well. So we'll build out an Active Directory lab. And we'll learn how to do these internal attacks aren't really taught in a lot of courses. And then we'll end it with some file transfers, maintaining access, etc report writing as well and career advice. So this is like my complete course, it's called zero to hero to take somebody from from a complete zero and bring them into hero where they can start doing some pentesting on their own. So again, if you're interested in that course, you can come to my website and check it out with lessons plan, you can just click in the tab and play the video or on my YouTube channel, you can click right on the playlist and play it from there as well. So leaving the shameless self promotion, let me talk about some more cheap alternatives. hack the box is a great, great alternative if you're just getting started. So for hack the box, what it is, is it's a series of vulnerable machines. So you could think of it almost like a game. So if you want to do some hacking, this is a great place to just start practicing and learning the ropes. What we can do is like say we could pick something on the easy side, you want to look for something like that's more green right on the left, because that shows easy, you would pick a box like this, you would scan against it. And you know, if you don't know what I'm talking about, that's fine, but you would scan against it and try to find vulnerabilities and hack it. So really, really great website, if you have the VIP, they're starting to move it, it's in beta right now. But they have 20 boxes that you can attack on active side and 20 in the VIP. But the nice thing about the VIP is they're about to open up all 97 that had been retired. So they retire one every week and they bring a new one in. So you gain access. It's like $13 a month, this is free, completely free platform if you don't want it but this is 13 bucks a month for the VIP access. And you can come in here and do some of these machines that are super duper easy. And if you click into them, they'll have write ups for them. And they'll also have video walkthroughs for a lot of these machines. So that's a really, really great stuff, right? If you have no idea what you're doing, this is a great place to start. Because these retired boxes are boxes that have already been done, you can watch how somebody else did them, you can learn their methodology. And this is really good for just getting the basics down and understanding you know, some basic hacking. Same thing here with the virtual hacking labs, it's very similar. They've got a labs, they've got a course and they got different pricing. So you can try these out if you're interested in them. So they are, you know, just alternatives to just practice online. Then you've got bowling hub as well, you'll have to search through this and try to find something that's like beginner level or Google online, which which are realistic boxes, or what are good boxes on volm. hub of Ohio, basically you just download the VMware file, and you play it on VMware and you try to attack the the machine so you download a machine, you try to attack it. And these are intentionally vulnerable machines, all these right here on these top three. So let's say that that's not really where you want to start, you think maybe you could use a little bit more hand holding and you like a certification to come behind it. I'm going to show you the top three in my order that I think for pentesting at least at a beginner to mid tier level, what the top three are. So either insecurity gets number one slot in my mind, if you come into here and you go on to certifications. So they've got a couple different ones, the ECP PT, or actually, let's go to courses. So the penetration testing student and the penetration testing professional, the student is for the beginner, the professionals a little bit more advanced leaves off for the beginner ends. So if we come in the student, you can see some of the things that you'll learn. So they've got, you know, it talks about the preliminary skills that you might need and teaches you those, it's got some programming, and then just the basics of penetration testing, but it gives you an idea what it's like. On top of that the ISP PTP course they have is like more in depth more advanced, you start getting into assembly language and buffer overflows, you get into network pentesting, some PowerShell, Linux web app, Wi Fi, some Ruby for medispa light. So I think this is a really well rounded really up to date. The downside of this course is that it's not, it's not really well known on the HR side of things so and then the pricing can get a little expensive. On the elite side, right now it's 16 $100. The cheapest is the 1200, I would at least get the middle tier. But as of right now they're offering that PTs and the PTP, if you buy the PTP, they give you the PTS for free, but that won't be going on much longer. But you can always hold out for deals like this as well. Another resource and a very, very well known resource, probably the best certification in terms of being known is the O SCP. So it starts out at 800 bucks, as you can see here, you're probably going to spend more money than that, because that's just 30 days. So the nice thing about this is it comes with labs, there's a certain amount of machines in there that you can try to hack against, sort of like a hack the box, but it's an environment. So you can you notice, attack whatever you feel like and try to navigate your way through the network. And then when you are done, and you want to test for the certification, you have to actually hack in an environment of the set number of machines you have to hack against. And you have to be successful in hacking those machines to get your certification. So it's considered one of the more difficult certifications out there to achieve. And you'll see it come up a lot of times in HR or job applications that they want this oscp. So this is something to look into and consider as well. The cost isn't as bad as the elearn. But the con here is that office of security courses haven't been updated in five or so years. So you really need to, you know, it's kind of the best of both worlds if you were able to do both. But this one will get you into more doors, this one will get you a little bit more current. But there are plenty of resources out there, all these tabs are showing you that you don't have to spend a ton of money to get this stuff. These are more things that if you want that certification, you want that that coursework, that knowledge, these are great resources, all three of these. So last is the G Pen. Now the G Pen is just an exam. By itself, it's 17 $100. It is by sans right. So this is showing g i see you actually have to take the corresponding sans course that goes with it. And that course is upwards of $6,000. So unless you can get a employer to pay for this sans certification, probably not the best. But the thing that I like about sans is that it stays up to date, they are constantly updating their courses, and that they look good on a resume. It's one of those really high tier high level certifications. And the exam from what I hear is actually pretty good. It's not a practical exam, but it's a fairly good exam. And the nice thing I didn't mention elearn security is also a practical so this oscp is practical, the elearn security exams practical, you have to hack your way through to to pass and write a report as well. This one is a multiple choice exam, I do believe. So these are three certifications that you can look into if you wanting to go down that route. I would start with the PTS if you can, it's dirt cheap. You know, if I have to make a recommendation just to make sure that you're you're really interested in this, if you know for sure. And you want to do that pts PTP combo, this might be a good choice here. But other than that, I mean, the free resources like I've got my channel, there's ton of videos, the zero to hero course is like at least 20 to 30 hours of material. hack the box you'll spend a lot of time on there's plenty of write ups if you just Google like, honestly, if we go into here and we say like apocalypse here. If you say that and you Google that with right up, you're going to find the right up for this or you'll find a video for this or some kind of walkthrough, right. So you just want to look through these and try to try it on your own and then go back And then watch the write up and see how you could have improved if you'd got through it. Or where you can improve an enumeration or whatever it is you need to, to get better to actually succeed the next time you try attacking these machines. So that is it. You have reached the end of this course and the end of the bonus material. If you need anything, I provided my contact info again in the beginning. You know, I'm at the cyber mentor on Twitter, you can reach me on YouTube as well. And I really do. Thank you for joining me I look forward to seeing many of you take the next step from this Linux, if you made it this far, you've already gotten through the beginner Linux. That's awesome. I hope you take this next step and that you are intrigued by penetration testing because we need more people in the field. So I look forward to seeing you guys and girls come through and hopefully I'll work with some of you someday. So until next time, my name is Heath Adams and I thank you for joining me
