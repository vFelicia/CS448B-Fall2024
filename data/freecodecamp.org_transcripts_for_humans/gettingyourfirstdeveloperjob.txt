00:00 - hi everyone my name is christine and i'm
00:05 - a front-end web developer
00:07 - i actually just started programming six
00:10 - months ago and i found my first
00:13 - dev job about three months so now i've
00:15 - been a web developer for about
00:17 - three to four months now and i really
00:20 - love it
00:21 - so
00:22 - this talk i'm just gonna give a little
00:24 - background
00:25 - about myself and my interest in coding
00:29 - and also
00:30 - how what i did to
00:32 - land my first
00:33 - job
00:36 - so i graduated from the university of
00:39 - oklahoma about four years ago with the
00:42 - political science degree and i didn't
00:44 - really know what exactly to do with a
00:46 - political science degree i was confused
00:49 - and lost
00:50 - and
00:51 - so
00:51 - i decided that
00:53 - i wanted to be a lawyer or
00:56 - be a makeup artist be other different
00:58 - things i had so many different hobbies
01:00 - that i wanted to do
01:02 - and i contemplated thought about it and
01:04 - i realized that those are the type of
01:06 - jobs that i might not be interested in
01:08 - the long run
01:10 - and so i got into
01:12 - coding when i landed my first job in the
01:15 - marketing
01:17 - field and i worked with html templates
01:20 - in wysiwyg and a lot of the stuff that i
01:22 - did before was mainly just
01:26 - coding uh the tables inside the wysiwyg
01:29 - very simple stuff
01:31 - and
01:32 - i realized that i wanted to do more in
01:33 - life i didn't want to stay at my old job
01:36 - because
01:37 - you know i just feel like i would
01:38 - plateau quickly
01:40 - so i looked around for different types
01:43 - of classes i looked into getting a
01:45 - computer science degree but i realized
01:48 - that you don't really need a computer
01:49 - science degree to do web development
01:52 - and i really like web development
01:53 - because i like art and design so i feel
01:56 - like that would be something i'm good at
02:00 - so i looked around online for some
02:02 - classes
02:04 - and a lot of the classes were really
02:05 - expensive one class to learn javascript
02:07 - was about two grand that i saw
02:10 - and so i was like you know i feel like i
02:12 - could find something else you know maybe
02:14 - try different routes some other classes
02:16 - that may be cheaper
02:18 - and then i saw ok coders which is where
02:20 - i met carson he was one of my
02:23 - instructors at ok coders and had helped
02:25 - me a lot throughout my journey so i just
02:28 - want to say thank you carson very very
02:29 - much
02:31 - but uh so i found ok coders and it's
02:34 - basically a six month
02:37 - module or six modules six months long
02:40 - bootcamp class every saturday
02:42 - and you learn everything about web
02:44 - development starting with beginning with
02:46 - html css
02:47 - you learn how to use your command line
02:50 - you learn how to use your github where
02:52 - you push all your files
02:54 - and
02:55 - into github and then also
02:57 - javascript libraries which is really
02:59 - really important if you're looking to be
03:02 - a front-end developer
03:05 - so yeah
03:06 - i attended bootcamp for about six months
03:09 - and a lot of the work i had to code i
03:12 - have to practice coding every single day
03:15 - and get better
03:16 - the classes were only four hours long
03:19 - every week and i knew
03:20 - that you have to put
03:23 - extra work
03:24 - into
03:25 - um
03:26 - you have to put in the extra work
03:28 - outside of class
03:30 - so
03:31 - you know i studied a lot i
03:34 - read all my documentation that's
03:36 - probably the most important thing is
03:38 - reading your documentation starting out
03:41 - and that's what i did i use all my
03:43 - online resources i practice on
03:45 - codeacademy udemy
03:48 - lynda.com those are great if you want to
03:50 - get into coding those are great online
03:53 - resources to take and practice on
03:57 - i also asked a lot of help from people i
04:00 - joined teclahoma met a lot of the great
04:02 - developers in the community
04:04 - and just getting advice from people or
04:07 - people who have experience in this type
04:09 - of career really helped me
04:12 - love being a developer even more
04:14 - the excitement of
04:16 - you know seeing people creating
04:18 - so many cool
04:20 - uh things
04:22 - it's just sorry i got nervous but
04:24 - creating a lot of cool things is just
04:26 - amazing and and i think that's why we
04:28 - all want to be developers is that we
04:30 - want to create something and build
04:31 - something of our own
04:33 - and so um anyways i practice a lot and
04:37 - then i was also looking for a job at the
04:39 - same time knowing that i'm probably not
04:41 - qualified
04:43 - but i gave it a shot anyways i just kept
04:45 - trying and
04:47 - i attended job fairs
04:49 - and brushed up my resume
04:52 - i created a portfolio
04:54 - i created a lot of side projects and
04:56 - pushed everything to my github to show
04:59 - that i put in a lot of work
05:01 - even if i know my code wasn't that great
05:03 - i just
05:04 - pushed everything
05:06 - into my github and then
05:09 - finally got my first dev job
05:12 - at a marketing company who's willing to
05:14 - take this opportunity
05:16 - opportunity on me even though they know
05:18 - that i'm probably i'm still really new
05:20 - and not
05:22 - fully qualified um i got the job and
05:26 - i was really excited
05:29 - got a little
05:30 - content and about two weeks ago i
05:33 - actually almost lost my job
05:36 - because i wasn't practicing
05:38 - enough outside of work and that's the
05:41 - most important things that i want to
05:42 - tell you guys starting out as a
05:44 - developer if you have not much or no
05:46 - prior program experience you have to
05:50 - practice even when you get the job you
05:52 - have to practice outside work
05:54 - and i just i got to continue i was too
05:57 - happy and i relaxed and then
06:00 - you know i was in a very tough spot
06:03 - where they said that i need to improve
06:05 - or it just won't work out
06:08 - and i was given two weeks to show
06:11 - improvement at my job
06:13 - and i did it
06:14 - and
06:18 - it was
06:19 - very
06:20 - it was a lot of work um i just whatever
06:23 - i did at work i showed them and i had
06:27 - better communication with my senior
06:29 - developers that's also one important
06:32 - thing that you guys have to know is
06:33 - communication with your fellow
06:35 - developers
06:36 - that was one thing that i didn't do very
06:38 - well i i was the type of person that i
06:41 - wanted to learn everything my front-end
06:43 - skills weren't even that great and i
06:45 - wanted to learn to do php and sql and
06:47 - all the backend
06:49 - and i took in work that i don't even
06:52 - know what i was coding they gave me php
06:55 - and sql and i'm just sitting here trying
06:56 - to figure it out when i realized that
06:59 - sometimes you have to say no when you're
07:01 - not ready for something you have to say
07:03 - no
07:04 - and so i was honest to them and said hey
07:06 - i'm i'm not ready for this yet
07:08 - and i need to practice on my front-end
07:10 - skills and that's what i did
07:13 - so
07:14 - when you get your new job when you get
07:15 - your developer job make sure you are
07:18 - fluent with all your languages before
07:20 - jumping into something else
07:22 - for me i just
07:24 - i just wanted to learn everything i
07:26 - couldn't say no because
07:28 - i was scared to say no i wanted
07:30 - i wanted to learn everything and be good
07:32 - at everything and sometimes you know
07:36 - it's you have to take it one step at a
07:38 - time i thought being a developer means
07:40 - you have to know you know react you have
07:42 - to know angular even though at my job we
07:45 - use jquery like i wanted to learn react
07:48 - and angular i want to do all these
07:49 - things but i know i have to take it one
07:52 - step at a time and that's the important
07:54 - thing
07:55 - another thing is besides that
07:59 - is getting feedback from your senior
08:02 - devs and
08:03 - you know just your fellow developers
08:05 - that you're working with especially when
08:06 - you're new getting feedback is great
08:08 - knowing your work process like how
08:11 - you're doing always ask them like how am
08:13 - i doing do you think i'm doing okay
08:15 - because i know everyone has their own
08:17 - different techniques
08:18 - so it's best to just have a good
08:20 - communication and getting feedback
08:23 - from your peers
08:25 - and another one is never stop practicing
08:29 - always keep learning i'm still in the
08:31 - learning process right now i mean a
08:33 - couple weeks ago i
08:36 - was here trying to debug a bootstrap
08:38 - carousel and i felt embarrassed
08:41 - debugging a bootstrap carousel because
08:43 - i'm like well this is so simple like why
08:46 - can't i get it but i learned that it's
08:48 - still a learning process for me i'm
08:50 - still i'm still learning i'm still
08:52 - continuing to grow and sometimes it's
08:54 - okay to ask for help even something so
08:57 - simple like bootstrap carousel or
08:59 - learning how to use bootstrap it's
09:01 - never embarrassing to ask questions
09:03 - because you actually learn from asking
09:05 - questions just don't ask the same
09:07 - questions over and over ask and absorb
09:09 - that's the most important thing
09:12 - but yeah and then another thing is oh
09:15 - yeah this is probably important too but
09:17 - try to use the same ides as your fellow
09:20 - developers i know we all have
09:22 - you know a preference that we use like i
09:24 - like visual studio code um that's just
09:27 - my preference but i know like at my job
09:29 - and stuff we use php storm or like adam
09:33 - and stuff like that i just think it's
09:35 - you don't you don't have to do it but i
09:38 - think it helps with the workflow and the
09:39 - process when you use the same ide as
09:41 - your fellow peers
09:43 - that usually helps a lot
09:46 - and then another tip is
09:49 - when you get your first project it's
09:51 - always good to whiteboard it out draw a
09:54 - map of how you're going to build your
09:56 - website you know have an idea before you
09:59 - actually start coding
10:01 - that was my mistake too is i didn't
10:03 - really have an idea
10:04 - and so i kind of just start coding
10:06 - random things when you have to wipe word
10:08 - it out you have to talk to your boss
10:10 - don't try to take initiative with
10:12 - anything
10:13 - not well don't try to take initiative
10:15 - with everything
10:17 - beside and not letting your fellow
10:19 - developers know always always try to
10:22 - wipe board it out
10:24 - and then another thing is um biddle law
10:27 - side projects
10:29 - if you have anything you're interested
10:30 - in building do it after work hours you
10:33 - know take the weekend off don't go out
10:35 - with your friends like if you have to
10:38 - improve you have to just start
10:40 - practicing more and more build something
10:41 - cool like i want to eventually build an
10:43 - app but i don't know what happened yet
10:45 - but
10:46 - um another thing is don't be afraid to
10:49 - try new things um code something
10:51 - different don't code the same thing over
10:53 - and over
10:54 - right now since i'm still pretty new i
10:56 - am practicing on building my jquery maps
11:00 - i built a couple maps before
11:02 - and
11:03 - but i'm still practicing i'm
11:05 - not that great with the map i'm learning
11:07 - how to style maps with javascript so
11:10 - build something new try something new at
11:12 - least every single week and you'll get
11:14 - better and just learn that way
11:19 - let's see what else
11:35 - okay but yeah it's um so that's
11:39 - all i really have with the tips and
11:42 - advice
11:43 - and my story is just really practicing
11:46 - using your online resources
11:49 - talk to your peers
11:50 - also have good communication with your
11:52 - boss
11:54 - when finding a job push yourself out
11:56 - there join organizations that's what i
11:59 - did you know i joined teclahoma i joined
12:01 - free code camp i talked with my
12:03 - instructors that's the most important
12:05 - thing it's just communicating with
12:07 - fellow developers
12:08 - that could give you really good advice
12:10 - and also
12:11 - don't take criticism
12:13 - as an insult always take criticism as
12:16 - something you can prove and learn from
12:18 - and that's
12:20 - the most important thing is um
12:22 - and then
12:24 - yeah getting
12:25 - feedback positive side projects
12:29 - draw a map
12:32 - yeah that's
12:34 - really all that i have i know it's kind
12:36 - of short but if anyone has any questions
12:40 - or yeah
12:43 - well my interview was actually very
12:46 - short
12:47 - i didn't really take a test or anything
12:48 - i know some companies require you to
12:50 - take a test i actually
12:52 - took a test a couple weeks before that
12:55 - with an hr recruiter when i was trying
12:56 - to find a job
12:58 - just testing my javascript
13:00 - and i did alright on that but they
13:02 - didn't hire me on
13:04 - another company
13:06 - saw that i was very motivated to learn
13:09 - and try new things and also they liked
13:12 - the fact that at my previous job i wore
13:14 - many hats like i did all the digital
13:16 - content at my job and
13:19 - i was lucky enough because the company i
13:20 - work for really needed someone
13:23 - and so i got the job as a web developer
13:29 - yeah
13:30 - and that's
13:31 - i just told them my experience and
13:33 - everything gave him my portfolio
13:36 - and then yeah
13:37 - from there
13:45 - the most useful thing that i did was
13:47 - mainly
13:49 - reading my documentation
13:51 - in the beginning
13:53 - i can't i can't say this enough but
13:56 - reading your documentation is so so
13:58 - important that's what i spent my time
14:00 - doing
14:02 - outside of work now is just reading
14:04 - through everything carefully and even
14:07 - though i was in boot camp class i missed
14:08 - like the little things here and there
14:10 - because i was trying to
14:12 - code out my portfolio but even when i
14:15 - coded out it still wasn't it wasn't good
14:17 - i did a lot of
14:19 - what i did
14:20 - was i would always inspect right click
14:23 - inspect in my console and then just go
14:25 - in there in a debug but when you
14:26 - actually read your documentation clearly
14:29 - and thoroughly it really helps you to
14:31 - understand
14:32 - what you're doing a lot more so i can
14:34 - just code it out now fluently rather
14:36 - than having to inspect all the time
14:39 - and so i did that and then
14:41 - just practice a lot online outside of
14:44 - work
14:45 - that was probably the most useful things
14:46 - that i did as a developer
14:51 - yes
15:04 - well it's like so like on bootstrap
15:06 - saying
15:07 - you know it gives you all the elements
15:08 - and stuff so they have um your columns
15:11 - how to build bootstrap columns um how to
15:14 - do responsive media queries and stuff
15:17 - like that when you really read it
15:18 - through it helps you understand how to
15:20 - build
15:22 - your columns on your web page when i
15:24 - started out i didn't know that
15:26 - in every div container there are 12
15:29 - columns
15:30 - and
15:31 - reading that part made me understand
15:34 - that now instead of having to inspect my
15:35 - element every time i know that if i were
15:38 - to build two comps it's just
15:40 - automatically column md6 column md6
15:43 - and so forth so it's like reading your
15:45 - documentation really helps you
15:47 - understand that and also
15:49 - once you get your html css and
15:52 - those skills down it'll help you
15:54 - understand javascript more because
15:56 - you'll learn how to use dom elements and
15:58 - that's the key thing
16:00 - so yeah really read your documentation
16:03 - man
16:06 - anybody else
16:13 - yeah well now eight months
16:15 - because i've been in my job for about
16:17 - three and a half months now
16:19 - but i got actually got my first job at
16:22 - my last module
16:24 - coders bootcamp class so
16:26 - yeah
16:28 - yes
16:35 - you just have to show
16:38 - oh
16:42 - i'm sorry sorry can you say it
16:45 - oh okay
16:46 - sorry
16:54 - okay so he said that when you're a new
16:57 - developer what does your company expect
17:00 - out of you when you first started versus
17:03 - three months in
17:04 - so when you first started they want you
17:06 - to get to get familiar with their
17:09 - process of working
17:11 - and also how they you know just really
17:14 - focus on their software um i'm not sure
17:16 - how other jobs are but i know my company
17:19 - we use a software where we import all
17:22 - our code codes in and the software was
17:24 - built by our
17:26 - lead senior developer
17:28 - and so that's the main thing is when you
17:30 - first started out is learning how to use
17:32 - the software where to place your header
17:34 - code where to place the footer where do
17:36 - you place your link tags and everything
17:38 - in that where do you place your
17:39 - javascript that's the most important
17:41 - thing and then further down the line
17:44 - progress is
17:46 - you know they expect to see progress
17:48 - from you you know stop
17:50 - putting in-line styles in your html
17:52 - start using css morse start writing
17:55 - multiple css to make the codes short and
17:58 - clean
17:59 - and so from it's just really
18:01 - building more and more experience seeing
18:03 - um not more experience i'm sorry uh just
18:06 - seeing progress
18:09 - yeah
18:10 - yes
18:17 - uh someone from twitch said what
18:19 - frameworks in javascript you would like
18:22 - to use um so i'm really into react um i
18:26 - want to get to learn react more
18:29 - that's something i want to eventually do
18:32 - but hopefully react in angular something
18:34 - i'm interested
18:36 - once i get my jquery down
18:39 - yeah
18:40 - thanks
18:44 - anybody else
18:48 - oh okay yes
18:57 - he said what skill set did i learn from
19:00 - star space 40
19:01 - teclahoma star space 46 is the
19:04 - organization that i could apply to my
19:07 - job um honestly it's how to start out
19:09 - and find a job like how to connect i got
19:11 - a lot of advice from kimberly too she's

19:26 - and building my resume always link your
19:30 - github you know your portfolio on top of
19:32 - your resume so that people can see that
19:34 - the first thing that was something i did
19:36 - that on my resume but i linked my
19:38 - portfolio in the back and you don't want
19:40 - to do that smart to do in the front so
19:42 - that everybody could see
19:44 - um and a lot is just like you know help
19:47 - like debug learning how to use my
19:48 - console that's what i learned
19:50 - and yeah

hi everyone my name is christine and i'm a frontend web developer i actually just started programming six months ago and i found my first dev job about three months so now i've been a web developer for about three to four months now and i really love it so this talk i'm just gonna give a little background about myself and my interest in coding and also how what i did to land my first job so i graduated from the university of oklahoma about four years ago with the political science degree and i didn't really know what exactly to do with a political science degree i was confused and lost and so i decided that i wanted to be a lawyer or be a makeup artist be other different things i had so many different hobbies that i wanted to do and i contemplated thought about it and i realized that those are the type of jobs that i might not be interested in the long run and so i got into coding when i landed my first job in the marketing field and i worked with html templates in wysiwyg and a lot of the stuff that i did before was mainly just coding uh the tables inside the wysiwyg very simple stuff and i realized that i wanted to do more in life i didn't want to stay at my old job because you know i just feel like i would plateau quickly so i looked around for different types of classes i looked into getting a computer science degree but i realized that you don't really need a computer science degree to do web development and i really like web development because i like art and design so i feel like that would be something i'm good at so i looked around online for some classes and a lot of the classes were really expensive one class to learn javascript was about two grand that i saw and so i was like you know i feel like i could find something else you know maybe try different routes some other classes that may be cheaper and then i saw ok coders which is where i met carson he was one of my instructors at ok coders and had helped me a lot throughout my journey so i just want to say thank you carson very very much but uh so i found ok coders and it's basically a six month module or six modules six months long bootcamp class every saturday and you learn everything about web development starting with beginning with html css you learn how to use your command line you learn how to use your github where you push all your files and into github and then also javascript libraries which is really really important if you're looking to be a frontend developer so yeah i attended bootcamp for about six months and a lot of the work i had to code i have to practice coding every single day and get better the classes were only four hours long every week and i knew that you have to put extra work into um you have to put in the extra work outside of class so you know i studied a lot i read all my documentation that's probably the most important thing is reading your documentation starting out and that's what i did i use all my online resources i practice on codeacademy udemy lynda.com those are great if you want to get into coding those are great online resources to take and practice on i also asked a lot of help from people i joined teclahoma met a lot of the great developers in the community and just getting advice from people or people who have experience in this type of career really helped me love being a developer even more the excitement of you know seeing people creating so many cool uh things it's just sorry i got nervous but creating a lot of cool things is just amazing and and i think that's why we all want to be developers is that we want to create something and build something of our own and so um anyways i practice a lot and then i was also looking for a job at the same time knowing that i'm probably not qualified but i gave it a shot anyways i just kept trying and i attended job fairs and brushed up my resume i created a portfolio i created a lot of side projects and pushed everything to my github to show that i put in a lot of work even if i know my code wasn't that great i just pushed everything into my github and then finally got my first dev job at a marketing company who's willing to take this opportunity opportunity on me even though they know that i'm probably i'm still really new and not fully qualified um i got the job and i was really excited got a little content and about two weeks ago i actually almost lost my job because i wasn't practicing enough outside of work and that's the most important things that i want to tell you guys starting out as a developer if you have not much or no prior program experience you have to practice even when you get the job you have to practice outside work and i just i got to continue i was too happy and i relaxed and then you know i was in a very tough spot where they said that i need to improve or it just won't work out and i was given two weeks to show improvement at my job and i did it and it was very it was a lot of work um i just whatever i did at work i showed them and i had better communication with my senior developers that's also one important thing that you guys have to know is communication with your fellow developers that was one thing that i didn't do very well i i was the type of person that i wanted to learn everything my frontend skills weren't even that great and i wanted to learn to do php and sql and all the backend and i took in work that i don't even know what i was coding they gave me php and sql and i'm just sitting here trying to figure it out when i realized that sometimes you have to say no when you're not ready for something you have to say no and so i was honest to them and said hey i'm i'm not ready for this yet and i need to practice on my frontend skills and that's what i did so when you get your new job when you get your developer job make sure you are fluent with all your languages before jumping into something else for me i just i just wanted to learn everything i couldn't say no because i was scared to say no i wanted i wanted to learn everything and be good at everything and sometimes you know it's you have to take it one step at a time i thought being a developer means you have to know you know react you have to know angular even though at my job we use jquery like i wanted to learn react and angular i want to do all these things but i know i have to take it one step at a time and that's the important thing another thing is besides that is getting feedback from your senior devs and you know just your fellow developers that you're working with especially when you're new getting feedback is great knowing your work process like how you're doing always ask them like how am i doing do you think i'm doing okay because i know everyone has their own different techniques so it's best to just have a good communication and getting feedback from your peers and another one is never stop practicing always keep learning i'm still in the learning process right now i mean a couple weeks ago i was here trying to debug a bootstrap carousel and i felt embarrassed debugging a bootstrap carousel because i'm like well this is so simple like why can't i get it but i learned that it's still a learning process for me i'm still i'm still learning i'm still continuing to grow and sometimes it's okay to ask for help even something so simple like bootstrap carousel or learning how to use bootstrap it's never embarrassing to ask questions because you actually learn from asking questions just don't ask the same questions over and over ask and absorb that's the most important thing but yeah and then another thing is oh yeah this is probably important too but try to use the same ides as your fellow developers i know we all have you know a preference that we use like i like visual studio code um that's just my preference but i know like at my job and stuff we use php storm or like adam and stuff like that i just think it's you don't you don't have to do it but i think it helps with the workflow and the process when you use the same ide as your fellow peers that usually helps a lot and then another tip is when you get your first project it's always good to whiteboard it out draw a map of how you're going to build your website you know have an idea before you actually start coding that was my mistake too is i didn't really have an idea and so i kind of just start coding random things when you have to wipe word it out you have to talk to your boss don't try to take initiative with anything not well don't try to take initiative with everything beside and not letting your fellow developers know always always try to wipe board it out and then another thing is um biddle law side projects if you have anything you're interested in building do it after work hours you know take the weekend off don't go out with your friends like if you have to improve you have to just start practicing more and more build something cool like i want to eventually build an app but i don't know what happened yet but um another thing is don't be afraid to try new things um code something different don't code the same thing over and over right now since i'm still pretty new i am practicing on building my jquery maps i built a couple maps before and but i'm still practicing i'm not that great with the map i'm learning how to style maps with javascript so build something new try something new at least every single week and you'll get better and just learn that way let's see what else okay but yeah it's um so that's all i really have with the tips and advice and my story is just really practicing using your online resources talk to your peers also have good communication with your boss when finding a job push yourself out there join organizations that's what i did you know i joined teclahoma i joined free code camp i talked with my instructors that's the most important thing it's just communicating with fellow developers that could give you really good advice and also don't take criticism as an insult always take criticism as something you can prove and learn from and that's the most important thing is um and then yeah getting feedback positive side projects draw a map yeah that's really all that i have i know it's kind of short but if anyone has any questions or yeah well my interview was actually very short i didn't really take a test or anything i know some companies require you to take a test i actually took a test a couple weeks before that with an hr recruiter when i was trying to find a job just testing my javascript and i did alright on that but they didn't hire me on another company saw that i was very motivated to learn and try new things and also they liked the fact that at my previous job i wore many hats like i did all the digital content at my job and i was lucky enough because the company i work for really needed someone and so i got the job as a web developer yeah and that's i just told them my experience and everything gave him my portfolio and then yeah from there the most useful thing that i did was mainly reading my documentation in the beginning i can't i can't say this enough but reading your documentation is so so important that's what i spent my time doing outside of work now is just reading through everything carefully and even though i was in boot camp class i missed like the little things here and there because i was trying to code out my portfolio but even when i coded out it still wasn't it wasn't good i did a lot of what i did was i would always inspect right click inspect in my console and then just go in there in a debug but when you actually read your documentation clearly and thoroughly it really helps you to understand what you're doing a lot more so i can just code it out now fluently rather than having to inspect all the time and so i did that and then just practice a lot online outside of work that was probably the most useful things that i did as a developer yes well it's like so like on bootstrap saying you know it gives you all the elements and stuff so they have um your columns how to build bootstrap columns um how to do responsive media queries and stuff like that when you really read it through it helps you understand how to build your columns on your web page when i started out i didn't know that in every div container there are 12 columns and reading that part made me understand that now instead of having to inspect my element every time i know that if i were to build two comps it's just automatically column md6 column md6 and so forth so it's like reading your documentation really helps you understand that and also once you get your html css and those skills down it'll help you understand javascript more because you'll learn how to use dom elements and that's the key thing so yeah really read your documentation man anybody else yeah well now eight months because i've been in my job for about three and a half months now but i got actually got my first job at my last module coders bootcamp class so yeah yes you just have to show oh i'm sorry sorry can you say it oh okay sorry okay so he said that when you're a new developer what does your company expect out of you when you first started versus three months in so when you first started they want you to get to get familiar with their process of working and also how they you know just really focus on their software um i'm not sure how other jobs are but i know my company we use a software where we import all our code codes in and the software was built by our lead senior developer and so that's the main thing is when you first started out is learning how to use the software where to place your header code where to place the footer where do you place your link tags and everything in that where do you place your javascript that's the most important thing and then further down the line progress is you know they expect to see progress from you you know stop putting inline styles in your html start using css morse start writing multiple css to make the codes short and clean and so from it's just really building more and more experience seeing um not more experience i'm sorry uh just seeing progress yeah yes uh someone from twitch said what frameworks in javascript you would like to use um so i'm really into react um i want to get to learn react more that's something i want to eventually do but hopefully react in angular something i'm interested once i get my jquery down yeah thanks anybody else oh okay yes he said what skill set did i learn from star space 40 teclahoma star space 46 is the organization that i could apply to my job um honestly it's how to start out and find a job like how to connect i got a lot of advice from kimberly too she's great she's great i got a lot of advice from her on how to build my resume she gave me a lot of tips and then another person i like to mention is carmen she's helped me a lot too and building my resume always link your github you know your portfolio on top of your resume so that people can see that the first thing that was something i did that on my resume but i linked my portfolio in the back and you don't want to do that smart to do in the front so that everybody could see um and a lot is just like you know help like debug learning how to use my console that's what i learned and yeah anybody else yes uh currently i am building my friend's wedding website right now it's good i like it it's not the best but i like it and that and then i coded out a tictactoe game yeah nothing too advanced but hey i'll get there you know you'll get there i don't know if you're new but anyway anybody else no okay well thank you so much everyone thank you kimberly and teklahoma and everybody um having me here today i hope i could shed some light in anybody that who wants to be a developer make sure to practice practice a lot read your documentation yeah okay
