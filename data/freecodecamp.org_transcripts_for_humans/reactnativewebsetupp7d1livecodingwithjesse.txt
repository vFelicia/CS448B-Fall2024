With timestamps:

00:08 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:10 - with jesse uh it's good to be back it's
00:13 - been
00:14 - a long time
00:16 - so sorry i started a little bit later
00:18 - then scheduled uh i'm having some issues
00:22 - with um
00:25 - with the stream so
00:28 - let me know if you can hear me if you
00:30 - can see me
00:31 - um
00:33 - the it it may be bad uh so i had to
00:37 - force quit some applications
00:39 - uh right now i have very little running
00:42 - on my machine
00:44 - so
00:45 - today
00:50 - i'ma wait to hear back and see if you
00:51 - can hear me and see me before i go into
00:54 - this
00:55 - so let me know
01:01 - all right well nobody's saying there's
01:03 - something wrong usually
01:04 - that happens quickly if something is
01:06 - wrong so
01:10 - uh i guess i'll just start
01:12 - so
01:13 - really quick uh
01:15 - here's why i haven't been streaming
01:18 - um
01:19 - i got a new job
01:21 - and before my old job i could live
01:23 - stream while i was at work at my new job
01:25 - i can't also i have a longer commute for
01:28 - my new job so it's been tough to find a
01:31 - time
01:32 - where i can i can actually stream so the
01:35 - plan now is i think i could consistently
01:38 - stream around 8am eastern time
01:42 - on wednesdays and fridays so i'm gonna
01:45 - try to do that
01:47 - and i'd like to do a project with react
01:49 - native web that's what i'm working with
01:51 - for my my new job so
01:55 - i think it'll be better if i if i stick
01:57 - with that
01:59 - that way i'll know what's going on and
02:01 - the stream and the project at work uh
02:04 - can kind of like
02:06 - play off of each other
02:08 - so
02:13 - hey everybody there's a lot of people
02:15 - saying hi just say hello
02:17 - um
02:19 - so this stream is gonna be kind of like
02:21 - a short stream compared to some of my
02:22 - older ones so i'm going to keep it maybe
02:24 - like a half an hour
02:25 - [Music]
02:27 - maybe a little bit longer
02:29 - and
02:31 - for this stream i'm just going to set up
02:34 - a react native web project
02:38 - so really quickly react native so
02:41 - react is a javascript library
02:44 - that helps you to build progressive web
02:46 - apps
02:48 - react native
02:50 - is
02:51 - a javascript library
02:54 - that allows you to create
02:56 - mobile apps
02:58 - using react
03:00 - you can also create other things so
03:02 - essentially you have this base of of
03:05 - react that you can code
03:08 - and then it can be turned into other
03:10 - applications
03:12 - right that can run natively on different
03:14 - devices so not just android and ios
03:19 - or
03:19 - you know windows
03:21 - machine but also
03:24 - you could
03:26 - there there are other things so like a
03:27 - vr application right or
03:33 - in this case
03:34 - we're going to
03:36 - use react native
03:38 - and have it run as a website
03:41 - on the web it looks like my image is
03:44 - frozen
03:45 - so
03:48 - right now i guess as long as you can
03:50 - hear me i'm okay with that
03:53 - so
03:55 - why would we want to do this this sounds
03:57 - crazy why not just use react well the
04:00 - reason being you can write
04:02 - most of your code
04:04 - and
04:05 - and react native
04:07 - with
04:08 - some slight alterations depending on
04:10 - platform and run it on many platforms
04:13 - so we build for the web but at the same
04:16 - time
04:17 - we could very easily
04:20 - turn that into
04:21 - an ios app an android app
04:26 - and whatever else you know comes out
04:29 - that
04:30 - uh react native can
04:32 - kind of compile into i guess so
04:36 - that's why i'm using react native at
04:38 - work so that we could very easily be
04:40 - cross platform
04:43 - and that's why i want to use it with
04:44 - this project
04:46 - so let's get to some code
04:48 - and
04:50 - if my image is frozen
04:53 - well let's do this
04:57 - i'm gonna get rid of the video for now
05:05 - okay so
05:06 - that should help
05:09 - maybe a little bit with like frame rate
05:11 - and stuff or with
05:12 - the freezing
05:14 - um the video seems to be a little bit
05:17 - more resource intensive
05:20 - so first thing we're going to do
05:22 - i am on a mac so this may be slightly
05:24 - different on windows but i want to open
05:27 - visuals actually let's open
05:30 - first things first let's open a
05:34 - chrome
05:35 - window
05:44 - okay
05:45 - [Music]
05:47 - should be back now
05:51 - let me know uh how it is now
05:58 - it looks like
06:00 - on my end it looks like it's better
06:04 - so hopefully it is a bit better
06:06 - um
06:11 - let me know i'm gonna you know what it's
06:13 - not the internet connection
06:16 - for me it's um
06:19 - it's my machine
06:23 - so i just think that
06:25 - my macbook pro is a little bit old it
06:26 - doesn't have the the specs to handle
06:30 - streaming like this so
06:32 - i'll try to figure out something else
06:33 - this may be a great excuse for me to get
06:35 - a new computer
06:37 - uh so we'll we'll see
06:42 - okay
06:43 - so the resolution is probably lower now
06:46 - so i'm going to try to make the the font
06:49 - as large as i possibly can
06:53 - and
06:55 - let's try to
07:02 - huh
07:08 - all right
07:11 - yeah if if the um
07:15 - if the video is too bad
07:17 - then maybe check out the recording that
07:19 - should be available a little later
07:23 - hopefully it'll be better but anyway
07:25 - this is create react app
07:29 - you can check this out more on your own
07:31 - if you'd like
07:33 - but basically we're going to do
07:36 - npx create react app and then we'll just
07:38 - name the app
07:40 - so let me open up a terminal
07:44 - i use i term
07:55 - remind me later okay
07:57 - so
08:02 - i'll make this as big as i can
08:04 - so you can see it
08:06 - all right so this is just you know
08:08 - regular terminal
08:10 - um i've gone into my projects folder
08:14 - we're gonna do create react app and now
08:16 - let's name it and for now um let's say
08:20 - uh
08:21 - fcc
08:29 - um
08:30 - react actually let's do
08:35 - let's do it like this
08:38 - it's going to be a weird name but
08:41 - for
08:42 - react native uh especially when you're
08:45 - going to try to do this
08:47 - your naming restrictions
08:48 - oh you can't contain capital letters
08:50 - okay
08:51 - let's just call it um
09:02 - it's gonna be all together
09:04 - oops what am i doing
09:14 - so
09:15 - there's an issue when you try to
09:19 - use this with mobile
09:23 - that you can't have hyphens in your name
09:28 - so that's why i was doing it all
09:30 - together like that
09:32 - alright so this is going to do its thing
09:34 - and
09:35 - it's probably gonna take a little while
09:37 - since we're
09:39 - streaming at the same time so i'm gonna
09:41 - check out the live chat a little bit
09:47 - uh
09:52 - okay so it looks like the frame rate's
09:54 - still really bad
09:58 - and that's probably since i started
10:00 - doing this
10:04 - hmm
10:18 - okay
10:38 - [Music]
10:42 - it's
10:47 - yeah you know at this point
10:52 - if i put the settings any lower
10:54 - i'll be streaming at
10:57 - 480
10:58 - and
11:03 - that means the recording that will be
11:05 - available afterwards will still be at
11:07 - 480.
11:09 - so i really don't want that it's it's
11:11 - really hard to see the code
11:13 - so i may just have to try streaming from
11:15 - a different machine next time
11:22 - hopefully
11:25 - what i'm going to shoot for for this
11:26 - stream is
11:29 - let's just try to get this installed so
11:32 - i can at least show you the package json
11:34 - file and how we're going to set that up
11:39 - and also if anybody has any questions go
11:42 - ahead and put it in the live chat right
11:43 - now and at least i can answer some
11:45 - questions while we're waiting
11:48 - let's see
11:52 - i'm just going to scroll down through
11:54 - the chat a little bit to see if anybody
11:55 - had asked anything
12:12 - oh hey john hanson's here
12:15 - how's it going
12:30 - um
12:38 - okay
12:41 - all right giuliano says it's working at
12:44 - uh 360 dpi
12:46 - all right not ideal but
12:49 - that's working
12:50 - yeah sorry for the really bad quality of
12:53 - the stream
12:55 - this is way worse than it was the last
12:56 - time i tried to stream on this computer
12:58 - so
12:59 - i'm not sure what
13:01 - what changed
13:02 - uh but it seems like something has
13:04 - changed to make it even worse
13:07 - so next time i stream
13:10 - i am definitely going to change things
13:12 - up
13:14 - um kid brave it's definitely not you the
13:16 - video is freezing a lot it's it's
13:19 - entirely
13:20 - um my fault
13:23 - so
13:24 - wow this might take a little while
13:30 - hmm
13:36 - yeah
13:36 - and this is making this take forever
13:38 - okay
13:40 - so
13:44 - i'm probably not going to make you all
13:46 - suffer through that much more of this
13:51 - is it actually done now
13:54 - um
13:55 - so
13:56 - this stream will just basically be an
13:58 - introduction to the project then hey
14:00 - wonderful it did stop
14:03 - all right so now that we've
14:05 - created uh this project using create
14:08 - react app
14:09 - we're gonna actually go into the project
14:12 - so we're gonna cd fcc
14:14 - react native web now we're into the
14:16 - project and now we can go
14:18 - we can open that up in visual studio
14:20 - code which is my code editor
14:23 - of choice
14:27 - and
14:28 - basically we're going to do almost
14:29 - everything from there so we don't even
14:31 - need this terminal anymore so i'm going
14:33 - to go ahead and shut that down
14:41 - and
14:42 - hopefully
14:44 - visual studio code will actually load up
14:55 - so for those of you that join maybe a
14:57 - little bit later
14:59 - we're starting a brand new project
15:02 - this is going to be like a side project
15:04 - for me
15:05 - so
15:07 - not would i
15:11 - what i've done in the other streams
15:14 - is no longer responding
15:17 - let's just keep waiting a little bit
15:19 - longer
15:26 - so i can't stream my actual like work
15:29 - projects anymore my full-time job but
15:32 - i'm gonna do a side project and i'm
15:33 - gonna try to use the same technology
15:35 - that i am using in my project uh for my
15:38 - my normal job
15:44 - let's see
15:45 - okay so
15:48 - we're in here
15:50 - and
15:51 - this is our package json file you can
15:54 - see right away it's very basic
15:57 - but it has it definitely has what we
15:59 - need
16:02 - okay so what we need to add
16:05 - in addition to this
16:07 - is we need to add react um
16:10 - react native
16:11 - and react native web
16:14 - i have to double check here maybe we
16:16 - don't need react
16:20 - native yeah we may just need react
16:23 - native web
16:25 - i'm actually not going to try to load
16:26 - this package here seeing as it took
16:29 - forever
16:30 - uh to get this working before
16:32 - so we'll add in react native web
16:36 - and at that point we'll need to add in
16:39 - some things so
16:44 - we need to add this into
16:48 - is this do we need to add this in our
16:49 - config
16:50 - clues built-in support
16:53 - okay you know what we don't need to add
16:55 - this i had to use it on a
16:57 - a project at work but
17:02 - we should be all right
17:05 - basically react native web works by like
17:08 - aliasing
17:09 - um
17:11 - parts of react
17:13 - so you could see like if we were to do
17:15 - it manually
17:16 - we do it with webpack
17:18 - also babel
17:21 - but if we use create react app this
17:23 - should
17:24 - work
17:25 - right off the bat and basically allow us
17:27 - to write react native
17:30 - code with create react app which is very
17:33 - convenient
17:37 - alright so we would add that in and then
17:39 - in addition to our
17:41 - normal
17:43 - so basically
17:44 - instead of our normal react script start
17:49 - we would have a start for
17:52 - like react native web
17:58 - and that would bring up a react native
18:00 - code in a web browser
18:03 - and we'd be able to work on it like a
18:04 - normal react project
18:06 - at the same time we could also
18:09 - use react native
18:12 - to bring up the project
18:15 - um as an ios app or an android app like
18:19 - in a simulator or in a connected device
18:22 - so
18:23 - for now for the project
18:25 - we're just going to stick with the web
18:27 - version because
18:29 - it obviously my my machine can't even
18:32 - really handle this but when you try to
18:34 - open up a simulator like ios simulator
18:38 - it takes a lot of resources so even if i
18:40 - had a really good computer it would
18:42 - still probably mess up the stream so
18:44 - we're just going to stick with the web
18:46 - if you'd like
18:48 - to
18:49 - do it for as as an app
18:52 - we can go over that
18:53 - but i can't really stream that
18:56 - successfully unless i get a really
18:58 - awesome computer
19:00 - so
19:04 - i think i'm going to start wrapping
19:06 - things up i'm going to answer a few
19:07 - questions that i see here and then we're
19:09 - going to wrap things up for today
19:12 - i'll try to stream
19:15 - again
19:16 - at the very least i'll try to stream
19:18 - like wednesday morning
19:20 - with a better setup
19:23 - uh it's possible that i might be able to
19:25 - do some weekend streams too
19:27 - uh if you want to get notified about
19:29 - that subscribe to this channel free code
19:31 - camp channel turn on your notifications
19:33 - you can follow me on twitter infos below
19:36 - you can follow me on instagram i notify
19:38 - everyone on instagram and twitter when
19:39 - i'm about to stream
19:41 - um i have a lot of pre-recorded videos
19:43 - if you want to see those you can go to
19:45 - my youtube channel the links in the
19:46 - description to this video
19:50 - uh and
19:52 - i think we got a react question so john
19:54 - hanson says
19:56 - what's the best place to use a switch
19:58 - statement as a function
20:00 - inside render or in the return the
20:04 - switch will load different children
20:05 - components based on
20:08 - a state change
20:11 - okay that's interesting
20:18 - hmm
20:29 - if i were doing it
20:31 - i don't know that i've tried to use a
20:33 - switch statement inside the render or
20:35 - not but it seems like inside the render
20:37 - function would be better
20:40 - for those of you who aren't familiar
20:42 - with
20:43 - what we're talking about this might help
20:45 - to show
20:47 - something
20:49 - if it'll come up
20:51 - so like when we're talking about the
20:53 - the render function
20:58 - i'm sorry the return
21:01 - so
21:05 - if it allows it which i'm not sure if if
21:08 - it would allow it or not to put a switch
21:10 - statement in the return i've never tried
21:11 - it
21:12 - it would make sense
21:15 - to put it in the return
21:16 - and just have different things come up
21:19 - you usually i just use ternaries
21:21 - inside
21:23 - the return
21:25 - and
21:27 - that that usually works but it could get
21:29 - complicated if you had a lot of options
21:34 - um let's see
21:38 - yeah
21:39 - john if you end up trying that and it
21:41 - works let me know i'd really like to see
21:43 - that because i've never attempted it
21:44 - before
21:46 - what i have done before is used a
21:48 - ternary like out here
21:52 - and the ternary would
21:55 - change the state
21:56 - right then depending on the value of
21:59 - state it would render things in here so
22:02 - there would be something like
22:05 - for this component
22:07 - it would say something like i don't know
22:09 - route
22:11 - let's just call it route
22:13 - um
22:14 - we would say right this
22:17 - state
22:21 - this state route
22:22 - and then
22:24 - i would say like equals
22:27 - and let's just say
22:29 - home
22:30 - okay let's say we have a string of home
22:33 - and
22:35 - now we're going to say
22:39 - um
22:41 - and and then we'd put a component here
22:44 - and then what that would do is say okay
22:47 - if the route equals home we're going to
22:49 - render this home component and then
22:51 - you'd wrap each component in something
22:53 - like this
22:54 - but the value
22:55 - of this state route would be different
22:58 - for each one
22:59 - then you have your switch statement up
23:01 - here that changes state
23:03 - so
23:06 - that would essentially achieve the same
23:09 - thing
23:11 - you would add a bit more code
23:14 - um but then you wouldn't put a switch
23:16 - statement in the return
23:18 - which i know this works i'm not sure if
23:21 - a switch statement works
23:25 - that makes sense
23:28 - has anybody else tried to work with
23:29 - switch statements in um in the return
23:38 - all right uh neymar asks what's this for
23:41 - uh we're working with react native um
23:44 - it's just a live stream to show
23:46 - like what is the process is like to code
23:49 - without rehearsing
23:52 - and there's there's a lot of mistakes
23:53 - that happen and like we we just go
23:55 - through them together
23:58 - um
23:59 - we have a question about suggesting a
24:01 - good es6 through 8 course
24:05 - um

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse uh it's good to be back it's been a long time so sorry i started a little bit later then scheduled uh i'm having some issues with um with the stream so let me know if you can hear me if you can see me um the it it may be bad uh so i had to force quit some applications uh right now i have very little running on my machine so today i'ma wait to hear back and see if you can hear me and see me before i go into this so let me know all right well nobody's saying there's something wrong usually that happens quickly if something is wrong so uh i guess i'll just start so really quick uh here's why i haven't been streaming um i got a new job and before my old job i could live stream while i was at work at my new job i can't also i have a longer commute for my new job so it's been tough to find a time where i can i can actually stream so the plan now is i think i could consistently stream around 8am eastern time on wednesdays and fridays so i'm gonna try to do that and i'd like to do a project with react native web that's what i'm working with for my my new job so i think it'll be better if i if i stick with that that way i'll know what's going on and the stream and the project at work uh can kind of like play off of each other so hey everybody there's a lot of people saying hi just say hello um so this stream is gonna be kind of like a short stream compared to some of my older ones so i'm going to keep it maybe like a half an hour maybe a little bit longer and for this stream i'm just going to set up a react native web project so really quickly react native so react is a javascript library that helps you to build progressive web apps react native is a javascript library that allows you to create mobile apps using react you can also create other things so essentially you have this base of of react that you can code and then it can be turned into other applications right that can run natively on different devices so not just android and ios or you know windows machine but also you could there there are other things so like a vr application right or in this case we're going to use react native and have it run as a website on the web it looks like my image is frozen so right now i guess as long as you can hear me i'm okay with that so why would we want to do this this sounds crazy why not just use react well the reason being you can write most of your code and and react native with some slight alterations depending on platform and run it on many platforms so we build for the web but at the same time we could very easily turn that into an ios app an android app and whatever else you know comes out that uh react native can kind of compile into i guess so that's why i'm using react native at work so that we could very easily be cross platform and that's why i want to use it with this project so let's get to some code and if my image is frozen well let's do this i'm gonna get rid of the video for now okay so that should help maybe a little bit with like frame rate and stuff or with the freezing um the video seems to be a little bit more resource intensive so first thing we're going to do i am on a mac so this may be slightly different on windows but i want to open visuals actually let's open first things first let's open a chrome window okay should be back now let me know uh how it is now it looks like on my end it looks like it's better so hopefully it is a bit better um let me know i'm gonna you know what it's not the internet connection for me it's um it's my machine so i just think that my macbook pro is a little bit old it doesn't have the the specs to handle streaming like this so i'll try to figure out something else this may be a great excuse for me to get a new computer uh so we'll we'll see okay so the resolution is probably lower now so i'm going to try to make the the font as large as i possibly can and let's try to huh all right yeah if if the um if the video is too bad then maybe check out the recording that should be available a little later hopefully it'll be better but anyway this is create react app you can check this out more on your own if you'd like but basically we're going to do npx create react app and then we'll just name the app so let me open up a terminal i use i term remind me later okay so i'll make this as big as i can so you can see it all right so this is just you know regular terminal um i've gone into my projects folder we're gonna do create react app and now let's name it and for now um let's say uh fcc um react actually let's do let's do it like this it's going to be a weird name but for react native uh especially when you're going to try to do this your naming restrictions oh you can't contain capital letters okay let's just call it um it's gonna be all together oops what am i doing so there's an issue when you try to use this with mobile that you can't have hyphens in your name so that's why i was doing it all together like that alright so this is going to do its thing and it's probably gonna take a little while since we're streaming at the same time so i'm gonna check out the live chat a little bit uh okay so it looks like the frame rate's still really bad and that's probably since i started doing this hmm okay it's yeah you know at this point if i put the settings any lower i'll be streaming at 480 and that means the recording that will be available afterwards will still be at 480. so i really don't want that it's it's really hard to see the code so i may just have to try streaming from a different machine next time hopefully what i'm going to shoot for for this stream is let's just try to get this installed so i can at least show you the package json file and how we're going to set that up and also if anybody has any questions go ahead and put it in the live chat right now and at least i can answer some questions while we're waiting let's see i'm just going to scroll down through the chat a little bit to see if anybody had asked anything oh hey john hanson's here how's it going um okay all right giuliano says it's working at uh 360 dpi all right not ideal but that's working yeah sorry for the really bad quality of the stream this is way worse than it was the last time i tried to stream on this computer so i'm not sure what what changed uh but it seems like something has changed to make it even worse so next time i stream i am definitely going to change things up um kid brave it's definitely not you the video is freezing a lot it's it's entirely um my fault so wow this might take a little while hmm yeah and this is making this take forever okay so i'm probably not going to make you all suffer through that much more of this is it actually done now um so this stream will just basically be an introduction to the project then hey wonderful it did stop all right so now that we've created uh this project using create react app we're gonna actually go into the project so we're gonna cd fcc react native web now we're into the project and now we can go we can open that up in visual studio code which is my code editor of choice and basically we're going to do almost everything from there so we don't even need this terminal anymore so i'm going to go ahead and shut that down and hopefully visual studio code will actually load up so for those of you that join maybe a little bit later we're starting a brand new project this is going to be like a side project for me so not would i what i've done in the other streams is no longer responding let's just keep waiting a little bit longer so i can't stream my actual like work projects anymore my fulltime job but i'm gonna do a side project and i'm gonna try to use the same technology that i am using in my project uh for my my normal job let's see okay so we're in here and this is our package json file you can see right away it's very basic but it has it definitely has what we need okay so what we need to add in addition to this is we need to add react um react native and react native web i have to double check here maybe we don't need react native yeah we may just need react native web i'm actually not going to try to load this package here seeing as it took forever uh to get this working before so we'll add in react native web and at that point we'll need to add in some things so we need to add this into is this do we need to add this in our config clues builtin support okay you know what we don't need to add this i had to use it on a a project at work but we should be all right basically react native web works by like aliasing um parts of react so you could see like if we were to do it manually we do it with webpack also babel but if we use create react app this should work right off the bat and basically allow us to write react native code with create react app which is very convenient alright so we would add that in and then in addition to our normal so basically instead of our normal react script start we would have a start for like react native web and that would bring up a react native code in a web browser and we'd be able to work on it like a normal react project at the same time we could also use react native to bring up the project um as an ios app or an android app like in a simulator or in a connected device so for now for the project we're just going to stick with the web version because it obviously my my machine can't even really handle this but when you try to open up a simulator like ios simulator it takes a lot of resources so even if i had a really good computer it would still probably mess up the stream so we're just going to stick with the web if you'd like to do it for as as an app we can go over that but i can't really stream that successfully unless i get a really awesome computer so i think i'm going to start wrapping things up i'm going to answer a few questions that i see here and then we're going to wrap things up for today i'll try to stream again at the very least i'll try to stream like wednesday morning with a better setup uh it's possible that i might be able to do some weekend streams too uh if you want to get notified about that subscribe to this channel free code camp channel turn on your notifications you can follow me on twitter infos below you can follow me on instagram i notify everyone on instagram and twitter when i'm about to stream um i have a lot of prerecorded videos if you want to see those you can go to my youtube channel the links in the description to this video uh and i think we got a react question so john hanson says what's the best place to use a switch statement as a function inside render or in the return the switch will load different children components based on a state change okay that's interesting hmm if i were doing it i don't know that i've tried to use a switch statement inside the render or not but it seems like inside the render function would be better for those of you who aren't familiar with what we're talking about this might help to show something if it'll come up so like when we're talking about the the render function i'm sorry the return so if it allows it which i'm not sure if if it would allow it or not to put a switch statement in the return i've never tried it it would make sense to put it in the return and just have different things come up you usually i just use ternaries inside the return and that that usually works but it could get complicated if you had a lot of options um let's see yeah john if you end up trying that and it works let me know i'd really like to see that because i've never attempted it before what i have done before is used a ternary like out here and the ternary would change the state right then depending on the value of state it would render things in here so there would be something like for this component it would say something like i don't know route let's just call it route um we would say right this state this state route and then i would say like equals and let's just say home okay let's say we have a string of home and now we're going to say um and and then we'd put a component here and then what that would do is say okay if the route equals home we're going to render this home component and then you'd wrap each component in something like this but the value of this state route would be different for each one then you have your switch statement up here that changes state so that would essentially achieve the same thing you would add a bit more code um but then you wouldn't put a switch statement in the return which i know this works i'm not sure if a switch statement works that makes sense has anybody else tried to work with switch statements in um in the return all right uh neymar asks what's this for uh we're working with react native um it's just a live stream to show like what is the process is like to code without rehearsing and there's there's a lot of mistakes that happen and like we we just go through them together um we have a question about suggesting a good es6 through 8 course um
