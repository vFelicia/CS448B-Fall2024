00:00 - in this video i'm going to talk about
00:02 - effects you can do in jquery we just
00:04 - have a few elements on the page i have
00:06 - an image an h1 tag and then a paragraph
00:10 - that you can see on the page there and
00:12 - i'm going to first talk about the hide
00:14 - event
00:16 - so we'll just type in the jquery
00:18 - selector and then we're just going to do
00:20 - a dot hide
00:22 - and that's it so if i run this code with
00:25 - just the image.hide it's going to hide
00:27 - the image the image just disappears you
00:29 - can see now it's like that image isn't
00:31 - even in the code there and if you need
00:34 - help adding jquery to your website you
00:36 - can check out my first video on jquery
00:38 - where i show you how to add jquery
00:41 - after you hide an element you can show
00:44 - the element so i just have to select it
00:46 - again
00:48 - and then just do dot show
00:50 - and now you're barely even going to be
00:52 - able to tell anything because it's going
00:53 - to hide it and then show it right away
00:55 - so hide and show just hides and show
00:58 - instantly but you can use animation in a
01:01 - couple of ways so you can pass in
01:04 - arguments to hide and show so it won't
01:06 - do it instantly i can pass in
01:09 - slow to make it a slow effect or fast
01:13 - to make a fast effect you can also use
01:16 - normal so let's see what that looks like
01:20 - see it disappeared slowly and then it
01:22 - came back quickly so instead of putting
01:25 - words slow and fast you can also put the
01:27 - number of milliseconds so i'm going to
01:29 - put 500 milliseconds to hide it that's a
01:32 - half a second and then 1 500
01:35 - milliseconds to show at 1.5 seconds so
01:37 - let's see what that looks like
01:41 - okay so you can really do any speed you
01:44 - want by just passing in a number like
01:46 - that and let's just see what that looks
01:47 - like if i do it on the h1 tag so here
01:50 - i'm going to change this to h1
01:52 - and let's try that
01:55 - so you can see it looks actually kind of
01:57 - different on the h1 so the show and hide
01:59 - effect use a combination of slide and
02:01 - fade effects with the the slide effect
02:04 - it's actually just changing the height
02:06 - really quickly so it's lowering the
02:08 - height and to zero and with an image
02:11 - when you lower the height it also
02:12 - automatically changes so it changes the
02:14 - width but with an h1 when you change the
02:16 - height it does not automatically change
02:18 - the width so that's why the h1 looked
02:20 - like it was just coming straight down
02:22 - and up and then the image looked like it
02:24 - was going into a little corner so show
02:26 - and hide used slide and fade at the same
02:29 - time but you can also use one or the
02:32 - other so instead of hide or show i'm
02:33 - going to use slide up
02:35 - or i can use slide down
02:39 - so now it's not going to change the
02:41 - opacity at all it's just going to slide
02:44 - up and down and you can still use the
02:45 - slow normal or fast or you can use
02:49 - specific number of milliseconds with
02:50 - this so let's see what that looks like
02:55 - and so it just slides up and down
02:58 - or you can use the fade out and fade in
03:01 - fade out
03:03 - and fade in
03:06 - and you can do a combination of the
03:08 - milliseconds and also i'm just going to
03:09 - put normal here
03:12 - for the amount of time
03:15 - so see it didn't slide at all just
03:17 - change the opacity another thing you can
03:20 - do is the toggle a toggle is just going
03:23 - to change the display based on the
03:25 - current visibility state so if it's
03:28 - currently hidden it will show the
03:30 - content if it's currently shown it will
03:32 - hide the content so we put toggle
03:35 - and this time i'm not going to pass in
03:37 - anything
03:38 - so if i toggle it it's just going to
03:42 - you can see really quick it went off
03:44 - and then came back on it came back on
03:46 - because of the fade in so toggle is just
03:49 - going to make it disappear if it's
03:50 - already appeared but you can also pass
03:52 - in speeds here so i'm going to pass in
03:54 - some milled seconds up at 700
03:56 - milliseconds let's see what happens now
04:00 - so it's going to hide
04:02 - and then fade in
04:04 - high so it's kind of weird that it's
04:06 - going up and then when you fade in it
04:08 - starts at full height and then
04:11 - the opacity goes 100
04:13 - but i can also put toggle here
04:18 - using toggle here is just like putting
04:20 - hide or show
04:22 - but it just does the opposite of
04:24 - whatever state it's currently in you can
04:26 - also do
04:27 - slide toggle or fade toggle so if it's
04:30 - slid down it will slide up if it's slid
04:33 - up it'll slide down or fade toggle if
04:35 - it's disappeared it will reappear if it
04:38 - is reappeared it will disappear
04:40 - okay now i want to talk about doing
04:42 - something after an animation completes
04:44 - so if we hide this element
04:46 - and then we're going to do a fade in
04:50 - so i'm going to fade in for a thousand
04:51 - milliseconds so
04:53 - nothing fancy here is just going to fade
04:54 - in just like that and now we're going to
04:56 - do a method chaining so if you do method
04:58 - chaining you can put in a lot of methods
05:00 - at the same time so i'm going to add a
05:02 - class
05:04 - blue
05:05 - now i'm going to quickly go up into the
05:07 - css here and for a class blue
05:10 - i'm going to change the background to
05:12 - blue
05:13 - and you'll see it's going to fade in and
05:15 - it's going to add the class blue so
05:16 - let's see what happens here
05:18 - and actually to make this
05:20 - more apparent i'm going to change the
05:22 - amount of time to 2000 milliseconds
05:27 - so you can see even though
05:30 - the fade in comes before the ag class
05:33 - they basically happen at the same time
05:35 - so this starts to fade in and then adds
05:37 - the class right away before the fade in
05:39 - is even done if you want to defer an
05:41 - action until after an animation has run
05:43 - to completion you need to use an
05:45 - animation callback function
05:47 - so
05:48 - you can put a callback function as the
05:50 - second argument passed any of the
05:52 - animation methods let me give you an
05:54 - example after the milliseconds i'm going
05:56 - to put a comma and now i'm going to put
05:58 - in the callback function
06:01 - let's see
06:05 - okay so now um we have this selector as
06:08 - this and this is just going to apply to
06:11 - what we're doing the animation on which
06:13 - is the h1 and now we're going to add the
06:15 - class blue so let's see what happens now
06:17 - run that
06:19 - so it fades in
06:20 - and then the background turns blue
06:23 - now one thing you can do is stop an
06:26 - animation so what i'm going to do here
06:32 - i'm going to attach a click event to the
06:35 - image the free code camp image and then
06:38 - in the function we're going to stop the
06:40 - animations
06:43 - we select the image tags and the on
06:45 - click will run this function where we
06:47 - select the h1 tag and do dot stop it's
06:50 - gonna stop the animation happening on
06:52 - the image so i'm gonna run this and
06:53 - while it's fading in i'm gonna press the
06:55 - image i just click the image and you can
06:57 - see it's slightly faded right now and it
07:00 - never add the class of blue
07:03 - so if i run
07:04 - this again you can see the full
07:05 - animation
07:08 - run it again and i'm going to click the
07:10 - image and it stops in the animation
07:12 - before it finishes it does not and it
07:14 - never gets the callback function so it
07:16 - never adds the class of blue the last
07:18 - thing i'm going to show in this video is
07:19 - the delay method so if you use delay
07:22 - it's going to introduce a delay between
07:24 - animations so let me show you an example
07:26 - of that
07:31 - so look at the paragraph at the bottom i
07:33 - know there's some other animations
07:34 - happening but when i run i get this
07:36 - again it's going to hide the paragraph
07:38 - for a half second and then it's going to
07:40 - delay for full seconds and then it's
07:42 - going to show for 0.3 seconds so those
07:45 - are the basics of javascript effects you
07:47 - can also do a few more custom effects
07:49 - with the dot animate method

Cleaned transcript:

in this video i'm going to talk about effects you can do in jquery we just have a few elements on the page i have an image an h1 tag and then a paragraph that you can see on the page there and i'm going to first talk about the hide event so we'll just type in the jquery selector and then we're just going to do a dot hide and that's it so if i run this code with just the image.hide it's going to hide the image the image just disappears you can see now it's like that image isn't even in the code there and if you need help adding jquery to your website you can check out my first video on jquery where i show you how to add jquery after you hide an element you can show the element so i just have to select it again and then just do dot show and now you're barely even going to be able to tell anything because it's going to hide it and then show it right away so hide and show just hides and show instantly but you can use animation in a couple of ways so you can pass in arguments to hide and show so it won't do it instantly i can pass in slow to make it a slow effect or fast to make a fast effect you can also use normal so let's see what that looks like see it disappeared slowly and then it came back quickly so instead of putting words slow and fast you can also put the number of milliseconds so i'm going to put 500 milliseconds to hide it that's a half a second and then 1 500 milliseconds to show at 1.5 seconds so let's see what that looks like okay so you can really do any speed you want by just passing in a number like that and let's just see what that looks like if i do it on the h1 tag so here i'm going to change this to h1 and let's try that so you can see it looks actually kind of different on the h1 so the show and hide effect use a combination of slide and fade effects with the the slide effect it's actually just changing the height really quickly so it's lowering the height and to zero and with an image when you lower the height it also automatically
