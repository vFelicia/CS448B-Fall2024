With timestamps:

00:09 - hey everybody it's
00:12 - Jesse and uh thanks for uh joining me
00:16 - today uh so I'm going to do something a
00:20 - little bit different so normally I work
00:22 - on a project uh that I'm I'm doing for
00:26 - work so but today I'm going to
00:28 - contribute to someone else's project
00:31 - so if you watch yesterday uh then you
00:34 - you'll know what I'm talking about if
00:35 - you didn't watch I'll kind of explain
00:38 - how I got to this point uh so yesterday
00:41 - I was trying to set up click tracking
00:43 - for Google
00:45 - analytics and I was already using
00:48 - something called uh react GA so it was
00:52 - uh
00:52 - in npm uh module that made it easier for
00:58 - you to use Google analytics and re
01:00 - react but when I finally got it I had
01:04 - some other unrelated problems during
01:06 - yesterday's stream but when I finally
01:07 - got it
01:09 - working and I went to click the link I
01:11 - wanted it to open in a new tab but it
01:15 - was blocked the browser treated it as a
01:17 - popup and blocked it by default so
01:21 - that's not what I wanted so I had to end
01:24 - the stream right when uh I found that
01:28 - error or I should say
01:30 - uh you all in the live chat found the
01:32 - error as well I think before me uh
01:36 - but I didn't have time to fix it right
01:39 - then during the stream so later on after
01:41 - I had a really really long meeting I
01:44 - found the answer and um or I at least
01:47 - got on the right track to the answer and
01:49 - so what I did is I made a
01:52 - component uh to use that was kind of
01:56 - like a
01:57 - wrapper around what react GA was already
02:01 - providing and now it works so I'll show
02:04 - you the
02:05 - component first and then I'm going to
02:07 - take you through the process the whole
02:09 - process of forking the react G
02:12 - repository uh making the changes and
02:15 - then submitting a pool request so I have
02:18 - no idea if the pool request will get uh
02:20 - merged in or not
02:22 - but but this this does work I tested it
02:26 - out so uh
02:28 - hopefully we can get everything merged
02:30 - in so I thought I had this up I guess I
02:32 - don't but here's the component okay so I
02:35 - will say the idea for this I I got from
02:40 - an issue that was
02:42 - already open so there are several issues
02:45 - open about this I think I found three of
02:48 - them uh that were all about the same
02:51 - issue
02:53 - so I'm going to I'm actually going to
02:56 - show you just so that you could see
03:01 - kind of the difference here
03:03 - so a
03:05 - Acom in April uh was able to do
03:09 - this and this ended up working okay it
03:12 - worked for for Acom it worked for this
03:15 - guy and it worked for
03:17 - me and uh I guess some other people too
03:20 - because it got four thumbs up one of
03:21 - those is my thumbs up so he did this I
03:24 - copied this and tried to use it and it
03:28 - didn't work now I'm sure it was probably
03:30 - something I was doing that it didn't
03:32 - work because it worked for these other
03:34 - people so I probably somehow messed it
03:36 - up but what I did then to get it to work
03:40 - for me was
03:41 - I I kind of combined what was done in
03:46 - another component so the layout
03:49 - component that I had have and um this
03:54 - this was brought in from a uh pool
03:56 - request and I can't remember who exactly
03:58 - did this this P I submitted the pull
04:01 - request for this one but uh I I thought
04:04 - you know what this layout component is
04:06 - doing a similar thing in terms of you
04:09 - know what it's bringing in and what it's
04:11 - outputting as to what I want to do so I
04:13 - basically took the structure of this
04:14 - layout
04:16 - component
04:18 - and I combined it with what was going
04:23 - on basically in in this part here and I
04:28 - made a new component
04:30 - uh so the combination of those two
04:33 - components works and this is what it
04:35 - does basically is I as an input it takes
04:40 - in a two which is basically your atref
04:44 - that You' normally put on a link it
04:45 - takes a label this is what's going to
04:47 - show up in Google analytics uh and then
04:50 - it takes you know whatever other props
04:52 - you put on there so like your title tag
04:54 - you normally put on a link or any
04:56 - classes that you want to put on there
04:58 - and that all gets in in here right so
05:01 - what gets outputed then is a regular
05:05 - link with all your props your href which
05:09 - is the value for two it says Target
05:13 - blank all by
05:15 - default and then it has this click
05:18 - Handler so on click it runs this and
05:21 - this is what's going to
05:24 - log the event as a click and send it to
05:29 - Google
05:30 - analytics okay so when done like this it
05:33 - behaves
05:36 - properly and it it opens it in another
05:39 - window and I'll show
05:41 - you just just to give you some proof
05:43 - that it's actually working
05:47 - so I push
05:50 - this to the reposit or to the live site
05:54 - and I click it and there it opens in
05:56 - another
05:58 - window and and I'm not going to go
06:01 - through showing it in Google analytics
06:02 - but it does show up in Google analytics
06:05 - and we'll inspect it I'll just just want
06:08 - to show you what it looks like
06:11 - here if you can't already
06:15 - guess you see what gets oops too big
06:19 - what gets put out here is an a tag looks
06:23 - like a normal a tag with the exception
06:24 - of this you know react ID but I mean
06:27 - that's normal for react uh
06:31 - so that's the the change that I want to
06:34 - submit basically I'm going to submit a
06:36 - new component that's going to be just
06:39 - for the situation where someone wants to
06:41 - track an outbound link and they want
06:43 - that link to open in a new
06:47 - window and so that's it's it's going to
06:51 - be pretty straightforward in in terms of
06:53 - a a pull request I'm not going to
06:55 - actually even change anything that's
06:57 - already there I'm just going to add one
06:59 - extra component so we shouldn't have any
07:02 - conflicts or anything like that so uh
07:05 - it'll be if if the maintainers of that
07:07 - repository want to bring it in it should
07:10 - be pretty easy for them to bring it in I
07:12 - know there's there's some style
07:14 - differences I noticed between what I did
07:16 - here and what they're doing so aside
07:19 - from that we can probably use this as is
07:22 - the only difference is I think I'm going
07:23 - to change the name I just used the name
07:26 - from uh that issue and uh but I'm going
07:29 - to change the name to make it more
07:31 - obvious that this is just for links that
07:34 - you want to open in a new window all
07:37 - right so since I've given the
07:40 - introduction here I'm going to check out
07:42 - the live chat and uh see who's here and
07:44 - who's saying
07:46 - hi um hey everyone a lot of people
07:50 - saying I okay so someone asked PR is a
07:52 - pool request so we had uh that's been
07:56 - explained in the live chat yeah so I
07:58 - didn't want the title to be really
07:59 - really long so I did abbreviate PR if
08:02 - you're not familiar with that that's
08:03 - pool request and that's what you it's
08:06 - called when you submit uh a change to
08:09 - someone's uh project on
08:14 - GitHub all
08:18 - right uh La Xavier says I'm going to
08:21 - watch this later at higher speed man
08:23 - sounds too bored for
08:26 - me do I really sound bored
08:33 - uh actually I think I do sometimes I I
08:35 - don't usually listen to my videos but
08:37 - occasionally I do and I do think I sound
08:40 - bored sometimes so I actually try to
08:42 - like have caffeine and stuff beforehand
08:45 - so that I'm a little bit more awake but
08:50 - um I don't know I'm normally kind of
08:52 - really laid back so it's hard
08:55 - to it's hard to put on the ACT that I'm
08:58 - upbeat but I'll I'll do my
09:02 - best
09:13 - um okay so I think
09:18 - um I think I've gotten through
09:20 - everything in the live
09:24 - chat all right well actually there's one
09:27 - question is free code cam good enough to
09:28 - help me change my field uh so har me
09:31 - asked that um free code Camp's a good
09:34 - start and I know people that have done
09:36 - free code camp and then gotten jobs so
09:39 - if you want to be a web developer free
09:42 - code Camp is really good for that if you
09:44 - want to go into anything
09:47 - else uh in in the field you know if you
09:50 - want to
09:51 - develop I don't know like desktop apps I
09:54 - mean with I realize that you can use
09:57 - things other things like electron or
09:59 - react native to develop uh desktop and
10:03 - and uh mobile apps but basically it kind
10:06 - of depends on what you want to
10:09 - do uh
10:12 - but you could I would supplement it
10:15 - though I mean it's always good to
10:16 - supplement depending on what particular
10:19 - project you're working on at the time so
10:22 - if anyone else has any advice for har
10:24 - meat about uh whether or not free code
10:27 - Camp is good enough to get the the
10:29 - learning he needs to change his field uh
10:31 - go ahead and put it in the live chat or
10:33 - in the comments to the video later on uh
10:35 - I personally have used a lot of other
10:37 - resources but it might be helpful if
10:39 - somebody if you've mainly used free code
10:41 - camp and been able to get a job with
10:43 - that then you're probably the person
10:46 - that harate uh needs to talk
10:51 - to all right here's another question
10:53 - about pool requests from Zeal so I'm
10:56 - going to answer this because this really
10:59 - does it's pertinent to the topic today
11:02 - it says why is it referred to as a pull
11:04 - request when you are pushing up
11:07 - to fb's
11:10 - repo I don't know what FB is but uh is
11:13 - it because the repo owner is pulling
11:15 - your code yeah basically uh is you're
11:19 - requesting that the owner of the repo
11:21 - pull your code in yeah so it's it's from
11:24 - the perspective of the repo owner so
11:26 - from your perspective you're pushing
11:28 - code right but from the repo owner
11:30 - perspective they're pulling it so you're
11:32 - asking them requesting that they pull
11:35 - the code
11:42 - in oh okay Z said FB was Facebook yeah
11:45 - so I'm actually uh let me show you the
11:47 - repo I've linked to it in the
11:49 - description as well so here's the repo
11:51 - that I'm going to be pushing through uh
11:53 - and this is what we worked with
11:55 - yesterday as well
11:57 - so this this is not as far as I know
12:00 - this is not from Facebook I mean I
12:03 - potentially could be mistaken I think
12:04 - it's uh unrelated to the official you
12:08 - know react project from
12:10 - Facebook let me see the contributors
12:19 - are yeah I don't know I'm not
12:23 - seeing I don't see anybody in here that
12:25 - I usually
12:27 - see
12:29 - with uh with Facebook's official react
12:33 - stuff so um yeah so I don't know I think
12:36 - this is an unrelated uh
12:42 - repository so anyway let's get to it
12:47 - um first thing we're going to do is
12:50 - we're going to Fork the
12:52 - repo so I'm going to Fork it
12:57 - to my account
13:02 - while I'm waiting for this I'll let you
13:03 - know I did start that react uh course
13:06 - that I was talking to you all about
13:07 - yesterday the uh Udacity Nano degree uh
13:11 - for react so I started it I it went
13:16 - through it only started for me an hour
13:18 - an hour ago uh
13:21 - so I only did a little bit just to check
13:23 - it out so far it's cool it was all just
13:25 - introductory stuff but hopefully it ends
13:27 - up being a good course
13:29 - I'll give if you're interested I'll give
13:31 - some updates and then maybe you you all
13:34 - can decide whether or not it's worth it
13:36 - I've maybe one of you would like to take
13:38 - it as
13:39 - well okay so now we have a fork so you
13:41 - can see this is my GitHub uh account but
13:46 - then I have this okay so I mean this is
13:48 - basic stuff but if there's anyone
13:49 - watching that's not really familiar with
13:51 - Git or GitHub then I'm going to kind of
13:52 - go over each step so if you're really
13:55 - Advanced with with Git uh and GitHub
13:59 - then this might be a little bit basic uh
14:02 - at least at first for you uh might not
14:05 - be that exciting but I don't want to
14:06 - leave anybody behind so I'm going to try
14:08 - to be as detailed as I
14:10 - can okay
14:14 - so now we want
14:16 - to clone this
14:21 - repo so I'm going to copy this I'm going
14:24 - to bring over my
14:27 - terminal cuz that's what we're going to
14:28 - work in it
14:31 - first all right so let
14:34 - me open
14:37 - up let's make this
14:41 - bigger
14:43 - and we need to go
14:47 - into projects so I I keep
14:51 - everything everything I'm working on
14:53 - mostly is in my projects folder so you
14:57 - can see there's all all this stuff in
14:59 - here so once I'm in the projects folder
15:01 - I can type in get
15:03 - clone and then I'll paste that
15:05 - in uh since I have SSH key set up this
15:08 - will work otherwise you can use the uh
15:11 - https so you can click that use the
15:15 - https I think you need if you do it that
15:18 - way I think you need a password I
15:21 - haven't done it that way in so long I
15:22 - can't remember but um that's what you
15:25 - would use if you didn't have your keys
15:27 - set up already
15:29 - all right so let's clone that must be
15:32 - pretty small that was that was super
15:35 - fast so now if we check out our folders
15:37 - now we have react
15:40 - GA so let's go into
15:46 - it and you can
15:48 - see we
15:51 - have when for at least for my terminal I
15:53 - have it set so when I'm in a folder
15:55 - that's a get repository it shows me what
15:57 - branch I'm on SO
15:59 - we're in the master Branch I think
16:01 - that's the only Branch I'm going to
16:02 - check
16:04 - though yep Master Branch the only Branch
16:07 - what we want to do is make another
16:09 - Branch normally uh correct me if I'm
16:12 - wrong I don't have a ton of experience
16:13 - with this but normally you don't want to
16:17 - push changes on a master Branch right
16:20 - you want to create another branch and
16:23 - then submit that is your pool
16:27 - request
16:30 - um I just saw there's some activity in
16:33 - the live chat I'm just going to check
16:34 - back really
16:36 - quick I want try to keep up with the
16:38 - live chat today since yesterday I ran
16:39 - out of time and I didn't get to
16:41 - everyone's questions and I I really feel
16:43 - bad about that uh
16:46 - because I I like to be able to address
16:48 - you know all the
16:56 - questions okay uh um Zan Zan
17:02 - Zano is asking about the react course
17:04 - said $400 or something right the react
17:07 - Nano degree uh yeah I think it was
17:10 - 500 so it's not
17:12 - cheap uh I think as I said yesterday I
17:16 - I've said in the past before like I've I
17:18 - have never spent more than $30 like
17:20 - total in the last however many years
17:23 - I've been doing this on educational
17:25 - stuff for you know for learning how to
17:28 - be a
17:29 - developer um because there's so many
17:32 - great free resources but I really want
17:36 - to get better with react there's a lot
17:37 - of projects that I know I'm going to be
17:40 - working on coming up within the next
17:42 - year that I'm going to use react for so
17:45 - I decided like I'm just going to go for
17:47 - it and then the fact that I spent $500
17:50 - on it is going to keep
17:53 - me it's going to get make me more
17:55 - dedicated I guess right so uh whenever I
17:59 - feel like oh I'm just I'm not I'm not
18:01 - going to do the work I'm going to put it
18:02 - off I'm too busy I'll think in the back
18:04 - of my mind like dude you spent $500 on
18:07 - this you better better not waste it so
18:10 - it's kind of like motivation for
18:17 - me all
18:19 - right so let's go back back to here so
18:22 - we're going to make a branch get
18:26 - branch and
18:31 - trying to think what I should name the
18:32 - branch
18:39 - um I'm going to say fix
18:43 - outbound fix outbound
18:46 - link does that sound all right if
18:49 - anybody thinks for some reason that the
18:51 - name for that branch is not good at all
18:54 - let me know I can just make a new Branch
18:57 - uh but I think that
18:59 - basically explains it uh so now I'm
19:03 - going
19:04 - to open this and
19:10 - Adam and this is totally unrehearsed so
19:13 - if you've watched before you know that
19:15 - it's un rehearsed because I mess up
19:16 - quite a bit uh but if I rehearsed it
19:19 - beforehand and I still messed up this
19:20 - much that would be kind of sad uh but if
19:23 - you're just watching for the first time
19:24 - this is all unrehearsed so um so this is
19:28 - the first time I'm I'm looking through
19:30 - this code I checked that a little bit on
19:32 - GitHub
19:33 - but uh basically we're going to be
19:36 - working I guess in this
19:38 - folder um test
19:43 - component yeah the only thing I'm I'm
19:46 - not sure about is what the test folder
19:50 - is because I'm no good I don't know what
19:53 - they're using for
19:57 - testing
20:01 - this might be the biggest problem here
20:04 - is writing
20:09 - tests
20:11 - so oh we'll see if anybody is recognizes
20:16 - what's going on here and uh can help me
20:19 - out I would appreciate
20:21 - that but otherwise let's just go to it
20:24 - let's make our component our new
20:25 - component and uh we got to figure out
20:27 - what to call call
20:29 - it so
20:34 - maybe it's definitely it's it's an
20:39 - outbound it's outbound
20:44 - link but we're opening it in new window
20:47 - I kind of want to call this component
20:48 - outbound Link new
20:51 - window I think that's too long but I
20:54 - don't know I've
20:56 - actually I remember reading something or
20:58 - seeing a video somewhere where some of
21:00 - the component names that were used uh
21:04 - for Facebook for building Facebook
21:06 - actually really long so I guess it's not
21:07 - terrible to do that uh so let's do that
21:11 - we'll call it outbound Link new new
21:17 - window so where's my sorry I got find my
21:20 - my terminal
21:22 - here
21:25 - um touch
21:30 - component oh no
21:34 - Source
21:35 - component and I'm going to call this
21:40 - outbound want to make sure yeah they are
21:43 - capitalizing
21:48 - that outbound Link new
21:55 - window
21:57 - Js
21:59 - Okay cool so now we've made
22:02 - that let's go in here I can get rid of
22:05 - these welcome
22:06 - screens uh I am going to
22:10 - take my
22:12 - code from here that I showed you a few
22:15 - minutes ago I'm going to pull it onto my
22:16 - other screen so that I can just pull
22:20 - pull the code
22:22 - over so first thing I'm going to do is
22:24 - just I guess I can copy and paste all of
22:26 - it cuz we're not really changing much
22:31 - so I don't know if I really ought to
22:34 - leave this in or not but I'll leave that
22:36 - up to the maintainers of the repo so
22:39 - that I just always like to uh give
22:42 - credit to where I get the ideas from
22:47 - so what all we need to
22:50 - change
22:52 - is I believe this name here right I
22:57 - think that's the only place place for
22:58 - using it yeah so that's it outlink new
23:05 - window out Link new window okay great so
23:09 - that's it that's all we need to change
23:11 - I'm going to save
23:12 - that
23:13 - [Music]
23:16 - and now
23:18 - let's go back and commit this
23:26 - change yep all right so
23:29 - add just going to add
23:33 - that and our k s is going to be
23:56 - add here we
23:59 - go all right so now we need to push this
24:01 - so we're going to go get
24:04 - push
24:06 - origin and what do we call
24:08 - this oh no did I I made the change on
24:13 - Master I'm going to look at the live
24:15 - chat and I'm sure you all have already
24:16 - caught that and uh
24:20 - have yeah you guys caught
24:26 - me
24:31 - oh man how long ago wow yeah it was like
24:34 - five minutes ago at least you all caught
24:35 - me all right
24:38 - so
24:45 - Shoot actually I'm gonna before I mess
24:48 - it up further I'm going to ask there's
24:50 - either two two things I could do one
24:52 - could
24:55 - I I haven't committed this change yet
24:58 - can I just remove what I added and not
25:01 - committed at all uh would that be the
25:03 - best way to do it or um does it even
25:07 - matter what I do to master when I go to
25:09 - submit the pool request I can just
25:11 - submit the one branch
25:20 - right like I could just do this go ahead
25:23 - with my commit copy it over to the other
25:26 - branch and
25:30 - then only submit that Branch
25:40 - correct let me uh let me
25:49 - see if I were
25:56 - to
26:06 - okay so um for everyone watching this
26:09 - later on I was just waiting for
26:10 - responses in the live chat here uh so
26:14 - create the branch from there but before
26:16 - just delete the old one okay so
26:21 - um yeah so I'll just commit these
26:23 - changes create a new Branch delete the
26:25 - Old Branch or flip that order but
26:28 - basically yeah that's what I'm gonna do
26:35 - okay oh wait and I did for some reason I
26:38 - thought I didn't actually commit it yet
26:39 - but I I did so sorry I'm sure you all
26:42 - were thinking like that I was crazy but
26:45 - all right
26:48 - so actually what what's the command for
26:51 - delete
26:56 - Branch it's just D I can I can do just
26:59 - SD okay cool I haven't had to delete a
27:03 - branch in so long I don't even
27:05 - remember uh
27:10 - get uh what did we call that one
27:13 - fix okay
27:19 - now just make a new
27:21 - Branch
27:26 - cool
27:29 - just to double check all right we switch
27:31 - there all this is on the branch okay
27:32 - we're good all right so now let's push
27:40 - that get
27:43 - push
27:46 - origin fix I found
27:52 - like Okay cool so now if we look at our
27:57 - repo so we should have another
28:01 - Branch cool so we have this branch
28:07 - and
28:10 - actually let me
28:13 - um let me pull
28:21 - up let me pull up github's instructions
28:24 - for submitting a pool request
28:29 - because I do want to show you the right
28:32 - way to do this so in instead of me
28:34 - fumbling around with it I
28:37 - mean it's not that hard you could
28:39 - probably figure it out but let's just do
28:42 - it the uh the way
28:45 - described in the GitHub help pages
28:49 - so all right so
28:52 - let's go to the original
28:56 - Repository
29:00 - we're going to go to new pool
29:05 - request I'm going to make this a little
29:07 - bit bigger for youall especially if
29:09 - someone's on like a low red screen or a
29:12 - small screen might be hard so we went
29:15 - back to the original repo react GA we're
29:17 - going to go new pull
29:23 - request
29:26 - and
29:30 - let's go compare changes so we have the
29:45 - base let's compare
29:50 - actually can
29:54 - also yeah we need to compare across
29:56 - Forks that that's what we need Okay
30:02 - so let's take what I
30:05 - did and we'll be able to fix out bound
30:09 - link and then we're going to compare it
30:11 - to the
30:15 - master
30:17 - right
30:23 - yeah oops is that should I switch this
30:29 - do I need a different order why is it
30:31 - telling me
30:42 - this okay I think possibly I just mixed
30:45 - up the order
30:47 - um correctly if I'm wrong in
30:52 - the uh in the live
30:56 - chat
30:58 - Master that's what we
31:00 - need now let's
31:04 - compare there we go that's it okay
31:12 - so oh you know what I totally forgot the
31:15 - whole uh testing
31:20 - thing totally forgot that I just I'm
31:22 - going to check really quick and see if
31:24 - they say something in the documentation
31:26 - about
31:29 - see p
31:34 - request oh no that was just a link to
31:36 - the issues thought it would be a a link
31:40 - to the bottom it's possible that they
31:45 - have yeah they do
31:48 - okay I should have looked for this first
31:50 - oh
31:51 - well um all right so we need to test all
31:56 - right I have gold installed so that's
31:58 - not a problem need to run a
32:16 - test okay so the disc file should not be
32:19 - committed until the review has been
32:26 - merged
32:37 - okay all right
32:39 - so if you're following along in the repo
32:42 - we're down at the bottom here uh
32:45 - otherwise you can just check it out on
32:46 - your screen so these are just some
32:49 - instructions for how to do the test the
32:52 - only thing that's confusing me is it's
32:55 - saying not to submit
32:58 - not to commit the disc
33:00 - files okay that's that makes more sense
33:03 - I I guess I didn't read that carefully
33:06 - enough all right so we got to be careful
33:08 - not to commit the disc files but
33:11 - otherwise it seems like all we'll need
33:13 - to do at least at first here is
33:16 - basically just this
33:18 - part and we don't have to worry
33:21 - about complete code yeah we don't have
33:24 - to worry about anything basically past
33:26 - this
33:27 - because we need to wait to hear
33:33 - back okay that makes sense if
33:36 - I'm understanding this incorrectly let
33:38 - me know uh in the live chat but
33:42 - otherwise we'll just do the tests
33:44 - hopefully everything works out uh as I
33:47 - said before the style is is different
33:50 - so I'm not sure you know if they want it
33:53 - to be of a particular style then that
33:55 - might be an issue
34:01 - all right so let's
34:03 - see if I run npm test this should
34:07 - work because like I said I think I
34:09 - already have golp installed
34:12 - globally let's
34:13 - [Music]
34:18 - go oops I never
34:23 - ran mpm
34:25 - install
34:27 - all right
34:29 - so since this is live I can't go back
34:32 - and edit
34:34 - this but what I should have done is as
34:37 - soon as I pulled the repo down I should
34:39 - have done an mpm
34:41 - install
34:43 - so I don't think it'll matter much for
34:45 - what we did since we B we just
34:48 - completely added a new component so that
34:49 - should be
34:51 - fine uh I'll check out we'll check out
34:54 - the package Json just to make sure there
34:55 - wasn't some sort of like hook uh commit
34:58 - hook that would have done
35:01 - something but
35:04 - otherwise I think this will be all
35:15 - right yeah uh in the live chat
35:19 - um with a comment it's or or yarn
35:22 - install yeah normally I do use yarn I
35:25 - didn't want to use it for this project
35:29 - because uh it said use npm so I just
35:33 - decided to just go with what they were
35:35 - doing uh let's see errors
35:42 - errors
35:52 - H okay so it's saying possibly I don't
35:55 - have the latest version s of node and
35:58 - mpm
36:01 - installed well that's no
36:08 - good all right does it give a
36:11 - version it doesn't really give a version
36:13 - number I wish I wish there
36:16 - was maybe up here it'll
36:19 - say mpm version
36:23 - 2.2.0 all right well let's see what
36:25 - version
36:34 - no all right that's not the npm version
36:36 - that's the version of
36:38 - this
36:46 - H all
36:55 - right
36:59 - so what I'm running 7.3.0 and npm
37:08 - 4.1.2 so I guess I'm going to have to
37:10 - update so bonus for this video if you've
37:14 - never updated these things we're going
37:16 - to do
37:25 - it
37:28 - so let's actually I'm going to update uh
37:31 - npm first and then see if that works and
37:36 - then I won't have to update node as
37:46 - well
37:50 - so should be able to update
37:53 - npm like
37:55 - this
38:01 - npm
38:17 - St not sure how long this will take so
38:20 - while that's loading I'm going to catch
38:22 - up in the live
38:25 - chat all right still have a decent
38:27 - amount of
38:29 - viewers I hadn't looked at the analytics
38:31 - of this video in a while and I thought
38:33 - man I've messed up so many things uh
38:36 - everybody is going to be
38:39 - gone all right wow that was super fast
38:42 - let's
38:47 - see I'm just checking to make sure there
38:49 - wasn't anything
38:51 - weird looks like everything
38:55 - worked
38:57 - and so let
38:58 - me just run npm install again
39:03 - maybe maybe it'll work this
39:08 - time nope all right let's
39:15 - see whoa
39:25 - okay
39:55 - for
40:01 - all right I'm just trying to read
40:02 - through some of
40:08 - this let's make it
40:11 - bigger
40:13 - okay I'm going to make this
40:19 - bigger so you all can see since there's
40:21 - a lot of text
40:25 - here okay
40:27 - probably should update uh node anyway
40:30 - since I haven't updated it in a
40:48 - while it's looking
40:55 - like
41:03 - now I'm not so sure it's a problem with
41:05 - my versions I'm going to go back to the
41:07 - live chat see if anybody has some ideas
41:20 - here all right so there's a question
41:22 - here I'm just going to answer it so I
41:24 - don't forget later do I plan on doing
41:25 - any react native live coding yes I do I
41:28 - just need to get a project where I'm
41:31 - going to be using it first but hopefully
41:34 - I'll have an opportunity for
41:47 - that ahed
41:50 - asks uh are you a professional in this
41:52 - field um yes so
41:57 - I
41:58 - guess if by professional you define
42:01 - professional someone who gets paid to do
42:03 - a certain thing then yes I'm a
42:05 - professional if by professional you're
42:07 - implying like that I'm an expert then
42:10 - probably no but I have been doing this
42:15 - for like four four
42:17 - years or so uh
42:21 - full-time so I I am a front-end
42:24 - developer employed at a university
42:46 - Brian says good to know everyone has the
42:48 - same crappy problems no matter how
42:50 - advanced you are I don't know how
42:52 - advanced I am but yeah I haven't had a
42:55 - problem like this in a while I mean with
42:58 - if you don't count yesterday when the it
43:00 - things weren't updating right on the
43:01 - server
43:02 - and I didn't really fix it I just ran
43:05 - the same command again and it worked the
43:07 - second time uh so I'm going to check out
43:11 - it looks like we have uh node there's an
43:15 - issue already issue 489 for node so I'm
43:18 - going to look it up I'll just look it up
43:20 - on my other screen and pull it over if
43:22 - if we want to look at
43:25 - it
43:33 - aim high says I just got my first
43:35 - developer job starting on the 3rd of
43:37 - July awesome all right so yeah I
43:40 - remember was it probably two weeks ago
43:42 - or so uh you were in the live chat uh
43:45 - this is aim high in the live chat uh
43:48 - talking about looking for jobs and
43:50 - things and I I remember I had asked for
43:52 - for updates to keep us updated so thank
43:54 - you so much for keeping us updated ated
43:57 - uh that's that's really awesome I'm like
44:00 - I'm super happy for you uh so hopefully
44:02 - it goes all right and um you know if I
44:05 - don't know what your schedule will be
44:06 - it's your new job but if you can join in
44:08 - for some of the live chats uh that would
44:10 - be awesome and if you uh if you need any
44:13 - any help or advice with anything you
44:15 - know feel free
44:16 - to uh message me on Twitter um I'll uh
44:21 - I'll help with anything I
44:25 - can
44:38 - yeah a high says uh really excited but
44:40 - very nervous I understand the
44:42 - nervousness uh you'll get just the more
44:44 - you work um you you'll get over the
44:47 - nervousness but you'll have that at
44:49 - first but um you know just be confident
44:52 - be confident in your skills and uh just
44:54 - keep working on it and that's um it'll
44:58 - it'll be it'll be a I think it'll be
45:03 - great all right so let's see sorry I'm I
45:06 - got distracted from looking up this uh
45:08 - issue but it was big news uh so it's
45:11 - worth the distraction so what was that
45:13 - issue 489
45:24 - okay
45:31 - okay so I'll pull this over so everyone
45:34 - can
45:39 - see uh so
45:43 - this this is the issue
45:47 - so let me scroll down a
45:50 - bit see if this looks
45:54 - like
45:57 - this looks like what we're
46:11 - getting yeah it's not it doesn't look
46:14 - exactly like what we're getting but I
46:16 - think it's worth checking
46:24 - out
46:36 - oh okay
46:39 - well xcode select install all right wow
46:42 - this is back in 2014 let me let me
46:44 - scroll down because I suspect some of
46:48 - the really old answers may not
46:50 - work
46:54 - so
46:58 - this this one was only 28 days
47:18 - ago um I I just saw Amed asked in the
47:22 - live chat should I go for iOS instead of
47:26 - Android um I don't know I I don't
47:30 - develop uh apps for phones right now so
47:34 - I'm probably not the best person to ask
47:37 - but if if I were going to go into
47:40 - developing apps based on what I know
47:42 - right now I would learn react
47:45 - native
47:48 - and I would
47:52 - um that would probably make it easier to
47:54 - develop for both
47:57 - so that's I mean that's my opinion on
47:59 - there but I'm sure someone who uh
48:01 - actually develops apps uh would probably
48:05 - be able to give you a better answer so
48:06 - don't uh don't put a lot of trust in my
48:09 - answer there because I'm not I'm not
48:10 - knowledgeable about you know the job
48:12 - outlook and salaries for like iOS versus
48:16 - Android
48:19 - developers all right let's
48:24 - see
48:26 - all right cool I like this idea uh run
48:29 - npm install G npm latest uh node
48:34 - let's try
48:43 - that I'm going to try this because it
48:45 - looks really easy and if it works then
48:50 - great if not it doesn't look like this
48:53 - will break
48:54 - anything
49:07 - okay cool doing
49:12 - something uh Emerson asks what course is
49:15 - better computer science or information
49:18 - systems um again I I don't know that I
49:21 - could give you a great answer for this I
49:23 - think it part it does depend on what you
49:25 - want to
49:32 - um so sorry I was I wasn't laughing at
49:36 - your question Emerson I was laughing at
49:38 - another comment
49:40 - there so yeah it depends on what you
49:43 - want to do uh if you want probably like
49:46 - something that would just be more
49:48 - broadly applicable then I guess computer
49:51 - science would be better uh I was
49:54 - actually
49:57 - I think I was brief I briefly majored in
50:00 - computer information systems for like
50:03 - one semester when I was getting my
50:05 - undergrad uh and then I I changed and
50:08 - majored in something else uh in well an
50:11 - economics and finance because I could
50:14 - graduate faster like that so when I was
50:17 - in college I was just worried about
50:19 - getting out of college as fast as I
50:21 - could with a degree so don't really
50:24 - recommend it but it is the cheaper way
50:26 - to go uh CU if you can graduate early
50:28 - you don't have to pay for more school
50:30 - all right so let's try this
50:35 - again see if it works so actually so in
50:46 - the in the
50:49 - chat so uh basic so XD in the in the
50:53 - chat which I mean I know that that's
50:55 - that's not how you you're going to
50:56 - pronounce it but just to be able to say
50:58 - it in the live chat saying you had the
51:00 - same issue is is this
51:04 - you that had this issue here or that
51:07 - wrote this
51:08 - here I can't tell because you're you're
51:11 - um your picture on the live chat at
51:14 - least on my screen is like super tiny so
51:17 - let me try to zoom in and see I can't
51:19 - really tell but uh okay cool I thought
51:23 - cuz the hair looked the same so I could
51:25 - defitely make out the hair all
51:27 - right cool sorry I didn't pick up on
51:29 - that uh sooner but no did it happen
51:34 - again all right what just happened
51:44 - here okay here's what I'm going to do
51:46 - I'm going to keep working on this and
51:48 - I'm G to try to fix it and I'm going to
51:50 - keep the live chat going or the live
51:52 - stream going but in case you don't have
51:55 - time to stick around for uh to figure
51:58 - this
51:59 - out then I'm just going to show
52:04 - you where would I have the pool request
52:07 - I'm just going to show you basically
52:08 - what the next next step would be if you
52:10 - wanted to submit the pool request and
52:13 - where do I have over here okay so
52:16 - assuming that you got everything to work
52:18 - and you wanted to submit the request so
52:20 - we're comparing it to the the master
52:24 - branch of the original repo we have over
52:29 - here we have our branch that we did made
52:31 - the changes on
52:35 - and for our request you want to describe
52:40 - what's going on here so I would describe
52:42 - in as much detail as I could uh what's
52:46 - happening uh I could reference issues so
52:48 - in this case I'm probably going to
52:51 - reference um all the issues so that I
52:55 - think there were three issues I found
52:56 - that dealt with the same problem so I'd
52:58 - reference
53:00 - those and I might even mention that user
53:05 - that I got some of these ideas from uh I
53:08 - can't remember the name but I the user I
53:10 - I showed at the
53:11 - beginning and then you would create the
53:13 - pool
53:15 - request and that's pretty much it once
53:17 - you hit correct me if I'm wrong in the
53:19 - live chat but once you do that you hit
53:21 - create pool request then you just wait
53:24 - and see what the uh
53:26 - maintainers are going to say sometimes
53:28 - there are automated tests that happened
53:30 - so you might get immediate feedback if
53:32 - they have an automated test set up in
53:35 - that case like maybe you run it runs the
53:38 - test and it tells you you don't pass the
53:40 - test then maybe you could you know re
53:42 - try to fix it then and resubmit but
53:45 - basically that's it that would be the
53:47 - next step so if you were just here for
53:48 - that and you can't stick around then
53:51 - thank you for watching and uh join join
53:53 - me again sometime
53:55 - um otherwise we're going to try to fix
53:58 - this unrelated
54:01 - problem that just came up sometimes the
54:03 - unrelated problems are fun though uh to
54:05 - fix
54:07 - so let's pull this back on the
54:12 - screen and we'll pull this I'm going to
54:15 - kind of I want to read some of the other
54:17 - things
54:20 - that that happened just to
54:24 - see
54:26 - in
54:54 - myology
54:56 - okay this person said they had to
54:58 - downgrade node so maybe my node version
55:01 - is not out of date maybe it's too new
55:05 - see that I don't really know how
55:07 - to how I can
55:14 - tell this person restarted their
55:17 - computer and it
55:24 - worked
55:26 - wonder if the X
55:41 - Cod I guess I could try the uh the xcode
55:54 - thing
55:56 - oh Patrick says are you using MVM shoot
55:59 - I I don't remember it's been so long
56:02 - since I upgraded note I can't remember
56:03 - what I used to upgrade it last time but
56:06 - I think I did I either used NVM or one
56:09 - of the similar things that NVM does in
56:12 - case you're not familiar with
56:14 - NVM
56:16 - um it's uh B it's it's a way to manage
56:19 - your node versions upgrade versions and
56:22 - uh is it I think nvm's the one that you
56:25 - can have different versions running uh
56:28 - for different
56:49 - projects what's it so try that npm i g
56:54 - no all right let's
56:56 - try I just saw uh
57:02 - xd's comment to try
57:05 - this um mpm
57:12 - I worth a
57:17 - try okay well it did something it added
57:20 - and removed some packages
57:22 - so uh let's
57:26 - see how am I
57:31 - having all right so it is changing
57:33 - package
57:36 - Json kind of I didn't want I change to
57:39 - change package Json
57:41 - but oh
57:45 - well uh that's not what I wanted I
57:49 - wanted
57:51 - seeall run this again and see
58:05 - okay ahed is saying what's what's the
58:07 - speaker's
58:13 - name for uh let me try to go back
58:19 - up okay are you talking about the one
58:21 - that does the uh the math stuff so I
58:24 - know um for free code camps YouTube
58:35 - um if you're talking about the uh
58:39 - tutorial videos for a lot of JavaScript
58:41 - stuff uh B does those on free code camp
58:44 - we do have some other stuff oh okay he
58:46 - is talking about I couldn't figure out
58:47 - if you're talking about Bo or me I'm
58:49 - Jesse
58:53 - so yeah so I do I don't do a lot of
58:57 - tutorial stuff at least for free code
58:58 - Camp uh I am planning on doing some on
59:01 - my own channel but B already does such a
59:04 - great job with tutorials I can't compete
59:06 - with that uh but what I can do is
59:10 - um do some stuff live and sometimes make
59:13 - a fool of myself so that hopefully you
59:15 - all learn something and I get a lot from
59:17 - you all when when I'm working on
59:19 - projects so um so that's why this the
59:24 - show today is is kind of a mess we're
59:26 - having problems but that's the whole
59:27 - point is uh to work through like normal
59:30 - issues that come up as you're doing your
59:33 - your everyday
59:35 - work and did this
59:38 - work I wasn't looking I was looking at
59:41 - the live chat and I think this actually
59:42 - just
59:50 - worked oh okay it says can't find you
59:53 - with with at
59:56 - Jesse wait where are you trying to find
59:58 - me with with
60:03 - at sorry any amage uh in the live chat's
60:07 - asking uh can't find you with at symbol
60:10 - Jesse where I just want to where are you
60:12 - trying to find me at with
60:15 - that if it's in like within the live
60:20 - chat um I'm at free code Camp right
60:23 - now
60:25 - so I'm not I'm not logged in with my um
60:28 - with my account uh right now in the
60:31 - comments to the videos I use my account
60:33 - but in the chat I'm free code
60:42 - Camp all right so it looks like this
60:45 - worked which is awesome so what I'm
60:48 - going to do
60:52 - is I'm going to run the test hopefully
60:56 - that works better than than everything
60:59 - else so far I'm going to run the test
61:03 - and let me know if you think this is a
61:05 - good idea or not but I don't really want
61:09 - to commit the changes made to package
61:12 - Json so I'm not going to commit
61:17 - those I think that would be
61:20 - better cuz I'm I'm not trying to change
61:23 - something like that big to their project
61:25 - I just want my change to be that one
61:27 - thing added that one component so um so
61:31 - that's the plan let me know in the live
61:33 - chat
61:34 - if if you think I should do something
61:38 - else yeah so in case you missed it the
61:42 - command that actually fixed this I mean
61:45 - assuming the other commands I did before
61:46 - that didn't help which who knows I can't
61:49 - really tell at this point uh the command
61:51 - that actually fixed it was
61:55 - this one the one that I'm highlighting
61:58 - here npm
62:01 - i-g node uh dyen GP
62:06 - so that fixed
62:12 - it so if you're having a similar problem
62:15 - try
62:16 - that all right now we're going to run I
62:19 - don't I don't even remember what the
62:20 - command was now uh let's see
62:27 - scroll down npm test okay let's run npm
62:37 - test okay I'm only failing
62:40 - one not
62:43 - bad but
62:46 - actually actually um here's the thing I
62:51 - didn't write any tests for my component
62:53 - so
62:55 - of course I should be passing these
62:56 - tests I'm actually surprised that I
62:58 - failed one
62:59 - because I didn't do anything to this
63:04 - so why would it why would that be
63:08 - failing cannot find module
63:15 - Jon uh but at least I can see so what
63:18 - are they using
63:23 - mocha
63:25 - so are using mocha for
63:34 - testing all right so here's what I'm
63:37 - thinking I have two options here well I
63:43 - I'm going to like just for a second
63:45 - ignore the fact that it's actually
63:47 - failing a test and this is just this is
63:50 - not me that's failing the test I didn't
63:52 - change anything in that component so
63:56 - um so for some
63:59 - reason the master branch of this
64:01 - repository is actually failing a
64:04 - test so I don't know how I'm going to be
64:06 - able
64:07 - to uh submit this request without
64:10 - failing something but my other options
64:13 - are this I just submit it without
64:15 - writing tests for that new component
64:19 - or I try to learn mocha in like five
64:22 - minutes and and try to submit
64:26 - something your feedback is greatly
64:29 - appreciated on
64:31 - this I just here's what I'm I'm
64:35 - thinking I kind of just want to take a
64:38 - chance and submit this request without
64:40 - writing the test because it's such a
64:43 - simple pull
64:45 - request and uh the
64:48 - component is really
64:50 - small I don't know that I recommend
64:53 - doing that on projects I mean normally
64:55 - you want to follow everything but uh
64:58 - just because of the fact that I've never
65:00 - written tests for mocha
65:03 - before this is turning into a
65:06 - lot bigger of a a project than I really
65:09 - wanted it to
65:22 - be okay cool so Sebastian says just
65:25 - submit it you're making a new component
65:28 - uh not editing uh one so
65:34 - okay cool I still even if I submit it
65:37 - I'm still a little bit worried about
65:39 - that I'm going to fail just because of
65:41 - of this failing
65:53 - test
65:55 - actually want to check that component
65:58 - out in the test
66:23 - quickly
66:38 - yeah I can't the the odds of me actually
66:40 - writing good tests for this are so low
66:43 - at this point I'm not even like I'm like
66:45 - barely following these already written
66:48 - test
66:50 - so I think I'm just going to submit it
66:53 - and then see what the maintainers say
66:55 - maybe they'll give me some useful
66:56 - feedback and I can make some
67:01 - changes or maybe somebody else will see
67:03 - the pool request and somebody who's good
67:07 - with you know with mocha and and can
67:10 - write that but at the very least the
67:12 - pool request will be there it'll be
67:14 - visible to other people and it could be
67:15 - helpful to somebody else
67:22 - possibly so
67:28 - I don't even know if I should commit any
67:29 - of this stuff because we haven't
67:31 - actually changed anything except the
67:33 - package
67:44 - Json actually let me look I do want to
67:46 - look at this again to see what the
67:52 - build
67:57 - there we go go
68:03 - build I don't think the build really
68:05 - matters at this point because we're I'm
68:07 - not supposed to um commit stuff from D
68:12 - anyway so I'm just going to go ahead
68:15 - with the pull
68:21 - request and
68:26 - I'm going to check the live chat really
68:27 - quick to see what you all
68:35 - think van is is begging for uh
68:40 - subscribers so saying subscribe me
68:42 - please subscribe me
68:45 - please I'll check out your channel um
68:49 - and maybe I'll subscribe from my from my
68:51 - personal account I'm not going to sub
68:53 - subscribe from free code camp but uh
68:56 - I'll check it
69:00 - out all right James says tests are
69:22 - necessary
69:27 - uh James says earlier I think that if
69:29 - you feel that you need a test then it is
69:31 - valid to spend the
69:33 - time maybe they can help you with the
69:35 - error X XD says maybe they can help you
69:38 - with the
69:45 - error all right
69:52 - yeah
70:02 - uh Teemo says uh you could probably copy
70:06 - the tests from a different component and
70:07 - adapt them
70:10 - right yeah maybe I
70:16 - could it seems like I had some
70:18 - suggestion so
70:20 - basically based on what's in the live
70:23 - chat now I have some suggestions that
70:25 - say just just submit the request as is
70:28 - some saying write the test and some
70:32 - saying maybe like submit but ask for for
70:36 - help from the
70:38 - maintainers um let's see how long Okay
70:41 - since this stream has been going on for
70:43 - an hour and 10 minutes at this point
70:47 - what I'm going to do is
70:50 - submit
70:52 - and see what the maintainers say if they
70:56 - want to merge it then great we know
70:58 - Wonderful it'll get merged otherwise if
71:00 - they say I need the test then what I'll
71:03 - do
71:04 - is at some point maybe not tomorrow but
71:07 - at some point in you know the next week
71:09 - or two I'll do a live stream on test so
71:12 - I'll have to learn how to write the test
71:14 - before then but it's probably worthwhile
71:17 - for me to learn that anyway so what I'll
71:20 - do is if I need the test I'll learn how
71:23 - to do it and then I'll write them live
71:26 - on a stream that would be kind of cool
71:28 - to stream anyway I haven't I've never
71:30 - done a stream on on writing test
71:33 - so I think that's the plan does that
71:35 - sound like a good
71:52 - plan
71:58 - okay all right it seems like uh few few
72:02 - people in the live chat are saying that
72:04 - that sounds
72:07 - good all right cool so I think that's
72:10 - the plan I'm going to submit this now um
72:13 - I just need to
72:19 - type add component for tracking and
72:22 - outbound link and opening
72:24 - I don't I don't want window to be cut
72:26 - off I want this all to be on one line
72:28 - and opening in
72:31 - new see if this
72:33 - enough nice okay so that
72:37 - fits all right
72:40 - um I'll just describe a little bit so
72:44 - actually I need to find
72:47 - these let
72:49 - me go to these
72:52 - issues
72:54 - really quick
72:55 - so they were all like right on top so
72:59 - they it shouldn't be too hard to find
73:00 - these three
73:03 - issues all right so that was this one
73:05 - the outbound link one and
73:08 - then this one and I think this one also
73:11 - references another
73:22 - one so I think it was these
73:26 - three so we have
73:31 - 91
73:34 - 71 and
73:45 - 115
73:49 - shoes let's
73:52 - see
73:56 - all right that's good
73:57 - 115 if I just do hashtag nice uh what
74:01 - was this one what did I say 91 and 71 91
74:10 - okay 71 yep and
74:22 - 911
74:48 - all right I'm going to read this back I
74:50 - recommend reading back things that you
74:52 - write if you don't want to mess up so
74:55 - that helps me so uh in regard to issues
75:00 - whatever I created a component that
75:02 - successfully tracks a click on an
75:03 - outbound link and opens that link in a
75:06 - new window or tab all right that sounds
75:08 - good I'm just going to make a little bit
75:09 - a note about the testing uh just to let
75:13 - them know uh what what was going on
75:16 - there
75:22 - uh
75:52 - you
76:11 - I don't know how to write test and MoCA
76:13 - I didn't write any for this new
76:14 - component if this is necessary I'm
76:16 - willing to learn how to write them and
76:17 - submit another Quest all right so how's
76:21 - how's that look uh for everyone watching
76:23 - now I that's pretty straightforward is
76:26 - there anything any other information
76:27 - that probably should be in here or are
76:30 - we good maybe I should include the link
76:32 - to this
76:35 - video so for more information watch how
76:39 - we did
76:42 - this okay cool I see Teemo actually had
76:46 - said just that to mention the uh the
76:48 - test uh in the description so
76:51 - awesome James says you could use
76:54 - grammarly uh in instead of reading that
76:56 - out so yeah actually I've never used
76:58 - that before um but that's probably a
77:02 - good
77:09 - idea maybe I'll do us actually
77:14 - um all right Teo says looks good I
77:17 - actually I kind of do want to include
77:18 - the link to this video now that I think
77:20 - about it
77:22 - because
77:24 - um this might it may have some
77:27 - information that would be useful to the
77:30 - maintainers I mean potentially I don't
77:33 - know what do what do you think I got to
77:36 - see how to
77:38 - um I don't know if there'll be a link
77:41 - ready to use until this
77:47 - video I guess it would be the link would
77:50 - work I'm I'm assuming it's the same link
77:53 - when this video actually uh gets turned
77:56 - into like a recording after I finished
77:59 - it
78:00 - so I'll I'll do
78:06 - that let's
78:21 - see
78:35 - uh let's
78:38 - see actually they need
78:43 - to
78:48 - oops just want to make sure no it didn't
78:51 - work
78:59 - oh okay
79:14 - um actually maybe I should just keep the
79:17 - URL here
79:21 - um
79:23 - okay
79:25 - cool
79:33 - um all right that looks
79:35 - good I'm going to go ahead and uh allow
79:38 - edits for maintainers if you uncheck
79:40 - this box then the maintainers don't have
79:44 - access to edit uh to edit your stuff
79:47 - like you're part of the code uh and some
79:50 - cases maybe you don't want that but in
79:51 - this case I'm fine with with that like
79:53 - maybe they want to go in and write the
79:55 - test or something I I don't know uh but
79:58 - that's fine with me I just I mean I I
80:02 - this react GA has helped me in my
80:04 - project so I just think it'd be cool if
80:06 - I could help you know improve uh react
80:09 - GA just you know a bit and help them out
80:13 - and help everybody out that uses this so
80:16 - all right so I'm going to go ahead
80:18 - and submit
80:21 - this
80:24 - okay ahed did say uh please script the
80:26 - video they may not have time to go
80:27 - through the entire length
80:30 - yeah
80:33 - um yeah I've thought about doing this
80:35 - before I just there's so much some of
80:39 - the videos are really long so it is hard
80:41 - I would love to be able to go in
80:44 - and at least put like a little table
80:46 - contents in where people could skip to
80:48 - head to parts of the videos but I just
80:50 - haven't had time to do it uh that that's
80:52 - probably going to take a long time I
80:55 - mean I think I've
80:56 - done I've done almost 30 videos just for
80:59 - free code camp and I did live streams
81:01 - before that on my own channel so it's a
81:03 - lot of content to go through so I think
81:05 - it's a good idea I just don't have time
81:07 - right now to to do that also it's really
81:10 - weird to hear myself do these videos so
81:12 - I kind of don't like to watch my own
81:14 - videos but
81:17 - um at some point maybe uh you know I'll
81:21 - try to go back and do them
81:23 - maybe some of the videos that get the
81:25 - most traffic it would be worthwhile to
81:27 - do that
81:49 - for all right so now they do have an
81:52 - automated automated system for checking
81:55 - so no conflicts obviously we uh we
81:59 - anticipated that so we didn't change
82:02 - anything that was
82:21 - existing so I don't know how long this
82:23 - check will take it'd be cool to find out
82:26 - what happens while I'm still doing the
82:28 - stream so I'm going to go in at this
82:30 - point uh if if you're not if you haven't
82:32 - watched the show before at the end if I
82:34 - have time I try to go through all the uh
82:37 - live stream questions and answer all
82:38 - your questions so I'm going to go
82:40 - through quickly I have been keeping a
82:43 - pretty good track of what's going on in
82:45 - the live chat so hopefully I didn't miss
82:48 - too many things uh but I'm going to go
82:50 - through and do that so if you were just
82:52 - here for for the actual you know work
82:54 - part of this then uh thanks for watching
82:57 - and um please uh join join in again for
83:01 - another show if you can uh otherwise
83:04 - stick around if you have any questions
83:05 - go ahead and put them in the live chat
83:07 - now uh if you can't stick around for the
83:09 - answer put them in the comments or you
83:11 - can direct message me on Twitter the
83:13 - link to my Twitter account is in the
83:15 - description
83:21 - below
83:24 - actually it looks like I won't be able
83:26 - to get all the way back up to the top of
83:27 - the live chat so it only saves so many
83:29 - messages so it did cut off so sorry if
83:32 - if your message was like really up up
83:35 - high uh then I won't get to it usually
83:38 - that doesn't happen there's uh only a
83:41 - few times have I had that happen that
83:42 - there's so much going on in the live
83:44 - chat that it cuts off so I sorry for
83:48 - that I didn't anticipate that
83:50 - happening uh let's
83:54 - see uh ahed
83:57 - asked do you know any Android live
83:59 - streams actually I don't know any
84:02 - Android live streams so I'm sorry about
84:03 - that uh if anybody that's listen that's
84:07 - watching this later on knows of any
84:09 - Android live streams please put it in
84:11 - the uh in the comments and then maybe uh
84:14 - AED will see that at some
84:21 - point
84:27 - looks like there was a lot of uh good
84:29 - discussion in the live chat so I'm kind
84:31 - of just skipping through a lot of
84:51 - it
84:59 - um ahed ask do you think Android Java
85:02 - iOS are
85:04 - boring uh I don't really know if I'd say
85:06 - like
85:08 - boring for
85:11 - me I just don't know a lot about it uh I
85:15 - I have not that not really a lot of
85:17 - exposure uh to Java and pretty much none
85:20 - at all for developing for
85:23 - iOS uh I did actually once I did pay for
85:27 - and started a course on developing for
85:29 - iOS but I
85:31 - couldn't I couldn't get it to work
85:34 - basically the course wanted you to
85:37 - install some stuff to be I had a Windows
85:39 - computer at the time I didn't have a Mac
85:41 - so I couldn't get it to work so that I
85:42 - could develop it on my Windows computer
85:44 - and it came down to like my uh my CPU
85:47 - like only certain CPUs can handle that
85:49 - so anyway so I got a refund for the
85:51 - course
85:52 - but other than the very small exposure I
85:55 - had then I I don't really know so I
85:58 - can't really comment on it uh whether or
86:01 - not I think it's boring or not because I
86:02 - just haven't worked with it I once went
86:05 - to a class where we uh worked on a game
86:08 - in Java and um I mean it was it was
86:16 - fun uh J jine I'm not sure how to
86:20 - pronounce it it's j a h
86:22 - H uh EI n says why not use Homebrew to
86:26 - keep the stuff updated uh yeah Homebrew
86:30 - if you're on a Mac Homebrew uh is kind
86:32 - of like a package manager type of thing
86:34 - uh Homebrew is cool I I do have some
86:37 - stuff installed with
86:39 - Homebrew I kind of think that I didn't
86:42 - originally install node or anything with
86:44 - with Homebrew
86:46 - so that's why I'm not using it uh but
86:51 - normally yeah with with Homebrew uh it
86:53 - does make it a lot easier to keep things
87:21 - updated
87:44 - okay I see now XD had told me before I
87:47 - even asked he he told me the comment
87:49 - that was his from earlier in the show so
87:53 - uh on the uh on the issues so oh hey I
87:56 - just uh checked it looks like all checks
87:58 - have passed which I mean that was kind
88:01 - of expected uh since we didn't write any
88:03 - new tests so uh evidently the uh issue
88:08 - that we
88:09 - had with uh the code failing one of the
88:12 - tests maybe that was just something
88:15 - maybe the changes that we made in
88:18 - package Json caused that somehow
88:20 - so at least got through here so normally
88:24 - uh if a pull request doesn't pass the
88:26 - automated checks usually it's like
88:28 - rejected
88:29 - automatically uh so this is a good sign
88:32 - it passed these so some one of the
88:34 - maintainers will probably look at it at
88:35 - some point so now all we do is just wait
88:39 - I'll definitely update you all on what
88:41 - happens I mean you could you could check
88:44 - out the repo and everything too but uh
88:47 - so you don't have to keep track of it I
88:49 - will update you whenever I get any uh
88:52 - anything about it so cool I'm going to
88:56 - keep going through the live chat here
89:00 - and see I'm not talking a lot about it
89:03 - because I've already kind of gone
89:04 - through a lot of this stuff while we
89:07 - were while we're doing the
89:19 - video ahed said the moment you said it's
89:22 - going to take time the number abruptly
89:24 - fell to 55 from 67 so you still had the
89:27 - number of viewers
89:29 - so it looks like uh everybody Dro yeah
89:33 - at some point I think I told everybody
89:34 - like you can drop out now if you're not
89:36 - interested in this is just going to take
89:38 - a while and they so they did drop out
89:39 - which is cool I I
89:42 - understand sometimes these videos go
89:44 - really long and uh you know not you just
89:47 - don't have the time not everybody has
89:49 - the time to
89:50 - watch
90:20 - for
90:49 - okay I'm going through uh yeah it looks
90:52 - like I'm almost to the bottom of the uh
90:54 - live chat here so a lot of the stuff was
90:57 - just responses to things earlier that I
90:59 - already uh read out for the most
91:10 - part okay we had uh
91:13 - SJ s Ur r a j says you installed gulp
91:18 - globally uh yeah I did install it
91:20 - globally um um I to be honest I don't
91:23 - use gulp as much as I used to anyway but
91:26 - I think I already had it installed
91:29 - globally I think I did I'm not 100% sure
91:32 - so that's why I just did it globally uh
91:35 - again it's possible that I was mistaken
91:37 - I didn't have it installed globally to
91:39 - begin with but at one time I used gulp
91:41 - for pretty much every project so it made
91:43 - sense for me to install it
91:50 - globally
92:00 - um Ahmed asks are you on LinkedIn uh
92:04 - yeah I am on LinkedIn so if you just
92:06 - look up Jesse wle uh on LinkedIn I am I
92:11 - am there I think I have a link to it so
92:15 - in the description for this video I have
92:17 - a link to my YouTube channel and for my
92:20 - yoube channel YouTube Channel I have
92:23 - links uh to my other social
92:26 - media uh channels so I think the
92:28 - LinkedIn one is is in there uh if you
92:31 - find me on free code or on uh LinkedIn I
92:35 - don't know how many Jesse Wiles there
92:36 - are on LinkedIn but um it's j SS e we i
92:43 - g l so maybe there might be a bunch of
92:46 - them I'm the one that works at
92:47 - Franciscan
92:50 - University and I'm I'm a front-end
92:52 - developer I don't think there are any
92:53 - other Jesse Wiles that are front-end
92:55 - developers on LinkedIn right
93:06 - now uh wizzy 17 asks what language are
93:10 - you using to code um just this is mainly
93:14 - JavaScript but it's it's react uh
93:18 - so it might be it might look a little
93:21 - little bit
93:22 - different uh especially the HTML portion
93:25 - of it but it's basically just
93:43 - JavaScript Okay add a request to show
93:46 - the
93:49 - um show the D I guess that's it I guess
93:53 - just one one check uh it wanted to show
93:56 - the details but I
93:58 - don't unless there's oh yeah details
94:00 - there we go I don't know why I didn't
94:02 - see
94:05 - that all right so let's check out
94:10 - details I'm not sure um s SJ what's your
94:15 - um what you were looking for but uh I
94:19 - mean you could check this out too
94:23 - but it looks
94:25 - like yeah actually I want to
94:27 - see yeah everything passed so we didn't
94:30 - that failing thing uh in outbound
94:34 - link didn't come up again
94:39 - so okay
94:50 - cool
94:52 - uh Ahmed
94:54 - says mobile devices and apps are the new
94:57 - era uh mintra from India shut down their
95:01 - website and continued business only
95:03 - using a mobile app that's cool that's I
95:06 - mean that's interesting I I don't think
95:09 - the web is going anywhere uh right now
95:12 - because it's huge I mean who knows
95:16 - like in time maybe uh but so I mean at
95:21 - least at this point the web is here like
95:24 - it's it's it's pretty steady but I mean
95:26 - who knows things change so it's hard to
95:29 - predict what's going to happen in the
95:30 - future I've also heard people say that
95:32 - apps are going to not be a thing anymore
95:34 - because people just make Progressive web
95:37 - apps that run just as well uh on you
95:41 - know in a browser or on a phone
95:43 - everything so maybe that'll be a thing
95:45 - at some point I mean it already is a
95:48 - thing now but maybe it'll be a reality
95:49 - to where those apps can actually run
95:52 - just as well so I don't know what's
95:54 - going to happen
95:56 - but uh for now I think well as I said
96:00 - said before if if you're trying to
96:02 - choose between web development or
96:04 - developing for apps or anything I would
96:06 - learn react learn react native and then
96:10 - uh you can develop for lots of different
96:14 - things and not have to learn quite as
96:17 - much uh as if you wanted to develop for
96:20 - all those things but wanted to do it you
96:22 - know in Swift and in Java and in um you
96:26 - know in JavaScript or or whatever other
96:29 - even backend languages you would need to
96:31 - know so that's that's my opinion on it
96:34 - I'm not saying it's there there probably
96:36 - other opinions that have good points as
96:45 - well James says I have a game we built
96:49 - in uh seore or C++ it's been a long time
96:53 - it was a nuclear war game that sounds
96:57 - cool I'd like I'd love to build more
96:59 - games in like JavaScript and stuff if I
97:01 - had time I think that it would just be
97:03 - fun and my kids would probably like it
97:05 - it it would help my kids to be more
97:08 - interested in what I
97:20 - do
97:23 - uh XD says you can do apps using react
97:27 - native Ahmed says good suggestion would
97:29 - you help me for this all right cool so
97:32 - XT is actually coding react native
97:35 - now yeah I'm not doing react native yet
97:38 - but like I mentioned before uh at the
97:40 - very beginning so if if you weren't here
97:41 - for the beginning you might have missed
97:43 - it I just signed up and just started
97:45 - today the react course the new react
97:48 - nanodegree course from Udacity and part
97:52 - of that at the end of the course I will
97:54 - be making an app with react native
97:57 - that's that according to the course
98:00 - description it will run on Android and
98:01 - iOS so when I get to that point I will
98:04 - be able to provide help but at this
98:05 - point I probably won't be very helpful
98:07 - for
98:15 - that uh Ahmed says they want to connect
98:18 - on on LinkedIn too yeah if anybody if
98:21 - anybody wants to connect with me on any
98:23 - of the social media channels like I'm
98:25 - I'm cool with that I'll I'll friend you
98:27 - or add you or whatever
98:30 - um you know if if you prefer one channel
98:33 - over another I'm I'm cool with that I'm
98:35 - on everything I'm not really active on
98:37 - everything
98:39 - but um but I'll keep up with like direct
98:42 - messages and things like
98:50 - that
98:59 - now Ahmed said I I was never trying to
99:01 - be rude by talking about the Mobile area
99:03 - during great job yeah Ahmed I I didn't
99:05 - take it uh as being rude so I mean it's
99:08 - totally cool yeah in in general like I
99:11 - don't really get upset with anything
99:12 - anybody says in this chat I mean even I
99:15 - at one point early on I had somebody in
99:17 - here like getting really angry that I
99:20 - was using J query so but I'm cool with
99:24 - it I'm I'm cool with I actually I always
99:26 - expect way more criticism than I really
99:29 - get everybody's been really positive and
99:31 - I know like I know that there are people
99:34 - that are way better than me and I do
99:35 - make a lot of mistakes so uh you all are
99:39 - way nicer than I probably deserve so
99:42 - don't don't feel bad if you have some
99:43 - harsh criticism for me I mean it's
99:46 - always cool if you can say it nicely but
99:48 - even if you can't like I'm I'm okay with
99:59 - that uh wizzy says I'm new in learning
100:02 - to code and I started with python what
100:05 - do you guys think I should learn next uh
100:08 - wizzy it just depends on what you want
100:09 - to do
100:11 - um if you want to do web stuff then you
100:15 - you'll need to learn
100:17 - JavaScript um if you want to do like I
100:21 - don't know like machine learning stuff
100:24 - then from what I understand python is
100:26 - okay uh or like big data like you could
100:29 - probably stick with python and just get
100:31 - deeper into that so uh it's really up to
100:34 - what you what you want to do but you can
100:35 - do a lot with JavaScript nowadays so
100:39 - it's probably a safe thing to learn just
100:41 - in terms of uh being able to get a job
100:44 - you if you know JavaScript you open
100:46 - yourself up to a wide range of
100:48 - jobs um I
100:52 - I don't want to say like more than any
100:54 - other language but it's probably one of
100:56 - the top programming
100:59 - languages uh just in terms of jobs
101:06 - available uh bird person asks do you use
101:09 - Docker for node.js app I have used
101:12 - Docker in the past uh I'm not I don't
101:15 - know it well enough to be comfortable
101:17 - with it for using it for uh for like
101:19 - things that I'm actually making for
101:21 - clients uh or for work uh but I would
101:24 - like to use it more I just haven't taken
101:27 - the time to learn it so um if you know
101:30 - of any good resources for learning
101:32 - Docker uh that's cool I did a plural
101:35 - site course on Docker
101:37 - before uh but yeah I'd definitely like
101:40 - to learn more about
101:47 - it Alberto says your phone started going
101:50 - off right when I got a text from uh my
101:54 - wife yeah it did it was actually my my
101:56 - wife just called and normally I would
101:58 - answer but I think I'm going to end the
102:00 - stream here in just a minute so that's
102:01 - I'm just going to call her back uh I
102:05 - know I know she told me earlier that I
102:08 - have to be home
102:09 - by by 6 so I definitely have time it's
102:12 - only 3:42 here in in my time zone so I'm
102:16 - not sure what she
102:19 - wanted
102:31 - Ahmed said Jesse I'm relieve you're
102:32 - being positive and sorry about that
102:34 - someone yeah I mean I'm not really upset
102:36 - I don't even remember who the person was
102:38 - that was getting on me about uh jQuery
102:40 - and I was cool with it too like I'm I'm
102:43 - trying to get away from using jQuery as
102:45 - much um the only thing I don't like is
102:48 - if people are getting on each other
102:49 - during the chat uh but if you if you
102:52 - want to say something to me I'm cool
102:54 - with that uh but uh I kind of like to
102:57 - keep it at the the live chat and the
102:59 - comments and everything I like to keep
103:01 - it a place where people can ask
103:03 - questions and not be
103:05 - afraid uh that somebody's going to you
103:08 - know respond with something snarky or
103:10 - mean or something like that so um so
103:14 - yeah that's the only thing that I really
103:16 - uh get upset about and don't
103:19 - like
103:29 - James says I read an article said that
103:31 - programming is the new learning for kids
103:33 - yeah I I definitely agree with that I
103:36 - I've I've read some stuff about that too
103:38 - and
103:39 - I'm education is not usually known for
103:42 - being like on top of things and ahead of
103:45 - the game and really fast at least like
103:46 - especially higher education is super
103:48 - slow uh but I'm surprised surprised that
103:51 - there aren't more schools that are
103:52 - requiring programming like I know at
103:55 - least in the United
103:56 - States a lot of schools require to be
103:59 - able to graduate let's say from high
104:01 - school you have to have so many courses
104:04 - in a foreign language but realistically
104:07 - in the United States if you know English
104:10 - you're fine you'll probably never have
104:12 - to know another language now I know in
104:13 - certain places in the United States
104:15 - Spanish is also spoken a lot but but you
104:19 - can get you know everything that you
104:21 - need to do unless you really want to
104:22 - work in a certain area or a certain
104:24 - industry like you can get away with
104:26 - English so I'm wondering
104:29 - like would it not be more useful to more
104:31 - people if we included programming
104:34 - languages under languages or something
104:37 - like that I mean we uh I just think that
104:40 - we require students to learn things that
104:43 - are way less useful than programming and
104:47 - a lot of these curriculums were made you
104:49 - know years and years ago we've been
104:50 - teaching the same basic concepts uh for
104:54 - so long that it doesn't take into
104:56 - account what's going on today and what
104:59 - what jobs are available today and what
105:00 - the needs are uh for for employees so
105:06 - anyway sorry sorry for that little uh
105:10 - for me getting on my soap box there
105:12 - but
105:15 - um but anyway I I think kids um even in
105:20 - Young young kids should be introduced
105:21 - into basic programming con Concepts uh
105:25 - early
105:30 - on uh Tom asks how important is
105:32 - algorithm
105:33 - scripting uh I would say like for your
105:36 - dayto day work like for me in my
105:37 - day-to-day work I rarely ever need to do
105:40 - stuff with algorithms I mean it
105:42 - occasionally I do but if I was looking
105:44 - for a job I would be doing algorithms
105:46 - every day and practicing because you'll
105:48 - probably have to do an algorithm for
105:51 - your uh for your interviews so it there
105:55 - are probably some jobs where algorithms
105:57 - come into play way more often so it
106:00 - might just depend on what you what kind
106:02 - of job you
106:05 - want uh Rich asks do you work for free
106:08 - code camp or do you volunteer I just
106:10 - volunteer I don't I don't get anything
106:12 - for this I don't get any payment I don't
106:14 - even I don't run ads on my personal
106:17 - YouTube channel or anything so um yeah I
106:20 - don't I don't get anything for
106:26 - this ahed says Jess he just talked to
106:29 - her you know that's why I'm not going to
106:31 - get married yeah he was referring to my
106:33 - wife calling actually I should check and
106:35 - see if she texted
106:38 - me it looks like she did
106:46 - text okay she said so she I she told me
106:50 - I needed to be home by 6:00 but if she
106:52 - saw me earlier at home then she would
106:54 - feed me dinner
106:56 - so so it seems like that's all she
106:58 - wanted which that's that's nice it's
107:00 - good to
107:03 - eat I probably will try to get home
107:05 - before six
107:07 - because I do have a lot of work to do
107:10 - but as as you know I'm I'm definitely
107:13 - into overtime territory so I need to try
107:15 - to leave early at least sometimes to
107:17 - make that
107:19 - up uh
107:22 - um wizzy says in response to Rich's
107:27 - [Music]
107:28 - question I'm sorry was says any sites
107:31 - that give projects to work
107:34 - on like a few easy things so I can get
107:37 - the hang of C I don't know I didn't see
107:40 - I guess I didn't see oh okay Rich had a
107:43 - question earlier that I didn't see and
107:44 - it said uh said learn more from working
107:47 - on your own projects than just following
107:49 - a guide
107:53 - okay so I guess I missed a little
107:55 - conversation here about whether it's
107:57 - better to work on a project or follow
107:59 - guides in general you do learn more from
108:01 - working on a project but if you're just
108:03 - starting out in something you sometimes
108:05 - you need the guide
108:06 - first and then you
108:09 - can uh then you can know enough to do
108:12 - the project so it kind of just depends
108:14 - on your level of
108:15 - expertise at least that's that's my been
108:18 - my experience with it
108:25 - uh and Rich says you know think of
108:26 - something yourself um in terms of
108:29 - projects if it's something you're
108:31 - interested in it's a bit easier to stick
108:33 - with so like think of a problem you may
108:35 - face and see if you can solve
108:37 - it I think that's great
108:40 - advice um yeah find something that you
108:43 - are interested in you're way more likely
108:45 - to stick with it so definitely uh really
108:48 - good advice
108:49 - rich
108:57 - sorry I don't know if you guys heard
108:58 - that my stomach just growled was just
109:00 - making noise so I apologize for that if
109:03 - that sounded weird on the on the stream
109:06 - there uh actually I haven't really eaten
109:10 - anything today I just have like
109:12 - um like these weight gain like shakes so
109:15 - basically it's you can drink it but it's
109:17 - a ton of calories and then that way I
109:19 - can just keep working and drink this
109:21 - stuff and I get in my calories
109:24 - so I'm always looking for little ways to
109:27 - be more efficient and get in more
109:29 - coding so I haven't eaten any solid food
109:32 - yet
109:38 - today all right so rich says uh was just
109:42 - Cur this is I guess in response to um so
109:45 - he had asked if I worked for free code
109:47 - camp or I was a volunteer and um I said
109:50 - no I'm a volunteer so he said you are a
109:52 - full-time Dev though uh how much work
109:55 - would you say you do outside of the
109:57 - office if you don't just work at home
110:00 - yeah so um it depends so I am a
110:03 - full-time Dev I do work in an office uh
110:07 - but occasionally I have clients on the
110:09 - side that I do work for and so it just
110:11 - depends on if I have a client and what
110:14 - the client is so I do have some steady
110:15 - clients that I do really minor work for
110:17 - like every month and I wouldn't even
110:19 - call it programming work it's really
110:21 - like uploading blog post to Wordpress I
110:24 - don't really like to do that work but
110:26 - it's more like it's almost like a favor
110:29 - you know it's like some local nonprofits
110:31 - that I do things for um one of the
110:34 - nonprofits my great aunt is on the board
110:37 - for so it's kind of a favor to her and
110:39 - the other one is like a family friend
110:41 - runs this nonprofit so um so I charge
110:44 - them like a really really low rate
110:47 - compared to what I would charge like a
110:48 - real company uh and I do the work so
110:52 - it's just really basic stuff
110:53 - occasionally I do get a client that I I
110:55 - have I do like a legit site for and then
110:59 - sometimes I work a lot outside so I
111:02 - might there have been times when I would
111:04 - put in like an extra 30 or 40 hours a
111:07 - week on top of my normal full-time job
111:10 - to get a site launch for a client that
111:13 - now that's only probably a few weeks out
111:15 - of the year that I would work like that
111:17 - and I don't like to work like that if I
111:19 - can avoid it uh so but it just
111:28 - varies uh garv asks what's the best
111:32 - JavaScript framework to start
111:34 - with honestly here's what I'm G this is
111:38 - going to be unpopular but I'll give two
111:40 - answers I'm going to say what the
111:41 - easiest one to start with is and then
111:43 - I'll say what the best one to start with
111:45 - so I mean assuming that you've already
111:47 - learned some just regular JavaScript
111:50 - which is would be good to start with I
111:52 - would say the best framework in my
111:54 - opinion to learn would be react simply
111:57 - because there are so many react jobs
112:00 - available now it seems to be in really
112:02 - high demand I found react to be easier
112:04 - to pick up than angular was I I tried
112:08 - and failed at angular when it back when
112:10 - it was angular version one so I don't
112:12 - know about the newer versions maybe it's
112:13 - easier but I had trouble with it at
112:15 - first so I would say react if you want
112:18 - to know the easiest framework to use
112:22 - than it's jQuery and don't don't
112:24 - everybody hate me for that but
112:28 - realistically there are still a lot of
112:29 - jobs out there and a lot of places that
112:31 - use jQuery
112:33 - so it seems like it's not popular to use
112:36 - among devs but among actual websites
112:39 - that are out there it's very prevalent
112:42 - so those sites still need people to work
112:45 - on them so if if you're looking for
112:46 - something to get into that's easy to
112:49 - understand then
112:51 - I mean people should know some jQuery
112:52 - it's not that hard to pick up but if
112:55 - you're taking on clients like random
112:58 - clients and businesses like you're going
113:00 - to have to do something with jQuery at
113:01 - some point so uh you may as well I guess
113:06 - learn that at first just don't use it
113:07 - for everything you know try to learn how
113:09 - to do it the regular JavaScript way try
113:12 - to learn how to do it in react or if you
113:13 - want to go with angular try to do it in
113:15 - that so uh it's easy to just you kind of
113:18 - use jQuery as a CR for
113:20 - everything and then when you have to do
113:23 - something without it it's really
113:45 - hard uh Ahmed says I wrote a Blog on
113:48 - using git it's on LinkedIn please
113:50 - comment on it once you connect with me
113:51 - so yeah I definitely will Amed and if
113:53 - anybody else uh you know check out
113:55 - amed's blog on on LinkedIn uh it's about
113:59 - using git so if you want to if you need
114:01 - some help using git check that
114:05 - out wizzy said I guess your stomach
114:07 - wants to reach home before 6'2
114:12 - yeah ammed says I was once like you not
114:14 - eating food but having fun coding only
114:17 - to realize after seven years that it's
114:19 - an unending story
114:22 - yeah it's true like I probably
114:26 - should I probably should eat more like I
114:29 - legit at one point I lost so much weight
114:32 - because I was just coating and not
114:33 - eating that my clothes didn't fit
114:34 - anymore I had to buy new clothes uh so I
114:38 - actually used an app I used my fitness
114:40 - pile to track my calories so I
114:42 - remembered to eat and then I did gain
114:45 - some weight but now I I I didn't I got a
114:48 - new phone and I never installed that app
114:50 - again so now I'm back back down to um
114:55 - not fitting in my clothes
115:11 - anymore uh Rich says thanks for
115:13 - answering I ask as I see another FCC
115:16 - video FCC being free code Camp a day at
115:19 - Amazon it's seemed he worked at home a
115:20 - lot as well as in the office yeah I um I
115:24 - do some work at home like for this job
115:27 - that I at the University that's my
115:29 - normal full-time job I do work from home
115:31 - sometimes I'm not like I'm supposed to
115:35 - work here in the office fulltime right
115:38 - so but if I don't feel well I'm I work
115:43 - from home uh just to like not get
115:46 - anybody else uh sick in in my office so
115:49 - that's when I can work from home I would
115:52 - like to be allowed to do more work from
115:55 - home so that's something I'm probably
115:58 - going to negotiate um
116:01 - possibly uh I'm possibly thinking like
116:04 - at some point you know when it would be
116:06 - time that
116:08 - maybe maybe I could negotiate to be able
116:10 - to work from home instead of like a bump
116:13 - up in salary like maybe if there's a
116:15 - time when financially it's just not
116:17 - possible for my department to give the
116:19 - arrays or anything then that would be a
116:21 - good time to try to say like hey well
116:23 - how about you know I can do some remote
116:25 - work
116:26 - instead which would be which would be
116:29 - nice I mean it you don't I don't have to
116:31 - drive in to work I don't have to spend
116:33 - time you know getting them dressed up
116:34 - and ready I can just you know sit at
116:37 - home uh and and do the work from there
116:40 - so that's kind of my plan I would like
116:43 - to do more work from home although it
116:44 - it's kind of hard though if the kids are
116:47 - there uh sometimes times it's
116:49 - distracting but if the kids aren't home
116:53 - I get a lot more work done at home than
116:55 - I do in the office uh because in the
116:57 - office people could just walk by and you
116:59 - know talk to me about things like if I
117:01 - have to go stop somewhere I always run
117:03 - into people on the way and and like
117:05 - every little errand at work takes way
117:14 - longer uh rudaki says Jesse what do you
117:18 - do to not forget the things you've
117:19 - learned I've heard some devs use space
117:21 - repetition software like anky is that
117:23 - common in the community I
117:26 - actually I read about Anie and I
117:29 - downloaded an app for it and then I
117:31 - never used it for me to remember the
117:34 - things that I've learned the best way
117:36 - for me is to keep using them in
117:40 - projects uh so there's definitely
117:42 - something to be said like it let's say
117:45 - that you're you're practicing for an
117:48 - interview and you know certain questions
117:51 - are going to be on there then using
117:53 - something like anky would probably be
117:56 - beneficial but otherwise just doing the
118:00 - work will force you to remember it you
118:04 - know you you'll start remembering things
118:06 - that functions that you use constantly
118:08 - syntax that you use constantly or
118:10 - commands on you know terminal commands
118:13 - that you use constantly you'll remember
118:14 - it at first you'll have to look it up
118:16 - but at some point you won't have to look
118:18 - it up anymore and you'll remember it
118:19 - naturally I like that way of doing
118:21 - things because you know you're actually
118:23 - getting work done while you're doing it
118:26 - and to me that's kind of a more natural
118:27 - way like that that's how kids that's how
118:30 - babies pick things up you know they
118:32 - don't learn with like flat flash right
118:34 - you don't do flashcards with a baby to
118:36 - teach them how to how to talk they pick
118:38 - it up by hearing what you say and trying
118:42 - to mimic that so to me I think that's a
118:45 - much more natural way of doing things
118:46 - and it it works for me uh but so you
118:49 - know people have different methods of
118:51 - learning so what works for me might not
118:52 - work you know for you or for someone
118:54 - else
118:56 - so uh but I do think if if you do have
118:59 - certain things that you know you will
119:01 - have to memorize and you need to know it
119:02 - quickly then something like anky uh
119:05 - which is like a space repetition of the
119:08 - same uh knowledge the same information
119:11 - would be beneficial in that case I just
119:14 - don't really ever have a case like that
119:16 - uh in for what I do
119:20 - uh if you were still in school like that
119:21 - would definitely work for test
119:24 - though uh ammed says Jesse man so many
119:27 - hours after regular job I should start
119:29 - drinking the energy drink you mentioned
119:32 - yeah so uh here's my unofficial
119:34 - commercial for my energy drink that I I
119:36 - don't I don't get paid to sponsor or do
119:39 - anything at all but I I drink
119:42 - gfuel and uh I'm not a doctor so don't
119:45 - take my word for it but it's basically
119:47 - if you ever used 5H Hour Energy
119:50 - it basically is the same stuff that's in
119:52 - 5our energy except it's in powdered form
119:54 - so it's cheaper and you can get it
119:56 - shipped to you cheaper and you mix it
119:58 - with water so anyway they Market it to
120:01 - like professional Gamers but I find that
120:03 - it does help me
120:05 - out for uh for my coating so uh and I
120:09 - like it better like Red Bull and stuff
120:11 - that those energy drinks have a lot of
120:12 - sugar and things in them and this
120:15 - doesn't have a ton of sugar in it so
120:17 - it's it is it's better for you in that
120:19 - sense that it's not filled with
120:21 - sugar if you do use g-u I recommend
120:24 - getting one of the flavors that has some
120:26 - type of citrus in it the stuff without
120:27 - Citrus for me is just too sweet you need
120:30 - that like little tanginess from the
120:31 - Citrus to cut the
120:41 - sweetness uh Justin
120:43 - says I guess it just it depends on what
120:46 - your initial struggle with angularjs was
120:48 - a lot has changed now they're on version
120:50 - 4 but moved to an evergreen naming
120:52 - convention yeah that's what I thought
120:54 - Justin I I expect that there are two
120:57 - problems with my early experience with
120:59 - angular one I just wasn't that good with
121:01 - JavaScript period at the time like this
121:03 - was years ago when angular was somewhat
121:06 - new and I just didn't have the
121:07 - experience if I tried to learn it again
121:09 - now I'm sure I would be way more
121:11 - successful uh also angular has has come
121:14 - a long way since then as well so my
121:16 - opinion on angular is probably not that
121:19 - that great I don't trust it too much
121:21 - because when I talk about angular I'm
121:23 - talking
121:24 - about angular one and I'm talking about
121:27 - a version of me that was way less
121:29 - skilled at
121:39 - JavaScript uh Justin says Pomodoro Timer
121:41 - man yeah I I do use Pomodoro timers so I
121:45 - got my pomodora timer up right now I was
121:48 - just using it
121:50 - using it for work
121:51 - earlier uh the problem is when I have
121:53 - that like five minute break between
121:55 - Pomodoro sessions I usually check email
121:58 - and stuff and so I don't get I don't get
122:01 - time to do anything
122:04 - else uh ahed says Jesse please join a
122:08 - gym in that case you can't stop eating
122:10 - and your clothes will fit to yeah I need
122:13 - to uh I need to start working out again
122:15 - I've been really busy with work and I've
122:17 - put that off so
122:19 - uh I need I found like if I don't work
122:21 - out my uh my mental health just is is
122:25 - really bad so like not only physically
122:27 - but like mentally I just get way more
122:29 - like depressed maybe that's why the guy
122:32 - that left earlier said I sounded bored
122:34 - maybe I I just need to work out maybe
122:36 - I'm getting depressed uh but yeah it it
122:39 - helps me mentally I'm way more positive
122:41 - and upbeat it actually makes it easier
122:43 - for me to figure out problems that with
122:45 - when I'm coding so uh I I know what I
122:49 - need to do it's just a matter of of
122:51 - doing it and having the willpower to do
123:06 - it uh amed's ask saying for react do you
123:09 - know some site to start with I don't
123:11 - want to go through the videos now just
123:13 - some quality uh reads would make more
123:17 - sense um
123:20 - react trying to think I think uh code
123:25 - academy has some react stuff like intro
123:28 - to react tutorial stuff um it's not like
123:32 - just reading it's you know you're doing
123:33 - the exercises but that's like a good
123:35 - place to start and then the react
123:36 - documentation itself is not really that
123:38 - hard to read
123:41 - through
123:44 - uh let's
123:47 - see
123:54 - Alberto says in terms of energy drinks
123:57 - that he drinks some green tea thing
123:59 - forget what it's called though but it's
124:01 - it is
124:02 - carbonated um yeah I've tried green tea
124:04 - before I actually have green tea
124:08 - pills uh so I found like they just they
124:12 - don't work that much they don't give you
124:14 - that energy so I have uh my
124:16 - brother-in-law he does um
124:20 - he like sells tickets online for things
124:22 - buys and sells them and he does stuff in
124:23 - the stock market and he uses green tea
124:25 - pills they work for him but for me I
124:28 - just I haven't had that much luck with
124:30 - him but I really do like to actually
124:32 - drink green tea just for pleasure and
124:34 - not for
124:45 - energy James says I wish I could gain
124:48 - weight actually I was successful I
124:50 - gained like 25
124:52 - lbs I know this has nothing to do with
124:54 - coding sorry to anybody that I'm getting
124:57 - off track here
124:58 - but just for like 30 seconds I'm going
125:01 - to tell you how I managed to gain like
125:02 - 25 PBS in just like two or three months
125:06 - um so I downloaded the uh My Fitness Pal
125:10 - app and I set a Target goal a weight
125:13 - goal right and then it it helps you
125:15 - figure out how many calories you need to
125:16 - take in so I didn't have to do all that
125:19 - math they did it for me then I had like
125:22 - the weight gain shakes that would give
125:25 - me a lot of um I don't remember what
125:28 - they're called I get them from Amazon
125:30 - subscribe and save and so every month I
125:32 - just get these big bags of like weight
125:34 - gain uh powder right you just mix it
125:36 - with milk and just a lot of protein and
125:39 - a lot of stuff so basically I would just
125:40 - keep track of what I was eating every
125:42 - day to make sure I hit that calorie goal
125:45 - then I also made sure that I worked out
125:47 - so every day like after work I'd come in
125:50 - I come in through my basement door I
125:52 - have like all my clothes and stuff are
125:55 - down in the basement by the washing
125:57 - machine so I change out of my work
125:59 - clothes right there before I do anything
126:00 - else and then I had a little weight set
126:03 - and a weight bench right next to the
126:05 - laundry room so I'd go right from
126:07 - changing out of my work clothes right to
126:10 - there I'd do like a little work just
126:11 - like a 15minute workout tried to just
126:14 - lift like the heaviest weights I could
126:17 - and uh then I would go upstairs and see
126:19 - my family and that way like I always got
126:22 - it in and immediately after that I'd go
126:26 - upstairs and eat eat dinner so I'd get
126:28 - some calories in right away I did that
126:30 - consistently for like two or three
126:32 - months and I was able to gain that
126:35 - weight and it was basically like mostly
126:37 - muscle weight I mean I uh I would do
126:40 - some
126:41 - cardio uh as well and that was M
126:44 - basically for mental health because if
126:46 - you do like 45 minutes of cardio every
126:48 - day
126:49 - uh it does help your your mood a lot
126:51 - like you know in your mental health so
126:54 - that was my how I did it it honestly
126:57 - just takes discipline to be able to eat
127:00 - the amount of calories and to keep doing
127:03 - the
127:08 - workouts uh Alberto says I I'm in a a
127:13 - pretty non-code intensive day day job so
127:16 - spend for like from 7:30 a.m. to 400
127:19 - p.m. doing mostly admin type work but
127:21 - then go home do some yoga and work on a
127:23 - web project in net uh until whatever
127:27 - sometime in the am in the next
127:30 - morning uh that's pretty
127:34 - uh that's pretty tough schedule too
127:37 - going home and working on projects at
127:39 - night that's like I'm
127:42 - uh I'm impressed by that because I I
127:46 - know that's it's tough like
127:49 - it's tough to have the energy and the
127:51 - motivation at the end of the day after
127:52 - you've already
127:58 - worked uh Hubert says uh where's the
128:02 - coding
128:03 - sorry just join 10 minutes ago yeah
128:05 - we're doing the question and answer
128:06 - stuff so we kind of got away from coding
128:08 - and we we were getting into nutrition
128:11 - for coders I guess um but yeah I'm
128:14 - actually going to wrap up the live chat
128:15 - here in a few minutes but the uh video
128:18 - of the code portion of it and everything
128:20 - will be available about a minute or two
128:23 - after I wrap up so you can check out the
128:25 - uh the
128:27 - recording uh Rich says I'm a student
128:30 - will hopefully graduate in three months
128:32 - time at the age of 32 any advice as I
128:35 - Look to get into the industry with no
128:37 - experience of working in this area uh
128:39 - manual work previously
128:43 - um so I would say uh work on projects
128:49 - and that's Amed is giving the same
128:51 - advice here um yeah work on
128:54 - projects so if you don't already have
128:56 - projects that you're working on uh get
128:59 - some uh like contribute to other
129:01 - people's open- Source projects on
129:04 - GitHub uh and that'll that'll show
129:07 - employers that you can do the work and
129:11 - that you're passionate about the coding
129:13 - and what you do because if you're taking
129:14 - time where you're not even getting paid
129:16 - to work on this obvious viously like
129:18 - this is something you you like to do uh
129:21 - so I would do that and then try to get
129:24 - until you find full-time work try to get
129:26 - some clients uh you know
129:28 - freelancing so I maybe start out in your
129:31 - local area to try to get some if you
129:34 - really can't find it you can go on some
129:35 - of the freelancing sites I haven't had
129:37 - much luck with that you probably won't
129:39 - make very much money
129:41 - but if you just need some work you know
129:45 - it's not a bad place to go uh so
129:49 - and then just keep you know keep
129:50 - learning and if you have to take a job
129:53 - that's not coding related to pay the
129:54 - bills then you know that's that's cool
129:57 - too uh just make sure that you always
130:00 - like try to keep uh keep
130:08 - coding oh James said I had to have my
130:10 - colon removed sorry to hear that
130:15 - James I hope uh I hope everything's
130:18 - healing up well and uh and
130:23 - properly I know my wife went through
130:25 - major surgery uh in like beginning in
130:29 - November so uh I know that can be really
130:32 - tough to recover from I know even now
130:34 - she's still having complications from
130:35 - the surgery so uh good good luck with
130:47 - that
130:50 - Umberto says uh need a software Dev day
130:53 - job said then the evenings would be all
130:55 - about my wife and me she's been super
130:57 - understanding about my craving to code
130:59 - that's awesome that's really important
131:01 - if um you know you have your family's
131:03 - understanding about things and it's
131:05 - important to spend time with family too
131:06 - and I mean I I say that knowing that I
131:09 - don't always spend as much time with my
131:11 - family as I should uh because you just
131:13 - get into the work uh you know there's
131:16 - deadlines things need to get done so
131:18 - don't forget that though I mean the work
131:21 - will always be there but your family
131:23 - might not you know even like your kids
131:24 - grow up you know they leave at some
131:26 - point your kids don't want to hang out
131:28 - with you anymore
131:30 - so uh and I'm I'm saying this I I need
131:34 - to take my own advice so I'm saying this
131:36 - to myself as
131:47 - well
131:50 - Amed says sorry to hear about your wife
131:52 - Jesse take care of her yeah I mean she's
131:55 - she's doing good now to the point like
131:58 - there's just some weird complications
131:59 - and stuff going on from her surgery so
132:02 - um the the worst part is I don't want to
132:05 - get like super personal so I don't want
132:07 - to weird anybody out but like the worst
132:08 - part is for us like she's she's not able
132:10 - to have kids anymore and that was like
132:13 - unexpected uh you know we had we had
132:16 - thought that we'd be able to have more
132:17 - kids we're really young like I'm only
132:19 - 31 uh so uh kind of expected to have
132:23 - more years of kids so that's kind of the
132:25 - for me at least that's like the really
132:27 - the toughest part and then for my wife
132:29 - still having like pain and things going
132:31 - on so uh she's just been doing physical
132:35 - therapy and and seeing a lot of doctors
132:37 - and stuff but hopefully uh she's one of
132:41 - her doctors has her on this new like
132:43 - nutrition plan and physical therapy and
132:45 - stuff so we're hoping that that'll work
132:47 - work out and help
132:55 - her okay cool and I've reached the end
132:57 - of the live chat so that I kind of ended
133:00 - on like a down note so I didn't intend
133:02 - to but then I just reached the end of
133:04 - the chat so uh thanks um for all the
133:08 - support I have some people in the live
133:10 - chat giving some messages of support for
133:12 - for me and for my wife and uh I really
133:15 - appreciate that um
133:19 - thank thank you for
133:21 - that oh James says there are a lot of
133:23 - kids out there that need to be adopted
133:25 - that's always a good alternative yeah
133:26 - you're right James that's true I I did
133:28 - look into uh my my oldest son is seven
133:31 - and he was asking me about adopting kids
133:34 - uh a few weeks back and so I checked out
133:36 - I checked into it right now it actually
133:39 - costs a lot of money to adopt
133:42 - um at least to adopt like babies and
133:45 - stuff so it's a little bit out of my
133:47 - range right now now but hopefully in the
133:50 - future I'll be at a place financially
133:52 - where that's possible and uh yeah I mean
133:55 - I I love I love babies I love kids I
133:58 - love having kids around so I'm
133:59 - definitely open to um to adopting uh one
134:03 - day at some point I think if I can
134:07 - always have a little kid like or want to
134:10 - come home to I'll be I'll be fine no
134:13 - matter what happens at work if you can
134:14 - come home and there's a little one there

134:18 - hug and uh that just it just like wipes
134:22 - away all the nonsense that happened that

136:17 - all have been really great and uh really
136:19 - helpful when I had all those errors and
136:21 - things come up so I really appreciate

136:34 - pool request before uh but I'll be back
136:39 - tomorrow and uh hopefully I'll maybe we
136:43 - can have some uh good news about the
136:45 - pool request maybe it's it'll be

136:50 - uh have have a great day uh I'll see
136:53 - yall
136:59 - tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse and uh thanks for uh joining me today uh so I'm going to do something a little bit different so normally I work on a project uh that I'm I'm doing for work so but today I'm going to contribute to someone else's project so if you watch yesterday uh then you you'll know what I'm talking about if you didn't watch I'll kind of explain how I got to this point uh so yesterday I was trying to set up click tracking for Google analytics and I was already using something called uh react GA so it was uh in npm uh module that made it easier for you to use Google analytics and re react but when I finally got it I had some other unrelated problems during yesterday's stream but when I finally got it working and I went to click the link I wanted it to open in a new tab but it was blocked the browser treated it as a popup and blocked it by default so that's not what I wanted so I had to end the stream right when uh I found that error or I should say uh you all in the live chat found the error as well I think before me uh but I didn't have time to fix it right then during the stream so later on after I had a really really long meeting I found the answer and um or I at least got on the right track to the answer and so what I did is I made a component uh to use that was kind of like a wrapper around what react GA was already providing and now it works so I'll show you the component first and then I'm going to take you through the process the whole process of forking the react G repository uh making the changes and then submitting a pool request so I have no idea if the pool request will get uh merged in or not but but this this does work I tested it out so uh hopefully we can get everything merged in so I thought I had this up I guess I don't but here's the component okay so I will say the idea for this I I got from an issue that was already open so there are several issues open about this I think I found three of them uh that were all about the same issue so I'm going to I'm actually going to show you just so that you could see kind of the difference here so a Acom in April uh was able to do this and this ended up working okay it worked for for Acom it worked for this guy and it worked for me and uh I guess some other people too because it got four thumbs up one of those is my thumbs up so he did this I copied this and tried to use it and it didn't work now I'm sure it was probably something I was doing that it didn't work because it worked for these other people so I probably somehow messed it up but what I did then to get it to work for me was I I kind of combined what was done in another component so the layout component that I had have and um this this was brought in from a uh pool request and I can't remember who exactly did this this P I submitted the pull request for this one but uh I I thought you know what this layout component is doing a similar thing in terms of you know what it's bringing in and what it's outputting as to what I want to do so I basically took the structure of this layout component and I combined it with what was going on basically in in this part here and I made a new component uh so the combination of those two components works and this is what it does basically is I as an input it takes in a two which is basically your atref that You' normally put on a link it takes a label this is what's going to show up in Google analytics uh and then it takes you know whatever other props you put on there so like your title tag you normally put on a link or any classes that you want to put on there and that all gets in in here right so what gets outputed then is a regular link with all your props your href which is the value for two it says Target blank all by default and then it has this click Handler so on click it runs this and this is what's going to log the event as a click and send it to Google analytics okay so when done like this it behaves properly and it it opens it in another window and I'll show you just just to give you some proof that it's actually working so I push this to the reposit or to the live site and I click it and there it opens in another window and and I'm not going to go through showing it in Google analytics but it does show up in Google analytics and we'll inspect it I'll just just want to show you what it looks like here if you can't already guess you see what gets oops too big what gets put out here is an a tag looks like a normal a tag with the exception of this you know react ID but I mean that's normal for react uh so that's the the change that I want to submit basically I'm going to submit a new component that's going to be just for the situation where someone wants to track an outbound link and they want that link to open in a new window and so that's it's it's going to be pretty straightforward in in terms of a a pull request I'm not going to actually even change anything that's already there I'm just going to add one extra component so we shouldn't have any conflicts or anything like that so uh it'll be if if the maintainers of that repository want to bring it in it should be pretty easy for them to bring it in I know there's there's some style differences I noticed between what I did here and what they're doing so aside from that we can probably use this as is the only difference is I think I'm going to change the name I just used the name from uh that issue and uh but I'm going to change the name to make it more obvious that this is just for links that you want to open in a new window all right so since I've given the introduction here I'm going to check out the live chat and uh see who's here and who's saying hi um hey everyone a lot of people saying I okay so someone asked PR is a pool request so we had uh that's been explained in the live chat yeah so I didn't want the title to be really really long so I did abbreviate PR if you're not familiar with that that's pool request and that's what you it's called when you submit uh a change to someone's uh project on GitHub all right uh La Xavier says I'm going to watch this later at higher speed man sounds too bored for me do I really sound bored uh actually I think I do sometimes I I don't usually listen to my videos but occasionally I do and I do think I sound bored sometimes so I actually try to like have caffeine and stuff beforehand so that I'm a little bit more awake but um I don't know I'm normally kind of really laid back so it's hard to it's hard to put on the ACT that I'm upbeat but I'll I'll do my best um okay so I think um I think I've gotten through everything in the live chat all right well actually there's one question is free code cam good enough to help me change my field uh so har me asked that um free code Camp's a good start and I know people that have done free code camp and then gotten jobs so if you want to be a web developer free code Camp is really good for that if you want to go into anything else uh in in the field you know if you want to develop I don't know like desktop apps I mean with I realize that you can use things other things like electron or react native to develop uh desktop and and uh mobile apps but basically it kind of depends on what you want to do uh but you could I would supplement it though I mean it's always good to supplement depending on what particular project you're working on at the time so if anyone else has any advice for har meat about uh whether or not free code Camp is good enough to get the the learning he needs to change his field uh go ahead and put it in the live chat or in the comments to the video later on uh I personally have used a lot of other resources but it might be helpful if somebody if you've mainly used free code camp and been able to get a job with that then you're probably the person that harate uh needs to talk to all right here's another question about pool requests from Zeal so I'm going to answer this because this really does it's pertinent to the topic today it says why is it referred to as a pull request when you are pushing up to fb's repo I don't know what FB is but uh is it because the repo owner is pulling your code yeah basically uh is you're requesting that the owner of the repo pull your code in yeah so it's it's from the perspective of the repo owner so from your perspective you're pushing code right but from the repo owner perspective they're pulling it so you're asking them requesting that they pull the code in oh okay Z said FB was Facebook yeah so I'm actually uh let me show you the repo I've linked to it in the description as well so here's the repo that I'm going to be pushing through uh and this is what we worked with yesterday as well so this this is not as far as I know this is not from Facebook I mean I potentially could be mistaken I think it's uh unrelated to the official you know react project from Facebook let me see the contributors are yeah I don't know I'm not seeing I don't see anybody in here that I usually see with uh with Facebook's official react stuff so um yeah so I don't know I think this is an unrelated uh repository so anyway let's get to it um first thing we're going to do is we're going to Fork the repo so I'm going to Fork it to my account while I'm waiting for this I'll let you know I did start that react uh course that I was talking to you all about yesterday the uh Udacity Nano degree uh for react so I started it I it went through it only started for me an hour an hour ago uh so I only did a little bit just to check it out so far it's cool it was all just introductory stuff but hopefully it ends up being a good course I'll give if you're interested I'll give some updates and then maybe you you all can decide whether or not it's worth it I've maybe one of you would like to take it as well okay so now we have a fork so you can see this is my GitHub uh account but then I have this okay so I mean this is basic stuff but if there's anyone watching that's not really familiar with Git or GitHub then I'm going to kind of go over each step so if you're really Advanced with with Git uh and GitHub then this might be a little bit basic uh at least at first for you uh might not be that exciting but I don't want to leave anybody behind so I'm going to try to be as detailed as I can okay so now we want to clone this repo so I'm going to copy this I'm going to bring over my terminal cuz that's what we're going to work in it first all right so let me open up let's make this bigger and we need to go into projects so I I keep everything everything I'm working on mostly is in my projects folder so you can see there's all all this stuff in here so once I'm in the projects folder I can type in get clone and then I'll paste that in uh since I have SSH key set up this will work otherwise you can use the uh https so you can click that use the https I think you need if you do it that way I think you need a password I haven't done it that way in so long I can't remember but um that's what you would use if you didn't have your keys set up already all right so let's clone that must be pretty small that was that was super fast so now if we check out our folders now we have react GA so let's go into it and you can see we have when for at least for my terminal I have it set so when I'm in a folder that's a get repository it shows me what branch I'm on SO we're in the master Branch I think that's the only Branch I'm going to check though yep Master Branch the only Branch what we want to do is make another Branch normally uh correct me if I'm wrong I don't have a ton of experience with this but normally you don't want to push changes on a master Branch right you want to create another branch and then submit that is your pool request um I just saw there's some activity in the live chat I'm just going to check back really quick I want try to keep up with the live chat today since yesterday I ran out of time and I didn't get to everyone's questions and I I really feel bad about that uh because I I like to be able to address you know all the questions okay uh um Zan Zan Zano is asking about the react course said $400 or something right the react Nano degree uh yeah I think it was 500 so it's not cheap uh I think as I said yesterday I I've said in the past before like I've I have never spent more than $30 like total in the last however many years I've been doing this on educational stuff for you know for learning how to be a developer um because there's so many great free resources but I really want to get better with react there's a lot of projects that I know I'm going to be working on coming up within the next year that I'm going to use react for so I decided like I'm just going to go for it and then the fact that I spent $500 on it is going to keep me it's going to get make me more dedicated I guess right so uh whenever I feel like oh I'm just I'm not I'm not going to do the work I'm going to put it off I'm too busy I'll think in the back of my mind like dude you spent $500 on this you better better not waste it so it's kind of like motivation for me all right so let's go back back to here so we're going to make a branch get branch and trying to think what I should name the branch um I'm going to say fix outbound fix outbound link does that sound all right if anybody thinks for some reason that the name for that branch is not good at all let me know I can just make a new Branch uh but I think that basically explains it uh so now I'm going to open this and Adam and this is totally unrehearsed so if you've watched before you know that it's un rehearsed because I mess up quite a bit uh but if I rehearsed it beforehand and I still messed up this much that would be kind of sad uh but if you're just watching for the first time this is all unrehearsed so um so this is the first time I'm I'm looking through this code I checked that a little bit on GitHub but uh basically we're going to be working I guess in this folder um test component yeah the only thing I'm I'm not sure about is what the test folder is because I'm no good I don't know what they're using for testing this might be the biggest problem here is writing tests so oh we'll see if anybody is recognizes what's going on here and uh can help me out I would appreciate that but otherwise let's just go to it let's make our component our new component and uh we got to figure out what to call call it so maybe it's definitely it's it's an outbound it's outbound link but we're opening it in new window I kind of want to call this component outbound Link new window I think that's too long but I don't know I've actually I remember reading something or seeing a video somewhere where some of the component names that were used uh for Facebook for building Facebook actually really long so I guess it's not terrible to do that uh so let's do that we'll call it outbound Link new new window so where's my sorry I got find my my terminal here um touch component oh no Source component and I'm going to call this outbound want to make sure yeah they are capitalizing that outbound Link new window Js Okay cool so now we've made that let's go in here I can get rid of these welcome screens uh I am going to take my code from here that I showed you a few minutes ago I'm going to pull it onto my other screen so that I can just pull pull the code over so first thing I'm going to do is just I guess I can copy and paste all of it cuz we're not really changing much so I don't know if I really ought to leave this in or not but I'll leave that up to the maintainers of the repo so that I just always like to uh give credit to where I get the ideas from so what all we need to change is I believe this name here right I think that's the only place place for using it yeah so that's it outlink new window out Link new window okay great so that's it that's all we need to change I'm going to save that and now let's go back and commit this change yep all right so add just going to add that and our k s is going to be add here we go all right so now we need to push this so we're going to go get push origin and what do we call this oh no did I I made the change on Master I'm going to look at the live chat and I'm sure you all have already caught that and uh have yeah you guys caught me oh man how long ago wow yeah it was like five minutes ago at least you all caught me all right so Shoot actually I'm gonna before I mess it up further I'm going to ask there's either two two things I could do one could I I haven't committed this change yet can I just remove what I added and not committed at all uh would that be the best way to do it or um does it even matter what I do to master when I go to submit the pool request I can just submit the one branch right like I could just do this go ahead with my commit copy it over to the other branch and then only submit that Branch correct let me uh let me see if I were to okay so um for everyone watching this later on I was just waiting for responses in the live chat here uh so create the branch from there but before just delete the old one okay so um yeah so I'll just commit these changes create a new Branch delete the Old Branch or flip that order but basically yeah that's what I'm gonna do okay oh wait and I did for some reason I thought I didn't actually commit it yet but I I did so sorry I'm sure you all were thinking like that I was crazy but all right so actually what what's the command for delete Branch it's just D I can I can do just SD okay cool I haven't had to delete a branch in so long I don't even remember uh get uh what did we call that one fix okay now just make a new Branch cool just to double check all right we switch there all this is on the branch okay we're good all right so now let's push that get push origin fix I found like Okay cool so now if we look at our repo so we should have another Branch cool so we have this branch and actually let me um let me pull up let me pull up github's instructions for submitting a pool request because I do want to show you the right way to do this so in instead of me fumbling around with it I mean it's not that hard you could probably figure it out but let's just do it the uh the way described in the GitHub help pages so all right so let's go to the original Repository we're going to go to new pool request I'm going to make this a little bit bigger for youall especially if someone's on like a low red screen or a small screen might be hard so we went back to the original repo react GA we're going to go new pull request and let's go compare changes so we have the base let's compare actually can also yeah we need to compare across Forks that that's what we need Okay so let's take what I did and we'll be able to fix out bound link and then we're going to compare it to the master right yeah oops is that should I switch this do I need a different order why is it telling me this okay I think possibly I just mixed up the order um correctly if I'm wrong in the uh in the live chat Master that's what we need now let's compare there we go that's it okay so oh you know what I totally forgot the whole uh testing thing totally forgot that I just I'm going to check really quick and see if they say something in the documentation about see p request oh no that was just a link to the issues thought it would be a a link to the bottom it's possible that they have yeah they do okay I should have looked for this first oh well um all right so we need to test all right I have gold installed so that's not a problem need to run a test okay so the disc file should not be committed until the review has been merged okay all right so if you're following along in the repo we're down at the bottom here uh otherwise you can just check it out on your screen so these are just some instructions for how to do the test the only thing that's confusing me is it's saying not to submit not to commit the disc files okay that's that makes more sense I I guess I didn't read that carefully enough all right so we got to be careful not to commit the disc files but otherwise it seems like all we'll need to do at least at first here is basically just this part and we don't have to worry about complete code yeah we don't have to worry about anything basically past this because we need to wait to hear back okay that makes sense if I'm understanding this incorrectly let me know uh in the live chat but otherwise we'll just do the tests hopefully everything works out uh as I said before the style is is different so I'm not sure you know if they want it to be of a particular style then that might be an issue all right so let's see if I run npm test this should work because like I said I think I already have golp installed globally let's go oops I never ran mpm install all right so since this is live I can't go back and edit this but what I should have done is as soon as I pulled the repo down I should have done an mpm install so I don't think it'll matter much for what we did since we B we just completely added a new component so that should be fine uh I'll check out we'll check out the package Json just to make sure there wasn't some sort of like hook uh commit hook that would have done something but otherwise I think this will be all right yeah uh in the live chat um with a comment it's or or yarn install yeah normally I do use yarn I didn't want to use it for this project because uh it said use npm so I just decided to just go with what they were doing uh let's see errors errors H okay so it's saying possibly I don't have the latest version s of node and mpm installed well that's no good all right does it give a version it doesn't really give a version number I wish I wish there was maybe up here it'll say mpm version 2.2.0 all right well let's see what version no all right that's not the npm version that's the version of this H all right so what I'm running 7.3.0 and npm 4.1.2 so I guess I'm going to have to update so bonus for this video if you've never updated these things we're going to do it so let's actually I'm going to update uh npm first and then see if that works and then I won't have to update node as well so should be able to update npm like this npm St not sure how long this will take so while that's loading I'm going to catch up in the live chat all right still have a decent amount of viewers I hadn't looked at the analytics of this video in a while and I thought man I've messed up so many things uh everybody is going to be gone all right wow that was super fast let's see I'm just checking to make sure there wasn't anything weird looks like everything worked and so let me just run npm install again maybe maybe it'll work this time nope all right let's see whoa okay for all right I'm just trying to read through some of this let's make it bigger okay I'm going to make this bigger so you all can see since there's a lot of text here okay probably should update uh node anyway since I haven't updated it in a while it's looking like now I'm not so sure it's a problem with my versions I'm going to go back to the live chat see if anybody has some ideas here all right so there's a question here I'm just going to answer it so I don't forget later do I plan on doing any react native live coding yes I do I just need to get a project where I'm going to be using it first but hopefully I'll have an opportunity for that ahed asks uh are you a professional in this field um yes so I guess if by professional you define professional someone who gets paid to do a certain thing then yes I'm a professional if by professional you're implying like that I'm an expert then probably no but I have been doing this for like four four years or so uh fulltime so I I am a frontend developer employed at a university Brian says good to know everyone has the same crappy problems no matter how advanced you are I don't know how advanced I am but yeah I haven't had a problem like this in a while I mean with if you don't count yesterday when the it things weren't updating right on the server and I didn't really fix it I just ran the same command again and it worked the second time uh so I'm going to check out it looks like we have uh node there's an issue already issue 489 for node so I'm going to look it up I'll just look it up on my other screen and pull it over if if we want to look at it aim high says I just got my first developer job starting on the 3rd of July awesome all right so yeah I remember was it probably two weeks ago or so uh you were in the live chat uh this is aim high in the live chat uh talking about looking for jobs and things and I I remember I had asked for for updates to keep us updated so thank you so much for keeping us updated ated uh that's that's really awesome I'm like I'm super happy for you uh so hopefully it goes all right and um you know if I don't know what your schedule will be it's your new job but if you can join in for some of the live chats uh that would be awesome and if you uh if you need any any help or advice with anything you know feel free to uh message me on Twitter um I'll uh I'll help with anything I can yeah a high says uh really excited but very nervous I understand the nervousness uh you'll get just the more you work um you you'll get over the nervousness but you'll have that at first but um you know just be confident be confident in your skills and uh just keep working on it and that's um it'll it'll be it'll be a I think it'll be great all right so let's see sorry I'm I got distracted from looking up this uh issue but it was big news uh so it's worth the distraction so what was that issue 489 okay okay so I'll pull this over so everyone can see uh so this this is the issue so let me scroll down a bit see if this looks like this looks like what we're getting yeah it's not it doesn't look exactly like what we're getting but I think it's worth checking out oh okay well xcode select install all right wow this is back in 2014 let me let me scroll down because I suspect some of the really old answers may not work so this this one was only 28 days ago um I I just saw Amed asked in the live chat should I go for iOS instead of Android um I don't know I I don't develop uh apps for phones right now so I'm probably not the best person to ask but if if I were going to go into developing apps based on what I know right now I would learn react native and I would um that would probably make it easier to develop for both so that's I mean that's my opinion on there but I'm sure someone who uh actually develops apps uh would probably be able to give you a better answer so don't uh don't put a lot of trust in my answer there because I'm not I'm not knowledgeable about you know the job outlook and salaries for like iOS versus Android developers all right let's see all right cool I like this idea uh run npm install G npm latest uh node let's try that I'm going to try this because it looks really easy and if it works then great if not it doesn't look like this will break anything okay cool doing something uh Emerson asks what course is better computer science or information systems um again I I don't know that I could give you a great answer for this I think it part it does depend on what you want to um so sorry I was I wasn't laughing at your question Emerson I was laughing at another comment there so yeah it depends on what you want to do uh if you want probably like something that would just be more broadly applicable then I guess computer science would be better uh I was actually I think I was brief I briefly majored in computer information systems for like one semester when I was getting my undergrad uh and then I I changed and majored in something else uh in well an economics and finance because I could graduate faster like that so when I was in college I was just worried about getting out of college as fast as I could with a degree so don't really recommend it but it is the cheaper way to go uh CU if you can graduate early you don't have to pay for more school all right so let's try this again see if it works so actually so in the in the chat so uh basic so XD in the in the chat which I mean I know that that's that's not how you you're going to pronounce it but just to be able to say it in the live chat saying you had the same issue is is this you that had this issue here or that wrote this here I can't tell because you're you're um your picture on the live chat at least on my screen is like super tiny so let me try to zoom in and see I can't really tell but uh okay cool I thought cuz the hair looked the same so I could defitely make out the hair all right cool sorry I didn't pick up on that uh sooner but no did it happen again all right what just happened here okay here's what I'm going to do I'm going to keep working on this and I'm G to try to fix it and I'm going to keep the live chat going or the live stream going but in case you don't have time to stick around for uh to figure this out then I'm just going to show you where would I have the pool request I'm just going to show you basically what the next next step would be if you wanted to submit the pool request and where do I have over here okay so assuming that you got everything to work and you wanted to submit the request so we're comparing it to the the master branch of the original repo we have over here we have our branch that we did made the changes on and for our request you want to describe what's going on here so I would describe in as much detail as I could uh what's happening uh I could reference issues so in this case I'm probably going to reference um all the issues so that I think there were three issues I found that dealt with the same problem so I'd reference those and I might even mention that user that I got some of these ideas from uh I can't remember the name but I the user I I showed at the beginning and then you would create the pool request and that's pretty much it once you hit correct me if I'm wrong in the live chat but once you do that you hit create pool request then you just wait and see what the uh maintainers are going to say sometimes there are automated tests that happened so you might get immediate feedback if they have an automated test set up in that case like maybe you run it runs the test and it tells you you don't pass the test then maybe you could you know re try to fix it then and resubmit but basically that's it that would be the next step so if you were just here for that and you can't stick around then thank you for watching and uh join join me again sometime um otherwise we're going to try to fix this unrelated problem that just came up sometimes the unrelated problems are fun though uh to fix so let's pull this back on the screen and we'll pull this I'm going to kind of I want to read some of the other things that that happened just to see in myology okay this person said they had to downgrade node so maybe my node version is not out of date maybe it's too new see that I don't really know how to how I can tell this person restarted their computer and it worked wonder if the X Cod I guess I could try the uh the xcode thing oh Patrick says are you using MVM shoot I I don't remember it's been so long since I upgraded note I can't remember what I used to upgrade it last time but I think I did I either used NVM or one of the similar things that NVM does in case you're not familiar with NVM um it's uh B it's it's a way to manage your node versions upgrade versions and uh is it I think nvm's the one that you can have different versions running uh for different projects what's it so try that npm i g no all right let's try I just saw uh xd's comment to try this um mpm I worth a try okay well it did something it added and removed some packages so uh let's see how am I having all right so it is changing package Json kind of I didn't want I change to change package Json but oh well uh that's not what I wanted I wanted seeall run this again and see okay ahed is saying what's what's the speaker's name for uh let me try to go back up okay are you talking about the one that does the uh the math stuff so I know um for free code camps YouTube um if you're talking about the uh tutorial videos for a lot of JavaScript stuff uh B does those on free code camp we do have some other stuff oh okay he is talking about I couldn't figure out if you're talking about Bo or me I'm Jesse so yeah so I do I don't do a lot of tutorial stuff at least for free code Camp uh I am planning on doing some on my own channel but B already does such a great job with tutorials I can't compete with that uh but what I can do is um do some stuff live and sometimes make a fool of myself so that hopefully you all learn something and I get a lot from you all when when I'm working on projects so um so that's why this the show today is is kind of a mess we're having problems but that's the whole point is uh to work through like normal issues that come up as you're doing your your everyday work and did this work I wasn't looking I was looking at the live chat and I think this actually just worked oh okay it says can't find you with with at Jesse wait where are you trying to find me with with at sorry any amage uh in the live chat's asking uh can't find you with at symbol Jesse where I just want to where are you trying to find me at with that if it's in like within the live chat um I'm at free code Camp right now so I'm not I'm not logged in with my um with my account uh right now in the comments to the videos I use my account but in the chat I'm free code Camp all right so it looks like this worked which is awesome so what I'm going to do is I'm going to run the test hopefully that works better than than everything else so far I'm going to run the test and let me know if you think this is a good idea or not but I don't really want to commit the changes made to package Json so I'm not going to commit those I think that would be better cuz I'm I'm not trying to change something like that big to their project I just want my change to be that one thing added that one component so um so that's the plan let me know in the live chat if if you think I should do something else yeah so in case you missed it the command that actually fixed this I mean assuming the other commands I did before that didn't help which who knows I can't really tell at this point uh the command that actually fixed it was this one the one that I'm highlighting here npm ig node uh dyen GP so that fixed it so if you're having a similar problem try that all right now we're going to run I don't I don't even remember what the command was now uh let's see scroll down npm test okay let's run npm test okay I'm only failing one not bad but actually actually um here's the thing I didn't write any tests for my component so of course I should be passing these tests I'm actually surprised that I failed one because I didn't do anything to this so why would it why would that be failing cannot find module Jon uh but at least I can see so what are they using mocha so are using mocha for testing all right so here's what I'm thinking I have two options here well I I'm going to like just for a second ignore the fact that it's actually failing a test and this is just this is not me that's failing the test I didn't change anything in that component so um so for some reason the master branch of this repository is actually failing a test so I don't know how I'm going to be able to uh submit this request without failing something but my other options are this I just submit it without writing tests for that new component or I try to learn mocha in like five minutes and and try to submit something your feedback is greatly appreciated on this I just here's what I'm I'm thinking I kind of just want to take a chance and submit this request without writing the test because it's such a simple pull request and uh the component is really small I don't know that I recommend doing that on projects I mean normally you want to follow everything but uh just because of the fact that I've never written tests for mocha before this is turning into a lot bigger of a a project than I really wanted it to be okay cool so Sebastian says just submit it you're making a new component uh not editing uh one so okay cool I still even if I submit it I'm still a little bit worried about that I'm going to fail just because of of this failing test actually want to check that component out in the test quickly yeah I can't the the odds of me actually writing good tests for this are so low at this point I'm not even like I'm like barely following these already written test so I think I'm just going to submit it and then see what the maintainers say maybe they'll give me some useful feedback and I can make some changes or maybe somebody else will see the pool request and somebody who's good with you know with mocha and and can write that but at the very least the pool request will be there it'll be visible to other people and it could be helpful to somebody else possibly so I don't even know if I should commit any of this stuff because we haven't actually changed anything except the package Json actually let me look I do want to look at this again to see what the build there we go go build I don't think the build really matters at this point because we're I'm not supposed to um commit stuff from D anyway so I'm just going to go ahead with the pull request and I'm going to check the live chat really quick to see what you all think van is is begging for uh subscribers so saying subscribe me please subscribe me please I'll check out your channel um and maybe I'll subscribe from my from my personal account I'm not going to sub subscribe from free code camp but uh I'll check it out all right James says tests are necessary uh James says earlier I think that if you feel that you need a test then it is valid to spend the time maybe they can help you with the error X XD says maybe they can help you with the error all right yeah uh Teemo says uh you could probably copy the tests from a different component and adapt them right yeah maybe I could it seems like I had some suggestion so basically based on what's in the live chat now I have some suggestions that say just just submit the request as is some saying write the test and some saying maybe like submit but ask for for help from the maintainers um let's see how long Okay since this stream has been going on for an hour and 10 minutes at this point what I'm going to do is submit and see what the maintainers say if they want to merge it then great we know Wonderful it'll get merged otherwise if they say I need the test then what I'll do is at some point maybe not tomorrow but at some point in you know the next week or two I'll do a live stream on test so I'll have to learn how to write the test before then but it's probably worthwhile for me to learn that anyway so what I'll do is if I need the test I'll learn how to do it and then I'll write them live on a stream that would be kind of cool to stream anyway I haven't I've never done a stream on on writing test so I think that's the plan does that sound like a good plan okay all right it seems like uh few few people in the live chat are saying that that sounds good all right cool so I think that's the plan I'm going to submit this now um I just need to type add component for tracking and outbound link and opening I don't I don't want window to be cut off I want this all to be on one line and opening in new see if this enough nice okay so that fits all right um I'll just describe a little bit so actually I need to find these let me go to these issues really quick so they were all like right on top so they it shouldn't be too hard to find these three issues all right so that was this one the outbound link one and then this one and I think this one also references another one so I think it was these three so we have 91 71 and 115 shoes let's see all right that's good 115 if I just do hashtag nice uh what was this one what did I say 91 and 71 91 okay 71 yep and 911 all right I'm going to read this back I recommend reading back things that you write if you don't want to mess up so that helps me so uh in regard to issues whatever I created a component that successfully tracks a click on an outbound link and opens that link in a new window or tab all right that sounds good I'm just going to make a little bit a note about the testing uh just to let them know uh what what was going on there uh you I don't know how to write test and MoCA I didn't write any for this new component if this is necessary I'm willing to learn how to write them and submit another Quest all right so how's how's that look uh for everyone watching now I that's pretty straightforward is there anything any other information that probably should be in here or are we good maybe I should include the link to this video so for more information watch how we did this okay cool I see Teemo actually had said just that to mention the uh the test uh in the description so awesome James says you could use grammarly uh in instead of reading that out so yeah actually I've never used that before um but that's probably a good idea maybe I'll do us actually um all right Teo says looks good I actually I kind of do want to include the link to this video now that I think about it because um this might it may have some information that would be useful to the maintainers I mean potentially I don't know what do what do you think I got to see how to um I don't know if there'll be a link ready to use until this video I guess it would be the link would work I'm I'm assuming it's the same link when this video actually uh gets turned into like a recording after I finished it so I'll I'll do that let's see uh let's see actually they need to oops just want to make sure no it didn't work oh okay um actually maybe I should just keep the URL here um okay cool um all right that looks good I'm going to go ahead and uh allow edits for maintainers if you uncheck this box then the maintainers don't have access to edit uh to edit your stuff like you're part of the code uh and some cases maybe you don't want that but in this case I'm fine with with that like maybe they want to go in and write the test or something I I don't know uh but that's fine with me I just I mean I I this react GA has helped me in my project so I just think it'd be cool if I could help you know improve uh react GA just you know a bit and help them out and help everybody out that uses this so all right so I'm going to go ahead and submit this okay ahed did say uh please script the video they may not have time to go through the entire length yeah um yeah I've thought about doing this before I just there's so much some of the videos are really long so it is hard I would love to be able to go in and at least put like a little table contents in where people could skip to head to parts of the videos but I just haven't had time to do it uh that that's probably going to take a long time I mean I think I've done I've done almost 30 videos just for free code camp and I did live streams before that on my own channel so it's a lot of content to go through so I think it's a good idea I just don't have time right now to to do that also it's really weird to hear myself do these videos so I kind of don't like to watch my own videos but um at some point maybe uh you know I'll try to go back and do them maybe some of the videos that get the most traffic it would be worthwhile to do that for all right so now they do have an automated automated system for checking so no conflicts obviously we uh we anticipated that so we didn't change anything that was existing so I don't know how long this check will take it'd be cool to find out what happens while I'm still doing the stream so I'm going to go in at this point uh if if you're not if you haven't watched the show before at the end if I have time I try to go through all the uh live stream questions and answer all your questions so I'm going to go through quickly I have been keeping a pretty good track of what's going on in the live chat so hopefully I didn't miss too many things uh but I'm going to go through and do that so if you were just here for for the actual you know work part of this then uh thanks for watching and um please uh join join in again for another show if you can uh otherwise stick around if you have any questions go ahead and put them in the live chat now uh if you can't stick around for the answer put them in the comments or you can direct message me on Twitter the link to my Twitter account is in the description below actually it looks like I won't be able to get all the way back up to the top of the live chat so it only saves so many messages so it did cut off so sorry if if your message was like really up up high uh then I won't get to it usually that doesn't happen there's uh only a few times have I had that happen that there's so much going on in the live chat that it cuts off so I sorry for that I didn't anticipate that happening uh let's see uh ahed asked do you know any Android live streams actually I don't know any Android live streams so I'm sorry about that uh if anybody that's listen that's watching this later on knows of any Android live streams please put it in the uh in the comments and then maybe uh AED will see that at some point looks like there was a lot of uh good discussion in the live chat so I'm kind of just skipping through a lot of it um ahed ask do you think Android Java iOS are boring uh I don't really know if I'd say like boring for me I just don't know a lot about it uh I I have not that not really a lot of exposure uh to Java and pretty much none at all for developing for iOS uh I did actually once I did pay for and started a course on developing for iOS but I couldn't I couldn't get it to work basically the course wanted you to install some stuff to be I had a Windows computer at the time I didn't have a Mac so I couldn't get it to work so that I could develop it on my Windows computer and it came down to like my uh my CPU like only certain CPUs can handle that so anyway so I got a refund for the course but other than the very small exposure I had then I I don't really know so I can't really comment on it uh whether or not I think it's boring or not because I just haven't worked with it I once went to a class where we uh worked on a game in Java and um I mean it was it was fun uh J jine I'm not sure how to pronounce it it's j a h H uh EI n says why not use Homebrew to keep the stuff updated uh yeah Homebrew if you're on a Mac Homebrew uh is kind of like a package manager type of thing uh Homebrew is cool I I do have some stuff installed with Homebrew I kind of think that I didn't originally install node or anything with with Homebrew so that's why I'm not using it uh but normally yeah with with Homebrew uh it does make it a lot easier to keep things updated okay I see now XD had told me before I even asked he he told me the comment that was his from earlier in the show so uh on the uh on the issues so oh hey I just uh checked it looks like all checks have passed which I mean that was kind of expected uh since we didn't write any new tests so uh evidently the uh issue that we had with uh the code failing one of the tests maybe that was just something maybe the changes that we made in package Json caused that somehow so at least got through here so normally uh if a pull request doesn't pass the automated checks usually it's like rejected automatically uh so this is a good sign it passed these so some one of the maintainers will probably look at it at some point so now all we do is just wait I'll definitely update you all on what happens I mean you could you could check out the repo and everything too but uh so you don't have to keep track of it I will update you whenever I get any uh anything about it so cool I'm going to keep going through the live chat here and see I'm not talking a lot about it because I've already kind of gone through a lot of this stuff while we were while we're doing the video ahed said the moment you said it's going to take time the number abruptly fell to 55 from 67 so you still had the number of viewers so it looks like uh everybody Dro yeah at some point I think I told everybody like you can drop out now if you're not interested in this is just going to take a while and they so they did drop out which is cool I I understand sometimes these videos go really long and uh you know not you just don't have the time not everybody has the time to watch for okay I'm going through uh yeah it looks like I'm almost to the bottom of the uh live chat here so a lot of the stuff was just responses to things earlier that I already uh read out for the most part okay we had uh SJ s Ur r a j says you installed gulp globally uh yeah I did install it globally um um I to be honest I don't use gulp as much as I used to anyway but I think I already had it installed globally I think I did I'm not 100% sure so that's why I just did it globally uh again it's possible that I was mistaken I didn't have it installed globally to begin with but at one time I used gulp for pretty much every project so it made sense for me to install it globally um Ahmed asks are you on LinkedIn uh yeah I am on LinkedIn so if you just look up Jesse wle uh on LinkedIn I am I am there I think I have a link to it so in the description for this video I have a link to my YouTube channel and for my yoube channel YouTube Channel I have links uh to my other social media uh channels so I think the LinkedIn one is is in there uh if you find me on free code or on uh LinkedIn I don't know how many Jesse Wiles there are on LinkedIn but um it's j SS e we i g l so maybe there might be a bunch of them I'm the one that works at Franciscan University and I'm I'm a frontend developer I don't think there are any other Jesse Wiles that are frontend developers on LinkedIn right now uh wizzy 17 asks what language are you using to code um just this is mainly JavaScript but it's it's react uh so it might be it might look a little little bit different uh especially the HTML portion of it but it's basically just JavaScript Okay add a request to show the um show the D I guess that's it I guess just one one check uh it wanted to show the details but I don't unless there's oh yeah details there we go I don't know why I didn't see that all right so let's check out details I'm not sure um s SJ what's your um what you were looking for but uh I mean you could check this out too but it looks like yeah actually I want to see yeah everything passed so we didn't that failing thing uh in outbound link didn't come up again so okay cool uh Ahmed says mobile devices and apps are the new era uh mintra from India shut down their website and continued business only using a mobile app that's cool that's I mean that's interesting I I don't think the web is going anywhere uh right now because it's huge I mean who knows like in time maybe uh but so I mean at least at this point the web is here like it's it's it's pretty steady but I mean who knows things change so it's hard to predict what's going to happen in the future I've also heard people say that apps are going to not be a thing anymore because people just make Progressive web apps that run just as well uh on you know in a browser or on a phone everything so maybe that'll be a thing at some point I mean it already is a thing now but maybe it'll be a reality to where those apps can actually run just as well so I don't know what's going to happen but uh for now I think well as I said said before if if you're trying to choose between web development or developing for apps or anything I would learn react learn react native and then uh you can develop for lots of different things and not have to learn quite as much uh as if you wanted to develop for all those things but wanted to do it you know in Swift and in Java and in um you know in JavaScript or or whatever other even backend languages you would need to know so that's that's my opinion on it I'm not saying it's there there probably other opinions that have good points as well James says I have a game we built in uh seore or C++ it's been a long time it was a nuclear war game that sounds cool I'd like I'd love to build more games in like JavaScript and stuff if I had time I think that it would just be fun and my kids would probably like it it it would help my kids to be more interested in what I do uh XD says you can do apps using react native Ahmed says good suggestion would you help me for this all right cool so XT is actually coding react native now yeah I'm not doing react native yet but like I mentioned before uh at the very beginning so if if you weren't here for the beginning you might have missed it I just signed up and just started today the react course the new react nanodegree course from Udacity and part of that at the end of the course I will be making an app with react native that's that according to the course description it will run on Android and iOS so when I get to that point I will be able to provide help but at this point I probably won't be very helpful for that uh Ahmed says they want to connect on on LinkedIn too yeah if anybody if anybody wants to connect with me on any of the social media channels like I'm I'm cool with that I'll I'll friend you or add you or whatever um you know if if you prefer one channel over another I'm I'm cool with that I'm on everything I'm not really active on everything but um but I'll keep up with like direct messages and things like that now Ahmed said I I was never trying to be rude by talking about the Mobile area during great job yeah Ahmed I I didn't take it uh as being rude so I mean it's totally cool yeah in in general like I don't really get upset with anything anybody says in this chat I mean even I at one point early on I had somebody in here like getting really angry that I was using J query so but I'm cool with it I'm I'm cool with I actually I always expect way more criticism than I really get everybody's been really positive and I know like I know that there are people that are way better than me and I do make a lot of mistakes so uh you all are way nicer than I probably deserve so don't don't feel bad if you have some harsh criticism for me I mean it's always cool if you can say it nicely but even if you can't like I'm I'm okay with that uh wizzy says I'm new in learning to code and I started with python what do you guys think I should learn next uh wizzy it just depends on what you want to do um if you want to do web stuff then you you'll need to learn JavaScript um if you want to do like I don't know like machine learning stuff then from what I understand python is okay uh or like big data like you could probably stick with python and just get deeper into that so uh it's really up to what you what you want to do but you can do a lot with JavaScript nowadays so it's probably a safe thing to learn just in terms of uh being able to get a job you if you know JavaScript you open yourself up to a wide range of jobs um I I don't want to say like more than any other language but it's probably one of the top programming languages uh just in terms of jobs available uh bird person asks do you use Docker for node.js app I have used Docker in the past uh I'm not I don't know it well enough to be comfortable with it for using it for uh for like things that I'm actually making for clients uh or for work uh but I would like to use it more I just haven't taken the time to learn it so um if you know of any good resources for learning Docker uh that's cool I did a plural site course on Docker before uh but yeah I'd definitely like to learn more about it Alberto says your phone started going off right when I got a text from uh my wife yeah it did it was actually my my wife just called and normally I would answer but I think I'm going to end the stream here in just a minute so that's I'm just going to call her back uh I know I know she told me earlier that I have to be home by by 6 so I definitely have time it's only 342 here in in my time zone so I'm not sure what she wanted Ahmed said Jesse I'm relieve you're being positive and sorry about that someone yeah I mean I'm not really upset I don't even remember who the person was that was getting on me about uh jQuery and I was cool with it too like I'm I'm trying to get away from using jQuery as much um the only thing I don't like is if people are getting on each other during the chat uh but if you if you want to say something to me I'm cool with that uh but uh I kind of like to keep it at the the live chat and the comments and everything I like to keep it a place where people can ask questions and not be afraid uh that somebody's going to you know respond with something snarky or mean or something like that so um so yeah that's the only thing that I really uh get upset about and don't like James says I read an article said that programming is the new learning for kids yeah I I definitely agree with that I I've I've read some stuff about that too and I'm education is not usually known for being like on top of things and ahead of the game and really fast at least like especially higher education is super slow uh but I'm surprised surprised that there aren't more schools that are requiring programming like I know at least in the United States a lot of schools require to be able to graduate let's say from high school you have to have so many courses in a foreign language but realistically in the United States if you know English you're fine you'll probably never have to know another language now I know in certain places in the United States Spanish is also spoken a lot but but you can get you know everything that you need to do unless you really want to work in a certain area or a certain industry like you can get away with English so I'm wondering like would it not be more useful to more people if we included programming languages under languages or something like that I mean we uh I just think that we require students to learn things that are way less useful than programming and a lot of these curriculums were made you know years and years ago we've been teaching the same basic concepts uh for so long that it doesn't take into account what's going on today and what what jobs are available today and what the needs are uh for for employees so anyway sorry sorry for that little uh for me getting on my soap box there but um but anyway I I think kids um even in Young young kids should be introduced into basic programming con Concepts uh early on uh Tom asks how important is algorithm scripting uh I would say like for your dayto day work like for me in my daytoday work I rarely ever need to do stuff with algorithms I mean it occasionally I do but if I was looking for a job I would be doing algorithms every day and practicing because you'll probably have to do an algorithm for your uh for your interviews so it there are probably some jobs where algorithms come into play way more often so it might just depend on what you what kind of job you want uh Rich asks do you work for free code camp or do you volunteer I just volunteer I don't I don't get anything for this I don't get any payment I don't even I don't run ads on my personal YouTube channel or anything so um yeah I don't I don't get anything for this ahed says Jess he just talked to her you know that's why I'm not going to get married yeah he was referring to my wife calling actually I should check and see if she texted me it looks like she did text okay she said so she I she told me I needed to be home by 600 but if she saw me earlier at home then she would feed me dinner so so it seems like that's all she wanted which that's that's nice it's good to eat I probably will try to get home before six because I do have a lot of work to do but as as you know I'm I'm definitely into overtime territory so I need to try to leave early at least sometimes to make that up uh um wizzy says in response to Rich's question I'm sorry was says any sites that give projects to work on like a few easy things so I can get the hang of C I don't know I didn't see I guess I didn't see oh okay Rich had a question earlier that I didn't see and it said uh said learn more from working on your own projects than just following a guide okay so I guess I missed a little conversation here about whether it's better to work on a project or follow guides in general you do learn more from working on a project but if you're just starting out in something you sometimes you need the guide first and then you can uh then you can know enough to do the project so it kind of just depends on your level of expertise at least that's that's my been my experience with it uh and Rich says you know think of something yourself um in terms of projects if it's something you're interested in it's a bit easier to stick with so like think of a problem you may face and see if you can solve it I think that's great advice um yeah find something that you are interested in you're way more likely to stick with it so definitely uh really good advice rich sorry I don't know if you guys heard that my stomach just growled was just making noise so I apologize for that if that sounded weird on the on the stream there uh actually I haven't really eaten anything today I just have like um like these weight gain like shakes so basically it's you can drink it but it's a ton of calories and then that way I can just keep working and drink this stuff and I get in my calories so I'm always looking for little ways to be more efficient and get in more coding so I haven't eaten any solid food yet today all right so rich says uh was just Cur this is I guess in response to um so he had asked if I worked for free code camp or I was a volunteer and um I said no I'm a volunteer so he said you are a fulltime Dev though uh how much work would you say you do outside of the office if you don't just work at home yeah so um it depends so I am a fulltime Dev I do work in an office uh but occasionally I have clients on the side that I do work for and so it just depends on if I have a client and what the client is so I do have some steady clients that I do really minor work for like every month and I wouldn't even call it programming work it's really like uploading blog post to Wordpress I don't really like to do that work but it's more like it's almost like a favor you know it's like some local nonprofits that I do things for um one of the nonprofits my great aunt is on the board for so it's kind of a favor to her and the other one is like a family friend runs this nonprofit so um so I charge them like a really really low rate compared to what I would charge like a real company uh and I do the work so it's just really basic stuff occasionally I do get a client that I I have I do like a legit site for and then sometimes I work a lot outside so I might there have been times when I would put in like an extra 30 or 40 hours a week on top of my normal fulltime job to get a site launch for a client that now that's only probably a few weeks out of the year that I would work like that and I don't like to work like that if I can avoid it uh so but it just varies uh garv asks what's the best JavaScript framework to start with honestly here's what I'm G this is going to be unpopular but I'll give two answers I'm going to say what the easiest one to start with is and then I'll say what the best one to start with so I mean assuming that you've already learned some just regular JavaScript which is would be good to start with I would say the best framework in my opinion to learn would be react simply because there are so many react jobs available now it seems to be in really high demand I found react to be easier to pick up than angular was I I tried and failed at angular when it back when it was angular version one so I don't know about the newer versions maybe it's easier but I had trouble with it at first so I would say react if you want to know the easiest framework to use than it's jQuery and don't don't everybody hate me for that but realistically there are still a lot of jobs out there and a lot of places that use jQuery so it seems like it's not popular to use among devs but among actual websites that are out there it's very prevalent so those sites still need people to work on them so if if you're looking for something to get into that's easy to understand then I mean people should know some jQuery it's not that hard to pick up but if you're taking on clients like random clients and businesses like you're going to have to do something with jQuery at some point so uh you may as well I guess learn that at first just don't use it for everything you know try to learn how to do it the regular JavaScript way try to learn how to do it in react or if you want to go with angular try to do it in that so uh it's easy to just you kind of use jQuery as a CR for everything and then when you have to do something without it it's really hard uh Ahmed says I wrote a Blog on using git it's on LinkedIn please comment on it once you connect with me so yeah I definitely will Amed and if anybody else uh you know check out amed's blog on on LinkedIn uh it's about using git so if you want to if you need some help using git check that out wizzy said I guess your stomach wants to reach home before 6'2 yeah ammed says I was once like you not eating food but having fun coding only to realize after seven years that it's an unending story yeah it's true like I probably should I probably should eat more like I legit at one point I lost so much weight because I was just coating and not eating that my clothes didn't fit anymore I had to buy new clothes uh so I actually used an app I used my fitness pile to track my calories so I remembered to eat and then I did gain some weight but now I I I didn't I got a new phone and I never installed that app again so now I'm back back down to um not fitting in my clothes anymore uh Rich says thanks for answering I ask as I see another FCC video FCC being free code Camp a day at Amazon it's seemed he worked at home a lot as well as in the office yeah I um I do some work at home like for this job that I at the University that's my normal fulltime job I do work from home sometimes I'm not like I'm supposed to work here in the office fulltime right so but if I don't feel well I'm I work from home uh just to like not get anybody else uh sick in in my office so that's when I can work from home I would like to be allowed to do more work from home so that's something I'm probably going to negotiate um possibly uh I'm possibly thinking like at some point you know when it would be time that maybe maybe I could negotiate to be able to work from home instead of like a bump up in salary like maybe if there's a time when financially it's just not possible for my department to give the arrays or anything then that would be a good time to try to say like hey well how about you know I can do some remote work instead which would be which would be nice I mean it you don't I don't have to drive in to work I don't have to spend time you know getting them dressed up and ready I can just you know sit at home uh and and do the work from there so that's kind of my plan I would like to do more work from home although it it's kind of hard though if the kids are there uh sometimes times it's distracting but if the kids aren't home I get a lot more work done at home than I do in the office uh because in the office people could just walk by and you know talk to me about things like if I have to go stop somewhere I always run into people on the way and and like every little errand at work takes way longer uh rudaki says Jesse what do you do to not forget the things you've learned I've heard some devs use space repetition software like anky is that common in the community I actually I read about Anie and I downloaded an app for it and then I never used it for me to remember the things that I've learned the best way for me is to keep using them in projects uh so there's definitely something to be said like it let's say that you're you're practicing for an interview and you know certain questions are going to be on there then using something like anky would probably be beneficial but otherwise just doing the work will force you to remember it you know you you'll start remembering things that functions that you use constantly syntax that you use constantly or commands on you know terminal commands that you use constantly you'll remember it at first you'll have to look it up but at some point you won't have to look it up anymore and you'll remember it naturally I like that way of doing things because you know you're actually getting work done while you're doing it and to me that's kind of a more natural way like that that's how kids that's how babies pick things up you know they don't learn with like flat flash right you don't do flashcards with a baby to teach them how to how to talk they pick it up by hearing what you say and trying to mimic that so to me I think that's a much more natural way of doing things and it it works for me uh but so you know people have different methods of learning so what works for me might not work you know for you or for someone else so uh but I do think if if you do have certain things that you know you will have to memorize and you need to know it quickly then something like anky uh which is like a space repetition of the same uh knowledge the same information would be beneficial in that case I just don't really ever have a case like that uh in for what I do uh if you were still in school like that would definitely work for test though uh ammed says Jesse man so many hours after regular job I should start drinking the energy drink you mentioned yeah so uh here's my unofficial commercial for my energy drink that I I don't I don't get paid to sponsor or do anything at all but I I drink gfuel and uh I'm not a doctor so don't take my word for it but it's basically if you ever used 5H Hour Energy it basically is the same stuff that's in 5our energy except it's in powdered form so it's cheaper and you can get it shipped to you cheaper and you mix it with water so anyway they Market it to like professional Gamers but I find that it does help me out for uh for my coating so uh and I like it better like Red Bull and stuff that those energy drinks have a lot of sugar and things in them and this doesn't have a ton of sugar in it so it's it is it's better for you in that sense that it's not filled with sugar if you do use gu I recommend getting one of the flavors that has some type of citrus in it the stuff without Citrus for me is just too sweet you need that like little tanginess from the Citrus to cut the sweetness uh Justin says I guess it just it depends on what your initial struggle with angularjs was a lot has changed now they're on version 4 but moved to an evergreen naming convention yeah that's what I thought Justin I I expect that there are two problems with my early experience with angular one I just wasn't that good with JavaScript period at the time like this was years ago when angular was somewhat new and I just didn't have the experience if I tried to learn it again now I'm sure I would be way more successful uh also angular has has come a long way since then as well so my opinion on angular is probably not that that great I don't trust it too much because when I talk about angular I'm talking about angular one and I'm talking about a version of me that was way less skilled at JavaScript uh Justin says Pomodoro Timer man yeah I I do use Pomodoro timers so I got my pomodora timer up right now I was just using it using it for work earlier uh the problem is when I have that like five minute break between Pomodoro sessions I usually check email and stuff and so I don't get I don't get time to do anything else uh ahed says Jesse please join a gym in that case you can't stop eating and your clothes will fit to yeah I need to uh I need to start working out again I've been really busy with work and I've put that off so uh I need I found like if I don't work out my uh my mental health just is is really bad so like not only physically but like mentally I just get way more like depressed maybe that's why the guy that left earlier said I sounded bored maybe I I just need to work out maybe I'm getting depressed uh but yeah it it helps me mentally I'm way more positive and upbeat it actually makes it easier for me to figure out problems that with when I'm coding so uh I I know what I need to do it's just a matter of of doing it and having the willpower to do it uh amed's ask saying for react do you know some site to start with I don't want to go through the videos now just some quality uh reads would make more sense um react trying to think I think uh code academy has some react stuff like intro to react tutorial stuff um it's not like just reading it's you know you're doing the exercises but that's like a good place to start and then the react documentation itself is not really that hard to read through uh let's see Alberto says in terms of energy drinks that he drinks some green tea thing forget what it's called though but it's it is carbonated um yeah I've tried green tea before I actually have green tea pills uh so I found like they just they don't work that much they don't give you that energy so I have uh my brotherinlaw he does um he like sells tickets online for things buys and sells them and he does stuff in the stock market and he uses green tea pills they work for him but for me I just I haven't had that much luck with him but I really do like to actually drink green tea just for pleasure and not for energy James says I wish I could gain weight actually I was successful I gained like 25 lbs I know this has nothing to do with coding sorry to anybody that I'm getting off track here but just for like 30 seconds I'm going to tell you how I managed to gain like 25 PBS in just like two or three months um so I downloaded the uh My Fitness Pal app and I set a Target goal a weight goal right and then it it helps you figure out how many calories you need to take in so I didn't have to do all that math they did it for me then I had like the weight gain shakes that would give me a lot of um I don't remember what they're called I get them from Amazon subscribe and save and so every month I just get these big bags of like weight gain uh powder right you just mix it with milk and just a lot of protein and a lot of stuff so basically I would just keep track of what I was eating every day to make sure I hit that calorie goal then I also made sure that I worked out so every day like after work I'd come in I come in through my basement door I have like all my clothes and stuff are down in the basement by the washing machine so I change out of my work clothes right there before I do anything else and then I had a little weight set and a weight bench right next to the laundry room so I'd go right from changing out of my work clothes right to there I'd do like a little work just like a 15minute workout tried to just lift like the heaviest weights I could and uh then I would go upstairs and see my family and that way like I always got it in and immediately after that I'd go upstairs and eat eat dinner so I'd get some calories in right away I did that consistently for like two or three months and I was able to gain that weight and it was basically like mostly muscle weight I mean I uh I would do some cardio uh as well and that was M basically for mental health because if you do like 45 minutes of cardio every day uh it does help your your mood a lot like you know in your mental health so that was my how I did it it honestly just takes discipline to be able to eat the amount of calories and to keep doing the workouts uh Alberto says I I'm in a a pretty noncode intensive day day job so spend for like from 730 a.m. to 400 p.m. doing mostly admin type work but then go home do some yoga and work on a web project in net uh until whatever sometime in the am in the next morning uh that's pretty uh that's pretty tough schedule too going home and working on projects at night that's like I'm uh I'm impressed by that because I I know that's it's tough like it's tough to have the energy and the motivation at the end of the day after you've already worked uh Hubert says uh where's the coding sorry just join 10 minutes ago yeah we're doing the question and answer stuff so we kind of got away from coding and we we were getting into nutrition for coders I guess um but yeah I'm actually going to wrap up the live chat here in a few minutes but the uh video of the code portion of it and everything will be available about a minute or two after I wrap up so you can check out the uh the recording uh Rich says I'm a student will hopefully graduate in three months time at the age of 32 any advice as I Look to get into the industry with no experience of working in this area uh manual work previously um so I would say uh work on projects and that's Amed is giving the same advice here um yeah work on projects so if you don't already have projects that you're working on uh get some uh like contribute to other people's open Source projects on GitHub uh and that'll that'll show employers that you can do the work and that you're passionate about the coding and what you do because if you're taking time where you're not even getting paid to work on this obvious viously like this is something you you like to do uh so I would do that and then try to get until you find fulltime work try to get some clients uh you know freelancing so I maybe start out in your local area to try to get some if you really can't find it you can go on some of the freelancing sites I haven't had much luck with that you probably won't make very much money but if you just need some work you know it's not a bad place to go uh so and then just keep you know keep learning and if you have to take a job that's not coding related to pay the bills then you know that's that's cool too uh just make sure that you always like try to keep uh keep coding oh James said I had to have my colon removed sorry to hear that James I hope uh I hope everything's healing up well and uh and properly I know my wife went through major surgery uh in like beginning in November so uh I know that can be really tough to recover from I know even now she's still having complications from the surgery so uh good good luck with that Umberto says uh need a software Dev day job said then the evenings would be all about my wife and me she's been super understanding about my craving to code that's awesome that's really important if um you know you have your family's understanding about things and it's important to spend time with family too and I mean I I say that knowing that I don't always spend as much time with my family as I should uh because you just get into the work uh you know there's deadlines things need to get done so don't forget that though I mean the work will always be there but your family might not you know even like your kids grow up you know they leave at some point your kids don't want to hang out with you anymore so uh and I'm I'm saying this I I need to take my own advice so I'm saying this to myself as well Amed says sorry to hear about your wife Jesse take care of her yeah I mean she's she's doing good now to the point like there's just some weird complications and stuff going on from her surgery so um the the worst part is I don't want to get like super personal so I don't want to weird anybody out but like the worst part is for us like she's she's not able to have kids anymore and that was like unexpected uh you know we had we had thought that we'd be able to have more kids we're really young like I'm only 31 uh so uh kind of expected to have more years of kids so that's kind of the for me at least that's like the really the toughest part and then for my wife still having like pain and things going on so uh she's just been doing physical therapy and and seeing a lot of doctors and stuff but hopefully uh she's one of her doctors has her on this new like nutrition plan and physical therapy and stuff so we're hoping that that'll work work out and help her okay cool and I've reached the end of the live chat so that I kind of ended on like a down note so I didn't intend to but then I just reached the end of the chat so uh thanks um for all the support I have some people in the live chat giving some messages of support for for me and for my wife and uh I really appreciate that um thank thank you for that oh James says there are a lot of kids out there that need to be adopted that's always a good alternative yeah you're right James that's true I I did look into uh my my oldest son is seven and he was asking me about adopting kids uh a few weeks back and so I checked out I checked into it right now it actually costs a lot of money to adopt um at least to adopt like babies and stuff so it's a little bit out of my range right now now but hopefully in the future I'll be at a place financially where that's possible and uh yeah I mean I I love I love babies I love kids I love having kids around so I'm definitely open to um to adopting uh one day at some point I think if I can always have a little kid like or want to come home to I'll be I'll be fine no matter what happens at work if you can come home and there's a little one there you know and they just want to give you hug and uh that just it just like wipes away all the nonsense that happened that day and all the stress and everything so uh I'll be sad when I don't have that anymore okay you're welcome yeah I have some people saying thanks for your time you're welcome everybody and uh on that note I I am going to wrap this up because this video ended up being really really long um so um yeah oh um I think I got I think I answered everybody's questions if I missed something you know send me a message on Twitter or uh put it in the comments below and uh I'll I'll try to give you an answer and sorry if I missed missed your question uh I should be back there's going to be at least one day this week where I'm going to have to change I'm either I either won't be able to stream or I'll have to change the stream time um I don't know where I have my C here's my calendar I just want to check real quick okay so tomorrow I should be good same time streaming but Thursday is going to have to be a different time because I'm going to have a long meeting around 1 I might be able to get out of the meeting earlier but I I don't want to schedule anything and then have to cancel so uh Thursday might be an off time uh for the stream and then Friday I should be good at the normal time so oh uh my Twitter handle is uh someone asked about my Twitter handle it's it's in the description uh for this video so just check check below and there should be a link to it all right so thank you so much uh for for watching and especially if you stuck around for this super long video and thanks for I talked a lot about like noncode related stuff so thanks for for listening uh through all of that and you all have been really great and uh really helpful when I had all those errors and things come up so I really appreciate that uh the video was somewhat less instructional than I had hoped just because of some of the errors and stuff um so hopefully you did get something out of it if you've never submitted a pool request before uh but I'll be back tomorrow and uh hopefully I'll maybe we can have some uh good news about the pool request maybe it's it'll be accepted uh but uh have have a great day uh I'll see yall tomorrow
