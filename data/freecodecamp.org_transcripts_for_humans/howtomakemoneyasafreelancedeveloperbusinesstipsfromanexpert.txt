00:07 - hi my name is Luke Siciliano and I'm a
00:09 - web
00:10 - developer this is going to be a
00:11 - four-part discussion on how you can make
00:14 - money as a freelancer this is a really
00:16 - important topic to talk about because a
00:18 - lot of people who are just finishing
00:19 - free code camp are wondering what am I
00:21 - going to do now I finish the certificate
00:23 - program am I going to go out in three
00:25 - lanced am I going to get a job if I'm
00:27 - going to start a business it's
00:28 - understandable that people have been so
00:30 - focused on their education that now they
00:32 - might be a little nervous about
00:33 - wondering what they're gonna do with
00:35 - that education so in this discussion
00:37 - we're going to look at the option of
00:39 - being a freelance developer okay now
00:42 - we're going to look at four things
00:44 - number one is should you be a freelancer
00:47 - at all because obviously if freelance
00:50 - work isn't a good fit for you personally
00:51 - then you don't need to know anything
00:54 - else about it number two we're going to
00:56 - look at how to make yourself stand out
00:58 - from other freelance developers number
01:00 - three is going to be how to sell your
01:02 - services because selling is something a
01:05 - lot of people just aren't comfortable
01:06 - with and number four after we've talked
01:09 - about how to sell your services we'll
01:10 - talk about where to take those
01:11 - salesmanship skills and to sell your
01:14 - services and who you're gonna how who
01:15 - you're going to reach out to how you're
01:17 - going to reach out to them so on and so
01:19 - forth and I think after getting over
01:21 - going over those four things you'll have
01:23 - a basic understanding of do I want to be
01:27 - a freelancer and if so this is a good
01:29 - here's how I'm gonna go down that path
01:30 - and earn a living doing it well let's
01:33 - start with the most important question
01:35 - and that is should you be a freelance
01:36 - developer at all because obviously if
01:39 - you don't have the personality type for
01:40 - it then you don't need any of the other
01:42 - information right when asking the
01:45 - question should I be a freelance
01:47 - developer you really got to break that
01:48 - question down into two parts number one
01:51 - is a good fit for your personality and
01:53 - number two can you make money doing it
01:55 - because if it's not a good fit for you
01:58 - then you're probably destined to fail at
02:00 - it and if it is a good fit for you then
02:03 - you're probably a good chance of
02:04 - succeeding at it the second part of that
02:06 - can you make money doing it is really
02:09 - important right because if you can't
02:10 - make a living doing this why would you
02:12 - do it so let's start with the question
02:14 - of should you and look at your
02:17 - personality type and say are you good
02:19 - fit for freelance work when you're
02:21 - saying am i a good fit for freelance
02:23 - work you really
02:23 - need to ask yourself are you a social
02:25 - self-motivated individual or you someone
02:28 - who needs structure provided to you
02:30 - here's what I mean by that when you're
02:33 - doing freelance work you're going to
02:35 - really be your own self regulating boss
02:38 - you're gonna be the one to make sure
02:40 - that you start work at a certain time
02:42 - every day that you work through a
02:44 - certain time every day a lot of times
02:46 - you're gonna be working from home so you
02:48 - need to be able to filter out
02:49 - distractions you need to be able to
02:52 - impose deadlines upon yourself and have
02:54 - a certain sense of discipline so if
02:57 - you're very self-motivated and self
02:59 - disciplined then freelance work might be
03:02 - a good fit for you because no one's
03:04 - gonna be imposing that structure on you
03:07 - all right now if you're someone who
03:10 - needs a certain structure in your life
03:12 - in other words you need a boss telling
03:14 - you you have to beat your desk by 8:30
03:16 - every morning you need to be told when
03:18 - assignments are due by because if you're
03:20 - not told when they're due by you might
03:21 - just put them off put them off put them
03:23 - off if you're easily distracted you're
03:27 - someone who is probably I need that
03:28 - structure provided for you by an
03:30 - employer a lot of times when you're a
03:32 - freelancer for example you're going to
03:34 - be working at home and you know you're
03:36 - working at home the doorbell rings you
03:38 - answer it sign for your package from
03:40 - Amazon and now you're distracted you
03:43 - can't get yourself back to work if
03:45 - that's your personality type then you
03:47 - need structure provided for you in other
03:49 - words you need a boss you need that
03:51 - company that's going to tell you here's
03:53 - when things are due here's when to be
03:55 - here so on so forth and if that's your
03:58 - personality type you're probably better
04:00 - off being an employee versus the person
04:03 - who's self-motivated and self
04:04 - disciplined who is probably better off
04:06 - being a freelance developer and being
04:08 - their own boss now if you're someone who
04:11 - needs that structure provided for you
04:12 - there's nothing wrong with that there
04:14 - are a lot of really successful people in
04:17 - the world who aren't self employed
04:18 - aren't freelancers and they just need to
04:20 - work within a structure but when they're
04:22 - in that environment they really excel at
04:23 - it so if this isn't for you and you're
04:26 - saying well I need structure don't feel
04:28 - bad about that it just means that
04:29 - freelance work is right for you it means
04:31 - you should probably be working for
04:33 - somebody instead that being said if
04:35 - you're that self-motivated individual
04:37 - you would probably be frustrated working
04:39 - in a really structured job because you
04:43 - know you don't need someone telling you
04:45 - when to get things done and so on so for
04:47 - if you can work independently and people
04:49 - that can work independently tend to
04:50 - Excel a little bit more in environments
04:52 - where they're their own boss
04:54 - so really ask yourself are you a
04:55 - self-motivated self disciplined
04:57 - individual or do you need structure
04:58 - provided for you if it's the former
05:01 - freelance work is probably a good fit
05:03 - for you now the next question is
05:06 - assuming I have the personality type to
05:08 - be a freelance developer can I make
05:10 - money doing this because again need to
05:12 - make a living right gotta pay the bills
05:13 - I would answer yes you can make money as
05:17 - a freelance developer and I would
05:19 - actually argue that for freelancers
05:21 - there's a market out there of twenty one
05:23 - point six billion dollars you can tap
05:25 - into it's a lot of numbers I'm gonna say
05:27 - again twenty one point six billion I
05:29 - would have written out all the zeros but
05:31 - I'm quite lazy and I don't like to write
05:32 - that much how do I come up with this
05:35 - number that there's a twenty one almost
05:36 - twenty two billion dollar market for you
05:39 - to tap into I'll break this down there's
05:42 - roughly twenty four million small
05:45 - businesses in the United States I that
05:48 - I'm talking about the local bakery local
05:50 - pizza shop local bar local hair salon
05:53 - local fitness studio you name it just
05:56 - start naming businesses all right
05:58 - roughly twenty four million of them
06:01 - roughly thirty percent twenty nine
06:04 - percent but will rounded up to thirty
06:05 - roughly thirty percent of those small
06:07 - businesses in 2017 either don't have a
06:10 - website or have one that is drastically
06:12 - out-of-date it might not be
06:13 - mobile-friendly something of that nature
06:16 - may sound inconceivable to us as tech
06:20 - people that how can thirty percent of
06:23 - small businesses not have a website it's
06:25 - true
06:25 - so if thirty percent of small businesses
06:28 - need web work done and there's 24
06:32 - million small businesses that's 7.2
06:34 - million small businesses in the country
06:37 - that need that kind of work now let's
06:39 - say you would charge the average small
06:41 - business $3,000 for any website that's
06:43 - probably a really low number but for the
06:46 - purpose of this discussion let's go with
06:48 - it
06:48 - if you charge $3,000 for
06:51 - the average website and there's 7.2
06:54 - million small businesses that need that
06:56 - service 7.2 million times $3,000 is 21
07:01 - billion 600 million so that's how I come
07:03 - up with the number that there's a market
07:05 - out there of 21 billion 600 million
07:07 - dollars out there for you to cap in tap
07:09 - into last time I checked that's a lot of
07:13 - money okay and if you do some of the
07:15 - things we're going to talk about a
07:16 - little later in this video I think you
07:18 - can tap into this effectively so that
07:22 - being said there's a big market you can
07:23 - make a lot of money this number probably
07:26 - actually underestimates the opportunity
07:29 - out there and the reason I say that is
07:31 - that's assuming you're just building a
07:33 - relatively cheap website for those small
07:35 - businesses what if you're building a
07:37 - website for the local pizza pizza shop
07:39 - and they want a mobile app or something
07:41 - on top of it you might charge them more
07:42 - than the $3,000 so big market you can
07:46 - make a lot of money doing this so on the
07:49 - question of should you be a freelancer
07:52 - ask yourself are you self-motivated or
07:54 - do you need structure provided for you
07:56 - if you're a self-motivated individual
07:58 - this is for you if you need the
08:00 - structure that job provides not for you
08:03 - can you make money doing this
08:04 - make a lot of money doing this so ask
08:08 - yourself those questions look at it in
08:10 - those terms and say is this for me if it
08:13 - is keep on watching in the next part of
08:16 - the video we're going to talk about how
08:17 - to make yourself stand out from other
08:18 - freelance developers
08:28 - okay we're back for part two in our
08:30 - discussion of how to make money as a
08:33 - freelance developer and since you're
08:35 - still watching that means you've decided
08:37 - that freelancing is potentially for you
08:39 - and you want to know how to go about
08:40 - building a business as a freelancer so
08:43 - in this part of the video we're going to
08:45 - talk about how to make your services
08:46 - stand out a little bit against those of
08:49 - other freelancers so you can make a good
08:51 - living and not just be part of the pack
08:53 - and then we'll go on to how to sell your
08:55 - services properly and you'll see that
08:57 - this part of the video will wrap into
08:58 - the next part in a little bit but this
09:00 - has some important discussions that we
09:03 - need to have before we talk about how to
09:05 - actually sell your services and since
09:08 - you've already watched the first part of
09:09 - the video you have figured out my
09:10 - handwriting is terrible
09:12 - good a lot of things writing is not one
09:14 - of them
09:15 - sorry so let's talk about how to make
09:20 - yourself stand out from other developers
09:23 - though now this is an important topic to
09:26 - have a discussion on the reason for that
09:30 - is I feel there's a very big disconnect
09:34 - between the development community and
09:36 - the people who would consume the
09:38 - services of the developers mainly small
09:40 - businesses here's why I say there's a
09:43 - disconnect as I said in as I said in the
09:48 - last part of my video there's roughly
09:50 - thirty percent of small businesses don't
09:53 - have a quality website in 2017 so this
09:57 - is those businesses right here if you go
10:00 - onto google and just do a search in your
10:02 - local city for you know name of my city
10:06 - website builder you will find an
10:08 - abundance of people ready to build
10:10 - websites for these businesses just in
10:12 - your town okay so if you've got this
10:14 - huge pool of potential customers and
10:16 - you've got this abundance of labor ready
10:19 - to do the work that these people need
10:20 - you have to ask why isn't this work
10:23 - getting done right because again lots of
10:26 - work lots of people to do it but somehow
10:28 - these services aren't getting sold in
10:30 - other words there is a disconnect these
10:32 - developers are not connecting with these
10:34 - potential customers in a way that makes
10:36 - these potential customers say I want to
10:38 - buy that service so if you really want
10:41 - to make yourself stand out as
10:42 - freelancer you've got to bridge this gap
10:44 - otherwise you're just gonna be one of
10:46 - these developers stuck over here
10:47 - wondering why can't I get this business
10:49 - why can't I get this business so let's
10:52 - really fast look at how you're gonna
10:53 - bridge this and the biggest step to
10:56 - bridging that and I'll explain what I
10:58 - mean by this but it's to understand that
11:01 - once you become a freelancer you're not
11:03 - a developer you're not a coder you're
11:05 - not a programmer you're not an app
11:07 - builder you're not oh whatever you want
11:09 - to call itself you are a problem solver
11:11 - okay you're a problem solver and here's
11:14 - what I mean by that let's say I'm the
11:18 - potential small business customer I'm a
11:19 - local pizza shop I don't have a website
11:22 - I want a website so that potential
11:26 - customers can order food online
11:27 - I want a website so that someone who's
11:30 - never been to my pizza shop before can
11:32 - look at photos of my dining room see how
11:34 - nice it is see how nice my bar is when
11:37 - they see those pictures maybe they'll
11:38 - come into my restaurant right that's all
11:42 - I care about
11:42 - I care about getting those needs met and
11:44 - that's it but here when I'm sitting here
11:48 - with those needs
11:49 - the average developer sitting over here
11:51 - going I'll build your website using the
11:55 - latest CMS I will build your website
11:56 - writing my own HTML
11:58 - I know CSS I know PHP I'm really good
12:02 - with JavaScript so on so forth this
12:05 - person this small business owner doesn't
12:06 - even know what any of that stuff means
12:08 - first of all and when someone's going I
12:10 - use a CMS or I will write it in HTML
12:13 - instead using a CMS this person over
12:15 - here is gonna say well okay but explain
12:20 - to me how that solves my problem all
12:22 - right
12:22 - so really these developers are talking a
12:25 - they're talking past the potential
12:27 - customers and they're talking over the
12:29 - heads of the potential customers okay so
12:31 - what you need to do is identify the
12:33 - problems of that small business let's
12:36 - stick with the pizza shop example that's
12:38 - where the developer should say tell me a
12:41 - little bit about your needs I would like
12:43 - a website okay and then the developer
12:46 - can ask questions understand what it is
12:48 - that the customer is trying to get from
12:51 - that website and then the developer can
12:54 - propose solutions to meet those problems
12:56 - so in other words it's important for the
12:58 - developer to be an active listener and
13:00 - then propose a solution based on that
13:02 - active listening this is a really big
13:05 - contrast to the experience you'll have
13:08 - if you go onto Google and as I said look
13:10 - for developers in your local area
13:12 - because again you'll see the local
13:15 - developer who's got his own website
13:17 - talks about his coding skills again if
13:21 - you're the small business owner all that
13:23 - talk about coding skills doesn't talk
13:26 - about meeting your problems in meeting
13:28 - your needs when they smile
13:31 - businessperson talks that developer on
13:32 - the phone that developer a lot of times
13:34 - it's just going to talk about code and
13:36 - technical jargon that a small business
13:38 - owners understand again everything I'm a
13:41 - small business owner right here
13:42 - everything I've just heard from that guy
13:43 - isn't speaking to my needs so I'm
13:47 - probably gonna call somebody else so
13:49 - what you really need to do is understand
13:51 - you're not a coder you're a problem
13:53 - solver you need to make an important
13:55 - part of your job identifying the
13:57 - problems of the customer and then
13:59 - proposing a solution to meet those
14:00 - problems if you do that you bridge this
14:04 - disconnect and while all these
14:06 - developers are stuck over here wondering
14:08 - how they get business you're crossing
14:10 - this bridge and you're tapping into
14:11 - these roughly 7.2 million small
14:13 - businesses that don't have a website or
14:16 - need a website in 2017 and that's how
14:19 - you're gonna make a lot of money now
14:21 - this concept is going to get wrapped a
14:24 - little bit into the next part of our
14:25 - discussion on how to best sell your
14:27 - services it's very very important that
14:30 - you recognize that there's this
14:32 - disconnect out there between the
14:34 - development community and the people
14:35 - that need those services and that you
14:37 - can bridge that disconnect by making
14:39 - yourself a problem solver understand
14:40 - these things and you'll really make
14:42 - yourself stand out so all that being
14:45 - said let's apply some of this to how to
14:48 - sell your services
14:58 - okay we're back for part three in our
14:59 - video discussion on how to make money as
15:01 - a freelance developer we just looked at
15:03 - how to make yourself stand out a little
15:05 - bit from the crowd and how to really
15:09 - make yourself a good business person as
15:11 - opposed to a lot of the freelancers that
15:13 - are just kind of skating by and that is
15:15 - by understanding and solving your
15:17 - customers problems as opposed to wanting
15:20 - to just say I'm a developer I write code
15:22 - alright making yourself a problem
15:23 - solvers how you make yourself stand out
15:26 - in this part of the video we're going to
15:28 - talk about how to sell your services
15:30 - which is something a lot of people
15:32 - aren't comfortable with and you're going
15:33 - to see what we just talked about about
15:35 - being a problem solver really rolls into
15:38 - selling your services effectively before
15:41 - we talk about how to sell your services
15:43 - there's one thing I want to get out of
15:45 - the way and that is that I understand a
15:48 - lot of people aren't comfortable selling
15:50 - a lot of people aren't comfortable
15:52 - talking about themselves talking up
15:54 - their services dealing with other people
15:56 - in a sales kind of way well two things
16:00 - to that number one is some people this
16:04 - comes naturally to some people it
16:06 - doesn't but everybody can be good at it
16:08 - sales are something that if you're
16:10 - willing to get outside of your comfort
16:11 - zone a little bit and work on it and
16:13 - practice and give it an effort you can
16:16 - get good at it even if you're not
16:17 - necessarily the most comfortable with it
16:19 - right now
16:20 - so the selling your services is
16:23 - something you can do I can't stress that
16:25 - enough you can sell your services even
16:27 - if you feel uncomfortable with it the
16:30 - second thing I want to mention real fast
16:31 - is that you don't have a choice if you
16:34 - want to be a freelance developer if
16:36 - you're not good at selling your services
16:38 - or I should say if you don't make an
16:39 - effort at being good at selling your
16:41 - services you're going to go broke
16:43 - because you're not going to have any
16:44 - customers ok so again you can do this
16:49 - you can sell trust me I've seen lots of
16:52 - people who initially were uncomfortable
16:54 - selling that over time and do me anytime
16:56 - got good at it
16:58 - so all that being said let's talk about
17:01 - how to go about selling your services
17:04 - which is something a lot of people are
17:06 - really unsure of how to do and this
17:09 - really comes down to
17:11 - a couple of things really the initial
17:14 - meeting with a potential customer will
17:16 - talk about that we'll talk about putting
17:18 - together a proposal for that potential
17:20 - customer and we'll talk about closing
17:22 - that deal and a lot of times this will
17:24 - all essentially be within one
17:27 - conversation so you know might span a
17:30 - couple but typically you're looking at
17:32 - one so the first thing is the initial
17:36 - meeting this might be a meeting it
17:38 - wherever you're working if you have an
17:40 - office a lot of times you gonna be
17:41 - working on this will probably be over
17:42 - the telephone potential customers going
17:46 - to call you this is your chance to make
17:48 - yourself a problem solver like we just
17:50 - talked about we're gonna stick with the
17:52 - local pizza shop on our example example
17:55 - and you've got to use this initial
17:58 - contact with a potential client to
18:00 - identify the potential clients problem
18:03 - so you can help the client understand
18:04 - how you're going to solve those problems
18:05 - so let's say again I'm a local pizza
18:09 - shop owner I call you your web developer
18:14 - typical web developer in my experience
18:17 - the typical web developer might say
18:19 - something along the lines of okay what
18:23 - kind of business is it okay it's a pizza
18:24 - shop do you need online ordering okay do
18:28 - you need online reservations okay
18:30 - anything else about your business all
18:33 - right well let me give you a quote well
18:35 - that doesn't really do a lot to
18:37 - understand the customers business if you
18:40 - take the steps to understand the
18:42 - customers business you can identify the
18:44 - problems and by identifying the problems
18:46 - you do a lot better so let's look at how
18:49 - this should go okay the developers
18:52 - talking to the pizza shop owner okay
18:53 - you're a pizza shop owner are you dying
18:57 - in only or you carryout only or do you
18:59 - have a dine in business okay you have a
19:01 - significant dining business so where is
19:06 - your customer base is it just a local
19:08 - neighborhood around you oh you're right
19:10 - by a university as well so you sell with
19:13 - a lot of college sell them a lot of
19:15 - college kids and not just you know like
19:17 - residential areas okay
19:20 - would your customers prefer to order
19:22 - online is that something you've
19:24 - experimented with do you have a bar in
19:26 - your establishment or is it just a pizza
19:28 - shop itself what are your goals what are
19:31 - your goals as a you know business do you
19:34 - want to grow to multiple locations so on
19:37 - and so forth by asking those kinds of
19:38 - questions you really start to understand
19:40 - what it is this business wants to
19:43 - accomplish right oh you're a business
19:45 - you have a significant business with a
19:47 - significant dying in business as well as
19:49 - a takeout business we're going to need a
19:52 - photo gallery that showcases showcases
19:56 - your dining in experience we might wanna
19:58 - get some professional photographs taken
20:00 - that shown people eating having a good
20:02 - time feature the waitstaff so on so
20:04 - forth oh you've got a bar you know we
20:07 - should make sure we feature the bar as
20:08 - well you are right by a college well you
20:12 - know a lot of younger people are
20:13 - probably going to prefer to order online
20:15 - so we need to make sure we include
20:16 - online ordering on there do you offer
20:18 - any college specials we should probably
20:19 - have a tab on the website that talks
20:21 - about your specials for delivery to the
20:23 - to the kids at school by saying those
20:26 - kinds of things you really identify
20:28 - specifics about this business that might
20:31 - make it a little different from another
20:32 - pizza shop so in other words you have
20:34 - identified the customers problem so you
20:37 - can do all this in the initial meeting
20:38 - right use the initial meeting learn
20:41 - about the business that initial business
20:43 - help or that initial meeting and
20:45 - learning about the business helps you
20:47 - identify the business's problems you can
20:50 - then put together a proposal to solve
20:52 - those problems that proposal will be a
20:54 - website that includes all the types of
20:56 - features I just mentioned and then you
21:00 - close this sale by explaining to the
21:03 - person okay I'm going to build you a
21:06 - website here's what it's going to
21:10 - include and here's how it including
21:12 - those features will solve your problems
21:15 - are you interested in purchasing that
21:17 - versus okay I'll build your website
21:19 - here's how much it's gonna cost you
21:21 - wanted you know so right when you think
21:23 - about it the proposal that includes
21:25 - problem solving is going to sound a lot
21:29 - more effective now a lot of times this
21:31 - will all be during one conversation and
21:34 - the person will say good send me a
21:35 - contract
21:36 - have to have a couple of conversations
21:38 - with the person but the idea of using
21:41 - the initial meeting to identify problems
21:43 - putting together a proposal that solves
21:45 - those problems and then closing by
21:48 - explaining how the proposal solves those
21:49 - problems is how you connect with your
21:52 - potential customers and sell to your
21:54 - potential customers in a way that's much
21:56 - different than a lot of other developers
21:57 - and I think you'll see really good
21:59 - results with this we could easily do a
22:02 - 30 hour course just on selling alone but
22:05 - this is the initial framework that you
22:08 - need to focus on get information to
22:12 - identify problems but the other proposal
22:15 - solves those problems explain that
22:17 - problem-solving to the customer couple
22:21 - of things I want to say on these just to
22:24 - make a few fast points when you're
22:27 - getting ready for that initial meeting
22:29 - make sure you're in an appropriate venue
22:33 - for it like I said a lot of times those
22:36 - initial meetings are gonna be someone
22:38 - just calling you on your phone I've seen
22:40 - instances where a developer is driving
22:44 - down the road in their car and their
22:46 - business number rings and they answer it
22:48 - and they're trying to us they're
22:49 - essentially trying to do a sales call
22:51 - with a small business person while
22:53 - they're driving down the road I mean
22:56 - come on and think about that for a
22:58 - minute if you're driving down the road
23:00 - trying to talk to a customer you're not
23:02 - taking any notes you're supposed to be
23:05 - paying attention to the road so you're
23:07 - only halfway paying attention to the
23:09 - potential customer right you're not
23:12 - really in a position to have the kind of
23:14 - meaningful conversation you need to have
23:16 - to be able to identify that customers
23:18 - problems and discuss them intelligently
23:20 - so you're almost certainly going to lose
23:23 - that sale you'd be much better off in
23:26 - that instance to just let the call go to
23:28 - voicemail maybe the person will leave a
23:30 - voicemail maybe they won't but if they
23:32 - do leave a voicemail you can call them
23:33 - back when you're in a better environment
23:35 - to handle that phone call and in you
23:37 - have a good chance of closing that sale
23:39 - versus the developer who takes a call
23:40 - while they're driving down the road and
23:42 - almost certainly loses the sale that
23:46 - being said this kind of gets back to the
23:49 - first part of our video about being self
23:50 - motivated if it's during business hours
23:52 - you know make sure you're spending a lot
23:54 - of your day in places where you can take
23:57 - these kinds of phone calls don't be dick
23:59 - out driving around during business hours
24:01 - no more than you have to and so on so
24:03 - forth so setting yourself up to be able
24:06 - to take a phone call as silly as that
24:08 - sounds is something a lot of developers
24:10 - strike out at and by making yourself
24:13 - available and making sure you're in an
24:14 - appropriate setting to do these initial
24:16 - meetings usually over the phone you put
24:19 - yourself ahead when you're putting
24:21 - together that proposal in writing or
24:25 - first-first you're gonna put it together
24:27 - orally and explain it to the client and
24:29 - you'll put something together for them
24:31 - in writing when you put it together and
24:33 - explain here's what I propose it's very
24:35 - important that you explain it in a way
24:38 - the clients going to understand don't
24:41 - speak technical jargon to them more than
24:43 - you need to because the clients aren't
24:44 - going to understand most of that stuff
24:46 - when you're putting the proposal
24:47 - together into writing and a contract
24:49 - it's very important you spell out
24:51 - specifically what you are going to do
24:53 - for that customer otherwise you put
24:55 - yourself at risk of a disagreement over
24:57 - what you were going to do and not going
24:59 - to do so make sure the written proposal
25:00 - has your entire scope of work in it last
25:04 - thing is again when you're closing with
25:06 - that person start with okay here are the
25:10 - problems I've identified here's what I'm
25:12 - going to do here's how that will fix
25:14 - those problems again we can do a 30-hour
25:18 - course on selling go about things in
25:21 - this way and you will be a much better
25:23 - seller of your services than most of
25:25 - your competition initial meeting
25:28 - identifies problems proposal is where
25:31 - you put together the list of things
25:32 - you're going to do to solve those
25:34 - problems closing is when you explain to
25:36 - the customer how that proposal is going
25:39 - to solve the problems you've identified
25:41 - in the next part of our video we're
25:43 - going to talk about where to sell your
25:44 - services now that you've figured out how
25:46 - to do it
25:58 - okay so it just talked about where to
26:00 - sell your services as a freelance
26:01 - developer now it's important that we
26:03 - talk about where to sell those services
26:06 - because obviously you gotta have a way
26:09 - to connect with potential customers and
26:10 - put the selling skills we just talked
26:12 - about to use so let's look at some
26:16 - effective ways for you to go out and
26:18 - drum up business as a freelancer and
26:21 - really I'm going to talk about three
26:23 - sources the first is good old-fashioned
26:26 - networking second one is using
26:29 - third-party services and the third
26:31 - option is going to be utilizing your own
26:34 - website to go out and get business so
26:36 - let's look at each of these interns
26:39 - networking going to networking functions
26:42 - is just what it sounds like here is one
26:46 - thing I would suggest to that though to
26:49 - that point is I see a lot of developers
26:52 - who go out to networking functions as a
26:56 - way of trying to get business and most
26:58 - of the people as a networking event are
26:59 - other developers so in other words it's
27:01 - developers out talking to developers
27:04 - the idea being I am a developer I go to
27:08 - one of these functions I meet somebody
27:09 - else there's a job offer that they're
27:12 - not interested in or that they want to
27:14 - outsource and maybe they'll give it to
27:15 - me you can get some work doing this
27:18 - don't get me wrong there are ways to or
27:21 - you this is a way to get some business I
27:23 - should say that being said I don't think
27:25 - it's an effective way to go out and
27:27 - network what you want to do to drum up
27:32 - business this way that really stands out
27:34 - from other developers and it's just more
27:36 - effective is to go to networking events
27:38 - where the people there aren't other
27:40 - developers the people there are your
27:42 - potential customers or they know your
27:44 - potential customers so examples would be
27:47 - going to networking events where you're
27:49 - talking to very small business owners
27:51 - from a wide range of fields and so on so
27:54 - forth and you're the only developer in
27:55 - the room right I mean isn't that a lot
27:58 - better way to meet potential people that
28:01 - might want your services a really good
28:04 - place for doing this what I just
28:06 - mentioned is a group called BNI Business
28:08 - Network international there's going to
28:11 - be a link
28:11 - in the description below what BNI is is
28:16 - it's a national organization and most
28:19 - cities have multiple chapters you want
28:21 - to join a chapter that's as close to you
28:24 - as possible
28:25 - and what they do is they have exclusive
28:27 - spots for different fields so if you're
28:30 - the software developer in your chapter
28:32 - you're going to be the only software
28:33 - developer in that chapter there will
28:35 - also be four just as examples maybe a
28:38 - real-estate agent in that chapter a
28:40 - chiropractor a lawyer a general
28:44 - contractor a hair salon owner and so on
28:47 - and so forth and the idea of BNI is that
28:52 - everyone in that room is opening up
28:55 - their address book to you and you're
28:56 - opening up your address book to them so
28:58 - in other words if I'm the lawyer in the
29:01 - BNI chapter and during my journeys I
29:05 - Nene I come across a business owner who
29:08 - needs development work I will refer them
29:10 - to you as a developer and then if you
29:14 - doing during your journeys come across
29:17 - somebody that needs car maintenance you
29:20 - might refer them to the auto mechanic
29:22 - that's in the BNI group so in other
29:23 - words every once open their address
29:26 - books up to one another and because
29:29 - everyone in those groups are small
29:31 - business owners or is a good chance they
29:33 - know other small business owners BNI can
29:35 - be a really good place to network and
29:39 - meet small business owners who might
29:42 - need your services but also who might
29:44 - also refer you business from people they
29:46 - know so don't just go to networking
29:48 - events where you're just sitting around
29:49 - talking to other developers hoping to
29:51 - get some business out of it get out
29:52 - there and talk to the community at large
29:55 - and BNI is a great way to do that in the
29:59 - business community second option would
30:02 - be to use third party services by this I
30:05 - mean services such as Fiverr thumbtack
30:09 - these are essentially websites where
30:11 - you're probably familiar with them where
30:13 - you go on thumbtack for example you fill
30:17 - out a profile you profile you say you're
30:20 - a developer and then somebody who needs
30:22 - development services might go on to felt
30:24 - like a website
30:25 - might go on to thumbtack and put out an
30:28 - offer saying I want a developer to do
30:31 - this and then you can bid on that work
30:33 - fibers works a little differently but
30:35 - it's generally the same concepts in
30:37 - other words it's a third party website
30:38 - that matches the providers of services
30:41 - with consumers of services the upside of
30:45 - doing a third party platform like fiber
30:48 - or thumbtack is that those platforms get
30:52 - a lot of traffic I mean a lot there are
30:54 - a lot of people who anytime they need
30:56 - something they go to Fiverr they go to
30:59 - thumbtack so for example if I'm the
31:02 - small local pizza shop owner and every
31:05 - time I need some repairs done inside my
31:07 - restaurant I call a contractor off the
31:09 - thumbtack or anytime I need something
31:12 - else done I call somebody off the
31:14 - thumbtack they're probably going to do
31:15 - the exact same thing when they want a
31:17 - website built so UNTAC by ever those
31:20 - kinds of sites are a very good way to
31:22 - put you into connection with a lot of
31:24 - potential customers the downside of
31:27 - these kinds of services are that a you
31:32 - tend to be doing the work at a rate
31:35 - lower than what you would prefer to
31:36 - charge it's just the nature of fiber and
31:39 - thumbtack in these third party platforms
31:41 - is that you tend to do the work in a bit
31:42 - of a discount so a website you might
31:45 - normally charge $3,000 for you might
31:47 - charge two thousand dollars or even
31:49 - $1500 or even $1,000 for it if you're
31:52 - doing it on one of these websites and
31:54 - you have to pay to get the lead on top
31:57 - of it so you're looking at much tighter
31:59 - profit margins that being said there's
32:01 - an abundance of work to go out there and
32:04 - get so ups and downs to that third
32:08 - option would be to build up your own
32:11 - website and promote it when you build up
32:14 - your website you want to do it in a way
32:16 - that I talked about in the second part
32:17 - of our video and build your website in a
32:20 - way that tells potential customers I am
32:23 - going to listen to your problems and
32:24 - help you solve them when you're
32:26 - promoting your website for most people
32:29 - the most effective way to do that is
32:31 - going to be to utilize a pay-per-click
32:33 - program like Google Adwords you know
32:37 - we're all familiar about those
32:38 - those paid paid ads you see at the top
32:40 - of Google and Bing outside of doing this
32:44 - is it's your website so you're not
32:48 - discounting your work you know the
32:49 - website that you might build for a
32:50 - thousand dollars for someone finding you
32:52 - on Fiverr thumbtack you'll charge the
32:54 - full three thousand dollars let's say if
32:55 - they're calling you directly on your
32:58 - website that's one up size your is the
33:02 - billing rate another upside is you know
33:06 - you're not paying for those leads in the
33:08 - sense that you are Fiverr contact but
33:10 - you are paying for the ads so and Google
33:13 - AdWords can get quite expensive if you
33:17 - go the route of your own website and
33:21 - decide to promote it through a program
33:23 - like Google Adwords
33:25 - one thing I would strongly suggest is
33:28 - avoid the various pay-per-click
33:30 - management services that are out there
33:32 - there are a lot of services out there
33:34 - that say we'll manage your pay-per-click
33:35 - for you and then they take a percentage
33:37 - of your advertising budget for doing so
33:41 - if you're paying for Adwords you can
33:44 - actually call Google AdWords support and
33:46 - they'll help you with any aspects of it
33:48 - you want and there's plenty of tutorials
33:51 - even on YouTube on how to use AdWords
33:53 - effectively do not pay somebody to
33:55 - manage that for you that just really
33:57 - raises your advertising costs
33:59 - exponentially so really the three
34:02 - biggest ways just to sum up to get
34:04 - business as a freelance developer go to
34:06 - networking events third party platforms
34:08 - and using your own website you're going
34:11 - to do the networking route again don't
34:14 - talk to other don't talk to other
34:15 - developers talk to various business
34:18 - owners and other individuals BNI is a
34:19 - great way to do that again the link is
34:21 - below third party platforms fiber
34:24 - thumbtack upside of this lots of
34:26 - potential business downside much smaller
34:28 - profit margins your own website upside
34:31 - of this is you're charging full price
34:34 - for your work downside of this is you
34:36 - are paying for advertising really just
34:39 - pick any of these that you feel works
34:41 - best for your situation and try a
34:43 - combination you know like of all of them
34:45 - so again when you connect with clients
34:49 - through any of these platforms
34:52 - make sure you employ the selling
34:54 - techniques we talked about in the last
34:57 - part of our video well this pretty much
35:00 - sums it up in terms of a quick
35:02 - discussion on how to make money as a
35:05 - freelancer if you have any questions
35:06 - just contact us directly

Cleaned transcript:

hi my name is Luke Siciliano and I'm a web developer this is going to be a fourpart discussion on how you can make money as a freelancer this is a really important topic to talk about because a lot of people who are just finishing free code camp are wondering what am I going to do now I finish the certificate program am I going to go out in three lanced am I going to get a job if I'm going to start a business it's understandable that people have been so focused on their education that now they might be a little nervous about wondering what they're gonna do with that education so in this discussion we're going to look at the option of being a freelance developer okay now we're going to look at four things number one is should you be a freelancer at all because obviously if freelance work isn't a good fit for you personally then you don't need to know anything else about it number two we're going to look at how to make yourself stand out from other freelance developers number three is going to be how to sell your services because selling is something a lot of people just aren't comfortable with and number four after we've talked about how to sell your services we'll talk about where to take those salesmanship skills and to sell your services and who you're gonna how who you're going to reach out to how you're going to reach out to them so on and so forth and I think after getting over going over those four things you'll have a basic understanding of do I want to be a freelancer and if so this is a good here's how I'm gonna go down that path and earn a living doing it well let's start with the most important question and that is should you be a freelance developer at all because obviously if you don't have the personality type for it then you don't need any of the other information right when asking the question should I be a freelance developer you really got to break that question down into two parts number one is a good fit for your personality and number two can you make money doing it because if it's not a good fit for you then you're probably destined to fail at it and if it is a good fit for you then you're probably a good chance of succeeding at it the second part of that can you make money doing it is really important right because if you can't make a living doing this why would you do it so let's start with the question of should you and look at your personality type and say are you good fit for freelance work when you're saying am i a good fit for freelance work you really need to ask yourself are you a social selfmotivated individual or you someone who needs structure provided to you here's what I mean by that when you're doing freelance work you're going to really be your own self regulating boss you're gonna be the one to make sure that you start work at a certain time every day that you work through a certain time every day a lot of times you're gonna be working from home so you need to be able to filter out distractions you need to be able to impose deadlines upon yourself and have a certain sense of discipline so if you're very selfmotivated and self disciplined then freelance work might be a good fit for you because no one's gonna be imposing that structure on you all right now if you're someone who needs a certain structure in your life in other words you need a boss telling you you have to beat your desk by 830 every morning you need to be told when assignments are due by because if you're not told when they're due by you might just put them off put them off put them off if you're easily distracted you're someone who is probably I need that structure provided for you by an employer a lot of times when you're a freelancer for example you're going to be working at home and you know you're working at home the doorbell rings you answer it sign for your package from Amazon and now you're distracted you can't get yourself back to work if that's your personality type then you need structure provided for you in other words you need a boss you need that company that's going to tell you here's when things are due here's when to be here so on so forth and if that's your personality type you're probably better off being an employee versus the person who's selfmotivated and self disciplined who is probably better off being a freelance developer and being their own boss now if you're someone who needs that structure provided for you there's nothing wrong with that there are a lot of really successful people in the world who aren't self employed aren't freelancers and they just need to work within a structure but when they're in that environment they really excel at it so if this isn't for you and you're saying well I need structure don't feel bad about that it just means that freelance work is right for you it means you should probably be working for somebody instead that being said if you're that selfmotivated individual you would probably be frustrated working in a really structured job because you know you don't need someone telling you when to get things done and so on so for if you can work independently and people that can work independently tend to Excel a little bit more in environments where they're their own boss so really ask yourself are you a selfmotivated self disciplined individual or do you need structure provided for you if it's the former freelance work is probably a good fit for you now the next question is assuming I have the personality type to be a freelance developer can I make money doing this because again need to make a living right gotta pay the bills I would answer yes you can make money as a freelance developer and I would actually argue that for freelancers there's a market out there of twenty one point six billion dollars you can tap into it's a lot of numbers I'm gonna say again twenty one point six billion I would have written out all the zeros but I'm quite lazy and I don't like to write that much how do I come up with this number that there's a twenty one almost twenty two billion dollar market for you to tap into I'll break this down there's roughly twenty four million small businesses in the United States I that I'm talking about the local bakery local pizza shop local bar local hair salon local fitness studio you name it just start naming businesses all right roughly twenty four million of them roughly thirty percent twenty nine percent but will rounded up to thirty roughly thirty percent of those small businesses in 2017 either don't have a website or have one that is drastically outofdate it might not be mobilefriendly something of that nature may sound inconceivable to us as tech people that how can thirty percent of small businesses not have a website it's true so if thirty percent of small businesses need web work done and there's 24 million small businesses that's 7.2 million small businesses in the country that need that kind of work now let's say you would charge the average small business $3,000 for any website that's probably a really low number but for the purpose of this discussion let's go with it if you charge $3,000 for the average website and there's 7.2 million small businesses that need that service 7.2 million times $3,000 is 21 billion 600 million so that's how I come up with the number that there's a market out there of 21 billion 600 million dollars out there for you to cap in tap into last time I checked that's a lot of money okay and if you do some of the things we're going to talk about a little later in this video I think you can tap into this effectively so that being said there's a big market you can make a lot of money this number probably actually underestimates the opportunity out there and the reason I say that is that's assuming you're just building a relatively cheap website for those small businesses what if you're building a website for the local pizza pizza shop and they want a mobile app or something on top of it you might charge them more than the $3,000 so big market you can make a lot of money doing this so on the question of should you be a freelancer ask yourself are you selfmotivated or do you need structure provided for you if you're a selfmotivated individual this is for you if you need the structure that job provides not for you can you make money doing this make a lot of money doing this so ask yourself those questions look at it in those terms and say is this for me if it is keep on watching in the next part of the video we're going to talk about how to make yourself stand out from other freelance developers okay we're back for part two in our discussion of how to make money as a freelance developer and since you're still watching that means you've decided that freelancing is potentially for you and you want to know how to go about building a business as a freelancer so in this part of the video we're going to talk about how to make your services stand out a little bit against those of other freelancers so you can make a good living and not just be part of the pack and then we'll go on to how to sell your services properly and you'll see that this part of the video will wrap into the next part in a little bit but this has some important discussions that we need to have before we talk about how to actually sell your services and since you've already watched the first part of the video you have figured out my handwriting is terrible good a lot of things writing is not one of them sorry so let's talk about how to make yourself stand out from other developers though now this is an important topic to have a discussion on the reason for that is I feel there's a very big disconnect between the development community and the people who would consume the services of the developers mainly small businesses here's why I say there's a disconnect as I said in as I said in the last part of my video there's roughly thirty percent of small businesses don't have a quality website in 2017 so this is those businesses right here if you go onto google and just do a search in your local city for you know name of my city website builder you will find an abundance of people ready to build websites for these businesses just in your town okay so if you've got this huge pool of potential customers and you've got this abundance of labor ready to do the work that these people need you have to ask why isn't this work getting done right because again lots of work lots of people to do it but somehow these services aren't getting sold in other words there is a disconnect these developers are not connecting with these potential customers in a way that makes these potential customers say I want to buy that service so if you really want to make yourself stand out as freelancer you've got to bridge this gap otherwise you're just gonna be one of these developers stuck over here wondering why can't I get this business why can't I get this business so let's really fast look at how you're gonna bridge this and the biggest step to bridging that and I'll explain what I mean by this but it's to understand that once you become a freelancer you're not a developer you're not a coder you're not a programmer you're not an app builder you're not oh whatever you want to call itself you are a problem solver okay you're a problem solver and here's what I mean by that let's say I'm the potential small business customer I'm a local pizza shop I don't have a website I want a website so that potential customers can order food online I want a website so that someone who's never been to my pizza shop before can look at photos of my dining room see how nice it is see how nice my bar is when they see those pictures maybe they'll come into my restaurant right that's all I care about I care about getting those needs met and that's it but here when I'm sitting here with those needs the average developer sitting over here going I'll build your website using the latest CMS I will build your website writing my own HTML I know CSS I know PHP I'm really good with JavaScript so on so forth this person this small business owner doesn't even know what any of that stuff means first of all and when someone's going I use a CMS or I will write it in HTML instead using a CMS this person over here is gonna say well okay but explain to me how that solves my problem all right so really these developers are talking a they're talking past the potential customers and they're talking over the heads of the potential customers okay so what you need to do is identify the problems of that small business let's stick with the pizza shop example that's where the developer should say tell me a little bit about your needs I would like a website okay and then the developer can ask questions understand what it is that the customer is trying to get from that website and then the developer can propose solutions to meet those problems so in other words it's important for the developer to be an active listener and then propose a solution based on that active listening this is a really big contrast to the experience you'll have if you go onto Google and as I said look for developers in your local area because again you'll see the local developer who's got his own website talks about his coding skills again if you're the small business owner all that talk about coding skills doesn't talk about meeting your problems in meeting your needs when they smile businessperson talks that developer on the phone that developer a lot of times it's just going to talk about code and technical jargon that a small business owners understand again everything I'm a small business owner right here everything I've just heard from that guy isn't speaking to my needs so I'm probably gonna call somebody else so what you really need to do is understand you're not a coder you're a problem solver you need to make an important part of your job identifying the problems of the customer and then proposing a solution to meet those problems if you do that you bridge this disconnect and while all these developers are stuck over here wondering how they get business you're crossing this bridge and you're tapping into these roughly 7.2 million small businesses that don't have a website or need a website in 2017 and that's how you're gonna make a lot of money now this concept is going to get wrapped a little bit into the next part of our discussion on how to best sell your services it's very very important that you recognize that there's this disconnect out there between the development community and the people that need those services and that you can bridge that disconnect by making yourself a problem solver understand these things and you'll really make yourself stand out so all that being said let's apply some of this to how to sell your services okay we're back for part three in our video discussion on how to make money as a freelance developer we just looked at how to make yourself stand out a little bit from the crowd and how to really make yourself a good business person as opposed to a lot of the freelancers that are just kind of skating by and that is by understanding and solving your customers problems as opposed to wanting to just say I'm a developer I write code alright making yourself a problem solvers how you make yourself stand out in this part of the video we're going to talk about how to sell your services which is something a lot of people aren't comfortable with and you're going to see what we just talked about about being a problem solver really rolls into selling your services effectively before we talk about how to sell your services there's one thing I want to get out of the way and that is that I understand a lot of people aren't comfortable selling a lot of people aren't comfortable talking about themselves talking up their services dealing with other people in a sales kind of way well two things to that number one is some people this comes naturally to some people it doesn't but everybody can be good at it sales are something that if you're willing to get outside of your comfort zone a little bit and work on it and practice and give it an effort you can get good at it even if you're not necessarily the most comfortable with it right now so the selling your services is something you can do I can't stress that enough you can sell your services even if you feel uncomfortable with it the second thing I want to mention real fast is that you don't have a choice if you want to be a freelance developer if you're not good at selling your services or I should say if you don't make an effort at being good at selling your services you're going to go broke because you're not going to have any customers ok so again you can do this you can sell trust me I've seen lots of people who initially were uncomfortable selling that over time and do me anytime got good at it so all that being said let's talk about how to go about selling your services which is something a lot of people are really unsure of how to do and this really comes down to a couple of things really the initial meeting with a potential customer will talk about that we'll talk about putting together a proposal for that potential customer and we'll talk about closing that deal and a lot of times this will all essentially be within one conversation so you know might span a couple but typically you're looking at one so the first thing is the initial meeting this might be a meeting it wherever you're working if you have an office a lot of times you gonna be working on this will probably be over the telephone potential customers going to call you this is your chance to make yourself a problem solver like we just talked about we're gonna stick with the local pizza shop on our example example and you've got to use this initial contact with a potential client to identify the potential clients problem so you can help the client understand how you're going to solve those problems so let's say again I'm a local pizza shop owner I call you your web developer typical web developer in my experience the typical web developer might say something along the lines of okay what kind of business is it okay it's a pizza shop do you need online ordering okay do you need online reservations okay anything else about your business all right well let me give you a quote well that doesn't really do a lot to understand the customers business if you take the steps to understand the customers business you can identify the problems and by identifying the problems you do a lot better so let's look at how this should go okay the developers talking to the pizza shop owner okay you're a pizza shop owner are you dying in only or you carryout only or do you have a dine in business okay you have a significant dining business so where is your customer base is it just a local neighborhood around you oh you're right by a university as well so you sell with a lot of college sell them a lot of college kids and not just you know like residential areas okay would your customers prefer to order online is that something you've experimented with do you have a bar in your establishment or is it just a pizza shop itself what are your goals what are your goals as a you know business do you want to grow to multiple locations so on and so forth by asking those kinds of questions you really start to understand what it is this business wants to accomplish right oh you're a business you have a significant business with a significant dying in business as well as a takeout business we're going to need a photo gallery that showcases showcases your dining in experience we might wanna get some professional photographs taken that shown people eating having a good time feature the waitstaff so on so forth oh you've got a bar you know we should make sure we feature the bar as well you are right by a college well you know a lot of younger people are probably going to prefer to order online so we need to make sure we include online ordering on there do you offer any college specials we should probably have a tab on the website that talks about your specials for delivery to the to the kids at school by saying those kinds of things you really identify specifics about this business that might make it a little different from another pizza shop so in other words you have identified the customers problem so you can do all this in the initial meeting right use the initial meeting learn about the business that initial business help or that initial meeting and learning about the business helps you identify the business's problems you can then put together a proposal to solve those problems that proposal will be a website that includes all the types of features I just mentioned and then you close this sale by explaining to the person okay I'm going to build you a website here's what it's going to include and here's how it including those features will solve your problems are you interested in purchasing that versus okay I'll build your website here's how much it's gonna cost you wanted you know so right when you think about it the proposal that includes problem solving is going to sound a lot more effective now a lot of times this will all be during one conversation and the person will say good send me a contract have to have a couple of conversations with the person but the idea of using the initial meeting to identify problems putting together a proposal that solves those problems and then closing by explaining how the proposal solves those problems is how you connect with your potential customers and sell to your potential customers in a way that's much different than a lot of other developers and I think you'll see really good results with this we could easily do a 30 hour course just on selling alone but this is the initial framework that you need to focus on get information to identify problems but the other proposal solves those problems explain that problemsolving to the customer couple of things I want to say on these just to make a few fast points when you're getting ready for that initial meeting make sure you're in an appropriate venue for it like I said a lot of times those initial meetings are gonna be someone just calling you on your phone I've seen instances where a developer is driving down the road in their car and their business number rings and they answer it and they're trying to us they're essentially trying to do a sales call with a small business person while they're driving down the road I mean come on and think about that for a minute if you're driving down the road trying to talk to a customer you're not taking any notes you're supposed to be paying attention to the road so you're only halfway paying attention to the potential customer right you're not really in a position to have the kind of meaningful conversation you need to have to be able to identify that customers problems and discuss them intelligently so you're almost certainly going to lose that sale you'd be much better off in that instance to just let the call go to voicemail maybe the person will leave a voicemail maybe they won't but if they do leave a voicemail you can call them back when you're in a better environment to handle that phone call and in you have a good chance of closing that sale versus the developer who takes a call while they're driving down the road and almost certainly loses the sale that being said this kind of gets back to the first part of our video about being self motivated if it's during business hours you know make sure you're spending a lot of your day in places where you can take these kinds of phone calls don't be dick out driving around during business hours no more than you have to and so on so forth so setting yourself up to be able to take a phone call as silly as that sounds is something a lot of developers strike out at and by making yourself available and making sure you're in an appropriate setting to do these initial meetings usually over the phone you put yourself ahead when you're putting together that proposal in writing or firstfirst you're gonna put it together orally and explain it to the client and you'll put something together for them in writing when you put it together and explain here's what I propose it's very important that you explain it in a way the clients going to understand don't speak technical jargon to them more than you need to because the clients aren't going to understand most of that stuff when you're putting the proposal together into writing and a contract it's very important you spell out specifically what you are going to do for that customer otherwise you put yourself at risk of a disagreement over what you were going to do and not going to do so make sure the written proposal has your entire scope of work in it last thing is again when you're closing with that person start with okay here are the problems I've identified here's what I'm going to do here's how that will fix those problems again we can do a 30hour course on selling go about things in this way and you will be a much better seller of your services than most of your competition initial meeting identifies problems proposal is where you put together the list of things you're going to do to solve those problems closing is when you explain to the customer how that proposal is going to solve the problems you've identified in the next part of our video we're going to talk about where to sell your services now that you've figured out how to do it okay so it just talked about where to sell your services as a freelance developer now it's important that we talk about where to sell those services because obviously you gotta have a way to connect with potential customers and put the selling skills we just talked about to use so let's look at some effective ways for you to go out and drum up business as a freelancer and really I'm going to talk about three sources the first is good oldfashioned networking second one is using thirdparty services and the third option is going to be utilizing your own website to go out and get business so let's look at each of these interns networking going to networking functions is just what it sounds like here is one thing I would suggest to that though to that point is I see a lot of developers who go out to networking functions as a way of trying to get business and most of the people as a networking event are other developers so in other words it's developers out talking to developers the idea being I am a developer I go to one of these functions I meet somebody else there's a job offer that they're not interested in or that they want to outsource and maybe they'll give it to me you can get some work doing this don't get me wrong there are ways to or you this is a way to get some business I should say that being said I don't think it's an effective way to go out and network what you want to do to drum up business this way that really stands out from other developers and it's just more effective is to go to networking events where the people there aren't other developers the people there are your potential customers or they know your potential customers so examples would be going to networking events where you're talking to very small business owners from a wide range of fields and so on so forth and you're the only developer in the room right I mean isn't that a lot better way to meet potential people that might want your services a really good place for doing this what I just mentioned is a group called BNI Business Network international there's going to be a link in the description below what BNI is is it's a national organization and most cities have multiple chapters you want to join a chapter that's as close to you as possible and what they do is they have exclusive spots for different fields so if you're the software developer in your chapter you're going to be the only software developer in that chapter there will also be four just as examples maybe a realestate agent in that chapter a chiropractor a lawyer a general contractor a hair salon owner and so on and so forth and the idea of BNI is that everyone in that room is opening up their address book to you and you're opening up your address book to them so in other words if I'm the lawyer in the BNI chapter and during my journeys I Nene I come across a business owner who needs development work I will refer them to you as a developer and then if you doing during your journeys come across somebody that needs car maintenance you might refer them to the auto mechanic that's in the BNI group so in other words every once open their address books up to one another and because everyone in those groups are small business owners or is a good chance they know other small business owners BNI can be a really good place to network and meet small business owners who might need your services but also who might also refer you business from people they know so don't just go to networking events where you're just sitting around talking to other developers hoping to get some business out of it get out there and talk to the community at large and BNI is a great way to do that in the business community second option would be to use third party services by this I mean services such as Fiverr thumbtack these are essentially websites where you're probably familiar with them where you go on thumbtack for example you fill out a profile you profile you say you're a developer and then somebody who needs development services might go on to felt like a website might go on to thumbtack and put out an offer saying I want a developer to do this and then you can bid on that work fibers works a little differently but it's generally the same concepts in other words it's a third party website that matches the providers of services with consumers of services the upside of doing a third party platform like fiber or thumbtack is that those platforms get a lot of traffic I mean a lot there are a lot of people who anytime they need something they go to Fiverr they go to thumbtack so for example if I'm the small local pizza shop owner and every time I need some repairs done inside my restaurant I call a contractor off the thumbtack or anytime I need something else done I call somebody off the thumbtack they're probably going to do the exact same thing when they want a website built so UNTAC by ever those kinds of sites are a very good way to put you into connection with a lot of potential customers the downside of these kinds of services are that a you tend to be doing the work at a rate lower than what you would prefer to charge it's just the nature of fiber and thumbtack in these third party platforms is that you tend to do the work in a bit of a discount so a website you might normally charge $3,000 for you might charge two thousand dollars or even $1500 or even $1,000 for it if you're doing it on one of these websites and you have to pay to get the lead on top of it so you're looking at much tighter profit margins that being said there's an abundance of work to go out there and get so ups and downs to that third option would be to build up your own website and promote it when you build up your website you want to do it in a way that I talked about in the second part of our video and build your website in a way that tells potential customers I am going to listen to your problems and help you solve them when you're promoting your website for most people the most effective way to do that is going to be to utilize a payperclick program like Google Adwords you know we're all familiar about those those paid paid ads you see at the top of Google and Bing outside of doing this is it's your website so you're not discounting your work you know the website that you might build for a thousand dollars for someone finding you on Fiverr thumbtack you'll charge the full three thousand dollars let's say if they're calling you directly on your website that's one up size your is the billing rate another upside is you know you're not paying for those leads in the sense that you are Fiverr contact but you are paying for the ads so and Google AdWords can get quite expensive if you go the route of your own website and decide to promote it through a program like Google Adwords one thing I would strongly suggest is avoid the various payperclick management services that are out there there are a lot of services out there that say we'll manage your payperclick for you and then they take a percentage of your advertising budget for doing so if you're paying for Adwords you can actually call Google AdWords support and they'll help you with any aspects of it you want and there's plenty of tutorials even on YouTube on how to use AdWords effectively do not pay somebody to manage that for you that just really raises your advertising costs exponentially so really the three biggest ways just to sum up to get business as a freelance developer go to networking events third party platforms and using your own website you're going to do the networking route again don't talk to other don't talk to other developers talk to various business owners and other individuals BNI is a great way to do that again the link is below third party platforms fiber thumbtack upside of this lots of potential business downside much smaller profit margins your own website upside of this is you're charging full price for your work downside of this is you are paying for advertising really just pick any of these that you feel works best for your situation and try a combination you know like of all of them so again when you connect with clients through any of these platforms make sure you employ the selling techniques we talked about in the last part of our video well this pretty much sums it up in terms of a quick discussion on how to make money as a freelancer if you have any questions just contact us directly
