00:04 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with jesse i'm jesse and today i'm going
00:08 - to try to fix the problem that we
00:11 - encountered yesterday
00:14 - and there were a few reasons why that
00:16 - was happening
00:18 - and so i'm going to share with you a
00:19 - couple of the reasons
00:21 - and
00:22 - then we're going to try to fix it if you
00:24 - didn't see yesterday's video here's a
00:26 - quick recap of what we tried to do
00:30 - we started up a
00:33 - sql a mysql database on google's cloud
00:36 - platform
00:38 - and
00:39 - we
00:40 - took our wordpress mysql database that
00:43 - we've been using for this project
00:45 - and we made a copy
00:48 - and then we sent that copy over to the
00:51 - new database that we're running on
00:52 - google's cloud platform
00:54 - so
00:55 - the database is there the tables are
00:57 - there we verified that
01:01 - but we couldn't connect
01:05 - we were attempting to host wordpress
01:08 - with
01:09 - now
01:10 - from zeit and we couldn't get it to
01:13 - connect to the database and that's kind
01:15 - of where we left off
01:17 - yesterday
01:18 - so i thought a lot about it
01:21 - i couldn't even though i stopped working
01:23 - i did not stop thinking about that
01:25 - problem which i don't know if that
01:26 - happens to you all but that frequently
01:28 - happens to me like if there's a problem
01:31 - i didn't solve i
01:32 - i just keep thinking about it all the
01:35 - time i think maybe it'd be better if i
01:37 - just worked until i fixed it and then i
01:39 - could be at peace but
01:42 - in this case
01:45 - i think i've found the solution but i
01:48 - haven't had time to test it yet
01:50 - the solution is
01:52 - from what i understand
01:55 - in addition to a few other adjustments
01:58 - we're going to
01:59 - make a proxy
02:02 - because
02:04 - we authorize some ip addresses some
02:06 - networks unfortunately when you host the
02:09 - site with now you don't have an ip
02:12 - address it changes too often so they
02:13 - don't even give you the ip address
02:16 - uh of your your instance of whatever
02:20 - you're running with now so in cases
02:23 - where you can't give them an ip address
02:26 - google's cloud sql offers the option of
02:29 - running a proxy and accessing it like
02:32 - that
02:33 - there's also a further complication
02:38 - that harshit found and that was
02:44 - we were
02:46 - the example we were using to run
02:48 - wordpress with now was assuming
02:50 - that we were using aws
02:53 - and their security
02:55 - so
02:56 - we we may need to go in and disable some
02:58 - of that stuff too
03:01 - but first i definitely want to
03:05 - get this proxy set up so i haven't done
03:07 - this before
03:09 - we're going to go through it together i
03:11 - have the instructions up here somewhere
03:12 - i'm going to paste in a link to the
03:14 - instructions so you all can check that
03:15 - out with me
03:19 - and
03:21 - let's see
03:23 - hey hey everybody uh
03:26 - see there's a few you saying hi
03:29 - yeah let's
03:33 - let's get started
03:36 - so as soon as i find those instructions
03:40 - i'm gonna send them all to you and we're
03:42 - gonna get started so here they are
03:46 - there in the chat now
03:48 - if you have trouble clicking on that to
03:50 - and it doesn't open then try copying and
03:53 - pasting it
03:56 - and
04:01 - let's see
04:03 - all right i'm gonna make sure i have
04:04 - this up on one of my other screens
04:08 - and we can get started with that
04:20 - my computer if my fan is running too
04:22 - loud and that's bothering you let me
04:24 - know i tried closing down as much as i
04:27 - could and i can't figure out what is
04:29 - running
04:30 - uh and causing the fan to uh to
04:34 - run in overdrive like that
04:37 - all right so let me let's move over to
04:39 - the split screen
04:42 - there we are
04:46 - okay harshit is making a pull request
04:50 - right now to fix some of those issues so
04:54 - i'm gonna wait and pull down the latest
04:56 - changes before we do anything on this uh
04:59 - repo that you see here
05:01 - uh and what i'm gonna do instead is go
05:04 - through
05:06 - let's start this timer and let me pull
05:08 - this over here
05:10 - and let's go through some of these
05:13 - instructions
05:17 - try to get this working
05:20 - all right
05:24 - we can see here the proxy what it's
05:26 - going to do for us is
05:29 - it's going to let us access
05:31 - our server
05:33 - our database here without white listing
05:36 - ip addresses so that's what we we can't
05:39 - white list because we don't have you
05:41 - know a static ip address or even really
05:43 - a range that we could set
05:46 - so
05:51 - i guess we could y'all can read this if
05:53 - you want more info but uh the graphics
05:56 - are nice
05:57 - uh so
06:02 - this is how it's going to connect
06:06 - uh instead of going directly
06:09 - to
06:10 - uh cloud sql
06:12 - obviously the proxy lets us
06:16 - go to the proxy and then go to cloud sql
06:18 - so uh pretty simple concept uh i at
06:23 - least i think let me know if it's if
06:24 - it's not i have been reading up on this
06:27 - for a while so if you
06:29 - i may have a slight advantage at
06:30 - understanding it
06:34 - okay
06:38 - all right so we've enabled the api so we
06:41 - did that yesterday
06:44 - we need these gcp authentication
06:47 - credentials
06:49 - so i'm just going to open that another
06:50 - window for right now
06:52 - valid database user account password we
06:55 - set that up yesterday
06:58 - your instance must have an external ip
07:01 - address which we we have
07:07 - alright awesome so
07:12 - let's um
07:16 - let's try this out and try this out on
07:18 - our
07:19 - i'm using a mac right now
07:21 - so
07:22 - let's get to our command line and let me
07:25 - organize this a bit better
07:27 - all right so let's go over to our
07:28 - command line
07:31 - and
07:36 - yeah i'll just open up a new window here
07:40 - all right so we're going to download
07:41 - this great downloaded so quickly and
07:45 - then
07:46 - we're gonna make it executable
07:49 - great
08:02 - we need to provide it with
08:04 - this info so we should have all this
08:06 - info
08:08 - stay to come if you're application we
08:10 - sent the clouds
08:13 - go find credentials
08:15 - here's what's on the cage
08:17 - okay great so impressed
08:33 - okay i'm just scanning over this
08:36 - i think it's always good practice to
08:38 - read all the instructions before doing
08:40 - it
08:40 - um
08:43 - i don't know when i'm cooking it always
08:44 - helps with the recipe if i know what's
08:46 - going to happen ahead of time so i'm not
08:47 - going to read it all i'm just going to
08:49 - scan a bit
09:10 - hmm
09:32 - all right this is good we're gonna they
09:35 - have a github page just for this that
09:37 - we're using which is awesome
09:59 - all right so we are just testing this
10:01 - right now but eventually we would have
10:03 - to go to this step if we end up using
10:05 - this so
10:08 - let's go
10:10 - now i can't find where i left off
10:18 - all right we'll see how do we want to
10:20 - provide these
10:21 - credentials
10:24 - all right
10:40 - you can create a credential file
10:55 - hmm
11:16 - okay
11:22 - all right so we have a few more people
11:24 - joining us for those of you that are
11:25 - joining i just want to reiterate we're
11:27 - going through this process i've never
11:29 - done this before so that's why there's a
11:31 - bit of silence on my part from kind of
11:33 - reading over this
11:36 - i am going to check the chat because it
11:37 - looks like there's a lot in here
11:48 - um
12:02 - okay
12:03 - so it it does look like uh harshit made
12:06 - a pull request there so when the time
12:08 - comes we're gonna to put bringing his
12:09 - pool requests
12:13 - before we attempt to
12:16 - connect everything
12:18 - the wordpress
12:20 - instance to this database
12:23 - um
12:25 - let's see
12:26 - okay i'll go through if you have asked
12:28 - some questions i will uh answer those
12:30 - questions as soon as our pomodoro timer
12:32 - is up so we have about 17 minutes left
12:34 - here
12:35 - uh at this point
12:39 - let me let me paste this in the chat as
12:41 - well and then that way you can check out
12:42 - the tool that we were using that we just
12:46 - loaded that i just loaded locally
12:50 - and
12:53 - i guess
12:54 - for those of you that weren't here
12:55 - earlier here's the page for the
12:57 - instructions we're following
13:00 - okay
13:02 - so here's some example invocations
13:08 - so let's check this out
13:32 - hmm
13:41 - i guess we can try one of these
13:52 - all right so let me try
13:57 - let's move over to here
14:02 - just to
14:03 - change this up so we we do need to
14:05 - replace
14:17 - you need
14:32 - so i'm trying to figure out where
14:33 - they're expecting this to be run from
15:23 - hmm
15:36 - all right
15:37 - let's see
15:41 - all right so i'm not exactly sure let me
15:43 - tell you what i'm i'm thinking right now
15:44 - what i'm not sure about i may just end
15:46 - up copying some stuff and throwing it in
15:47 - the command line just to see if it works
15:50 - uh because
15:52 - we read up here
15:55 - a little earlier
15:59 - i guess up here
16:03 - first it was talking about loading this
16:05 - proxy on your local machine
16:07 - and then it was saying
16:10 - uh something about
16:14 - running it in the google cloud platform
16:17 - console
16:20 - which which i mean that's definitely two
16:22 - different things so i'm trying to
16:27 - to figure out
16:29 - what they want
16:49 - um
16:54 - let's go
17:07 - all right so we have that cloud sql
17:09 - proxy
17:13 - all right good it's not a directory
17:15 - let's see if we can
17:16 - just whenever i just do run
17:21 - run is not a command what's the
17:22 - equivalent command
17:45 - actually maybe i'll just look here
18:00 - okay
18:02 - of course
18:10 - all right so we definitely need default
18:11 - credentials
18:18 - which is what we're trying to do over
18:19 - here
18:30 - i just need to figure out what the
18:33 - credentials are
18:35 - and actually this this will help
18:51 - okay
18:53 - we have this info
18:56 - i'm just gonna grab it from
19:23 - okay
19:26 - and
19:37 - i wonder
19:38 - if
19:40 - this is going to be the database name
19:46 - let's see if this is what they want
19:52 - all right i'm not sure if they want like
19:54 - the main name for the google cloud
19:55 - account or the database username we'll
19:58 - find out
20:00 - all right so let's try this out now
20:04 - what's
20:05 - wordpress command i found all right so
20:07 - obviously that was not what they needed
20:15 - so let's try it again
20:33 - uh shoot it's treating it like two
20:35 - different commands
20:44 - let's see
21:15 - hmm
21:31 - all right
21:42 - just i'm checking back in the chat to
21:44 - see if
21:45 - see if i've lost all of you
21:47 - uh
21:48 - since i'm a bit lost myself all right so
21:52 - i mean at this point
21:57 - i'm just gonna try a few more variations
22:00 - on this
22:02 - uh on this command and see if i can get
22:07 - uh something different to come up
22:09 - uh even if it's a different error
22:11 - message that's going to be progress
22:13 - uh if it doesn't work after a few more
22:15 - tries then i'll just go back to the
22:16 - documentation make sure i didn't miss a
22:18 - step
22:24 - all right
23:00 - you know what
23:02 - let's let me double check
23:06 - this i think
23:11 - there was something
23:33 - yeah maybe since we're doing this
23:35 - locally right now
23:37 - that's equal to you
23:38 - using mph
23:53 - all right so anyway this is what i was
23:54 - looking for the enable the api i just
23:56 - want to double check that we have
23:58 - enabled the proper api
24:04 - shhh
24:23 - okay
24:28 - all right now that that's enabled
24:31 - i'm just gonna try to run this again
24:35 - all right nothing okay let's try these
24:37 - instructions
24:39 - for now just to get something working
24:41 - and um
24:44 - then
24:45 - we can
24:46 - we can move on i mean i think it it may
24:49 - at the very least help us to rule out
24:51 - like where where am i making this
24:53 - mistake at
24:59 - if you haven't already installed g click
25:01 - command line tool
25:09 - all right so there is a gcloud command
25:11 - line tool
25:14 - awesome
25:44 - uh
25:44 - let's see
25:46 - i guess we'll download that real quick
26:10 - um
26:32 - welcome to the cloud sdk yay
26:35 - yes
26:41 - yes
26:52 - great
26:59 - so we just installed this uh google
27:01 - cloud
27:03 - stuff
27:19 - would you like to log in sure
27:33 - take a clog project to use
27:43 - five
28:00 - one
28:05 - all right awesome
28:08 - okay looks like we're all set then to
28:10 - continue on
28:13 - with these instructions and i'm going to
28:16 - minimize these
28:18 - it looks like we're almost ready for
28:20 - question time
28:23 - so
28:25 - i'll hear a little beep soon
28:31 - we done that
28:32 - let's use this quick start
28:43 - all right we've already done this
28:50 - it's details connection since
28:54 - this is connection name we've already
28:55 - done that
28:57 - so you already have copied the instance
28:58 - connection name
29:02 - start the proxy in its own terminal she
29:04 - can modernize output
29:07 - we're going to replace instant
29:08 - connection name
29:13 - all right so let's copy that
29:18 - and replace
29:20 - instance connection
29:22 - name with this
29:43 - i cannot find credentials
30:00 - login
30:07 - i thought we already did this
30:16 - all right then
30:27 - all right let me run this and then we'll
30:28 - do questions
30:30 - hey great
30:34 - wonderful
30:41 - all right so we got
30:44 - down to this step
30:47 - for it to work
30:49 - cool
30:50 - all right so that's like not nearly
30:52 - where we need to be at but it's the
30:54 - first step so
30:56 - let's take a short break and i'm gonna
30:59 - answer some questions
31:14 - uh jeremy asks at a high level what's
31:16 - the value add slash purpose for using
31:19 - the proxy the proxy allows us
31:22 - let me back up so
31:24 - normally you would have an ip address
31:27 - white list and only
31:30 - connect incoming connections from those
31:32 - ip addresses would be allowed
31:34 - for that sql database
31:39 - but we
31:40 - we want to be able to connect to it
31:42 - without having to whitelist an ip
31:44 - address so that's what the proxy enables
31:46 - us to do
31:48 - is to still have incoming connections
31:51 - from whatever ip address
31:54 - and have that work
31:56 - for this particular project we need that
31:58 - because
31:59 - the place where i would like to host
32:02 - wordpress from
32:03 - wordpress needs to communicate with this
32:05 - database
32:07 - with that place
32:09 - is going to have variable ip addresses
32:13 - so
32:14 - that's
32:16 - about as high level as i could make it i
32:17 - guess
32:26 - stephen says so lost but i totally have
32:28 - a video to refer to if i ever need this
32:32 - yeah for sure
32:34 - um
32:36 - world says you have to give google your
32:38 - database passwords um well essentially
32:41 - we've we've created a database with
32:44 - google's cloud sql service
32:47 - so
32:48 - google is running our database
32:50 - so obviously they they have our
32:52 - passwords
32:56 - okay cool
32:59 - oh man i went to grab more coffee and my
33:02 - coffee mug is out of coffee
33:08 - i mean like in the grand scheme of
33:10 - things that's no big deal but
33:12 - really that's kind of like the worst
33:14 - when it happens
33:16 - all right so
33:17 - i don't have any more questions right
33:19 - now so i think i'm gonna go right back
33:21 - into another pomodoro session
33:23 - and
33:24 - i think i only want to do one more
33:25 - pomodoro session i have a lot of
33:27 - paperwork and to do
33:29 - from my last trip
33:31 - um
33:34 - for my last conference
33:37 - and somebody's gonna help me with that
33:38 - since i never remember how to do it
33:40 - right
33:40 - and i also have to pick up my son from
33:42 - school so i have to leave the office
33:44 - early
33:45 - so anyway
33:48 - i want to get some stuff done now as
33:50 - quickly as i can
33:53 - alright so
33:57 - we can test our connection
34:02 - by going
34:04 - replacing username with your
34:07 - mysql username okay cool
34:18 - i always like to
34:20 - edit these
34:21 - oops i guess i forgot to copy i always
34:24 - like to edit these in
34:27 - my code editor
34:30 - username
34:34 - ah shoot
34:39 - let's try this um
34:45 - let's try like that and then i want to
34:47 - put
34:52 - so i want to just go into that wordpress
34:54 - database
34:55 - uh so that's how i'm going to
34:57 - modify that just a bit
35:01 - let's see where am i where do i need to
35:03 - run this
35:04 - here
35:09 - no we're in another spot
35:12 - no i don't know
35:34 - all right let me run it from here
35:38 - ah do i not
35:45 - i'm thinking
35:46 - i thought i had this tab open but i have
35:47 - it open on my laptop right next to me so
35:50 - obviously it's not going to work for
35:52 - right now
35:57 - um
36:01 - let me
36:05 - i need ssh into somewhere else
36:10 - that's my sequel
36:26 - uh
36:46 - do
37:12 - all right i'm installing
37:16 - my sequel
37:17 - really quick
37:22 - on my other screen
37:25 - there we go
37:28 - all right let's see if i have it yet
37:32 - oops
37:36 - let me open up a new one
37:40 - no why is it not found still
37:57 - hmm
38:12 - all right that's not cool
38:16 - i just went through the install process
38:18 - for this and now it's not working
38:35 - hmm
38:51 - hmm
39:01 - all right well
39:06 - let me go back
39:37 - service account
39:58 - definitely skipped this part before
40:03 - hmm
40:16 - all right so we have this proxy running
40:40 - hmm
41:29 - hmm
41:44 - maybe
41:53 - there we go
41:54 - my sequel shell
41:59 - okay
42:12 - all right let's see
42:20 - let's see what i can do then now
42:22 - now that we have this started
42:30 - um
43:07 - all right let's try
43:15 - what
43:16 - oh other way
43:23 - all right cool so it looks like we can
43:25 - use this
43:27 - all right let's try it
43:35 - all right what was the unexpected
43:36 - identifier
43:42 - all right let's try it without this then
43:46 - nah still
44:05 - hmm
44:52 - hmm
45:09 - all right let me
45:12 - let me check this
45:14 - which
45:23 - robocop said if everything worked uh
45:25 - without warning that would be too good
45:27 - to be true yeah for sure i mean
45:31 - i expected that we would have some
45:33 - trouble since i've never attempted
45:34 - anything like this before
45:36 - i do wish that it was going slightly
45:39 - better but
45:46 - see
46:00 - hmm
46:11 - okay jeremy miller saying uh p without a
46:15 - pass
46:16 - without a password
46:18 - let's see
46:21 - still
46:24 - interesting
46:32 - i wonder
46:49 - let me try this one
46:58 - so
47:22 - hmm
47:56 - all right
48:05 - this is
48:06 - kind of a dead end right now
48:09 - hmm
48:25 - i need help
48:27 - troubleshooting
48:29 - it's worth a shot here
49:02 - hmm
49:03 - all right i don't think any of those
49:05 - apply
49:11 - mad duchess says i
49:13 - was saying i had it on unix sockets but
49:16 - it was supposed to be
49:17 - tcp yeah i tried the tcp already and it
49:20 - did not work
49:23 - um
49:24 - i mean maybe
49:36 - other than your presence
49:52 - hmm
50:03 - i mean right now i
50:05 - we just keep getting that error
50:07 - like a syntax error
50:10 - let's see
50:12 - all right cool so i just went there in
50:15 - my browser just to see what would happen
50:17 - so at least
50:18 - we're it's registering
50:35 - oh actually you know what i could use
50:37 - let me try this
50:40 - uh
50:41 - i'll
50:42 - let me open this uh sql operations
50:45 - studio
50:47 - and
50:48 - then i'll see if we can
50:52 - can do this so
50:57 - let's do this and we'll do
51:05 - password
51:11 - and
51:15 - see if this works
51:23 - um
51:25 - not looking good
51:29 - i'm not reading anything here
51:32 - nope
51:36 - server was not found they're not
51:38 - accessible
51:40 - okay
51:45 - shoot
51:57 - i mean i could try
52:06 - okay
52:08 - let me try running it like this
52:29 - hmm
52:50 - hmm
52:53 - uh let's see check stack overflow
52:55 - question
52:57 - all
52:58 - right i'm gonna check this on my other
53:00 - screen
53:01 - quickly
53:33 - uh okay cool i did check out that
53:35 - question so let's try it out
53:38 - all right so evidently
53:41 - that is not working
53:45 - let's go to
53:47 - yeah
53:51 - um
53:53 - wrong way
53:57 - cool there we go
54:21 - oh
54:26 - hmm
54:31 - it's not giving me anything right now
54:33 - let's see if this is
54:36 - showing anything
54:38 - no
54:41 - let's break this out so we can see
54:44 - what's going on here
54:58 - okay
55:09 - maybe i should put in
55:14 - that this might have to add
55:16 - oh
55:18 - jeremy thank you i always mess that up
55:26 - they're not connected
55:29 - um
55:31 - maybe i should put in
55:39 - put this into
55:50 - hmm
56:02 - you guys
56:28 - hmm
56:32 - all right
56:33 - jeremy i'm glad you're i was just
56:35 - reading that in the stack overflow thing
56:37 - uh to do it that way so
56:44 - uh so if it's mysql js we can go
56:50 - connect
56:54 - um
57:08 - and then
57:09 - at
57:22 - zero six
57:25 - yes
57:34 - no
57:36 - all right let me try it with
57:44 - and
57:46 - let me go into lastpass
57:48 - because that password is very long
58:05 - hmm
58:25 - hmm
58:36 - all right well my second pomodoro
58:38 - session
58:40 - just finished
58:53 - i just found someone else who's getting
58:55 - a similar error
59:08 - um
59:42 - stephen says this is a long way from me
59:44 - building front-end sites and client
59:45 - dashboards yeah
59:48 - it's a little different than what we're
59:50 - used to
59:53 - it's cool to do new things though
60:00 - i don't know it's fun definitely
60:02 - stretches the brain a bit
60:05 - hmm
60:08 - well we made some progress today right
60:12 - wasn't
60:14 - definitely not mission accomplished yet
60:17 - but
60:19 - made some progress
60:25 - interesting
60:33 - hmm
60:56 - i was just trying to think just trying
60:58 - to see if there are any flags that i
60:59 - could use
61:10 - hmm
61:24 - uh world says
61:26 - are you afraid that google will give you
61:28 - a bill for like 1k or something for
61:31 - using cloud
61:33 - uh
61:34 - no i'm not really afraid of that
61:36 - you don't want to see how much i've been
61:38 - build so far
61:40 - i don't know
61:41 - let's check it out
61:43 - billing
61:49 - um
61:56 - i guess nothing so far
62:11 - hmm
62:39 - so
62:50 - yeah i guess nothing
62:52 - nothing so far
62:56 - that's cool
63:01 - i mean i had
63:02 - i'd actually only plan on having this up
63:04 - just during yesterday's stream but we
63:07 - didn't get done what i wanted to get
63:08 - done so that's why it's still up
63:17 - uh john hanson says would it be worth
63:20 - trying out your commands
63:22 - in the google cloud show
63:25 - sorry
63:26 - within the google cloud platform console
63:30 - well
63:31 - the thing i was i wanted to do was
63:36 - i wanted to be able to connect
63:42 - from from outside the cons because we
63:44 - you know we already were able to connect
63:47 - using the console
63:49 - in google cloud platform
64:10 - all right i'm just scanning to see if
64:11 - there are any other questions
64:15 - all right uh hodor says i'm looking to
64:18 - make an electron uh and react
64:22 - uh app is you're setting up an electron
64:25 - project still to go to
64:27 - um
64:28 - yeah that's the latest that i've done
64:31 - with electron so
64:34 - check that out and then check out the
64:36 - project
64:41 - excuse me check out the project that
64:44 - we started in that video um
64:47 - the the github repo for that to see
64:50 - where we're at with it
64:53 - uh it's not you know up to date
64:57 - as much
64:58 - up to date as it could be
65:00 - uh but
65:02 - i think
65:03 - it should give you an idea of of how to
65:05 - get started though
65:08 - stephen says you need some coffee yeah i
65:10 - need i need something
65:12 - um
65:14 - all right cool i i need to
65:16 - i need to end the stream and go do my
65:18 - paperwork and stuff before i have to
65:20 - pick up my son
65:22 - so
65:23 - thank you all for watching
65:25 - uh
65:26 - sorry we didn't
65:28 - finish this again
65:31 - i don't know if it was painful watching
65:33 - at all it was a little bit painful for
65:35 - me going through this
65:37 - uh still i mean i still liked learning
65:40 - more about this and figuring some of
65:42 - this stuff out
65:44 - so
65:47 - you know maybe i'll work on a little bit
65:48 - later at home or something like that i
65:50 - kind of don't want to do a whole another
65:52 - stream with this stuff
65:54 - uh so we'll see what happens uh it's
65:56 - tomorrow tomorrow's friday yeah i'll try
65:58 - to do a stream tomorrow number whether i
66:01 - get this working or not i'll try to
66:02 - stream uh about something
66:05 - so
66:07 - uh oh robocop says the best stream by
66:10 - far
66:13 - i don't know if you're being sarcastic
66:15 - or what
66:18 - but uh i don't know maybe it it's better
66:21 - to watch me struggle on on that end um
66:26 - but uh
66:27 - let me see can you get those
66:34 - all right julio sending me something to
66:36 - check out
66:37 - so i will check that out i'm copying and
66:39 - pasting that right now to my browser
66:46 - and
66:48 - thank you let's see isn't it
67:10 - okay
67:11 - all right i'm gonna end the stream for
67:14 - real now thank you all so much for
67:15 - watching and for all your help uh
67:18 - hopefully i'll be back tomorrow
67:20 - and
67:21 - until then
67:23 - uh have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today i'm going to try to fix the problem that we encountered yesterday and there were a few reasons why that was happening and so i'm going to share with you a couple of the reasons and then we're going to try to fix it if you didn't see yesterday's video here's a quick recap of what we tried to do we started up a sql a mysql database on google's cloud platform and we took our wordpress mysql database that we've been using for this project and we made a copy and then we sent that copy over to the new database that we're running on google's cloud platform so the database is there the tables are there we verified that but we couldn't connect we were attempting to host wordpress with now from zeit and we couldn't get it to connect to the database and that's kind of where we left off yesterday so i thought a lot about it i couldn't even though i stopped working i did not stop thinking about that problem which i don't know if that happens to you all but that frequently happens to me like if there's a problem i didn't solve i i just keep thinking about it all the time i think maybe it'd be better if i just worked until i fixed it and then i could be at peace but in this case i think i've found the solution but i haven't had time to test it yet the solution is from what i understand in addition to a few other adjustments we're going to make a proxy because we authorize some ip addresses some networks unfortunately when you host the site with now you don't have an ip address it changes too often so they don't even give you the ip address uh of your your instance of whatever you're running with now so in cases where you can't give them an ip address google's cloud sql offers the option of running a proxy and accessing it like that there's also a further complication that harshit found and that was we were the example we were using to run wordpress with now was assuming that we were using aws and their security so we we may need to go in and disable some of that stuff too but first i definitely want to get this proxy set up so i haven't done this before we're going to go through it together i have the instructions up here somewhere i'm going to paste in a link to the instructions so you all can check that out with me and let's see hey hey everybody uh see there's a few you saying hi yeah let's let's get started so as soon as i find those instructions i'm gonna send them all to you and we're gonna get started so here they are there in the chat now if you have trouble clicking on that to and it doesn't open then try copying and pasting it and let's see all right i'm gonna make sure i have this up on one of my other screens and we can get started with that my computer if my fan is running too loud and that's bothering you let me know i tried closing down as much as i could and i can't figure out what is running uh and causing the fan to uh to run in overdrive like that all right so let me let's move over to the split screen there we are okay harshit is making a pull request right now to fix some of those issues so i'm gonna wait and pull down the latest changes before we do anything on this uh repo that you see here uh and what i'm gonna do instead is go through let's start this timer and let me pull this over here and let's go through some of these instructions try to get this working all right we can see here the proxy what it's going to do for us is it's going to let us access our server our database here without white listing ip addresses so that's what we we can't white list because we don't have you know a static ip address or even really a range that we could set so i guess we could y'all can read this if you want more info but uh the graphics are nice uh so this is how it's going to connect uh instead of going directly to uh cloud sql obviously the proxy lets us go to the proxy and then go to cloud sql so uh pretty simple concept uh i at least i think let me know if it's if it's not i have been reading up on this for a while so if you i may have a slight advantage at understanding it okay all right so we've enabled the api so we did that yesterday we need these gcp authentication credentials so i'm just going to open that another window for right now valid database user account password we set that up yesterday your instance must have an external ip address which we we have alright awesome so let's um let's try this out and try this out on our i'm using a mac right now so let's get to our command line and let me organize this a bit better all right so let's go over to our command line and yeah i'll just open up a new window here all right so we're going to download this great downloaded so quickly and then we're gonna make it executable great we need to provide it with this info so we should have all this info stay to come if you're application we sent the clouds go find credentials here's what's on the cage okay great so impressed okay i'm just scanning over this i think it's always good practice to read all the instructions before doing it um i don't know when i'm cooking it always helps with the recipe if i know what's going to happen ahead of time so i'm not going to read it all i'm just going to scan a bit hmm all right this is good we're gonna they have a github page just for this that we're using which is awesome all right so we are just testing this right now but eventually we would have to go to this step if we end up using this so let's go now i can't find where i left off all right we'll see how do we want to provide these credentials all right you can create a credential file hmm okay all right so we have a few more people joining us for those of you that are joining i just want to reiterate we're going through this process i've never done this before so that's why there's a bit of silence on my part from kind of reading over this i am going to check the chat because it looks like there's a lot in here um okay so it it does look like uh harshit made a pull request there so when the time comes we're gonna to put bringing his pool requests before we attempt to connect everything the wordpress instance to this database um let's see okay i'll go through if you have asked some questions i will uh answer those questions as soon as our pomodoro timer is up so we have about 17 minutes left here uh at this point let me let me paste this in the chat as well and then that way you can check out the tool that we were using that we just loaded that i just loaded locally and i guess for those of you that weren't here earlier here's the page for the instructions we're following okay so here's some example invocations so let's check this out hmm i guess we can try one of these all right so let me try let's move over to here just to change this up so we we do need to replace you need so i'm trying to figure out where they're expecting this to be run from hmm all right let's see all right so i'm not exactly sure let me tell you what i'm i'm thinking right now what i'm not sure about i may just end up copying some stuff and throwing it in the command line just to see if it works uh because we read up here a little earlier i guess up here first it was talking about loading this proxy on your local machine and then it was saying uh something about running it in the google cloud platform console which which i mean that's definitely two different things so i'm trying to to figure out what they want um let's go all right so we have that cloud sql proxy all right good it's not a directory let's see if we can just whenever i just do run run is not a command what's the equivalent command actually maybe i'll just look here okay of course all right so we definitely need default credentials which is what we're trying to do over here i just need to figure out what the credentials are and actually this this will help okay we have this info i'm just gonna grab it from okay and i wonder if this is going to be the database name let's see if this is what they want all right i'm not sure if they want like the main name for the google cloud account or the database username we'll find out all right so let's try this out now what's wordpress command i found all right so obviously that was not what they needed so let's try it again uh shoot it's treating it like two different commands let's see hmm all right just i'm checking back in the chat to see if see if i've lost all of you uh since i'm a bit lost myself all right so i mean at this point i'm just gonna try a few more variations on this uh on this command and see if i can get uh something different to come up uh even if it's a different error message that's going to be progress uh if it doesn't work after a few more tries then i'll just go back to the documentation make sure i didn't miss a step all right you know what let's let me double check this i think there was something yeah maybe since we're doing this locally right now that's equal to you using mph all right so anyway this is what i was looking for the enable the api i just want to double check that we have enabled the proper api shhh okay all right now that that's enabled i'm just gonna try to run this again all right nothing okay let's try these instructions for now just to get something working and um then we can we can move on i mean i think it it may at the very least help us to rule out like where where am i making this mistake at if you haven't already installed g click command line tool all right so there is a gcloud command line tool awesome uh let's see i guess we'll download that real quick um welcome to the cloud sdk yay yes yes great so we just installed this uh google cloud stuff would you like to log in sure take a clog project to use five one all right awesome okay looks like we're all set then to continue on with these instructions and i'm going to minimize these it looks like we're almost ready for question time so i'll hear a little beep soon we done that let's use this quick start all right we've already done this it's details connection since this is connection name we've already done that so you already have copied the instance connection name start the proxy in its own terminal she can modernize output we're going to replace instant connection name all right so let's copy that and replace instance connection name with this i cannot find credentials login i thought we already did this all right then all right let me run this and then we'll do questions hey great wonderful all right so we got down to this step for it to work cool all right so that's like not nearly where we need to be at but it's the first step so let's take a short break and i'm gonna answer some questions uh jeremy asks at a high level what's the value add slash purpose for using the proxy the proxy allows us let me back up so normally you would have an ip address white list and only connect incoming connections from those ip addresses would be allowed for that sql database but we we want to be able to connect to it without having to whitelist an ip address so that's what the proxy enables us to do is to still have incoming connections from whatever ip address and have that work for this particular project we need that because the place where i would like to host wordpress from wordpress needs to communicate with this database with that place is going to have variable ip addresses so that's about as high level as i could make it i guess stephen says so lost but i totally have a video to refer to if i ever need this yeah for sure um world says you have to give google your database passwords um well essentially we've we've created a database with google's cloud sql service so google is running our database so obviously they they have our passwords okay cool oh man i went to grab more coffee and my coffee mug is out of coffee i mean like in the grand scheme of things that's no big deal but really that's kind of like the worst when it happens all right so i don't have any more questions right now so i think i'm gonna go right back into another pomodoro session and i think i only want to do one more pomodoro session i have a lot of paperwork and to do from my last trip um for my last conference and somebody's gonna help me with that since i never remember how to do it right and i also have to pick up my son from school so i have to leave the office early so anyway i want to get some stuff done now as quickly as i can alright so we can test our connection by going replacing username with your mysql username okay cool i always like to edit these oops i guess i forgot to copy i always like to edit these in my code editor username ah shoot let's try this um let's try like that and then i want to put so i want to just go into that wordpress database uh so that's how i'm going to modify that just a bit let's see where am i where do i need to run this here no we're in another spot no i don't know all right let me run it from here ah do i not i'm thinking i thought i had this tab open but i have it open on my laptop right next to me so obviously it's not going to work for right now um let me i need ssh into somewhere else that's my sequel uh do all right i'm installing my sequel really quick on my other screen there we go all right let's see if i have it yet oops let me open up a new one no why is it not found still hmm all right that's not cool i just went through the install process for this and now it's not working hmm hmm all right well let me go back service account definitely skipped this part before hmm all right so we have this proxy running hmm hmm maybe there we go my sequel shell okay all right let's see let's see what i can do then now now that we have this started um all right let's try what oh other way all right cool so it looks like we can use this all right let's try it all right what was the unexpected identifier all right let's try it without this then nah still hmm hmm all right let me let me check this which robocop said if everything worked uh without warning that would be too good to be true yeah for sure i mean i expected that we would have some trouble since i've never attempted anything like this before i do wish that it was going slightly better but see hmm okay jeremy miller saying uh p without a pass without a password let's see still interesting i wonder let me try this one so hmm all right this is kind of a dead end right now hmm i need help troubleshooting it's worth a shot here hmm all right i don't think any of those apply mad duchess says i was saying i had it on unix sockets but it was supposed to be tcp yeah i tried the tcp already and it did not work um i mean maybe other than your presence hmm i mean right now i we just keep getting that error like a syntax error let's see all right cool so i just went there in my browser just to see what would happen so at least we're it's registering oh actually you know what i could use let me try this uh i'll let me open this uh sql operations studio and then i'll see if we can can do this so let's do this and we'll do password and see if this works um not looking good i'm not reading anything here nope server was not found they're not accessible okay shoot i mean i could try okay let me try running it like this hmm hmm uh let's see check stack overflow question all right i'm gonna check this on my other screen quickly uh okay cool i did check out that question so let's try it out all right so evidently that is not working let's go to yeah um wrong way cool there we go oh hmm it's not giving me anything right now let's see if this is showing anything no let's break this out so we can see what's going on here okay maybe i should put in that this might have to add oh jeremy thank you i always mess that up they're not connected um maybe i should put in put this into hmm you guys hmm all right jeremy i'm glad you're i was just reading that in the stack overflow thing uh to do it that way so uh so if it's mysql js we can go connect um and then at zero six yes no all right let me try it with and let me go into lastpass because that password is very long hmm hmm all right well my second pomodoro session just finished i just found someone else who's getting a similar error um stephen says this is a long way from me building frontend sites and client dashboards yeah it's a little different than what we're used to it's cool to do new things though i don't know it's fun definitely stretches the brain a bit hmm well we made some progress today right wasn't definitely not mission accomplished yet but made some progress interesting hmm i was just trying to think just trying to see if there are any flags that i could use hmm uh world says are you afraid that google will give you a bill for like 1k or something for using cloud uh no i'm not really afraid of that you don't want to see how much i've been build so far i don't know let's check it out billing um i guess nothing so far hmm so yeah i guess nothing nothing so far that's cool i mean i had i'd actually only plan on having this up just during yesterday's stream but we didn't get done what i wanted to get done so that's why it's still up uh john hanson says would it be worth trying out your commands in the google cloud show sorry within the google cloud platform console well the thing i was i wanted to do was i wanted to be able to connect from from outside the cons because we you know we already were able to connect using the console in google cloud platform all right i'm just scanning to see if there are any other questions all right uh hodor says i'm looking to make an electron uh and react uh app is you're
