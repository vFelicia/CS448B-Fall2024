00:00 - a lot of people ask me what i do day to
00:02 - day as a web developer one thing for
00:04 - sure i have to do is a daily stand up
00:06 - what's that you say stay tuned to find
00:08 - out
00:10 - [Music]
00:29 - okay so what is a daily stand-up or dsu
00:31 - for short so basically it's when
00:33 - everybody on your project or team
00:35 - gets in a literal circle or they get on
00:38 - a video chat and each person takes turn
00:40 - saying what they're currently working on
00:42 - it's overseen by itpm or project manager
00:45 - and it allows your team to stay on the
00:48 - same page on the project
00:49 - and the structure is simple you
00:51 - basically answer these three questions
00:53 - what did you do yesterday what do you
00:55 - plan to accomplish today and what are
00:57 - your blockers or issues that you are
00:58 - currently having
01:00 - i know my first time doing a dsu i was a
01:02 - little bit scared and if this is
01:03 - sounding scary to you put in the
01:05 - comments below why but hopefully i can
01:07 - give you some examples and we can hash
01:09 - out those fears now
01:10 - so let me give you an example of
01:11 - something you might say during a dsu
01:14 - say you are starting a new app you grab
01:16 - the tags from a combine board which i'll
01:18 - talk about later and your task was to
01:21 - create the home page so you might say
01:24 - yesterday i created the home page today
01:26 - i plan to accomplish applying this
01:29 - styles from the designer
01:31 - and i have no blockers
01:33 - easy right
01:34 - well
01:35 - my first time doing a dsu i was super
01:38 - nervous i swear a little bit i was
01:40 - scared
01:42 - but
01:42 - i think by following these next few tips
01:45 - you will make it successfully through
01:46 - your first esu okay so tip one dsus are
01:50 - usually at the same time every day
01:52 - so that means you can prepare for the
01:54 - dsu by writing down exactly what you're
01:56 - going to say either the day before or
01:59 - the morning before
02:00 - now i usually have uh the notepad app
02:04 - open on my desktop and i just write out
02:06 - what i'm going to say so by time they
02:08 - get to me all i'm doing is reading it
02:10 - out
02:10 - and eventually you're going to use to it
02:12 - and so you won't have to do this anymore
02:14 - but it's definitely a good way to not be
02:16 - nervous
02:17 - tip 2
02:19 - don't be afraid to talk about your
02:20 - blockers now when i first got started i
02:22 - didn't want to seem like i was
02:24 - incompetent so sometimes i wouldn't say
02:26 - what my blockers were but what wound up
02:28 - happening is i would waste time trying
02:30 - to track down the information and all i
02:32 - had to do was ask and somebody could
02:34 - point me in the right direction and
02:36 - that's what dsu's are for it's so that
02:37 - everybody's on the same page and if you
02:39 - do have a blocker then people who know
02:41 - the answer can share that information
02:43 - with you and you don't have to waste any
02:45 - time getting the necessary tools that
02:47 - you need
02:48 - okay so tip number three and the final
02:50 - tip is to listen to your teammates now i
02:53 - know i know you might have a lot of
02:55 - meetings throughout the day and
02:57 - listening to people before you had your
02:59 - coffee might be the hardest thing to do
03:01 - in the world but understand that a dsu
03:03 - is not just there for you to get the
03:05 - information you need but it's also a
03:07 - chance to share information that you
03:09 - have so say yesterday you were working
03:11 - on a problem and you solved it it was
03:13 - easy but today somebody is having a
03:15 - similar issue and now it's your chance
03:18 - to step up and say hey i know exactly
03:20 - what you need let me help you after the
03:22 - dsu
03:23 - or it may just be your itpm saying
03:26 - okay you have you have training that you
03:28 - need to do before the end of this month
03:30 - i want everybody to attack today so we
03:32 - don't have to worry about it later
03:33 - whatever it may be this is an important
03:35 - time to listen to your team and to get
03:37 - what you need to push you through the
03:39 - day
