00:00 - me
00:01 - all right
00:02 - so uh
00:04 - we're gonna talk about building a
00:04 - portfolio today
00:06 - um i've built a lot of portfolios in my
00:08 - life uh it's like what you do in college
00:10 - when you go to art school
00:12 - so i'll give you a little quick
00:13 - background on me
00:15 - i'm a designer i've been working at
00:16 - logistics here in oklahoma city for the
00:19 - past year
00:20 - and we're building some cool stuff and
00:22 - it all deals with lots and lots and lots
00:24 - of data
00:25 - so
00:26 - that's what we're doing i've been
00:28 - designing professionally for about 10
00:29 - years it's like nine and a half or
00:31 - something i just rounded up makes me
00:32 - seem cooler
00:34 - i've been doing design in general since
00:36 - 2004
00:39 - i do know
00:40 - html css and
00:42 - jquery not javascript jquery that's
00:44 - still a thing guys it makes it makes
00:46 - carson really really mad
00:48 - so
00:49 - um if you want to get a rise out of
00:51 - carson ask him up how to do wordpress
00:53 - and jquery and he will he will let you
00:56 - know
00:56 - um so i've built portfolios on paper my
00:59 - first ones were on paper and so it was
01:01 - like a book and we would like make these
01:02 - portfolios and we would put them up on
01:04 - the wall like the pages and uh my
01:07 - professor would come around and she
01:09 - would say
01:10 - that's trash and she'd rip it off the
01:11 - wall and she'd be like you can do better
01:13 - so that's a little you know you guys
01:14 - aren't gonna have that level of uh you
01:16 - like pressure here um i've done flash on
01:19 - how many of you guys have used flash
01:21 - macromedia flash
01:23 - nobody am i that old
01:25 - okay we built it with flash and
01:26 - actionscript you know so things were
01:28 - animated and then i've done them
01:29 - obviously with html css and javascript
01:32 - and i've learned one big thing
01:33 - portfolios are hard
01:36 - portfolios are hard because you're
01:37 - bragging on yourself so it's like you're
01:38 - like look what i can do i'm so great and
01:40 - so they're actually kind of hard
01:42 - so i put a picture of my family up there
01:44 - so that's my wife my daughter and my son
01:47 - my son was going to attack the person
01:49 - taking the picture with the shovel so
01:53 - you know that way if you come back to
01:54 - this slide later you know you know
01:56 - you'll remember who i am
01:59 - all right so let's talk about what a
02:00 - portfolio actually is
02:03 - um because a lot of times people think
02:04 - i'll just throw up a website and that's
02:06 - a portfolio so portfolio is technically
02:08 - it's a collection of your work it's
02:09 - going to show what you can do
02:12 - it should ideally
02:13 - have a way for someone to get in touch
02:15 - with you so maybe an email phone number
02:18 - something like that it should also give
02:19 - a little description of who you are
02:22 - right so think kind of along the lines
02:24 - of a resume like it's gonna give who you
02:26 - are um i would say include as much good
02:29 - work as you can so don't
02:31 - don't just put something up there
02:32 - because you have something if it's bad
02:34 - don't put it up there and kind of going
02:36 - along with that focus on the work you
02:38 - actually want to do so if you're
02:40 - listening to this and you absolutely
02:42 - hate writing javascript and you like to
02:44 - design do not fill your portfolio with
02:46 - javascript because the people that come
02:48 - look at your portfolio are going to say
02:50 - they're really good at javascript and
02:51 - then you're going to get into a job you
02:53 - don't like doing or
02:55 - you won't get a job because your
02:56 - javascript's not that good that would be
02:58 - my case
03:00 - so again portfolios always seem kind of
03:02 - hard because you're bragging about
03:03 - yourself you're talking about yourself
03:05 - but you have to be able to do that you
03:06 - have to kind of talk yourself up you
03:07 - can't be like i'm dirt i don't know what
03:09 - i'm doing because people won't they'll
03:11 - believe you they'll be like okay they're
03:12 - not any good
03:13 - so you have to kind of brag on yourself
03:15 - a little bit
03:16 - um so now let's talk about what a
03:17 - portfolio is not
03:19 - a portfolio a portfolio is not a blog
03:22 - nobody cares about your pinterest
03:23 - recipes or anything like that that
03:25 - people put into blogs this is not a blog
03:28 - so maybe when you get a little bit
03:30 - further along it can be a blog but
03:33 - it's not a blog right now it's also not
03:35 - a collection of photos unless you're a
03:36 - photographer you don't need photos on
03:38 - your website it's not instagram or
03:39 - flickr or any of that stuff so
03:42 - you know keep it keep it kind of focused
03:44 - and next your opinion on absolutely
03:46 - anything nobody cares this is like a
03:48 - resume so i know this is kind of harsh
03:51 - but technology you know nothing about
03:52 - but you have opinions about don't do
03:54 - that no you will make yourself look
03:56 - stupid so don't do that don't talk about
03:58 - religion even if you're religious i'm
04:00 - religious but i keep that off of there
04:02 - because
04:03 - people that are like coming to look at
04:04 - my stuff they may not be and i might
04:06 - offend them so i'm going to keep that
04:07 - off of there politics don't put politics
04:10 - on there because if you're way over on
04:12 - the left you're hiring person may be way
04:14 - over on the right and vice versa so just
04:16 - keep it neutral and don't put any kind
04:19 - of isms on there i've seen this before a
04:20 - lot in the past no isms no racism no
04:23 - sexism no isms just keep it clean keep
04:26 - it simple um
04:29 - no dank memes please and no cat photos
04:32 - because nobody's got time for that
04:35 - see so
04:36 - so i put that in there because you know
04:38 - that's like ironic
04:39 - okay whatever
04:41 - all right so there's different kinds of
04:42 - portfolios you're going to see out there
04:43 - um photography portfolios typically have
04:46 - a lot of pictures and almost no text
04:48 - they're almost always a squarespace
04:50 - template with this grid of pictures and
04:53 - you know they'll be like one word
04:54 - and that'll be it um then there's the
04:56 - videography guys and their theirs are
04:58 - always like so busy and so moving you
05:00 - can't keep up with them and they call
05:01 - those show reels um so lots of youtube
05:04 - clips embedded in there there's written
05:06 - portfolios and those are really boring
05:07 - because it's just lots of text
05:09 - but if you're looking for a writer
05:11 - that's what you want there's design
05:12 - portfolios like mine so those are going
05:14 - to be printed or they're going to be
05:15 - online lots of pictures some text we
05:18 - usually use case studies to explain
05:19 - things like explain why we did what we
05:21 - did
05:22 - and then there's development and on a
05:23 - development we're going to want to see
05:25 - some code a lot of the good ones have
05:27 - code on them so
05:28 - uh remember that
05:30 - um so here's some good examples of
05:32 - portfolios and uh they're out of order
05:34 - because of the way i opened it but uh
05:36 - you know whatever see if we can uh look
05:38 - at that that's awesome
05:40 - let's go back to this okay so
05:42 - we'll start with his one jolie thanks
05:45 - kimberly kimberly sent me a couple of
05:46 - examples from the group and then i have
05:48 - a couple of my friends and then i have
05:50 - mine so we're just gonna scroll through
05:51 - these real quick
05:53 - um i'm gonna tell you why i think
05:54 - they're great
05:56 - um this one's great because he gives us
05:57 - a little example of who he is right he
06:00 - gives us some nice just kind of
06:01 - straightforward what he's done what he
06:03 - can do
06:04 - he has a link to his resume right here
06:06 - which is great because it's a pdf and
06:07 - that means that if i'm a hiring person i
06:10 - can click that link download it and send
06:12 - it to all the people that matter um he
06:14 - also has a picture of himself which is
06:15 - awesome if you have a good picture of
06:16 - yourself put it up there so that way we
06:18 - know what you look like next he has his
06:20 - projects
06:22 - and he's got app and code and i'm afraid
06:24 - that if i click one of these they're
06:25 - going to like mess up
06:28 - it's going to like you know nope all
06:29 - right great so it takes me to github and
06:31 - i can actually like look at his code so
06:33 - that's awesome
06:35 - okay great um so he's got those then he
06:37 - has a contact form so we have a way to
06:39 - get in touch with him
06:40 - uh and then at the bottom
06:42 - uh he has like social stuff so find me
06:45 - elsewhere he's got github
06:46 - and well does this like codepen
06:49 - nope free code cam and then linkedin
06:51 - linkedin is a great one if you're trying
06:52 - to get a job because all the
06:53 - professional people like to hang out on
06:55 - linkedin and uh
06:57 - they really like that for some reason
07:00 - all right we'll go to the next one
07:02 - how do i
07:04 - it's always great when it doesn't work
07:05 - the way i wanted all right this is my
07:07 - friend justin justin battenfield
07:09 - um he started off life as a freelance
07:12 - wordpress developer or something like
07:14 - that
07:15 - and he worked his way up and then he was
07:17 - the lead
07:18 - front-end developer at life church for
07:20 - three or four years and then he came and
07:22 - worked at max and now he is
07:25 - like vp of product or something at tbs
07:27 - factoring
07:28 - his portfolio is really anorexic
07:31 - you can get a hold of his resume up here
07:33 - his work his contact his work will just
07:34 - take you i'm pretty sure it takes you to
07:36 - dribble
07:38 - yep and you can just scroll through
07:40 - dribble and see everything he's done
07:42 - and i can't work chrome apparently
07:45 - um so he just gives you like a really
07:47 - quick
07:48 - little blurb about himself download his
07:51 - resume and then he has
07:53 - twitter linkedin
07:54 - dribble and email
07:57 - so next
08:00 - we're gonna talk about clint clint
08:01 - mcmanaman this is one of my heroes
08:04 - he's been in the design game since like
08:06 - 2002.
08:07 - um
08:09 - so right now his website is pretty much
08:10 - just this straightforward
08:12 - deal but if you click here it takes you
08:14 - to his portfolio proper
08:17 - and he uses case studies to kind of show
08:20 - a lot of the things that he's done
08:23 - which he's done a lot of things
08:27 - so i like his because it's
08:30 - just really clean it's really
08:31 - straightforward
08:33 - he gives you a headline that explains
08:35 - pretty much everything he's all about if
08:37 - you follow him on any social media
08:38 - that's what you're going to get
08:40 - so he's pretty straightforward and i
08:41 - like that
08:42 - so if you'll notice like things are
08:44 - really simple they're really kind of
08:46 - just straightforward and i know these
08:48 - guys are mostly designers
08:49 - and then we have a maya
08:51 - right
08:52 - all right is that is that embarrassing
08:54 - to like have yours like thrown up there
08:56 - all right now i really like this again
08:58 - you give a really quick just what you
09:00 - can do you're not like
09:02 - reaching out there and saying you can
09:04 - you know operate microsoft office or
09:06 - something which is i've seen that
09:09 - we have a great little gallery of
09:11 - projects
09:12 - um
09:14 - and then we have them over here on
09:15 - codepen which is awesome because this
09:17 - proves to me that you did this it's on
09:19 - codepen so i can go see what you've done
09:21 - it's awesome
09:24 - and then we have and i like this we have
09:26 - a resume download the resume but we also
09:28 - have the certificate so this gives
09:30 - validity to the claims that you're
09:33 - making that hey
09:34 - i have a certificate that proves that i
09:36 - can do what i say i'm doing then we have
09:39 - contact information
09:40 - so there's there's a few examples i'm
09:42 - going to go back over here now
09:44 - oh i guess we can look at mine i just
09:46 - went through mine and rebuilt it
09:49 - so i love the mountains so i have
09:50 - mountains i have a blurb about my
09:53 - professional self and my personal self
09:56 - i have a little section about what i do
09:58 - and i have three
09:59 - big projects that i've done
10:02 - i'm gonna write case studies for those
10:03 - later
10:04 - and then i have a little chat form
10:07 - so
10:08 - mine's kind of anorexic but
10:10 - there it is all right so if we come back
10:12 - here
10:15 - technology so great when it works all
10:18 - right so my thing that i would say is
10:20 - remember to focus on the job to be done
10:22 - rather than the style it's really easy
10:24 - when you're trying to represent yourself
10:26 - to like get hung up on how things look
10:28 - or whatever like remember that the
10:30 - people that are visiting your site have
10:32 - a job to be done and that is to learn
10:34 - about you and to contact you so remember
10:36 - that and make sure they can easily
10:39 - do that
10:40 - all right so let's talk about the
10:41 - building blocks to include to make your
10:44 - portfolio awesome
10:46 - everybody wants to do that right
10:49 - all right so include your work that's
10:51 - gonna be really important it's not a
10:53 - portfolio if you don't it's just like a
10:55 - little web page so
10:57 - give me work that you've completed right
10:59 - you want to make sure that it's done
11:01 - that you can show it off
11:03 - maybe try some work that challenged you
11:05 - maybe it was something that was really
11:06 - hard
11:08 - and maybe you can explain why that was
11:10 - hard and how you got over it
11:13 - maybe try some work in progress like if
11:15 - it's okay with your employer or if
11:17 - you're just doing things on the side you
11:19 - can put work in progress and you can
11:20 - explain where you're at and where you're
11:22 - going
11:24 - you want to do work that showcases your
11:26 - skill so like the skills that you're
11:28 - focusing on that's what you want to show
11:31 - like i'm not going to cram my portfolio
11:33 - full of code because code is secondary
11:35 - to design for me so i'm going to go
11:37 - design something and then i'll code it
11:38 - and i don't really care
11:41 - how the code looks
11:42 - well i care but that's a different talk
11:45 - so
11:46 - make sure you also do work that you want
11:47 - to do again if you i mean focus on what
11:50 - you're after right don't
11:53 - don't focus on things because i said to
11:56 - do it or because daniel said to do it
11:58 - and especially if carson says to do it
12:00 - no i'm kidding guys carson's great i
12:02 - just had to do i just had to give him a
12:03 - little dig um but yeah put work you want
12:06 - to do on there like if you're like i
12:08 - said if you want to focus on ui ux then
12:10 - go figure that out if you want to focus
12:12 - on development go figure that out if you
12:14 - want to do like
12:16 - machine learning go figure that out um
12:18 - you know focus on what you want to do be
12:20 - you right so try to put your best foot
12:22 - forward with your work you want quality
12:25 - over quantity um
12:27 - you know show them what you know what
12:28 - you're doing
12:29 - i would say quality over quantity
12:31 - because i don't want to scroll through a
12:32 - bunch of stuff that doesn't look very
12:34 - good that isn't complete that you don't
12:35 - really care about i'd rather see three
12:36 - things that you care about than 10
12:38 - things you don't
12:40 - all right so show your work that's the
12:43 - next one consider using case studies so
12:46 - that is a like laying out and saying
12:48 - this was the problem this was our
12:50 - essentially our hypothesis this was how
12:52 - we approached it and this is the results
12:54 - that's really good because it shows the
12:56 - thought process behind it not just i
12:58 - copied code from here and pasted code to
13:00 - here and it worked i don't know why you
13:02 - want to show why
13:04 - explain the technology stack you used
13:06 - you know why why did you use
13:09 - react overview or why didn't you use
13:11 - wordpress when it was a cms or why did
13:14 - you use whatever you used explain why
13:17 - instead of just saying i use these
13:19 - technologies and putting the cute little
13:20 - icons like great you use those use those
13:23 - on every project why did you choose that
13:26 - explain problems you ran into so like if
13:28 - you're working on something and you had
13:30 - a problem and it was essentially a show
13:32 - stopper how did you get around that did
13:33 - you ask for help did you stay up till
13:35 - midnight trying to figure it out
13:37 - how did you solve that problem the
13:39 - reason i am stressing this one is
13:41 - because it demonstrates that you're a
13:42 - problem solver and not just a
13:45 - you know hanging out on stack overflow
13:47 - which is sort of problem solving in my
13:49 - case
13:51 - but
13:52 - it shows that you know what you're doing
13:53 - and you know how to go beyond just
13:56 - the specs you can actually get out there
13:58 - and kind of solve problems
14:00 - so think about soft skills
14:02 - demonstrating those like
14:04 - who did you have to talk to to get the
14:06 - specs like how did you figure out what
14:08 - the problem was that you had to to
14:10 - accomplish these are these are like soft
14:11 - skills that a hiring person is going to
14:13 - want to like hear about
14:15 - and i wouldn't say like list them out
14:16 - like a bullet point maybe it's how you
14:18 - describe the problem and like maybe the
14:20 - problem was
14:22 - you know we
14:23 - my company acquired this job and i was
14:26 - required to talk to these people and
14:28 - then i had to talk to this person to
14:30 - figure out what the users were after and
14:33 - therefore i chose this technology stack
14:36 - and we ran into this problem and this is
14:37 - how we solved it and that's all just in
14:39 - a short maybe couple paragraphs you know
14:42 - and then you have screenshots and maybe
14:43 - some code pin
14:45 - embeds showing the code and that's just
14:47 - an idea
14:49 - you might also think about explaining
14:50 - how you organize your work how do you
14:52 - organize your tasks you know like what
14:54 - kind of what kind of organizational
14:55 - system do you use that shows that you
14:57 - know how to organize your life and
14:58 - you're not living out of a suitcase
15:01 - there's nothing wrong with living out a
15:02 - suitcase if you do but
15:03 - employers don't want your code that way
15:06 - because it's really hard to come back to
15:09 - all right so think of your portfolio as
15:11 - a resume with some personality um i know
15:14 - a while back it was really cool to do
15:16 - like these little catchy res like
15:18 - portfolios that were
15:20 - full of trendy verbiage but
15:23 - people aren't really after that so do
15:26 - include your resume someplace to
15:27 - download like i said
15:30 - hiring people want to download that and
15:31 - they want to share it with the people in
15:33 - their group um the people that matter
15:36 - do include a link to something like
15:38 - linkedin that's a great
15:40 - place to
15:41 - send people for professional stuff they
15:43 - love it
15:45 - do give us a little about section so we
15:47 - can learn about you that's a great idea
15:49 - so that uh you know i know you're a real
15:51 - person and you know not just something
15:53 - thrown up there
15:54 - i would say keep it professional but add
15:56 - just a little bit of your personality i
15:57 - mean think about what kind of colors do
15:59 - you like what kind of pictures do you
16:00 - like what kind of how do you word things
16:03 - i mean don't you don't want to be a
16:04 - robot you want to have some fun with it
16:06 - like it's not
16:07 - it's not like a science experiment or
16:08 - something you want to have some fun
16:10 - um so give me a way to contact you and
16:13 - you would be surprised how many people
16:15 - forget this piece like if you're putting
16:18 - a portfolio up there and your goal is to
16:20 - get
16:21 - a job or get side gigs i need a way to
16:24 - get a hold of you and a lot of people
16:25 - sometimes forget that i know that sounds
16:27 - silly but make sure you have an email um
16:30 - i would say have a phone number but when
16:31 - i had a phone number on my website i got
16:33 - so many spam calls so you know if you
16:36 - want your phone number that's fine um
16:39 - social media is fine but use it with
16:41 - caution
16:42 - so i have a note about social media and
16:44 - this is coming from me observing other
16:46 - people
16:47 - keep your social media private so that
16:48 - it's your social network and not the
16:51 - world
16:52 - but if you do want to share with the
16:53 - world keep it neutral
16:56 - so maybe if you're going to put your
16:57 - twitter on there and you're a religious
16:59 - person don't
17:00 - put a ton of like opinionated religious
17:03 - stuff on there and if you're a political
17:05 - person don't
17:06 - put your political ideas out there i
17:08 - mean we talked about this a second ago
17:09 - and i'm stressing it for a reason
17:12 - don't put any illegal stuff you know if
17:14 - you're out smoking big doinks in amish
17:16 - we don't need to see that especially if
17:18 - you want a job
17:19 - put no isms again no racism no sexism
17:22 - none of that please don't even give your
17:24 - opinion on it because
17:25 - you can assume if you put it on the
17:27 - internet
17:28 - if somebody's looking to hire you they
17:30 - will find it and you can assume that if
17:32 - it's borderline
17:34 - offensive it will offend them just
17:35 - assume those things and also assume that
17:38 - if you put it on the internet it will
17:39 - never ever ever go away and it will come
17:41 - back to haunt you in 10 years just
17:43 - assume those things they may not be true
17:45 - but assume them because
17:47 - people are going to search for you
17:49 - they're going to google you they're
17:50 - going to do all sorts of stuff they're
17:51 - not just going to look at your website
17:52 - and go that was cool let's hire them
17:53 - they're going to they're going to dig
17:55 - into your past so that's what they do
17:58 - all right here's a few things to
18:00 - consider as we kind of wrap up
18:02 - and these are just my opinions so
18:04 - whatever
18:05 - consider who your end user is going to
18:07 - be and this is where i always start um
18:10 - who are you going to build this for is
18:11 - it for somebody who's going to be
18:13 - employing you either as a contractor or
18:15 - as a job
18:16 - are you building it for your peers kind
18:18 - of like the people in this room is it
18:19 - kind of just to show off what you can do
18:21 - are you just building it for yourself
18:23 - just to have something
18:25 - all three of those things are going to
18:26 - have different outcomes
18:28 - when you're done building it um so as
18:30 - you kind of identify who you're building
18:32 - it for think about where they're at
18:33 - right now like what kind of position are
18:35 - they in um you know if it's a if it's a
18:38 - hiring person they're going to be a kind
18:39 - of a they're probably going to be a
18:40 - business person they're going to be kind
18:42 - of coming across your site you know at
18:44 - work so
18:45 - you can think about that
18:47 - think about their background because
18:49 - that's going to give you a really big
18:50 - idea into what they're expecting so if
18:52 - they're if they're this gentleman on the
18:54 - right that likes haha business he's
18:56 - going to expect certain things whereas
18:57 - if it's me i'm going to expect something
18:59 - else from your site
19:01 - so if you think about who is going to be
19:03 - coming to your site and you're going to
19:05 - think about what their background is
19:06 - you'll know kind of how to
19:09 - you know tailor your website to get the
19:11 - result that you want
19:14 - all right so again kind of diving more
19:15 - into that
19:16 - what is your end user looking for um
19:18 - what kind of position are you going for
19:20 - are you going to be a developer a leader
19:22 - or are you just a haha business person
19:24 - and those people seriously exist they
19:26 - run meetings and they
19:28 - they go to meetings and they talk about
19:30 - meetings and they talk about getting
19:31 - stuff done and they have meetings about
19:32 - getting stuff done and they never
19:33 - actually do anything but they love it so
19:36 - what kind of position are you going for
19:38 - um and you'll kind of want to tailor
19:39 - your site for that
19:41 - um
19:42 - again think about what what's their job
19:43 - to be done when they're coming to your
19:45 - website what are they looking for are
19:47 - they looking for your work or are they
19:48 - looking for you know what are they
19:50 - looking for
19:51 - typically they want to know about you
19:52 - and they want to see your work and then
19:53 - they want to be able to contact you
19:55 - if they want to and you're looking at
19:57 - maybe 30 seconds before they make that
19:59 - decision if you're lucky
20:02 - so why would these people be visiting
20:03 - your site is it because you applied for
20:05 - a job is it because they just saw you in
20:08 - a forum somewhere
20:10 - is it because you you know like taped it
20:12 - to their door i don't know i wouldn't do
20:14 - that
20:15 - these qr codes are they're not cool
20:17 - anymore
20:19 - all right how did they find you did did
20:21 - somebody pass them your website was it
20:23 - like you know like in a chat that they
20:25 - copy and paste it check this out did
20:26 - they find you like through a user group
20:28 - type thing i mean these are all going to
20:30 - kind of
20:32 - dictate
20:33 - you know how they approach your site so
20:36 - i would say have empathy for your end
20:38 - user and make it really easy for them to
20:40 - find what they're looking for
20:41 - because you're helping them
20:44 - like you if you do that remember that
20:46 - they have a job to do and they want to
20:47 - do it quickly nobody wants to hunt for
20:49 - things even if you think it's clever
20:52 - they don't so make it easy for them to
20:54 - find what they're looking for
20:55 - all right and finally just remember your
20:57 - portfolio doesn't have to be perfect um
21:00 - i've struggled with this a lot in my
21:01 - life and a lot of people i've talked to
21:03 - especially when i remember when we were
21:04 - in college it had to be perfect
21:06 - it doesn't have to be perfect build it
21:08 - to your current skill level if you're
21:10 - trying to be a developer and you can
21:12 - only write html and css that's fine you
21:15 - can build a portfolio
21:18 - just
21:18 - build it make sure it gets out there
21:21 - keep it simple
21:22 - you don't need a ton of like fancy
21:24 - animations or fancy effects or whatever
21:28 - just keep it simple remember what you're
21:30 - trying to accomplish with it
21:32 - and make it easy to use but have fun
21:34 - doing it that's the other thing like if
21:36 - you want to put some some fancier things
21:38 - in there to kind of show your skills and
21:39 - have fun doing it that's fine too just
21:42 - don't feel like you have to um number
21:45 - one thing is get it done
21:46 - um because like a resume this is kind of
21:48 - like the you know the electronic resume
21:50 - essentially like you're
21:52 - putting yourself out there and saying
21:53 - here i am this is what i can do
21:56 - um so if you feel struck at all i put
21:58 - this quote up here that's what's been
21:59 - really big for me lately um it's by
22:02 - marcus aurelius the roman emperor he
22:04 - says the impediment to action advances
22:06 - action what stands in the way becomes
22:08 - the way so
22:09 - building a portfolio is hard because you
22:11 - have to brag about yourself you have to
22:13 - handle
22:14 - writing all the body copy for the
22:16 - website you have to think about doing
22:18 - this and that and it has to be
22:19 - professional but it makes you a better
22:22 - developer and a better professional
22:24 - for doing it
22:26 - bye right
22:29 - all right does anybody have any
22:30 - questions and anybody
22:35 - yes
22:52 - right okay she's asking um for me to
22:55 - repeat talking about case studies
22:57 - specifically like what goes into case
22:59 - studies
23:00 - um case studies typically highlight
23:03 - a project you're working on so
23:05 - let's say you were building a project
23:07 - and you had to make a form for the first
23:09 - time right so you were you were
23:11 - responsible for building a form that
23:14 - took in a certain amount of information
23:16 - and sent it somewhere
23:18 - so you wouldn't highlight the whole
23:19 - project you might say within this
23:21 - project that i was working on at work
23:24 - and you might give a little bit of
23:25 - background about the project
23:27 - you would say my task was to build this
23:29 - form
23:30 - and so you would say i started by
23:32 - researching the forms and we we came to
23:35 - figure out this was what information was
23:37 - needed you know maybe it was the
23:38 - person's name an email and a short
23:40 - message i mean this is really simple um
23:43 - and so you talked about how
23:45 - you had a certain technology you were
23:46 - using and you had to go figure out how
23:48 - to pull those things in
23:50 - when the form was submitted and you had
23:52 - to talk about how you
23:55 - captured that that stuff in the database
23:57 - and like alerted whoever needed to be
23:59 - alerted and so
24:01 - along the way you can talk about then
24:03 - you can put in code snippets you can put
24:05 - in screenshots you could put in
24:08 - screen captures like video
24:10 - and then you can kind of elaborate into
24:13 - the results so like maybe the results
24:15 - were because of this
24:18 - people were able to ask for help which
24:20 - increased
24:22 - productivity x percent
24:24 - that's typically kind of what you see
24:26 - on most case studies and i'm coming from
24:29 - a design background a little bit so it
24:30 - is kind of like problem solution result
24:34 - is kind of what you can boil that down
24:35 - to
24:36 - um was did that help to answer your
24:39 - question
24:40 - great
24:41 - anybody else
24:47 - no
24:48 - oh
24:50 - go ahead
24:51 - no you're fine it's daniel go ahead
24:58 - type of job um
25:00 - work you want to do on your landing page
25:07 - your portfolio is passed down
25:09 - the more in depth
25:13 - but i also heard that you should have
25:14 - like
25:16 - additional work to show if you're asked
25:19 - is that something you've heard before
25:21 - and like
25:22 - would you suggest to have
25:24 - like
25:24 - more depth work on the side so she's
25:28 - asking about like
25:30 - and you can correct me if i'm wrong
25:32 - you're asking about keywords
25:34 - and extra work is that okay so she's
25:36 - kind of asking about like keywords and
25:38 - and having more than just what what's on
25:40 - your portfolio
25:41 - so keywords i don't really know about
25:43 - that's kind of like black magic to me
25:45 - that gets into like seo territory which
25:47 - is not something i'm
25:49 - very familiar with um
25:51 - but as far as having extra work yes you
25:54 - will want extra work for an interview i
25:56 - would say on your portfolio online maybe
25:59 - putting your best foot forward
26:01 - but then having somewhere maybe github
26:03 - maybe codepen
26:05 - if you're into design maybe dribble or
26:06 - behance
26:08 - some place where you can stash other
26:10 - work and it's not that that works bad
26:12 - it's just that you haven't chosen to
26:14 - highlight it as a quote case study um
26:18 - because case studies take a lot of work
26:19 - like you really have to kind of dig in
26:20 - and think about why you did what you did
26:22 - and you have to go track down the
26:24 - results and stuff like that so they
26:25 - actually take a lot of work so maybe
26:27 - it's not that that works bad and as much
26:29 - as it's just
26:30 - you didn't want to do that you know what
26:32 - i'm saying so yes when you get into an
26:34 - interview people are going to want to be
26:36 - able to see the different skills that
26:37 - you have and they're going to want to
26:38 - see different types of work that you've
26:40 - done
26:41 - and they're going to see that you're
26:42 - flexible and they're going to want to
26:43 - see that you can problem solve and so by
26:45 - having more work to pull out and show
26:48 - that might not be on your website you
26:49 - show just that so did that answer your
26:52 - questions
27:00 - um
27:11 - that's a really good question and that's
27:12 - a really hard question i would say
27:16 - at least in my case what i've done is
27:18 - i've either asked the client and said is
27:20 - it cool if i show this
27:22 - you know on my portfolio and you you
27:24 - know you can if you can demonstrate to
27:26 - them a lot of times that you're not
27:28 - going to give away any trade secrets or
27:30 - anything like that they will a lot of
27:31 - times say yes if you ask them if not the
27:35 - other thing i've had to do in the past
27:36 - is to essentially recreate the project
27:39 - by changing enough stuff that i can so
27:41 - that it's basically not that project
27:43 - because really what you're what you're
27:44 - trying to say is here's a problem and
27:46 - here's how i solved it
27:48 - and so if it's a fake company and fake
27:50 - data
27:52 - you you're still solving that problem
27:54 - and i mean you can probably in an
27:56 - interview you can explain
27:59 - your situation and they're gonna be
28:00 - they're going to be cool with it
28:02 - you kind of have to be creative in how
28:04 - you solve that problem because that's a
28:05 - problem in and of itself
28:09 - anybody else
28:17 - uh
28:33 - where's the happy medium the happy
28:34 - medium is if you can look at the website
28:37 - and say
28:39 - it communicates what you want it to
28:41 - communicate so if you need a header
28:44 - and a picture and one paragraph tag
28:47 - you're done you did it um
28:49 - you know maybe you can get in with a few
28:51 - extra stuff but
28:53 - the
28:54 - i've heard this over and over and over
28:55 - again and i always kind of struggle with
28:57 - it because nobody wants to follow it but
29:00 - the rule is this nobody reads anything
29:02 - on the internet i mean think about it
29:03 - when was the last time you read you
29:05 - seriously read anything on the internet
29:07 - i mean and i'm not talking about like
29:08 - you you saw an interesting article you
29:10 - chose to read i'm talking about as you
29:12 - browse the internet somebody sends you a
29:14 - link what's the first thing you do you
29:15 - scroll you look at headers you look at
29:17 - pictures and if it's interesting you
29:20 - might read the first sentence of a
29:21 - paragraph so that's how people typically
29:24 - consume websites and you have to
29:25 - remember that like
29:26 - if someone sends my portfolio to a
29:29 - hiring person they're not going to read
29:31 - it until they think i'm interesting
29:32 - they're going to scroll through there
29:33 - they're going to find my work and
29:34 - they're going to go look at my work and
29:35 - they're going to go ah this is not what
29:36 - we want or oh that's so perfect that's
29:38 - what we want and then they'll go back
29:39 - and read it and if they decide they
29:41 - don't like me they probably just
29:42 - couldn't close the tab and that was it
29:44 - so
29:45 - the happy medium is saying i want to
29:47 - communicate this message and this is
29:49 - what it takes to do it and when it comes
29:51 - to writing
29:53 - i've always heard you want to keep it
29:54 - about a sixth grade level
29:56 - and you want to write
29:58 - out your message and then rewrite it and
30:00 - then rewrite it and then rewrite it and
30:02 - then rewrite it and make it as simple as
30:04 - possible
30:05 - um
30:06 - you know and then basically whatever you
30:08 - have cut it in half and rewrite it again
30:10 - because that's how writing goes and
30:12 - that's why i'm not a writer because it's
30:14 - kind of hard but um there's tools for
30:17 - that
30:18 - but does that
30:19 - answer your question or
30:21 - awesome
30:23 - anybody else
30:25 - oh
30:27 - from twitch
30:43 - how would i show a portfolio in a
30:45 - portfolio project i'm working on with
30:47 - someone else is that
30:58 - oh i didn't do the entire thing
31:00 - okay
31:01 - i would highlight the pieces that i did
31:03 - do and i would not be shy to say i
31:05 - worked with another person
31:08 - or you know maybe even name them if
31:10 - they're cool with it
31:12 - and i would basically say i worked on
31:13 - this piece and then so and so worked on
31:16 - this piece and then i took it back and
31:18 - worked on this piece and you know you
31:21 - that's actually really good because it
31:22 - shows that you can work in a team
31:24 - environment and that you can communicate
31:26 - you know back and forth and password
31:27 - back and forth
31:44 - like
31:46 - say
31:47 - uh
32:00 - [Music]
32:02 - so so
32:04 - you're asking about what do you do with
32:05 - like skill sets so like if you have a
32:07 - bunch of different skills
32:08 - how do you demonstrate that okay
32:11 - i would say like in a development
32:14 - environment it's probably okay to list
32:16 - out i know these languages um because
32:17 - that's really one of the best ways to
32:19 - show that um but if you can back that up
32:21 - with some projects and be like in this
32:22 - project i use c sharp and in this
32:24 - project i use javascript and this u in
32:25 - this project i use php and if you can
32:27 - like demonstrate that that's even better
32:29 - because then it's not just a list of
32:31 - things that you quote know
32:34 - it's actually demonstrating that you
32:35 - know how to do that
32:37 - i typically don't list out skill sets
32:40 - because in the design world it's kind of
32:41 - become a it doesn't matter it's like oh
32:43 - you can write some code and you can do
32:44 - wireframes and you can do mock-ups so
32:46 - that's it and my portfolio already
32:48 - demonstrates that so it's like i don't
32:50 - have to do that so that was a great
32:51 - question
32:52 - yeah i would actually probably list
32:54 - those out somewhere
33:07 - it's a it's a static web page i use
33:10 - dribble to host my work and then i link
33:13 - out to that
33:15 - i use jekyll and it works with github
33:17 - pages so it's like free hosting so
33:20 - you make a gh pages branch and you
33:23 - push your code up there and then it
33:25 - point the you buy a domain name and you
33:27 - point it to that dns and it works so
33:30 - so yeah it's static um i don't i don't
33:33 - do much
33:34 - in that way
33:35 - you were gonna ask a question
33:49 - so you're totally asking let me see
33:51 - you're asking if i use behance as a and
33:53 - dribble as a supplement or as my
33:56 - portfolio right yeah okay i actually use
33:58 - that as my portfolio
34:00 - both of them now have a feature where
34:03 - you they like make you a little web page
34:05 - and so i built the web page that i
34:07 - showed you guys let me i'll pull it back
34:09 - up actually
34:11 - if i can figure out how to work google
34:13 - chrome because apparently i don't know
34:15 - how to work google chrome
34:18 - there we go okay so i built this page
34:20 - and then all of these things link to
34:23 - dribble and so i've created dribble
34:25 - projects
34:27 - and then in the descriptions i talk
34:28 - about what i'm doing there and why i'm
34:30 - doing things and then you have all the
34:31 - different
34:33 - things and then when i say see more work
34:35 - that just links to my all my dribble
34:37 - feed
34:39 - so there's a lot of things in here that
34:40 - are not too bad but i didn't put them in
34:42 - there as a case study
34:44 - just because it didn't really matter to
34:45 - me so that's how i'm using that and that
34:48 - going back to your question that means
34:49 - because i'm using an outside source i
34:51 - don't have to use a database
34:54 - and i can just use a static page to just
34:56 - host some information so
34:59 - yes
35:03 - all right
35:04 - sorry you want to see the project right
35:15 - i'm actually i don't know i want to make
35:17 - case studies i haven't done it because
35:18 - they're time-consuming um
35:21 - so i've put these
35:22 - you know i have
35:24 - basically my last three major
35:25 - employments and i have examples from
35:28 - there from things i'm doing so this is
35:29 - stuff i'm currently working on
35:31 - um and it and inside of this stuff here
35:35 - it kind of explains like each post i'm
35:37 - explaining what the post is about and
35:39 - like what what kind of problems it's
35:41 - solving
35:42 - um so it's sort of a case study but it's
35:45 - not like a traditional case study i
35:47 - think if you were to read through that
35:49 - you would actually kind of get a grasp
35:50 - for what i'm talking about like what's
35:52 - what what the what the the picture
35:54 - actually means
35:55 - so i should probably do a better job of
35:57 - actually making a page for a case study
35:59 - but i was lazy and i have a lot going on
36:02 - so i just linked to that
36:08 - so remember that i'm a designer
36:11 - so everything is about the end picture
36:13 - and showing you how i got to that
36:16 - whereas if you're writing code it's
36:18 - about how you built that thing
36:21 - so there is there is kind of a
36:22 - difference there
36:25 - any other questions
36:29 - no
36:31 - no
36:34 - that's a good question um i tried to get
36:36 - stewarthines.com and a realtor
36:39 - in amarillo texas had it and i was
36:42 - really upset and so i got stuart heinz
36:44 - not me
36:45 - and that's how i chose my domain name
36:52 - sorry i don't have any dnd references
36:55 - daniel back there
37:00 - all right is there any other questions
37:03 - nope
37:06 - i'm sorry
37:09 - you're asking what i used for my contact
37:11 - form
37:12 - it's called formly
37:14 - and it's
37:15 - form l-y or something i i don't know i
37:18 - just typed in a
37:20 - contact form for static website and
37:22 - there was like two or three and i picked
37:23 - formally because it was open source and
37:25 - free
37:26 - um so i don't know how well it works it
37:29 - works when i submit one myself so
37:32 - i guess we'll see i guess everybody can
37:33 - go spam it right now and send me emails
37:35 - and we'll see how that works
37:38 - that'd be kind of fun
37:41 - any other questions
37:54 - oh
37:55 - so you're asking about
37:56 - like uh when i said don't give your
37:58 - opinion on technologies
38:00 - all right i'll explain that a little bit
38:01 - further yo go ahead sorry
38:05 - um
38:13 - right
38:23 - the only reason i say don't push your
38:25 - opinion on things is because
38:29 - your opinion
38:30 - is
38:31 - a lot of times what i've learned your
38:32 - opinion and so while your opinion may be
38:35 - right most of the time it might not be
38:36 - right all the time and you may offend
38:39 - someone wanting to hire you or work with
38:41 - you just by your opinion and you may
38:43 - never even know it because they were
38:44 - reading your blog and they were like oh
38:46 - he's so opinionated about this one thing
38:48 - that i just can't get over i mean it's
38:50 - silly
38:51 - but it's trying to take that path of
38:53 - like least resistance because as soon as
38:54 - you try to say that you know about
38:56 - something people are going to come out
38:57 - of the woodwork to tell you you don't
38:59 - you know and it's so it's just like when
39:00 - i i always look at a portfolio like a
39:02 - resume kind of so it's like i'm trying
39:04 - to be as neutral as possible
39:07 - but if you
39:08 - know a lot about something and you can
39:11 - prove you know a lot about something
39:13 - then go ahead
39:14 - i would say
39:16 - by linking to something like having a
39:17 - medium account that's kind of become the
39:19 - new like blog platform and like just
39:21 - linking to that on off your site would
39:22 - be fine if you like to write about tech
39:25 - but i've seen a lot of people and myself
39:28 - included when i was younger
39:30 - just giving my opinion about stuff and
39:32 - then when you look at it five years
39:34 - later you're like
39:35 - man i was dumb
39:38 - or you read somebody and you're like
39:39 - yeah you're a total noob you don't know
39:40 - what you're talking about you know like
39:42 - so it's like you want to just be really
39:43 - careful when you put your opinion out
39:45 - there that's all that's all i mean by
39:47 - that it might have seemed a little
39:49 - strong but
40:13 - yeah i yeah
40:15 - i think both of you right on that she
40:17 - was saying you know that a company may
40:18 - see that you were writing about
40:19 - something and decided you were totally
40:21 - stuck on that one thing and he was
40:22 - saying if you write in a neutral way
40:23 - then it'd be okay and i think you're
40:25 - both right on that like
40:27 - you know just
40:28 - i don't know just be careful when you're
40:30 - posting your opinion is i guess i guess
40:32 - the sum of that
40:34 - all right anybody else got anything
40:38 - oh
40:39 - all right
40:40 - so uh good luck making your portfolios
40:43 - and uh we'll see you next time does
40:46 - somebody have announcements
40:47 - announcements okay
40:49 - yay

Cleaned transcript:

me all right so uh we're gonna talk about building a portfolio today um i've built a lot of portfolios in my life uh it's like what you do in college when you go to art school so i'll give you a little quick background on me i'm a designer i've been working at logistics here in oklahoma city for the past year and we're building some cool stuff and it all deals with lots and lots and lots of data so that's what we're doing i've been designing professionally for about 10 years it's like nine and a half or something i just rounded up makes me seem cooler i've been doing design in general since 2004 i do know html css and jquery not javascript jquery that's still a thing guys it makes it makes carson really really mad so um if you want to get a rise out of carson ask him up how to do wordpress and jquery and he will he will let you know um so i've built portfolios on paper my first ones were on paper and so it was like a book and we would like make these portfolios and we would put them up on the wall like the pages and uh my professor would come around and she would say that's trash and she'd rip it off the wall and she'd be like you can do better so that's a little you know you guys aren't gonna have that level of uh you like pressure here um i've done flash on how many of you guys have used flash macromedia flash nobody am i that old okay we built it with flash and actionscript you know so things were animated and then i've done them obviously with html css and javascript and i've learned one big thing portfolios are hard portfolios are hard because you're bragging on yourself so it's like you're like look what i can do i'm so great and so they're actually kind of hard so i put a picture of my family up there so that's my wife my daughter and my son my son was going to attack the person taking the picture with the shovel so you know that way if you come back to this slide later you know you know you'll remember who i am all right so let's talk about what a portfolio actually is um because a lot of times people think i'll just throw up a website and that's a portfolio so portfolio is technically it's a collection of your work it's going to show what you can do it should ideally have a way for someone to get in touch with you so maybe an email phone number something like that it should also give a little description of who you are right so think kind of along the lines of a resume like it's gonna give who you are um i would say include as much good work as you can so don't don't just put something up there because you have something if it's bad don't put it up there and kind of going along with that focus on the work you actually want to do so if you're listening to this and you absolutely hate writing javascript and you like to design do not fill your portfolio with javascript because the people that come look at your portfolio are going to say they're really good at javascript and then you're going to get into a job you don't like doing or you won't get a job because your javascript's not that good that would be my case so again portfolios always seem kind of hard because you're bragging about yourself you're talking about yourself but you have to be able to do that you have to kind of talk yourself up you can't be like i'm dirt i don't know what i'm doing because people won't they'll believe you they'll be like okay they're not any good so you have to kind of brag on yourself a little bit um so now let's talk about what a portfolio is not a portfolio a portfolio is not a blog nobody cares about your pinterest recipes or anything like that that people put into blogs this is not a blog so maybe when you get a little bit further along it can be a blog but it's not a blog right now it's also not a collection of photos unless you're a photographer you don't need photos on your website it's not instagram or flickr or any of that stuff so you know keep it keep it kind of focused and next your opinion on absolutely anything nobody cares this is like a resume so i know this is kind of harsh but technology you know nothing about but you have opinions about don't do that no you will make yourself look stupid so don't do that don't talk about religion even if you're religious i'm religious but i keep that off of there because people that are like coming to look at my stuff they may not be and i might offend them so i'm going to keep that off of there politics don't put politics on there because if you're way over on the left you're hiring person may be way over on the right and vice versa so just keep it neutral and don't put any kind of isms on there i've seen this before a lot in the past no isms no racism no sexism no isms just keep it clean keep it simple um no dank memes please and no cat photos because nobody's got time for that see so so i put that in there because you know that's like ironic okay whatever all right so there's different kinds of portfolios you're going to see out there um photography portfolios typically have a lot of pictures and almost no text they're almost always a squarespace template with this grid of pictures and you know they'll be like one word and that'll be it um then there's the videography guys and their theirs are always like so busy and so moving you can't keep up with them and they call those show reels um so lots of youtube clips embedded in there there's written portfolios and those are really boring because it's just lots of text but if you're looking for a writer that's what you want there's design portfolios like mine so those are going to be printed or they're going to be online lots of pictures some text we usually use case studies to explain things like explain why we did what we did and then there's development and on a development we're going to want to see some code a lot of the good ones have code on them so uh remember that um so here's some good examples of portfolios and uh they're out of order because of the way i opened it but uh you know whatever see if we can uh look at that that's awesome let's go back to this okay so we'll start with his one jolie thanks kimberly kimberly sent me a couple of examples from the group and then i have a couple of my friends and then i have mine so we're just gonna scroll through these real quick um i'm gonna tell you why i think they're great um this one's great because he gives us a little example of who he is right he gives us some nice just kind of straightforward what he's done what he can do he has a link to his resume right here which is great because it's a pdf and that means that if i'm a hiring person i can click that link download it and send it to all the people that matter um he also has a picture of himself which is awesome if you have a good picture of yourself put it up there so that way we know what you look like next he has his projects and he's got app and code and i'm afraid that if i click one of these they're going to like mess up it's going to like you know nope all right great so it takes me to github and i can actually like look at his code so that's awesome okay great um so he's got those then he has a contact form so we have a way to get in touch with him uh and then at the bottom uh he has like social stuff so find me elsewhere he's got github and well does this like codepen nope free code cam and then linkedin linkedin is a great one if you're trying to get a job because all the professional people like to hang out on linkedin and uh they really like that for some reason all right we'll go to the next one how do i it's always great when it doesn't work the way i wanted all right this is my friend justin justin battenfield um he started off life as a freelance wordpress developer or something like that and he worked his way up and then he was the lead frontend developer at life church for three or four years and then he came and worked at max and now he is like vp of product or something at tbs factoring his portfolio is really anorexic you can get a hold of his resume up here his work his contact his work will just take you i'm pretty sure it takes you to dribble yep and you can just scroll through dribble and see everything he's done and i can't work chrome apparently um so he just gives you like a really quick little blurb about himself download his resume and then he has twitter linkedin dribble and email so next we're gonna talk about clint clint mcmanaman this is one of my heroes he's been in the design game since like 2002. um so right now his website is pretty much just this straightforward deal but if you click here it takes you to his portfolio proper and he uses case studies to kind of show a lot of the things that he's done which he's done a lot of things so i like his because it's just really clean it's really straightforward he gives you a headline that explains pretty much everything he's all about if you follow him on any social media that's what you're going to get so he's pretty straightforward and i like that so if you'll notice like things are really simple they're really kind of just straightforward and i know these guys are mostly designers and then we have a maya right all right is that is that embarrassing to like have yours like thrown up there all right now i really like this again you give a really quick just what you can do you're not like reaching out there and saying you can you know operate microsoft office or something which is i've seen that we have a great little gallery of projects um and then we have them over here on codepen which is awesome because this proves to me that you did this it's on codepen so i can go see what you've done it's awesome and then we have and i like this we have a resume download the resume but we also have the certificate so this gives validity to the claims that you're making that hey i have a certificate that proves that i can do what i say i'm doing then we have contact information so there's there's a few examples i'm going to go back over here now oh i guess we can look at mine i just went through mine and rebuilt it so i love the mountains so i have mountains i have a blurb about my professional self and my personal self i have a little section about what i do and i have three big projects that i've done i'm gonna write case studies for those later and then i have a little chat form so mine's kind of anorexic but there it is all right so if we come back here technology so great when it works all right so my thing that i would say is remember to focus on the job to be done rather than the style it's really easy when you're trying to represent yourself to like get hung up on how things look or whatever like remember that the people that are visiting your site have a job to be done and that is to learn about you and to contact you so remember that and make sure they can easily do that all right so let's talk about the building blocks to include to make your portfolio awesome everybody wants to do that right all right so include your work that's gonna be really important it's not a portfolio if you don't it's just like a little web page so give me work that you've completed right you want to make sure that it's done that you can show it off maybe try some work that challenged you maybe it was something that was really hard and maybe you can explain why that was hard and how you got over it maybe try some work in progress like if it's okay with your employer or if you're just doing things on the side you can put work in progress and you can explain where you're at and where you're going you want to do work that showcases your skill so like the skills that you're focusing on that's what you want to show like i'm not going to cram my portfolio full of code because code is secondary to design for me so i'm going to go design something and then i'll code it and i don't really care how the code looks well i care but that's a different talk so make sure you also do work that you want to do again if you i mean focus on what you're after right don't don't focus on things because i said to do it or because daniel said to do it and especially if carson says to do it no i'm kidding guys carson's great i just had to do i just had to give him a little dig um but yeah put work you want to do on there like if you're like i said if you want to focus on ui ux then go figure that out if you want to focus on development go figure that out if you want to do like machine learning go figure that out um you know focus on what you want to do be you right so try to put your best foot forward with your work you want quality over quantity um you know show them what you know what you're doing i would say quality over quantity because i don't want to scroll through a bunch of stuff that doesn't look very good that isn't complete that you don't really care about i'd rather see three things that you care about than 10 things you don't all right so show your work that's the next one consider using case studies so that is a like laying out and saying this was the problem this was our essentially our hypothesis this was how we approached it and this is the results that's really good because it shows the thought process behind it not just i copied code from here and pasted code to here and it worked i don't know why you want to show why explain the technology stack you used you know why why did you use react overview or why didn't you use wordpress when it was a cms or why did you use whatever you used explain why instead of just saying i use these technologies and putting the cute little icons like great you use those use those on every project why did you choose that explain problems you ran into so like if you're working on something and you had a problem and it was essentially a show stopper how did you get around that did you ask for help did you stay up till midnight trying to figure it out how did you solve that problem the reason i am stressing this one is because it demonstrates that you're a problem solver and not just a you know hanging out on stack overflow which is sort of problem solving in my case but it shows that you know what you're doing and you know how to go beyond just the specs you can actually get out there and kind of solve problems so think about soft skills demonstrating those like who did you have to talk to to get the specs like how did you figure out what the problem was that you had to to accomplish these are these are like soft skills that a hiring person is going to want to like hear about and i wouldn't say like list them out like a bullet point maybe it's how you describe the problem and like maybe the problem was you know we my company acquired this job and i was required to talk to these people and then i had to talk to this person to figure out what the users were after and therefore i chose this technology stack and we ran into this problem and this is how we solved it and that's all just in a short maybe couple paragraphs you know and then you have screenshots and maybe some code pin embeds showing the code and that's just an idea you might also think about explaining how you organize your work how do you organize your tasks you know like what kind of what kind of organizational system do you use that shows that you know how to organize your life and you're not living out of a suitcase there's nothing wrong with living out a suitcase if you do but employers don't want your code that way because it's really hard to come back to all right so think of your portfolio as a resume with some personality um i know a while back it was really cool to do like these little catchy res like portfolios that were full of trendy verbiage but people aren't really after that so do include your resume someplace to download like i said hiring people want to download that and they want to share it with the people in their group um the people that matter do include a link to something like linkedin that's a great place to send people for professional stuff they love it do give us a little about section so we can learn about you that's a great idea so that uh you know i know you're a real person and you know not just something thrown up there i would say keep it professional but add just a little bit of your personality i mean think about what kind of colors do you like what kind of pictures do you like what kind of how do you word things i mean don't you don't want to be a robot you want to have some fun with it like it's not it's not like a science experiment or something you want to have some fun um so give me a way to contact you and you would be surprised how many people forget this piece like if you're putting a portfolio up there and your goal is to get a job or get side gigs i need a way to get a hold of you and a lot of people sometimes forget that i know that sounds silly but make sure you have an email um i would say have a phone number but when i had a phone number on my website i got so many spam calls so you know if you want your phone number that's fine um social media is fine but use it with caution so i have a note about social media and this is coming from me observing other people keep your social media private so that it's your social network and not the world but if you do want to share with the world keep it neutral so maybe if you're going to put your twitter on there and you're a religious person don't put a ton of like opinionated religious stuff on there and if you're a political person don't put your political ideas out there i mean we talked about this a second ago and i'm stressing it for a reason don't put any illegal stuff you know if you're out smoking big doinks in amish we don't need to see that especially if you want a job put no isms again no racism no sexism none of that please don't even give your opinion on it because you can assume if you put it on the internet if somebody's looking to hire you they will find it and you can assume that if it's borderline offensive it will offend them just assume those things and also assume that if you put it on the internet it will never ever ever go away and it will come back to haunt you in 10 years just assume those things they may not be true but assume them because people are going to search for you they're going to google you they're going to do all sorts of stuff they're not just going to look at your website and go that was cool let's hire them they're going to they're going to dig into your past so that's what they do all right here's a few things to consider as we kind of wrap up and these are just my opinions so whatever consider who your end user is going to be and this is where i always start um who are you going to build this for is it for somebody who's going to be employing you either as a contractor or as a job are you building it for your peers kind of like the people in this room is it kind of just to show off what you can do are you just building it for yourself just to have something all three of those things are going to have different outcomes when you're done building it um so as you kind of identify who you're building it for think about where they're at right now like what kind of position are they in um you know if it's a if it's a hiring person they're going to be a kind of a they're probably going to be a business person they're going to be kind of coming across your site you know at work so you can think about that think about their background because that's going to give you a really big idea into what they're expecting so if they're if they're this gentleman on the right that likes haha business he's going to expect certain things whereas if it's me i'm going to expect something else from your site so if you think about who is going to be coming to your site and you're going to think about what their background is you'll know kind of how to you know tailor your website to get the result that you want all right so again kind of diving more into that what is your end user looking for um what kind of position are you going for are you going to be a developer a leader or are you just a haha business person and those people seriously exist they run meetings and they they go to meetings and they talk about meetings and they talk about getting stuff done and they have meetings about getting stuff done and they never actually do anything but they love it so what kind of position are you going for um and you'll kind of want to tailor your site for that um again think about what what's their job to be done when they're coming to your website what are they looking for are they looking for your work or are they looking for you know what are they looking for typically they want to know about you and they want to see your work and then they want to be able to contact you if they want to and you're looking at maybe 30 seconds before they make that decision if you're lucky so why would these people be visiting your site is it because you applied for a job is it because they just saw you in a forum somewhere is it because you you know like taped it to their door i don't know i wouldn't do that these qr codes are they're not cool anymore all right how did they find you did did somebody pass them your website was it like you know like in a chat that they copy and paste it check this out did they find you like through a user group type thing i mean these are all going to kind of dictate you know how they approach your site so i would say have empathy for your end user and make it really easy for them to find what they're looking for because you're helping them like you if you do that remember that they have a job to do and they want to do it quickly nobody wants to hunt for things even if you think it's clever they don't so make it easy for them to find what they're looking for all right and finally just remember your portfolio doesn't have to be perfect um i've struggled with this a lot in my life and a lot of people i've talked to especially when i remember when we were in college it had to be perfect it doesn't have to be perfect build it to your current skill level if you're trying to be a developer and you can only write html and css that's fine you can build a portfolio just build it make sure it gets out there keep it simple you don't need a ton of like fancy animations or fancy effects or whatever just keep it simple remember what you're trying to accomplish with it and make it easy to use but have fun doing it that's the other thing like if you want to put some some fancier things in there to kind of show your skills and have fun doing it that's fine too just don't feel like you have to um number one thing is get it done um because like a resume this is kind of like the you know the electronic resume essentially like you're putting yourself out there and saying here i am this is what i can do um so if you feel struck at all i put this quote up here that's what's been really big for me lately um it's by marcus aurelius the roman emperor he says the impediment to action advances action what stands in the way becomes the way so building a portfolio is hard because you have to brag about yourself you have to handle writing all the body copy for the website you have to think about doing this and that and it has to be professional but it makes you a better developer and a better professional for doing it bye right all right does anybody have any questions and anybody yes right okay she's asking um for me to repeat talking about case studies specifically like what goes into case studies um case studies typically highlight a project you're working on so let's say you were building a project and you had to make a form for the first time right so you were you were responsible for building a form that took in a certain amount of information and sent it somewhere so you wouldn't highlight the whole project you might say within this project that i was working on at work and you might give a little bit of background about the project you would say my task was to build this form and so you would say i started by researching the forms and we we came to figure out this was what information was needed you know maybe it was the person's name an email and a short message i mean this is really simple um and so you talked about how you had a certain technology you were using and you had to go figure out how to pull those things in when the form was submitted and you had to talk about how you captured that that stuff in the database and like alerted whoever needed to be alerted and so along the way you can talk about then you can put in code snippets you can put in screenshots you could put in screen captures like video and then you can kind of elaborate into the results so like maybe the results were because of this people were able to ask for help which increased productivity x percent that's typically kind of what you see on most case studies and i'm coming from a design background a little bit so it is kind of like problem solution result is kind of what you can boil that down to um was did that help to answer your question great anybody else no oh go ahead no you're fine it's daniel go ahead type of job um work you want to do on your landing page your portfolio is passed down the more in depth but i also heard that you should have like additional work to show if you're asked is that something you've heard before and like would you suggest to have like more depth work on the side so she's asking about like and you can correct me if i'm wrong you're asking about keywords and extra work is that okay so she's kind of asking about like keywords and and having more than just what what's on your portfolio so keywords i don't really know about that's kind of like black magic to me that gets into like seo territory which is not something i'm very familiar with um but as far as having extra work yes you will want extra work for an interview i would say on your portfolio online maybe putting your best foot forward but then having somewhere maybe github maybe codepen if you're into design maybe dribble or behance some place where you can stash other work and it's not that that works bad it's just that you haven't chosen to highlight it as a quote case study um because case studies take a lot of work like you really have to kind of dig in and think about why you did what you did and you have to go track down the results and stuff like that so they actually take a lot of work so maybe it's not that that works bad and as much as it's just you didn't want to do that you know what i'm saying so yes when you get into an interview people are going to want to be able to see the different skills that you have and they're going to want to see different types of work that you've done and they're going to see that you're flexible and they're going to want to see that you can problem solve and so by having more work to pull out and show that might not be on your website you show just that so did that answer your questions um that's a really good question and that's a really hard question i would say at least in my case what i've done is i've either asked the client and said is it cool if i show this you know on my portfolio and you you know you can if you can demonstrate to them a lot of times that you're not going to give away any trade secrets or anything like that they will a lot of times say yes if you ask them if not the other thing i've had to do in the past is to essentially recreate the project by changing enough stuff that i can so that it's basically not that project because really what you're what you're trying to say is here's a problem and here's how i solved it and so if it's a fake company and fake data you you're still solving that problem and i mean you can probably in an interview you can explain your situation and they're gonna be they're going to be cool with it you kind of have to be creative in how you solve that problem because that's a problem in and of itself anybody else uh where's the happy medium the happy medium is if you can look at the website and say it communicates what you want it to communicate so if you need a header and a picture and one paragraph tag you're done you did it um you know maybe you can get in with a few extra stuff but the i've heard this over and over and over again and i always kind of struggle with it because nobody wants to follow it but the rule is this nobody reads anything on the internet i mean think about it when was the last time you read you seriously read anything on the internet i mean and i'm not talking about like you you saw an interesting article you chose to read i'm talking about as you browse the internet somebody sends you a link what's the first thing you do you scroll you look at headers you look at pictures and if it's interesting you might read the first sentence of a paragraph so that's how people typically consume websites and you have to remember that like if someone sends my portfolio to a hiring person they're not going to read it until they think i'm interesting they're going to scroll through there they're going to find my work and they're going to go look at my work and they're going to go ah this is not what we want or oh that's so perfect that's what we want and then they'll go back and read it and if they decide they don't like me they probably just couldn't close the tab and that was it so the happy medium is saying i want to communicate this message and this is what it takes to do it and when it comes to writing i've always heard you want to keep it about a sixth grade level and you want to write out your message and then rewrite it and then rewrite it and then rewrite it and then rewrite it and make it as simple as possible um you know and then basically whatever you have cut it in half and rewrite it again because that's how writing goes and that's why i'm not a writer because it's kind of hard but um there's tools for that but does that answer your question or awesome anybody else oh from twitch how would i show a portfolio in a portfolio project i'm working on with someone else is that oh i didn't do the entire thing okay i would highlight the pieces that i did do and i would not be shy to say i worked with another person or you know maybe even name them if they're cool with it and i would basically say i worked on this piece and then so and so worked on this piece and then i took it back and worked on this piece and you know you that's actually really good because it shows that you can work in a team environment and that you can communicate you know back and forth and password back and forth like say uh so so you're asking about what do you do with like skill sets so like if you have a bunch of different skills how do you demonstrate that okay i would say like in a development environment it's probably okay to list out i know these languages um because that's really one of the best ways to show that um but if you can back that up with some projects and be like in this project i use c sharp and in this project i use javascript and this u in this project i use php and if you can like demonstrate that that's even better because then it's not just a list of things that you quote know it's actually demonstrating that you know how to do that i typically don't list out skill sets because in the design world it's kind of become a it doesn't matter it's like oh you can write some code and you can do wireframes and you can do mockups so that's it and my portfolio already demonstrates that so it's like i don't have to do that so that was a great question yeah i would actually probably list those out somewhere it's a it's a static web page i use dribble to host my work and then i link out to that i use jekyll and it works with github pages so it's like free hosting so you make a gh pages branch and you push your code up there and then it point the you buy a domain name and you point it to that dns and it works so so yeah it's static um i don't i don't do much in that way you were gonna ask a question so you're totally asking let me see you're asking if i use behance as a and dribble as a supplement or as my portfolio right yeah okay i actually use that as my portfolio both of them now have a feature where you they like make you a little web page and so i built the web page that i showed you guys let me i'll pull it back up actually if i can figure out how to work google chrome because apparently i don't know how to work google chrome there we go okay so i built this page and then all of these things link to dribble and so i've created dribble projects and then in the descriptions i talk about what i'm doing there and why i'm doing things and then you have all the different things and then when i say see more work that just links to my all my dribble feed so there's a lot of things in here that are not too bad but i didn't put them in there as a case study just because it didn't really matter to me so that's how i'm using that and that going back to your question that means because i'm using an outside source i don't have to use a database and i can just use a static page to just host some information so yes all right sorry you want to see the project right i'm actually i don't know i want to make case studies i haven't done it because they're timeconsuming um so i've put these you know i have basically my last three major employments and i have examples from there from things i'm doing so this is stuff i'm currently working on um and it and inside of this stuff here it kind of explains like each post i'm explaining what the post is about and like what what kind of problems it's solving um so it's sort of a case study but it's not like a traditional case study i think if you were to read through that you would actually kind of get a grasp for what i'm talking about like what's what what the what the the picture actually means so i should probably do a better job of actually making a page for a case study but i was lazy and i have a lot going on so i just linked to that so remember that i'm a designer so everything is about the end picture and showing you how i got to that whereas if you're writing code it's about how you built that thing so there is there is kind of a difference there any other questions no no that's a good question um i tried to get stewarthines.com and a realtor in amarillo texas had it and i was really upset and so i got stuart heinz not me and that's how i chose my domain name sorry i don't have any dnd references daniel back there all right is there any other questions nope i'm sorry you're asking what i used for my contact form it's called formly and it's form ly or something i i don't know i just typed in a contact form for static website and there was like two or three and i picked formally because it was open source and free um so i don't know how well it works it works when i submit one myself so i guess we'll see i guess everybody can go spam it right now and send me emails and we'll see how that works that'd be kind of fun any other questions oh so you're asking about like uh when i said don't give your opinion on technologies all right i'll explain that a little bit further yo go ahead sorry um right the only reason i say don't push your opinion on things is because your opinion is a lot of times what i've learned your opinion and so while your opinion may be right most of the time it might not be right all the time and you may offend someone wanting to hire you or work with you just by your opinion and you may never even know it because they were reading your blog and they were like oh he's so opinionated about this one thing that i just can't get over i mean it's silly but it's trying to take that path of like least resistance because as soon as you try to say that you know about something people are going to come out of the woodwork to tell you you don't you know and it's so it's just like when i i always look at a portfolio like a resume kind of so it's like i'm trying to be as neutral as possible but if you know a lot about something and you can prove you know a lot about something then go ahead i would say by linking to something like having a medium account that's kind of become the new like blog platform and like just linking to that on off your site would be fine if you like to write about tech but i've seen a lot of people and myself included when i was younger just giving my opinion about stuff and then when you look at it five years later you're like man i was dumb or you read somebody and you're like yeah you're a total noob you don't know what you're talking about you know like so it's like you want to just be really careful when you put your opinion out there that's all that's all i mean by that it might have seemed a little strong but yeah i yeah i think both of you right on that she was saying you know that a company may see that you were writing about something and decided you were totally stuck on that one thing and he was saying if you write in a neutral way then it'd be okay and i think you're both right on that like you know just i don't know just be careful when you're posting your opinion is i guess i guess the sum of that all right anybody else got anything oh all right so uh good luck making your portfolios and uh we'll see you next time does somebody have announcements announcements okay yay
