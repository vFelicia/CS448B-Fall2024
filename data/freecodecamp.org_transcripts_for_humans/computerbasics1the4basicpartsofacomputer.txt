about the basics of computer hardware.
00:05 - Computers are made up 
of four basic parts:
00:07 - The Input/Output, CPU, 
and Memory.
00:11 - The Input is what you're 
putting into the computer.
00:14 - Think about mouse, keyboard, 
microphone,
00:18 - any way you're getting 
data into the computer.
00:20 - The Output is what you're 
watching on your monitor
00:23 - or listening to on 
your speakers.
00:25 - These can both be any format 
like text, numbers,
00:29 - videos, images, what-have-you. 
It doesn't matter.
00:32 - The CPU stands for 
Central Processing Unit
00:35 - and that's what we all think of 
when we think of a computer.
00:38 - It's what does the functions.
00:39 - It's what runs the software.
00:41 - It manipulates the data.
00:43 - The Memory is where we 
store data and information.
00:46 - Now the CPU has exclusive 
access to this memory.
00:49 - You can't get to the Memory 
from the Input
00:51 - or from the Output 
without the use of the CPU.
00:54 - So just to review we've got 
four basic parts of a computer:
00:58 - the Input/Output, 
CPU, and Memory.

Hi, I'm Briana from freeCodeCamp and today we're going to talk about the basics of computer hardware. Computers are made up of four basic parts The Input/Output, CPU, and Memory. The Input is what you're putting into the computer. Think about mouse, keyboard, microphone, any way you're getting data into the computer. The Output is what you're watching on your monitor or listening to on your speakers. These can both be any format like text, numbers, videos, images, whathaveyou. It doesn't matter. The CPU stands for Central Processing Unit and that's what we all think of when we think of a computer. It's what does the functions. It's what runs the software. It manipulates the data. The Memory is where we store data and information. Now the CPU has exclusive access to this memory. You can't get to the Memory from the Input or from the Output without the use of the CPU. So just to review we've got four basic parts of a computer the Input/Output, CPU, and Memory.
