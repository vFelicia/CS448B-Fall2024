00:00 - everybody we're going to get started
00:01 - momentarily
00:04 - and
00:06 - you could say hi in the chat
00:08 - which i have on the screen here
00:12 - i'll be the first to say hi
00:16 - okay i guess i wasn't
00:18 - hello
00:21 - ali
00:24 - and like i mentioned in case you're just
00:25 - filtering in we're gonna get started
00:27 - here in a minute or two hello quincy
00:31 - founder of free code camp
00:36 - emery hello
00:41 - muhammad
00:42 - sudeep i i'm just
00:44 - i'm terrible at these names
00:48 - all right here they come
00:55 - craig mullins with a verified check mark
00:59 - hello everybody
01:06 - hello hello hello all right
01:09 - so while everybody's getting filtered in
01:11 - um i will go ahead and start the
01:13 - introduction first i'm gary simon i've
01:15 - been a ui ux designer and front-end
01:17 - developer for the last 20-plus years
01:20 - i've been an instructor in teaching
01:22 - for the last 10 years and
01:25 - this is the third of the three streams
01:28 - that we've had scheduled uh for myself
01:31 - to stream a live ui ux review show here
01:35 - at free code camp on the youtube channel
01:37 - so perhaps we'll do this again sometime
01:38 - in the future but basically what we're
01:40 - doing is you are submitting your ui
01:43 - designs
01:44 - and i'm reviewing them live here all
01:47 - right so i already have a few picked out
01:49 - but you do that
01:50 - on twitter and you just use the hashtag
01:53 - live ui ux review and i may get you to
01:57 - yours i may not but still there's value
02:00 - even if i don't get to yours because a
02:02 - lot of people make the same mistakes and
02:04 - we can all learn from from each other of
02:06 - course
02:07 - um and so this is uh just a real quick
02:09 - plug uh designcourse.com i'm going to be
02:12 - we're actively working on this and it's
02:14 - going to be the most comprehensive
02:17 - that's my goal at least the most
02:18 - comprehensive
02:20 - service for learning ui ux design um so
02:23 - that's coming in several months time if
02:24 - you want to be notified when that's i
02:26 - released go ahead and enter your email
02:28 - here at designcourse.com and then
02:30 - secondly my youtube channel i right here
02:34 - it's design course it's linked here in
02:36 - the youtube description of this video um
02:38 - so yeah let's go ahead and get started
02:42 - so here's one that i
02:43 - chose
02:45 - this is a levi landing page with gsap
02:49 - all right so if you people don't know
02:51 - what gsap is gsap is an acronym for the
02:54 - green sock animation platform it allows
02:57 - you to do
02:58 - uh more complex
03:00 - animations
03:02 - rather than just using something like
03:03 - straight up css animations um so notice
03:06 - how everything comes in sequentially
03:08 - gsap makes this very easy to do in the
03:11 - front end development process it's
03:13 - javascript library it's very powerful i
03:15 - have several courses on it on my own
03:17 - youtube channel so you can definitely
03:18 - check that out to learn how to do this
03:20 - sort of thing so this is a
03:23 - a nice design overall a there's nothing
03:25 - i can't scroll a lot of this doesn't
03:27 - work so kind of what you see is what you
03:29 - get here um and in terms of the ui
03:32 - design itself
03:34 - i really like it um
03:36 - it's it's unique it's interesting um i
03:39 - don't think see anything that really is
03:41 - coming out as being
03:42 - uh negative with this one um it's using
03:46 - some modern ui design techniques like uh
03:49 - having kind of like this vertical
03:51 - bar over here
03:53 - um the whole circular navigation up here
03:57 - assuming this were ever to be finished
03:59 - so yeah i i like it
04:02 - i can't really say anything negative for
04:03 - what it is
04:04 - so also as a part of these live streams
04:07 - i do um i ask
04:09 - everybody watching here in the youtube
04:11 - chat to give it a rating
04:13 - one being the worst and 10 being the
04:15 - best you have about 15 seconds and then
04:16 - we'll see if i agree with you or not
04:19 - so go ahead and do that
04:21 - one being the worst 10 being the best
04:23 - consider the ui design any ux potential
04:26 - issues you see and factor that into your
04:28 - result
04:37 - somebody's already given it a 10 no he
04:39 - said eight
04:42 - well let's see if this is responsive
04:43 - first of all we could check that out
04:46 - no not quite
04:47 - just kind of made it for desktop
04:59 - should always learn css first and then
05:02 - try to use gsap for your animation
05:03 - purposes
05:05 - okay i'm going to go ahead i'm going to
05:07 - give this one for what it is
05:10 - a straight up
05:16 - 8.1
05:19 - yeah there we go
05:21 - all right i think it's pretty solid okay
05:25 - next one i have picked out
05:30 - all right so sort of a cool
05:32 - loading animation we saw here let's
05:34 - refresh that
05:37 - very cool
05:38 - um
05:39 - the thing that i notice right off the
05:41 - bat that is an issue is the lack of
05:44 - white space or the too much white space
05:46 - here so this isn't necessarily a white
05:48 - space issue it's an alignment issue this
05:51 - block right here which is comprised of
05:53 - this headline this sub headline and this
05:56 - call to action should all be pushed down
05:59 - considerably so
06:00 - when i say that we're going to give this
06:02 - like a margin top
06:04 - of
06:07 - i don't know
06:08 - 5 m units there we go so now we have
06:10 - almost an equal amount of white space
06:13 - from the top and bottom and now it looks
06:15 - in
06:16 - it's it's quite a bit better i would
06:18 - also probably make this right here
06:21 - a little bit less width um maybe put in
06:24 - on the next line right here that way it
06:26 - gives it a little bit more white space
06:28 - between this element and this element i
06:30 - really like the
06:32 - uh illustration here it being animated
06:35 - like this
06:36 - uh so this makes sense has like you
06:38 - little skeleton ui windows so it's
06:40 - always
06:41 - a good idea to use illustrations that
06:43 - are relevant based on the purpose of the
06:44 - landing page and the surface itself um
06:50 - let's okay up here we have
06:52 - a light and dark mode
06:54 - i kind of don't like this one because
06:55 - you're not sure which one is cho is
06:58 - really chosen yeah this is light version
07:00 - obviously but it should be a little bit
07:02 - more obvious like this should be filled
07:03 - in here perhaps already by default
07:05 - and sometimes to me
07:08 - i wasn't even sure what this was
07:10 - at a glance i thought it was like a
07:11 - chocolate chip cookie
07:13 - but just the moon
07:14 - but look checking this out anyhow
07:17 - this is pretty good um just for
07:20 - how everything reacts
07:22 - when you're switching from light to dark
07:26 - all right coming down one thing i do
07:29 - want to say is this this section right
07:31 - here this container because it's a very
07:33 - very subtle difference
07:35 - from this white to this very light
07:38 - desaturated sort of blue
07:40 - i think it's not enough contrast i think
07:42 - we needed to just maybe
07:44 - a little bit make that a tad bit darker
07:46 - so
07:47 - you can see it's almost white up here in
07:49 - the color picker so if we come down just
07:51 - a little bit
07:52 - i think that's better
07:54 - so now we can clearly see the separation
07:56 - of these two
07:58 - you know this this section up here which
08:00 - is traditionally called the hero section
08:02 - and then this section right here so i
08:04 - would say the same thing about this
08:06 - section over here same color you'd want
08:08 - to change it to up here so you have a
08:10 - more of a distinction between these
08:11 - containers so if i refresh it you'll see
08:13 - the original
08:15 - and it just kind of makes it a little
08:16 - bit harder to see the card
08:18 - and
08:19 - this section being separated itself this
08:22 - i really like this section right here um
08:24 - everything is
08:25 - is i aligned correctly there's a good
08:29 - white space the topography is good
08:31 - there's a good visual hierarchy which is
08:33 - reinforced by the fact that you know
08:34 - your different pieces of
08:36 - type
08:37 - are
08:38 - um
08:39 - changed and
08:41 - they're separated with each other to
08:42 - create that hierarchy through
08:45 - uh the font weight
08:46 - through the font size and
08:49 - contrast between these elements so those
08:52 - three things will really give you good
08:53 - topography if you understand how to
08:55 - apply them so and this is all pretty
08:57 - solid i like the icons they're simple
09:02 - this here again
09:04 - you could probably on it on a large
09:07 - viewport like this
09:08 - put in three or four
09:11 - of these um
09:13 - in a
09:14 - different columns so three instead of
09:16 - just having two because that really
09:17 - makes them really large i'd probably put
09:19 - at least three
09:21 - when you're out here in the larger
09:24 - viewports
09:26 - but other than that this is all solid i
09:29 - like the the type inside
09:31 - we're using labels on your forum that's
09:34 - excellent
09:35 - you should always have a contact form on
09:37 - your site don't just put your email
09:38 - address like a mail to link or something
09:41 - i always have a form
09:43 - that people can contact you with but i
09:45 - would also say always give them a way to
09:47 - email that you if they wish instead of
09:49 - using your form so offer both
09:51 - you want to give them as many ways to
09:53 - contact you as possible this is solid
09:55 - though so i what do you think this
09:57 - person should get for a rating for their
10:00 - portfolio one being the worst 10 the
10:02 - best i think the biggest issue was just
10:03 - this area right here too much white
10:05 - space get that centered here vertically
10:14 - oh we got a
10:18 - chat thank you for that
10:20 - which goes to free code camp
10:31 - one being the worst 10 mean the best get
10:33 - your
10:37 - answers in
10:46 - is another high higher rated entry
10:49 - for sure
10:50 - so for me
10:52 - i'm going to go ahead and give this one
11:00 - and
11:02 - 8.3
11:04 - or so
11:05 - i i notice so there's a lot of eights
11:07 - there's a lot of nines there's some
11:08 - sevens
11:11 - so yeah pretty pretty solid
11:15 - quincy says seven he wasn't as impressed
11:17 - okay
11:19 - all right
11:20 - next up is going to be an adobe xd
11:23 - prototype
11:28 - all right so what we have here
11:30 - is digital marketing agency um
11:34 - there's several areas that we can click
11:36 - one thing just about the topography i
11:38 - like the colors um
11:40 - this seems to be a good font size this
11:42 - is the mont cigarette type of uh font
11:45 - family which
11:46 - i know because i use forever and i still
11:48 - use um i think a little bit more line
11:51 - height it's a little bit scrunched up in
11:52 - my opinion um
11:54 - so i would increase the line height just
11:56 - a bit
11:56 - um
11:57 - outside of that
11:59 - pretty solid uh call to action here
12:03 - so adobe xd has the ability to animate
12:05 - on hover
12:06 - um
12:09 - i'm not sure if i would increase the
12:11 - size of these honestly on hover
12:14 - but uh nonetheless your alignment's good
12:16 - you notice you're in the the very first
12:18 - link the home nav
12:19 - uh defines a column here and then right
12:23 - along this column is the rest of this
12:25 - content and that that creates a nice
12:27 - uniform consistent layout it just makes
12:29 - it look better um
12:31 - one thing i don't like is that me our
12:33 - team button
12:35 - the the gray the mid gray right here
12:36 - it's very hard to to use mid gray
12:38 - effectively in the ui design um in this
12:41 - button here being blue
12:43 - it doesn't contrast very well so i would
12:45 - change this color to
12:48 - to something else you could either go
12:50 - light
12:50 - i probably wouldn't make it this blue
12:52 - color because then it competes
12:54 - uh for your your primary call to action
12:58 - so i would use maybe a really dark maybe
13:00 - very you know almost as dark as this for
13:03 - the background here
13:05 - next up looking at this area this area
13:08 - it's designed well like the cards it has
13:10 - good white space inside
13:13 - however
13:14 - it's a little bit confusing um because
13:17 - you've chosen to emphasize a few over
13:19 - the others and i'm not sure if that's
13:22 - necessarily what you wanted to do um so
13:25 - sometimes also i don't know what these
13:27 - little dots are for it almost makes me
13:29 - think like there might be some sort of
13:30 - weird inner navigation within this this
13:33 - card so it's kind of confusing
13:35 - um but i would probably opt just to
13:37 - style them all the same unless there's
13:39 - some type of reason that you want to
13:40 - emphasize one or the other over the
13:42 - other
13:44 - next up this is this
13:46 - right here is pretty solid
13:52 - and this is kind of quite bordery or
13:55 - lining if you will
13:56 - you could probably either drop
13:59 - the uh
14:01 - significantly on the border you know
14:03 - making it just a very dark gray or you
14:05 - could get rid of the border entirely and
14:07 - make the background of this card i just
14:11 - a little like a shade lighter than the
14:13 - background um that way it won't feel
14:15 - like so many lines it's fine here
14:18 - because you really want to emphasize
14:19 - this middle one but
14:21 - it becomes a little bit cluttered in my
14:22 - opinion with the extra borders
14:24 - and always make sure you're using labels
14:26 - so if you're these look like they would
14:28 - be placeholder values and you don't want
14:30 - to rely on those make sure they're
14:31 - floating
14:33 - good call to action here
14:35 - and yeah again same comments about this
14:37 - this mid gray all right what do you
14:39 - think this person should get rated one
14:41 - being the worst and 10 being the best
14:43 - you have about 15 seconds to get your
14:44 - answers in
14:49 - the font family
14:51 - for that one was monsterat
14:54 - which you can download that that's
14:55 - available for you
14:56 - google fonts
15:16 - i've been hitting the gym hard so i'm
15:18 - like i need to stretch i'm like
15:20 - very sore right now
15:22 - oh we got a lot of ratings that came in
15:24 - all the way
15:26 - all right so for me um based on what i
15:29 - see here
15:30 - it's it's overall this part's a little
15:32 - bit cluttered and misaligned um but
15:35 - overall it's pretty decent there's no
15:36 - significant issues here
15:38 - so i'm going to rate this
15:43 - uh like a 6.9 maybe even a 7 or so
15:48 - i think that's pretty fair based on
15:50 - what i've
15:52 - rated the other ones
15:54 - all right so let's do yet another one
16:00 - so we've been looking at some pretty
16:01 - decent uh entries up to this point so
16:04 - far
16:05 - um this one needs some work though a
16:07 - little bit more than the other ones
16:09 - so
16:10 - why do i say that well
16:12 - first of all the first issue that i
16:14 - notice here is
16:16 - alignment
16:18 - all right so
16:19 - we have this logo right here in the logo
16:22 - by the way there's too much type in that
16:24 - logo i'm not sure whoever created this
16:26 - if you have control over the logo which
16:29 - you might not because you're a ui or
16:32 - designer or you're a friend of developer
16:33 - whatever
16:34 - um there's just i would have it
16:35 - refactored there's just too much type
16:37 - occurring here outside of that though it
16:40 - creates a a a column here
16:43 - and it
16:44 - in in also in and of itself if we're
16:46 - just going to take a look at the nav bar
16:48 - which is which is the logo plus
16:50 - this
16:51 - navigation right here navigation is
16:53 - completely fluid all the way to the
16:55 - right of the browser and then this is
16:57 - just kind of pushed over like
17:00 - randomly if it's going to be really
17:01 - fluid then this should be pushed over
17:03 - all the way over here as well to create
17:05 - that nice symmetry
17:06 - um but
17:08 - one thing so we have that issue but then
17:10 - the next issue is you have this
17:13 - column defined by
17:15 - all the type right here so it's thrown
17:18 - off in a couple of different ways the
17:20 - best way to deal with this is to take
17:22 - this logo put it right here
17:25 - and then also take this navigation and
17:27 - put it
17:28 - the contact us should probably end right
17:31 - here and so it would go like this length
17:34 - and then if you're kind of worried about
17:36 - the navigation being a little bit too
17:38 - close at that point to the logo because
17:39 - it'll be moved here and this will be
17:41 - moved in the middle um you could expand
17:43 - the width of this this fixed container
17:46 - that's centered here at this resolution
17:48 - or this this eye
17:50 - viewport
17:52 - all right after that
17:55 - there's not a ton of contrast with this
17:58 - red
17:59 - and this background you can read it but
18:01 - when you get to this
18:03 - this area is pretty fine because it's
18:04 - dark but when you get over here to this
18:06 - table or whatever it is it it there's
18:08 - not you could have more contrast this
18:10 - could even possibly be white
18:13 - the way to fix that is multiple ways
18:15 - changing the color of the type on top
18:16 - like making it completely white or
18:19 - further
18:20 - taking this photograph and making it
18:23 - darker
18:24 - there's an issue also with your call to
18:26 - actions so we have three different
18:29 - buttons in this area
18:31 - call us send us a message in free
18:33 - estimate that are all
18:35 - designed in the same exact manner
18:38 - so that's a lack of visual hierarchy
18:41 - the free estimate button is probably
18:43 - going to be the one that's most
18:44 - important and the one that you want
18:46 - people to to click on so every every
18:48 - page should have a goal of some sort and
18:51 - this one clearly it would probably be to
18:54 - free us to get a free estimate also a
18:56 - free estimate i'm not sure
18:58 - what that entails verse call us
19:01 - i guess this is just the phone number
19:03 - and then to send us a message so
19:05 - if you want to have these buttons here
19:08 - make style them differently it's so that
19:10 - they don't catch as much attention from
19:12 - the eye that this one does this one
19:14 - should this is what you want people to
19:16 - use so style these differently
19:19 - i wouldn't use red as a background for
19:20 - these
19:21 - there's a lot of different ways you can
19:23 - do it to have secondary call to actions
19:25 - and also this kind of seems just
19:26 - misplaced i would place these maybe
19:28 - underneath the free estimate or to the
19:30 - right of the free estimate button
19:33 - outside of that
19:34 - this part's pretty decent right here
19:37 - in the middle
19:43 - there's nothing really a hundred percent
19:45 - wrong uh happening at
19:47 - basically
19:48 - for the most part everywhere else
19:50 - whenever you have two columns like this
19:52 - here's the left column and here's the
19:53 - right column i prefer to not center
19:56 - text that's in the right or left maybe
19:58 - just left align these elements and that
20:00 - way you really define this this this uh
20:04 - column right here outside of that that
20:07 - is it
20:09 - and it's uh there's just a few small
20:11 - things that could improve it what do you
20:12 - think this person should get for a
20:13 - rating one being the worst and 10 being
20:15 - the very best
20:24 - quincy asked i've heard the right number
20:27 - of call to actions is always one are
20:29 - there exceptions to that i think it
20:31 - depends on what
20:33 - you may define as a call to action so um
20:37 - if there should always be at least a
20:39 - primary call to action and if we're
20:41 - talking primary then by nature we're
20:43 - talking one so yes you'd be correct um
20:46 - in this case
20:47 - uh we we have a lot of secondary sort of
20:50 - call to actions if you will or
20:52 - you know areas that people could
20:54 - actually leave um and in that case they
20:56 - should be
20:58 - not styled as prominently as that
20:59 - primary one if that makes sense so for
21:01 - this one i'm going to go ahead and give
21:03 - this i mean there's not a lot of like
21:05 - horrible things happening here so for me
21:08 - i'm going to give this one like a
21:11 - a 6.2
21:13 - or so
21:20 - once he's uh says 5.5 i think he's just
21:23 - a little bit
21:25 - we're pretty much consistent in in our
21:27 - ratings though a little bit lower than
21:29 - what i'm writing
21:30 - all right i
21:36 - oh
21:38 - there we go
21:40 - 47roofconstruction.com
21:44 - all right so this this layout to me
21:47 - it feels dated it's uh it's like back in
21:49 - 2013 2014 2015 these are the type of
21:52 - like layouts that i saw often um it has
21:56 - the logo here and has like these little
21:59 - areas where
22:00 - you can have you know the
22:02 - access to to call the people there's
22:04 - also the address
22:06 - um we have a very standard
22:09 - um hero section with the centered
22:12 - area here and my dog is barking down
22:14 - there
22:15 - um
22:17 - having said that
22:20 - i guess you could you can maybe take
22:23 - a little bit of a point away
22:25 - just because it's dated however the
22:27 - things that we need to be
22:29 - most certain of is that
22:31 - the
22:32 - ui in the ux is working well so
22:35 - in that case
22:36 - i can't really say there's anything too
22:38 - wrong
22:39 - sorry my voice is cracking up
22:42 - about what i see here
22:45 - request a complimentary inspection today
22:48 - that's a good headline
22:50 - get in touch i would probably bold up
22:52 - the white because this green versus this
22:55 - white text you lose a little bit of
22:56 - contrast there so
22:58 - i might use it maybe a slightly darker
23:01 - green or
23:02 - bold up and make it a little bit larger
23:04 - this getting touch button
23:06 - where does a get in touch button do um
23:08 - is there a contact page
23:12 - unfortunately it's kind of a slow
23:13 - loading right now
23:16 - and it's not secure maybe this isn't
23:18 - live yet i'm not sure
23:20 - one of one of here's a tip if you ever
23:23 - want to increase your leads
23:24 - and this would be considered a lead if
23:26 - somebody contacts you using this contact
23:28 - form
23:29 - i would and you only have a few or a
23:32 - small amount of fields that you're
23:34 - requesting there's one of two things you
23:37 - could do you could just take this
23:38 - feel free to contact us page
23:41 - and you could put this in a right column
23:43 - and then left align this in the left
23:45 - column that way it's one less click
23:48 - that people have to to to to to do in
23:50 - order to get in touch with you
23:52 - uh especially if you have a server that
23:55 - this is being hosted on that's kind of
23:56 - slow because that took too much too long
23:58 - way too long to get to that page
24:00 - so you're gonna reduce your your bounce
24:03 - rate you're going to increase your
24:04 - amount of leads
24:06 - and the other way to approach it is
24:07 - maybe just if you have more fields than
24:09 - you're comfortable with putting you know
24:11 - in your hero section of the landing page
24:13 - then maybe just put one or two and then
24:15 - it will just take them to the next one
24:17 - because they're already invested i
24:19 - in filling out all the the information
24:22 - outside of that about us
24:25 - maybe a little bit more white space here
24:28 - we are insurance experts contact us yeah
24:32 - i mean this is all it's all pretty solid
24:34 - here i don't see anything that's that's
24:35 - coming out and just
24:37 - being completely wrong with exception to
24:39 - this area because they're only
24:40 - placeholder values we want to make this
24:42 - accessible so make sure you use the
24:44 - labels as always all right so
24:47 - one being the worst ten being the best
24:48 - what do you think this person should get
24:50 - for a rating
25:07 - some people are saying five five three
25:15 - i'm going to go ahead and say
25:19 - let's see let's see if at least
25:21 - if it's working responsibly and it is
25:31 - yeah so for me
25:33 - oh we agree this time
25:38 - i'm going to say
25:40 - maybe around 6.5 to like a 6.8
25:44 - or maybe even close to a seven now that
25:46 - i think about it
25:49 - yeah so pretty solid here
25:51 - all right
25:52 - um
25:54 - next up
25:56 - this is like an english learning app of
25:58 - some sort
26:00 - um it's a yeah english leading course
26:02 - center all right
26:04 - um
26:06 - by the way like if it's a template
26:08 - there's no way for me to know if it's a
26:10 - template or not um so i always just make
26:12 - the assumption that it's not a template
26:15 - um so okay
26:17 - first thing i think is a little strange
26:18 - is this this little settings cog like
26:20 - what does that do
26:22 - theme color
26:24 - oh interesting okay so they let you
26:26 - choose the theme here
26:29 - which on a landing page i'm not too
26:30 - certain makes that much sense to be
26:32 - honest with you
26:34 - um
26:35 - random background right bullet i mean
26:38 - it's cool to showcase that you can do
26:39 - this and you know how but i'm not sure
26:41 - if it makes sense on the landing page um
26:43 - the biggest issue here though when i
26:45 - check this out
26:47 - is
26:48 - the
26:49 - headline and the sub headline they're
26:51 - just really i they're they're boring in
26:54 - my opinion um this needs to be enlarged
26:56 - a lot especially in this viewport you
26:58 - know
26:59 - this right here i'm not the size is 2m i
27:02 - mean you could bump that up to like 6m
27:04 - uh or 5m units
27:07 - and
27:08 - that way it's already so much better so
27:10 - look at this scale so this is an issue
27:12 - of a ui design fundamental called scale
27:15 - the size of things it doesn't
27:16 - necessarily have to pertain just to
27:19 - type it could be anything
27:22 - but if i refresh this
27:24 - oh
27:26 - not cool you know so beef that size up
27:29 - considerably
27:31 - this is also lacking
27:33 - a call to action
27:35 - um you know at the very least
27:38 - if you want to tell people to scroll
27:39 - down go ahead and do that
27:41 - these up here i wouldn't call these
27:43 - really any any sorts of a primary call
27:46 - to action so same thing with this over
27:48 - here just kind of gets lost sometimes
27:49 - it's
27:50 - not immediately identifiable so you want
27:53 - to give somebody you know an area where
27:56 - you know they need to click and
27:58 - where they have to click that's up to
28:00 - you and that's a ux concern where is it
28:03 - that you want them to land
28:05 - first
28:08 - so just this is quite a long about us
28:10 - section
28:12 - i at the very least if you're going to
28:13 - keep all this text maybe use um two
28:16 - different paragraphs because it's kind
28:17 - of like a wall of text so peop people
28:20 - don't like reading that
28:22 - um
28:23 - this is these cards you gotta scrap
28:26 - those
28:26 - um
28:27 - in what by i mean scrap i mean you need
28:29 - to change up the design uh the borders
28:32 - plus the thick
28:34 - uh drop shadow makes it look amateur and
28:38 - dated
28:39 - so i mean i'll guarantee you right now i
28:42 - can fix these up
28:44 - the box shadow get rid of that so there
28:47 - we go we've already simplified it much
28:49 - more you add these back and it just
28:51 - looks cheesy so you don't need that um
28:54 - you could
28:56 - where's the border at um
28:58 - trying to find the border
29:04 - i'm not sure where the border property
29:06 - is defined here oh there it is
29:08 - if we get rid of that
29:09 - then
29:10 - we can use this box shadow but it's
29:12 - still the box shadow is still too strong
29:16 - you want to take the opacity which is at
29:18 - point 76
29:20 - um
29:22 - drop it down a lot
29:24 - like
29:26 - 0.2 and then we could probably increase
29:29 - um
29:31 - the blur reverse spread
29:34 - that's better that's a better take so
29:36 - there's
29:37 - when it comes to design ui design as
29:39 - well you know you have a certain amount
29:42 - of subjectivity or in other words
29:44 - personal preferences
29:46 - um so this is one way to take it
29:49 - but what one way i would not take it is
29:52 - this the original
29:57 - i'm not sure why this is
30:00 - you know really emphasized there
30:02 - otherwise if you if you styled it
30:03 - similarly to the rest it would look a
30:04 - lot better it kind of looks out of
30:06 - place and then this is a big issue here
30:09 - these are broken
30:10 - um the little
30:13 - uh circular
30:15 - pagination buttons are overlapping
30:18 - but yeah what do you think this person
30:19 - should get for a rating one being the
30:21 - worst and 10 being the best
30:24 - somebody asked why you should use a
30:26 - label instead of a placeholder the
30:28 - placeholder value
30:29 - when you start typing in that text field
30:31 - or the text area or whatever it's
30:34 - it automatically clears it and then some
30:38 - people may forget what they're entering
30:40 - um
30:41 - and so it becomes an accessibility issue
30:43 - so always having it in plain view makes
30:46 - sense
30:49 - this this definitely is not a one now
30:51 - i've seen ones before and i've rated a
30:53 - few ones this is this is this is higher
30:55 - than a one
30:57 - um
30:58 - but for me i'm gonna have to rate this
30:59 - maybe a little bit lower than normal let
31:02 - me see what it looks like responsively
31:05 - it is responsive
31:08 - so they're doing all that correct
31:17 - i'm going to go ahead and rate this one
31:19 - a
31:27 - about
31:28 - 5.8 or so 5.7
31:35 - all right
31:41 - all right um
31:44 - next up
31:45 - i had just two more that i had you know
31:47 - that i
31:48 - checked out
31:49 - beforehand
31:52 - this
31:53 - is there's a number of issues here with
31:55 - this one
31:56 - so
31:58 - scroll down
32:01 - the biggest issue with this this right
32:03 - here is a is a ux issue it's not even a
32:06 - ui design issue
32:07 - um you're not addressing and telling me
32:09 - what the purpose of the site is about
32:11 - why
32:12 - why do i have to scroll down why should
32:15 - i scroll down why would i want to scroll
32:18 - down
32:19 - people are going to leave this site
32:20 - quickly
32:22 - second
32:23 - i would say
32:25 - having these two
32:26 - navigations like this
32:28 - both encased in this high contrast white
32:31 - area um or this container rather that
32:34 - doesn't make sense
32:35 - um you're if you're gonna do this the
32:37 - navigation makes more sense to do that
32:40 - than this secondary
32:42 - uh and i mean secondary in terms of
32:44 - importance your social navigation so you
32:47 - know
32:48 - one way to fix that because that creates
32:49 - an issue of visual hierarchy is you can
32:51 - just take this
32:53 - and
32:54 - the background is white so what we can
32:56 - do is
32:57 - we'll change that background
33:00 - to just slightly lighter than
33:04 - this
33:06 - and then you would want to take these
33:07 - icons and make them all white and also
33:10 - get rid of this weird block this outer
33:12 - glow that you have
33:13 - and then that way
33:14 - things are kind of restored to normal so
33:17 - scroll down whoa
33:20 - i wasn't
33:21 - i wasn't expecting that initially i did
33:23 - see this before i started the stream but
33:25 - i didn't scroll down so if i start
33:26 - scrolling down things are really
33:28 - happening quickly
33:30 - oh no
33:31 - and if you're gonna do this sort of
33:32 - thing that better be a watermark in the
33:34 - background because now you have visual
33:36 - clutter all over the place
33:39 - you're lacking white space between these
33:41 - sections you don't want to stretch your
33:43 - images like that it does not look good
33:47 - you want to work on your type as well
33:49 - this almost looks like a comic sans
34:00 - i would get rid of this eye border
34:03 - completely unnecessary
34:06 - yeah we just have some issues here you
34:07 - know quite a bit of issues with
34:08 - topography
34:10 - these should be styled a little bit more
34:12 - differently from each other
34:17 - this would be a great example
34:19 - of somebody who could definitely
34:21 - benefit from checking out like my ui
34:23 - design courses i have several that are
34:26 - free on my youtube channel
34:28 - also you can check out skrinba.com i
34:30 - have a ui design bootcamp there
34:32 - because you kind of need to really just
34:34 - start from the beginning um and really
34:36 - learn your ui design fundamentals much
34:38 - more all right so we're going to go
34:40 - ahead and rate this one being the worst
34:42 - and 10 being the best
34:48 - number of ui issues uh ux issues as well
34:51 - so we got to factor those in this is a
34:54 - big no go absolutely not nobody can read
34:56 - this
34:58 - you don't want to have vertical text and
34:59 - paragraphs of vertical text you can get
35:01 - away with it if it's just tiny amounts
35:03 - of
35:04 - text
35:05 - i but when it comes to this no no no no
35:17 - i'm gonna have to give this one i'm
35:19 - looking at the ratings coming in
35:30 - yeah i'm gonna go ahead and give this
35:32 - one
35:34 - a
35:38 - 2.8 or so
35:41 - yeah i think that makes sense
35:44 - all right we have one more
35:46 - um that i i checked out beforehand and
35:49 - then we'll switch to twitter
35:52 - wow quincy gave it a four and i give it
35:54 - a 2.8
35:56 - all
35:56 - right all right so
35:59 - here's one of those issues and one of
36:01 - the dangers
36:03 - of
36:05 - trends design trends um being
36:09 - overused and maybe not being used
36:11 - correctly
36:12 - and that is at the start of this year i
36:14 - did a video about it it was really
36:16 - popular about a new design trend called
36:18 - neomorphism
36:20 - and you could see these buttons with
36:22 - their real soft appearing and stuff and
36:25 - people went crazy on twitter i mean on
36:26 - dribble i
36:28 - because it was really cool the person
36:30 - did it in a really good context for a
36:32 - user interface of an app um but as we
36:35 - could see these
36:37 - it's been applied here what knew more
36:39 - new morphism is
36:41 - is we could see like elements and
36:42 - containers have this light uh
36:46 - shadow over here
36:48 - done achieved through the box shadow
36:49 - property and you can have multiple block
36:51 - shadows and then the second one is just
36:53 - like a shot a darker shadow here and
36:56 - they're real soft
36:57 - but when you do this like on almost
36:59 - every element it just makes it look
37:02 - just too amateur in my opinion because
37:04 - it's very similar to your typical
37:06 - shadows that you've seen that were your
37:09 - drop shadows that we've seen for 20 plus
37:11 - years
37:12 - we have issues with alignment so we have
37:15 - this column that's here but then we have
37:16 - this slightly inset
37:19 - so that's not working out
37:21 - i do like
37:22 - the take though on
37:25 - light and dark mode
37:27 - um
37:28 - these could be okay so for your hot your
37:31 - the hover of these the contrast gets
37:33 - killed with this blue color you're using
37:35 - based on this mid sort of gray color
37:38 - here
37:39 - and another thing that kind of hurts it
37:40 - too is using this mid gray color it kind
37:42 - of just looks bland in my opinion
37:45 - so you need to think about that
37:48 - it looks like you're just taking people
37:49 - straight into your portfolio examples
37:52 - right here but it probably would be it
37:54 - would make sense at least to have a
37:55 - little section at the top that kind of
37:58 - describes
37:59 - what you are and you know what you do it
38:02 - does say front end web developer but
38:04 - you could probably expand on that a
38:06 - little bit more
38:07 - um
38:08 - in sort of like a hero section it
38:10 - doesn't have to be the 100 100 viewport
38:12 - height or whatever but just a section up
38:15 - top instead of just having people go
38:17 - straight hundred percent into your your
38:19 - uh projects
38:23 - all right so what do you think this
38:25 - person should get rated for
38:27 - their
38:29 - portfolio one being the worst in ten
38:30 - being the best
38:39 - let me go ahead and check and see how
38:40 - long we've been streaming
38:46 - all right
38:49 - 38 minutes ago
38:58 - okay try to be constructive by the way
39:06 - i mean if i showed you some of my
39:08 - first designs back in the late 90s yeah
39:12 - you would all die
39:14 - um i'm going to go ahead and give let's
39:16 - see if the let's check responsiveness
39:21 - it is responsive
39:23 - so for this
39:25 - i'm going to go ahead and give it
39:27 - something like around
39:29 - a
39:32 - i think a 4.5 or so would make sense
39:39 - all right now designing sites is not
39:41 - easy it's definitely a skill that has to
39:43 - be learned
39:45 - um
39:46 - in fact
39:47 - let me do something real quick i'm going
39:49 - to take a
39:51 - a little bit of a detour
39:54 - and i'm going to go to my
39:56 - youtube channel
39:58 - and i'm going to go to
40:02 - my search my channel search i'm going to
40:05 - type 1999.
40:07 - here it is lol i found my old design
40:10 - work from 1999 so this is going to make
40:13 - a lot of you feel better
40:15 - if you watch this video
40:17 - um
40:19 - and this is when i put this out about
40:21 - three years ago this video
40:22 - and if i i'm going to scroll just to
40:24 - show you some of my designs back in
40:28 - like there are some that are from 1998 i
40:31 - think
40:32 - um and you're going to see some of my
40:33 - designs like that was my portfolio look
40:36 - at that
40:37 - this was i when i was
40:39 - i created a lot of portfolios like
40:42 - that's almost all of my work comprised
40:45 - of was
40:46 - like that's how i got practice by by
40:48 - making a million portfolios um designs
40:51 - like look at this my skills
40:53 - flash three four i have three years
40:56 - experience html dhtml
40:58 - java
41:00 - i never mess with java i don't know why
41:02 - i even put that maybe i meant javascript
41:05 - mysql php
41:07 - visual basic
41:08 - i was one of those horrible people who
41:12 - created aol apps or they were called
41:14 - progs back then or progs for like
41:18 - kicking people offline and stuff like
41:19 - punters and stuff um but that's kind of
41:22 - how i learned to code um
41:24 - but yeah just looking through this i'm
41:26 - looking
41:27 - there's a lot i mean look at this
41:30 - now get
41:31 - you have to remember look at that you
41:33 - have to remember that this was this is
41:35 - actually i was really proud of this one
41:36 - it was really unique back then
41:38 - um
41:40 - this is one of my first portfolios right
41:41 - here
41:43 - hi my name is gary simon i'm 16 years
41:46 - old and i live in warren ohio i mean can
41:48 - you imagine this i mean so yeah i mean
41:51 - this is all learned stuff then i started
41:53 - to get better
41:55 - eventually oh this i was showing uh
41:57 - slicing which was a front-end
41:58 - development technique
42:00 - way back a long time ago
42:04 - so i i got you know quite a bit better
42:06 - as
42:07 - you know
42:08 - i kept practicing all right
42:11 - so now let's keep on uh now we're gonna
42:14 - switch gears and i'm not gonna i'm gonna
42:16 - take uh doing reviews that i haven't
42:18 - seen yet so
42:20 - um let's go to twitter
42:23 - and we're going to search for
42:26 - live ui ux
42:31 - review
42:35 - latest
42:38 - you got a speeding ticket more in ohio
42:40 - yep so did i
42:43 - all right so let's just check some of
42:45 - these out i'm going to try to avoid
42:46 - prototypes i want to do live
42:49 - websites
42:51 - i'm going to move them off
42:57 - all right so here's one
43:01 - all right
43:03 - so okay
43:05 - welcome to david's portfolio this page
43:07 - is being tested on different devices as
43:09 - of september 15 2020 you may continue
43:14 - huge ux issue don't do this
43:16 - nobody cares if you're you're testing it
43:19 - on different devices like this is this
43:21 - should be assumed so
43:23 - don't do that
43:25 - let them go to your main user interface
43:29 - and this is one of those things i
43:31 - where
43:33 - someone in your shoes if you're the
43:35 - person who created this or if you're
43:36 - somebody creating things like this
43:38 - definitely go back to the drawing board
43:40 - when it comes to ui design watch my my
43:43 - crash courses on my channel
43:46 - i have ui ux design crash courses and
43:49 - front end development crash courses as
43:52 - well because there's just too many
43:53 - things that are happening here for me to
43:55 - sit here and try to give this a
43:57 - comprehensive review
43:58 - um
43:59 - so
44:00 - yeah there's a lot of things that you
44:01 - shouldn't be doing here like the borders
44:03 - are over the place the strong drop
44:05 - shadows this is all just stuff that's
44:07 - very dated and it's been quite a
44:09 - you know
44:10 - the yeah the the shadows everywhere for
44:13 - some reason
44:14 - new ui designers they get excited and in
44:17 - front of developers and they want to use
44:19 - all the cool effects but it's not it's a
44:22 - hindrance try to keep things more simple
44:25 - eye
44:26 - than not so
44:28 - for this one just because there's
44:30 - there's there's so much that needs to be
44:32 - improved we're not even going to bother
44:33 - with a rating let's just move on to
44:35 - another one thank you for the submission
44:37 - though
44:40 - let's see here
44:41 - we got a netlify app one
44:46 - now this to me looks like a a template
44:48 - sorted design but again i don't like
44:50 - making the assumption that
44:52 - these are templates um
44:55 - cosse
44:58 - all right pretty solid here but you know
45:00 - when you get out to these
45:02 - large
45:04 - one second here when you get out to
45:06 - these larger
45:07 - uh resolution like this is 4k right here
45:10 - um it just seems like it's a little bit
45:12 - too stretched out like it might make
45:14 - sense to take this nav
45:17 - net this nav bar here and create and
45:19 - make it into a
45:20 - fixed centered container kind of like
45:22 - how
45:23 - this is right here
45:25 - outside of that it's simple
45:28 - i mean it's ultra simple
45:32 - i like the little um
45:34 - this type of uh
45:37 - gallery right here
45:40 - like the masonry
45:41 - gallery style
45:43 - this is all pretty
45:45 - pretty decent looking
45:47 - i don't really have an issue with this
45:50 - yeah this is a great example of a really
45:52 - simple
45:53 - design
45:55 - that i it works well though has all the
45:57 - ui design fundamentals there we have
45:59 - good contrast we have good white space
46:02 - we have good alignment for the most part
46:05 - uh good visual hierarchy
46:08 - so i can't really say anything too wrong
46:10 - uh this right here though that's
46:13 - you need more line height for sure on
46:15 - that
46:16 - i probably want to use a better ad copy
46:19 - for this a spring sale of 30 that
46:22 - doesn't i would put that as like a
46:23 - subtitle but then use something that's
46:26 - completely different above that so one
46:28 - being the worst tammy and the best what
46:30 - do you people think this person should
46:31 - get for a rating
46:40 - i already know what i'm going to rate it
46:56 - yeah
46:57 - for me i'm going to give this a
47:00 - let's see here
47:05 - 7.8 or so
47:11 - yeah i think that's fair i mean again
47:13 - when i say 7.8 you know this could be
47:17 - depending on when you ask me like we
47:19 - could have
47:20 - like a three-tenths variation one way or
47:22 - the other
47:24 - let's check out some more
47:29 - 360
47:30 - magnet solutions so i'm always moving
47:33 - these off just to make sure
47:35 - that there are designs that i can
47:37 - present
47:40 - all right okay
47:42 - i was getting i was getting a little bit
47:43 - worried because i i was
47:45 - i was what we were like almost 50
47:48 - minutes into this i think
47:50 - yeah 47 minutes um and we didn't have
47:52 - any of these uh
47:54 - the whole crazy vector
47:57 - animated designs occurring
47:59 - all right so the first issue with this
48:02 - design
48:03 - is this image right here for one
48:06 - it's pixelated it's a photograph so you
48:09 - should
48:10 - never use
48:12 - type
48:13 - baked into photographs like jpegs or
48:15 - pngs or whatever
48:17 - this is meant to be red easily
48:20 - and it's just not working here so if
48:22 - you're going to use a photograph make
48:23 - sure it's of like
48:24 - non-typography things second
48:27 - the type is just really large and it's
48:30 - suffering from a lack of white space
48:32 - and it's really spread out so
48:34 - i would just if you're going to use this
48:36 - this uh
48:38 - design right here or this photograph
48:39 - rather get rid of the type
48:41 - in the image
48:43 - leave this white background here and
48:44 - then just use html to put the the images
48:47 - on top
48:48 - um
48:50 - baking the type into the
48:53 - image or the photograph that's something
48:55 - that we used to do back during the
48:56 - slicing days sometimes
48:59 - you don't want to do that now
49:01 - outside of that
49:04 - this right here the animations
49:06 - completely unnecessary they're they're
49:08 - distracting so i remove that even though
49:11 - it's cool
49:12 - it's just not it serves no purpose
49:16 - outside here
49:17 - the next section
49:19 - yeah
49:20 - you're having issues with alignment
49:22 - because the bottom of this
49:23 - it's wrapping around this image but
49:25 - really this whole
49:27 - left portion should be maintained uh
49:30 - because it's just throwing off the flow
49:32 - of the type
49:33 - you also have quite a bit of type here
49:35 - i'm not sure if everybody
49:38 - or most people will want to read through
49:39 - all this so you might benefit by
49:41 - reducing the amount of type here also
49:45 - the type is a little bit screwed up
49:47 - because you have you have this larger
49:49 - this this one this right here is fine
49:51 - but then you have a smaller type
49:54 - as a sub headline
49:56 - not enough white space but then you have
49:58 - slightly larger type here so
50:00 - things are thrown off like the size of
50:03 - this type should be the size uh
50:05 - of this type or vice versa
50:07 - um and you need more white space like
50:09 - let me show you how easily i could just
50:11 - improve this area in a second so like
50:14 - margin bottom
50:17 - okay that's not working
50:21 - oh it's oh there we go
50:23 - uh margin bottom
50:27 - all right so we've moved moved things
50:29 - away just a little bit and then
50:32 - we also have
50:35 - this element
50:38 - margin top
50:42 - oh what is happening here there we go
50:45 - margin top
50:48 - there so i fixed the white space issues
50:50 - at least with this part
50:52 - but again we have those other issues
50:54 - here that need to be addressed
50:56 - um digital agency
50:58 - services this part's
51:00 - not
51:01 - not too bad actually
51:07 - i've never really been a fan of having
51:09 - embedded youtube videos just because
51:11 - they kind of uh
51:13 - it's hard to make them look good
51:15 - especially like depending on what the
51:17 - thumbnail looks like and also the
51:19 - default ui design for the embedded
51:21 - controls
51:22 - so you might wanna just have a button
51:24 - here that just launches into it perhaps
51:27 - or you can actually i think with the
51:29 - youtube player api you can have your own
51:31 - custom
51:32 - uh
51:33 - splash image and then when people click
51:35 - on it then it will it'll play right
51:37 - inside of their
51:38 - um their ui design
51:42 - all right so what do you think this
51:44 - person should get for a rating
51:46 - by far i mean this stuff is better
51:48 - this page or this sections these are
51:51 - sections right here are better than
51:52 - what's happening up here the biggest
51:53 - issue is this background you have to fix
51:56 - that
51:57 - one being the worst 10 being the best
51:58 - let me know what you all think
52:15 - let's see if it's responsive
52:20 - it is
52:21 - so that's working out at least
52:35 - now i'm going to go ahead and give this
52:36 - one a
52:44 - 4.5 or so
52:47 - seems like most of you are rating it a
52:48 - little bit higher
52:52 - all right let's check out uh let's see
52:54 - how long we've been doing this about
52:55 - eight minutes we probably do um one or
52:57 - two more
52:58 - um so let's continue on
53:01 - um
53:08 - simple website made for learning
53:10 - purposes
53:12 - all right
53:14 - uh let's see here
53:19 - yeah it is definitely on the simple side
53:22 - um and that's okay i usually it's better
53:25 - than than trying to make things complex
53:27 - because we see what that does
53:29 - okay what's interesting is
53:32 - if you go to my youtube channel i just
53:34 - did a video
53:38 - about
53:39 - full screen navigations
53:41 - and i did link a video because it was
53:44 - supposed to be included in this one
53:46 - about the ui in the ux of full screen
53:48 - navigations so if you come to this url
53:52 - definitely check this out
53:55 - because
53:56 - i talk about
53:58 - this sort of thing right here
54:01 - this here
54:02 - don't do that
54:04 - on desktop i because uh there's a few
54:07 - reasons why the main the the primary
54:10 - reason is when you have this hamburger
54:12 - on desktop you're requiring a user to
54:14 - click
54:15 - to access links that would otherwise
54:17 - already fit
54:19 - right here
54:20 - so that's just it's a bad pattern to use
54:24 - of course if we're talking about
54:26 - mobile design you don't have all that
54:28 - physical room to place these links you
54:30 - can do this
54:32 - all right but not when you get out to
54:34 - around here and you have enough space
54:36 - so use and adjust your media queries
54:38 - accordingly
54:40 - outside of that um
54:43 - it's a little bit it's a little bit
54:45 - boring i would say for this this
54:46 - particular illustration um you might
54:49 - want to try to either get a custom one
54:51 - or a rethink or get a different one
54:53 - um
54:57 - i'm not a fan of see i would rather have
54:59 - your your call to action because it's
55:01 - really important that it sticks out
55:03 - be styled like the hover state rather
55:05 - than the default state right here
55:08 - the borders just kind of add a little
55:09 - bit more complexity
55:11 - this makes it more simple but it also
55:13 - stands out more too
55:15 - so i would change that
55:17 - and if you have all this empty space
55:19 - here
55:20 - um you could probably
55:22 - restructure things a little bit more to
55:24 - where
55:26 - this type
55:27 - is larger
55:29 - so we can bump that up to like twice the
55:31 - size no not not twice the size
55:34 - like 6.5 rem units possibly
55:38 - now that's looking a little bit better
55:39 - it's filling things out this then can
55:41 - become larger as well
55:44 - not the same size or anywhere near the
55:46 - same size as this but it can still be
55:47 - larger and then you'll fill out this
55:49 - area a bit more
55:51 - who we are i've pushed this stuff down
55:53 - just a tad bit more more white space
55:55 - beneath this it's a little bit too close
55:57 - to this text area
55:59 - and also when it comes to these
56:00 - photographs or these illustrations
56:03 - you know one way to do it is way you're
56:04 - doing it just put it right there and
56:06 - slap it there but you can also um use it
56:08 - as a background image and make them real
56:10 - large and kind of like
56:12 - offs off
56:13 - it's hard for me to explain but um you
56:16 - can have it so that these are enlarged a
56:18 - lot larger and they can even be cut off
56:21 - to the half of the screen and then
56:22 - coming in naturally it kind of it's a
56:24 - more unique approach um and a more
56:26 - appealing visually appealing approach in
56:28 - my opinion
56:31 - this part looks pretty decent make this
56:33 - bold and maybe a little bit larger more
56:35 - white space between this section and
56:37 - that right here
56:38 - but
56:39 - overall it's pretty good
56:42 - um i probably get rid of the thin
56:44 - borders around these areas you don't
56:45 - need those
56:47 - all right so what do you people think
56:49 - this person should get for a rating one
56:50 - being the worst and 10 being the best
57:02 - i'm going to refresh to see just to show
57:04 - you what it originally looked like and
57:06 - we can see there was definitely an
57:07 - improvement by making that larger
57:17 - it is responsive
57:21 - um i'm gonna go ahead and give this one
57:25 - like a
57:37 - yeah probably like a
57:40 - 6.4 or so 6.5
57:45 - all right thank you for that submission
57:48 - um
57:49 - we've been streaming for 57 minutes
57:52 - apparently so i'm going to go ahead and
57:53 - give this uh probably we'll do one more
57:59 - one more review
58:00 - let's go ahead and i'll refresh
58:05 - all right starved
58:07 - collection
58:14 - one second i'm checking it out
58:23 - all right
58:26 - so first
58:28 - let's refresh it so you can see what you
58:30 - experience on load
58:33 - so by default we have a
58:36 - we have a um a an embedded youtube
58:39 - player that's starting automatically
58:42 - probably wouldn't do that we could see
58:44 - the at least it is muted by default
58:48 - but
58:50 - there's a more
58:51 - there's more interesting ways you can go
58:53 - about doing something like this you
58:54 - could take this video clip and then
58:57 - um
58:58 - you can make it as a part of like a hero
59:00 - section like a watermark or whatever
59:02 - because
59:03 - again you're not
59:05 - it's being muted anyway um and then also
59:08 - continue to cite
59:10 - huge ux no we don't do that anymore the
59:12 - whole splash page thing
59:14 - um you want to bring them to your site
59:16 - by default already the main site with
59:19 - your user interface
59:20 - so if i click on continue to cite
59:23 - this is what we are presented with which
59:25 - unfortunately there's not much semblance
59:27 - of a user interface here it just looks
59:29 - like we have a navigation up top the
59:32 - logo over here
59:34 - and then we have just kind of like a
59:36 - random
59:37 - band graphic
59:38 - over here with tour dates
59:40 - um so i think there needs to be more of
59:42 - a restructuring you know music sites are
59:46 - fun because they're really unique uh and
59:48 - they're creative and so i would maybe
59:51 - i'll even do a video about maybe just
59:53 - compiling some of the most unique or
59:55 - interesting
59:56 - effective and non-effective
59:58 - banned websites because they like like i
60:00 - said by nature they're usually really
60:02 - cool looking and they're very different
60:04 - they're able to do different things
60:06 - because they're based on a creative
60:07 - industry
60:08 - um but
60:10 - i would like to see like for instance
60:12 - the navigation kind of seems more of an
60:14 - afterthought
60:15 - in this context and we have photographs
60:18 - overlapping each other
60:20 - um and so there's not a strong semblance
60:22 - of a ui here
60:23 - um
60:25 - like merchandise
60:30 - what happens when i click this probably
60:32 - just scrolls there okay yeah it does
60:37 - and if you're gonna have a merch section
60:38 - usually people want to know how much it
60:40 - costs so including that makes sense and
60:43 - maybe scaling down the size of these and
60:45 - putting them in into actual card
60:47 - containers might make sense as well
60:57 - then again um like your music's uh label
61:01 - and in these two things right here they
61:03 - could be left aligned so having them on
61:06 - top you know it makes more sense to put
61:07 - those in two columns
61:09 - rather than just putting one after the
61:11 - other
61:14 - all right uh what do you think this
61:16 - person should get for a rating one being
61:18 - the worst and 10 being the best remem
61:21 - remember
61:22 - we have this initial page which is a big
61:25 - problem
61:28 - with the uh the whole splash page and
61:29 - requiring people to click here
61:31 - completely just
61:32 - send them right to this page instead but
61:35 - again this has
61:36 - a number of issues that
61:38 - need to be addressed here as well
61:49 - for me i'm just going to go ahead and
61:51 - give this is it responsive i wonder
61:55 - yeah it is
61:57 - i'm going to go ahead and give this a
62:04 - 4.5 or so
62:06 - i think that's pretty fair it seems like
62:08 - most of you agree with me anyhow
62:11 - all right so that here is it so
62:15 - that was the the final stream of
62:19 - the three-part stream series that we've
62:21 - set up with uh free code camp here
62:23 - of course i do this on my own channel uh
62:25 - my own channel is available at
62:28 - youtube.com forward slash design course
62:31 - um i do these like these see here's one
62:33 - i did just four days ago
62:35 - it's the same thing live ui ux review i
62:37 - call it the negative space which is just
62:39 - a play on
62:40 - um ui design fundamental i'm not very
62:43 - that much negative but it's the same
62:44 - exact show that you saw here so if you
62:46 - enjoyed these
62:47 - subscribe to my youtube channel and i do
62:49 - them usually once a week sometimes uh
62:52 - once every two weeks and just do the
62:54 - same exact thing also we're working hard

Cleaned transcript:

everybody we're going to get started momentarily and you could say hi in the chat which i have on the screen here i'll be the first to say hi okay i guess i wasn't hello ali and like i mentioned in case you're just filtering in we're gonna get started here in a minute or two hello quincy founder of free code camp emery hello muhammad sudeep i i'm just i'm terrible at these names all right here they come craig mullins with a verified check mark hello everybody hello hello hello all right so while everybody's getting filtered in um i will go ahead and start the introduction first i'm gary simon i've been a ui ux designer and frontend developer for the last 20plus years i've been an instructor in teaching for the last 10 years and this is the third of the three streams that we've had scheduled uh for myself to stream a live ui ux review show here at free code camp on the youtube channel so perhaps we'll do this again sometime in the future but basically what we're doing is you are submitting your ui designs and i'm reviewing them live here all right so i already have a few picked out but you do that on twitter and you just use the hashtag live ui ux review and i may get you to yours i may not but still there's value even if i don't get to yours because a lot of people make the same mistakes and we can all learn from from each other of course um and so this is uh just a real quick plug uh designcourse.com i'm going to be we're actively working on this and it's going to be the most comprehensive that's my goal at least the most comprehensive service for learning ui ux design um so that's coming in several months time if you want to be notified when that's i released go ahead and enter your email here at designcourse.com and then secondly my youtube channel i right here it's design course it's linked here in the youtube description of this video um so yeah let's go ahead and get started so here's one that i chose this is a levi landing page with gsap all right so if you people don't know what gsap is gsap is an acronym for the green sock animation platform it allows you to do uh more complex animations rather than just using something like straight up css animations um so notice how everything comes in sequentially gsap makes this very easy to do in the front end development process it's javascript library it's very powerful i have several courses on it on my own youtube channel so you can definitely check that out to learn how to do this sort of thing so this is a a nice design overall a there's nothing i can't scroll a lot of this doesn't work so kind of what you see is what you get here um and in terms of the ui design itself i really like it um it's it's unique it's interesting um i don't think see anything that really is coming out as being uh negative with this one um it's using some modern ui design techniques like uh having kind of like this vertical bar over here um the whole circular navigation up here assuming this were ever to be finished so yeah i i like it i can't really say anything negative for what it is so also as a part of these live streams i do um i ask everybody watching here in the youtube chat to give it a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best you have about 15 seconds and then we'll see if i agree with you or not so go ahead and do that one being the worst 10 being the best consider the ui design any ux potential issues you see and factor that into your result somebody's already given it a 10 no he said eight well let's see if this is responsive first of all we could check that out no not quite just kind of made it for desktop should always learn css first and then try to use gsap for your animation purposes okay i'm going to go ahead i'm going to give this one for what it is a straight up 8.1 yeah there we go all right i think it's pretty solid okay next one i have picked out all right so sort of a cool loading animation we saw here let's refresh that very cool um the thing that i notice right off the bat that is an issue is the lack of white space or the too much white space here so this isn't necessarily a white space issue it's an alignment issue this block right here which is comprised of this headline this sub headline and this call to action should all be pushed down considerably so when i say that we're going to give this like a margin top of i don't know 5 m units there we go so now we have almost an equal amount of white space from the top and bottom and now it looks in it's it's quite a bit better i would also probably make this right here a little bit less width um maybe put in on the next line right here that way it gives it a little bit more white space between this element and this element i really like the uh illustration here it being animated like this uh so this makes sense has like you little skeleton ui windows so it's always a good idea to use illustrations that are relevant based on the purpose of the landing page and the surface itself um let's okay up here we have a light and dark mode i kind of don't like this one because you're not sure which one is cho is really chosen yeah this is light version obviously but it should be a little bit more obvious like this should be filled in here perhaps already by default and sometimes to me i wasn't even sure what this was at a glance i thought it was like a chocolate chip cookie but just the moon but look checking this out anyhow this is pretty good um just for how everything reacts when you're switching from light to dark all right coming down one thing i do want to say is this this section right here this container because it's a very very subtle difference from this white to this very light desaturated sort of blue i think it's not enough contrast i think we needed to just maybe a little bit make that a tad bit darker so you can see it's almost white up here in the color picker so if we come down just a little bit i think that's better so now we can clearly see the separation of these two you know this this section up here which is traditionally called the hero section and then this section right here so i would say the same thing about this section over here same color you'd want to change it to up here so you have a more of a distinction between these containers so if i refresh it you'll see the original and it just kind of makes it a little bit harder to see the card and this section being separated itself this i really like this section right here um everything is is i aligned correctly there's a good white space the topography is good there's a good visual hierarchy which is reinforced by the fact that you know your different pieces of type are um changed and they're separated with each other to create that hierarchy through uh the font weight through the font size and contrast between these elements so those three things will really give you good topography if you understand how to apply them so and this is all pretty solid i like the icons they're simple this here again you could probably on it on a large viewport like this put in three or four of these um in a different columns so three instead of just having two because that really makes them really large i'd probably put at least three when you're out here in the larger viewports but other than that this is all solid i like the the type inside we're using labels on your forum that's excellent you should always have a contact form on your site don't just put your email address like a mail to link or something i always have a form that people can contact you with but i would also say always give them a way to email that you if they wish instead of using your form so offer both you want to give them as many ways to contact you as possible this is solid though so i what do you think this person should get for a rating for their portfolio one being the worst 10 the best i think the biggest issue was just this area right here too much white space get that centered here vertically oh we got a chat thank you for that which goes to free code camp one being the worst 10 mean the best get your answers in is another high higher rated entry for sure so for me i'm going to go ahead and give this one and 8.3 or so i i notice so there's a lot of eights there's a lot of nines there's some sevens so yeah pretty pretty solid quincy says seven he wasn't as impressed okay all right next up is going to be an adobe xd prototype all right so what we have here is digital marketing agency um there's several areas that we can click one thing just about the topography i like the colors um this seems to be a good font size this is the mont cigarette type of uh font family which i know because i use forever and i still use um i think a little bit more line height it's a little bit scrunched up in my opinion um so i would increase the line height just a bit um outside of that pretty solid uh call to action here so adobe xd has the ability to animate on hover um i'm not sure if i would increase the size of these honestly on hover but uh nonetheless your alignment's good you notice you're in the the very first link the home nav uh defines a column here and then right along this column is the rest of this content and that that creates a nice uniform consistent layout it just makes it look better um one thing i don't like is that me our team button the the gray the mid gray right here it's very hard to to use mid gray effectively in the ui design um in this button here being blue it doesn't contrast very well so i would change this color to to something else you could either go light i probably wouldn't make it this blue color because then it competes uh for your your primary call to action so i would use maybe a really dark maybe very you know almost as dark as this for the background here next up looking at this area this area it's designed well like the cards it has good white space inside however it's a little bit confusing um because you've chosen to emphasize a few over the others and i'm not sure if that's necessarily what you wanted to do um so sometimes also i don't know what these little dots are for it almost makes me think like there might be some sort of weird inner navigation within this this card so it's kind of confusing um but i would probably opt just to style them all the same unless there's some type of reason that you want to emphasize one or the other over the other next up this is this right here is pretty solid and this is kind of quite bordery or lining if you will you could probably either drop the uh significantly on the border you know making it just a very dark gray or you could get rid of the border entirely and make the background of this card i just a little like a shade lighter than the background um that way it won't feel like so many lines it's fine here because you really want to emphasize this middle one but it becomes a little bit cluttered in my opinion with the extra borders and always make sure you're using labels so if you're these look like they would be placeholder values and you don't want to rely on those make sure they're floating good call to action here and yeah again same comments about this this mid gray all right what do you think this person should get rated one being the worst and 10 being the best you have about 15 seconds to get your answers in the font family for that one was monsterat which you can download that that's available for you google fonts i've been hitting the gym hard so i'm like i need to stretch i'm like very sore right now oh we got a lot of ratings that came in all the way all right so for me um based on what i see here it's it's overall this part's a little bit cluttered and misaligned um but overall it's pretty decent there's no significant issues here so i'm going to rate this uh like a 6.9 maybe even a 7 or so i think that's pretty fair based on what i've rated the other ones all right so let's do yet another one so we've been looking at some pretty decent uh entries up to this point so far um this one needs some work though a little bit more than the other ones so why do i say that well first of all the first issue that i notice here is alignment all right so we have this logo right here in the logo by the way there's too much type in that logo i'm not sure whoever created this if you have control over the logo which you might not because you're a ui or designer or you're a friend of developer whatever um there's just i would have it refactored there's just too much type occurring here outside of that though it creates a a a column here and it in in also in and of itself if we're just going to take a look at the nav bar which is which is the logo plus this navigation right here navigation is completely fluid all the way to the right of the browser and then this is just kind of pushed over like randomly if it's going to be really fluid then this should be pushed over all the way over here as well to create that nice symmetry um but one thing so we have that issue but then the next issue is you have this column defined by all the type right here so it's thrown off in a couple of different ways the best way to deal with this is to take this logo put it right here and then also take this navigation and put it the contact us should probably end right here and so it would go like this length and then if you're kind of worried about the navigation being a little bit too close at that point to the logo because it'll be moved here and this will be moved in the middle um you could expand the width of this this fixed container that's centered here at this resolution or this this eye viewport all right after that there's not a ton of contrast with this red and this background you can read it but when you get to this this area is pretty fine because it's dark but when you get over here to this table or whatever it is it it there's not you could have more contrast this could even possibly be white the way to fix that is multiple ways changing the color of the type on top like making it completely white or further taking this photograph and making it darker there's an issue also with your call to actions so we have three different buttons in this area call us send us a message in free estimate that are all designed in the same exact manner so that's a lack of visual hierarchy the free estimate button is probably going to be the one that's most important and the one that you want people to to click on so every every page should have a goal of some sort and this one clearly it would probably be to free us to get a free estimate also a free estimate i'm not sure what that entails verse call us i guess this is just the phone number and then to send us a message so if you want to have these buttons here make style them differently it's so that they don't catch as much attention from the eye that this one does this one should this is what you want people to use so style these differently i wouldn't use red as a background for these there's a lot of different ways you can do it to have secondary call to actions and also this kind of seems just misplaced i would place these maybe underneath the free estimate or to the right of the free estimate button outside of that this part's pretty decent right here in the middle there's nothing really a hundred percent wrong uh happening at basically for the most part everywhere else whenever you have two columns like this here's the left column and here's the right column i prefer to not center text that's in the right or left maybe just left align these elements and that way you really define this this this uh column right here outside of that that is it and it's uh there's just a few small things that could improve it what do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the very best quincy asked i've heard the right number of call to actions is always one are there exceptions to that i think it depends on what you may define as a call to action so um if there should always be at least a primary call to action and if we're talking primary then by nature we're talking one so yes you'd be correct um in this case uh we we have a lot of secondary sort of call to actions if you will or you know areas that people could actually leave um and in that case they should be not styled as prominently as that primary one if that makes sense so for this one i'm going to go ahead and give this i mean there's not a lot of like horrible things happening here so for me i'm going to give this one like a a 6.2 or so once he's uh says 5.5 i think he's just a little bit we're pretty much consistent in in our ratings though a little bit lower than what i'm writing all right i oh there we go 47roofconstruction.com all right so this this layout to me it feels dated it's uh it's like back in 2013 2014 2015 these are the type of like layouts that i saw often um it has the logo here and has like these little areas where you can have you know the access to to call the people there's also the address um we have a very standard um hero section with the centered area here and my dog is barking down there um having said that i guess you could you can maybe take a little bit of a point away just because it's dated however the things that we need to be most certain of is that the ui in the ux is working well so in that case i can't really say there's anything too wrong sorry my voice is cracking up about what i see here request a complimentary inspection today that's a good headline get in touch i would probably bold up the white because this green versus this white text you lose a little bit of contrast there so i might use it maybe a slightly darker green or bold up and make it a little bit larger this getting touch button where does a get in touch button do um is there a contact page unfortunately it's kind of a slow loading right now and it's not secure maybe this isn't live yet i'm not sure one of one of here's a tip if you ever want to increase your leads and this would be considered a lead if somebody contacts you using this contact form i would and you only have a few or a small amount of fields that you're requesting there's one of two things you could do you could just take this feel free to contact us page and you could put this in a right column and then left align this in the left column that way it's one less click that people have to to to to to do in order to get in touch with you uh especially if you have a server that this is being hosted on that's kind of slow because that took too much too long way too long to get to that page so you're gonna reduce your your bounce rate you're going to increase your amount of leads and the other way to approach it is maybe just if you have more fields than you're comfortable with putting you know in your hero section of the landing page then maybe just put one or two and then it will just take them to the next one because they're already invested i in filling out all the the information outside of that about us maybe a little bit more white space here we are insurance experts contact us yeah i mean this is all it's all pretty solid here i don't see anything that's that's coming out and just being completely wrong with exception to this area because they're only placeholder values we want to make this accessible so make sure you use the labels as always all right so one being the worst ten being the best what do you think this person should get for a rating some people are saying five five three i'm going to go ahead and say let's see let's see if at least if it's working responsibly and it is yeah so for me oh we agree this time i'm going to say maybe around 6.5 to like a 6.8 or maybe even close to a seven now that i think about it yeah so pretty solid here all right um next up this is like an english learning app of some sort um it's a yeah english leading course center all right um by the way like if it's a template there's no way for me to know if it's a template or not um so i always just make the assumption that it's not a template um so okay first thing i think is a little strange is this this little settings cog like what does that do theme color oh interesting okay so they let you choose the theme here which on a landing page i'm not too certain makes that much sense to be honest with you um random background right bullet i mean it's cool to showcase that you can do this and you know how but i'm not sure if it makes sense on the landing page um the biggest issue here though when i check this out is the headline and the sub headline they're just really i they're they're boring in my opinion um this needs to be enlarged a lot especially in this viewport you know this right here i'm not the size is 2m i mean you could bump that up to like 6m uh or 5m units and that way it's already so much better so look at this scale so this is an issue of a ui design fundamental called scale the size of things it doesn't necessarily have to pertain just to type it could be anything but if i refresh this oh not cool you know so beef that size up considerably this is also lacking a call to action um you know at the very least if you want to tell people to scroll down go ahead and do that these up here i wouldn't call these really any any sorts of a primary call to action so same thing with this over here just kind of gets lost sometimes it's not immediately identifiable so you want to give somebody you know an area where you know they need to click and where they have to click that's up to you and that's a ux concern where is it that you want them to land first so just this is quite a long about us section i at the very least if you're going to keep all this text maybe use um two different paragraphs because it's kind of like a wall of text so peop people don't like reading that um this is these cards you gotta scrap those um in what by i mean scrap i mean you need to change up the design uh the borders plus the thick uh drop shadow makes it look amateur and dated so i mean i'll guarantee you right now i can fix these up the box shadow get rid of that so there we go we've already simplified it much more you add these back and it just looks cheesy so you don't need that um you could where's the border at um trying to find the border i'm not sure where the border property is defined here oh there it is if we get rid of that then we can use this box shadow but it's still the box shadow is still too strong you want to take the opacity which is at point 76 um drop it down a lot like 0.2 and then we could probably increase um the blur reverse spread that's better that's a better take so there's when it comes to design ui design as well you know you have a certain amount of subjectivity or in other words personal preferences um so this is one way to take it but what one way i would not take it is this the original i'm not sure why this is you know really emphasized there otherwise if you if you styled it similarly to the rest it would look a lot better it kind of looks out of place and then this is a big issue here these are broken um the little uh circular pagination buttons are overlapping but yeah what do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best somebody asked why you should use a label instead of a placeholder the placeholder value when you start typing in that text field or the text area or whatever it's it automatically clears it and then some people may forget what they're entering um and so it becomes an accessibility issue so always having it in plain view makes sense this this definitely is not a one now i've seen ones before and i've rated a few ones this is this is this is higher than a one um but for me i'm gonna have to rate this maybe a little bit lower than normal let me see what it looks like responsively it is responsive so they're doing all that correct i'm going to go ahead and rate this one a about 5.8 or so 5.7 all right all right um next up i had just two more that i had you know that i checked out beforehand this is there's a number of issues here with this one so scroll down the biggest issue with this this right here is a is a ux issue it's not even a ui design issue um you're not addressing and telling me what the purpose of the site is about why why do i have to scroll down why should i scroll down why would i want to scroll down people are going to leave this site quickly second i would say having these two navigations like this both encased in this high contrast white area um or this container rather that doesn't make sense um you're if you're gonna do this the navigation makes more sense to do that than this secondary uh and i mean secondary in terms of importance your social navigation so you know one way to fix that because that creates an issue of visual hierarchy is you can just take this and the background is white so what we can do is we'll change that background to just slightly lighter than this and then you would want to take these icons and make them all white and also get rid of this weird block this outer glow that you have and then that way things are kind of restored to normal so scroll down whoa i wasn't i wasn't expecting that initially i did see this before i started the stream but i didn't scroll down so if i start scrolling down things are really happening quickly oh no and if you're gonna do this sort of thing that better be a watermark in the background because now you have visual clutter all over the place you're lacking white space between these sections you don't want to stretch your images like that it does not look good you want to work on your type as well this almost looks like a comic sans i would get rid of this eye border completely unnecessary yeah we just have some issues here you know quite a bit of issues with topography these should be styled a little bit more differently from each other this would be a great example of somebody who could definitely benefit from checking out like my ui design courses i have several that are free on my youtube channel also you can check out skrinba.com i have a ui design bootcamp there because you kind of need to really just start from the beginning um and really learn your ui design fundamentals much more all right so we're going to go ahead and rate this one being the worst and 10 being the best number of ui issues uh ux issues as well so we got to factor those in this is a big no go absolutely not nobody can read this you don't want to have vertical text and paragraphs of vertical text you can get away with it if it's just tiny amounts of text i but when it comes to this no no no no i'm gonna have to give this one i'm looking at the ratings coming in yeah i'm gonna go ahead and give this one a 2.8 or so yeah i think that makes sense all right we have one more um that i i checked out beforehand and then we'll switch to twitter wow quincy gave it a four and i give it a 2.8 all right all right so here's one of those issues and one of the dangers of trends design trends um being overused and maybe not being used correctly and that is at the start of this year i did a video about it it was really popular about a new design trend called neomorphism and you could see these buttons with their real soft appearing and stuff and people went crazy on twitter i mean on dribble i because it was really cool the person did it in a really good context for a user interface of an app um but as we could see these it's been applied here what knew more new morphism is is we could see like elements and containers have this light uh shadow over here done achieved through the box shadow property and you can have multiple block shadows and then the second one is just like a shot a darker shadow here and they're real soft but when you do this like on almost every element it just makes it look just too amateur in my opinion because it's very similar to your typical shadows that you've seen that were your drop shadows that we've seen for 20 plus years we have issues with alignment so we have this column that's here but then we have this slightly inset so that's not working out i do like the take though on light and dark mode um these could be okay so for your hot your the hover of these the contrast gets killed with this blue color you're using based on this mid sort of gray color here and another thing that kind of hurts it too is using this mid gray color it kind of just looks bland in my opinion so you need to think about that it looks like you're just taking people straight into your portfolio examples right here but it probably would be it would make sense at least to have a little section at the top that kind of describes what you are and you know what you do it does say front end web developer but you could probably expand on that a little bit more um in sort of like a hero section it doesn't have to be the 100 100 viewport height or whatever but just a section up top instead of just having people go straight hundred percent into your your uh projects all right so what do you think this person should get rated for their portfolio one being the worst in ten being the best let me go ahead and check and see how long we've been streaming all right 38 minutes ago okay try to be constructive by the way i mean if i showed you some of my first designs back in the late 90s yeah you would all die um i'm going to go ahead and give let's see if the let's check responsiveness it is responsive so for this i'm going to go ahead and give it something like around a i think a 4.5 or so would make sense all right now designing sites is not easy it's definitely a skill that has to be learned um in fact let me do something real quick i'm going to take a a little bit of a detour and i'm going to go to my youtube channel and i'm going to go to my search my channel search i'm going to type 1999. here it is lol i found my old design work from 1999 so this is going to make a lot of you feel better if you watch this video um and this is when i put this out about three years ago this video and if i i'm going to scroll just to show you some of my designs back in like there are some that are from 1998 i think um and you're going to see some of my designs like that was my portfolio look at that this was i when i was i created a lot of portfolios like that's almost all of my work comprised of was like that's how i got practice by by making a million portfolios um designs like look at this my skills flash three four i have three years experience html dhtml java i never mess with java i don't know why i even put that maybe i meant javascript mysql php visual basic i was one of those horrible people who created aol apps or they were called progs back then or progs for like kicking people offline and stuff like punters and stuff um but that's kind of how i learned to code um but yeah just looking through this i'm looking there's a lot i mean look at this now get you have to remember look at that you have to remember that this was this is actually i was really proud of this one it was really unique back then um this is one of my first portfolios right here hi my name is gary simon i'm 16 years old and i live in warren ohio i mean can you imagine this i mean so yeah i mean this is all learned stuff then i started to get better eventually oh this i was showing uh slicing which was a frontend development technique way back a long time ago so i i got you know quite a bit better as you know i kept practicing all right so now let's keep on uh now we're gonna switch gears and i'm not gonna i'm gonna take uh doing reviews that i haven't seen yet so um let's go to twitter and we're going to search for live ui ux review latest you got a speeding ticket more in ohio yep so did i all right so let's just check some of these out i'm going to try to avoid prototypes i want to do live websites i'm going to move them off all right so here's one all right so okay welcome to david's portfolio this page is being tested on different devices as of september 15 2020 you may continue huge ux issue don't do this nobody cares if you're you're testing it on different devices like this is this should be assumed so don't do that let them go to your main user interface and this is one of those things i where someone in your shoes if you're the person who created this or if you're somebody creating things like this definitely go back to the drawing board when it comes to ui design watch my my crash courses on my channel i have ui ux design crash courses and front end development crash courses as well because there's just too many things that are happening here for me to sit here and try to give this a comprehensive review um so yeah there's a lot of things that you shouldn't be doing here like the borders are over the place the strong drop shadows this is all just stuff that's very dated and it's been quite a you know the yeah the the shadows everywhere for some reason new ui designers they get excited and in front of developers and they want to use all the cool effects but it's not it's a hindrance try to keep things more simple eye than not so for this one just because there's there's there's so much that needs to be improved we're not even going to bother with a rating let's just move on to another one thank you for the submission though let's see here we got a netlify app one now this to me looks like a a template sorted design but again i don't like making the assumption that these are templates um cosse all right pretty solid here but you know when you get out to these large one second here when you get out to these larger uh resolution like this is 4k right here um it just seems like it's a little bit too stretched out like it might make sense to take this nav net this nav bar here and create and make it into a fixed centered container kind of like how this is right here outside of that it's simple i mean it's ultra simple i like the little um this type of uh gallery right here like the masonry gallery style this is all pretty pretty decent looking i don't really have an issue with this yeah this is a great example of a really simple design that i it works well though has all the ui design fundamentals there we have good contrast we have good white space we have good alignment for the most part uh good visual hierarchy so i can't really say anything too wrong uh this right here though that's you need more line height for sure on that i probably want to use a better ad copy for this a spring sale of 30 that doesn't i would put that as like a subtitle but then use something that's completely different above that so one being the worst tammy and the best what do you people think this person should get for a rating i already know what i'm going to rate it yeah for me i'm going to give this a let's see here 7.8 or so yeah i think that's fair i mean again when i say 7.8 you know this could be depending on when you ask me like we could have like a threetenths variation one way or the other let's check out some more 360 magnet solutions so i'm always moving these off just to make sure that there are designs that i can present all right okay i was getting i was getting a little bit worried because i i was i was what we were like almost 50 minutes into this i think yeah 47 minutes um and we didn't have any of these uh the whole crazy vector animated designs occurring all right so the first issue with this design is this image right here for one it's pixelated it's a photograph so you should never use type baked into photographs like jpegs or pngs or whatever this is meant to be red easily and it's just not working here so if you're going to use a photograph make sure it's of like nontypography things second the type is just really large and it's suffering from a lack of white space and it's really spread out so i would just if you're going to use this this uh design right here or this photograph rather get rid of the type in the image leave this white background here and then just use html to put the the images on top um baking the type into the image or the photograph that's something that we used to do back during the slicing days sometimes you don't want to do that now outside of that this right here the animations completely unnecessary they're they're distracting so i remove that even though it's cool it's just not it serves no purpose outside here the next section yeah you're having issues with alignment because the bottom of this it's wrapping around this image but really this whole left portion should be maintained uh because it's just throwing off the flow of the type you also have quite a bit of type here i'm not sure if everybody or most people will want to read through all this so you might benefit by reducing the amount of type here also the type is a little bit screwed up because you have you have this larger this this one this right here is fine but then you have a smaller type as a sub headline not enough white space but then you have slightly larger type here so things are thrown off like the size of this type should be the size uh of this type or vice versa um and you need more white space like let me show you how easily i could just improve this area in a second so like margin bottom okay that's not working oh it's oh there we go uh margin bottom all right so we've moved moved things away just a little bit and then we also have this element margin top oh what is happening here there we go margin top there so i fixed the white space issues at least with this part but again we have those other issues here that need to be addressed um digital agency services this part's not not too bad actually i've never really been a fan of having embedded youtube videos just because they kind of uh it's hard to make them look good especially like depending on what the thumbnail looks like and also the default ui design for the embedded controls so you might wanna just have a button here that just launches into it perhaps or you can actually i think with the youtube player api you can have your own custom uh splash image and then when people click on it then it will it'll play right inside of their um their ui design all right so what do you think this person should get for a rating by far i mean this stuff is better this page or this sections these are sections right here are better than what's happening up here the biggest issue is this background you have to fix that one being the worst 10 being the best let me know what you all think let's see if it's responsive it is so that's working out at least now i'm going to go ahead and give this one a 4.5 or so seems like most of you are rating it a little bit higher all right let's check out uh let's see how long we've been doing this about eight minutes we probably do um one or two more um so let's continue on um simple website made for learning purposes all right uh let's see here yeah it is definitely on the simple side um and that's okay i usually it's better than than trying to make things complex because we see what that does okay what's interesting is if you go to my youtube channel i just did a video about full screen navigations and i did link a video because it was supposed to be included in this one about the ui in the ux of full screen navigations so if you come to this url definitely check this out because i talk about this sort of thing right here this here don't do that on desktop i because uh there's a few reasons why the main the the primary reason is when you have this hamburger on desktop you're requiring a user to click to access links that would otherwise already fit right here so that's just it's a bad pattern to use of course if we're talking about mobile design you don't have all that physical room to place these links you can do this all right but not when you get out to around here and you have enough space so use and adjust your media queries accordingly outside of that um it's a little bit it's a little bit boring i would say for this this particular illustration um you might want to try to either get a custom one or a rethink or get a different one um i'm not a fan of see i would rather have your your call to action because it's really important that it sticks out be styled like the hover state rather than the default state right here the borders just kind of add a little bit more complexity this makes it more simple but it also stands out more too so i would change that and if you have all this empty space here um you could probably restructure things a little bit more to where this type is larger so we can bump that up to like twice the size no not not twice the size like 6.5 rem units possibly now that's looking a little bit better it's filling things out this then can become larger as well not the same size or anywhere near the same size as this but it can still be larger and then you'll fill out this area a bit more who we are i've pushed this stuff down just a tad bit more more white space beneath this it's a little bit too close to this text area and also when it comes to these photographs or these illustrations you know one way to do it is way you're doing it just put it right there and slap it there but you can also um use it as a background image and make them real large and kind of like offs off it's hard for me to explain but um you can have it so that these are enlarged a lot larger and they can even be cut off to the half of the screen and then coming in naturally it kind of it's a more unique approach um and a more appealing visually appealing approach in my opinion this part looks pretty decent make this bold and maybe a little bit larger more white space between this section and that right here but overall it's pretty good um i probably get rid of the thin borders around these areas you don't need those all right so what do you people think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best i'm going to refresh to see just to show you what it originally looked like and we can see there was definitely an improvement by making that larger it is responsive um i'm gonna go ahead and give this one like a yeah probably like a 6.4 or so 6.5 all right thank you for that submission um we've been streaming for 57 minutes apparently so i'm going to go ahead and give this uh probably we'll do one more one more review let's go ahead and i'll refresh all right starved collection one second i'm checking it out all right so first let's refresh it so you can see what you experience on load so by default we have a we have a um a an embedded youtube player that's starting automatically probably wouldn't do that we could see the at least it is muted by default but there's a more there's more interesting ways you can go about doing something like this you could take this video clip and then um you can make it as a part of like a hero section like a watermark or whatever because again you're not it's being muted anyway um and then also continue to cite huge ux no we don't do that anymore the whole splash page thing um you want to bring them to your site by default already the main site with your user interface so if i click on continue to cite this is what we are presented with which unfortunately there's not much semblance of a user interface here it just looks like we have a navigation up top the logo over here and then we have just kind of like a random band graphic over here with tour dates um so i think there needs to be more of a restructuring you know music sites are fun because they're really unique uh and they're creative and so i would maybe i'll even do a video about maybe just compiling some of the most unique or interesting effective and noneffective banned websites because they like like i said by nature they're usually really cool looking and they're very different they're able to do different things because they're based on a creative industry um but i would like to see like for instance the navigation kind of seems more of an afterthought in this context and we have photographs overlapping each other um and so there's not a strong semblance of a ui here um like merchandise what happens when i click this probably just scrolls there okay yeah it does and if you're gonna have a merch section usually people want to know how much it costs so including that makes sense and maybe scaling down the size of these and putting them in into actual card containers might make sense as well then again um like your music's uh label and in these two things right here they could be left aligned so having them on top you know it makes more sense to put those in two columns rather than just putting one after the other all right uh what do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best remem remember we have this initial page which is a big problem with the uh the whole splash page and requiring people to click here completely just send them right to this page instead but again this has a number of issues that need to be addressed here as well for me i'm just going to go ahead and give this is it responsive i wonder yeah it is i'm going to go ahead and give this a 4.5 or so i think that's pretty fair it seems like most of you agree with me anyhow all right so that here is it so that was the the final stream of the threepart stream series that we've set up with uh free code camp here of course i do this on my own channel uh my own channel is available at youtube.com forward slash design course um i do these like these see here's one i did just four days ago it's the same thing live ui ux review i call it the negative space which is just a play on um ui design fundamental i'm not very that much negative but it's the same exact show that you saw here so if you enjoyed these subscribe to my youtube channel and i do them usually once a week sometimes uh once every two weeks and just do the same exact thing also we're working hard me and my team on getting designcourse.com ready it's going to be months out from now but if you want to be emailed in order to take uh become a member of this service where we're going to have ui tests live workshops challenges and full courses yeah go ahead and just enter your email to be notified when that releases so i want to thank uh quincy larson for having me on i'm definitely interested in doing this again sometime down the road in the future um and yeah this was fun hopefully all learned something here as a part of this check out the other two uh live streams i did here in the prior two weeks if you're more interested in learning as well i will see all of you sometime in the future all right goodbye
