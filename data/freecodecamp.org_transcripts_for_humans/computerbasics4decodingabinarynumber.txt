00:00 - Hi, I'm Briana with freeCodeCamp
00:01 - and today we're going to be talking about the
00:03 - Binary Numeral System,
00:05 - also known as a bunch of 1's and 0's
00:07 - over and over again.
00:09 - We're going to start by labeling, starting backwards,
00:12 - how many numbers there are.
00:14 - This will be zero, one, two, three, four, five, six.
00:19 - Pretty straightforward so far.
00:22 - The next step that we're going to do is:
00:24 - Take two to the power of whatever place it is.
00:28 - So here, it'll be two to the power of zero,
00:30 - two to the power of one,
00:31 - two to the power of two,
00:32 - two to the power of three,
00:33 - you get the picture.
00:35 - Alright, now that we've got the two to the given power
00:38 - figured out all we got to do is
00:40 - fill in some lengths and we'll have our solution.
00:42 - Two to the power of zero is one.
00:45 - Two to the power of one is two.
00:47 - Two to the power of two is four.
00:50 - We've got 8, 16, 32, 64.
00:53 - And that just keeps going on and on.
00:55 - Next what we're going to do is see which ones of
00:58 - these numbers do we keep.
01:00 - So the next step: figure out which numbers do we keep.
01:03 - Do we just add all of these together?
01:04 - And if these were all ones, then yes we would.
01:07 - But some of them are zeros.
01:09 - The zero is the same thing as an off switch.
01:12 - 1 being on, 0 being off.
01:15 - So we can go ahead and cross all of these out right here
01:18 - because they're they're not going to really matter.
01:19 - We want to keep this one, this one here, and here
01:22 - because they have the corresponding 1's
01:25 - which means: Yes! It's on!
01:26 - We want to keep that number.
01:28 - Basically from here on out. We're just going to add these
01:31 - four numbers together. [Adding] Giving us, we've got 72, 74, 75.
01:34 - So this number in binary means 75.
