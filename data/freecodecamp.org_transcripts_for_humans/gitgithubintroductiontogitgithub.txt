00:00 - Hi! I'm Briana from 
freeCodeCamp.
00:02 - Today we are going to be 
talking about Git and GitHub:
00:05 - how you use them, 
when you use them,
00:07 - and some of the differences 
between the two.
00:09 - To start off, 
let's talk about Git.
00:12 - Git is a 
version control software,
00:14 - which means 
while you're coding
00:15 - you can save each little time 
you make a change.
00:18 - So if you 
make a mistake,
00:19 - you want to 
undo something,
00:21 - or you just want 
to look back
00:22 - and see how 
it was before,
00:23 - you can do 
that with Git.
00:25 - Git is also 
open source.
00:27 - You can find 
Git to download
00:29 - at http://git-scm.com
00:31 - they also have 
great resources
00:33 - for documentation.
00:36 - Now let's talk 
about GitHub.
00:37 - You've probably been 
on GitHub before
00:39 - for some 
freeCodeCamp things,
00:41 - noticed it there, 
you probably even have an account.
00:43 - GitHub is a 
collaboration website
00:45 - that interacts with Git 
and works with it
00:48 - on the projects 
that you work on
00:50 - in your 
version control.
00:52 - It's hard to tell 
where the line is
00:54 - between what's Git 
and what's GitHub -
00:57 - that's okay, 
you don't have to know.
00:59 - What you need 
to remember is
01:00 - you'll use GitHub 
to interact with Git.
01:04 - You'll use it 
to collaborate
01:05 - with your peers on projects
using version control.

Hi! I'm Briana from freeCodeCamp. Today we are going to be talking about Git and GitHub how you use them, when you use them, and some of the differences between the two. To start off, let's talk about Git. Git is a version control software, which means while you're coding you can save each little time you make a change. So if you make a mistake, you want to undo something, or you just want to look back and see how it was before, you can do that with Git. Git is also open source. You can find Git to download at http//gitscm.com they also have great resources for documentation. Now let's talk about GitHub. You've probably been on GitHub before for some freeCodeCamp things, noticed it there, you probably even have an account. GitHub is a collaboration website that interacts with Git and works with it on the projects that you work on in your version control. It's hard to tell where the line is between what's Git and what's GitHub that's okay, you don't have to know. What you need to remember is you'll use GitHub to interact with Git. You'll use it to collaborate with your peers on projects using version control.
