00:00 - how to check if a property isn't an
00:02 - object
00:04 - here we have an object just my object
00:06 - name
00:07 - js nuggets that's the property and a lot
00:09 - of people to check if property is an
00:11 - object do this
00:18 - so you can say it's going to say it is
00:19 - in here
00:21 - but there are actually two native ways
00:24 - for checking if an object is in a
00:26 - property that sometimes are better than
00:29 - just saying if object got my name there
00:32 - so let me show you those
00:33 - there's the in operator and there's the
00:37 - has own property function
00:41 - so here's an example of those
00:48 - and if we run both these we can see true
00:51 - and true
00:53 - my object that has on property names
00:55 - going to be true and name in my object
00:58 - so those are the two ways has on
00:59 - property and in
01:02 - however there's something to to keep in
01:04 - mind with these
01:06 - has own property will only return true
01:08 - if the key is available on that object
01:10 - directly
01:11 - however in
01:12 - will show true whether it's created
01:15 - directly on the object or if the
01:16 - property is inherited from the prototype
01:18 - chain
01:19 - let me show you an example of that
01:23 - i'm just going to paste these but i'm
01:25 - gonna put in a different property here
01:31 - so value of is a property on all objects
01:35 - however it's not one that we
01:37 - specifically created on this object
01:41 - value of is just part of the prototype
01:43 - of an object so let's run that and see
01:45 - what happens
01:47 - so you'll see at the end false
01:49 - true
01:50 - so has own property value of is showing
01:53 - false the value of in my object is
01:56 - showing true
01:57 - so those are just a few ways to check if
01:59 - a property's in an object thanks for
