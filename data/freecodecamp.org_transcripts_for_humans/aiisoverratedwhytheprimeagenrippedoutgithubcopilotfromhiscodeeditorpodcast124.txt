00:00 - I mean how much do you feel like you're
00:01 - just like falling back on your instincts
00:02 - that are honed over the years I rarely
00:05 - rarely really
00:08 - [Music]
00:23 - think welcome back to the free Cod Camp
00:26 - podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and
00:28 - founder of free Cod camp c.org each week
00:31 - we're bringing you Insight from
00:33 - developers Founders and ambitious people
00:35 - in Tech this week we are talking with
00:38 - the primagen he is a software engineer
00:41 - he worked at Netflix up until recently
00:44 - for quite a while and now he's focused
00:46 - full-time on streaming live streaming
00:48 - coding on Twitch and on other places and
00:51 - just you know talking about coding
00:54 - showcasing his skills welcome man how's
00:57 - it
00:58 - going it's going well how are are you
01:00 - I'm doing fantastic man it's great to
01:02 - talk to you uh I am a longtime viewer of
01:05 - your YouTube videos like I don't watch
01:08 - Twitch because I like to do everything
01:09 - at Double speed but I've enjoyed some of
01:12 - your takes over the years uh especially
01:14 - on the AI related things
01:17 - yeah okay okay I I feel like I
01:20 - personally have great takes on
01:22 - AI yeah well we're going to talk about
01:24 - some of those first though a lot of the
01:27 - people listening to this may not uh even
01:29 - though you have have a huge audience
01:30 - like right before you were streaming
01:31 - this I I went over to Twitch and I saw
01:33 - that you had like more than a thousand
01:34 - people watching you uh working on some
01:36 - different projects and uh yeah yeah like
01:39 - a lot of people obviously know who you
01:40 - are you're a big deal in the programmer
01:42 - space but uh a lot of people in the free
01:45 - Cod Camp community may not yet know who
01:47 - you are so uh one of the things I like
01:49 - to do whenever I have somebody on is
01:52 - kind of go back and do their programmer
01:54 - origin story uh and kind of get that out
01:56 - of the way before we launch into the
01:58 - many many questions I have prepared for
02:00 - you so yeah maybe you could tell us a
02:02 - little bit about like who you were as a
02:05 - kid and who you looked up
02:07 - to uh as far as looking up to uh I'm
02:11 - going to I I I have a stack brain so I
02:13 - just order I answer things in Reverse so
02:15 - just be prepared for that so if you ask
02:16 - more than one question you will get a
02:17 - reversal uh so as far as people who I
02:20 - looked up to Jim Carrey was probably my
02:22 - number one person that I looked up to uh
02:25 - Jim Carrey was absolutely uh just the
02:28 - coolest as far as like what did I did as
02:30 - a kid you know I I think my biggest
02:32 - claim to fame my biggest accomplishment
02:34 - is when I was somewhere between the ages
02:35 - of three and four I beat Super Mario I
02:37 - was really really into playing NES I
02:40 - just was something that from a very
02:42 - young age just spoke to me I I could not
02:44 - I could in fact beat level uh level
02:48 - three of battle toads the classic one
02:50 - that people can beat the Speeder Bike
02:52 - one yeah the SP the speed yeah the
02:54 - scooters where you jump on there and you
02:55 - go back and forth and you go yeah I
02:57 - could I could beat that at a very young
02:58 - age right when it came out I could beat
02:59 - right away and fun story here I I got
03:02 - all the way up to level seven vul Meers
03:04 - Inferno if I'm not mistaken and I was
03:06 - like oh man that was so hard and I was
03:08 - like five or six years old at that time
03:09 - and I just couldn't beat it and then at
03:11 - 21 years old I bought an NES and I
03:14 - bought battle toades and I'm like I'm
03:16 - older I'm faster I'm Wiser I'm
03:19 - everything here we go got to level eight
03:22 - and I was just like oh my goodness this
03:23 - game is so hard and eventually I got
03:25 - pretty good at it so I could speedrun it
03:27 - I I I was able to beat in about 36
03:28 - minutes I think was
03:30 - beat the entire game in 36 minutes
03:33 - that I mean did you use like the level
03:35 - three warp there's like a special go the
03:37 - way through oh so no wall yeah there's a
03:39 - bunch of walls so on like level level
03:41 - one if you if you headbutt the first two
03:43 - guys you drop down headbutt go to the
03:45 - next one headbutt jump to the next scene
03:46 - you'll go to a level three on level
03:48 - three I think on the 10th gravestone on
03:50 - the very very fast ending part you'll
03:52 - hit a warp to a level five on level five
03:55 - I want to I I want to say there isn't a
03:58 - uh warp you just had to go through and
03:59 - serve but on level six the snake level
04:01 - there's actually one if on the second
04:02 - snake room if you sprint off the moment
04:05 - this the first snake turns and becomes
04:07 - flat you'll actually run through fall
04:09 - through a bunch of Pokey things and not
04:11 - actually hit any of them and land right
04:12 - into a warp interesting you go all the
04:14 - way up to level eight and so level
04:16 - Eight's about as far as as I know where
04:18 - the warps are I've never actually looked
04:19 - up any of these things I just kind of
04:21 - discovered them all as someone who was
04:23 - just trying to get really fast at the
04:24 - game yeah I mean that game is notorious
04:27 - for just its ridiculous difficulty and
04:29 - like the spike and difficulty it was so
04:31 - inconsistent because level one and level
04:32 - two were not that hard then all of a
04:34 - sudden you get to the speed thing and
04:35 - it's just like as a kid I got really
04:37 - frustrated I paid like you know six
04:39 - bucks which back in like 1980s was like
04:42 - 10 bucks 15 bucks uh and uh rented that
04:45 - game and I was like all right I'm gonna
04:47 - have a great weekend I'm gonna beat this
04:48 - game that because I beat every other ANS
04:50 - game that I rented right but no that
04:52 - speed bike thing I I was banging my head
04:54 - against and I can't remember if there
04:55 - even continues in the game but basically
04:57 - you just run out of lives and you're
04:58 - just like damn I have to yeah play level
05:00 - level one Lev there's no continue yeah
05:03 - yeah there's no safe spots there's no
05:04 - continues it's just it's just brutal
05:06 - that's that's how it works yeah they
05:07 - call it NES hard it's like Elden ring
05:09 - just without saving yeah yeah and Elden
05:13 - ring without saving would not be very
05:14 - fun there are people that can beat Elden
05:16 - ring without taking a hit or at least
05:18 - I'm not sure if it's for Elden ring but
05:19 - for the other Souls games yeah I've
05:22 - heard about this these no hit
05:23 - playthroughs of these of the Souls game
05:25 - I've never actually watched one or
05:26 - actually seen anyone do even part of it
05:28 - I never actually got into the souls game
05:29 - until as uh until Elden ring I didn't
05:31 - even know that was a category of games
05:33 - absolutely loved it speaks to my NES
05:35 - loving kind of nature it is a game that
05:37 - is just most certainly something that I
05:39 - love Challenge and difficulty and
05:42 - preciseness because there's something
05:44 - that's really pretty about preciseness
05:47 - you know uh you can't you can't be off
05:49 - by any amount it's just like you it's
05:51 - really like a very constrained way to do
05:53 - something but you can do it really fast
05:55 - which makes it fun yeah yeah I mean like
05:57 - eight frames to Parry uh in a lot of
05:59 - cases or if you have like the little
06:00 - Mitten you can Parry with like slightly
06:02 - more frames uh yeah I love uh I I did
06:06 - play Elder ring my kids love watching me
06:07 - play Elder ring uh but I just got I I
06:11 - couldn't I it took too long to figure
06:13 - out where I was supposed to go I like
06:14 - the Dark Souls 3 is my favorite of the
06:16 - souls games and it's because it's pretty
06:18 - clear where you need to go like the
06:19 - levels are pretty linear and it's all
06:21 - about like just getting from one place
06:23 - to the next and combat I encourage you
06:24 - to go back and try that if you haven't
06:26 - played Dark Souls 3 I've never tried it
06:28 - all I know is I've only played elen ring
06:30 - and when I played Elden ring I really
06:31 - just just had no idea where I was going
06:34 - it is extremely unclear what you have to
06:36 - do yeah and I think this part of they're
06:38 - trying to recreate that like old early
06:41 - computer game kind of like experience of
06:45 - just you know you've got this
06:47 - instruction manual that doesn't help all
06:48 - point is the game itself it's not to win
06:51 - it's to play the game yeah absolutely
06:54 - Dark Souls though uh I'm a huge fan of
06:56 - that series and uh of the designer and
06:59 - everything he's done to revitalize that
07:01 - kind of like Nintendo hard type uh to to
07:05 - frankly respect the audience and yes
07:08 - like it it does become an accessibility
07:10 - issue when you have people who have uh
07:12 - you know like motor uh skill impairments
07:15 - and other things and it's simply just
07:17 - not accessible to those people and he
07:19 - refuses adamantly to add like an easy
07:21 - mode to the game because he feels like
07:22 - that would compromise the Integrity of
07:24 - the game I mean the easy mode to the
07:26 - game is you go and you like Farm a whole
07:28 - bunch of XP and you become like
07:30 - overpowered at a lower level and then
07:32 - you can kind of like skate through some
07:33 - of the early encounters but I I
07:35 - definitely respect that philosophy and
07:37 - that commitment to look this game isn't
07:40 - for
07:41 - everybody yeah so I love it so playing a
07:45 - lot of really hard video games um
07:48 - looking up to Jim krey let's talk about
07:49 - Jim krey for a minute like that guy is
07:52 - super Innovative if you watch like the
07:53 - first Ace Ventura movie like all the
07:56 - different Impressions he's doing uh yeah
08:00 - yeah what was it about him that Drew you
08:02 - to him I don't know I'm just like every
08:04 - other kid I just thought he was
08:05 - hilarious he was fantastic Ace Venture
08:07 - or two when Nature Calls was like my
08:08 - favorite movie uh growing up all that
08:11 - kind of stuff so I know whatever that is
08:14 - it just was a natural thing the mask
08:16 - absolutely fantastic uh Ace furo one was
08:19 - fantastic the the tutu with with him
08:22 - dancing on the or getting freaked out by
08:25 - the bubble ramp like that's just it just
08:26 - it was all so fantastic yeah
08:30 - so you know I want to talk a little bit
08:32 - about your childhood and again I don't
08:34 - want to pry uh you know I came from like
08:37 - a family you know we were middle class
08:40 - and um I didn't have any early tragedies
08:43 - in my family uh but you know I'm trying
08:46 - to like figure out a way to put this but
08:48 - but like you lost your father at a
08:49 - pretty early age and you've talked about
08:52 - how that impacted you uh but could you
08:55 - talk about how that maybe like changed
08:57 - your trajectory like do you ever think
08:58 - of like a m Universe of like what you
09:01 - would be like like if I don't know if
09:03 - you watched Star Trek but like like the
09:05 - tapestry episode where uh Captain peard
09:08 - like sees what his life would have been
09:09 - like if these certain events hadn't
09:11 - happened and he's got this idealized
09:13 - version of his life and then he's got
09:14 - the real life where he ended up being
09:16 - the captain and that's the one that's
09:18 - you know marred with setbacks and bad
09:20 - judgment calls and all these other
09:21 - things that were just part of his
09:23 - exploration uh as a youth like would you
09:27 - would you be cool with talking about
09:28 - that a little bit
09:30 - yeah sure so what what is the specific
09:32 - question sorry there's a lot to it was
09:34 - it is it that I what would my life be
09:36 - like if it
09:38 - hadn't well yeah whether you think about
09:40 - that and you know maybe I do yeah I do
09:45 - do are you ready for an answer that
09:46 - might not be the answer you're ready for
09:48 - I am ready for anything man uh all right
09:50 - so have you ever read the book of the
09:52 - problem of Pain by CS
09:54 - Lewis I'm familiar with CS Lewis and his
09:56 - work uh I haven't read that specific
09:59 - book okay uh it's it's probably his most
10:02 - meaty book if if if meaty is the correct
10:04 - term for books and it in the very
10:06 - beginning it starts off with this idea
10:08 - where there's like there's various
10:11 - canards in in in a life where it's like
10:14 - is God so powerful that he himself can
10:16 - create a rock that he cannot
10:18 - lift right like it's it's it's it's
10:20 - stating a question which it's meant to
10:22 - be something you're supposed to think
10:23 - about blah blah blah blah and so when he
10:27 - talks about that he talks about this
10:28 - idea of impossibility so if something is
10:31 - impossible what it actually what what
10:33 - you're actually saying is that it is
10:34 - impossible suppressed Clause unless and
10:37 - then you change the situation uh meaning
10:40 - that it is impossible for me to see the
10:41 - road where I'm currently at unless if I
10:43 - were to leave the room I'm in and walk
10:45 - outside so that's called an
10:46 - impossibility it is impossible for me to
10:48 - see the road right now and so you have
10:50 - the suppressed Clause an intrinsic
10:51 - impossibility is something in which
10:54 - there is no time space actor or Universe
10:58 - in which The Impossible becomes possible
11:01 - there is no suppressed unlust Clause
11:03 - because it cannot exist and so I do not
11:05 - believe that there is any universe or uh
11:09 - time or situation that could have been
11:12 - conceived in some sense that would have
11:14 - changed the past or for me to understand
11:16 - what that you know what the outcome of
11:17 - that is and so I think of it more like
11:19 - an intrinsic impossibility so I don't
11:21 - actually think about what would my life
11:22 - be like if I were to have cuz it it
11:25 - changes it at such a fundamental level
11:27 - that there's no real point in thinking
11:29 - of it
11:31 - yeah and so that's kind of like my
11:32 - general answer of like what does it mean
11:34 - to have a dad that you know I can only
11:35 - answer in the in the affirmative of what
11:38 - does it mean not to have a dad growing
11:40 - up which you know there's there's a lot
11:41 - of difficulties I'd say uh one of the
11:43 - hardest things that ever came about was
11:47 - when I
11:49 - was I don't know I'd say I'd say it's
11:51 - like maybe 22 23 years old uh I used the
11:55 - term dad for the first time that I could
11:57 - conceivably remember that was strange
12:01 - right that's not a that's not a
12:02 - situation that a lot of people maybe can
12:04 - you know recognize but for me that was a
12:06 - very unusual thing uh I think having
12:08 - kids has allowed me to understand what
12:10 - it's like to have a dad so I don't get a
12:13 - dad but I can understand what it's like
12:14 - to have a dad and I can understand the
12:16 - importance of being a dad but I can
12:17 - never understand what it's like to have
12:19 - one I have no person in which I could
12:22 - feasibly have someone because whether
12:24 - you like it or not a mom is will never
12:25 - be a dad a dad will never be a mom a kid
12:27 - growing up really just needs this kind
12:29 - of dynamic duo uh my mom tried her best
12:31 - she did a great job doing as the best
12:33 - she could do but she could never be my
12:36 - dad and there's just something about
12:38 - that that has always been this like deep
12:40 - desire for me to have that side and I
12:43 - just never ever got it and that I know
12:46 - that it's missing and that's it and so I
12:49 - can't fill it I can just vicariously
12:52 - observe it in my
12:56 - kids yeah so yeah that's that's
12:58 - effectively my my life as growing up
13:01 - without it uh a lot of hard things
13:03 - transpired because of it but you know
13:05 - like I never had someone to tell me uh
13:07 - in in kind of the way I needed to hear
13:08 - it that I was being an
13:11 - idiot you know I never had someone that
13:13 - showed me how to do things in the way
13:16 - that I could I guess understand
13:18 - it yeah were you able to find any other
13:23 - like people in your life like teachers
13:25 - or other people that they could kind of
13:28 - serve even interraction of that
13:31 - role no uh my uncle uh physically abused
13:36 - me my other uncle was in prison so not
13:39 - not necessarily any male side in my life
13:43 - that you know was quality if you will
13:47 - yeah well what got you interested in
13:50 - computers um in terms of like like you
13:53 - got really early on you were you were
13:55 - interested in computer I'm laughing cuz
13:56 - that was just like such an intense 180
13:58 - from where just going uh yeah I'm kind
14:01 - of thinking like like just just to
14:03 - articulate my thinking there cuz yeah
14:05 - I'm not like reading from a list of
14:07 - questions like that that is my NE next
14:09 - logical question because I don't know
14:11 - what else frankly there is to be said uh
14:13 - and you know I don't want to um denature
14:16 - what you just said by oh I'm sure
14:18 - everything worked out anyway and all
14:19 - that you know Jazz I I just want to like
14:23 - be because computers were a big part of
14:25 - your life from a very early on period
14:28 - from what I understand from listening to
14:29 - lots of interviews with you um and uh
14:32 - you know watching your channel and stuff
14:34 - and I mean was that was that an escape
14:38 - or was that just a way of channeling
14:39 - your energy like like cuz I mean it
14:41 - sounds like you grew up in a pretty you
14:44 - know adverse environment like despite
14:47 - the best efforts of your
14:49 - mom I would say that video games were
14:51 - more likely the Escape um Perhaps
14:54 - Perhaps programming in some sense was
14:56 - that as well um I didn't really grow up
14:58 - doing programming or anything like that
15:00 - I really enjoyed trying to install doom
15:02 - and get that done and be able to play
15:03 - Doom that was that was a great time uh
15:05 - there's all these like little things
15:07 - that I didn't quite understand that I
15:08 - just I very much so enjoyed uh about
15:10 - computers when I had a problem I I kept
15:12 - trying to figure it out and it was very
15:14 - frustrating and it'd be very upsetting
15:16 - but that's you know that was just part
15:18 - of part of life we just had a computer
15:20 - we had access to a computer really early
15:21 - on because before my dad passed he was
15:24 - doing a startup uh you know it's irony
15:27 - uh story at some point I'll I'll tell
15:28 - later about my first startup but for
15:31 - whatever reason uh he was just too early
15:33 - to uh to the startup he had you know if
15:36 - you remember 10 10220 dial down the
15:37 - middle I believe or whatever it was
15:39 - called Uh there's some like dial down
15:42 - phone card type longdistance situation
15:45 - he was doing in the late 80s early 90s
15:48 - which was just entirely too early for it
15:51 - to exist really cuz that didn't really
15:53 - come about until just a little bit later
15:54 - maybe like 5 years later that became a
15:56 - real thing people wanted cuz you know
15:59 - phones were a rarity in the late '90s
16:01 - early 2000s they weren't a common nearly
16:03 - as common as they are now yeah and so uh
16:08 - he we we just always had some access to
16:10 - a computer and so I was always able to
16:12 - play around on a computer and I played a
16:14 - lot of Mong tile and freei and all that
16:16 - stuff in Windows 31 you had to start up
16:18 - Doss and then in Doss you had the xq
16:19 - windows to get it to run and all that so
16:22 - had like some basic early experience
16:23 - with computers though I largely didn't
16:25 - understand anything it wasn't until
16:26 - there's this video game called Grail or
16:28 - growl I'm not really sure g r a a
16:30 - l and sorry and with it they had a level
16:35 - editor and I started playing with the
16:36 - level editor and if you double click on
16:37 - an NPC it would actually load up some
16:39 - script like some sort of Grail script I
16:41 - think is what they call it uh NPC script
16:43 - not really sure but it was a c like
16:45 - syntax and so I was able to look at it
16:47 - and effectively figure out what it's
16:48 - trying to say and it's not I mean
16:51 - programming in itself if you're
16:52 - sufficiently motivated is not terribly
16:54 - hard to start figuring out uh if it's a
16:56 - simple enough script like Lua is a
16:58 - pretty simple enough script that I think
17:00 - you could eventually figure out
17:01 - everything about it and so it's it's it
17:04 - was something simpler than Lua very very
17:07 - unexpressive and so you could just I
17:09 - just started looking and understood if
17:11 - if statements and while loops and all
17:13 - that and yeah it was it was fun so
17:15 - that's kind of how that's like my early
17:17 - time into computers and so I just really
17:19 - enjoyed doing that building stuff yeah
17:22 - and L of Warcraft 2 level
17:24 - editor yeah so so you might be just
17:27 - programming kind of incidentally without
17:29 - even realizing you were programming with
17:30 - the higher objective of building a level
17:33 - or making you know NPCs do certain
17:36 - things uh you you kind of learn it in
17:38 - rout to the goal of developing
17:41 - levels is is that like something like
17:44 - that I just wanted to build stuff and so
17:45 - I could see I could build interactive
17:47 - things so I just I just played around
17:48 - and kept trying to build interactive
17:49 - things yeah right
17:51 - on yeah and my understanding is like a
17:54 - lot of people approach you know me and
17:57 - they're like hey does free C Camp have
17:58 - like a Lua course because like that's
18:00 - one of the easier like languages to
18:02 - learn and and like I don't know if it's
18:04 - used in Minecraft uh M Minecraft Roblox
18:07 - like a lot of believe it is used in
18:08 - Minecraft yeah a lot of these uh these
18:11 - games especially like massive online
18:14 - games uh seem to like get serve as a
18:18 - good Gateway for kids to get into
18:20 - programming right um and like I think
18:22 - yeah most most games use Lua because Lua
18:24 - is an incredibly easy embeddable
18:26 - language like even an experienced
18:29 - embeddable person could probably embed
18:31 - Lua uh the language like I've never
18:33 - embedded a single language in my
18:34 - lifetime I could probably do it in an
18:36 - afternoon or
18:37 - two yeah so I think that's why it
18:40 - largely works with a lot of game
18:42 - development and all that is just it's
18:43 - it's really simple like embedding V8
18:45 - extremely difficult that might take me a
18:47 - year embedding Lua might take me a
18:50 - week yeah that's a good endorsement of
18:52 - Lua as like just like an accessible
18:54 - language people can add if they want to
18:56 - get like a community of creators around
18:58 - and when say creators not necessar like
19:00 - YouTube creators but like people just
19:01 - creating levels right um my kids love
19:04 - making Mario Maker levels for example um
19:07 - yeah how I don't want to like get too
19:10 - personal about your your kids but like
19:12 - how old are
19:13 - they uh 10 through three uh my daughter
19:16 - just turned three a couple days ago so 3
19:19 - six uh 8 and 10 yeah so so they're
19:22 - probably in that age like do you allow
19:24 - them to play video games and stuff like
19:25 - a lot like we have a rule that we don't
19:27 - let our games on days but yeah yeah
19:30 - pretty much same thing we don't do uh
19:32 - weekday we try not to do too much they
19:34 - just turn into they turn into little uh
19:37 - I'm not sure what other term to use
19:38 - other than [ __ ] they just like turn
19:40 - they just like it's like when you give
19:41 - them too much sugar it's just
19:43 - emotionally brittle they become very
19:44 - emotionally brittle when you let them
19:45 - play too many video games just like if I
19:47 - veg out and do something and watch too
19:49 - much TV I find everything to be
19:50 - inconvenient it's the same thing except
19:52 - for I just have the emotional
19:54 - wherewithal to kind of you know push
19:56 - through it whereas they're still so
19:58 - young it's just it's very difficult for
20:00 - them to understand what it takes to live
20:02 - a regular life and so if you let them
20:03 - play too many video games obviously
20:05 - things kind of go off the rails and so
20:07 - yeah we we do some weekend time like
20:08 - we'll play fortnite the kids love
20:10 - playing fortnite with me so we'll all
20:11 - load up into fortnite and go run around
20:13 - shoot stuff and since they since it's
20:15 - largely like uh my 10-year-old and my
20:17 - 8-year-old and they're not that very
20:18 - good and you know I can I can play I
20:21 - used to I used to play a lot of fortnite
20:22 - you know and it's like now just a lot of
20:24 - bots are really bad people it'll be like
20:26 - I'll get like 25 kills in a game and I'm
20:28 - just like man this what it feels like to
20:30 - be like a pro fortnite player playing
20:31 - with regular people because it's just
20:33 - like so easy because it's probably all
20:34 - Bots yeah it's fun we like it yeah
20:37 - that's cool so uh video games have been
20:39 - a way for you to like kind of share your
20:41 - childhood passion with your kids it
20:43 - sounds like yeah I really play them
20:46 - though uh just because uh they you know
20:48 - they they became uh I'd say probably
20:51 - like a crutch or a coping mechanism and
20:52 - it's not that I explicitly was like a
20:54 - crutch or coping mechanism it's just
20:55 - that I just recognized uh if I wish to
20:58 - be be really good at programming or
21:00 - really good at anything or do anything
21:02 - in life I just kind of have to make time
21:04 - and most of life is a choice of what you
21:07 - I mean we are fortunate enough to live
21:09 - in a day and age in which there's a huge
21:11 - amount of self-direction and so with
21:13 - that comes the both the joys and the
21:16 - Pains of saying yes to doing something
21:18 - that may not feel as good and saying no
21:20 - to something that feels as good in the
21:22 - moment yeah yeah I mean like I could
21:25 - just sit and spend the weekend on the
21:26 - couch watching Netflix for example
21:28 - example or I can go and like you know
21:30 - compose a new song or I can go uh make
21:33 - it to the gym or you know any number of
21:35 - things that yeah Advance me closer to my
21:37 - goals and yet we we live in an age when
21:40 - like literally every movie every song is
21:43 - like a few clicks away you know reddits
21:45 - an ALT tab way and you're suddenly like
21:47 - seeing interesting half photos and stuff
21:49 - like that so uh yeah like being able to
21:52 - manage yourself has become like a key
21:54 - skill if you want to achieve your goals
21:56 - and like I guess stand out from the
21:58 - other people that have I guess less
22:01 - impulse control I sure if that's like
22:03 - the right way of saying it but yeah I
22:05 - see what you're saying we I constantly
22:06 - say on the stream that uh people misde
22:09 - Define liberty or Freedom quite often
22:11 - which is that Liberty uh is the ability
22:14 - to do what you uh what you want or your
22:17 - higher will and we often we often find
22:19 - especially in our very you know quote
22:21 - unquote free world that we live in that
22:23 - we find we're often just subjugated to
22:25 - our lower will what feels good in the
22:27 - moment will you eat that extra cookie or
22:29 - will you say no because you want to get
22:30 - in shape right like what is which will
22:33 - wins well often you find that the lower
22:35 - will wins much much more than the higher
22:37 - will and so perfect Liberty is the
22:39 - ability to know and say what you want
22:41 - and actually act upon that and so if you
22:43 - want to like say you know you have a
22:44 - large programming audience or a large
22:46 - newer wanting to get into programming
22:47 - audience what is the answer do you say I
22:50 - want to learn programming therefore you
22:51 - learn programming or do you say I want
22:53 - to learn programming like I say I want
22:54 - to learn Chinese which is just like some
22:57 - fictional want that not actually
22:58 - materializes into anything
23:01 - yeah yeah you do you really want to
23:04 - learn Chinese or you just you said just
23:07 - an example I I say I want to learn
23:09 - another language but it's just like the
23:10 - reality is is I'm not going to learn
23:11 - another language you know I say I want
23:14 - to that's it I know I don't I don't I
23:16 - know I don't actually want to we do we
23:18 - do what either our higher or lower will
23:20 - wants us to do and right now all effort
23:23 - and everything is pointed towards either
23:25 - is making what I'm doing right now a
23:27 - success well this isn't like a
23:30 - philosophical podcast so I don't want to
23:32 - delve too deep into this but one
23:34 - question that like I like to ask people
23:36 - sometimes is like whether you think that
23:39 - people actually have
23:41 - potential do people have potential or
23:44 - are people currently realizing their
23:48 - potential can you can you can you say
23:50 - that I I I don't quite know what that
23:52 - means can you can you state in a
23:53 - different way sure so uh for example I I
23:57 - could I could say oh I you know I want
24:00 - to become a really good uh I want to get
24:03 - really good at um let's say like a
24:05 - contemporary language like a rust or
24:07 - something like that and uh oh it'd be
24:09 - great to be a rust player like a rust
24:12 - you know developer and uh oh I know I
24:15 - have kind of a loose idea of what I need
24:17 - to do I just need to sit down and do it
24:18 - so I have the potential to become a
24:20 - great rust developer but am I actually
24:23 - going to invest the time like is that
24:25 - potential actually like a latent
24:27 - property or is it just you know I could
24:30 - be spending my time right now learning
24:32 - rust you know there's a comprehensive
24:35 - rust course on free cooking there's
24:36 - probably lots of other comprehensive
24:38 - interactive rust courses out there that
24:40 - I I could go through and I could I could
24:41 - learn that skill uh do you do you feel
24:44 - like people actually have potential or
24:47 - are is everybody realizing their maximum
24:49 - potential right now unless they change
24:52 - the status quo somehow does that does
24:53 - that make
24:55 - sense I I not 100% I it doesn't make
24:58 - sense to me but I'm going to try to say
24:59 - it in my way and maybe you'll tell me
25:00 - how close I am are people actually
25:02 - living up to what they could live up to
25:05 - now or is it all just Whimsical ideas
25:07 - and we are really not quite being as
25:10 - great as we can yeah like do we just
25:13 - tell ourselves there's the potential
25:14 - there when really like we like the will
25:16 - to act I I apologize I'm doing a bad job
25:19 - of structuring this question but like
25:21 - the question has been posed to me hold
25:22 - on I'm looking up a quote
25:25 - uh let's see uh dang it I know that
25:29 - there's a really really uh give me just
25:31 - one second it's a it's a great quote um
25:33 - all right well I'll hold out for your
25:35 - Zinger here we go I bet you I got this
25:37 - one uh here we go here we go I think
25:39 - this is a pretty good one uh we are
25:41 - half-hearted creatures fooling about
25:43 - with drink and sex and ambition when
25:45 - infinite Joy is offered to us like an
25:46 - ignorant child who wants to go on making
25:48 - mud pies in a slum because he cannot
25:50 - imagine what it is meant by the offer of
25:52 - a holiday at the sea we are far too
25:54 - easily
25:55 - pleased see us Lewis it's a great quote
25:58 - uh effectively how I read this is that
26:00 - we we we settle for significantly
26:02 - significantly less than we can actually
26:04 - achieve I think that that you can you
26:06 - can just you can count how many times in
26:08 - a day that you decided to take the easy
26:11 - dopamine fast route as opposed to uh
26:15 - doing something that's going to actually
26:16 - affect your life in a positive way yeah
26:18 - like how much time is spent scrolling
26:20 - Instagram scrolling Twitter watching
26:22 - just like you know cat videos they don't
26:25 - actually give you anything right there's
26:27 - nothing out of that I know people try to
26:28 - say oh it's how I relax um I somehow
26:32 - doubt that that's really how you relax I
26:33 - think it's just a trained uh mentality
26:35 - cuz I mean you're telling me that all of
26:38 - life and all of humanity never got the
26:40 - chance to relax like my my real thing is
26:43 - is that we've just built up patterns and
26:44 - habits that uh just numb us from the the
26:46 - reality and difficulties of life and we
26:48 - choose that over reality that's I mean I
26:52 - know that's a very intense statement and
26:54 - you said you're not a philosophical
26:55 - podcast but that's that's just kind of
26:57 - my you know just my kind of Take On The
26:59 - World Is that we just settle for we you
27:01 - know it's my I know we're going to get
27:02 - into AI but it's my biggest worry about
27:04 - AI which is AI is there as this infinite
27:07 - teaching well that can help you get from
27:09 - A to B and it is you know theoretically
27:12 - if you have the $40 a month $30 a month
27:14 - whatever it takes to do uh to have chat
27:16 - jity for Omni uh you have the ability to
27:19 - get all these great things and instead
27:23 - you're just going to ask it to solve all
27:24 - your problems you're not going to take
27:26 - the route of becoming some one better
27:29 - you're going to take the route of
27:30 - getting what you need answered you'll
27:32 - become more helpless not more Wise by
27:35 - the end of using
27:38 - AI yeah well we could actually we could
27:41 - absolutely extrapolate that out to other
27:43 - tools like you know Google search as
27:45 - opposed to back in the day knowledge was
27:47 - hard fought you know I'd go to the
27:48 - librarian and I'd have to explain
27:50 - something that librarian who has trained
27:52 - their entire life to to be able to to
27:55 - take my query and like figure out okay
27:58 - what what what is going to help this
28:00 - person and then or maybe sends me over
28:01 - to the doy Decimal System you know card
28:03 - files and I'm I'm looking I'm going
28:05 - through a bunch of old microfilm you
28:07 - know I'm like scouring for the the
28:09 - answer and it's it's hard to get the
28:11 - answer there when you know you can just
28:13 - go on Google and Google like your no
28:15 - matter how half hard your Google query
28:17 - is you are going to get some results
28:18 - right and it's easy to think like oh
28:20 - that was great I solved my problem
28:22 - Google just gave me what I needed right
28:24 - and AI is going to be perhaps even
28:26 - easier to get you know
28:28 - a serviceable solution but that's not
28:30 - really what you needed it's just what
28:32 - you told you yourself that you needed
28:34 - because you didn't want to burn the
28:36 - extra calories to do the extra work you
28:38 - didn't want to invest the extra time in
28:41 - doing like exhaustive
28:43 - research yeah no do you ever hear the
28:46 - story about how unbroken the book was uh
28:50 - written it turned into a movie as well
28:52 - it's the same lady who wrote SE biscuit
28:55 - if I'm not mistaken unbroken I'm not
28:57 - familiar with it
28:58 - it's a very great story about Louis
29:00 - Zamperini a World War II uh veteran who
29:04 - I believe is still alive to this day
29:05 - very very old fell at this point he's
29:07 - like 90 something years old um he got
29:09 - caught in uh Japan flying over the
29:12 - waters and he had to spend quite some
29:14 - time in a Japanese internment camp uh or
29:18 - labor camp or whatever they called it in
29:19 - Japan and uh he also was an Olympic
29:23 - hopeful he was someone that went out
29:25 - there and was I think he ran the 400 or
29:27 - something and he was he was likely
29:29 - slated to win the Olympics when he went
29:32 - and so he had his whole life ahead of
29:34 - him but he joined the military was going
29:36 - to do two years and then boom out comes
29:38 - World War II and all that and the story
29:39 - of the book goes that uh the lady I
29:41 - forget her name um gosh I I literally
29:44 - have no idea what her name is uh she is
29:46 - doing all this research for seab biscuit
29:49 - and she's just reading old newspapers
29:52 - and reading old newspaper she stumbles
29:54 - on this story that's like oh we found
29:56 - Louis Zamperini and we were able to
29:59 - rescue him from one of these Japanese
30:01 - Japanese camps and like that's it and
30:03 - she's like oh that's really interesting
30:05 - put a note on it went back there later
30:08 - ended up spending seven years to write
30:09 - this book it's like you know wild
30:12 - success but if you have the direct
30:15 - answers well this whole story goes to
30:17 - show that if you have the exact A to B
30:19 - there's so much stuff that you miss like
30:22 - the you know often the answer isn't just
30:24 - simply what you want to know it's like
30:27 - that act of Gathering it going through
30:29 - things and yes it's like way inefficient
30:31 - and yes it's not you know like you could
30:33 - certainly move faster if you could just
30:34 - get exactly what you wanted at that
30:36 - exact moment but moving faster isn't
30:38 - like the goal always you know like it
30:41 - can't always be the goal there's more to
30:43 - life than just moving fast
30:45 - yeah 100% and people can delude
30:48 - themselves into thinking oh I'm doing so
30:49 - much you know that's like the whole
30:51 - multitasking thing uh that's uh people
30:54 - like trying to pack their schedule with
30:56 - like tons of conversations like quick
30:59 - 20-minute meetings with like all these
31:00 - different people and I'm sure you're
31:02 - familiar with this having worked in Tech
31:04 - versus like you know a substantial
31:06 - conversation and I would argue that this
31:08 - podcast even though hopefully we'll be
31:10 - able to talk for like 90 minutes or two
31:11 - hours or something like it's really just
31:14 - a a very brief conversation considering
31:17 - like if you consider like a lifelong
31:18 - friendship that you have with somebody
31:20 - and like the things you learn from them
31:22 - over a longer period of time and kind of
31:24 - the ongoing discussions and the ongoing
31:26 - themes the undercurrents in your
31:29 - friendship and and the the things you do
31:31 - together whe whether it's play together
31:32 - in a band whether you're working on a
31:33 - software uh project together in PA
31:35 - programing periodically like whatever it
31:37 - is like greatness takes time right that
31:41 - lady she needed to to spend seven years
31:44 - even after she like filed that note away
31:46 - like actually thoroughly researching it
31:48 - and then writing the book right um yeah
31:52 - and I do think that that is something
31:54 - that we could lose and I know I'm sting
31:56 - like an old man shaking his missed a
31:58 - cloud you know but like really like I do
32:01 - hope we there's a return to form and I
32:03 - hope that there are a lot of people who
32:04 - use these AI tools uh not as crutches
32:06 - but to to further deepen the research
32:10 - rather than just shorten the research
32:13 - process yeah yeah yeah I mean I think
32:17 - it's good I you know like I I realized
32:19 - because I tried to use chat Chad jity 4
32:21 - for a long time to make it do all my
32:23 - python work because I just never liked
32:25 - python I'm not going to lie it's it's
32:26 - it's the true low codes solution is
32:28 - python uh just because you know people
32:30 - who don't like to code tend to code in
32:32 - Python and they are able to just get a
32:34 - lot done without actually becoming you
32:36 - know like full-blown software Engineers
32:38 - they're just like researchers that are
32:39 - just like oh gosh okay done right and so
32:42 - it's like I always looked at python as
32:43 - this language I just never wanted to
32:45 - invest a lot in and so I just tried to
32:48 - always get chat jippy to do it all for
32:49 - me by the way I call it Chad jippy it's
32:51 - just way easier than saying GPT and so
32:53 - jippy way easier and um so it sounds
32:56 - more like Jiminy Cricket or something
32:57 - something like that it sounds like a fun
32:59 - yeah it's just it's fun it's stupid
33:02 - sounding right like the whole point is
33:03 - that it's just dumb sounding and that's
33:04 - funny to me I don't I don't know maybe
33:06 - the Jim Cary days influenced me on this
33:08 - one but
33:09 - uh what I realized is that I was able to
33:13 - make it so far but at the end of the day
33:15 - I learned nothing about python I had
33:17 - nothing to show for my time and I did
33:19 - spend a decent amount of time coaxing it
33:21 - coercing it convincing it begging it to
33:24 - make the right stuff and I just realized
33:27 - that all I was doing was training myself
33:29 - how to provide input to make the AI
33:31 - solve the problem I was solving a
33:33 - problem just a different problem and I
33:35 - realized that if I could have gone back
33:37 - and I could have waved a magic wand I
33:39 - should have asked it how to do those
33:41 - step by step and then programmed it all
33:43 - myself and acquired that little bit of
33:45 - knowledge that would have probably been
33:46 - like three hours worth of work and then
33:48 - I would have been just so much faster I
33:51 - would have been able to move so much
33:52 - quicker and that would have probably
33:54 - paid out tfold but instead it paid out
33:56 - zero fold cuz I IED on it to solve my
34:00 - problems didn't use it as a platform of
34:01 - research yeah I mean like people who I
34:04 - guess get really good with tools but
34:06 - lack the fundamentals they're always
34:08 - kind of you
34:10 - know they can't ever really get leverage
34:12 - and like scale their output they're
34:14 - they're kind of limited by the I guess
34:17 - throughput of those tools and what those
34:19 - tools can do um and that's that's why
34:22 - like we we encourage people to really
34:25 - dive deep into the fundamentals and
34:26 - really learn math computer science
34:28 - Concepts you know take time to read
34:31 - Donald K and stuff like that if that's
34:33 - how you pronounce his last name and and
34:35 - you know I hope that doesn't sound too
34:37 - like uh High flute and heavy-handed like
34:40 - like you got to really put in your time
34:43 - uh but people are in a rush they've been
34:44 - told by the marketers like hey learn a
34:46 - code in nine weeks get a get a Fang job
34:50 - you know pay off your student debt from
34:51 - your degree that didn't you know help
34:53 - you pay off your student debt right and
34:56 - uh I guess I'm grateful that like there
34:59 - is kind of this Back to Basics movement
35:01 - and you're out there preaching uh for
35:04 - lack of a better word like it
35:06 - encouraging people to strengthen their
35:07 - fundamentals and you're introspecting
35:09 - you're talking about this experience
35:10 - that you had with uh you know using jid
35:13 - 4 uh to uh to be able
35:16 - to basically kind of like shortcut
35:19 - actually having to learn and put in the
35:21 - hard work and that you saw that darkness
35:23 - in yourself you saw that that
35:24 - anti-pattern like emerging
35:27 - do you think
35:29 - that do you think that everybody uh like
35:33 - like What proportion of people do you
35:34 - think Will Will just cave to that like
35:36 - do you think everybody has the capacity
35:37 - to step back and think like gee like I
35:40 - just took a bunch of shortcuts and and
35:42 - to introspect well enough that they
35:43 - realized that they didn't actually write
35:45 - that code that all they did was do a
35:47 - series of like naive prompts and GPT 4
35:49 - was smart enough to kind of like fill in
35:51 - the
35:53 - blanks I I think people will always
35:55 - optimize to I in our society maybe maybe
35:58 - there's there exist different Societies
36:00 - in which you know I'm not a I'm not a
36:01 - cultural narcissist I do not believe
36:03 - that everyone behaves like we do and so
36:05 - I'm speaking from a very American
36:06 - perspective maybe broader you could
36:08 - broaden it out to the West perspective
36:10 - but that we will always do what is most
36:14 - efficient generally speaking so if I
36:16 - took a 100 people and I said hey you
36:19 - could a learn all these things solve the
36:21 - problem it'll take you one week or B hey
36:23 - you could prompt and you know get far
36:26 - enough and you could be done in two
36:27 - hours
36:28 - and you had a job and you had things to
36:29 - do and you had people to answer to you
36:31 - you just go okay well I just want to I
36:32 - just want to move on not that you
36:34 - actually you know you don't get the
36:36 - dividends you just get the paycheck and
36:39 - so I think we often trade dividends for
36:41 - paychecks and I I I've been trying to
36:43 - you know if you will the Renaissance of
36:44 - becoming a more learned man uh trying to
36:47 - slow things down and try to adopt a
36:49 - different culture which is that you know
36:51 - you you want to become the master of
36:53 - your craft I love I love those stories
36:54 - of these like that one dude from Norway
36:57 - who could roll steel so well that we it
37:01 - took us all the way until we had our
37:02 - fantastic Technologies just to be able
37:04 - to understand how he built these swords
37:06 - that were like unbreakable it's just
37:08 - like you know how he got that good he
37:10 - probably had some freak genetic gift but
37:12 - he also spent like 30 years making
37:15 - swords to the point where he could flick
37:17 - it listen to The Ring of it and be like
37:18 - this one's bad you like just like just
37:21 - understand deep down it's just such a
37:22 - hidden knowledge secret secret knowledge
37:24 - level like how to do things at just this
37:26 - beautiful level and like I want that I
37:29 - want that I I want the craft you know I
37:31 - want the craft for the sake of the craft
37:33 - I don't want the craft just to just to
37:35 - Simply have output because at the end of
37:36 - the day output works and it's great and
37:39 - I would say that output is much more
37:41 - entertaining slash driving for younger
37:43 - people I think when I was younger output
37:45 - was way more Chief the concern than the
37:47 - craft itself and as I've gotten older I
37:50 - find I find myself realizing that you
37:52 - know life is is just it has to be more
37:55 - than just productivity you know
37:58 - I want to wake up every day and even if
38:00 - I work on the worst things I want to
38:02 - enjoy it yeah yeah I mean like what you
38:06 - just said since we were talking about
38:08 - NES and like you know speedrunning and
38:10 - things like that your ability to
38:11 - speedrun battle toades in like 36
38:13 - minutes there was this guy and you may
38:15 - already be familiar with this but there
38:16 - was this guy who would speedrun all
38:20 - these games back before speedrunning was
38:21 - really even a thing he submitted times
38:23 - and everything his name was Matt Turk
38:25 - and uh have you heard of this guy he had
38:28 - like records feel like I did watch the
38:29 - recent like big speed running thing of
38:31 - the origins of all the speedr running
38:33 - with Games Done Quick and all that I
38:34 - feel like that name was mentioned but
38:36 - I'm trying to like place it where it was
38:38 - it took people years to reproduce like
38:41 - deliberate like like speedrunners didn't
38:43 - understand how he was able to get these
38:44 - times but they eventually were able to
38:45 - like kind of reverse engineering he just
38:47 - got it and then he moved on to the next
38:48 - one and he was just obsessed with the
38:50 - craft he didn't even really care that
38:51 - much about the street credit or anything
38:52 - like that there's no Street credit to be
38:54 - gained I don't think he even like filmed
38:56 - his attempts or anything there was just
38:57 - a culture of like that seems like a
38:59 - really fast time but I guess it's
39:01 - realistic and then years later people
39:02 - were able to like gradually beat it but
39:04 - he he had so many records stand for so
39:06 - long and it was probably some freak
39:08 - combination of like natural aptitude and
39:11 - ability maybe he just had superhuman
39:13 - like uh attention to detail some sort of
39:16 - weird thick genetic cord down his spine
39:19 - that just like allowed super fast you
39:20 - know electricity flow yeah but but it's
39:24 - it's it's kind of the same thing it's
39:25 - like I I don't know if that even knows
39:28 - that people know who he is or care you
39:29 - know but he's just some Forum user from
39:32 - like you know 2006 or something like
39:33 - that playing Nintendo games that nobody
39:35 - even plays anymore back in back at that
39:36 - time uh and uh just the Romanticism like
39:41 - like it's very romantic the notion that
39:43 - this guy's just sitting there probably
39:44 - you know in the proverbial mom's
39:46 - basement like just getting really good
39:48 - at these games and like totally
39:49 - underappreciated but he appreciates
39:51 - himself he appreciates that he is
39:54 - getting these ridiculous times even
39:55 - though he's not even competing with
39:56 - anybody at this time cuz he's so far
39:58 - beyond the competition he's still
40:00 - competing with himself he's trying to
40:02 - like one up himself with each attempt
40:05 - and uh there's something really I don't
40:07 - know like like for me as you know a man
40:10 - and as somebody who like uh takes pride
40:13 - and what they do like there's something
40:15 - very romantic about that so yeah I used
40:17 - to do a a speedrun myself in Mario Kart
40:20 - the original one with Yoshi on Rainbow
40:22 - Road I don't remember my exact times but
40:25 - I know that I could hit every single
40:26 - corner I would drift across every single
40:29 - like it was perfect and we're drifting
40:31 - didn't give you a boost this is the OG I
40:33 - could play the entire thing perfect
40:35 - every single time and I forget the exact
40:37 - timings I was but it was just like
40:39 - awesome and I just loved it and I'd
40:41 - never fall off an edge it was just this
40:42 - idea of just doing the thing so well and
40:44 - then that one time you got lucky and you
40:47 - got a mushroom and on the back side of
40:49 - rainbow road you could hit the mushroom
40:50 - and take the jump across the entire
40:52 - Chasm it was just like that one run was
40:55 - just so much faster than all the rest
40:57 - the runs and it was just so cool but you
40:59 - had to get in all the other runs and
41:01 - like you know play the the you know
41:03 - random number generator game until you
41:05 - until you got in the position and you
41:07 - had to get your skills into the position
41:08 - to where you wouldn't choke the moment
41:10 - you got that mushroom and you would
41:12 - actually finish the run I choked many
41:13 - times because it was so exciting like I
41:15 - was like you know yeah well just keeping
41:19 - with like our general theme of
41:20 - chronology and uh like just to establish
41:23 - the primin origin story like so let's
41:26 - talk a little bit about like high school
41:27 - and college and like because you did
41:29 - ultimately go and study computer science
41:32 - and uh but when you went into like was
41:37 - your like high school guidance counselor
41:39 - like were people like yes this man is
41:40 - going to be a software engineer like
41:41 - what what did people think about you
41:42 - when you were in high school what what
41:44 - was your general vibe
41:48 - off well my teachers all but uh a couple
41:52 - very few um I think of Mr Patrick all
41:54 - the time if somehow Mr Patrick from
41:56 - Billings West High ever heard this a
41:58 - shout out to Mr Patrick great guy and if
42:00 - you know anyone in Billings you tell
42:02 - them to tell Mr Patrick if he's still
42:03 - around uh that he's the best but all the
42:06 - rest of the teachers um you know I was I
42:08 - was I probably wasn't the best student
42:11 - okay you know I there's this one teacher
42:13 - named Mrs be and she had 200 bears in
42:15 - her room and I may or may not have
42:17 - thrown one of or two of the Bears out
42:19 - the window you know I may or may not
42:21 - have gotten in in some decent trouble
42:22 - she handw wrote me a note telling uh
42:24 - telling me that I will never amount to
42:26 - anything in my life she literally like
42:28 - handw wrote you a not saying that the
42:31 - she she she took the time she took the
42:34 - the the time and the effort and the
42:35 - patience to really remind me that I am
42:38 - by far the worst person in the universe
42:40 - and so you know I was I was a shitthead
42:43 - granted I don't know if cursing is
42:44 - allowed on this I was a poop head I
42:46 - don't censor anything don't worry about
42:48 - it okay okay and so I I I agree I I I
42:52 - was not very nice uh but you know I wish
42:55 - I it would it would have more positive
42:57 - teacher been good for me maybe not you
42:59 - know maybe that was just what I needed I
43:00 - never hold on to things negatively and
43:02 - use that as motivation you know you hear
43:03 - Michael Jordan talking about that that
43:05 - he'd intentionally pick a fight with
43:06 - someone else on the opposite team
43:08 - because he needed that drive I don't I
43:10 - don't want to win because I can beat
43:11 - somebody else I want to win because I
43:12 - can be better than I am at this current
43:14 - moment right again the ghost running uh
43:16 - Super Mario uh go-kart all that kind of
43:19 - stuff it's the Perpetual drive to win
43:21 - perfectionism maybe is the right term
43:23 - for it um and so yeah like high school I
43:25 - was definitely a disaster for sure
43:27 - uh College it extended into that
43:29 - disaster just worse and it took me three
43:32 - tries to get through college the third
43:34 - try is when I really took off you a lot
43:35 - of people put it into perspective um in
43:39 - my third try in college I had uh for
43:44 - calculus 4 differential equations
43:45 - usually we just call the calc 4 or
43:48 - dyq I had the highest grade on the final
43:52 - and I was the also the only student to
43:54 - finish the final and there was over 400
43:55 - students
43:57 - so I think that was pretty good uh for
43:59 - Cal 2 I was the only I finished it in 30
44:02 - minutes out of a two-hour final and for
44:04 - Cal 1 it was like 20 minutes and I
44:05 - finished it I had a friend come up and
44:07 - said you finished it so fast that
44:09 - someone thought you just quit and then I
44:11 - also got the highest grades out of all
44:12 - those and so I was like really really
44:14 - good at math but what people don't know
44:17 - is that before that I failed pre-cal
44:19 - three times and I went to the learn the
44:22 - Learning Center 4 hours a day for
44:24 - calculus
44:25 - one and it's just like that's the part
44:28 - that people don't recognize is that um I
44:31 - didn't get good or any of these things
44:34 - by uh it wasn't a natural born Talent or
44:36 - anything so going through high school
44:38 - and going through college it was a huge
44:40 - fight against myself I largely I was my
44:42 - own personal worst enemy for sure for a
44:45 - huge amount of it uh and I had a million
44:48 - and a half excuses everyone has an
44:49 - excuse I mean there's people that have
44:50 - worse lives than me there's people that
44:51 - have better lives than me but we all
44:52 - feel you know pain relatively we all
44:55 - have excuses for why it's unfair or
44:57 - uneven or you know any of those things
44:59 - but it's just like until I let go of all
45:02 - those things and just really went after
45:03 - it I was just such a disaster when it
45:05 - comes to all these things when you say
45:07 - let go of all these things like can you
45:09 - elaborate on that like like what were
45:11 - you like the the kind of Angry Young Man
45:13 - chip on his shoulder kind of like that
45:15 - that kind of archetype that you see when
45:18 - you see like the the cop dramas and
45:19 - stuff like that like were you were you
45:21 - like cuz cuz I was absolutely never been
45:24 - me okay so you weren't
45:27 - it was more just like I didn't care okay
45:29 - so it was apathy it was like you like
45:32 - nihilistic or like what was going
45:34 - on I you know like I was I was a drug
45:37 - addict that wasn't a drug addict yet
45:40 - right I I just wanted to feel
45:42 - something uh and it and and and school
45:45 - was not it right long-term the dividend
45:48 - play was never it so I'd much rather
45:50 - have drank or chased girls or smoked pot
45:53 - done something like that does anything
45:54 - to like try to feel something
45:59 - largely into porn I saw porn for the
46:00 - first time when I was four years old and
46:02 - so that was always been a huge struggle
46:03 - for a large portion of my life I haven't
46:05 - looked at porn in 15 plus years 18 years
46:08 - I have no idea how long but it's been a
46:09 - long long time yeah and and so in this
46:13 - you because you didn't feel anything
46:15 - like again I'm not like a therapist or a
46:17 - psychiatrist or anything like that but
46:18 - I'm just trying to make sense of this
46:20 - like uh as as like we can RI I don't
46:22 - hold you to Scientific standards don't
46:23 - worry Okay cool so so I mean were you
46:27 - just kind of apathetic as far as like
46:29 - academics and stuff you're just like H I
46:31 - kind of suck at math whatever like were
46:32 - you resigned to just sucking at
46:35 - math no it's not that I was resigned
46:37 - sucking at math I was just resigned to
46:38 - not
46:39 - try yeah and so what changed what was it
46:42 - the snap because you put in the time
46:44 - right you went to the Learning Center
46:46 - which is kind of a humiliating thing
46:47 - like I'm not good enough at this I have
46:50 - to ask for help right like like what was
46:52 - it that I guess inspired did did the
46:54 - school compel you to go to the learn
46:57 - Center for like 4 hours a day and get
46:59 - tutor I mean that's a lot of resources
47:01 - you know math tutors like like having
47:03 - somebody teach you oneon-one was it
47:04 - one-on-one
47:06 - instruction one-on-one or one on two
47:08 - yeah there's always a math there's
47:09 - always open seats at a math learning
47:11 - center very few people ever take
47:12 - advantage of it ntas are required like
47:14 - people get their college paid for by
47:16 - volunteering or spending all their time
47:17 - it's not really volunteering if you're
47:19 - getting paid to do it or your college
47:20 - paid for they they they make that
47:22 - trade-off they pay their time for uh for
47:25 - being able to go to college or get their
47:26 - masters or get doctorates and so there's
47:28 - always was seats available so I always
47:30 - had there was never like me waiting for
47:32 - somebody um and so it was just it was
47:35 - just that I just had to put in the time
47:36 - as far as the things that kind of uh
47:38 - like transpired to that it was it was my
47:40 - second go round of college and I became
47:43 - a late Life Christian and I kind of
47:45 - changed like my whole life changed on a
47:47 - dime on a single evening uh never really
47:49 - had any of that um wasn't planning on
47:52 - having any of that and unlike all these
47:54 - fancy stories where people say how their
47:55 - whole life changed and all that the only
47:57 - thing I gained was a conscious and all
47:59 - of a sudden I
48:00 - couldn't like I couldn't do things that
48:02 - I used to do so I if I watched porn I
48:05 - felt bad about it never felt bad in my
48:07 - lifetime all sudden I feel bad about it
48:08 - if I smoked pot I felt bad about it if I
48:10 - drank I felt bad about it I was like
48:12 - what is going on with my life and so
48:14 - it's just like just everything changed
48:16 - and so then it's just like me I I was
48:19 - the most reluctant person becoming a
48:21 - normal contributing citizen I think of
48:23 - all
48:24 - time it's just like I it just every
48:27 - single step of the way I hated it and
48:28 - it's was just like oh man absolutely
48:30 - just the worst just teeth pulling the
48:33 - whole way yeah can you talk about that
48:36 - like that moment of like just hearing a
48:38 - conscious like was it like a voice in
48:40 - your head or was it just a vibe in your
48:41 - gut like I shouldn't be doing this yeah
48:44 - more vibe in the gut probably than
48:45 - anything else you know however that
48:46 - happens where I you know I don't I don't
48:48 - pretend to know any of these things
48:50 - because obviously it's not like I was a
48:51 - well researched person I wasn't I wasn't
48:53 - you know this was not an intellectual
48:55 - exercise that led me to a be this was a
48:58 - very sharp moment that I just felt like
49:00 - uh the the reality of all decisions I've
49:02 - ever made compounded plus like the
49:04 - reality of all future decisions I will
49:07 - make if you were to travel back to that
49:09 - moment you remember the specific Moment
49:11 - Like were you just sitting on the couch
49:12 - like and it just hit you or you know
49:15 - it's a largely it's a personal moment
49:16 - I'm going to I'll keep that to me but it
49:19 - was just yeah it was just it was just a
49:22 - very intense thing and that's all I
49:24 - remember is just being so
49:27 - um compelled to do something that's it
49:30 - like that's why I just say like holy cow
49:32 - is this is this what Experiencing God is
49:34 - like I have no idea because it was
49:35 - vastly like if my realm of experience
49:37 - was this circle it was somewhere way far
49:39 - out on the outside so I was like this is
49:41 - vastly different than all things in my
49:42 - entire lifetime and so therefore I'm
49:44 - going to have to I I it would be a fool
49:47 - of me not to respond and So I responded
49:49 - right and that's that was what led me
49:51 - down the path of being changed where I
49:54 - was fine doing work it's like all a
49:55 - sudden it also unlocked one thing I
49:57 - could I could learn I could I could now
49:59 - not look at school as a complete
50:02 - disaster yeah and what happened from
50:05 - there I mean it sounds like you like
50:07 - frankly it sounds like you were a new
50:08 - man like like it had a dramatic Sudden
50:11 - Impact on your academics on how you
50:14 - manage your time on how you managed your
50:16 - own behavior and like impulses and
50:18 - things like
50:20 - that yeah it it took a long time for me
50:22 - to catch up you know like often I think
50:24 - we all experience this where our heart
50:27 - will move but our actions aren't
50:30 - representing how we feel like I think
50:32 - we've all had these kind of things where
50:33 - you know like take any person that's not
50:35 - in shape but they've all of a sudden
50:37 - they really want to get in shape like
50:38 - their heart has moved and they now feel
50:41 - bad because they know that they didn't
50:43 - do what they thought they should have
50:44 - done right like and so that's kind of
50:45 - like what happened in my life and this
50:47 - this distance took three years for it to
50:50 - close and so it was a long time but it
50:53 - was just like I knew that I didn't like
50:55 - where I was
50:57 - yeah so so like that's I didn't want I
50:58 - didn't want to be addicted to porn or
51:00 - drugs or any of those things like I
51:01 - wanted a life that was meaningful and
51:03 - good and I could actually you know I I
51:06 - could actually one day have a wife and
51:08 - kids and and not give them the same
51:10 - curse that I was given at a young age
51:12 - like how do how do I how do I give
51:14 - something better than what I
51:16 - had
51:19 - yeah and you know to fast forward a
51:22 - little bit you like you have a wife and
51:25 - kids uh you have been able to to find
51:28 - success and it doesn't sound like much
51:30 - of this would have materialized if you
51:32 - just stayed doing what you were doing
51:35 - uh do you ever think about like how like
51:39 - if you could I often I often think like
51:40 - like I I had some pretty dire times like
51:43 - I had a big falling out with my parents
51:45 - I spent like a year sleeping in my car
51:47 - at the Walmart where you can fun fact
51:50 - you yeah Walmart will generally not call
51:52 - the cops on you if you're sleeping in
51:53 - their parking lot they they have kind of
51:54 - like a unspoken rule that
51:57 - you know PE people who are between
51:59 - places to live can like sleep in their
52:01 - car there um and you know hospitals and
52:03 - other places like that are generally
52:04 - pretty understanding so yeah like like I
52:07 - kind of went through a period like that
52:08 - too where I you know dropped out of high
52:10 - school and just spent like a my entire
52:13 - teenage time doing a lot of things that
52:15 - I'm not like super proud of not it's not
52:17 - that I'm not proud of them but it was
52:18 - just like looking back I just I feel
52:21 - guilty that I squandered so much of that
52:22 - time and energy that I could have spent
52:25 - you know reading or learning um and
52:28 - eventually I was able to you know go to
52:30 - state school and and get my degree and
52:32 - everything like that but I always felt
52:34 - like that there there was the Lost Years
52:36 - so to speak um and I always wish that
52:40 - like have you I talked about Star Trek
52:41 - earlier I'm going to talk about it now
52:42 - there's this one episode of start Trek
52:44 - the Next Generation where they're
52:45 - trapped in like a Mobius like a loop of
52:48 - time and uh data and Captain rer figure
52:51 - out this way that they can communicate
52:52 - and send information back to themselves
52:54 - so that they can change some sort of
52:56 - like thing because the ship's going to
52:57 - blow up if they don't do something
52:59 - different than what they've been doing
53:00 - over and over the ship I saw that I saw
53:03 - all the episodes but I can't remember
53:05 - that many of them but I I feel like I
53:06 - remember that one there's another movie
53:07 - called arc on Netflix that is
53:09 - effectively the same thing okay cool and
53:11 - and so anyway they figure out this way
53:12 - that they can like basically use you
53:14 - know Tech as the writers refer to it
53:17 - like neutrinos or something like that
53:19 - that they could send like a few bits of
53:21 - information back and all they could do
53:23 - was send they sent like something in
53:25 - data is like you know AI powered mind
53:28 - like he could actually perceive these
53:30 - and it would like flip a bit or
53:32 - something like that and he would be
53:33 - aware of it and they could only send
53:35 - like I think he sent back like the
53:37 - number three or something like that
53:39 - right um and that's it so again I don't
53:41 - want to spoil this episode but I often
53:43 - wish that I could send something back to
53:45 - myself when I was sleeping in my car at
53:47 - Walmart just like if I could just send
53:49 - back two letters or something so that I
53:50 - could have some sort of Hope because I
53:52 - felt really hopeless I felt really
53:53 - nihilistic I genuinely didn't think that
53:55 - I would live
53:57 - into my 20s I just figured like a lot of
53:58 - my friends died you know like suicide uh
54:02 - other things like that and I just didn't
54:03 - see a feature for myself and I wish that
54:05 - I could send back the letters okay or
54:08 - something like that just to just so I
54:10 - would be like oh there's hope for me you
54:12 - know did you feel any sort of hope uh
54:15 - and and do you wish you could send hope
54:16 - back or do you think that if you sent
54:18 - hope back that would corrupt you somehow
54:19 - and like potentially ruin the process
54:22 - like would you would you trade what you
54:24 - went through um
54:28 - I would never trade what I went through
54:30 - I hold no
54:31 - resentment uh towards anyone or anything
54:34 - um no I would never I would never trade
54:36 - what I had because if I would have
54:38 - traded what what I had I have you know
54:40 - again I I if I could make myself feel
54:44 - better I would have not probably had the
54:47 - same life change event I would have
54:49 - artificially felt better about myself
54:51 - that would not have CED anything that
54:54 - would not have changed anything
54:55 - fundamentally with in me like it took a
54:58 - hard time to make a different
55:01 - person and like there's that there's
55:03 - that old phrase right it goes something
55:05 - along the lines of like hard times make
55:07 - good men good men make easy times easy
55:10 - times make bad men bad men make hard
55:11 - times some some some I forget it's an
55:13 - old phrase it goes something along those
55:15 - lines it's just like I had to have that
55:17 - same internal small cycle where it's
55:19 - like in if I didn't have the bad I don't
55:22 - think I could have had the good yeah
55:27 - awesome well um you know it's it's like
55:29 - the uh you know you always see these
55:31 - like there's there's a lot of these
55:33 - stories that exist where the person that
55:36 - was the the ultimate bad guy whatever it
55:38 - was they're doing something and they're
55:40 - fighting you know the the good guy this
55:42 - happens in chess as well you give up
55:45 - something that looks so high value in
55:47 - the moment but you win in the end
55:49 - because you're able like the person
55:51 - doesn't realize that though they're
55:53 - making the most winning best move in the
55:55 - moment like the thing that they're
55:57 - losing is actually the game and so like
55:58 - it's that greater thing where it's just
56:00 - like I wouldn't want to do that cuz I
56:02 - don't know how the chess pieces would
56:03 - have fallen out to make that better to
56:05 - make a better analogy there which is
56:07 - like I I'm glad that I had to give up
56:09 - the queen yeah yeah like Bobby Fisher
56:11 - sacrificing like almost all his pieces
56:14 - in order to like is that the immortal
56:15 - game yeah I think it's the The Immortal
56:17 - game I think refers to a different game
56:19 - but it it okay it's like they lose every
56:21 - last piece except for two and then win
56:23 - the game like the greatest the greatest
56:25 - bamboozling of all time yeah but it's
56:27 - just like like seeing that line and
56:30 - committing to it and being willing to go
56:33 - through all that pain for what you
56:35 - believe is a good outcome cuz I mean you
56:39 - your judgment could be wrong or your
56:40 - opponent could do something that is like
56:42 - maybe they see that oh he keeps
56:44 - sacrificing high value pieces he's
56:46 - trying to bait me into something but but
56:48 - like can you maybe they're not as greedy
56:50 - as you think they are um but um yeah I
56:54 - see what you're I see what you're saying
56:56 - um and I I think sacrifice let's let's
56:59 - talk a little bit about sacrifice CU you
57:01 - put a ton of time and energy into your
57:03 - skills over the years um you've put a
57:06 - ton of time and energy into optimizing
57:08 - different aspects of you know just being
57:11 - a developer uh and and we can geek out
57:13 - on a lot of the different tools and
57:15 - techniques you use and things like that
57:16 - and I would love to do that if you if
57:18 - you are interested in talking about that
57:20 - yeah but like well first I got to I got
57:22 - to do the philosophical side of why yeah
57:24 - working hard and all these things are
57:26 - good so you hear this phrase a lot which
57:29 - is work smart not hard and so this is
57:32 - where I call absolute [ __ ] on that
57:33 - phrase because when you don't know what
57:36 - smart is there's only one way to get it
57:39 - which is by working hard and so the
57:42 - smart way to work when you don't know
57:43 - what you're doing is to work hard
57:46 - because there you know if let's just say
57:48 - that it's going to take you roughly
57:50 - 10,000 hours of good focused time to
57:52 - become great at programming and after
57:54 - you've worked say x amount of hour
57:56 - your focus time kind of reduces by 10
57:58 - 15% some some amount that you're just
58:00 - not as good you're still getting closer
58:03 - every hour that you're you're you're
58:04 - putting effort and time into and you
58:06 - know if someone's working say 80 hours a
58:08 - week and someone's working 40 hours a
58:10 - week and you compare them in two years
58:11 - like I would take the BET blindfolded
58:14 - and spun around in circles every single
58:15 - time that the person that did 80 hours
58:17 - is in a significantly different position
58:19 - than the person that did 40 hours like
58:20 - it doesn't matter how smart that 40 hour
58:22 - person worked it's just sometimes time
58:25 - wins every time time like that's that
58:27 - was that was a very 60% of the time it
58:29 - wins every time phrase but it was like
58:30 - time wins time wins every time right the
58:33 - person that's just willing to do the
58:34 - most will always win that's why you see
58:35 - the stories about like Kobe Kobe was the
58:37 - first person in the gym last person out
58:39 - of the gym you're telling me that there
58:40 - wasn't times he didn't feel it didn't
58:41 - want to do it it was too ouchy things
58:43 - were hurting probably should have taken
58:45 - a break no it's just that laser focus to
58:47 - do something great but not everybody
58:48 - needs to be Kobe not everybody wants to
58:50 - be Kobe and that's okay you first
58:51 - determine where you want to be and then
58:53 - you set in motion the steps you need to
58:55 - take to get to that position and if
58:57 - Kobe's the goal be the first person in
58:59 - be the last person out yeah if Kobe's
59:02 - not the goal then you know adjust
59:05 - accordingly and that's something I'd
59:06 - also like to talk with you about because
59:08 - freeo camp like I worked I mean there
59:11 - were probably literally weeks uh where I
59:13 - was working like more than 100 hours uh
59:15 - maybe even like 120 hours early on
59:18 - trying to get this open source project
59:19 - off the ground and stuff and uh of
59:22 - course like you in my humble opinion
59:24 - it's bad management to expect your
59:26 - charges to do that like I absolutely
59:29 - advocate for I'm on your team 100% with
59:31 - that but as a founder or as somebody
59:34 - who's trying to like I mean you could be
59:36 - considered a founder of the primagen
59:38 - like Persona the the stream like
59:40 - everything you've built right like that
59:42 - took probably an incredible amount of
59:44 - work it sounds like uh I
59:46 - mean where do you kind of draw the line
59:49 - like between believing that work life
59:50 - balance is important and yet seeing that
59:52 - your own
59:54 - success probably would not have happened
59:56 - if you were trying to work life balance
59:58 - your way or do you believe that do you
60:00 - believe that you could have gotten where
60:01 - you were if you
60:03 - didn't I call it the TRU like because I
60:05 - don't like the term gatekeeping I don't
60:06 - know if you've ever heard any of my
60:07 - rants about it 90 99% of what people say
60:10 - is gatekeeping isn't gatekeeping it's
60:12 - just someone being mean on the internet
60:13 - but I'd say one of the most actual
60:15 - gatekeeping things you can ever see are
60:17 - these people who've achieved a lot in
60:19 - programming and they achieved it VI via
60:21 - like working to death and doing these
60:23 - things tell everybody how important work
60:26 - life balances and that you shouldn't do
60:27 - that and don't do that what they've done
60:29 - is they've sold you a bill of goods that
60:30 - they themselves didn't follow and they
60:32 - themselves didn't use to achieve what
60:33 - they achieved and then tell you you
60:35 - shouldn't do that like is Success only
60:37 - relegated for them that's how I kind of
60:39 - take these type of phrases it's like
60:41 - there's a good kind of thing you can say
60:43 - and then there's a bad kind of thing you
60:44 - can say saying you should never do that
60:45 - that's probably not the right phrase
60:47 - saying hey you know you got to know when
60:48 - the trade-offs are and you got to be
60:49 - able to make the right decisions and at
60:51 - some points in your life it is good to
60:53 - do something that's probably unhealthy
60:55 - for a short period of time like that's
60:57 - okay if you're a founder and you want
60:59 - your company to be a success well
61:00 - there's only one choice you have to make
61:02 - you just got to have more hours in like
61:04 - that's that's just going to ultimately
61:05 - make it potentially more successful and
61:08 - it's not like it's good I don't
61:09 - recommend anyone doing a 100 hours worth
61:11 - of work a week like that's just not
61:13 - healthy like it's not physically healthy
61:15 - spiritually or emotionally healthy but
61:17 - if I had to do it for six months I would
61:18 - do it for six months not that I want to
61:20 - it's just a kind of like a a willingness
61:22 - to do that uh as far as like work life
61:25 - balance stuff goes and all that how I
61:28 - think about it is that I see it all I I
61:29 - do see this quite frequently people talk
61:31 - about how important that is but when it
61:33 - comes to actual life balance they're
61:36 - around their kids they're around their
61:37 - wife they're around their husband
61:38 - they're around family moms whatever but
61:41 - their brain is completely somewhere
61:44 - else they're not they're not in it and
61:47 - so it's just like that's not work life
61:49 - balance yeah you're just somewhere else
61:51 - like that that how does that count and
61:53 - so it's like if you're going to do
61:54 - something you should just do it you
61:56 - should just do it well and so when I go
61:58 - home I turn off my work brain and I can
62:01 - just do that and it's it's a skill I've
62:03 - been practicing it it wasn't just
62:05 - something that immediately you know
62:06 - popped out of nowhere it was something
62:08 - that took effort and effort and effort
62:10 - and how I typically go about it is it's
62:12 - the same thing when you're at work and
62:13 - you get distracted you will never be
62:15 - able to take away distractions but you
62:16 - will be able to respond to a distraction
62:19 - when you realize you're distracted to
62:21 - respond in the positive that is your
62:22 - chance uh you know I have had different
62:25 - phrases my life to describe it but
62:27 - that's how I think about it now which is
62:28 - that you can't control the distraction
62:30 - you can control how you respond when you
62:32 - realize and so when I'm with my kids
62:34 - that time to realize I'm being
62:36 - distracted has just gotten smaller and
62:37 - smaller and smaller because I actively
62:39 - fight against it the moment I realize
62:41 - I'm not doing something I don't finish
62:42 - the thought I don't keep on thinking
62:44 - about be like oh I should really do this
62:45 - but hold on you know okay well what
62:47 - about no no no cut it off the end move
62:49 - on back in you know oh I don't I really
62:52 - don't feel like getting up I really
62:53 - don't feel like crawling on the ground I
62:55 - really don't feel like caring my kids
62:56 - you know what shut up you're going to do
62:58 - it cuz it means way more to them and it
63:00 - really doesn't feel that bad I'm willing
63:01 - to lift weights I could be willing to
63:02 - crawl on the ground yeah you know it's
63:04 - just like that willingness that desire
63:05 - to like not listen to the thing that
63:07 - says don't do it but listen to the thing
63:08 - that says this is going to be like I'm
63:10 - in the moment so when I'm programming I
63:13 - want gosh darn it I want to be
63:14 - programming and when I'm with my kids
63:16 - gosh darn it I want to be with my
63:18 - kids yeah do you do you find that they
63:21 - ever like bleed into one another like
63:23 - like I mean do you work at home or do
63:24 - you have like a you know
63:26 - some sort of bar that I converted yeah I
63:29 - have a horse barn that I converted that
63:30 - is you can walk across your property to
63:32 - your studio essentially yeah yeah yeah
63:35 - yeah but I do have a physical barrier
63:36 - which I think does help a physical
63:38 - barrier does help uh uh you know I if
63:41 - you have some form of of routine I think
63:45 - routine helps a lot because then you can
63:47 - build that muscle via routine to like
63:49 - stop doing
63:51 - something you know like that's just
63:53 - pract more practical tips you know so if
63:55 - you if you get off of work get off work
63:56 - at the same time every
63:58 - day you know don't you sometimes you
64:00 - can't control when you start work but
64:02 - you can always control when you stop and
64:04 - you just force yourself to stop and it's
64:07 - just like I I always say the same thing
64:08 - with sleep if you want to get a good
64:09 - sleep schedule you don't control when
64:11 - you go to bed you control when you wake
64:12 - up your body will eventually say uncle
64:14 - and will start we we'll fall in line but
64:18 - there will be a time of period where
64:19 - it's very uncomfortable but you kind of
64:21 - forced yourself into a new schedule 5:00
64:23 - is when I'm going to wake up like sorry
64:25 - me who stayed up till midnight last
64:27 - night man this sucks but I'm going to
64:29 - drink 14 cups of coffee and just call it
64:31 - a day until I can like make myself fall
64:34 - into line and so that's kind of like the
64:35 - ideas that I I generally float around
64:37 - with is just creating strong um routines
64:40 - and so I get off at 4 I get up I try to
64:42 - get up at 5: and I go straight to work I
64:45 - like make coffee and go straight to work
64:46 - I don't do a morning routine there's no
64:47 - red light therapy cold plunge hot plunge
64:49 - all that kind of stuff just bam straight
64:51 - to work right and just go right into it
64:54 - because that's the only way I can get in
64:55 - the hours I want yeah the best thing I
64:57 - ever did for my sleep schedule was have
64:59 - kids cuz my kids wake up at 7 o' no
65:02 - matter what sometimes 6:30 yeah and
65:04 - eventually you will fall into line like
65:06 - you I mean you you most certainly
65:08 - experienced this you probably were a
65:10 - night outl I'm a light I'm a natural
65:11 - night out I'd rather program at 1: in
65:13 - the morning than 1 in the afternoon and
65:14 - it's just like a natural part of me but
65:17 - it's just like you know I just fought it
65:18 - and changed it because life
65:19 - circumstances forced it and so then I
65:21 - just leaned
65:22 - in yeah so let's talk a little I mean we
65:26 - we could go through the whole like your
65:27 - entire developer origin story but like
65:29 - frankly I'm more interested in just
65:30 - gleaning like insight and sharing them
65:32 - with you because you're prolific man
65:34 - like I'm I'm sure you're aware of this
65:36 - but like you stream a ton you have like
65:39 - three YouTube channels where you're
65:41 - publishing stuff you you are constantly
65:43 - posting on Twitter uh and other probably
65:46 - other social media as well and uh and
65:49 - you're building like substantial you're
65:51 - like not just on the stream like let's
65:52 - chat you're actually building things and
65:55 - uh you know
65:56 - maning theow of and responding
65:59 - intelligently while you're also holding
66:01 - a of in your head when you're cing like
66:04 - I want to get I don't want this to turn
66:07 - devolve into like productivity bullet
66:08 - points or anything like that but but
66:10 - like if you want to learn a little bit
66:11 - more about your process if if that's
66:13 - cool um and maybe you could walk me
66:17 - through like a typical day like do you
66:18 - know when you're sitting down what
66:20 - you're going to do that day like you you
66:22 - get your coffee it's 5:00 a.m. you're
66:24 - walking you live in uh like a pretty
66:26 - cold part of North America right like
66:29 - yeah yeah I live in South Dakota so it's
66:31 - cold it also is hot during the summer
66:33 - colder than here in Texas very
66:35 - variable yeah so you're like trudging
66:38 - through I mean Texas potentially to this
66:39 - horse barn and you're sitting down I
66:42 - hope you have insulation in
66:44 - there you have insulation you have a
66:46 - space heater how how do you stay
66:47 - warm I I do have I have a mini split
66:50 - that I put up there that was like the
66:51 - most expensive part of this it was
66:53 - Framing and the mini split that were the
66:54 - two big ones and so yeah so this is
66:57 - paint that's like a literal pain wall
66:59 - you're not using like the flimsy green
67:00 - screen never aink I got a green room
67:04 - unironically Green Room yeah so so like
67:07 - let's talk about like okay 5:00 a.m.
67:09 - like put us in the shoes of the primagen
67:11 - as he's sipping his coffee oh
67:14 - wow yeah so it's like it's like it's a
67:17 - real it's a real green room and then of
67:20 - course there's the camera the ring light
67:22 - there's a bunch of yeah there's a bunch
67:24 - of foam
67:26 - fil all over the place like if I go on
67:28 - that
67:28 - side the the next season of the
67:30 - Mandalorian could be filmed right there
67:32 - in your Horse
67:34 - bar it could be yeah this is L literally
67:37 - A Horse bar and two stalls very cool so
67:41 - like what is your day like like you got
67:42 - the you got the coffee you're walking
67:44 - out there you're sitting
67:46 - down what happens walk us through it uh
67:50 - I generally come in with a very very uh
67:55 - I know that I'm going to program I know
67:57 - I'm going to do something and that's
67:59 - typically how I start like I I have a
68:01 - project that I've been building and that
68:02 - project is fairly complex or fairly
68:05 - Technical and I know that if I just sit
68:07 - down I'll just you know I'm it will come
68:09 - back to me all the things I need to
68:10 - learn so sometimes you know as I BS or
68:12 - talk with people I'm I'm in my back
68:13 - brain going okay what was the last thing
68:15 - I did okay I remember all this stuff all
68:17 - right now I know what I need to do like
68:18 - I have five things that I know I need to
68:20 - do to put this what I'm working on on
68:23 - the Shelf I just don't remember right
68:25 - now that there what the five things are
68:27 - I'm sure I could like derive them if I
68:28 - just rewalk the path but we'll start
68:31 - later and I'll start figuring out things
68:33 - and get it done well tell us a little
68:35 - bit about your frame of like what you
68:37 - experience as somebody who has a
68:39 - thousand people watching you on Twitch
68:40 - and like rapidly typing you know
68:42 - comments and what it's like to watch
68:44 - that that all that stream by knowing
68:46 - that you got to keep the show going this
68:47 - is live uh yeah like like what is what
68:52 - does it feel
68:54 - like um you know it's shockingly it
68:57 - doesn't feel much different than when I
68:58 - had 30 people watching me or 20 people
69:00 - uh when I started uh programming on
69:02 - Twitch uh a big stream was like 30
69:05 - people that was like amazing and so it's
69:08 - like yeah it's changed quite a bit but
69:10 - it's it's still the same thing I'm still
69:12 - just trying to build something that's
69:13 - ridiculous I don't have like you know I
69:15 - don't have just some you know a lot of
69:18 - people you you'll see a lot of people
69:19 - with these things where they have all
69:20 - these um they have all these tips and
69:24 - like oh man such good marketing ideas
69:27 - and oh you know you got to send it at
69:28 - this time of the day to do these kind of
69:30 - things and oh you want to talk about
69:32 - this at this time and I just have I have
69:35 - no I have literally no
69:38 - plans so you're just relying on your
69:41 - ability to perform in the moment
69:43 - essentially like uh it's a it's a
69:45 - performance essentially there there's
69:47 - not like a whole lot of yeah systems in
69:50 - place to like help you uh like like
69:53 - perhaps like a less interesting streamer
69:54 - would just have gimmicks or something
69:56 - like oh let's go to dumb human dumb pet
69:58 - tricks or something like that or
70:00 - whatever it would be like different
70:01 - segments or thing do do you do anything
70:03 - like that or is it like and I'll be
70:05 - completely can I've never sat down and
70:06 - like actually watched one of your
70:07 - streams I just watch YouTube and I watch
70:09 - it like double speed and I usually watch
70:11 - it while I'm doing something else like
70:12 - not to denigrate your art or anything
70:14 - like that but uh what would a typical
70:17 - flow be like for somebody who's never
70:19 - watched uh you stream
70:21 - before it just depends on the day so I
70:24 - either do a heavy programming day days
70:25 - or we do like article style days and all
70:28 - that and so these are the heavy you know
70:30 - like today was a heavy programming day
70:31 - so for five six hours we just wrote go
70:33 - code uh wrote All of Huffman encoding
70:37 - for stuff and I could do you know
70:39 - various value size and all that for
70:41 - Huffman en coding and then we ended up
70:42 - beating gzip for this kind of real-time
70:44 - rendering engine that I'm doing right
70:46 - now and so that was fantastic I was very
70:48 - very happy about that but that was today
70:50 - and so that was the plan I knew I wanted
70:52 - to get far into the Huffman thing didn't
70:53 - think I was going to put a bow on it but
70:54 - hey we put a bow on it and so now it's
70:56 - done now I get to move on to the next
70:57 - thing quad trees uh I have a theory that
71:00 - if you break up the screen into various
71:02 - regions those regions change less than
71:04 - if you try to do the entire screen at
71:07 - once for encoding and so obviously this
71:09 - all this stuff has been done before but
71:10 - I'm just doing it myself and I'm doing
71:12 - it all myself and I'm going to make a
71:13 - you know little fun engine for game
71:16 - stuff and so yeah that's that's the next
71:19 - thing I'll do and and like pardon me if
71:21 - if I'm asking kind of really l l
71:23 - question but essentially just more
71:24 - efficient impression is what you're
71:26 - after yeah yeah then yeah so it's the
71:30 - idea is that I'm rendering in the
71:31 - browser using Dom elements and so
71:33 - everything is rendered on the server and
71:35 - all finished and just on the uh just in
71:38 - the browser do you see the result and
71:40 - that's it and so it's kind of like web
71:42 - RTC or something like that but it's it's
71:44 - just with asky so it's all asky games
71:46 - that's part of the fun I wanted to make
71:48 - them all asky and so it's all browser
71:50 - based asky stuff so it's just like
71:52 - minimizing how much data you send down
71:55 - yeah yeah that's really cool so like uh
71:58 - Dwarf Fortress type games or I mean
72:02 - would that be a representative of the
72:03 - type of games you're developing are you
72:04 - a dwarf well the first one I'm doing is
72:06 - uh I'm I'm I'm encoding Doom okay and
72:10 - we're going to play Doom so that way
72:11 - everyone in chat can play Doom at the
72:13 - same time so instead of having doom on
72:15 - the most bizarre device I want to have
72:17 - 2,000 people play Doom at the same time
72:20 - yeah that's a novel approach instead of
72:21 - running having it running on a pregnancy
72:23 - test you're having a whole bunch of
72:24 - people running on you know twitch is
72:26 - like Twitch Plays Pokemon I think was
72:28 - like an experiment that first one the
72:30 - problem is latency latency sucks
72:33 - right yeah and like turn kind of Doom is
72:37 - very instantaneous like you have to be
72:39 - quickly moving around if you're not
72:41 - going to get slaughtered by these demons
72:43 - right precisely hence the reason why you
72:46 - have to have why I'm building all this
72:48 - real-time stuff is that I want someone
72:49 - to be able to open up a web browser and
72:51 - I'll be shooting up from my computer up
72:53 - into some fly iio noes or something like
72:56 - that and then it will display what's on
72:58 - my computer within like 500 milliseconds
73:00 - see there's some there's some like
73:01 - latency that you could have that's fine
73:05 - it's just that anything beyond that it
73:07 - becomes you know it becomes untenable so
73:09 - if they press in chat and chat takes 200
73:11 - milliseconds to get to my computer plus
73:14 - you know or 300 or 400 or 500
73:16 - milliseconds Plus for them to see what
73:18 - they're seeing is you know 400
73:19 - milliseconds behind that still actually
73:21 - largely works because Doom is such a
73:23 - simple game you don't need to be precise
73:24 - you just need to like like shoot in the
73:25 - Demon's general direction and you hit it
73:28 - so you know there there's a lot of
73:29 - forgiveness in the game this isn't
73:30 - fortnite this is yeah so you're a lot of
73:32 - people are going to be using the double
73:33 - barrel shotgun if they're going to have
73:35 - any success I would imagine um yeah yeah
73:38 - yeah you can select Guns by just
73:40 - selecting a different gun yeah and
73:43 - twitch itself has like a good amount of
73:46 - latency like like several seconds so
73:48 - like if they're looking at the actual
73:50 - twitch stream then what has happened in
73:54 - the game has already moved on like a
73:55 - couple seconds before they their input
73:57 - actually quite a bit so how do you
73:59 - address that is there a way to address
74:01 - that that's why I'm doing the whole Real
74:02 - Time stuff is that they're going to open
74:04 - up a website ah so you're not going to
74:06 - rely on what's on my computer within a
74:08 - few hundred
74:09 - milliseconds and if I really felt like I
74:11 - could shave off another 150 or whatever
74:13 - it is my my guess is my guess is that a
74:15 - lot of my ping up to these servers is
74:16 - like 40 50 milliseconds so it's it's not
74:19 - like terrible and so for me to send up
74:21 - this data and then just have it routed
74:23 - back down to somebody it'll be like 90
74:24 - milliseconds for that it's like not a
74:26 - huge you know it's nothing that's deal
74:29 - breaking the deal breaker will be all
74:30 - twitch chat latency which will be like
74:32 - on the order of 500 milliseconds have
74:34 - you talked to Twitch is there anything
74:35 - you can do to like improve that latency
74:39 - I I could make them so they could play
74:41 - via um just the website but I don't want
74:45 - to yeah it's more fun to make them go on
74:48 - Twitch and all vote with W's and as's
74:51 - and S's and D's to say exactly what they
74:53 - want so it's a consist is like like most
74:56 - people said a here so we're going to
74:57 - move to the left basically like yeah
74:59 - I'll be taking like every 100
75:01 - milliseconds every you know 75
75:03 - milliseconds that consensus will then
75:05 - play that key for the next 75
75:07 - milliseconds or whatever it is except if
75:09 - it's a fire it just plays it once you
75:11 - know and so it's just like you kind of
75:12 - have to make it play these different
75:14 - things and can you do like WF so that it
75:16 - both moves forward and Fires at the same
75:20 - time so I got to figure out like some of
75:21 - those things yeah uh so uh I guess this
75:25 - is an interesting kind of metac
75:26 - cognition thing but there there are
75:27 - going to be a certain number of people
75:28 - in your audience who are going to be
75:29 - wanting to step toward the imp's
75:32 - fireball as opposed to away from it and
75:35 - what if the number of trolls or Griefers
75:37 - like outnumbers the people who just want
75:39 - to play an honest game of
75:42 - Doom then we lose like that's that's the
75:45 - end you know the thing is is most
75:47 - generally speaking most people want to
75:49 - win so that's the nice part uh so that's
75:52 - why the second game I want to develop is
75:53 - going to be a tower defense where it's
75:55 - chat versus me and you can
75:58 - troll just the thing is you got to pay
76:01 - Bits And if you troll you hurt yourself
76:04 - you let me win so then there's like this
76:06 - whole fundamental thing so you the troll
76:08 - toll is only to hurt yourself and so the
76:10 - whole idea is that you get to if you're
76:14 - going to troll you make your own team
76:15 - lose and which makes me win and you the
76:18 - viewer there's a fundamental like you
76:22 - don't want the streamer to win yeah like
76:24 - there's there's definitely that just
76:25 - exists they want to see you not be
76:27 - successful so it like puts them in this
76:28 - really painful position where they have
76:30 - to try to make the right decision and
76:33 - you benefit monetarily from the bits I
76:35 - guess they make the worst decision if
76:37 - they troll to then you know yeah it's
76:40 - going to cost them five bucks so you
76:43 - have been successful on two mediums so
76:45 - this is like not like their influencers
76:47 - can never break off of Tik Tok right and
76:49 - like never really have success out of
76:51 - their their first platform but you have
76:52 - managed to kind of like transplant
76:54 - yourself over onto YouTube through like
76:56 - these vods video on demand and and other
76:58 - things like that you you seem to have
76:59 - like a really good editor uh who
77:02 - identifies like interesting clips and
77:03 - like chops them out and puts them up as
77:05 - Standalone videos like so you're kind of
77:08 - at the Forefront of the difference in
77:09 - culture between twitch which is
77:11 - primarily gamer driven and like YouTube
77:14 - which I mean is like everybody is the
77:16 - biggest website on the internet
77:17 - basically yeah um and like like so
77:21 - you're almost kind of like in a position
77:22 - where you could be like a cultural
77:23 - anthropologist
77:25 - uh between those two worlds like what
77:27 - are some of the things you've observed
77:28 - that are different on Twitch and the
77:31 - nature of that Medium versus YouTube
77:34 - which is you know like like real time
77:36 - with with chat versus YouTube with its
77:38 - extremely sluggish comment system not
77:41 - sluggish but like yeah you know people
77:43 - watch the video then they it's not it's
77:45 - not for communication yeah it's not for
77:47 - synchronous communication um it's for
77:50 - you
77:51 - know I always feel bad using the term
77:53 - async ever since Annie
77:56 - made a big deal about async and now I'm
77:57 - just like oh man it's so true async
78:00 - means to you know asynchronous
78:01 - communication is to take two
78:03 - Communications and synchronize them so
78:05 - we've been using the word all wrong but
78:07 - uh uh twitch is you go to Twitch for
78:14 - connection so that means that you're
78:17 - going there because you want to see
78:19 - someone you have something in mind
78:22 - typically is what twitch is about
78:25 - and YouTube you typically go to YouTube
78:27 - to watch something you want to watch and
78:29 - so there're just vastly different crowds
78:32 - people that you know really like YouTube
78:34 - they they they they'll just pretty much
78:36 - largely stay on YouTube people that
78:37 - really like twitch will largely just
78:38 - stay on Twitch okay so you've cultivated
78:41 - two like very different audiences um
78:44 - generally yeah have you
78:46 - noticed so like a lot of people probably
78:49 - have a parasocial relationship with you
78:51 - where like you don't necessarily know a
78:53 - whole lot about them but they know quite
78:54 - a bit about you especially if they spent
78:56 - a substantial amount of time watching
78:57 - your videos it could be said that before
78:59 - this call I had a parasocial
79:01 - relationship with you and you Pro you
79:03 - may not have had any sort of
79:04 - relationship with me I don't know if you
79:05 - ever listened to the free cocan podcast
79:06 - before so no I just knew your picture
79:08 - that's it ah well um what uh like how do
79:14 - you interact with people on Twitch and
79:16 - do you even go over to YouTube and like
79:18 - interacting the comment section on
79:20 - YouTube generally I stay away from the
79:22 - comment section uh just because there's
79:24 - a lot of really nice comments but then
79:25 - there's also a lot of like not so nice
79:26 - comments and so you know that's just a
79:29 - you know that's just a reality to all of
79:30 - it and so I'm I'm I'm okay with that and
79:33 - so I just I I don't like to I just don't
79:36 - it's just not there so I I like all the
79:37 - live stuff and so it's fun like talking
79:40 - to them because you can have like a more
79:41 - real conversation whereas if you you
79:43 - know if you're trying to respond to
79:45 - Twitch comments or a a YouTube comment
79:48 - section it's just like you say something
79:50 - they may say say something back but
79:52 - you'll probably never get the
79:53 - notification you have absolutely no idea
79:55 - what happened so it's like there's no
79:56 - real back and forth or real
79:58 - communication with it all and so
80:00 - it's it's just different yeah it's kind
80:03 - of like if I go on if I go on YouTube I
80:06 - have something like it's like 20,000
80:12 - notifications yeah that's a
80:14 - lot those are those are mostly like
80:16 - people commenting on things that
80:18 - unfortunately comments that you probably
80:19 - won't have the time to read and like
80:21 - thoughtfully respond to yeah
80:25 - how do you do it on Twitch moving back
80:27 - to Twitch because I did live stream
80:29 - coding on Twitch for like maybe like six
80:31 - or eight months or something like that
80:33 - and I was right about like where you
80:34 - were talking like I might have 30 people
80:36 - tuning in like oh let's watch Quincy you
80:38 - know build the early versions of free C
80:40 - camper implement this feature or
80:41 - whatever how many years ago was that
80:44 - nine years ago okay so uh and there
80:47 - wasn't like a live coding section I
80:49 - don't even know if there is a live
80:50 - coding section on Twitch like people
80:52 - have been asking for like live coding
80:54 - like sections on Twitch for a long time
80:56 - is there one now yeah software and game
80:58 - development okay great I'm glad they
81:00 - added that cuz that was like really
81:01 - frustrating that like there was like no
81:03 - discovery on Twitch um yeah discover you
81:05 - never go to Twitch for Discovery that's
81:06 - generally A good rule thumb yeah and you
81:10 - know I it felt weird for me to be using
81:12 - like Twitter and like these other places
81:14 - that worked really hard to like try to
81:15 - steer attention to Twitch was a platform
81:18 - that like at the time N9 years ago not
81:20 - very many people got it I still don't
81:21 - really get it frankly like I don't use
81:22 - twitch uh just because like I podcast at
81:25 - Double speed while I'm like you know
81:27 - walking my kids and stuff like that like
81:29 - everything I don't know maybe that
81:31 - sounds like to toxic productivity type
81:33 - stuff but but like the idea of me
81:35 - sitting there and just watching somebody
81:37 - at real in real time do stuff on Twitch
81:40 - uh so so like I just want to be
81:41 - forthcoming I don't get twitch but but
81:43 - you seem you may missed doing it a
81:45 - little bit like if you were programming
81:47 - a whole bunch and you're just hanging
81:48 - out a lot of times people just use it as
81:51 - co-working space okay I'm over here
81:53 - building something you're over there
81:55 - building something you're remote working
81:57 - you don't have any people that you work
81:59 - with every now and then you start
82:00 - chatting and you know maybe I chat back
82:02 - with you and it's just like oh that's
82:03 - kind of like a fun experience is that
82:05 - how you started with it uh I mean I
82:08 - think that's just generally how people
82:11 - view it is this is just like something
82:13 - that they they're a part of
82:16 - it I think it's more of that kind of
82:18 - like so it's just more of a social
82:19 - interaction type thing yeah well are
82:24 - there any any big like changes or any
82:26 - big things that you're really excited
82:27 - about on either the twitch or the
82:29 - YouTube front like I know that you've
82:30 - got now your third Channel and I guess
82:32 - one question I have is like why all the
82:34 - channels like one's like news and
82:36 - reaction like article reaction Tech have
82:38 - four I technically have four channels um
82:40 - but yeah yeah I have my edited thought
82:42 - through video channel which I I'm we're
82:45 - editing a video right now H then I I did
82:48 - a keyboard review on the glove 80 um
82:52 - then I have like kind of like my article
82:53 - read hot t Channel and then I have uh me
82:57 - just long form programming Channel and
82:59 - then I have just like clips and shorts
83:01 - and just just things that I said and did
83:04 - on stream channel
83:06 - okay yeah reason being is it it should
83:08 - be pretty it should be pretty obvious uh
83:11 - but maybe maybe it isn't most people
83:12 - that watch you don't subscribe the
83:14 - people that do subscribe uh they come
83:16 - and they go and so if you don't have a
83:19 - voice on your channel you will attract
83:21 - many different groups and then as your
83:23 - videos go out you'll have these many
83:25 - different groups see your channel and
83:26 - they'll go oh I don't watch that you
83:28 - know and so you just have these like
83:29 - hard Nos and so Google doesn't really
83:31 - know how to promote that and so they
83:32 - just kind of shut it down and so it's
83:33 - just like okay here's my here's my
83:35 - people that want to watch curated
83:37 - engineering videos here is a curated
83:39 - engineering video oh people that just
83:41 - want to hear me riff off of an article
83:43 - or or something like that or a TW a
83:45 - tweet or something like that here's this
83:47 - group that just is like engineering
83:48 - ajacent they just want to hear about
83:49 - programming in Broad terms uh here's the
83:52 - hardcore coding one because if I just
83:54 - took an hour coding video and threw it
83:55 - on any of the other channels it just
83:56 - would it would just do horrible because
83:58 - that's just not the expectation people
84:01 - have yeah and so that's the that's the
84:04 - idea is that you just you create your
84:06 - own verticals and it just makes more
84:08 - sense because people just they don't
84:10 - want to see all the same content you
84:12 - have a pretty big audience of people
84:15 - that uh take your opinion seriously and
84:17 - it it carries a lot of weight especially
84:19 - as far as like you know programming
84:22 - practices or uh things that you think
84:25 - are you know more effective than other
84:28 - things you know just just basically like
84:30 - trade-offs where people's opinion can
84:32 - fall on one side or the other but you
84:33 - have a strong opinion in a lot of these
84:35 - cases but you've said I'm just a man
84:38 - giving my opinion on the internet like
84:40 - how do you reconcile like just being a
84:42 - man giving your opinion with the
84:44 - responsibility of like essentially
84:46 - training a lot of the maybe mid career
84:48 - devs that tune in to your uh to your
84:51 - Twitch stream and and watch your YouTube
84:52 - videos
84:55 - like like how do you carry that
84:57 - responsibility uh as far as carry the
84:59 - responsibility I just don't think about
85:00 - it but I mean gen I know that sounds
85:03 - kind of weird but I mean generally
85:04 - speaking is that I really am I just I am
85:06 - just some guy on the internet and I just
85:08 - give my opinion and that's it I don't I
85:10 - don't try to be more than that I don't
85:11 - try to be less than that um I think that
85:15 - I think people often just take
85:16 - everything so dang seriously so I just I
85:18 - just I just do the opposite I think
85:20 - that's I think that's why I've been been
85:22 - so successful is that if you look at the
85:23 - older kind of the longer stayed Twitter
85:27 - Tech celebrities they're all so serious
85:30 - and and you know and as in the last like
85:32 - two years I feel like I single-handedly
85:34 - have destroyed a lot of the online tech
85:36 - Twitter like what it was uh I feel very
85:39 - proud of that but it's just it's just it
85:41 - was so serious all the time it's just
85:43 - like so highbrow and the thing is is
85:46 - that most people just aren't highbrow
85:47 - most people are just normal people that
85:49 - don't care and they just would rather
85:50 - laugh a little and you know if there's a
85:52 - little something to discuss about Tech
85:55 - then we'll talk about tech and then
85:56 - we'll make some stupid tweet you know
85:57 - like I just like today just all I did
85:59 - was make a tweet where it's just if you
86:01 - know new promise instead of reject or
86:04 - resolve reject it was respect disrespect
86:07 - you know it's just like there's nothing
86:08 - to that and someone said it the best
86:10 - part someone even said it in the chat
86:11 - and so I was just like MIT grabbed it
86:13 - and tweeted it or turned it into like a
86:15 - code picture and then tweeted it and
86:17 - it's like that just does fantastic
86:18 - because it doesn't mean anything it's
86:20 - just a dumb observation that we're all
86:23 - familiar with and that's it and like
86:25 - that's that's just fun and so I just I
86:28 - feel like the the the general discourse
86:30 - is still struggling between these two
86:32 - halves but it's definitely like just
86:34 - caving to one side which is just you
86:37 - know it's not like like maybe maybe it
86:41 - doesn't have to be that important on at
86:42 - all times maybe not everything has to be
86:44 - the most academic maybe it can just be
86:46 - dumb for the sake of being dumb and we
86:47 - can just have fun about it and that's
86:49 - okay it's only male modeling it's it's
86:53 - just models all the way down and so it's
86:57 - funny I don't know I just I I've enjoyed
86:59 - it I've really enjoyed it yeah so
87:02 - another thing that I think is really
87:03 - interesting about uh you is like you
87:07 - jump from one project to another but you
87:08 - do actually finish the products usually
87:11 - um and you say uh you've said that you
87:14 - love the process of creation for
87:16 - creation's sake but as creation turns
87:19 - into maintenance it starts to feel like
87:22 - work since most projects eventually
87:24 - become more about maintenance than
87:26 - creation if you're working like with
87:27 - like a large Legacy codebase or
87:29 - something like that you're probably
87:30 - spending I don't know maybe maybe you
87:31 - could argue on this point but you're
87:33 - probably spending about as much time
87:34 - just maintaining that and making sure
87:36 - that that continues to work as you are
87:38 - actually building out new functionality
87:39 - and stuff would is that a fair statement
87:41 - yeah yeah Harpoon is like my big Thorn
87:43 - to my side it's my most popular plugin I
87:45 - absolutely love it it works for me but
87:47 - people keep using it in Stupid Ways and
87:48 - they want me to fix it and so I'm just
87:50 - like I don't know quit doing it that way
87:53 - you know but I also realize that there's
87:55 - some bugs and some things that people
87:56 - want fixed or some extensions and so
87:57 - it's like I need to do some stuff I I
87:59 - really do need to spend another two
88:01 - weeks or probably I I honestly probably
88:04 - need to spend just 10 more hours kind of
88:05 - just wrapping up stuff with Harpoon and
88:07 - then I can release version two on
88:10 - 69 yeah so how do you know when it's
88:14 - time to like just let a project rot or
88:17 - like completely deprecate it and and
88:20 - move on with your life it's just when
88:22 - when I don't care anymore that's it
88:24 - you know I I build things for the sake
88:26 - of building them and if if there's
88:27 - something that I really like I build it
88:29 - to the point where I like it and use it
88:30 - all the time what makes you care about
88:32 - it is it like knowing a whole lot of
88:34 - people are depending on it because
88:35 - there's a lot of Open Source projects
88:36 - that like you know everybody's depending
88:38 - on like you know I think like Heartbleed
88:40 - and the one guy in his you know server
88:42 - closet like trying to keep basically the
88:44 - internet afloat uh and uh you know
88:47 - pretty thankless job but like that has
88:49 - to be maintained right that's Mission
88:50 - critical infrastructure is there
88:51 - anything You' built that you feel is
88:54 - like even though you don't like working
88:56 - on it you feel compelled to work on it
88:57 - just because so many people are
88:58 - depending on it oh yeah Harpoon would be
89:00 - the only one and so that's the one that
89:02 - I I will try to make something better
89:05 - with it but I I I like it the way it is
89:08 - and I don't want to add new features and
89:10 - so it's like me just saying no is the
89:12 - predominant way I maintain it but every
89:15 - now and then I begrudgingly add
89:16 - something yeah yeah and you said that
89:20 - programming is such a key part of your
89:21 - life and that it's always been such a
89:23 - part of your life that you really can't
89:25 - even imagine doing anything other than
89:27 - programming let's say hypothetically
89:29 - that you're like a Kevin mitnik type
89:31 - character rip and the FBI has literally
89:35 - forbade you forbade forbidded you from
89:38 - using computers for like 10 years or
89:40 - something like you cannot get within 10t
89:42 - of a computer or you're going directly
89:44 - to jail like if you were in a situation
89:46 - like that where you literally could not
89:47 - program what would you do like where
89:50 - would you Channel your
89:51 - time property property what do you mean
89:54 - by property real estate
89:58 - Adventures let's talk about that for a
89:59 - second uh because you used to live in
90:02 - San Francisco Bay area where I used to
90:04 - live before I moved back to Texas um and
90:06 - you moved back to back to uh South South
90:10 - Dakota South Dakota yeah and and like
90:15 - obviously there's like a you can buy a
90:17 - lot more in South Dakota and you can buy
90:20 - a lot more in Texas than you can in San
90:21 - Francisco uh have you ever thought about
90:24 - taking like your ridiculously high
90:26 - Netflix you know like I don't know if
90:28 - Netflix like adjusts your income at all
90:29 - if you like work remotely or if you move
90:31 - to a different place yeah they they
90:32 - adjusted my income for sure okay I don't
90:34 - work there anymore I I worked there for
90:35 - 10 and a half years and recently quit
90:37 - about a month and a half ago yeah so but
90:40 - but up until that point like what were
90:41 - you thinking about doing with those fund
90:43 - like where does the extra money go is it
90:44 - just going towards supporting a family
90:46 - of six uh we did a very big investment
90:49 - into the land that we bought we bought a
90:51 - strategic place as opposed to a place to
90:53 - live um just because we knew that a lot
90:55 - of building was going this direction the
90:56 - school was bidding on land near us all
90:58 - that kind of stuff and so we bought a
91:00 - plot of land as as an investment you
91:02 - know to try to hold for five years and
91:03 - it's it's fairly expensive so that's
91:05 - where most of our funds honestly go um
91:07 - so that's that's one thing uh the next
91:09 - thing is that after that we just kind of
91:11 - put a lot of we've just focused on my
91:14 - wife really likes running airbnbs and so
91:16 - we got a couple airbnbs and she just
91:18 - loves doing that and she likes
91:20 - Remodeling and all that and so or she
91:22 - does I let me rephrase that she hates
91:24 - remodeling but she knows she needs to do
91:26 - it to make the place look really nice
91:27 - and be the way she wants it to be and so
91:29 - that's where like a lot of her effort
91:30 - and time gets spent and so I know if I
91:32 - couldn't do this I would just pivot into
91:34 - that you know I just learn all the
91:35 - things you need to learn to be really
91:37 - great at that because it's it's like all
91:40 - all these activities aren't hard they're
91:42 - again it's just time right like just
91:43 - like programming programming I mean
91:44 - programming is objectively hard but it's
91:46 - also just a time orienting and so if I
91:49 - were to do some of these things like I I
91:50 - would never be a great woodworker I
91:52 - probably am starting way too l uh late
91:54 - in my life but could I hang sheetrock
91:56 - yeah I could hang sheetrock and you know
91:59 - learn to paint learn to refinish floors
92:01 - do everything and just get really good
92:03 - at that and just put my time completely
92:05 - into that yeah it's funny you mentioned
92:07 - woodworking because there's like this
92:09 - meme or something that like programmers
92:11 - like all the programmers today are the
92:13 - people that would be Woodworkers like
92:15 - 100 years ago 200 years ago and that
92:17 - like do you see parallels between doing
92:20 - things with your hands like in in a like
92:22 - a wood shop or or even metal shop like
92:24 - and you know building
92:26 - software yeah I mean you could also
92:29 - probably swap us out with like
92:30 - potentially painters and all that but I
92:31 - mean obviously back then things were so
92:33 - much different and so like here's a good
92:35 - example that did you know that college
92:37 - uh the original idea of a Bachelor of
92:39 - Arts was to prepare someone's life for
92:42 - leisure so it was the it was the act of
92:45 - um of endowing someone who's already
92:48 - rich with the ability to know how to
92:49 - read and follow out the poets and all
92:51 - that so I would definitely probably not
92:53 - be in that c category just if my life
92:55 - were simar I would probably not be on
92:56 - that side and so when people are doing
92:58 - these you know I probably wouldn't be on
92:59 - the art side would be would be a fair
93:01 - take I wouldn't be writing poetry SL
93:03 - doing art but you know I think that it's
93:05 - just the creation part it's just that
93:07 - you want to be able to build things and
93:10 - most of the things you build are
93:11 - probably just very practical for your
93:12 - life in the moment just you know so I'd
93:15 - probably fall on that side maybe I'd
93:17 - hope yeah you know the reality is
93:19 - probably if I lived 200 years ago I'd
93:21 - probably be on a
93:22 - farm or die in it would have probably
93:24 - been pretty horrible but you know like
93:26 - luckily I don't have to you know be in
93:27 - that time yeah unfortunately most people
93:30 - probably would have died like long
93:31 - before their time before they could
93:33 - realize their creative Pursuits just
93:34 - because it's the way things were was and
93:37 - people forget that yeah and people also
93:39 - yeah forget that fact about higher
93:41 - education that it wasn't designed to
93:43 - train you know soldiers returning from
93:45 - World War II to be able to enter
93:47 - industry and it was designed to help
93:49 - rich kids be able to have peacock brains
93:52 - and show off to mates and stuff like
93:53 - that basically and and to be able to fit
93:56 - in at dinner parties and oh look at
93:58 - Junior he's so audite you know stuff
94:00 - like that and yeah it was literally 1%
94:03 - like in the most educated place in the
94:05 - world London the 1900s right like like
94:09 - college really did not pick up steam as
94:12 - something that people did until post
94:13 - World War II era um when the government
94:16 - started funding uh through the GI Bill
94:18 - and stuff like that but anyway I digress
94:20 - but it is really interesting uh that
94:22 - like you know like you could actually
94:25 - kind of consider programming more of a
94:26 - craftsmanship than you could consider it
94:29 - like a high art or whatever right I I
94:33 - don't know where do you fall in that
94:34 - Spectrum like like CRA or an
94:37 - artisan probably depends on the area
94:40 - right uh you know like if you're doing
94:41 - like the really high academic thought
94:43 - things machine learning I think once you
94:45 - get into like I don't know if you've
94:46 - ever handrolled your own MLP or RBF or
94:48 - any of those things uh it's it's it's
94:50 - it's a lot of effort and now you you
94:51 - know once you start getting into the
94:52 - research area then I think you fall into
94:54 - this really intense like it's much more
94:58 - of an artisan become a master at math
95:00 - and then apply the math to these
95:01 - specific categories and all that kind of
95:03 - stuff that's you know that's a different
95:05 - vibe than uh being able to build stuff
95:09 - yeah you know being able to build stuff
95:11 - quick like I can build most things and
95:13 - most things that I build you know like
95:15 - I've been building this project now for
95:16 - you know about a month and a half and
95:18 - I've probably put a good 100 plus hours
95:19 - 200 hours into it and I've just been
95:22 - building only the coing side of things
95:24 - how to make a bunch of bites and make
95:25 - them smaller and I've built almost
95:27 - everything out and now I'm going to
95:29 - combine them all like right now and you
95:31 - know the interfaces largely just all
95:33 - fell together almost just perfectly
95:35 - despite making many mid mid programming
95:38 - shifts it's just because I've just done
95:39 - it for so long that I have a bunch of
95:41 - just like General ideas of how to
95:43 - program for the long term and this is
95:45 - kind of where that craftsmanship comes
95:46 - in where I can just kind of I I will
95:48 - fall within the 80 to 90% now it won't
95:51 - be you know won't hit a 100 but most of
95:54 - the time but I I'll I'll hit a good 80
95:55 - 90% pretty regularly and so that's like
95:58 - it's fun you know it's that it's that
95:59 - craftsmanship that's building quality
96:01 - stuff yeah I mean how much do you feel
96:02 - like you're just like falling back on
96:04 - your instincts that are honed over the
96:06 - years at the keyboard uh when you're
96:08 - when you're doing like a lot of like
96:09 - does stuff disappear and you're just
96:11 - like doing it or are you frequently
96:13 - pulling back to really think are you
96:15 - going to like the Whiteboard and I
96:16 - rarely rarely really think I rarely I
96:19 - it's just like I just know what I want
96:21 - and I feel like I can see the path and I
96:23 - don't really think about the path it's
96:25 - kind of like walk you know it's like
96:26 - when you go hiking you don't think about
96:27 - every last turn you kind of think like I
96:29 - want to get up to this point and I know
96:31 - there's that one part with the field
96:32 - with the flowers there's this other part
96:34 - with the Rocks you know oh then there's
96:36 - that one part with just a bunch of
96:37 - really tall pine trees right like you
96:39 - just have like these places in your head
96:40 - that you know you're going to go through
96:42 - and then the rest is just kind of you
96:43 - know just
96:45 - details a so it feels like walking and
96:48 - and by the way that walk I just
96:49 - described was uh the easy way on the m
96:52 - in Boseman Montana so if you ever done
96:53 - the hike in bosan Montana to the m it
96:56 - starts off with like a bunch of rocks
96:57 - kind of deeper bush area and then you go
96:59 - out into the field of flowers and then
97:01 - you turn into these really tall pine
97:02 - trees and so it's like know each spot's
97:04 - a little different I don't know how many
97:06 - turns or twists there are in between
97:07 - each but that's generally what happens
97:09 - yeah but you just kind of manually or
97:11 - like instinctively navigate things and
97:14 - it just it just happens right before you
97:15 - know it you're toward the end of the
97:17 - trail um okay so so likening building
97:20 - software and like integrating all these
97:22 - bits of software that you've written
97:24 - almost to just walking a trail because
97:26 - you've been you've done that so many
97:28 - times you kind of just instinctively
97:29 - know how to put one foot in front of the
97:31 - other yeah yeah like I I know what I
97:33 - want so if you watch one of my streams
97:35 - like today programmed I've never ever
97:38 - once in my life done Huffman and coding
97:40 - uh uh ever I've just never built a
97:42 - Huffman and code anything and so last
97:45 - week I watched a five minute YouTube
97:46 - video on it and it's like okay this is
97:48 - how you write a Huffman tree I was like
97:50 - ah okay I I see how that works and so
97:53 - from there I wrote the Huffman tree
97:54 - generator I wrote the in I wrote how how
97:57 - I'm going to Binary serialize that into
97:59 - a protocol so I could have it on the
98:01 - other side how to take that protocol and
98:02 - efficiently walk it and then also how to
98:04 - like how do you encode and decode
98:06 - encoding and decoding is really
98:07 - difficult because you got to walk from
98:08 - the most significant bit to the least
98:09 - significant bit and putting in these
98:10 - bits one at a time and all that and so
98:12 - there's like a lot to it that just
98:14 - wasn't a part of the video I just knew
98:16 - that I would do that like that's it it's
98:17 - just because I've seen it so many times
98:19 - that I've never done something before
98:21 - and I can and I even first tried one of
98:23 - it like genuinely first try just
98:26 - programmed for 45 minutes straight
98:29 - hundreds of lines put it in pressed play
98:32 - and it just worked all the way through
98:34 - unit test pass and everything wow so you
98:36 - like it was like movie coding yeah movie
98:39 - coding yeah yeah yeah it just it's still
98:41 - not movie coding in the sense that the
98:42 - next one I then took me four it took me
98:44 - four runs we do this thing where I get
98:45 - three runs and if I cannot make it pass
98:47 - on the third run then I lose or I win so
98:50 - we have bets and people place Channel
98:51 - points on whether I'm going to win or
98:53 - lose on these things and so today on the
98:55 - encoding side it took me just one try so
98:58 - one out of three to just get it done on
99:00 - the decoding side it took four out of
99:02 - three so I had to go into a second round
99:04 - best out of three to get it so I first
99:07 - tried the second
99:10 - try let's because I bit shifted the
99:12 - wrong direction like that's it I bit
99:14 - shifted I bit shifted the thing over as
99:17 - opposed to bringing it back down so like
99:19 - a very common error the programmers
99:21 - probably just stupid yeah yeah and it
99:24 - sounds like because you've put in the
99:26 - Reps at the keyboard and because you
99:28 - have this massive kind of Corpus of
99:30 - knowledge and learned experience from
99:32 - spending so much time coding that you
99:34 - have this kind of frame this scaffolding
99:36 - that you just kind of throw new ideas on
99:38 - right like you watch this five minute
99:39 - YouTube video and you kind of like maybe
99:41 - almost subconsciously saw the patterns
99:43 - and made these associations and you just
99:45 - internalized it yeah pretty much yeah
99:48 - that's something an experienced
99:49 - programmer can do and that uh maybe
99:51 - that's why like sometimes it's seems
99:53 - like if you're a new developer and
99:55 - you're trying to like solve like a
99:56 - project Oiler problem or something like
99:57 - that and you're just oh my goodness you
99:59 - spend like six hours doing it uh and
100:01 - then you could just like somebody like
100:03 - you could probably sit down and do that
100:04 - in like two or three minutes you know
100:06 - maybe
100:07 - maybe thing with it right yeah yeah and
100:10 - and that's why you know experienced
100:13 - developers are so in demand and we could
100:16 - we could kind of maybe talk about the
100:17 - job market because I do want to talk
100:18 - about AI um yeah we're coming up on two
100:21 - hours so we may want to uh figure out
100:24 - which one because I might get longwinded
100:25 - and talk about 40 minutes on one and
100:27 - then we're just like so far over time
100:29 - that your kids are going be like you're
100:32 - I'm taking my kids to cce's Pizza yeah
100:35 - yeah they they love that means you gota
100:37 - at some point you got to feed them so
100:38 - let's let's pick one you can you can
100:40 - choose okay so let's talk about Ai and
100:44 - let's go that's the one I wanted I mean
100:46 - yeah yeah I I mean I do kind of want to
100:48 - talk about like some of the
100:49 - misconceptions about how it's going to
100:50 - impact the labor market let's just start
100:52 - with with AI though okay okay so you
100:55 - published a video like maybe six or
100:56 - eight months ago a year ago like where
100:58 - you're like I tried uh I tried a
101:01 - co-pilot for like six months and then I
101:03 - just ripped it out and I I didn't want
101:04 - to use it anymore do you remember that
101:05 - video that was about a month and a half
101:07 - ago that I talked about that yeah it was
101:09 - just it was just recently I'm only about
101:11 - a month and a half into not using
101:12 - co-pilot okay but I could have sworn I
101:14 - saw a video like a long time ago where
101:16 - you talked I've started using co-pilot
101:19 - uh I started using it in the beta phase
101:21 - like way before everybody a net Freedman
101:23 - the CEO of GitHub at that point sent me
101:26 - how to use it and gave me the
101:27 - credentials and access to a private
101:29 - GitHub library to be able to use it in
101:30 - Vim okay so you use it like like I just
101:34 - like I'm going to step back I just want
101:35 - to hear your thoughts on co-pilot having
101:38 - been like one of the early beta users
101:39 - having used it a lot having stepped back
101:41 - from it like you know everything that's
101:43 - transpired since this tool kind of fell
101:46 - into your lap MH um so here's my my my
101:51 - general take on cop I think co-pilot is
101:55 - great I think that it's a very fancy
101:58 - autocomplete uh but that's all it is if
102:02 - you don't like I I was starting to get
102:04 - my masters in AI so I have a general
102:05 - idea of how MLPs what what their like
102:07 - purpose is and I have some understanding
102:11 - there's no reasoning that goes on and I
102:13 - know everyone will say you know this or
102:15 - that and oh it's it's AGI and all these
102:17 - kind of things now it's just it's really
102:18 - good at predicting the next set of
102:20 - tokens that should come out you give it
102:21 - some input it gives it it gives you some
102:22 - output it's really great at predictive
102:24 - stuff it's really great at extrapolating
102:25 - and it can just do some things that are
102:27 - just so amazing right you give it a p
102:28 - picture of a pop can it's like pop can
102:31 - right it just knows it doesn't you know
102:32 - like you you look at this and you see
102:34 - green you see green all the way through
102:35 - but a computer like right here that's
102:38 - like white like if you were to look at a
102:40 - picture of this it would dramatically
102:41 - change color because it it's actually
102:44 - it's not it's not green at that point
102:46 - and so but our brain just maps all these
102:48 - things on and makes it so easy and we
102:50 - just don't realize how you know complex
102:52 - these actions actually
102:53 - and so it's you know when I start when I
102:56 - stopped using co-pilot what I realized
102:58 - is that it was just during the time
103:00 - right after I've been learning go for
103:02 - the first time like in a in a serious
103:04 - sense uh I was learning go for about two
103:07 - months and when I turned off co-pilot I
103:09 - realized I didn't know go I didn't I I
103:13 - Bamboozled myself into thinking I knew
103:15 - go I didn't know go and what I knew is
103:17 - how to use co-pilot to write go and I
103:20 - realized like man I'm like I'm not good
103:22 - at this like I thought I was a lot
103:23 - better but I'm really not that good and
103:25 - so I quit using it and I realized all
103:28 - these weird habits I would just like
103:29 - stop
103:30 - typing and you know like one of the
103:32 - videos I watched at not too long ago
103:34 - talked about like the co-pilot pause
103:36 - yeah it's real I would just pause I
103:38 - would just stop for whatever reason
103:41 - that's that waiting for co-pilot to tell
103:43 - me what to do and it's just like I
103:44 - realized I was just like largely
103:46 - inhibiting
103:48 - myself and I did not like that one bit I
103:51 - did not like the fact that I was kind of
103:54 - um it's not that I thought I was going
103:55 - to become redundant or thinking the
103:56 - robots are going to take over I was just
103:58 - simply not I I effectively it's almost
104:02 - like I just filled my coating abilities
104:04 - with water and turned the temperature
104:05 - way down I just froze them in time and
104:07 - so it's just like from when I picked up
104:09 - go for the first time which generally
104:11 - you're like okay at go you can just you
104:13 - can just go if you have any programming
104:14 - experience you just you just know it by
104:16 - nature and so it's like I just froze it
104:17 - and I just kept knowing that same amount
104:19 - of go despite getting faster I was just
104:21 - getting FAS with AI and so once that
104:23 - turned off it was just like I had a I
104:24 - had a reality call and I was like wow
104:26 - okay so I see what it actually does and
104:29 - I don't like that I want to change this
104:31 - I want to be you know I want to be
104:33 - better at it so I turned it off and for
104:34 - the last month I've turned it off and I
104:35 - feel like despite having to type more
104:38 - and I do miss some of the auto completes
104:40 - quite a
104:41 - bit I am happy I still have it off even
104:44 - though I would definitely say I have to
104:45 - type more for sure and there's times
104:47 - where I'm like oh gosh this would be
104:49 - such a good co-pilot Moment Like right
104:50 - here co-pilot would just know exactly
104:52 - what I want you know it's just like it's
104:54 - so obvious what I want and so it's just
104:56 - like that part's painful but the rest is
104:58 - just like so like the tradeoff is just
105:01 - I'm not willing to go back right
105:03 - now so like that's what it is for you
105:07 - like all the hype and everything and
105:09 - it's really just something that saves
105:10 - you a few keystrokes you already know
105:11 - what you wanted to type it's just like
105:12 - okay did it autocomplete it correctly so
105:14 - I don't have to type an extra 60
105:16 - characters
105:18 - here effectively yeah like you can see
105:20 - it too if you start using co-pilot like
105:22 - write something that will read one bite
105:24 - out of a buffer and then name the next
105:26 - me method 16bit reader and then watch it
105:29 - go like that's all it's doing is it's
105:31 - just trying to extrapolate what you're
105:32 - already doing into the next thing and
105:34 - it's just like ah we just got done
105:35 - building this thing that looked like
105:37 - this shape here's the next thing that's
105:38 - probably the shape you're looking for
105:39 - and bada bing bada boom it's just going
105:40 - to work you're going to be like wow that
105:42 - was pretty convenient I like that a
105:43 - whole bunch and it's just like I found
105:45 - like I'm not going to say I was addicted
105:47 - to it but I was most certainly like I
105:49 - was dependent there was a dependency for
105:50 - sure on it and it just I was just so
105:53 - dang Blown Away by how much that thing
105:57 - kind of made my learning process atrophy
106:00 - like I couldn't write a for Loop in in
106:03 - like in Lua so I was doing a lot of Lua
106:05 - as well I could not write a for Loop
106:07 - during that time I realized I did not
106:08 - know the
106:10 - syntax yeah because it always autocom
106:13 - completed it for me it's like do you
106:15 - need to know the syntax I
106:18 - mean toine the word
106:21 - need that's the problem
106:24 - and so it's like that for me it's just
106:25 - like that's that's my big takeaway with
106:27 - co-pilot is that I I believe it's a fan
106:30 - bargain as of right now for those that
106:31 - don't know Dr fa you get what you want
106:34 - in the moment and ultimately it's the
106:36 - devil that takes everything away in the
106:37 - end right you trade something good for
106:39 - ultimately something
106:40 - evil that's my person I know I know some
106:44 - people they strongly disagree with this
106:47 - and they talk about oh man it's it's
106:49 - it's making it so that more it's it's
106:50 - making programming more approachable
106:52 - more people can start programming it is
106:54 - better in general for everybody I hear
106:56 - all those arguments I'm not even arguing
106:58 - against those arguments what I'm saying
107:00 - is that the people that are feeling more
107:02 - productive they're not actually being
107:05 - more productive they're not actually
107:06 - learning anything and there's something
107:09 - pretty serious about that long term
107:11 - there's something very serious about you
107:13 - not actually learning some pretty
107:14 - important skills CU I don't know what
107:17 - the consequence is I could just see in
107:19 - myself the atrophy that happened or the
107:22 - inability like I I saw in myself atrophy
107:25 - is probably not the right term I saw in
107:26 - myself the inability to become good at
107:28 - something that I was doing
107:30 - full-time and so know it at like a more
107:32 - personal level so I was like holy cow
107:34 - that's that's a red flag for me I don't
107:35 - know what the consequences are but
107:36 - that's a red flag yeah and for you like
107:39 - it seems like being good at something is
107:41 - like the whole name of the game like the
107:42 - whole reason you're playing is to get
107:44 - better um so so that like it seems like
107:46 - an incredibly counterproductive thing to
107:50 - basically give yourself a tool that'll
107:51 - help you get your work done faster but
107:53 - your work is always going to you're like
107:55 - plateauing yourself essentially yeah and
107:57 - that I mean that's the big worry is like
107:59 - is is it good for anybody like yeah
108:00 - maybe I like the craft you don't like
108:02 - the craft but then my argument next
108:03 - thing is will you actually will this
108:05 - help you ship faster in six months 12
108:07 - months or are you actually like is there
108:10 - some line that exists where you actually
108:13 - Plateau faster even though the other
108:16 - person maybe took a little bit longer
108:18 - but they grow even faster and you can
108:20 - say oh well it helps me learn the
108:21 - canonical way of doing things all this
108:23 - kind of stuff and my counterargument is
108:25 - that it's really hard to know if the
108:27 - canonical way or what you perceive as
108:29 - the canonical way is actually the good
108:31 - way to write code you don't know like
108:34 - that's it that's the answer again it's
108:36 - not about working hard or smart you just
108:37 - don't know so you have to Simply fail
108:39 - and learn why certain things don't like
108:42 - lend themselves well so if you never
108:43 - have to switch environments switch
108:45 - languages switch you know various things
108:48 - you're not going to like get bamboozled
108:50 - into bad traps you're not going to try
108:51 - to apply a certain of thinking to a
108:53 - problem that's like drastically terrible
108:55 - for it it's CU you just don't have that
108:58 - that experience you you've you've traded
108:59 - it off for Speed yeah do you think that
109:02 - uh people are just kind of like I mean
109:05 - Guitar Hero kind of like got people like
109:07 - at least making the motions of playing
109:08 - guitar even though they weren't really
109:10 - playing guitar but they could feel like
109:12 - they were playing guitar and maybe they
109:13 - were actually developing like some
109:14 - Rhythm and some of the manual dexterity
109:16 - and stuff to play guitar but it's just
109:18 - like this kind of like uh you know
109:21 - Similac of act it's like almost a parody
109:24 - of actual coding if you're just hitting
109:26 - Tab and like tapping a few things and
109:27 - hitting Tab and you're just tabing
109:29 - through the different results and like
109:31 - it
109:32 - it I can definitely see how this is bad
109:35 - for new programmers and potentially bad
109:37 - for like more experienced programs
109:38 - because you're pretty experienced and
109:40 - you're you're thinking it's bad for you
109:42 - at what point do you think that people
109:43 - should introduce this into their
109:45 - workflow let's say they're new to
109:46 - software
109:47 - development completely like they've been
109:49 - coding for like six months they they've
109:50 - solved a bunch of project Oiler problems
109:52 - or they've gone through like a
109:53 - certification on freeo Camp or something
109:55 - like that and they're really still just
109:57 - getting their their wings as developers
110:00 - there's got to be a temptation to use
110:02 - this tool that helps you get things done
110:04 - and and can it feel like training wheels
110:07 - do do you have kids who learned how to
110:08 - ride bikes I guess would be a question
110:10 - yeah yeah yeah I do you know the funny
110:12 - part is that you know the best way to
110:13 - ride to learn how to ride bikes which
110:14 - has been a large big change since we
110:16 - were kids assuming you're approximately
110:18 - the same ages age near me me being 37
110:22 - okay go you definitely have the same
110:23 - experience then training wheels you
110:24 - don't do training wheels anymore
110:26 - training wheels are objectively
110:28 - bad they're not just kind of bad they're
110:30 - objectively bad you don't do training
110:32 - wheels anymore Striders you get kids
110:34 - bikes with no pedals and they learn to
110:37 - push and ride and glide on them and what
110:40 - it does is it it teaches them the more
110:41 - Superior skill to learning how to bike
110:43 - which is
110:44 - balance pedaling is not hard pedaling is
110:47 - something you learn in a moment but
110:49 - balance is that thing you have to go do
110:50 - like 50 times 100 times thousand times
110:53 - until you're like really comfortable
110:54 - making turns and all that you start
110:55 - hitting Hills on those little Striders
110:57 - and kids start going back and forth like
110:58 - they get good at the act of biking just
111:01 - missing the pedaling part and so it's
111:03 - like that has been a huge just a huge
111:06 - game Cher for kids learning how to bike
111:08 - and so I that's that's I look at
111:11 - co-pilot more like training wheel so
111:12 - like should you learn how to uh or
111:15 - should you when should you use co-pilot
111:17 - here's my general rule of thumb is when
111:18 - you should uh use co-pilot if co-pilots
111:20 - produce code that surprises you
111:23 - or if you use co-pilot to solve a
111:25 - problem because you don't know how you
111:26 - probably shouldn't use it it's not an
111:28 - autocomplete it's not a co-pilot it is a
111:31 - pilot you know you're on autopilot
111:35 - change things up learn how to do those
111:37 - things you're the one who
111:39 - autopilot yeah it's doing the actual
111:42 - heavy lifting you're basically just kind
111:43 - of like teeing it up and like letting
111:47 - yeah so are you you should be like it
111:51 - should be you know that like I'm not a
111:53 - sports ball guy but in in in football
111:55 - someone snaps someone catches and lines
111:58 - the ball up and someone kicks are you
111:59 - the kicker or are you the person that
112:01 - sets up the ball you want to be the
112:03 - kicker you're the person doing the thing
112:06 - you want someone that's just like taking
112:07 - out the boiler plate of getting ready to
112:09 - kick for you yeah that's a good analogy
112:13 - so a lot of people are like really
112:14 - freaked out about Ai and like Devon Ai
112:16 - and like you know the the AI hype cycle
112:19 - like has has reached yet another
112:21 - Crescendo in its many years of AI
112:23 - Winters and AI Summers not that it's not
112:25 - bringing a lot of fruit like I use AI
112:27 - all the time and I imagine you do too
112:28 - for good things not just for things that
112:30 - I'm too lazy to do properly right um
112:32 - there are novel things you can do with
112:34 - AI with using like gp4 which I use a lot
112:38 - structured questions that you would
112:39 - never be able to get like a good Google
112:41 - result for but you can potentially have
112:43 - like a a rich conversation with it and
112:45 - like learn stuff and yet a lot of people
112:48 - are really freaking out because they
112:49 - greatly overestimate this token
112:51 - predictor and what it can do and you
112:54 - know yeah like like what would be your
112:55 - advice to somebody who's getting into
112:57 - and you probably get this question all
112:58 - the time I get it like several times a
113:00 - day I'm not exaggerating like people
113:01 - email me all the time uh yeah what at
113:04 - least once or twice a stream someone
113:06 - asked this exact question about is the
113:08 - AI going to take our jobs what's going
113:10 - to happen am I just learning a useless
113:12 - skill like there's like a thousand of
113:13 - this that direction of questions that
113:15 - are all kind of wrapped up into the
113:17 - answer that I'm I'm going to attempt to
113:19 - give okay great
113:20 - uh so let's first start with
113:24 - momentum uh the internet we can all
113:26 - argue is a phenomenal uh thing for
113:29 - business right businesses have been able
113:31 - to do a vast amount more with less
113:34 - resources due to the internet existing
113:37 - the internet started coming around with
113:38 - what arpanet in the 60s it really
113:40 - started to hit its stride in the 90s
113:42 - when you started getting uh
113:44 - 144k and 56k modems like how long until
113:48 - you really started to see the internet
113:50 - well the first.com bust was really to
113:52 - just a bust because we didn't have the
113:53 - pipeline we didn't have the
113:54 - infrastructure to really handle it and
113:56 - so didn't it it like the internet was
113:58 - around for so long but for businesses to
114:00 - really adapt and start using it which
114:02 - today you still have most businesses
114:04 - like most businesses don't even really
114:05 - have a personal website if anything you
114:07 - know they may have just something really
114:08 - really small and that's it uh and so
114:11 - that took like 25 years to really get
114:13 - integrated into society and so just
114:16 - apply that to AI let's just say the AI
114:18 - is incredible it's not it's like
114:20 - society's not changing tomorrow it's
114:22 - going to take a long time these big
114:24 - businesses these big corporations right
114:26 - now we're in the exploratory phase which
114:28 - is here's this thing that is just really
114:31 - you know like the culmination of the
114:33 - last uh 80 years of research into into
114:36 - AI in this one particular branch of uh
114:38 - multi-layer perceptrons or whatever you
114:40 - know whatever the llm underlying Tech is
114:43 - and here it is we have a business what
114:47 - happens if you start letting things be
114:48 - steered by this what are the
114:49 - consequences what kind of guidelines do
114:50 - you have to have what kind of this that
114:52 - you like think about the 9,000 questions
114:53 - that have to be set up for this to even
114:55 - become a business viable solution some
114:57 - people rushed in used it and then backed
114:59 - away you I mean how many stories have
115:01 - you read about like people going oh crap
115:02 - we overdid this one not a good plan and
115:05 - so they're all pulling things away and
115:06 - so that like that's just like the
115:08 - business learning phase and that's like
115:09 - a 10-year phase and then at some point
115:12 - it's going to be good enough to be
115:13 - integrated and we're going to start
115:14 - seeing it as a real part of our life so
115:16 - my guess is we still got like at least
115:17 - 10 years where things are going to be
115:18 - fairly the way they are today it'll just
115:20 - like slowly be going and then that's
115:22 - something point it's going to go from
115:23 - slow to fast and now it's everywhere uh
115:25 - so the next question is is what is it
115:27 - going to affect in my opinion and I
115:30 - don't think this is I don't think this
115:31 - is an opinion I think this is just a
115:32 - matter of fact if you ask the AI to do
115:36 - something it will do that something hey
115:39 - paint me a picture of a crab it produces
115:40 - you crab my counter question to you is
115:43 - why was that the right crab and you'll
115:45 - realize there's no reason why I couldn't
115:47 - have been one of 10 million other
115:49 - variations of the same crab it they crab
115:52 - is an archetype it can be visualized in
115:54 - a bajillion different ways but do the
115:58 - same thing with the AI and ask it hey
116:00 - give me a perfectly white
116:02 - canvas it's like just not going to do it
116:04 - you saw in the new uh jiid 4 Omni video
116:08 - uh the guy was just like hey girl and
116:10 - guy I want you to sing trading Lines by
116:13 - and they just didn't do it he's like no
116:14 - no no I want you to you sing one line
116:16 - and then he sings one line and then it
116:17 - didn't did it it's like no you got to
116:18 - stop at one line and you need to like
116:20 - the problem is again is that you went
116:22 - from an answer can be the answer to a
116:26 - specific answer is the answer and once
116:28 - you go from that that translation layer
116:31 - all of the sudden that's where the like
116:32 - AI completely fall off a perfectly white
116:36 - canvas is virtually impossible just like
116:37 - it is asking like there's that Meme
116:39 - that's going on the internet right now
116:40 - ask the AI ask chat chippity 4 40 the
116:44 - newest greatest most fantastic piece of
116:46 - technology ever how many ARS are in
116:48 - strawberry and what positions and it was
116:49 - coming up with the craziest answers even
116:52 - though it's like perfectly obvious to us
116:53 - because again you've gone from uh like a
116:56 - conceptual question like what could be
116:58 - the next thing that comes out to I want
117:00 - this precise thing and this is why we
117:03 - don't this is why you don't program in
117:05 - English you don't program in English
117:06 - because English is highly uh uh tolerant
117:09 - to like heirs I can like how I'm even
117:12 - describing this there's a thousand
117:14 - different ways I could have just said
117:15 - what I got done saying and all of those
117:18 - would have been acceptable English is
117:20 - just not a precise form of communic
117:22 - ation it's meant to go from thought to
117:24 - thought and the path we take is going to
117:26 - be some sort of you know version of our
117:29 - upbringing our culture all that kind of
117:30 - stuff and so now you're on to this idea
117:33 - of going from that language which is
117:34 - just terrible for specific uh or for
117:37 - specifications I.E read any legal
117:40 - document two like uh like this is a
117:44 - legal specification for what the AI
117:46 - needs to do and it just it utterly fails
117:48 - because it's not the right like that's
117:50 - not going to be it and so I'm not
117:52 - worried about this version of AI could
117:54 - there exist a future version in which
117:56 - can do all these things sure why not um
117:59 - but let me hit you with like a different
118:01 - idea yeah in the in the
118:04 - 2005 2003 to 2005 era you were going
118:07 - from a 1.3 MHz computer to like a 2 mahz
118:11 - computer the rate of change was
118:14 - incredible if you would have been living
118:17 - down that in that era which I was I
118:19 - thought man in 10 years I'm going to be
118:21 - using 10 10 GHz computers it's going to
118:24 - be crazy all these kind of things and
118:26 - guess what happened yeah it didn't yeah
118:31 - it didn't happen it did not happen
118:33 - because there is a fundamental
118:35 - diminishing return that exists out there
118:37 - and so like is this AI the worst version
118:39 - of AI we'll ever experience or is this
118:42 - AI actually in that Golden Era of growth
118:46 - where we're about to come up to a hard
118:47 - wall we actually don't know the answer
118:49 - to that and so if anyone tells you
118:52 - there's some future AI that's going to
118:53 - be magical and all
118:55 - powerful maybe we don't have any
118:57 - evidence of that ever being true in any
118:59 - other form of of creation right now like
119:03 - everything scales hor like the the
119:04 - economy of scale is never it just never
119:06 - goes that direction I would love it to
119:09 - be real but I don't see any evidence for
119:11 - it and so long story short should you be
119:15 - worried about the AI taking your job if
119:18 - you are a customer service
119:20 - representative in which your job is to
119:22 - take in a fundamentally flawed input
119:25 - match it against some sort of business
119:27 - requirements and then spit out another
119:29 - fundamentally flawed response to a
119:31 - person like yeah that's a very dangerous
119:33 - place to be if your job is to look at
119:36 - images like TSA looking at what could be
119:38 - dangerous and not dangerous in a
119:40 - backpack there very well could be a
119:42 - place where that starts to become a
119:43 - diminished return on that like there's
119:45 - these activities that you're just kind
119:47 - of like guessing and oh we need to check
119:49 - this backpack to see if it actually is
119:50 - bad or good like maybe that is maybe
119:53 - those type of positions will go away
119:55 - because you're just kind of it's kind of
119:56 - a guessing thing but at the end of the
119:58 - day anything that's like really concrete
120:00 - like I need to check the backpack now or
120:02 - hey I'm the doctor I'm going to review
120:03 - the MRI like those still have people
120:05 - behind them and programming is the like
120:08 - the Pinnacle of the world's most
120:11 - specific thing ever every single keyword
120:14 - every single symbol every single
120:16 - identifier has its exact position and
120:19 - its meaning and one has a consequence
120:21 - into the next one that's why it's just
120:23 - like such a disaster as these llms get
120:25 - longer and longer into stuff cuz the
120:27 - consequence of being mostly right
120:30 - compiles just horribly so even if they
120:32 - take that mostly right and you know are
120:33 - able to move it down to a thousandth of
120:35 - what it is today that's still completely
120:37 - wrong right there is no completely
120:40 - there's no mostly right in programming
120:41 - this is not horseshoes this is not hand
120:43 - grenades this is a precise mathematical
120:46 - expression of what your intent is so
120:48 - there you go so I think there's just no
120:50 - danger in this current world for or AI
120:52 - is taking your job if anything it's
120:54 - going to be the greatest uh I think the
120:56 - greatest amount of jobs will be created
120:57 - in the next 10 years in uh in general
120:59 - programming because of the amount of
121:02 - pure nonsense that is created I don't
121:03 - know if you saw the study I know I'm
121:04 - still going sorry I just have so much to
121:06 - say about this this is great but there's
121:08 - this study that rated or that that
121:10 - tracked the amount of lines changed in
121:12 - public op like open source repos in the
121:14 - last four years on GitHub and since the
121:16 - Advent of AI and its usage the amount of
121:20 - uh line changes not line additions not
121:22 - line deletions but lines in which were
121:25 - reworked has gone up from once every 6
121:28 - months on average to once every two
121:30 - weeks like the rate of change is just
121:35 - blowing out of the water things are just
121:37 - being changed so much faster now they
121:40 - can just be wildly changed now you could
121:42 - argue many reasons for that maybe in the
121:43 - next in the last couple years so many
121:45 - new people have gone in so they've kind
121:46 - of poisoned the well for like just
121:48 - constantly changing code and blah blah
121:49 - blah you could come up with a bunch of
121:50 - different potential answers but the rate
121:52 - of change either way is going a lot like
121:54 - how many times do you commit code and
121:56 - then have to rework code especially if
121:57 - it's I've been bit by chat chippity
121:59 - co-pilot so many times on generating
122:01 - code that I thought was correct because
122:03 - I didn't take the strong care to create
122:05 - it myself but instead just went that
122:07 - looks correct and then just got you know
122:09 - I lgmt that one or whatever it is looks
122:11 - good to me and just slapped that seal on
122:13 - these codes over and over again and Bam
122:15 - I've been hit with so many bugs because
122:16 - of that yeah all right I got a last
122:19 - question for you first of all I just
122:20 - want to say that like
122:22 - uh that is pretty much how I've been
122:23 - responding uh to people is just that
122:26 - like you're greatly overestimating what
122:28 - might come to pass and you're also
122:30 - overestimating how good these tools are
122:31 - today because they're not that great
122:33 - yeah right um precis they're great
122:35 - novelty like the fact that I predicted
122:37 - you had a tie game after you said Win
122:39 - Lose else and it's like tie you're like
122:42 - oh my goodness this thing's magical
122:44 - that's because no no autocompletes ever
122:46 - done that it was magical yeah it doesn't
122:47 - mean it's like it's actually good it's
122:50 - just magic it just feels magical Ian
122:51 - people were impressed with the lives of
122:53 - when it came out because it could keep a
122:55 - conversation going wow this great but
122:56 - but once you understand the trick and
122:58 - once you understand the trick about how
122:59 - these llms work it does kind of like
123:02 - you're like okay it's doing good but
123:04 - like this is nowhere near ready for
123:06 - prime time no pun intended there all
123:09 - right so last question so if people
123:11 - shouldn't be you
123:13 - know getting uh co-pilot integrated into
123:16 - their workflow if they shouldn't be like
123:18 - just you know relying on these tools and
123:21 - assuming that these tools are going to
123:22 - be able to deliver them uh from you know
123:25 - the drudgery of having to like manually
123:27 - code things themselves what are the
123:29 - fundamentals that you think people
123:30 - should prioritize let's say like people
123:32 - who are you know undergraduate studying
123:34 - computer science or people that are
123:36 - transitioning into Tech from other
123:37 - careers like accounting or truck driving
123:39 - or something like that like what are the
123:42 - skills that you would encourage people
123:43 - to prioritize investing their time into
123:46 - right now well so there's kind of a
123:48 - couple things there one what should you
123:51 - learn is a is a hard question and that
123:53 - really depends on you what you're
123:54 - interested in uh for me the biggest
123:56 - thing that I say is the same thing I say
123:57 - about working out what's the workout
123:59 - that's going to make you do that workout
124:00 - that tomorrow you're going to do another
124:02 - workout that's much better than the
124:04 - world's most perfect wellth thought
124:05 - through workout because if the the
124:07 - world's most perfect wellth thought
124:08 - through workout isn't the workout that's
124:10 - going to make you come back then don't
124:12 - do that one what's the one that's going
124:13 - to make you come back because your
124:14 - biggest like the biggest Ally to you
124:16 - today will be just time in the saddle
124:18 - time in the saddle is your like greatest
124:20 - indicator for you becoming successful at
124:22 - something just do it right now right you
124:25 - don't you don't know what you like you
124:26 - don't know what you don't like so build
124:28 - stuff read stuff read you know like
124:30 - there's algorithms courses I'm sure free
124:32 - code Camp has some algorithms courses
124:34 - learn a little bit of data structures
124:35 - learn a little bit about networks go
124:37 - learn about HTP servers go learn about
124:38 - the front end go learn about the back
124:40 - end go learn about embedded why not
124:42 - right why don't you get thorsten Balls
124:44 - book uh what's it called uh in The
124:45 - Interpreter p.com go if you're
124:48 - interested in how interpreters work like
124:49 - how does JavaScript actually run that's
124:51 - a very easy book to get into like just
124:53 - like these kind of simple things that
124:55 - just simply open your eyes and you go
124:57 - through the process of building cuz
124:58 - that's like that's like your first few
125:00 - years right if you want to be useful at
125:03 - programming that should be your first 10
125:06 - years right and I know that's that
125:08 - sounds horrible but like there is no six
125:10 - I don't believe there is a six-month
125:12 - path to becoming some six-figure job
125:14 - like I know that may have existed at one
125:16 - point during Co but that's because I
125:18 - mean we went from you don't have to be
125:20 - on the internet to like oh my goodness
125:21 - for the next year you have to be on the
125:23 - internet like obviously that kind of
125:25 - changed the demand and need for people
125:26 - to build stuff and some budgets got
125:28 - really blown out to the point where you
125:30 - could have that happen so yeah there was
125:31 - a time period where that may have
125:32 - happened but that is not the normal that
125:34 - should never be your expectation it
125:36 - should be a marathon it should not be a
125:38 - Sprint amen well it's been an absolute
125:41 - pleasure having you on the free cam
125:43 - podcast Prime and uh yeah I'm going to
125:46 - include links to a lot of cool primagen
125:49 - stuff like your YouTube channels
125:51 - anything you think I should uh if
125:52 - there's like a particular video that you
125:54 - think be helpful for people I can link
125:55 - to it and I just want to thank you again
125:57 - for coming here everybody who uh listen
126:00 - this far into the conversation I hope
126:01 - you have a fantastic week until next
126:03 - week happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

I mean how much do you feel like you're just like falling back on your instincts that are honed over the years I rarely rarely really think welcome back to the free Cod Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of free Cod camp c.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people in Tech this week we are talking with the primagen he is a software engineer he worked at Netflix up until recently for quite a while and now he's focused fulltime on streaming live streaming coding on Twitch and on other places and just you know talking about coding showcasing his skills welcome man how's it going it's going well how are are you I'm doing fantastic man it's great to talk to you uh I am a longtime viewer of your YouTube videos like I don't watch Twitch because I like to do everything at Double speed but I've enjoyed some of your takes over the years uh especially on the AI related things yeah okay okay I I feel like I personally have great takes on AI yeah well we're going to talk about some of those first though a lot of the people listening to this may not uh even though you have have a huge audience like right before you were streaming this I I went over to Twitch and I saw that you had like more than a thousand people watching you uh working on some different projects and uh yeah yeah like a lot of people obviously know who you are you're a big deal in the programmer space but uh a lot of people in the free Cod Camp community may not yet know who you are so uh one of the things I like to do whenever I have somebody on is kind of go back and do their programmer origin story uh and kind of get that out of the way before we launch into the many many questions I have prepared for you so yeah maybe you could tell us a little bit about like who you were as a kid and who you looked up to uh as far as looking up to uh I'm going to I I I have a stack brain so I just order I answer things in Reverse so just be prepared for that so if you ask more than one question you will get a reversal uh so as far as people who I looked up to Jim Carrey was probably my number one person that I looked up to uh Jim Carrey was absolutely uh just the coolest as far as like what did I did as a kid you know I I think my biggest claim to fame my biggest accomplishment is when I was somewhere between the ages of three and four I beat Super Mario I was really really into playing NES I just was something that from a very young age just spoke to me I I could not I could in fact beat level uh level three of battle toads the classic one that people can beat the Speeder Bike one yeah the SP the speed yeah the scooters where you jump on there and you go back and forth and you go yeah I could I could beat that at a very young age right when it came out I could beat right away and fun story here I I got all the way up to level seven vul Meers Inferno if I'm not mistaken and I was like oh man that was so hard and I was like five or six years old at that time and I just couldn't beat it and then at 21 years old I bought an NES and I bought battle toades and I'm like I'm older I'm faster I'm Wiser I'm everything here we go got to level eight and I was just like oh my goodness this game is so hard and eventually I got pretty good at it so I could speedrun it I I I was able to beat in about 36 minutes I think was beat the entire game in 36 minutes that I mean did you use like the level three warp there's like a special go the way through oh so no wall yeah there's a bunch of walls so on like level level one if you if you headbutt the first two guys you drop down headbutt go to the next one headbutt jump to the next scene you'll go to a level three on level three I think on the 10th gravestone on the very very fast ending part you'll hit a warp to a level five on level five I want to I I want to say there isn't a uh warp you just had to go through and serve but on level six the snake level there's actually one if on the second snake room if you sprint off the moment this the first snake turns and becomes flat you'll actually run through fall through a bunch of Pokey things and not actually hit any of them and land right into a warp interesting you go all the way up to level eight and so level Eight's about as far as as I know where the warps are I've never actually looked up any of these things I just kind of discovered them all as someone who was just trying to get really fast at the game yeah I mean that game is notorious for just its ridiculous difficulty and like the spike and difficulty it was so inconsistent because level one and level two were not that hard then all of a sudden you get to the speed thing and it's just like as a kid I got really frustrated I paid like you know six bucks which back in like 1980s was like 10 bucks 15 bucks uh and uh rented that game and I was like all right I'm gonna have a great weekend I'm gonna beat this game that because I beat every other ANS game that I rented right but no that speed bike thing I I was banging my head against and I can't remember if there even continues in the game but basically you just run out of lives and you're just like damn I have to yeah play level level one Lev there's no continue yeah yeah there's no safe spots there's no continues it's just it's just brutal that's that's how it works yeah they call it NES hard it's like Elden ring just without saving yeah yeah and Elden ring without saving would not be very fun there are people that can beat Elden ring without taking a hit or at least I'm not sure if it's for Elden ring but for the other Souls games yeah I've heard about this these no hit playthroughs of these of the Souls game I've never actually watched one or actually seen anyone do even part of it I never actually got into the souls game until as uh until Elden ring I didn't even know that was a category of games absolutely loved it speaks to my NES loving kind of nature it is a game that is just most certainly something that I love Challenge and difficulty and preciseness because there's something that's really pretty about preciseness you know uh you can't you can't be off by any amount it's just like you it's really like a very constrained way to do something but you can do it really fast which makes it fun yeah yeah I mean like eight frames to Parry uh in a lot of cases or if you have like the little Mitten you can Parry with like slightly more frames uh yeah I love uh I I did play Elder ring my kids love watching me play Elder ring uh but I just got I I couldn't I it took too long to figure out where I was supposed to go I like the Dark Souls 3 is my favorite of the souls games and it's because it's pretty clear where you need to go like the levels are pretty linear and it's all about like just getting from one place to the next and combat I encourage you to go back and try that if you haven't played Dark Souls 3 I've never tried it all I know is I've only played elen ring and when I played Elden ring I really just just had no idea where I was going it is extremely unclear what you have to do yeah and I think this part of they're trying to recreate that like old early computer game kind of like experience of just you know you've got this instruction manual that doesn't help all point is the game itself it's not to win it's to play the game yeah absolutely Dark Souls though uh I'm a huge fan of that series and uh of the designer and everything he's done to revitalize that kind of like Nintendo hard type uh to to frankly respect the audience and yes like it it does become an accessibility issue when you have people who have uh you know like motor uh skill impairments and other things and it's simply just not accessible to those people and he refuses adamantly to add like an easy mode to the game because he feels like that would compromise the Integrity of the game I mean the easy mode to the game is you go and you like Farm a whole bunch of XP and you become like overpowered at a lower level and then you can kind of like skate through some of the early encounters but I I definitely respect that philosophy and that commitment to look this game isn't for everybody yeah so I love it so playing a lot of really hard video games um looking up to Jim krey let's talk about Jim krey for a minute like that guy is super Innovative if you watch like the first Ace Ventura movie like all the different Impressions he's doing uh yeah yeah what was it about him that Drew you to him I don't know I'm just like every other kid I just thought he was hilarious he was fantastic Ace Venture or two when Nature Calls was like my favorite movie uh growing up all that kind of stuff so I know whatever that is it just was a natural thing the mask absolutely fantastic uh Ace furo one was fantastic the the tutu with with him dancing on the or getting freaked out by the bubble ramp like that's just it just it was all so fantastic yeah so you know I want to talk a little bit about your childhood and again I don't want to pry uh you know I came from like a family you know we were middle class and um I didn't have any early tragedies in my family uh but you know I'm trying to like figure out a way to put this but but like you lost your father at a pretty early age and you've talked about how that impacted you uh but could you talk about how that maybe like changed your trajectory like do you ever think of like a m Universe of like what you would be like like if I don't know if you watched Star Trek but like like the tapestry episode where uh Captain peard like sees what his life would have been like if these certain events hadn't happened and he's got this idealized version of his life and then he's got the real life where he ended up being the captain and that's the one that's you know marred with setbacks and bad judgment calls and all these other things that were just part of his exploration uh as a youth like would you would you be cool with talking about that a little bit yeah sure so what what is the specific question sorry there's a lot to it was it is it that I what would my life be like if it hadn't well yeah whether you think about that and you know maybe I do yeah I do do are you ready for an answer that might not be the answer you're ready for I am ready for anything man uh all right so have you ever read the book of the problem of Pain by CS Lewis I'm familiar with CS Lewis and his work uh I haven't read that specific book okay uh it's it's probably his most meaty book if if if meaty is the correct term for books and it in the very beginning it starts off with this idea where there's like there's various canards in in in a life where it's like is God so powerful that he himself can create a rock that he cannot lift right like it's it's it's it's stating a question which it's meant to be something you're supposed to think about blah blah blah blah and so when he talks about that he talks about this idea of impossibility so if something is impossible what it actually what what you're actually saying is that it is impossible suppressed Clause unless and then you change the situation uh meaning that it is impossible for me to see the road where I'm currently at unless if I were to leave the room I'm in and walk outside so that's called an impossibility it is impossible for me to see the road right now and so you have the suppressed Clause an intrinsic impossibility is something in which there is no time space actor or Universe in which The Impossible becomes possible there is no suppressed unlust Clause because it cannot exist and so I do not believe that there is any universe or uh time or situation that could have been conceived in some sense that would have changed the past or for me to understand what that you know what the outcome of that is and so I think of it more like an intrinsic impossibility so I don't actually think about what would my life be like if I were to have cuz it it changes it at such a fundamental level that there's no real point in thinking of it yeah and so that's kind of like my general answer of like what does it mean to have a dad that you know I can only answer in the in the affirmative of what does it mean not to have a dad growing up which you know there's there's a lot of difficulties I'd say uh one of the hardest things that ever came about was when I was I don't know I'd say I'd say it's like maybe 22 23 years old uh I used the term dad for the first time that I could conceivably remember that was strange right that's not a that's not a situation that a lot of people maybe can you know recognize but for me that was a very unusual thing uh I think having kids has allowed me to understand what it's like to have a dad so I don't get a dad but I can understand what it's like to have a dad and I can understand the importance of being a dad but I can never understand what it's like to have one I have no person in which I could feasibly have someone because whether you like it or not a mom is will never be a dad a dad will never be a mom a kid growing up really just needs this kind of dynamic duo uh my mom tried her best she did a great job doing as the best she could do but she could never be my dad and there's just something about that that has always been this like deep desire for me to have that side and I just never ever got it and that I know that it's missing and that's it and so I can't fill it I can just vicariously observe it in my kids yeah so yeah that's that's effectively my my life as growing up without it uh a lot of hard things transpired because of it but you know like I never had someone to tell me uh in in kind of the way I needed to hear it that I was being an idiot you know I never had someone that showed me how to do things in the way that I could I guess understand it yeah were you able to find any other like people in your life like teachers or other people that they could kind of serve even interraction of that role no uh my uncle uh physically abused me my other uncle was in prison so not not necessarily any male side in my life that you know was quality if you will yeah well what got you interested in computers um in terms of like like you got really early on you were you were interested in computer I'm laughing cuz that was just like such an intense 180 from where just going uh yeah I'm kind of thinking like like just just to articulate my thinking there cuz yeah I'm not like reading from a list of questions like that that is my NE next logical question because I don't know what else frankly there is to be said uh and you know I don't want to um denature what you just said by oh I'm sure everything worked out anyway and all that you know Jazz I I just want to like be because computers were a big part of your life from a very early on period from what I understand from listening to lots of interviews with you um and uh you know watching your channel and stuff and I mean was that was that an escape or was that just a way of channeling your energy like like cuz I mean it sounds like you grew up in a pretty you know adverse environment like despite the best efforts of your mom I would say that video games were more likely the Escape um Perhaps Perhaps programming in some sense was that as well um I didn't really grow up doing programming or anything like that I really enjoyed trying to install doom and get that done and be able to play Doom that was that was a great time uh there's all these like little things that I didn't quite understand that I just I very much so enjoyed uh about computers when I had a problem I I kept trying to figure it out and it was very frustrating and it'd be very upsetting but that's you know that was just part of part of life we just had a computer we had access to a computer really early on because before my dad passed he was doing a startup uh you know it's irony uh story at some point I'll I'll tell later about my first startup but for whatever reason uh he was just too early to uh to the startup he had you know if you remember 10 10220 dial down the middle I believe or whatever it was called Uh there's some like dial down phone card type longdistance situation he was doing in the late 80s early 90s which was just entirely too early for it to exist really cuz that didn't really come about until just a little bit later maybe like 5 years later that became a real thing people wanted cuz you know phones were a rarity in the late '90s early 2000s they weren't a common nearly as common as they are now yeah and so uh he we we just always had some access to a computer and so I was always able to play around on a computer and I played a lot of Mong tile and freei and all that stuff in Windows 31 you had to start up Doss and then in Doss you had the xq windows to get it to run and all that so had like some basic early experience with computers though I largely didn't understand anything it wasn't until there's this video game called Grail or growl I'm not really sure g r a a l and sorry and with it they had a level editor and I started playing with the level editor and if you double click on an NPC it would actually load up some script like some sort of Grail script I think is what they call it uh NPC script not really sure but it was a c like syntax and so I was able to look at it and effectively figure out what it's trying to say and it's not I mean programming in itself if you're sufficiently motivated is not terribly hard to start figuring out uh if it's a simple enough script like Lua is a pretty simple enough script that I think you could eventually figure out everything about it and so it's it's it was something simpler than Lua very very unexpressive and so you could just I just started looking and understood if if statements and while loops and all that and yeah it was it was fun so that's kind of how that's like my early time into computers and so I just really enjoyed doing that building stuff yeah and L of Warcraft 2 level editor yeah so so you might be just programming kind of incidentally without even realizing you were programming with the higher objective of building a level or making you know NPCs do certain things uh you you kind of learn it in rout to the goal of developing levels is is that like something like that I just wanted to build stuff and so I could see I could build interactive things so I just I just played around and kept trying to build interactive things yeah right on yeah and my understanding is like a lot of people approach you know me and they're like hey does free C Camp have like a Lua course because like that's one of the easier like languages to learn and and like I don't know if it's used in Minecraft uh M Minecraft Roblox like a lot of believe it is used in Minecraft yeah a lot of these uh these games especially like massive online games uh seem to like get serve as a good Gateway for kids to get into programming right um and like I think yeah most most games use Lua because Lua is an incredibly easy embeddable language like even an experienced embeddable person could probably embed Lua uh the language like I've never embedded a single language in my lifetime I could probably do it in an afternoon or two yeah so I think that's why it largely works with a lot of game development and all that is just it's it's really simple like embedding V8 extremely difficult that might take me a year embedding Lua might take me a week yeah that's a good endorsement of Lua as like just like an accessible language people can add if they want to get like a community of creators around and when say creators not necessar like YouTube creators but like people just creating levels right um my kids love making Mario Maker levels for example um yeah how I don't want to like get too personal about your your kids but like how old are they uh 10 through three uh my daughter just turned three a couple days ago so 3 six uh 8 and 10 yeah so so they're probably in that age like do you allow them to play video games and stuff like a lot like we have a rule that we don't let our games on days but yeah yeah pretty much same thing we don't do uh weekday we try not to do too much they just turn into they turn into little uh I'm not sure what other term to use other than [ __ ] they just like turn they just like it's like when you give them too much sugar it's just emotionally brittle they become very emotionally brittle when you let them play too many video games just like if I veg out and do something and watch too much TV I find everything to be inconvenient it's the same thing except for I just have the emotional wherewithal to kind of you know push through it whereas they're still so young it's just it's very difficult for them to understand what it takes to live a regular life and so if you let them play too many video games obviously things kind of go off the rails and so yeah we we do some weekend time like we'll play fortnite the kids love playing fortnite with me so we'll all load up into fortnite and go run around shoot stuff and since they since it's largely like uh my 10yearold and my 8yearold and they're not that very good and you know I can I can play I used to I used to play a lot of fortnite you know and it's like now just a lot of bots are really bad people it'll be like I'll get like 25 kills in a game and I'm just like man this what it feels like to be like a pro fortnite player playing with regular people because it's just like so easy because it's probably all Bots yeah it's fun we like it yeah that's cool so uh video games have been a way for you to like kind of share your childhood passion with your kids it sounds like yeah I really play them though uh just because uh they you know they they became uh I'd say probably like a crutch or a coping mechanism and it's not that I explicitly was like a crutch or coping mechanism it's just that I just recognized uh if I wish to be be really good at programming or really good at anything or do anything in life I just kind of have to make time and most of life is a choice of what you I mean we are fortunate enough to live in a day and age in which there's a huge amount of selfdirection and so with that comes the both the joys and the Pains of saying yes to doing something that may not feel as good and saying no to something that feels as good in the moment yeah yeah I mean like I could just sit and spend the weekend on the couch watching Netflix for example example or I can go and like you know compose a new song or I can go uh make it to the gym or you know any number of things that yeah Advance me closer to my goals and yet we we live in an age when like literally every movie every song is like a few clicks away you know reddits an ALT tab way and you're suddenly like seeing interesting half photos and stuff like that so uh yeah like being able to manage yourself has become like a key skill if you want to achieve your goals and like I guess stand out from the other people that have I guess less impulse control I sure if that's like the right way of saying it but yeah I see what you're saying we I constantly say on the stream that uh people misde Define liberty or Freedom quite often which is that Liberty uh is the ability to do what you uh what you want or your higher will and we often we often find especially in our very you know quote unquote free world that we live in that we find we're often just subjugated to our lower will what feels good in the moment will you eat that extra cookie or will you say no because you want to get in shape right like what is which will wins well often you find that the lower will wins much much more than the higher will and so perfect Liberty is the ability to know and say what you want and actually act upon that and so if you want to like say you know you have a large programming audience or a large newer wanting to get into programming audience what is the answer do you say I want to learn programming therefore you learn programming or do you say I want to learn programming like I say I want to learn Chinese which is just like some fictional want that not actually materializes into anything yeah yeah you do you really want to learn Chinese or you just you said just an example I I say I want to learn another language but it's just like the reality is is I'm not going to learn another language you know I say I want to that's it I know I don't I don't I know I don't actually want to we do we do what either our higher or lower will wants us to do and right now all effort and everything is pointed towards either is making what I'm doing right now a success well this isn't like a philosophical podcast so I don't want to delve too deep into this but one question that like I like to ask people sometimes is like whether you think that people actually have potential do people have potential or are people currently realizing their potential can you can you can you say that I I I don't quite know what that means can you can you state in a different way sure so uh for example I I could I could say oh I you know I want to become a really good uh I want to get really good at um let's say like a contemporary language like a rust or something like that and uh oh it'd be great to be a rust player like a rust you know developer and uh oh I know I have kind of a loose idea of what I need to do I just need to sit down and do it so I have the potential to become a great rust developer but am I actually going to invest the time like is that potential actually like a latent property or is it just you know I could be spending my time right now learning rust you know there's a comprehensive rust course on free cooking there's probably lots of other comprehensive interactive rust courses out there that I I could go through and I could I could learn that skill uh do you do you feel like people actually have potential or are is everybody realizing their maximum potential right now unless they change the status quo somehow does that does that make sense I I not 100% I it doesn't make sense to me but I'm going to try to say it in my way and maybe you'll tell me how close I am are people actually living up to what they could live up to now or is it all just Whimsical ideas and we are really not quite being as great as we can yeah like do we just tell ourselves there's the potential there when really like we like the will to act I I apologize I'm doing a bad job of structuring this question but like the question has been posed to me hold on I'm looking up a quote uh let's see uh dang it I know that there's a really really uh give me just one second it's a it's a great quote um all right well I'll hold out for your Zinger here we go I bet you I got this one uh here we go here we go I think this is a pretty good one uh we are halfhearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite Joy is offered to us like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what it is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea we are far too easily pleased see us Lewis it's a great quote uh effectively how I read this is that we we we settle for significantly significantly less than we can actually achieve I think that that you can you can just you can count how many times in a day that you decided to take the easy dopamine fast route as opposed to uh doing something that's going to actually affect your life in a positive way yeah like how much time is spent scrolling Instagram scrolling Twitter watching just like you know cat videos they don't actually give you anything right there's nothing out of that I know people try to say oh it's how I relax um I somehow doubt that that's really how you relax I think it's just a trained uh mentality cuz I mean you're telling me that all of life and all of humanity never got the chance to relax like my my real thing is is that we've just built up patterns and habits that uh just numb us from the the reality and difficulties of life and we choose that over reality that's I mean I know that's a very intense statement and you said you're not a philosophical podcast but that's that's just kind of my you know just my kind of Take On The World Is that we just settle for we you know it's my I know we're going to get into AI but it's my biggest worry about AI which is AI is there as this infinite teaching well that can help you get from A to B and it is you know theoretically if you have the $40 a month $30 a month whatever it takes to do uh to have chat jity for Omni uh you have the ability to get all these great things and instead you're just going to ask it to solve all your problems you're not going to take the route of becoming some one better you're going to take the route of getting what you need answered you'll become more helpless not more Wise by the end of using AI yeah well we could actually we could absolutely extrapolate that out to other tools like you know Google search as opposed to back in the day knowledge was hard fought you know I'd go to the librarian and I'd have to explain something that librarian who has trained their entire life to to be able to to take my query and like figure out okay what what what is going to help this person and then or maybe sends me over to the doy Decimal System you know card files and I'm I'm looking I'm going through a bunch of old microfilm you know I'm like scouring for the the answer and it's it's hard to get the answer there when you know you can just go on Google and Google like your no matter how half hard your Google query is you are going to get some results right and it's easy to think like oh that was great I solved my problem Google just gave me what I needed right and AI is going to be perhaps even easier to get you know a serviceable solution but that's not really what you needed it's just what you told you yourself that you needed because you didn't want to burn the extra calories to do the extra work you didn't want to invest the extra time in doing like exhaustive research yeah no do you ever hear the story about how unbroken the book was uh written it turned into a movie as well it's the same lady who wrote SE biscuit if I'm not mistaken unbroken I'm not familiar with it it's a very great story about Louis Zamperini a World War II uh veteran who I believe is still alive to this day very very old fell at this point he's like 90 something years old um he got caught in uh Japan flying over the waters and he had to spend quite some time in a Japanese internment camp uh or labor camp or whatever they called it in Japan and uh he also was an Olympic hopeful he was someone that went out there and was I think he ran the 400 or something and he was he was likely slated to win the Olympics when he went and so he had his whole life ahead of him but he joined the military was going to do two years and then boom out comes World War II and all that and the story of the book goes that uh the lady I forget her name um gosh I I literally have no idea what her name is uh she is doing all this research for seab biscuit and she's just reading old newspapers and reading old newspaper she stumbles on this story that's like oh we found Louis Zamperini and we were able to rescue him from one of these Japanese Japanese camps and like that's it and she's like oh that's really interesting put a note on it went back there later ended up spending seven years to write this book it's like you know wild success but if you have the direct answers well this whole story goes to show that if you have the exact A to B there's so much stuff that you miss like the you know often the answer isn't just simply what you want to know it's like that act of Gathering it going through things and yes it's like way inefficient and yes it's not you know like you could certainly move faster if you could just get exactly what you wanted at that exact moment but moving faster isn't like the goal always you know like it can't always be the goal there's more to life than just moving fast yeah 100% and people can delude themselves into thinking oh I'm doing so much you know that's like the whole multitasking thing uh that's uh people like trying to pack their schedule with like tons of conversations like quick 20minute meetings with like all these different people and I'm sure you're familiar with this having worked in Tech versus like you know a substantial conversation and I would argue that this podcast even though hopefully we'll be able to talk for like 90 minutes or two hours or something like it's really just a a very brief conversation considering like if you consider like a lifelong friendship that you have with somebody and like the things you learn from them over a longer period of time and kind of the ongoing discussions and the ongoing themes the undercurrents in your friendship and and the the things you do together whe whether it's play together in a band whether you're working on a software uh project together in PA programing periodically like whatever it is like greatness takes time right that lady she needed to to spend seven years even after she like filed that note away like actually thoroughly researching it and then writing the book right um yeah and I do think that that is something that we could lose and I know I'm sting like an old man shaking his missed a cloud you know but like really like I do hope we there's a return to form and I hope that there are a lot of people who use these AI tools uh not as crutches but to to further deepen the research rather than just shorten the research process yeah yeah yeah I mean I think it's good I you know like I I realized because I tried to use chat Chad jity 4 for a long time to make it do all my python work because I just never liked python I'm not going to lie it's it's it's the true low codes solution is python uh just because you know people who don't like to code tend to code in Python and they are able to just get a lot done without actually becoming you know like fullblown software Engineers they're just like researchers that are just like oh gosh okay done right and so it's like I always looked at python as this language I just never wanted to invest a lot in and so I just tried to always get chat jippy to do it all for me by the way I call it Chad jippy it's just way easier than saying GPT and so jippy way easier and um so it sounds more like Jiminy Cricket or something something like that it sounds like a fun yeah it's just it's fun it's stupid sounding right like the whole point is that it's just dumb sounding and that's funny to me I don't I don't know maybe the Jim Cary days influenced me on this one but uh what I realized is that I was able to make it so far but at the end of the day I learned nothing about python I had nothing to show for my time and I did spend a decent amount of time coaxing it coercing it convincing it begging it to make the right stuff and I just realized that all I was doing was training myself how to provide input to make the AI solve the problem I was solving a problem just a different problem and I realized that if I could have gone back and I could have waved a magic wand I should have asked it how to do those step by step and then programmed it all myself and acquired that little bit of knowledge that would have probably been like three hours worth of work and then I would have been just so much faster I would have been able to move so much quicker and that would have probably paid out tfold but instead it paid out zero fold cuz I IED on it to solve my problems didn't use it as a platform of research yeah I mean like people who I guess get really good with tools but lack the fundamentals they're always kind of you know they can't ever really get leverage and like scale their output they're they're kind of limited by the I guess throughput of those tools and what those tools can do um and that's that's why like we we encourage people to really dive deep into the fundamentals and really learn math computer science Concepts you know take time to read Donald K and stuff like that if that's how you pronounce his last name and and you know I hope that doesn't sound too like uh High flute and heavyhanded like like you got to really put in your time uh but people are in a rush they've been told by the marketers like hey learn a code in nine weeks get a get a Fang job you know pay off your student debt from your degree that didn't you know help you pay off your student debt right and uh I guess I'm grateful that like there is kind of this Back to Basics movement and you're out there preaching uh for lack of a better word like it encouraging people to strengthen their fundamentals and you're introspecting you're talking about this experience that you had with uh you know using jid 4 uh to uh to be able to basically kind of like shortcut actually having to learn and put in the hard work and that you saw that darkness in yourself you saw that that antipattern like emerging do you think that do you think that everybody uh like like What proportion of people do you think Will Will just cave to that like do you think everybody has the capacity to step back and think like gee like I just took a bunch of shortcuts and and to introspect well enough that they realized that they didn't actually write that code that all they did was do a series of like naive prompts and GPT 4 was smart enough to kind of like fill in the blanks I I think people will always optimize to I in our society maybe maybe there's there exist different Societies in which you know I'm not a I'm not a cultural narcissist I do not believe that everyone behaves like we do and so I'm speaking from a very American perspective maybe broader you could broaden it out to the West perspective but that we will always do what is most efficient generally speaking so if I took a 100 people and I said hey you could a learn all these things solve the problem it'll take you one week or B hey you could prompt and you know get far enough and you could be done in two hours and you had a job and you had things to do and you had people to answer to you you just go okay well I just want to I just want to move on not that you actually you know you don't get the dividends you just get the paycheck and so I think we often trade dividends for paychecks and I I I've been trying to you know if you will the Renaissance of becoming a more learned man uh trying to slow things down and try to adopt a different culture which is that you know you you want to become the master of your craft I love I love those stories of these like that one dude from Norway who could roll steel so well that we it took us all the way until we had our fantastic Technologies just to be able to understand how he built these swords that were like unbreakable it's just like you know how he got that good he probably had some freak genetic gift but he also spent like 30 years making swords to the point where he could flick it listen to The Ring of it and be like this one's bad you like just like just understand deep down it's just such a hidden knowledge secret secret knowledge level like how to do things at just this beautiful level and like I want that I want that I I want the craft you know I want the craft for the sake of the craft I don't want the craft just to just to Simply have output because at the end of the day output works and it's great and I would say that output is much more entertaining slash driving for younger people I think when I was younger output was way more Chief the concern than the craft itself and as I've gotten older I find I find myself realizing that you know life is is just it has to be more than just productivity you know I want to wake up every day and even if I work on the worst things I want to enjoy it yeah yeah I mean like what you just said since we were talking about NES and like you know speedrunning and things like that your ability to speedrun battle toades in like 36 minutes there was this guy and you may already be familiar with this but there was this guy who would speedrun all these games back before speedrunning was really even a thing he submitted times and everything his name was Matt Turk and uh have you heard of this guy he had like records feel like I did watch the recent like big speed running thing of the origins of all the speedr running with Games Done Quick and all that I feel like that name was mentioned but I'm trying to like place it where it was it took people years to reproduce like deliberate like like speedrunners didn't understand how he was able to get these times but they eventually were able to like kind of reverse engineering he just got it and then he moved on to the next one and he was just obsessed with the craft he didn't even really care that much about the street credit or anything like that there's no Street credit to be gained I don't think he even like filmed his attempts or anything there was just a culture of like that seems like a really fast time but I guess it's realistic and then years later people were able to like gradually beat it but he he had so many records stand for so long and it was probably some freak combination of like natural aptitude and ability maybe he just had superhuman like uh attention to detail some sort of weird thick genetic cord down his spine that just like allowed super fast you know electricity flow yeah but but it's it's it's kind of the same thing it's like I I don't know if that even knows that people know who he is or care you know but he's just some Forum user from like you know 2006 or something like that playing Nintendo games that nobody even plays anymore back in back at that time uh and uh just the Romanticism like like it's very romantic the notion that this guy's just sitting there probably you know in the proverbial mom's basement like just getting really good at these games and like totally underappreciated but he appreciates himself he appreciates that he is getting these ridiculous times even though he's not even competing with anybody at this time cuz he's so far beyond the competition he's still competing with himself he's trying to like one up himself with each attempt and uh there's something really I don't know like like for me as you know a man and as somebody who like uh takes pride and what they do like there's something very romantic about that so yeah I used to do a a speedrun myself in Mario Kart the original one with Yoshi on Rainbow Road I don't remember my exact times but I know that I could hit every single corner I would drift across every single like it was perfect and we're drifting didn't give you a boost this is the OG I could play the entire thing perfect every single time and I forget the exact timings I was but it was just like awesome and I just loved it and I'd never fall off an edge it was just this idea of just doing the thing so well and then that one time you got lucky and you got a mushroom and on the back side of rainbow road you could hit the mushroom and take the jump across the entire Chasm it was just like that one run was just so much faster than all the rest the runs and it was just so cool but you had to get in all the other runs and like you know play the the you know random number generator game until you until you got in the position and you had to get your skills into the position to where you wouldn't choke the moment you got that mushroom and you would actually finish the run I choked many times because it was so exciting like I was like you know yeah well just keeping with like our general theme of chronology and uh like just to establish the primin origin story like so let's talk a little bit about like high school and college and like because you did ultimately go and study computer science and uh but when you went into like was your like high school guidance counselor like were people like yes this man is going to be a software engineer like what what did people think about you when you were in high school what what was your general vibe off well my teachers all but uh a couple very few um I think of Mr Patrick all the time if somehow Mr Patrick from Billings West High ever heard this a shout out to Mr Patrick great guy and if you know anyone in Billings you tell them to tell Mr Patrick if he's still around uh that he's the best but all the rest of the teachers um you know I was I was I probably wasn't the best student okay you know I there's this one teacher named Mrs be and she had 200 bears in her room and I may or may not have thrown one of or two of the Bears out the window you know I may or may not have gotten in in some decent trouble she handw wrote me a note telling uh telling me that I will never amount to anything in my life she literally like handw wrote you a not saying that the she she she took the time she took the the the time and the effort and the patience to really remind me that I am by far the worst person in the universe and so you know I was I was a shitthead granted I don't know if cursing is allowed on this I was a poop head I don't censor anything don't worry about it okay okay and so I I I agree I I I was not very nice uh but you know I wish I it would it would have more positive teacher been good for me maybe not you know maybe that was just what I needed I never hold on to things negatively and use that as motivation you know you hear Michael Jordan talking about that that he'd intentionally pick a fight with someone else on the opposite team because he needed that drive I don't I don't want to win because I can beat somebody else I want to win because I can be better than I am at this current moment right again the ghost running uh Super Mario uh gokart all that kind of stuff it's the Perpetual drive to win perfectionism maybe is the right term for it um and so yeah like high school I was definitely a disaster for sure uh College it extended into that disaster just worse and it took me three tries to get through college the third try is when I really took off you a lot of people put it into perspective um in my third try in college I had uh for calculus 4 differential equations usually we just call the calc 4 or dyq I had the highest grade on the final and I was the also the only student to finish the final and there was over 400 students so I think that was pretty good uh for Cal 2 I was the only I finished it in 30 minutes out of a twohour final and for Cal 1 it was like 20 minutes and I finished it I had a friend come up and said you finished it so fast that someone thought you just quit and then I also got the highest grades out of all those and so I was like really really good at math but what people don't know is that before that I failed precal three times and I went to the learn the Learning Center 4 hours a day for calculus one and it's just like that's the part that people don't recognize is that um I didn't get good or any of these things by uh it wasn't a natural born Talent or anything so going through high school and going through college it was a huge fight against myself I largely I was my own personal worst enemy for sure for a huge amount of it uh and I had a million and a half excuses everyone has an excuse I mean there's people that have worse lives than me there's people that have better lives than me but we all feel you know pain relatively we all have excuses for why it's unfair or uneven or you know any of those things but it's just like until I let go of all those things and just really went after it I was just such a disaster when it comes to all these things when you say let go of all these things like can you elaborate on that like like what were you like the the kind of Angry Young Man chip on his shoulder kind of like that that kind of archetype that you see when you see like the the cop dramas and stuff like that like were you were you like cuz cuz I was absolutely never been me okay so you weren't it was more just like I didn't care okay so it was apathy it was like you like nihilistic or like what was going on I you know like I was I was a drug addict that wasn't a drug addict yet right I I just wanted to feel something uh and it and and and school was not it right longterm the dividend play was never it so I'd much rather have drank or chased girls or smoked pot done something like that does anything to like try to feel something largely into porn I saw porn for the first time when I was four years old and so that was always been a huge struggle for a large portion of my life I haven't looked at porn in 15 plus years 18 years I have no idea how long but it's been a long long time yeah and and so in this you because you didn't feel anything like again I'm not like a therapist or a psychiatrist or anything like that but I'm just trying to make sense of this like uh as as like we can RI I don't hold you to Scientific standards don't worry Okay cool so so I mean were you just kind of apathetic as far as like academics and stuff you're just like H I kind of suck at math whatever like were you resigned to just sucking at math no it's not that I was resigned sucking at math I was just resigned to not try yeah and so what changed what was it the snap because you put in the time right you went to the Learning Center which is kind of a humiliating thing like I'm not good enough at this I have to ask for help right like like what was it that I guess inspired did did the school compel you to go to the learn Center for like 4 hours a day and get tutor I mean that's a lot of resources you know math tutors like like having somebody teach you oneonone was it oneonone instruction oneonone or one on two yeah there's always a math there's always open seats at a math learning center very few people ever take advantage of it ntas are required like people get their college paid for by volunteering or spending all their time it's not really volunteering if you're getting paid to do it or your college paid for they they they make that tradeoff they pay their time for uh for being able to go to college or get their masters or get doctorates and so there's always was seats available so I always had there was never like me waiting for somebody um and so it was just it was just that I just had to put in the time as far as the things that kind of uh like transpired to that it was it was my second go round of college and I became a late Life Christian and I kind of changed like my whole life changed on a dime on a single evening uh never really had any of that um wasn't planning on having any of that and unlike all these fancy stories where people say how their whole life changed and all that the only thing I gained was a conscious and all of a sudden I couldn't like I couldn't do things that I used to do so I if I watched porn I felt bad about it never felt bad in my lifetime all sudden I feel bad about it if I smoked pot I felt bad about it if I drank I felt bad about it I was like what is going on with my life and so it's just like just everything changed and so then it's just like me I I was the most reluctant person becoming a normal contributing citizen I think of all time it's just like I it just every single step of the way I hated it and it's was just like oh man absolutely just the worst just teeth pulling the whole way yeah can you talk about that like that moment of like just hearing a conscious like was it like a voice in your head or was it just a vibe in your gut like I shouldn't be doing this yeah more vibe in the gut probably than anything else you know however that happens where I you know I don't I don't pretend to know any of these things because obviously it's not like I was a well researched person I wasn't I wasn't you know this was not an intellectual exercise that led me to a be this was a very sharp moment that I just felt like uh the the reality of all decisions I've ever made compounded plus like the reality of all future decisions I will make if you were to travel back to that moment you remember the specific Moment Like were you just sitting on the couch like and it just hit you or you know it's a largely it's a personal moment I'm going to I'll keep that to me but it was just yeah it was just it was just a very intense thing and that's all I remember is just being so um compelled to do something that's it like that's why I just say like holy cow is this is this what Experiencing God is like I have no idea because it was vastly like if my realm of experience was this circle it was somewhere way far out on the outside so I was like this is vastly different than all things in my entire lifetime and so therefore I'm going to have to I I it would be a fool of me not to respond and So I responded right and that's that was what led me down the path of being changed where I was fine doing work it's like all a sudden it also unlocked one thing I could I could learn I could I could now not look at school as a complete disaster yeah and what happened from there I mean it sounds like you like frankly it sounds like you were a new man like like it had a dramatic Sudden Impact on your academics on how you manage your time on how you managed your own behavior and like impulses and things like that yeah it it took a long time for me to catch up you know like often I think we all experience this where our heart will move but our actions aren't representing how we feel like I think we've all had these kind of things where you know like take any person that's not in shape but they've all of a sudden they really want to get in shape like their heart has moved and they now feel bad because they know that they didn't do what they thought they should have done right like and so that's kind of like what happened in my life and this this distance took three years for it to close and so it was a long time but it was just like I knew that I didn't like where I was yeah so so like that's I didn't want I didn't want to be addicted to porn or drugs or any of those things like I wanted a life that was meaningful and good and I could actually you know I I could actually one day have a wife and kids and and not give them the same curse that I was given at a young age like how do how do I how do I give something better than what I had yeah and you know to fast forward a little bit you like you have a wife and kids uh you have been able to to find success and it doesn't sound like much of this would have materialized if you just stayed doing what you were doing uh do you ever think about like how like if you could I often I often think like like I I had some pretty dire times like I had a big falling out with my parents I spent like a year sleeping in my car at the Walmart where you can fun fact you yeah Walmart will generally not call the cops on you if you're sleeping in their parking lot they they have kind of like a unspoken rule that you know PE people who are between places to live can like sleep in their car there um and you know hospitals and other places like that are generally pretty understanding so yeah like like I kind of went through a period like that too where I you know dropped out of high school and just spent like a my entire teenage time doing a lot of things that I'm not like super proud of not it's not that I'm not proud of them but it was just like looking back I just I feel guilty that I squandered so much of that time and energy that I could have spent you know reading or learning um and eventually I was able to you know go to state school and and get my degree and everything like that but I always felt like that there there was the Lost Years so to speak um and I always wish that like have you I talked about Star Trek earlier I'm going to talk about it now there's this one episode of start Trek the Next Generation where they're trapped in like a Mobius like a loop of time and uh data and Captain rer figure out this way that they can communicate and send information back to themselves so that they can change some sort of like thing because the ship's going to blow up if they don't do something different than what they've been doing over and over the ship I saw that I saw all the episodes but I can't remember that many of them but I I feel like I remember that one there's another movie called arc on Netflix that is effectively the same thing okay cool and and so anyway they figure out this way that they can like basically use you know Tech as the writers refer to it like neutrinos or something like that that they could send like a few bits of information back and all they could do was send they sent like something in data is like you know AI powered mind like he could actually perceive these and it would like flip a bit or something like that and he would be aware of it and they could only send like I think he sent back like the number three or something like that right um and that's it so again I don't want to spoil this episode but I often wish that I could send something back to myself when I was sleeping in my car at Walmart just like if I could just send back two letters or something so that I could have some sort of Hope because I felt really hopeless I felt really nihilistic I genuinely didn't think that I would live into my 20s I just figured like a lot of my friends died you know like suicide uh other things like that and I just didn't see a feature for myself and I wish that I could send back the letters okay or something like that just to just so I would be like oh there's hope for me you know did you feel any sort of hope uh and and do you wish you could send hope back or do you think that if you sent hope back that would corrupt you somehow and like potentially ruin the process like would you would you trade what you went through um I would never trade what I went through I hold no resentment uh towards anyone or anything um no I would never I would never trade what I had because if I would have traded what what I had I have you know again I I if I could make myself feel better I would have not probably had the same life change event I would have artificially felt better about myself that would not have CED anything that would not have changed anything fundamentally with in me like it took a hard time to make a different person and like there's that there's that old phrase right it goes something along the lines of like hard times make good men good men make easy times easy times make bad men bad men make hard times some some some I forget it's an old phrase it goes something along those lines it's just like I had to have that same internal small cycle where it's like in if I didn't have the bad I don't think I could have had the good yeah awesome well um you know it's it's like the uh you know you always see these like there's there's a lot of these stories that exist where the person that was the the ultimate bad guy whatever it was they're doing something and they're fighting you know the the good guy this happens in chess as well you give up something that looks so high value in the moment but you win in the end because you're able like the person doesn't realize that though they're making the most winning best move in the moment like the thing that they're losing is actually the game and so like it's that greater thing where it's just like I wouldn't want to do that cuz I don't know how the chess pieces would have fallen out to make that better to make a better analogy there which is like I I'm glad that I had to give up the queen yeah yeah like Bobby Fisher sacrificing like almost all his pieces in order to like is that the immortal game yeah I think it's the The Immortal game I think refers to a different game but it it okay it's like they lose every last piece except for two and then win the game like the greatest the greatest bamboozling of all time yeah but it's just like like seeing that line and committing to it and being willing to go through all that pain for what you believe is a good outcome cuz I mean you your judgment could be wrong or your opponent could do something that is like maybe they see that oh he keeps sacrificing high value pieces he's trying to bait me into something but but like can you maybe they're not as greedy as you think they are um but um yeah I see what you're I see what you're saying um and I I think sacrifice let's let's talk a little bit about sacrifice CU you put a ton of time and energy into your skills over the years um you've put a ton of time and energy into optimizing different aspects of you know just being a developer uh and and we can geek out on a lot of the different tools and techniques you use and things like that and I would love to do that if you if you are interested in talking about that yeah but like well first I got to I got to do the philosophical side of why yeah working hard and all these things are good so you hear this phrase a lot which is work smart not hard and so this is where I call absolute [ __ ] on that phrase because when you don't know what smart is there's only one way to get it which is by working hard and so the smart way to work when you don't know what you're doing is to work hard because there you know if let's just say that it's going to take you roughly 10,000 hours of good focused time to become great at programming and after you've worked say x amount of hour your focus time kind of reduces by 10 15% some some amount that you're just not as good you're still getting closer every hour that you're you're you're putting effort and time into and you know if someone's working say 80 hours a week and someone's working 40 hours a week and you compare them in two years like I would take the BET blindfolded and spun around in circles every single time that the person that did 80 hours is in a significantly different position than the person that did 40 hours like it doesn't matter how smart that 40 hour person worked it's just sometimes time wins every time time like that's that was that was a very 60% of the time it wins every time phrase but it was like time wins time wins every time right the person that's just willing to do the most will always win that's why you see the stories about like Kobe Kobe was the first person in the gym last person out of the gym you're telling me that there wasn't times he didn't feel it didn't want to do it it was too ouchy things were hurting probably should have taken a break no it's just that laser focus to do something great but not everybody needs to be Kobe not everybody wants to be Kobe and that's okay you first determine where you want to be and then you set in motion the steps you need to take to get to that position and if Kobe's the goal be the first person in be the last person out yeah if Kobe's not the goal then you know adjust accordingly and that's something I'd also like to talk with you about because freeo camp like I worked I mean there were probably literally weeks uh where I was working like more than 100 hours uh maybe even like 120 hours early on trying to get this open source project off the ground and stuff and uh of course like you in my humble opinion it's bad management to expect your charges to do that like I absolutely advocate for I'm on your team 100% with that but as a founder or as somebody who's trying to like I mean you could be considered a founder of the primagen like Persona the the stream like everything you've built right like that took probably an incredible amount of work it sounds like uh I mean where do you kind of draw the line like between believing that work life balance is important and yet seeing that your own success probably would not have happened if you were trying to work life balance your way or do you believe that do you believe that you could have gotten where you were if you didn't I call it the TRU like because I don't like the term gatekeeping I don't know if you've ever heard any of my rants about it 90 99% of what people say is gatekeeping isn't gatekeeping it's just someone being mean on the internet but I'd say one of the most actual gatekeeping things you can ever see are these people who've achieved a lot in programming and they achieved it VI via like working to death and doing these things tell everybody how important work life balances and that you shouldn't do that and don't do that what they've done is they've sold you a bill of goods that they themselves didn't follow and they themselves didn't use to achieve what they achieved and then tell you you shouldn't do that like is Success only relegated for them that's how I kind of take these type of phrases it's like there's a good kind of thing you can say and then there's a bad kind of thing you can say saying you should never do that that's probably not the right phrase saying hey you know you got to know when the tradeoffs are and you got to be able to make the right decisions and at some points in your life it is good to do something that's probably unhealthy for a short period of time like that's okay if you're a founder and you want your company to be a success well there's only one choice you have to make you just got to have more hours in like that's that's just going to ultimately make it potentially more successful and it's not like it's good I don't recommend anyone doing a 100 hours worth of work a week like that's just not healthy like it's not physically healthy spiritually or emotionally healthy but if I had to do it for six months I would do it for six months not that I want to it's just a kind of like a a willingness to do that uh as far as like work life balance stuff goes and all that how I think about it is that I see it all I I do see this quite frequently people talk about how important that is but when it comes to actual life balance they're around their kids they're around their wife they're around their husband they're around family moms whatever but their brain is completely somewhere else they're not they're not in it and so it's just like that's not work life balance yeah you're just somewhere else like that that how does that count and so it's like if you're going to do something you should just do it you should just do it well and so when I go home I turn off my work brain and I can just do that and it's it's a skill I've been practicing it it wasn't just something that immediately you know popped out of nowhere it was something that took effort and effort and effort and how I typically go about it is it's the same thing when you're at work and you get distracted you will never be able to take away distractions but you will be able to respond to a distraction when you realize you're distracted to respond in the positive that is your chance uh you know I have had different phrases my life to describe it but that's how I think about it now which is that you can't control the distraction you can control how you respond when you realize and so when I'm with my kids that time to realize I'm being distracted has just gotten smaller and smaller and smaller because I actively fight against it the moment I realize I'm not doing something I don't finish the thought I don't keep on thinking about be like oh I should really do this but hold on you know okay well what about no no no cut it off the end move on back in you know oh I don't I really don't feel like getting up I really don't feel like crawling on the ground I really don't feel like caring my kids you know what shut up you're going to do it cuz it means way more to them and it really doesn't feel that bad I'm willing to lift weights I could be willing to crawl on the ground yeah you know it's just like that willingness that desire to like not listen to the thing that says don't do it but listen to the thing that says this is going to be like I'm in the moment so when I'm programming I want gosh darn it I want to be programming and when I'm with my kids gosh darn it I want to be with my kids yeah do you do you find that they ever like bleed into one another like like I mean do you work at home or do you have like a you know some sort of bar that I converted yeah I have a horse barn that I converted that is you can walk across your property to your studio essentially yeah yeah yeah yeah but I do have a physical barrier which I think does help a physical barrier does help uh uh you know I if you have some form of of routine I think routine helps a lot because then you can build that muscle via routine to like stop doing something you know like that's just pract more practical tips you know so if you if you get off of work get off work at the same time every day you know don't you sometimes you can't control when you start work but you can always control when you stop and you just force yourself to stop and it's just like I I always say the same thing with sleep if you want to get a good sleep schedule you don't control when you go to bed you control when you wake up your body will eventually say uncle and will start we we'll fall in line but there will be a time of period where it's very uncomfortable but you kind of forced yourself into a new schedule 500 is when I'm going to wake up like sorry me who stayed up till midnight last night man this sucks but I'm going to drink 14 cups of coffee and just call it a day until I can like make myself fall into line and so that's kind of like the ideas that I I generally float around with is just creating strong um routines and so I get off at 4 I get up I try to get up at 5 and I go straight to work I like make coffee and go straight to work I don't do a morning routine there's no red light therapy cold plunge hot plunge all that kind of stuff just bam straight to work right and just go right into it because that's the only way I can get in the hours I want yeah the best thing I ever did for my sleep schedule was have kids cuz my kids wake up at 7 o' no matter what sometimes 630 yeah and eventually you will fall into line like you I mean you you most certainly experienced this you probably were a night outl I'm a light I'm a natural night out I'd rather program at 1 in the morning than 1 in the afternoon and it's just like a natural part of me but it's just like you know I just fought it and changed it because life circumstances forced it and so then I just leaned in yeah so let's talk a little I mean we we could go through the whole like your entire developer origin story but like frankly I'm more interested in just gleaning like insight and sharing them with you because you're prolific man like I'm I'm sure you're aware of this but like you stream a ton you have like three YouTube channels where you're publishing stuff you you are constantly posting on Twitter uh and other probably other social media as well and uh and you're building like substantial you're like not just on the stream like let's chat you're actually building things and uh you know maning theow of and responding intelligently while you're also holding a of in your head when you're cing like I want to get I don't want this to turn devolve into like productivity bullet points or anything like that but but like if you want to learn a little bit more about your process if if that's cool um and maybe you could walk me through like a typical day like do you know when you're sitting down what you're going to do that day like you you get your coffee it's 500 a.m. you're walking you live in uh like a pretty cold part of North America right like yeah yeah I live in South Dakota so it's cold it also is hot during the summer colder than here in Texas very variable yeah so you're like trudging through I mean Texas potentially to this horse barn and you're sitting down I hope you have insulation in there you have insulation you have a space heater how how do you stay warm I I do have I have a mini split that I put up there that was like the most expensive part of this it was Framing and the mini split that were the two big ones and so yeah so this is paint that's like a literal pain wall you're not using like the flimsy green screen never aink I got a green room unironically Green Room yeah so so like let's talk about like okay 500 a.m. like put us in the shoes of the primagen as he's sipping his coffee oh wow yeah so it's like it's like it's a real it's a real green room and then of course there's the camera the ring light there's a bunch of yeah there's a bunch of foam fil all over the place like if I go on that side the the next season of the Mandalorian could be filmed right there in your Horse bar it could be yeah this is L literally A Horse bar and two stalls very cool so like what is your day like like you got the you got the coffee you're walking out there you're sitting down what happens walk us through it uh I generally come in with a very very uh I know that I'm going to program I know I'm going to do something and that's typically how I start like I I have a project that I've been building and that project is fairly complex or fairly Technical and I know that if I just sit down I'll just you know I'm it will come back to me all the things I need to learn so sometimes you know as I BS or talk with people I'm I'm in my back brain going okay what was the last thing I did okay I remember all this stuff all right now I know what I need to do like I have five things that I know I need to do to put this what I'm working on on the Shelf I just don't remember right now that there what the five things are I'm sure I could like derive them if I just rewalk the path but we'll start later and I'll start figuring out things and get it done well tell us a little bit about your frame of like what you experience as somebody who has a thousand people watching you on Twitch and like rapidly typing you know comments and what it's like to watch that that all that stream by knowing that you got to keep the show going this is live uh yeah like like what is what does it feel like um you know it's shockingly it doesn't feel much different than when I had 30 people watching me or 20 people uh when I started uh programming on Twitch uh a big stream was like 30 people that was like amazing and so it's like yeah it's changed quite a bit but it's it's still the same thing I'm still just trying to build something that's ridiculous I don't have like you know I don't have just some you know a lot of people you you'll see a lot of people with these things where they have all these um they have all these tips and like oh man such good marketing ideas and oh you know you got to send it at this time of the day to do these kind of things and oh you want to talk about this at this time and I just have I have no I have literally no plans so you're just relying on your ability to perform in the moment essentially like uh it's a it's a performance essentially there there's not like a whole lot of yeah systems in place to like help you uh like like perhaps like a less interesting streamer would just have gimmicks or something like oh let's go to dumb human dumb pet tricks or something like that or whatever it would be like different segments or thing do do you do anything like that or is it like and I'll be completely can I've never sat down and like actually watched one of your streams I just watch YouTube and I watch it like double speed and I usually watch it while I'm doing something else like not to denigrate your art or anything like that but uh what would a typical flow be like for somebody who's never watched uh you stream before it just depends on the day so I either do a heavy programming day days or we do like article style days and all that and so these are the heavy you know like today was a heavy programming day so for five six hours we just wrote go code uh wrote All of Huffman encoding for stuff and I could do you know various value size and all that for Huffman en coding and then we ended up beating gzip for this kind of realtime rendering engine that I'm doing right now and so that was fantastic I was very very happy about that but that was today and so that was the plan I knew I wanted to get far into the Huffman thing didn't think I was going to put a bow on it but hey we put a bow on it and so now it's done now I get to move on to the next thing quad trees uh I have a theory that if you break up the screen into various regions those regions change less than if you try to do the entire screen at once for encoding and so obviously this all this stuff has been done before but I'm just doing it myself and I'm doing it all myself and I'm going to make a you know little fun engine for game stuff and so yeah that's that's the next thing I'll do and and like pardon me if if I'm asking kind of really l l question but essentially just more efficient impression is what you're after yeah yeah then yeah so it's the idea is that I'm rendering in the browser using Dom elements and so everything is rendered on the server and all finished and just on the uh just in the browser do you see the result and that's it and so it's kind of like web RTC or something like that but it's it's just with asky so it's all asky games that's part of the fun I wanted to make them all asky and so it's all browser based asky stuff so it's just like minimizing how much data you send down yeah yeah that's really cool so like uh Dwarf Fortress type games or I mean would that be a representative of the type of games you're developing are you a dwarf well the first one I'm doing is uh I'm I'm I'm encoding Doom okay and we're going to play Doom so that way everyone in chat can play Doom at the same time so instead of having doom on the most bizarre device I want to have 2,000 people play Doom at the same time yeah that's a novel approach instead of running having it running on a pregnancy test you're having a whole bunch of people running on you know twitch is like Twitch Plays Pokemon I think was like an experiment that first one the problem is latency latency sucks right yeah and like turn kind of Doom is very instantaneous like you have to be quickly moving around if you're not going to get slaughtered by these demons right precisely hence the reason why you have to have why I'm building all this realtime stuff is that I want someone to be able to open up a web browser and I'll be shooting up from my computer up into some fly iio noes or something like that and then it will display what's on my computer within like 500 milliseconds see there's some there's some like latency that you could have that's fine it's just that anything beyond that it becomes you know it becomes untenable so if they press in chat and chat takes 200 milliseconds to get to my computer plus you know or 300 or 400 or 500 milliseconds Plus for them to see what they're seeing is you know 400 milliseconds behind that still actually largely works because Doom is such a simple game you don't need to be precise you just need to like like shoot in the Demon's general direction and you hit it so you know there there's a lot of forgiveness in the game this isn't fortnite this is yeah so you're a lot of people are going to be using the double barrel shotgun if they're going to have any success I would imagine um yeah yeah yeah you can select Guns by just selecting a different gun yeah and twitch itself has like a good amount of latency like like several seconds so like if they're looking at the actual twitch stream then what has happened in the game has already moved on like a couple seconds before they their input actually quite a bit so how do you address that is there a way to address that that's why I'm doing the whole Real Time stuff is that they're going to open up a website ah so you're not going to rely on what's on my computer within a few hundred milliseconds and if I really felt like I could shave off another 150 or whatever it is my my guess is my guess is that a lot of my ping up to these servers is like 40 50 milliseconds so it's it's not like terrible and so for me to send up this data and then just have it routed back down to somebody it'll be like 90 milliseconds for that it's like not a huge you know it's nothing that's deal breaking the deal breaker will be all twitch chat latency which will be like on the order of 500 milliseconds have you talked to Twitch is there anything you can do to like improve that latency I I could make them so they could play via um just the website but I don't want to yeah it's more fun to make them go on Twitch and all vote with W's and as's and S's and D's to say exactly what they want so it's a consist is like like most people said a here so we're going to move to the left basically like yeah I'll be taking like every 100 milliseconds every you know 75 milliseconds that consensus will then play that key for the next 75 milliseconds or whatever it is except if it's a fire it just plays it once you know and so it's just like you kind of have to make it play these different things and can you do like WF so that it both moves forward and Fires at the same time so I got to figure out like some of those things yeah uh so uh I guess this is an interesting kind of metac cognition thing but there there are going to be a certain number of people in your audience who are going to be wanting to step toward the imp's fireball as opposed to away from it and what if the number of trolls or Griefers like outnumbers the people who just want to play an honest game of Doom then we lose like that's that's the end you know the thing is is most generally speaking most people want to win so that's the nice part uh so that's why the second game I want to develop is going to be a tower defense where it's chat versus me and you can troll just the thing is you got to pay Bits And if you troll you hurt yourself you let me win so then there's like this whole fundamental thing so you the troll toll is only to hurt yourself and so the whole idea is that you get to if you're going to troll you make your own team lose and which makes me win and you the viewer there's a fundamental like you don't want the streamer to win yeah like there's there's definitely that just exists they want to see you not be successful so it like puts them in this really painful position where they have to try to make the right decision and you benefit monetarily from the bits I guess they make the worst decision if they troll to then you know yeah it's going to cost them five bucks so you have been successful on two mediums so this is like not like their influencers can never break off of Tik Tok right and like never really have success out of their their first platform but you have managed to kind of like transplant yourself over onto YouTube through like these vods video on demand and and other things like that you you seem to have like a really good editor uh who identifies like interesting clips and like chops them out and puts them up as Standalone videos like so you're kind of at the Forefront of the difference in culture between twitch which is primarily gamer driven and like YouTube which I mean is like everybody is the biggest website on the internet basically yeah um and like like so you're almost kind of like in a position where you could be like a cultural anthropologist uh between those two worlds like what are some of the things you've observed that are different on Twitch and the nature of that Medium versus YouTube which is you know like like real time with with chat versus YouTube with its extremely sluggish comment system not sluggish but like yeah you know people watch the video then they it's not it's not for communication yeah it's not for synchronous communication um it's for you know I always feel bad using the term async ever since Annie made a big deal about async and now I'm just like oh man it's so true async means to you know asynchronous communication is to take two Communications and synchronize them so we've been using the word all wrong but uh uh twitch is you go to Twitch for connection so that means that you're going there because you want to see someone you have something in mind typically is what twitch is about and YouTube you typically go to YouTube to watch something you want to watch and so there're just vastly different crowds people that you know really like YouTube they they they they'll just pretty much largely stay on YouTube people that really like twitch will largely just stay on Twitch okay so you've cultivated two like very different audiences um generally yeah have you noticed so like a lot of people probably have a parasocial relationship with you where like you don't necessarily know a whole lot about them but they know quite a bit about you especially if they spent a substantial amount of time watching your videos it could be said that before this call I had a parasocial relationship with you and you Pro you may not have had any sort of relationship with me I don't know if you ever listened to the free cocan podcast before so no I just knew your picture that's it ah well um what uh like how do you interact with people on Twitch and do you even go over to YouTube and like interacting the comment section on YouTube generally I stay away from the comment section uh just because there's a lot of really nice comments but then there's also a lot of like not so nice comments and so you know that's just a you know that's just a reality to all of it and so I'm I'm I'm okay with that and so I just I I don't like to I just don't it's just not there so I I like all the live stuff and so it's fun like talking to them because you can have like a more real conversation whereas if you you know if you're trying to respond to Twitch comments or a a YouTube comment section it's just like you say something they may say say something back but you'll probably never get the notification you have absolutely no idea what happened so it's like there's no real back and forth or real communication with it all and so it's it's just different yeah it's kind of like if I go on if I go on YouTube I have something like it's like 20,000 notifications yeah that's a lot those are those are mostly like people commenting on things that unfortunately comments that you probably won't have the time to read and like thoughtfully respond to yeah how do you do it on Twitch moving back to Twitch because I did live stream coding on Twitch for like maybe like six or eight months or something like that and I was right about like where you were talking like I might have 30 people tuning in like oh let's watch Quincy you know build the early versions of free C camper implement this feature or whatever how many years ago was that nine years ago okay so uh and there wasn't like a live coding section I don't even know if there is a live coding section on Twitch like people have been asking for like live coding like sections on Twitch for a long time is there one now yeah software and game development okay great I'm glad they added that cuz that was like really frustrating that like there was like no discovery on Twitch um yeah discover you never go to Twitch for Discovery that's generally A good rule thumb yeah and you know I it felt weird for me to be using like Twitter and like these other places that worked really hard to like try to steer attention to Twitch was a platform that like at the time N9 years ago not very many people got it I still don't really get it frankly like I don't use twitch uh just because like I podcast at Double speed while I'm like you know walking my kids and stuff like that like everything I don't know maybe that sounds like to toxic productivity type stuff but but like the idea of me sitting there and just watching somebody at real in real time do stuff on Twitch uh so so like I just want to be forthcoming I don't get twitch but but you seem you may missed doing it a little bit like if you were programming a whole bunch and you're just hanging out a lot of times people just use it as coworking space okay I'm over here building something you're over there building something you're remote working you don't have any people that you work with every now and then you start chatting and you know maybe I chat back with you and it's just like oh that's kind of like a fun experience is that how you started with it uh I mean I think that's just generally how people view it is this is just like something that they they're a part of it I think it's more of that kind of like so it's just more of a social interaction type thing yeah well are there any any big like changes or any big things that you're really excited about on either the twitch or the YouTube front like I know that you've got now your third Channel and I guess one question I have is like why all the channels like one's like news and reaction like article reaction Tech have four I technically have four channels um but yeah yeah I have my edited thought through video channel which I I'm we're editing a video right now H then I I did a keyboard review on the glove 80 um then I have like kind of like my article read hot t Channel and then I have uh me just long form programming Channel and then I have just like clips and shorts and just just things that I said and did on stream channel okay yeah reason being is it it should be pretty it should be pretty obvious uh but maybe maybe it isn't most people that watch you don't subscribe the people that do subscribe uh they come and they go and so if you don't have a voice on your channel you will attract many different groups and then as your videos go out you'll have these many different groups see your channel and they'll go oh I don't watch that you know and so you just have these like hard Nos and so Google doesn't really know how to promote that and so they just kind of shut it down and so it's just like okay here's my here's my people that want to watch curated engineering videos here is a curated engineering video oh people that just want to hear me riff off of an article or or something like that or a TW a tweet or something like that here's this group that just is like engineering ajacent they just want to hear about programming in Broad terms uh here's the hardcore coding one because if I just took an hour coding video and threw it on any of the other channels it just would it would just do horrible because that's just not the expectation people have yeah and so that's the that's the idea is that you just you create your own verticals and it just makes more sense because people just they don't want to see all the same content you have a pretty big audience of people that uh take your opinion seriously and it it carries a lot of weight especially as far as like you know programming practices or uh things that you think are you know more effective than other things you know just just basically like tradeoffs where people's opinion can fall on one side or the other but you have a strong opinion in a lot of these cases but you've said I'm just a man giving my opinion on the internet like how do you reconcile like just being a man giving your opinion with the responsibility of like essentially training a lot of the maybe mid career devs that tune in to your uh to your Twitch stream and and watch your YouTube videos like like how do you carry that responsibility uh as far as carry the responsibility I just don't think about it but I mean gen I know that sounds kind of weird but I mean generally speaking is that I really am I just I am just some guy on the internet and I just give my opinion and that's it I don't I don't try to be more than that I don't try to be less than that um I think that I think people often just take everything so dang seriously so I just I just I just do the opposite I think that's I think that's why I've been been so successful is that if you look at the older kind of the longer stayed Twitter Tech celebrities they're all so serious and and you know and as in the last like two years I feel like I singlehandedly have destroyed a lot of the online tech Twitter like what it was uh I feel very proud of that but it's just it's just it was so serious all the time it's just like so highbrow and the thing is is that most people just aren't highbrow most people are just normal people that don't care and they just would rather laugh a little and you know if there's a little something to discuss about Tech then we'll talk about tech and then we'll make some stupid tweet you know like I just like today just all I did was make a tweet where it's just if you know new promise instead of reject or resolve reject it was respect disrespect you know it's just like there's nothing to that and someone said it the best part someone even said it in the chat and so I was just like MIT grabbed it and tweeted it or turned it into like a code picture and then tweeted it and it's like that just does fantastic because it doesn't mean anything it's just a dumb observation that we're all familiar with and that's it and like that's that's just fun and so I just I feel like the the the general discourse is still struggling between these two halves but it's definitely like just caving to one side which is just you know it's not like like maybe maybe it doesn't have to be that important on at all times maybe not everything has to be the most academic maybe it can just be dumb for the sake of being dumb and we can just have fun about it and that's okay it's only male modeling it's it's just models all the way down and so it's funny I don't know I just I I've enjoyed it I've really enjoyed it yeah so another thing that I think is really interesting about uh you is like you jump from one project to another but you do actually finish the products usually um and you say uh you've said that you love the process of creation for creation's sake but as creation turns into maintenance it starts to feel like work since most projects eventually become more about maintenance than creation if you're working like with like a large Legacy codebase or something like that you're probably spending I don't know maybe maybe you could argue on this point but you're probably spending about as much time just maintaining that and making sure that that continues to work as you are actually building out new functionality and stuff would is that a fair statement yeah yeah Harpoon is like my big Thorn to my side it's my most popular plugin I absolutely love it it works for me but people keep using it in Stupid Ways and they want me to fix it and so I'm just like I don't know quit doing it that way you know but I also realize that there's some bugs and some things that people want fixed or some extensions and so it's like I need to do some stuff I I really do need to spend another two weeks or probably I I honestly probably need to spend just 10 more hours kind of just wrapping up stuff with Harpoon and then I can release version two on 69 yeah so how do you know when it's time to like just let a project rot or like completely deprecate it and and move on with your life it's just when when I don't care anymore that's it you know I I build things for the sake of building them and if if there's something that I really like I build it to the point where I like it and use it all the time what makes you care about it is it like knowing a whole lot of people are depending on it because there's a lot of Open Source projects that like you know everybody's depending on like you know I think like Heartbleed and the one guy in his you know server closet like trying to keep basically the internet afloat uh and uh you know pretty thankless job but like that has to be maintained right that's Mission critical infrastructure is there anything You' built that you feel is like even though you don't like working on it you feel compelled to work on it just because so many people are depending on it oh yeah Harpoon would be the only one and so that's the one that I I will try to make something better with it but I I I like it the way it is and I don't want to add new features and so it's like me just saying no is the predominant way I maintain it but every now and then I begrudgingly add something yeah yeah and you said that programming is such a key part of your life and that it's always been such a part of your life that you really can't even imagine doing anything other than programming let's say hypothetically that you're like a Kevin mitnik type character rip and the FBI has literally forbade you forbade forbidded you from using computers for like 10 years or something like you cannot get within 10t of a computer or you're going directly to jail like if you were in a situation like that where you literally could not program what would you do like where would you Channel your time property property what do you mean by property real estate Adventures let's talk about that for a second uh because you used to live in San Francisco Bay area where I used to live before I moved back to Texas um and you moved back to back to uh South South Dakota South Dakota yeah and and like obviously there's like a you can buy a lot more in South Dakota and you can buy a lot more in Texas than you can in San Francisco uh have you ever thought about taking like your ridiculously high Netflix you know like I don't know if Netflix like adjusts your income at all if you like work remotely or if you move to a different place yeah they they adjusted my income for sure okay I don't work there anymore I I worked there for 10 and a half years and recently quit about a month and a half ago yeah so but but up until that point like what were you thinking about doing with those fund like where does the extra money go is it just going towards supporting a family of six uh we did a very big investment into the land that we bought we bought a strategic place as opposed to a place to live um just because we knew that a lot of building was going this direction the school was bidding on land near us all that kind of stuff and so we bought a plot of land as as an investment you know to try to hold for five years and it's it's fairly expensive so that's where most of our funds honestly go um so that's that's one thing uh the next thing is that after that we just kind of put a lot of we've just focused on my wife really likes running airbnbs and so we got a couple airbnbs and she just loves doing that and she likes Remodeling and all that and so or she does I let me rephrase that she hates remodeling but she knows she needs to do it to make the place look really nice and be the way she wants it to be and so that's where like a lot of her effort and time gets spent and so I know if I couldn't do this I would just pivot into that you know I just learn all the things you need to learn to be really great at that because it's it's like all all these activities aren't hard they're again it's just time right like just like programming programming I mean programming is objectively hard but it's also just a time orienting and so if I were to do some of these things like I I would never be a great woodworker I probably am starting way too l uh late in my life but could I hang sheetrock yeah I could hang sheetrock and you know learn to paint learn to refinish floors do everything and just get really good at that and just put my time completely into that yeah it's funny you mentioned woodworking because there's like this meme or something that like programmers like all the programmers today are the people that would be Woodworkers like 100 years ago 200 years ago and that like do you see parallels between doing things with your hands like in in a like a wood shop or or even metal shop like and you know building software yeah I mean you could also probably swap us out with like potentially painters and all that but I mean obviously back then things were so much different and so like here's a good example that did you know that college uh the original idea of a Bachelor of Arts was to prepare someone's life for leisure so it was the it was the act of um of endowing someone who's already rich with the ability to know how to read and follow out the poets and all that so I would definitely probably not be in that c category just if my life were simar I would probably not be on that side and so when people are doing these you know I probably wouldn't be on the art side would be would be a fair take I wouldn't be writing poetry SL doing art but you know I think that it's just the creation part it's just that you want to be able to build things and most of the things you build are probably just very practical for your life in the moment just you know so I'd probably fall on that side maybe I'd hope yeah you know the reality is probably if I lived 200 years ago I'd probably be on a farm or die in it would have probably been pretty horrible but you know like luckily I don't have to you know be in that time yeah unfortunately most people probably would have died like long before their time before they could realize their creative Pursuits just because it's the way things were was and people forget that yeah and people also yeah forget that fact about higher education that it wasn't designed to train you know soldiers returning from World War II to be able to enter industry and it was designed to help rich kids be able to have peacock brains and show off to mates and stuff like that basically and and to be able to fit in at dinner parties and oh look at Junior he's so audite you know stuff like that and yeah it was literally 1% like in the most educated place in the world London the 1900s right like like college really did not pick up steam as something that people did until post World War II era um when the government started funding uh through the GI Bill and stuff like that but anyway I digress but it is really interesting uh that like you know like you could actually kind of consider programming more of a craftsmanship than you could consider it like a high art or whatever right I I don't know where do you fall in that Spectrum like like CRA or an artisan probably depends on the area right uh you know like if you're doing like the really high academic thought things machine learning I think once you get into like I don't know if you've ever handrolled your own MLP or RBF or any of those things uh it's it's it's it's a lot of effort and now you you know once you start getting into the research area then I think you fall into this really intense like it's much more of an artisan become a master at math and then apply the math to these specific categories and all that kind of stuff that's you know that's a different vibe than uh being able to build stuff yeah you know being able to build stuff quick like I can build most things and most things that I build you know like I've been building this project now for you know about a month and a half and I've probably put a good 100 plus hours 200 hours into it and I've just been building only the coing side of things how to make a bunch of bites and make them smaller and I've built almost everything out and now I'm going to combine them all like right now and you know the interfaces largely just all fell together almost just perfectly despite making many mid mid programming shifts it's just because I've just done it for so long that I have a bunch of just like General ideas of how to program for the long term and this is kind of where that craftsmanship comes in where I can just kind of I I will fall within the 80 to 90% now it won't be you know won't hit a 100 but most of the time but I I'll I'll hit a good 80 90% pretty regularly and so that's like it's fun you know it's that it's that craftsmanship that's building quality stuff yeah I mean how much do you feel like you're just like falling back on your instincts that are honed over the years at the keyboard uh when you're when you're doing like a lot of like does stuff disappear and you're just like doing it or are you frequently pulling back to really think are you going to like the Whiteboard and I rarely rarely really think I rarely I it's just like I just know what I want and I feel like I can see the path and I don't really think about the path it's kind of like walk you know it's like when you go hiking you don't think about every last turn you kind of think like I want to get up to this point and I know there's that one part with the field with the flowers there's this other part with the Rocks you know oh then there's that one part with just a bunch of really tall pine trees right like you just have like these places in your head that you know you're going to go through and then the rest is just kind of you know just details a so it feels like walking and and by the way that walk I just described was uh the easy way on the m in Boseman Montana so if you ever done the hike in bosan Montana to the m it starts off with like a bunch of rocks kind of deeper bush area and then you go out into the field of flowers and then you turn into these really tall pine trees and so it's like know each spot's a little different I don't know how many turns or twists there are in between each but that's generally what happens yeah but you just kind of manually or like instinctively navigate things and it just it just happens right before you know it you're toward the end of the trail um okay so so likening building software and like integrating all these bits of software that you've written almost to just walking a trail because you've been you've done that so many times you kind of just instinctively know how to put one foot in front of the other yeah yeah like I I know what I want so if you watch one of my streams like today programmed I've never ever once in my life done Huffman and coding uh uh ever I've just never built a Huffman and code anything and so last week I watched a five minute YouTube video on it and it's like okay this is how you write a Huffman tree I was like ah okay I I see how that works and so from there I wrote the Huffman tree generator I wrote the in I wrote how how I'm going to Binary serialize that into a protocol so I could have it on the other side how to take that protocol and efficiently walk it and then also how to like how do you encode and decode encoding and decoding is really difficult because you got to walk from the most significant bit to the least significant bit and putting in these bits one at a time and all that and so there's like a lot to it that just wasn't a part of the video I just knew that I would do that like that's it it's just because I've seen it so many times that I've never done something before and I can and I even first tried one of it like genuinely first try just programmed for 45 minutes straight hundreds of lines put it in pressed play and it just worked all the way through unit test pass and everything wow so you like it was like movie coding yeah movie coding yeah yeah yeah it just it's still not movie coding in the sense that the next one I then took me four it took me four runs we do this thing where I get three runs and if I cannot make it pass on the third run then I lose or I win so we have bets and people place Channel points on whether I'm going to win or lose on these things and so today on the encoding side it took me just one try so one out of three to just get it done on the decoding side it took four out of three so I had to go into a second round best out of three to get it so I first tried the second try let's because I bit shifted the wrong direction like that's it I bit shifted I bit shifted the thing over as opposed to bringing it back down so like a very common error the programmers probably just stupid yeah yeah and it sounds like because you've put in the Reps at the keyboard and because you have this massive kind of Corpus of knowledge and learned experience from spending so much time coding that you have this kind of frame this scaffolding that you just kind of throw new ideas on right like you watch this five minute YouTube video and you kind of like maybe almost subconsciously saw the patterns and made these associations and you just internalized it yeah pretty much yeah that's something an experienced programmer can do and that uh maybe that's why like sometimes it's seems like if you're a new developer and you're trying to like solve like a project Oiler problem or something like that and you're just oh my goodness you spend like six hours doing it uh and then you could just like somebody like you could probably sit down and do that in like two or three minutes you know maybe maybe thing with it right yeah yeah and and that's why you know experienced developers are so in demand and we could we could kind of maybe talk about the job market because I do want to talk about AI um yeah we're coming up on two hours so we may want to uh figure out which one because I might get longwinded and talk about 40 minutes on one and then we're just like so far over time that your kids are going be like you're I'm taking my kids to cce's Pizza yeah yeah they they love that means you gota at some point you got to feed them so let's let's pick one you can you can choose okay so let's talk about Ai and let's go that's the one I wanted I mean yeah yeah I I mean I do kind of want to talk about like some of the misconceptions about how it's going to impact the labor market let's just start with with AI though okay okay so you published a video like maybe six or eight months ago a year ago like where you're like I tried uh I tried a copilot for like six months and then I just ripped it out and I I didn't want to use it anymore do you remember that video that was about a month and a half ago that I talked about that yeah it was just it was just recently I'm only about a month and a half into not using copilot okay but I could have sworn I saw a video like a long time ago where you talked I've started using copilot uh I started using it in the beta phase like way before everybody a net Freedman the CEO of GitHub at that point sent me how to use it and gave me the credentials and access to a private GitHub library to be able to use it in Vim okay so you use it like like I just like I'm going to step back I just want to hear your thoughts on copilot having been like one of the early beta users having used it a lot having stepped back from it like you know everything that's transpired since this tool kind of fell into your lap MH um so here's my my my general take on cop I think copilot is great I think that it's a very fancy autocomplete uh but that's all it is if you don't like I I was starting to get my masters in AI so I have a general idea of how MLPs what what their like purpose is and I have some understanding there's no reasoning that goes on and I know everyone will say you know this or that and oh it's it's AGI and all these kind of things now it's just it's really good at predicting the next set of tokens that should come out you give it some input it gives it it gives you some output it's really great at predictive stuff it's really great at extrapolating and it can just do some things that are just so amazing right you give it a p picture of a pop can it's like pop can right it just knows it doesn't you know like you you look at this and you see green you see green all the way through but a computer like right here that's like white like if you were to look at a picture of this it would dramatically change color because it it's actually it's not it's not green at that point and so but our brain just maps all these things on and makes it so easy and we just don't realize how you know complex these actions actually and so it's you know when I start when I stopped using copilot what I realized is that it was just during the time right after I've been learning go for the first time like in a in a serious sense uh I was learning go for about two months and when I turned off copilot I realized I didn't know go I didn't I I Bamboozled myself into thinking I knew go I didn't know go and what I knew is how to use copilot to write go and I realized like man I'm like I'm not good at this like I thought I was a lot better but I'm really not that good and so I quit using it and I realized all these weird habits I would just like stop typing and you know like one of the videos I watched at not too long ago talked about like the copilot pause yeah it's real I would just pause I would just stop for whatever reason that's that waiting for copilot to tell me what to do and it's just like I realized I was just like largely inhibiting myself and I did not like that one bit I did not like the fact that I was kind of um it's not that I thought I was going to become redundant or thinking the robots are going to take over I was just simply not I I effectively it's almost like I just filled my coating abilities with water and turned the temperature way down I just froze them in time and so it's just like from when I picked up go for the first time which generally you're like okay at go you can just you can just go if you have any programming experience you just you just know it by nature and so it's like I just froze it and I just kept knowing that same amount of go despite getting faster I was just getting FAS with AI and so once that turned off it was just like I had a I had a reality call and I was like wow okay so I see what it actually does and I don't like that I want to change this I want to be you know I want to be better at it so I turned it off and for the last month I've turned it off and I feel like despite having to type more and I do miss some of the auto completes quite a bit I am happy I still have it off even though I would definitely say I have to type more for sure and there's times where I'm like oh gosh this would be such a good copilot Moment Like right here copilot would just know exactly what I want you know it's just like it's so obvious what I want and so it's just like that part's painful but the rest is just like so like the tradeoff is just I'm not willing to go back right now so like that's what it is for you like all the hype and everything and it's really just something that saves you a few keystrokes you already know what you wanted to type it's just like okay did it autocomplete it correctly so I don't have to type an extra 60 characters here effectively yeah like you can see it too if you start using copilot like write something that will read one bite out of a buffer and then name the next me method 16bit reader and then watch it go like that's all it's doing is it's just trying to extrapolate what you're already doing into the next thing and it's just like ah we just got done building this thing that looked like this shape here's the next thing that's probably the shape you're looking for and bada bing bada boom it's just going to work you're going to be like wow that was pretty convenient I like that a whole bunch and it's just like I found like I'm not going to say I was addicted to it but I was most certainly like I was dependent there was a dependency for sure on it and it just I was just so dang Blown Away by how much that thing kind of made my learning process atrophy like I couldn't write a for Loop in in like in Lua so I was doing a lot of Lua as well I could not write a for Loop during that time I realized I did not know the syntax yeah because it always autocom completed it for me it's like do you need to know the syntax I mean toine the word need that's the problem and so it's like that for me it's just like that's that's my big takeaway with copilot is that I I believe it's a fan bargain as of right now for those that don't know Dr fa you get what you want in the moment and ultimately it's the devil that takes everything away in the end right you trade something good for ultimately something evil that's my person I know I know some people they strongly disagree with this and they talk about oh man it's it's it's making it so that more it's it's making programming more approachable more people can start programming it is better in general for everybody I hear all those arguments I'm not even arguing against those arguments what I'm saying is that the people that are feeling more productive they're not actually being more productive they're not actually learning anything and there's something pretty serious about that long term there's something very serious about you not actually learning some pretty important skills CU I don't know what the consequence is I could just see in myself the atrophy that happened or the inability like I I saw in myself atrophy is probably not the right term I saw in myself the inability to become good at something that I was doing fulltime and so know it at like a more personal level so I was like holy cow that's that's a red flag for me I don't know what the consequences are but that's a red flag yeah and for you like it seems like being good at something is like the whole name of the game like the whole reason you're playing is to get better um so so that like it seems like an incredibly counterproductive thing to basically give yourself a tool that'll help you get your work done faster but your work is always going to you're like plateauing yourself essentially yeah and that I mean that's the big worry is like is is it good for anybody like yeah maybe I like the craft you don't like the craft but then my argument next thing is will you actually will this help you ship faster in six months 12 months or are you actually like is there some line that exists where you actually Plateau faster even though the other person maybe took a little bit longer but they grow even faster and you can say oh well it helps me learn the canonical way of doing things all this kind of stuff and my counterargument is that it's really hard to know if the canonical way or what you perceive as the canonical way is actually the good way to write code you don't know like that's it that's the answer again it's not about working hard or smart you just don't know so you have to Simply fail and learn why certain things don't like lend themselves well so if you never have to switch environments switch languages switch you know various things you're not going to like get bamboozled into bad traps you're not going to try to apply a certain of thinking to a problem that's like drastically terrible for it it's CU you just don't have that that experience you you've you've traded it off for Speed yeah do you think that uh people are just kind of like I mean Guitar Hero kind of like got people like at least making the motions of playing guitar even though they weren't really playing guitar but they could feel like they were playing guitar and maybe they were actually developing like some Rhythm and some of the manual dexterity and stuff to play guitar but it's just like this kind of like uh you know Similac of act it's like almost a parody of actual coding if you're just hitting Tab and like tapping a few things and hitting Tab and you're just tabing through the different results and like it it I can definitely see how this is bad for new programmers and potentially bad for like more experienced programs because you're pretty experienced and you're you're thinking it's bad for you at what point do you think that people should introduce this into their workflow let's say they're new to software development completely like they've been coding for like six months they they've solved a bunch of project Oiler problems or they've gone through like a certification on freeo Camp or something like that and they're really still just getting their their wings as developers there's got to be a temptation to use this tool that helps you get things done and and can it feel like training wheels do do you have kids who learned how to ride bikes I guess would be a question yeah yeah yeah I do you know the funny part is that you know the best way to ride to learn how to ride bikes which has been a large big change since we were kids assuming you're approximately the same ages age near me me being 37 okay go you definitely have the same experience then training wheels you don't do training wheels anymore training wheels are objectively bad they're not just kind of bad they're objectively bad you don't do training wheels anymore Striders you get kids bikes with no pedals and they learn to push and ride and glide on them and what it does is it it teaches them the more Superior skill to learning how to bike which is balance pedaling is not hard pedaling is something you learn in a moment but balance is that thing you have to go do like 50 times 100 times thousand times until you're like really comfortable making turns and all that you start hitting Hills on those little Striders and kids start going back and forth like they get good at the act of biking just missing the pedaling part and so it's like that has been a huge just a huge game Cher for kids learning how to bike and so I that's that's I look at copilot more like training wheel so like should you learn how to uh or should you when should you use copilot here's my general rule of thumb is when you should uh use copilot if copilots produce code that surprises you or if you use copilot to solve a problem because you don't know how you probably shouldn't use it it's not an autocomplete it's not a copilot it is a pilot you know you're on autopilot change things up learn how to do those things you're the one who autopilot yeah it's doing the actual heavy lifting you're basically just kind of like teeing it up and like letting yeah so are you you should be like it should be you know that like I'm not a sports ball guy but in in in football someone snaps someone catches and lines the ball up and someone kicks are you the kicker or are you the person that sets up the ball you want to be the kicker you're the person doing the thing you want someone that's just like taking out the boiler plate of getting ready to kick for you yeah that's a good analogy so a lot of people are like really freaked out about Ai and like Devon Ai and like you know the the AI hype cycle like has has reached yet another Crescendo in its many years of AI Winters and AI Summers not that it's not bringing a lot of fruit like I use AI all the time and I imagine you do too for good things not just for things that I'm too lazy to do properly right um there are novel things you can do with AI with using like gp4 which I use a lot structured questions that you would never be able to get like a good Google result for but you can potentially have like a a rich conversation with it and like learn stuff and yet a lot of people are really freaking out because they greatly overestimate this token predictor and what it can do and you know yeah like like what would be your advice to somebody who's getting into and you probably get this question all the time I get it like several times a day I'm not exaggerating like people email me all the time uh yeah what at least once or twice a stream someone asked this exact question about is the AI going to take our jobs what's going to happen am I just learning a useless skill like there's like a thousand of this that direction of questions that are all kind of wrapped up into the answer that I'm I'm going to attempt to give okay great uh so let's first start with momentum uh the internet we can all argue is a phenomenal uh thing for business right businesses have been able to do a vast amount more with less resources due to the internet existing the internet started coming around with what arpanet in the 60s it really started to hit its stride in the 90s when you started getting uh 144k and 56k modems like how long until you really started to see the internet well the first.com bust was really to just a bust because we didn't have the pipeline we didn't have the infrastructure to really handle it and so didn't it it like the internet was around for so long but for businesses to really adapt and start using it which today you still have most businesses like most businesses don't even really have a personal website if anything you know they may have just something really really small and that's it uh and so that took like 25 years to really get integrated into society and so just apply that to AI let's just say the AI is incredible it's not it's like society's not changing tomorrow it's going to take a long time these big businesses these big corporations right now we're in the exploratory phase which is here's this thing that is just really you know like the culmination of the last uh 80 years of research into into AI in this one particular branch of uh multilayer perceptrons or whatever you know whatever the llm underlying Tech is and here it is we have a business what happens if you start letting things be steered by this what are the consequences what kind of guidelines do you have to have what kind of this that you like think about the 9,000 questions that have to be set up for this to even become a business viable solution some people rushed in used it and then backed away you I mean how many stories have you read about like people going oh crap we overdid this one not a good plan and so they're all pulling things away and so that like that's just like the business learning phase and that's like a 10year phase and then at some point it's going to be good enough to be integrated and we're going to start seeing it as a real part of our life so my guess is we still got like at least 10 years where things are going to be fairly the way they are today it'll just like slowly be going and then that's something point it's going to go from slow to fast and now it's everywhere uh so the next question is is what is it going to affect in my opinion and I don't think this is I don't think this is an opinion I think this is just a matter of fact if you ask the AI to do something it will do that something hey paint me a picture of a crab it produces you crab my counter question to you is why was that the right crab and you'll realize there's no reason why I couldn't have been one of 10 million other variations of the same crab it they crab is an archetype it can be visualized in a bajillion different ways but do the same thing with the AI and ask it hey give me a perfectly white canvas it's like just not going to do it you saw in the new uh jiid 4 Omni video uh the guy was just like hey girl and guy I want you to sing trading Lines by and they just didn't do it he's like no no no I want you to you sing one line and then he sings one line and then it didn't did it it's like no you got to stop at one line and you need to like the problem is again is that you went from an answer can be the answer to a specific answer is the answer and once you go from that that translation layer all of the sudden that's where the like AI completely fall off a perfectly white canvas is virtually impossible just like it is asking like there's that Meme that's going on the internet right now ask the AI ask chat chippity 4 40 the newest greatest most fantastic piece of technology ever how many ARS are in strawberry and what positions and it was coming up with the craziest answers even though it's like perfectly obvious to us because again you've gone from uh like a conceptual question like what could be the next thing that comes out to I want this precise thing and this is why we don't this is why you don't program in English you don't program in English because English is highly uh uh tolerant to like heirs I can like how I'm even describing this there's a thousand different ways I could have just said what I got done saying and all of those would have been acceptable English is just not a precise form of communic ation it's meant to go from thought to thought and the path we take is going to be some sort of you know version of our upbringing our culture all that kind of stuff and so now you're on to this idea of going from that language which is just terrible for specific uh or for specifications I.E read any legal document two like uh like this is a legal specification for what the AI needs to do and it just it utterly fails because it's not the right like that's not going to be it and so I'm not worried about this version of AI could there exist a future version in which can do all these things sure why not um but let me hit you with like a different idea yeah in the in the 2005 2003 to 2005 era you were going from a 1.3 MHz computer to like a 2 mahz computer the rate of change was incredible if you would have been living down that in that era which I was I thought man in 10 years I'm going to be using 10 10 GHz computers it's going to be crazy all these kind of things and guess what happened yeah it didn't yeah it didn't happen it did not happen because there is a fundamental diminishing return that exists out there and so like is this AI the worst version of AI we'll ever experience or is this AI actually in that Golden Era of growth where we're about to come up to a hard wall we actually don't know the answer to that and so if anyone tells you there's some future AI that's going to be magical and all powerful maybe we don't have any evidence of that ever being true in any other form of of creation right now like everything scales hor like the the economy of scale is never it just never goes that direction I would love it to be real but I don't see any evidence for it and so long story short should you be worried about the AI taking your job if you are a customer service representative in which your job is to take in a fundamentally flawed input match it against some sort of business requirements and then spit out another fundamentally flawed response to a person like yeah that's a very dangerous place to be if your job is to look at images like TSA looking at what could be dangerous and not dangerous in a backpack there very well could be a place where that starts to become a diminished return on that like there's these activities that you're just kind of like guessing and oh we need to check this backpack to see if it actually is bad or good like maybe that is maybe those type of positions will go away because you're just kind of it's kind of a guessing thing but at the end of the day anything that's like really concrete like I need to check the backpack now or hey I'm the doctor I'm going to review the MRI like those still have people behind them and programming is the like the Pinnacle of the world's most specific thing ever every single keyword every single symbol every single identifier has its exact position and its meaning and one has a consequence into the next one that's why it's just like such a disaster as these llms get longer and longer into stuff cuz the consequence of being mostly right compiles just horribly so even if they take that mostly right and you know are able to move it down to a thousandth of what it is today that's still completely wrong right there is no completely there's no mostly right in programming this is not horseshoes this is not hand grenades this is a precise mathematical expression of what your intent is so there you go so I think there's just no danger in this current world for or AI is taking your job if anything it's going to be the greatest uh I think the greatest amount of jobs will be created in the next 10 years in uh in general programming because of the amount of pure nonsense that is created I don't know if you saw the study I know I'm still going sorry I just have so much to say about this this is great but there's this study that rated or that that tracked the amount of lines changed in public op like open source repos in the last four years on GitHub and since the Advent of AI and its usage the amount of uh line changes not line additions not line deletions but lines in which were reworked has gone up from once every 6 months on average to once every two weeks like the rate of change is just blowing out of the water things are just being changed so much faster now they can just be wildly changed now you could argue many reasons for that maybe in the next in the last couple years so many new people have gone in so they've kind of poisoned the well for like just constantly changing code and blah blah blah you could come up with a bunch of different potential answers but the rate of change either way is going a lot like how many times do you commit code and then have to rework code especially if it's I've been bit by chat chippity copilot so many times on generating code that I thought was correct because I didn't take the strong care to create it myself but instead just went that looks correct and then just got you know I lgmt that one or whatever it is looks good to me and just slapped that seal on these codes over and over again and Bam I've been hit with so many bugs because of that yeah all right I got a last question for you first of all I just want to say that like uh that is pretty much how I've been responding uh to people is just that like you're greatly overestimating what might come to pass and you're also overestimating how good these tools are today because they're not that great yeah right um precis they're great novelty like the fact that I predicted you had a tie game after you said Win Lose else and it's like tie you're like oh my goodness this thing's magical that's because no no autocompletes ever done that it was magical yeah it doesn't mean it's like it's actually good it's just magic it just feels magical Ian people were impressed with the lives of when it came out because it could keep a conversation going wow this great but but once you understand the trick and once you understand the trick about how these llms work it does kind of like you're like okay it's doing good but like this is nowhere near ready for prime time no pun intended there all right so last question so if people shouldn't be you know getting uh copilot integrated into their workflow if they shouldn't be like just you know relying on these tools and assuming that these tools are going to be able to deliver them uh from you know the drudgery of having to like manually code things themselves what are the fundamentals that you think people should prioritize let's say like people who are you know undergraduate studying computer science or people that are transitioning into Tech from other careers like accounting or truck driving or something like that like what are the skills that you would encourage people to prioritize investing their time into right now well so there's kind of a couple things there one what should you learn is a is a hard question and that really depends on you what you're interested in uh for me the biggest thing that I say is the same thing I say about working out what's the workout that's going to make you do that workout that tomorrow you're going to do another workout that's much better than the world's most perfect wellth thought through workout because if the the world's most perfect wellth thought through workout isn't the workout that's going to make you come back then don't do that one what's the one that's going to make you come back because your biggest like the biggest Ally to you today will be just time in the saddle time in the saddle is your like greatest indicator for you becoming successful at something just do it right now right you don't you don't know what you like you don't know what you don't like so build stuff read stuff read you know like there's algorithms courses I'm sure free code Camp has some algorithms courses learn a little bit of data structures learn a little bit about networks go learn about HTP servers go learn about the front end go learn about the back end go learn about embedded why not right why don't you get thorsten Balls book uh what's it called uh in The Interpreter p.com go if you're interested in how interpreters work like how does JavaScript actually run that's a very easy book to get into like just like these kind of simple things that just simply open your eyes and you go through the process of building cuz that's like that's like your first few years right if you want to be useful at programming that should be your first 10 years right and I know that's that sounds horrible but like there is no six I don't believe there is a sixmonth path to becoming some sixfigure job like I know that may have existed at one point during Co but that's because I mean we went from you don't have to be on the internet to like oh my goodness for the next year you have to be on the internet like obviously that kind of changed the demand and need for people to build stuff and some budgets got really blown out to the point where you could have that happen so yeah there was a time period where that may have happened but that is not the normal that should never be your expectation it should be a marathon it should not be a Sprint amen well it's been an absolute pleasure having you on the free cam podcast Prime and uh yeah I'm going to include links to a lot of cool primagen stuff like your YouTube channels anything you think I should uh if there's like a particular video that you think be helpful for people I can link to it and I just want to thank you again for coming here everybody who uh listen this far into the conversation I hope you have a fantastic week until next week happy coding
