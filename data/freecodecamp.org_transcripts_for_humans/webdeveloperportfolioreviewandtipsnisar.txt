00:00 - hey guys benjamin's back here thanks for
00:02 - tuning in uh so i'm just doing a quick
00:05 - portfolio review for uh nasir i believe
00:08 - is how you pronounce it i'm gonna do
00:10 - just the desktop and the mobile version
00:12 - of it uh just give my first impressions
00:14 - on the overall responsiveness some of
00:17 - the animations the font the layout etc
00:20 - etc
00:21 - um
00:22 - i think i'm also going to go ahead and
00:24 - reviews his social media presence as
00:27 - well
00:28 - just as a little added bonus um you know
00:30 - hopefully he appreciates that
00:32 - uh but yeah he had reached out to me on
00:34 - twitter i introduced him to the
00:37 - uh codecareer.org discord community
00:40 - which you can just get to by going to
00:41 - codecareer.org discord and uh in there
00:45 - he got some decent feedback from one of
00:47 - our admins alex and he'll also be
00:50 - getting a little bit of feedback from me
00:51 - so anyway without further ado let's go
00:53 - to dive in
00:55 - so at first right off the bat he has a
00:58 - nice introduction says hi i'm the seer
01:00 - uh let's see
01:03 - okay dig that
01:05 - um
01:07 - i love performance as much as expert and
01:10 - i try to be my best to create ux rich
01:14 - performance websites and web apps
01:17 - okay um
01:22 - i suppose the only thing i see here is
01:25 - if um
01:27 - if you're gonna if nasir is going to do
01:30 - um you know capital case where like each
01:33 - letter
01:34 - um of each word is capitalized then i
01:37 - would ideally apply that rule to
01:40 - anything that's four letters or more
01:42 - so it would capitalize much and
01:45 - capitalize create
01:49 - personally though
01:50 - i think i would prefer
01:52 - in on my own website just to have
01:55 - everything
01:56 - uh you know a standard case so you just
01:58 - have like the eyes capitalized and then
02:00 - all of the other
02:02 - letters under here are lowercase
02:04 - i feel like that adds a better
02:07 - contrast between the header here and
02:09 - then the the subheader or description
02:13 - because this is quite a bit of text i
02:14 - would kind of regard it as a description
02:16 - um
02:17 - so i just kind of like to see that
02:19 - contrast personally
02:20 - but um overall good
02:23 - cool and it looks like you have a nice
02:24 - nifty animation here when you go ahead
02:26 - and hover over that dig that
02:28 - and it looks like it comes as a pop-up
02:31 - all right i like the pop-up the
02:34 - font is nice the overall layout here is
02:37 - great i like the separation of colors
02:40 - dig that animation that's good
02:42 - uh let's see grab my cv find out more
02:44 - about me
02:46 - all right just take a quick look at this
02:49 - okay cool
02:52 - uh okay going back
02:55 - um
02:57 - one thing i might
02:59 - recommend is
03:01 - keep
03:03 - well
03:06 - that's
03:07 - excuse me on second thought i do
03:08 - actually like the color difference of
03:10 - the footer here
03:11 - and the the button because it does cause
03:14 - the button to stay up or stand out i was
03:17 - initially going to recommend keeping
03:18 - these the same color but i like what you
03:20 - did there
03:22 - um i think the one thing
03:25 - i would recommend is maybe changing this
03:27 - font playing with it just a little bit
03:29 - maybe making it a little bit brighter
03:32 - you know a little bit more of like a
03:34 - whitish color
03:36 - just to make your key details stand out
03:39 - but at the same time i also understand
03:41 - that you want your core focus to be
03:44 - the user clicking on the download button
03:46 - so
03:48 - i don't know i think there's there's a
03:49 - balance there and you did strike the
03:51 - balance pretty well
03:52 - um
03:56 - yeah i suppose whichever way you're
03:58 - leaning like if you if you
04:00 - want to
04:01 - make that information more apparent then
04:03 - i would make it a brighter color if you
04:07 - want to make it a little bit less
04:08 - distracting and really focus in on the
04:10 - download button then it would make the
04:12 - font there uh down here a little bit
04:15 - smaller
04:17 - maybe keep it the same color you know
04:19 - just then that way it's not as
04:22 - predominant it's not pulling as much
04:24 - attention away from the download button
04:27 - excuse me if that's the key focus that
04:29 - you want to have
04:30 - but overall dig it alright so let's
04:33 - close that out
04:38 - now this is a nice large out excuse me a
04:42 - nice large chunk of text
04:45 - can't speak tonight um
04:47 - personally i kind of like to break
04:49 - things up a little bit so if you have
04:51 - like say three maybe four sentences
04:53 - um
04:54 - i would break that up into separate
04:56 - paragraphs or
04:57 - personally i'm a fan of one to two
04:59 - sentences per paragraph uh just because
05:02 - for readability people love to
05:05 - kind of skim things and it just it makes
05:07 - it easier on the eye uh you know there's
05:09 - much less reader fatigue but overall
05:11 - looks good
05:13 - um
05:15 - i think again on this it would follow
05:18 - the you know a very similar uh
05:20 - capitalized case as your
05:23 - description or subheader here
05:26 - you know try to keep
05:27 - this capital case so each letter of a
05:32 - larger
05:33 - word is capitalized and then keep this
05:35 - lowercase
05:36 - with the exception of the start of every
05:38 - sentence
05:39 - um
05:41 - yeah because it's just it looks really
05:43 - weird to the eye
05:44 - um to the eye to see
05:48 - uh you know like you looking web
05:50 - developer capitalized but then there's
05:53 - uh like this is lowercase
05:55 - that's lowercase that's lowercase
05:57 - um but then it comes back to these being
06:00 - uppercase
06:01 - um
06:02 - just looks a little strange at first
06:03 - glance so that's one thing i think i
06:05 - would address
06:06 - um again love the animation though let
06:08 - me go ahead and click that
06:10 - cool and that brings you right to
06:12 - twitter
06:18 - alright and your skill set
06:20 - again probably the same feedback in
06:22 - terms of
06:24 - uh you know breaking this out making it
06:26 - look a little bit more readable
06:28 - um
06:29 - one to two sentences per paragraph again
06:32 - same thing with the text um you know
06:35 - staying consistent with the the capital
06:37 - case
06:38 - uh setup that you have or lowercase
06:40 - setup
06:41 - um
06:44 - another thing you could do i do actually
06:46 - like
06:47 - the
06:48 - overall readability of this like just
06:50 - peppering in or or putting in your
06:54 - skill sets in in text i like that i like
06:57 - the
06:58 - the dotting that you use for the
06:59 - underlining
07:01 - maybe though i would
07:03 - write like a paragraph or so about your
07:05 - skills like right here
07:08 - and then kind of like list some of your
07:10 - skills so like one to you know like um
07:13 - under that so i have like a skill here
07:16 - and a skill here
07:17 - and just kind of break it up so that
07:19 - they're like separate you know words um
07:22 - and you know maybe even add a
07:25 - an icon to
07:27 - some of these skills like css sas
07:30 - babel
07:31 - redux reacts those all have their own
07:34 - uh
07:35 - logos and icons for those
07:38 - but um yeah overall looks good let's
07:40 - take a look at your work
07:42 - okay so that just scrolls down to
07:45 - there at the bottom
07:48 - okay i'm just gonna scroll back up to
07:50 - the about me
07:52 - um yeah same thing i recommended with
07:54 - previous text
07:59 - see now this this looks okay to the eye
08:01 - because
08:02 - uh you know this is a couple of
08:04 - sentences i think that looks decent
08:06 - and
08:08 - it looks like you were consistent about
08:11 - the um
08:12 - [Music]
08:13 - the capitalization on this as well so
08:16 - this you have as capital case unless you
08:18 - have this lower case that looks good
08:21 - um front end to back ends cool like the
08:23 - graphics
08:25 - uh
08:27 - would probably try to
08:30 - rewrite this a little bit just to make
08:31 - it a little bit shorter try to bring it
08:33 - down to
08:34 - maybe this much text
08:36 - same thing with this keep them
08:38 - relatively the same consistent length
08:41 - and
08:46 - i like that you write their skewb center
08:48 - rely on a lot of your text but i
08:50 - personally feel like you would best
08:52 - benefit from just having this as the
08:54 - center aligns to make it kind of
08:56 - stylistic and draw the eye down to the
08:58 - hire me button
09:00 - but then
09:01 - when it comes to
09:02 - to this text
09:04 - i would probably make it left aligned
09:06 - just so that it's easier to read
09:08 - same thing with skill set about me
09:12 - um
09:13 - and probably these blocks of code here
09:16 - maybe i would leave this uh center
09:18 - aligns just again because it's kind of a
09:20 - stylistic um you know like starting
09:23 - point
09:24 - but yeah that's just kind of personal
09:25 - preference
09:26 - uh let's see then you also have my work
09:32 - cool
09:33 - click on both of those
09:34 - um okay and the sections will work in
09:37 - progress so i'm not gonna um
09:40 - you know really dig too deeply into that
09:42 - i imagine you're probably going to have
09:43 - like a couple of
09:44 - uh twitter like cards or you know like a
09:47 - couple of blocks here for
09:49 - your different projects so that's cool
09:52 - um
09:54 - okay and these are a couple of projects
09:56 - that you just created that i'm checking
09:58 - out
09:59 - um okay so yeah i imagine you'd probably
10:02 - use something like that down here
10:05 - i love this really nice drop shadow on
10:07 - these items
10:11 - and same thing with this
10:13 - okay so you develop some some decent uis
10:16 - and overall your user experience is
10:19 - really good
10:21 - biggest thing honestly that i can see is
10:23 - just the the text throughout other than
10:25 - that it's a great portfolio good use of
10:28 - color good use
10:29 - fonts and
10:31 - good use of color contrast and overall
10:34 - layout
10:35 - all right so let's bring this up okay
10:37 - and i think this is just a
10:39 - a one pager so it's just going to bring
10:40 - you to each section i love that
10:42 - animation by the way
10:45 - okay that just brings that up
10:47 - and of course we have contact cool
10:50 - i'm gonna just go ahead and hit f12 on
10:52 - my keyboard ensure that this is set to
10:55 - uh iphone and just scroll back up to the
10:58 - top
10:59 - cool and it looks like it is a mobile
11:01 - first design
11:02 - um
11:05 - yep everything looks consistent here
11:08 - uh you probably did mobile first so i
11:09 - can see why you would want to center
11:11 - align that
11:12 - um
11:14 - but i would probably still go with left
11:16 - aligned on that
11:17 - uh
11:20 - now skill set this is definitely where
11:21 - it would come i think in handy to have
11:23 - like i said one of the two sentences and
11:25 - then kind of separate out some of your
11:27 - skills into icons or something of that
11:30 - nature just so it's not like a huge wall
11:32 - of text i know
11:34 - on desktop not only desktop but on
11:36 - mobile when i'm scrolling through things
11:38 - i don't want to have to read a giant
11:40 - wall of text uh same thing with that
11:44 - but again overall great job
11:46 - um
11:47 - [Music]
11:48 - cool well hey nice job man i
11:51 - uh really appreciate you sharing this
11:53 - portfolio with me i'm just going to go
11:55 - ahead and hit f12 again
11:57 - and to add a little bit more value to
11:59 - you because this is only running at
12:00 - about 12 minutes it's going to bring up
12:03 - a couple of your social profiles
12:05 - probably won't
12:07 - uh take a look at facebook just because
12:08 - i don't have a facebook account
12:11 - uh
12:11 - [Music]
12:14 - come on twitter
12:18 - cool looks like you're doing uh you know
12:20 - decent social social engagement you're
12:23 - posting things that
12:25 - are you know good saying so that's a
12:26 - great way to market yourself
12:29 - um
12:32 - i think for these one thing that i would
12:34 - do though is look for relevant hashtags
12:37 - that you can start using because that's
12:40 - really going to help you get additional
12:42 - exposure exposure excuse me for each one
12:44 - of these so
12:46 - see for example you you paste or excuse
12:48 - me post something like this on a monday
12:51 - i believe the 31st was on monday let me
12:53 - see
12:54 - yep
12:56 - excuse me so you could do
12:58 - something like motivation monday on that
13:00 - or um
13:02 - let's see today was wednesday so you
13:04 - could do like a wednesday wisdom
13:07 - on
13:08 - some of these other posts
13:10 - in addition to you know a bunch of other
13:12 - things like maybe quotes hashtag quote
13:14 - or what have you
13:16 - and um that'll help get you a little bit
13:18 - more exposure on twitter
13:21 - you typically want to strike a balance
13:23 - between the amount of hashtags and
13:26 - the the overall
13:27 - the size the content that you have but
13:29 - since these are images you can pretty
13:32 - much get away with using i would say
13:34 - close to 10 hashtags and it wouldn't
13:36 - really look too spammy
13:38 - just because the content is large again
13:40 - if you were just doing pretty much plain
13:42 - text without an image or
13:44 - you know doing like a video that only
13:46 - has like a little
13:47 - display link on it and then you would
13:49 - want to kind of shorten the amount of
13:50 - hashtags you use to
13:52 - uh something more conservative i would
13:54 - say like four maybe five just as a rule
13:57 - of thumb
13:58 - but uh yeah overall looks like you're
14:01 - retweeting people engaging and this is
14:03 - just kind of a surface level analysis
14:05 - but um
14:07 - yeah so far it looks pretty good
14:09 - so let me go ahead and pop over to
14:13 - your linkedin okay um
14:17 - would definitely recommend connecting
14:18 - with more people
14:20 - um
14:22 - i would definitely recommend using a
14:24 - personalized photo
14:26 - um
14:27 - and not listing
14:28 - unemployed um
14:30 - maybe a list uh freelancer or
14:33 - apprentice or something of that nature
14:35 - just showing that you're making progress
14:37 - um on whatever you're interested in in
14:40 - pursuing
14:41 - um now in terms of you know like
14:43 - self-taught
14:44 - um
14:45 - again i would probably elaborate on that
14:47 - you know if you've done things like free
14:49 - code camp or codecademy go ahead and
14:51 - list those they actually do have those
14:53 - as educational institutions on linkedin
14:56 - um
14:57 - and now
14:59 - perhaps i'm not being i'm not able to
15:01 - see your whole profile
15:03 - uh just because of some of the settings
15:05 - that you have because we're not
15:06 - connected on linkedin so that is a
15:08 - possibility as well
15:10 - um
15:11 - but yeah i would definitely recommend if
15:13 - you haven't done it to
15:15 - again set those institutions um
15:20 - maybe put in some volunteer work uh put
15:22 - in some other projects that you've
15:23 - worked on
15:24 - uh perhaps start writing some blog posts
15:27 - or articles that you can include in here
15:29 - and also include uh you know what you've
15:32 - been working on uh because you would
15:34 - mention that you're doing full stack
15:35 - rails and react um which is fantastic i
15:39 - mean if you've been doing that then
15:40 - definitely include some projects and
15:42 - uh some of those additional tools that i
15:44 - saw on your portfolio site in here um
15:47 - while linkedin isn't the best to land a
15:49 - job directly with someone it is
15:51 - fantastic to connect you with recruiters
15:54 - you know that's typically how i would
15:55 - say i probably get
15:57 - uh maybe a fifth of my job requests it's
16:00 - just through linkedin
16:01 - you know technical recruiters through
16:03 - linkedin so just a consideration but not
16:05 - something you have to focus on but um
16:08 - yeah i just want to say it was a
16:09 - pleasure thanks again for sharing your
16:12 - portfolio with me i'm excited to have
16:15 - the opportunity and um if you're
16:17 - watching and you like this video and
16:19 - you'd like a portfolio or resume review
16:21 - please feel free to check out the link
16:23 - in the description would be happy to
16:24 - provide that to you for free with the
16:26 - little uh
16:27 - caveat of uh you know i'm able to post
16:30 - it on my youtube channel i'm able to
16:32 - repost it on
16:33 - free code camp and other
16:36 - code instructional youtube channels as
16:39 - well just so i can provide more value to
16:40 - people
16:42 - but i also do have a private option if
16:44 - you want to go ahead and do that i can
16:46 - do it privately for you however i do
16:48 - charge for that
16:49 - well once again this is benjamin's back
16:51 - just want to say thanks for watching and
16:54 - hopefully i'll see you in another video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys benjamin's back here thanks for tuning in uh so i'm just doing a quick portfolio review for uh nasir i believe is how you pronounce it i'm gonna do just the desktop and the mobile version of it uh just give my first impressions on the overall responsiveness some of the animations the font the layout etc etc um i think i'm also going to go ahead and reviews his social media presence as well just as a little added bonus um you know hopefully he appreciates that uh but yeah he had reached out to me on twitter i introduced him to the uh codecareer.org discord community which you can just get to by going to codecareer.org discord and uh in there he got some decent feedback from one of our admins alex and he'll also be getting a little bit of feedback from me so anyway without further ado let's go to dive in so at first right off the bat he has a nice introduction says hi i'm the seer uh let's see okay dig that um i love performance as much as expert and i try to be my best to create ux rich performance websites and web apps okay um i suppose the only thing i see here is if um if you're gonna if nasir is going to do um you know capital case where like each letter um of each word is capitalized then i would ideally apply that rule to anything that's four letters or more so it would capitalize much and capitalize create personally though i think i would prefer in on my own website just to have everything uh you know a standard case so you just have like the eyes capitalized and then all of the other letters under here are lowercase i feel like that adds a better contrast between the header here and then the the subheader or description because this is quite a bit of text i would kind of regard it as a description um so i just kind of like to see that contrast personally but um overall good cool and it looks like you have a nice nifty animation here when you go ahead and hover over that dig that and it looks like it comes as a popup all right i like the popup the font is nice the overall layout here is great i like the separation of colors dig that animation that's good uh let's see grab my cv find out more about me all right just take a quick look at this okay cool uh okay going back um one thing i might recommend is keep well that's excuse me on second thought i do actually like the color difference of the footer here and the the button because it does cause the button to stay up or stand out i was initially going to recommend keeping these the same color but i like what you did there um i think the one thing i would recommend is maybe changing this font playing with it just a little bit maybe making it a little bit brighter you know a little bit more of like a whitish color just to make your key details stand out but at the

back to these being uppercase um just looks a little strange at first glance so that's one thing i think i would address um again love the animation though let me go ahead and click that cool and that brings you right to twitter alright and your skill set again probably the same feedback in terms of uh you know breaking this out making it look a little bit more readable um one to two sentences per paragraph again same thing with the text um you know staying consistent with the the capital case uh setup that you have or lowercase setup um another thing you could do i do actually like the overall readability of this like just peppering in or or putting in your skill sets in in text i like that i like the the dotting that you use for the underlining maybe though i would write like a paragraph or so about your skills like right here and then kind of like list some of your skills so like one to you know like um under that so i have like a skill here and a skill here and just kind of break it up so that they're like separate you know words um and you know maybe even add a an icon to some of these skills like css sas babel redux reacts those all have their own uh logos and icons for those but um yeah overall looks good let's take a look at your work okay so that just scrolls down to there at the bottom okay i'm just gonna scroll back up to the about me um yeah same thing i recommended with previous text see now this this looks okay to the eye because uh you know this is a couple of sentences i think that looks decent and it looks like you were consistent about the um the capitalization on this as well so this you have as capital case unless you have this lower case that looks good um front end to back ends cool like the graphics uh would probably try to rewrite this a little bit just to make it a little bit shorter try to bring it down to maybe this much text same thing with this keep them relatively the same consistent length and i like that you write their skewb center rely on a lot of your text but i personally feel like you would best benefit from just having this as the center aligns to make it kind of stylistic and draw the eye down to the hire me button but then when it comes to to this text i would probably make it left aligned just so that it's easier to read same thing with skill set about me um and probably these blocks of code here maybe i would leave this uh center aligns just again because it's kind of a stylistic um you know like starting point but yeah that's just kind of personal preference uh let's see then you also have my work cool click on both of those um okay and the sections will work in progress so i'm not gonna um you know really dig too deeply into that i imagine you're probably going to have like a couple of uh twitter like cards or you know like a couple of blocks here for your different projects so that's cool um okay and these are a couple of projects that you just created that i'm checking out um okay so yeah i imagine you'd probably use something like that down here i love this really nice drop shadow on these items and same thing with this okay so you develop some some decent uis and overall your user experience is really good biggest thing honestly that i can see is just the the text throughout other than that it's a great portfolio good use of color good use fonts and good use of color contrast and overall layout all right so let's bring this up okay and i think this is just a a one pager so it's just going to bring you to each section i love that animation by the way okay that just brings that up and of course we have contact cool i'm gonna just go ahead and hit f12 on my keyboard ensure that this is set to uh iphone and just scroll back up to the top cool and it looks like it is a mobile first design um yep everything looks consistent here uh you probably did mobile first so i can see why you would want to center align that um but i would probably still go with left aligned on that uh now skill set this is definitely where it would come i think in handy to have like i said one of the two sentences and then kind of separate out some of your skills into icons or something of that nature just so it's not like a huge wall of text i know on desktop not only desktop but on mobile when i'm scrolling through things i don't want to have to read a giant wall of text uh same thing with that but again overall great job um cool well hey nice job man i uh really appreciate you sharing this portfolio with me i'm just going to go ahead and hit f12 again and to add a little bit more value to you because this is only running at about 12 minutes it's going to bring up a couple of your social profiles probably won't uh take a look at facebook just because i don't have a facebook account uh come on twitter cool looks like you're doing uh you know decent social social engagement you're posting things that are you know good saying so that's a great way to market yourself um i think for these one thing that i would do though is look for relevant hashtags that you can start using because that's really going to help you get additional exposure exposure excuse me for each one of these so see for example you you paste or excuse me post something like this on a monday i believe the 31st was on monday let me see yep excuse me so you could do something like motivation monday on that or um let's see today was wednesday so you could do like a wednesday wisdom on some of these other posts in addition to you know a bunch of other things like maybe quotes hashtag quote or what have you and um that'll help get you a little bit more exposure on twitter you typically want to strike a balance between the amount of hashtags and the the overall the size the content that you have but since these are images you can pretty much get away with using i would say close to 10 hashtags and it wouldn't really look too spammy just because the content is large again if you were just doing pretty much plain text without an image or you know doing like a video that only has like a little display link on it and then you would want to kind of shorten the amount of hashtags you use to uh something more conservative i would say like four maybe five just as a rule of thumb but uh yeah overall looks like you're retweeting people engaging and this is just kind of a surface level analysis but um yeah so far it looks pretty good so let me go ahead and pop over to your linkedin okay um would definitely recommend connecting with more people um i would definitely recommend using a personalized photo um and not listing unemployed um maybe a list uh freelancer or apprentice or something of that nature just showing that you're making progress um on whatever you're interested in in pursuing um now in terms of you know like selftaught um again i would probably elaborate on that you know if you've done things like free code camp or codecademy go ahead and list those they actually do have those as educational institutions on linkedin um and now perhaps i'm not being i'm not able to see your whole profile uh just because of some of the settings that you have because we're not connected on linkedin so that is a possibility as well um but yeah i would definitely recommend if you haven't done it to again set those institutions um maybe put in some volunteer work uh put in some other projects that you've worked on uh perhaps start writing some blog posts or articles that you can include in here and also include uh you know what you've been working on uh because you would mention that you're doing full stack rails and react um which is fantastic i mean if you've been doing that then definitely include some projects and uh some of those additional tools that i saw on your portfolio site in here um while linkedin isn't the best to land a job directly with someone it is fantastic to connect you with recruiters you know that's typically how i would say i probably get uh maybe a fifth of my job requests it's just through linkedin you know technical recruiters through linkedin so just a consideration but not something you have to focus on but um yeah i just want to say it was a pleasure thanks again for sharing your portfolio with me i'm excited to have the opportunity and um if you're watching and you like this video and you'd like a portfolio or resume review please feel free to check out the link in the description would be happy to provide that to you for free with the little uh caveat of uh you know i'm able to post it on my youtube channel i'm able to repost it on free code camp and other code instructional youtube channels as well just so i can provide more value to people but i also do have a private option if you want to go ahead and do that i can do it privately for you however i do charge for that well once again this is benjamin's back just want to say thanks for watching and hopefully i'll see you in another video
