00:21 - i mean i and i'm just like i'm pumped
00:22 - because i i have joked many times that
00:25 - you are like the most interesting person
00:27 - in tech um because it seems like
00:31 - every time
00:33 - i mention anything like i'll be like oh
00:36 - yeah i'm working on like a part of my
00:39 - kitchen you're like oh yeah back when i
00:41 - was a plumber um
00:43 - and so you just you kind of have like
00:45 - this
00:46 - incredibly diverse background in terms
00:49 - of where you
00:51 - what you've done for jobs what you've
00:53 - done for work um so i guess to start
00:56 - maybe we can we can um tee it off with
00:58 - where you are
01:00 - now what's your current role
01:04 - i am um
01:05 - at this company called netlify i'm not
01:08 - sure if you've heard of it
01:09 - uh nice to meet you by the way
01:15 - i am on the the dx team uh mostly
01:18 - working with angular and then a bunch of
01:20 - really fun internal products like uh jam
01:24 - stack explorers so that's where i
01:26 - currently am
01:27 - absolutely um and so this uh to me this
01:31 - is like
01:33 - this is the perfect show for you because
01:35 - i feel like
01:38 - sorry hold on let me just take a second
01:39 - to congratulate myself on the brilliance
01:41 - of
01:43 - my name is jason i made this show and
01:45 - it's perfect
01:47 - let me tell you more
01:49 - but to so let me qualify that what i
01:51 - mean by this is that this show is
01:53 - actually um it's the result of a
01:55 - conversation that you and i had which
01:57 - was um we were talking about
02:00 - how
02:01 - the skills that we build when we work in
02:04 - different jobs translate so well into
02:07 - tech in really unexpected ways and so in
02:09 - the past you know you and i have both
02:11 - had non non-traditional like we're not
02:14 - you you don't have a cs degree right
02:17 - i do you do oh my god you get more and
02:20 - more interesting okay all right well
02:22 - maybe i should let you tell your own
02:24 - story then
02:24 - [Laughter]
02:28 - isn't that isn't that ridiculous though
02:30 - i mean it's uh it's it's funny because
02:34 - it's actually from the harvard extension
02:36 - school
02:37 - uh and i
02:39 - i got it because
02:42 - i met so i'm a business school dropout i
02:44 - tried to go to business school i failed
02:47 - so miserably
02:48 - that they were because i was like oh
02:51 - these business classes aren't fun i'm
02:52 - just going to go to my
02:54 - math classes and ceramics and
02:57 - classical guitar classes and they're
02:58 - like yeah you can't do that and i was
03:01 - like oh
03:02 - um so
03:04 - i dropped out of there and then ended up
03:07 - working um
03:09 - at harvard and so i
03:12 - uh
03:14 - got they have this tap program tuition
03:17 - assistance program so you can take
03:18 - courses for twenty dollars at their
03:20 - extension school as long as you can like
03:22 - get in
03:23 - and uh
03:25 - i just kept being like i started with
03:27 - there's like a physical and screen based
03:29 - computing
03:30 - class that was actually through mit
03:32 - uh but we were allowed to take it and i
03:35 - liked it so much i they used processing
03:38 - with java it was when processing was
03:40 - like kind of new ish so it was only used
03:42 - with java and so i was like oh i want to
03:44 - be better at making silly designs i
03:46 - should learn java
03:48 - and so that's how i learned java
03:54 - and from there they were like well you
03:55 - could be better at this if you learn
03:57 - data structures and i was like okay in
03:59 - order to make my really stupid silly
04:01 - electronics video games i am going to
04:03 - continue to learn data structures
04:06 - and it just went from there and
04:07 - eventually i had a cs degree
04:09 - jeez yeah okay
04:11 - uh
04:12 - every time we talk i learned something
04:13 - new um
04:18 - but so uh so what are some of the other
04:20 - jobs that you've held uh in addition to
04:22 - being a coder
04:25 - so i was actually looking back and i
04:28 - haven't had a break from
04:31 - the okay
04:33 - so i've started working in 1995 and the
04:37 - longest break i've ever had without a
04:39 - job was the maternity leave that i took
04:43 - about two years ago
04:45 - so and sometimes i've like overlapped
04:48 - jobs
04:49 - um and it's funny because thinking about
04:50 - like my first office job was when i
04:53 - sound so ridiculous when i was 12 years
04:55 - old
04:56 - um because
04:58 - you can't work until you're 14
05:00 - in
05:01 - ohio
05:02 - but i or is is i don't know is that
05:04 - everywhere
05:05 - i think it's different from state to
05:07 - state
05:08 - okay
05:09 - so i but i had a taste of it because i
05:12 - had started my own wagon business
05:14 - obviously
05:15 - um and which first i
05:18 - was
05:18 - which i took pumpkin rolls around to
05:20 - business districts and sold them
05:23 - inside of the little you know where it's
05:24 - like a brick log building and there's
05:26 - like 18 businesses in there so i did
05:29 - that um and so you know door-to-door
05:32 - pumpkin roll sales as one does when
05:34 - they're that old uh and then i painted
05:36 - curbs and stuff and this was all because
05:39 - i wanted to
05:41 - buy a flute
05:44 - okay so
05:45 - i
05:46 - so at that point i was just like learned
05:48 - okay
05:49 - i need money to get things
05:52 - therefore
05:54 - i like sell goods
05:56 - um
05:57 - and then from there i was just like you
05:59 - know this isn't enough i need more money
06:02 - [Laughter]
06:14 - but then so my grandmother was like well
06:16 - come to barberlin foods and you can be
06:18 - my payroll assistant you really like
06:20 - math so um you can do payroll for
06:23 - everybody and the funniest thing is like
06:25 - i learned really good people skills
06:27 - there because my grandma is such a
06:28 - little schmoozer
06:30 - uh she used to be
06:32 - yeah so she like did she did a lot of
06:34 - office management work for a while and
06:35 - then when she retired she became a
06:37 - bartender at the vfw
06:39 - as grandmas do
06:41 - um
06:42 - and
06:44 - so she was like the thing that you have
06:45 - to understand is
06:47 - people just want you to
06:49 - listen to them if you listen to them
06:52 - and you genuinely find something to care
06:56 - about
06:57 - like of them
06:59 - then they'll
07:01 - they'll warm up to you faster and
07:03 - they'll give you the better benefit of
07:05 - the doubt um and it's funny because
07:07 - she's uh known as being quite a like
07:09 - cold sarcastic woman
07:12 - and she was doing that to her own
07:14 - advantage but when i learned that i
07:17 - learned it as such a
07:20 - like real genuine trait that i really
07:23 - have when i meet people
07:26 - i want to hear more about them and then
07:28 - i just like even if they're people that
07:31 - aren't the most likable people i always
07:33 - try to find at least one thing that i
07:35 - find uh
07:37 - either like very intriguing or it's
07:40 - something i like about them and always
07:42 - try to keep that in mind at the
07:43 - forefront
07:44 - uh which has helped me a lot in the tech
07:47 - industry
07:49 - i can imagine
07:50 - um
07:52 - so so that's fascinating so that was
07:53 - like that takes us up to what you were
07:55 - 13.
07:56 - [Laughter]
07:58 - so uh this is this is a five-hour
08:00 - episode right
08:04 - um but so so along the way you you so
08:07 - you started out you you had you know
08:09 - your your pumpkin roll business um you
08:13 - you work doing the books and then you
08:17 - you've like
08:18 - you ended up at some point doing like
08:20 - you were driving a forklift right
08:24 - so that's actually like
08:29 - 13 years later or is that right maybe
08:33 - maybe like 12 or something
08:35 - um so i've had a lot of uh retail
08:38 - experience and um through a lot of
08:40 - different uh companies like like looking
08:43 - through the list it's been like a lot of
08:45 - like food and retail things uh i worked
08:48 - at subway target texas roadhouse panera
08:50 - bridge chipotle pacific summer urban
08:52 - outfitters and bigs
08:55 - this is the one where i was doing the
08:57 - forklift because
08:58 - i was working in um the garden center
09:02 - okay so i would get all of the pallets
09:05 - uh back and forth of mulch and stone and
09:07 - everything
09:09 - but i think like one of the things that
09:10 - i learned the most
09:12 - from those jobs that has helped me a lot
09:15 - is
09:17 - like from the retail jobs in particular
09:19 - is that
09:21 - uh customer service and common sense
09:23 - go hand in hand
09:25 - and
09:27 - i think that uh there you just have to
09:29 - have
09:31 - the only emotion that you should have in
09:34 - customer service is empathy
09:37 - because if you get angry
09:39 - if you if you just say if you feel
09:41 - attacked if you get defensive
09:43 - that's going to take you nowhere fast
09:46 - and it's funny because i think like
09:48 - especially with working with open source
09:50 - software
09:51 - that has really
09:53 - helped me a ton
09:55 - because
09:56 - it's so easy for me to get defensive
09:59 - about my code
10:02 - but when somebody is saying like
10:05 - this isn't working for me and why did
10:07 - you write it this way and
10:09 - i have to remember how frustrated i get
10:11 - when i use libraries and i say
10:14 - why did they do it this way this does
10:15 - not work this api is so it's bonkers
10:18 - it's backwards whatever
10:20 - um
10:21 - and so when i see things coming my way i
10:24 - know i don't want
10:25 - an author of a plugin to be like i'm not
10:27 - gonna help you because
10:29 - uh you know
10:31 - you're a jerk
10:33 - or you know
10:34 - there's a
10:36 - and
10:36 - it's like so it's like i don't want to
10:38 - be a jerk and i don't want to be a jerk
10:40 - to you and there's been multiple times
10:41 - um especially in issues and stuff where
10:43 - people are like your product sucks this
10:46 - is stupid what are you doing this is
10:48 - awful
10:49 - and so i just come back and i think
10:51 - about it and i
10:52 - try it like but keep my best to like
10:56 - um
10:56 - take myself out of that situation like
10:58 - like i did when i was like doing target
11:01 - returns
11:03 - and they're like your stupid store said
11:05 - that i had to bring this back
11:08 - and i'm like okay
11:10 - i see this is really frustrating because
11:13 - you need this thing to work
11:14 - and you know i just
11:16 - you know i'm here one-on-one with you
11:18 - how can we make this work
11:21 - and just drop all that drama part of it
11:23 - to see if we can get to a solution
11:26 - and that like writing back to people's
11:28 - angry issues like that i've had so many
11:30 - times where people come back and they go
11:32 - oh you know i was really upset sorry for
11:35 - the things that i said yeah here's my
11:38 - problem here's the code what can we do
11:40 - yeah but that's hard
11:42 - there's a lot of emotion in code we
11:44 - write and and like what you're talking
11:46 - about too it um it kind of reminds me of
11:48 - like you know
11:50 - they say that uh like the laws of
11:52 - thermodynamics like every every action
11:54 - has an equal and opposite reaction right
11:57 - what i've found though is that in human
11:58 - interactions that's not true
12:00 - human interactions tend to mirror each
12:02 - other which is why when somebody comes
12:04 - at you hard and you get defensive if you
12:06 - go back it will get
12:08 - really contentious but if somebody comes
12:10 - at you hard and you don't
12:12 - you you like just let the the anger wash
12:15 - over you and you just respond as
12:17 - measured as you can and and like nothing
12:20 - comes back so it's really hard for them
12:22 - to stay mad like it's really hard you
12:24 - know what i mean it's that whole idea of
12:25 - like it's so hard to like
12:29 - attack somebody who's peaceful like
12:31 - peaceful resistance kind of thing like
12:32 - so if somebody's coming at you
12:34 - you know and you just say
12:36 - i understand and i want to help
12:38 - uh no
12:40 - you don't know the person who's
12:43 - coming at you
12:44 - um
12:49 - oh sorry i think i had a little delay
12:52 - you're fine you're back
12:54 - okay bye
12:55 - am i here
12:56 - um
12:57 - so i was just gonna say that i think we
13:00 - talk about this or we don't talk about
13:02 - this enough but just like understanding
13:04 - that
13:05 - our jobs aren't our whole lives and so
13:07 - when people come at you angry
13:09 - you don't know where they're coming from
13:12 - and so i did americorps national
13:14 - civilian community court and we did
13:16 - katrina disaster relief so
13:18 - right right after all the floods we went
13:21 - down and we like gutted houses um
13:24 - and you know worked at different
13:26 - volunteer bases and
13:28 - basically like just
13:30 - entrenched ourselves in these areas that
13:32 - were just
13:33 - demolished
13:34 - and uh
13:36 - you had it was hard to because you would
13:38 - get so desensitized from living in these
13:40 - areas it was hard to remember what
13:43 - people were going through so we would
13:44 - have like i remember having a situation
13:47 - where i was uh
13:48 - in one of the volunteer camps and this
13:50 - guy came in and he was like
13:53 - just went off on us
13:55 - uh because our truck was parked in front
13:57 - of his driveway
13:59 - and we didn't even know anybody was
14:01 - there so we were just like
14:04 - huh
14:05 - and he was
14:06 - screaming and i don't do well with
14:08 - people screaming
14:09 - uh
14:10 - but
14:11 - i had
14:13 - at first we were all just like what how
14:15 - dare you like
14:16 - sorry
14:18 - that's my dog um
14:20 - but then
14:22 - you realize like oh yeah this guy
14:24 - doesn't have a place to live anymore
14:26 - he's coming home to his house being
14:28 - completely and you can't even get in the
14:30 - driveway now and so i think about that
14:33 - kind of mindset when
14:36 - you know people come at you
14:38 - already at a level 10
14:40 - and you're just like dude
14:42 - all it was is that you know that part of
14:45 - the module needed installed like why are
14:48 - you yelling already
14:50 - and then you're just like oh yeah your
14:52 - boss is yelling at you to get this done
14:54 - immediately and their boss is yelling at
14:56 - them and like there's a whole trickle
14:59 - down
15:00 - and you just know that yelling is
15:02 - happening and you should be yelling too
15:07 - and i also think like
15:09 - in open source there's this this
15:11 - tendency where like in the early days of
15:13 - open source it's really fun because when
15:14 - you're a maintainer everybody who's
15:16 - coming to your library is they're
15:18 - voluntarily there they want to try
15:19 - something out there they're there to
15:21 - learn and to like be part of a community
15:24 - later as something gets popular like you
15:26 - know if you're a webpack maintainer
15:27 - right now most of the people in the
15:29 - webpack issues they're not there because
15:30 - they wanted to learn webpack they're
15:32 - there because they inherited a project
15:34 - and they're on a deadline and something
15:35 - is broken and they don't understand it
15:37 - and they didn't write this code to begin
15:38 - with and they're furious that they have
15:40 - to deal with this problem because they
15:42 - don't feel like it should be their
15:43 - problem and unfortunately you as the
15:45 - maintainer are the person standing right
15:48 - in front of them when they're having
15:49 - this realization
15:52 - and uh i think yeah i mean i i love i
15:54 - love that way of framing it though
15:55 - because if you think about the fact that
15:57 - people don't exist in a vacuum you know
15:59 - if you if you assume that people exist
16:01 - when they're outside of your your field
16:03 - of view
16:04 - they've got whole stories they've got
16:05 - whole lives going on and and the thing
16:07 - that's happening to you right now has
16:09 - very little to do with you if this isn't
16:10 - somebody you know
16:12 - exactly exactly and it's funny because
16:15 - you know like they say software is easy
16:17 - people are hard
16:19 - and i think
16:20 - i think that a lot that a lot that i
16:22 - learned from getting my cs degree is um
16:26 - and i i
16:28 - so i was really lucky my mom taught
16:30 - electronics at the local community
16:31 - college and so when i would get out of
16:34 - school i would go to her cl like her
16:36 - electronics lab and just fiddle around
16:38 - with breadboards and stuff so i got
16:40 - taught the mindset of logical thinking
16:43 - uh thanks to that really uh analog
16:46 - procedure of like this thing is feeding
16:48 - this thing and it can only get these
16:50 - instructions it can only be on or off
16:52 - and where is that on or off going and
16:53 - who is it telling us what's on and off
16:56 - so i was really lucky to have that kind
16:58 - of like logical mindset
17:00 - pretty early on
17:02 - and then that got really reinforced once
17:04 - i started going through uh all my cs
17:07 - courses and it's kind of like
17:09 - which i think you can learn from not
17:11 - even just classes but doing
17:14 - uh development work in general
17:16 - um but i definitely saw when the switch
17:21 - flipped you know when you're like you're
17:22 - making dinner after coating something
17:25 - out and you're like
17:28 - pot turn boil
17:30 - water boil when water boils pasta
17:34 - [Laughter]
17:37 - what's happened to my brain
17:40 - and it's just like i remember just
17:42 - thinking of like my dog's different
17:43 - methods and i was just like oh what's
17:46 - happening
17:48 - but
17:50 - that is such a
17:52 - that's a factor in a development job
17:55 - the human communication that has to go
17:59 - to make a functioning team and a
18:01 - functioning product
18:02 - is something that like you don't have to
18:05 - have 38 jobs like i have had
18:09 - but it definitely helps to have
18:12 - such a mixture of one like
18:15 - working or dealing with both people that
18:18 - you need to manage
18:20 - people that are on your
18:21 - all people that you need to manage
18:24 - people that are on your team and people
18:25 - that are managing you
18:27 - and i think i learned a ton from the
18:29 - different kinds of jobs i had and the
18:32 - different responsibilities i had in each
18:33 - of those jobs
18:36 - um so i i'm gonna make one quick comment
18:38 - which is that when you when you're
18:40 - talking about your your uh
18:42 - like writing the code for making pasta
18:45 - the italians in chat are very grateful
18:47 - that you said when water then pasta
18:52 - which
18:53 - i also
18:54 - uh well done um but uh another question
18:58 - so there was a question earlier you
19:00 - talked about getting your css your cs
19:02 - degree and when you were learning data
19:04 - structures and pranav asks uh how is
19:07 - your experience learning data structures
19:09 - and and like what of that do you find
19:10 - has been important in your in your roles
19:13 - or in your career i guess
19:16 - it's funny because it was definitely a
19:18 - lot of
19:19 - you know now i didn't it wasn't that
19:22 - long ago that i went to school but now
19:24 - they have so many hilarious resources
19:27 - like
19:28 - uh like bubble sort square dancing
19:30 - videos and i saw that
19:36 - and i'm like oh yeah that would make i
19:38 - had a real i had a really great teacher
19:41 - um and and so
19:44 - he did a lot of things like the whole
19:46 - tearing of the notebook
19:47 - uh to kind of
19:49 - show you different kinds of ways to like
19:52 - sort
19:53 - uh that class was by far one of my
19:55 - hardest because i had only done like
19:58 - intro to java before then so
20:00 - that like logical mindset wasn't
20:02 - completely ingrained in me
20:05 - it's funny to think how i use it now
20:07 - because
20:08 - i'm not
20:11 - anytime i need to do a data structure or
20:12 - some kind of like principle along those
20:15 - lines i go back to reference constantly
20:17 - so there's nothing in my head that i'm
20:19 - yeah then i'm this like oh well it's
20:21 - obviously this because of that
20:24 - um that's cassidy cassidy is the one
20:26 - that does that
20:28 - um
20:30 - it's cassidy williams that we're
20:31 - referring to
20:34 - obviously um
20:36 - but uh i do
20:39 - i do have that mindset though of like
20:41 - yeah we're we're setting um
20:44 - we have to have these different markers
20:46 - to understand what is the best process
20:49 - to make this faster and like we were
20:51 - talking about this in um on remotely
20:52 - interesting a podcast we do uh skype
20:55 - weird guy jason's on there too
20:58 - and we talked about rendering in this
21:00 - one episode and it's funny because in
21:03 - everything we have these markers so like
21:05 - we have uh like you know time to first
21:08 - contentful paint and like time like
21:11 - we're all we're marking everything so
21:13 - that we have a system to understand
21:16 - what how it's going to be better for our
21:18 - users
21:19 - and so it's more that
21:22 - i'm not bringing any data structures
21:24 - with me on a daily basis but it's more
21:26 - that mindset of like our there is an
21:29 - algorithm to figure out how to make this
21:31 - best for our users and that mentality
21:34 - has definitely stuck through and through
21:37 - the rest of that class though
21:40 - i mean i so i i don't have a cs degree
21:42 - but what i what i have found about
21:44 - things like algorithms data structures
21:45 - that type of study
21:47 - is
21:48 - i very rarely am looking at that
21:51 - information and saying that's exactly
21:52 - what i'm going to do to solve this
21:54 - problem but what i what i found is that
21:57 - having that around in the back of my
21:58 - mind when i look at a problem i at least
22:01 - have a list of things to like thumb
22:03 - through and go is that kind of like this
22:04 - is that kind of like this and then i can
22:06 - go i at least know what to google right
22:09 - and i think that's been probably the
22:11 - most beneficial part of any of that more
22:13 - academic learning for me has been it it
22:16 - gives me vocabulary that lets me google
22:18 - more effectively
22:21 - yeah yeah which is i mean it's it's
22:23 - hilarious to me when i try to tell
22:25 - people just how much googling is part of
22:27 - our job like
22:29 - and
22:30 - it's funny because that's another one
22:33 - that i've learned through so many
22:35 - different jobs is
22:38 - to ask for help
22:40 - not just like searching things on the
22:43 - web but it's like
22:45 - it takes a lot of humility
22:48 - to
22:49 - one admit you did something wrong
22:52 - and then on top of it ask for help
22:55 - um but it's just it's totally clutch
22:58 - like
22:59 - you
23:00 - nobody's perfect and uh if you are turns
23:03 - out you're wrong
23:08 - so uh but but it's definitely like
23:11 - through the years i've definitely had to
23:12 - like
23:14 - tell myself remind myself that it's just
23:16 - like okay
23:18 - you even about things that don't have
23:21 - like a specific right answer just
23:23 - knowing that you may think this is the
23:25 - best way to go about doing something
23:28 - but you're not working in a silo
23:30 - so
23:32 - you have to like i remember the first
23:34 - time our
23:36 - uh our
23:37 - the vp of development experience at
23:41 - netlify sarah drazner said to disagree
23:45 - and commit
23:46 - i just remember being like oh
23:48 - what
23:53 - and then it's just like oh yeah because
23:56 - team
23:57 - like company business
23:59 - it's like yeah it makes sense like
24:01 - you've got to do that in your daily life
24:03 - i've also been in a relationship for
24:05 - like
24:07 - too long what 12 years or something
24:10 - oh 14. um
24:12 - and i mean half at least three quarters
24:14 - of the relationship is disagreeing
24:16 - commit so
24:18 - you learn from everywhere in your life
24:21 - yeah well and actually i think that's
24:23 - kind of a so you mentioned one thing
24:25 - that i think is really hard to start
24:28 - because especially when you're new in
24:30 - your career
24:31 - the idea of of
24:33 - admitting that you don't know something
24:34 - that can feel like it's gonna be the
24:36 - giveaway that gets you
24:38 - like thrown out you know it's like oh
24:39 - they're gonna realize that i don't know
24:40 - what i'm doing
24:42 - for for you how
24:45 - like how was that experience and like
24:47 - how did what experiences did you have
24:48 - that helped you overcome that fear of
24:50 - saying like hey i don't know how to do
24:51 - this who who can help me
24:54 - i've always liked to learn um and having
24:59 - having the
25:02 - having the craving to learn has over
25:04 - compensated that whole pride thing um
25:08 - and but it was definitely something that
25:10 - i learned i realized that i made a
25:12 - better uh
25:14 - team member
25:16 - in
25:16 - in the develop in the dev world because
25:19 - i had uh
25:23 - i had learned a lot so much from all the
25:25 - other jobs that i've been on like i
25:27 - didn't know how to
25:29 - like
25:30 - um
25:31 - so i like renovated a house recently and
25:33 - like i didn't know the proper way to
25:36 - like cut and install drywall how to do
25:38 - plumbing how the different angles matter
25:40 - if you actually want your poop to go
25:42 - down
25:43 - um
25:47 - so
25:49 - so it's definitely a lot of being like
25:52 - there's something like i had the the
25:54 - overseer of of doing a lot of the
25:56 - construction work uh i i worked with
25:59 - habitat for humanity for a little while
26:01 - and we actually built houses on the um
26:05 - on the uh mall in dc okay so it was like
26:09 - this really cool event where they had 12
26:11 - houses and we built them on the mall and
26:13 - then they got on trucks and moved them
26:15 - out to different places around like
26:17 - anacostia and the area
26:19 - that was so cool
26:21 - and uh the foreman on the project
26:25 - was so
26:26 - mean
26:28 - and you don't really expect it for like
26:30 - these programs that are like
26:33 - let's all work together
26:35 - um
26:36 - and he just expected you to know
26:37 - everything
26:39 - and so
26:40 - we would be putting things together and
26:42 - i'm like i don't know how to do this but
26:44 - the last thing you want to go is like go
26:46 - up to the bully and be like i'm dumb
26:49 - because he just was like what do you
26:50 - mean you don't know how to frame a house
26:53 - and i'm like i'm
26:56 - i don't know i also had like 16 jello
26:59 - shots last night so
27:01 - let's work together um
27:03 - but
27:04 - i feel like when when you have that
27:06 - experience of just like
27:08 - okay this is the boss right like the
27:10 - boss in a video game
27:12 - but like
27:13 - his defense is like being a jerk to you
27:17 - and then how you're gonna or like his
27:19 - attack is being a jerk to you and then
27:20 - your defense is just like
27:24 - taking it and knowing that he
27:27 - has not doesn't know anything about you
27:29 - he can't really change your life in any
27:32 - horrible way so the only thing that can
27:36 - happen here is that i can just
27:39 - let those things slide off me and learn
27:41 - what i need to learn
27:43 - and that's an extreme situation like
27:45 - hopefully not a lot of people are like
27:47 - having insults thrown at them as they're
27:49 - trying to hammer two by fours together
27:52 - but uh
27:53 - it made me even be better at like the
27:56 - first dev job i had
27:58 - um i kind i like i knew what i was doing
28:01 - but i had always worked with uh i was
28:03 - like switching to do more back end work
28:07 - and i was also unfamiliar with
28:09 - infrastructure and so it would look like
28:11 - i knew what i was doing so my managers
28:13 - would be like yeah that's right just
28:14 - keep doing what you're doing i'm like it
28:16 - looks like i know what i'm doing but i
28:18 - don't
28:19 - so explain this to me on this selection
28:21 - and this section is if i don't know what
28:23 - i'm doing right and i felt like that was
28:25 - a really good thing that i'm glad i had
28:27 - in my toolbox um to even say like
28:32 - yeah sure you think i'm doing it right
28:35 - but i'm not
28:37 - i i don't know what i'm doing
28:40 - um because that's hard it's hard one to
28:42 - just say you don't know what you're
28:43 - doing
28:44 - and especially when you're new and
28:46 - you're like they could they just brought
28:47 - me on
28:48 - like they could get rid of me if they
28:50 - wanted but it's also it's really good to
28:53 - remember i'm gonna take a breath talking
28:55 - after this point
28:59 - it's good to remember with both um
29:02 - like many things in life but development
29:05 - and definitely speaking
29:07 - like doing talks
29:09 - especially technical talks people don't
29:12 - want to see you fail
29:13 - like
29:15 - 97.63 people
29:17 - don't want to see you fail
29:19 - it's extremely awkward as an audience
29:21 - member it's very uh
29:25 - it's not it's not what managers want to
29:27 - see
29:28 - so they're rooting for you when it comes
29:30 - down to it so if they can find a way to
29:32 - help you succeed as a manager the
29:34 - audience can't
29:36 - if they can find a way to help you
29:37 - succeed as one of their employees that's
29:39 - what they want to do so if you can give
29:41 - them
29:42 - what they need to let them know what you
29:44 - need to succeed right like it's making
29:47 - everybody happier nobody yeah nobody
29:49 - wants to see you fail so
29:51 - yeah well and really like if somebody
29:53 - hired you it's gonna look really bad on
29:56 - them
29:57 - if the person they hired
29:59 - is like not equipped to do the job so
30:01 - it's in there like even just selfishly
30:03 - it's in your manager your your
30:05 - employer's best interest to train you so
30:08 - you know and if they do want to see you
30:09 - fail you don't want to work there yeah
30:12 - fair enough right
30:13 - um but so so we've been kind of talking
30:15 - like this is this is a lot of abstract
30:17 - stuff that i think is really really
30:18 - helpful but um for a lot of folks
30:21 - watching this stream um they're in free
30:24 - code camp and a lot of those folks are
30:26 - looking for their first role
30:28 - so
30:29 - when you are
30:30 - like i know that you do a decent amount
30:32 - of mentorship i know that you work with
30:33 - a lot of communities um
30:36 - you you've been in the industry for a
30:38 - while so i don't i mean i have a hard
30:39 - time remembering how i got my first role
30:41 - outside of like i did a thing and then i
30:42 - had a job but um but
30:45 - what advice do you have like
30:48 - the industry is flooded right now there
30:50 - are a lot of people looking for their
30:51 - first job there's also a little bit of
30:54 - constriction due to the pandemic
30:56 - companies are looking for it seems like
30:58 - everybody's only hiring senior devs or
31:00 - they're saying entry level but they're
31:02 - putting three years experience into the
31:04 - into the job description so
31:06 - for someone who's looking for that first
31:07 - break for someone who is looking to
31:09 - stand out in a large sea of applicants
31:11 - for a very limited number of entry level
31:13 - roles
31:14 - what advice do you have that can help
31:16 - somebody you know
31:19 - get that first chance
31:21 - i think the biggest thing is um
31:25 - people are afraid to put their work on
31:27 - get
31:29 - to have it somewhere online because
31:31 - they're like well i don't really know
31:33 - what i'm doing
31:34 - i think so i don't want to
31:38 - you know like have have evidence online
31:41 - that i did something wrong
31:43 - but like if you look at jason's old code
31:46 - he did tons of things wrong absolutely
31:47 - and jason's brilliant so
31:50 - well
31:50 - it's like you know
31:53 - case study right there
31:55 - um
31:56 - but
31:57 - i think uh
31:59 - it's especially for people who are i
32:01 - work with a lot of women in tech um
32:03 - organizations and just like
32:06 - actual women who are doing development
32:08 - and especially
32:10 - when i was i started at the branch of
32:12 - women who code in cincinnati
32:14 - and the biggest thing i got was a lot of
32:16 - people re-entering the field
32:18 - and
32:20 - it's
32:21 - it's daunting to go in
32:23 - and talk to people
32:26 - who are also looking at applicants that
32:27 - are coming straight out of cs courses
32:29 - and they're young and they've you know
32:31 - we've been working with computers since
32:33 - they were three months old
32:35 - and
32:36 - you know it's like well i've been out of
32:39 - the industry you know do i know what i'm
32:41 - doing and one of your kindest audiences
32:44 - are the people who aren't paying you
32:46 - so
32:48 - especially right now when brick and
32:49 - mortars are really hurting and there's
32:51 - an opportunity for a lot of companies to
32:54 - go online
32:56 - but they can't afford it they need that
32:59 - help
33:01 - look into those projects even if it's
33:02 - like working with one person from your
33:04 - community and saying okay
33:06 - i'm gonna have to take the knowledge
33:08 - that i've learned through boot camps
33:09 - through doing things on my own
33:12 - and
33:12 - uh put that into an actual product
33:15 - because one you're going to learn so
33:18 - much from that
33:19 - not only just
33:21 - how hard customers are work are to work
33:24 - with
33:25 - but
33:26 - also like um you know
33:28 - how do you want to set up your
33:29 - infrastructure you know how are you
33:31 - going to have it so that people can use
33:32 - it on mobile like there are so many
33:35 - things that you're going to learn from
33:36 - just doing one actual small project like
33:38 - i do a side project with uh
33:41 - the
33:41 - uh i
33:43 - cannot get this acronym right um
33:45 - but it's basically the asian american
33:47 - association of cincinnati and so we've
33:50 - put a site together um actually using
33:53 - like gatsby and netlify
33:55 - and strappy
33:57 - to uh basically get all of these
34:00 - different asian business owners um onto
34:02 - one site it's uh asianati
34:05 - uh dot com and
34:07 - that way
34:09 - uh it's hard for restaurants right now
34:11 - to just like you're not gonna walk by a
34:12 - restaurant and be like oh i'm gonna go
34:13 - in there and eat because we're all
34:15 - inside in front of our team our tv is
34:17 - watching queen's gambit and so like
34:20 - this gives them a way to be in front of
34:22 - an audience
34:23 - um all in one central location but i'm
34:26 - doing it for free uh but i'm learning so
34:29 - much uh
34:30 - and and then
34:32 - you have an actual physical working
34:34 - thing that you can show employers so if
34:37 - you know you're more of an introvert or
34:39 - like like me you hate saying anything
34:42 - uh good about yourself to anybody but
34:44 - yourself
34:46 - then it's nice because you can just let
34:48 - your work speak for you
34:50 - and uh
34:51 - i i find that i find it really rewarding
34:54 - because you also if you can find a
34:56 - non-profit like that you get to work
34:57 - with a team
34:59 - but also um if you're doing it by
35:01 - yourself just to help out a company uh
35:04 - one it's great you help out somebody in
35:05 - your neighborhood or a small business
35:08 - and two you can make all the decisions
35:10 - yourself which is also really fun yeah
35:13 - well and the other thing that that does
35:15 - when you work with non-profits or groups
35:17 - like that is you you start building a
35:19 - network um because i know like for me i
35:22 - i got my first job in montana and in
35:25 - montana there are
35:27 - no
35:27 - jobs like it's not not well there are
35:30 - now i guess but at the time there just
35:32 - wasn't a lot of technology companies
35:34 - there and i hadn't been introduced to
35:37 - the idea of remote work so i was like
35:38 - okay well i gotta find a job in missoula
35:40 - montana that's my option
35:42 - and
35:43 - the only way that i was able to do that
35:45 - was by hanging out at a developer's
35:47 - meetup and finding people who were
35:49 - working at different companies and one
35:51 - of them got a lead on a client but they
35:53 - didn't have time so they passed it to me
35:55 - and that was my first paying client so
35:57 - those types of jobs are
35:59 - are
36:00 - really like that now that's on my resume
36:03 - where it was on my resume at the time
36:04 - you know it was like now i've got a real
36:06 - paying client look i'm a professional
36:08 - and not i'm not looking for my first
36:10 - break i'm looking for my second job and
36:12 - it changed the whole narrative it
36:14 - changed the discussion all the way from
36:16 - like hey please give me my first break
36:18 - to hey i've been doing this
36:19 - professionally i'm looking for something
36:21 - new and it immediately changed the way
36:23 - that things worked and that was all due
36:25 - to a network
36:26 - um so i think like getting involved in
36:28 - those projects getting finding ways
36:30 - where you can work with other people in
36:32 - the industry
36:33 - just long enough to be on a first name
36:35 - basis with them you know like have have
36:38 - like that idea of friends in high places
36:40 - it's not it's not what you know it's who
36:42 - you know all those things are cliches
36:44 - for a reason
36:46 - they it's they're cliches because they
36:48 - work um and so you know in now that
36:51 - everything's remote right like
36:53 - you know i how how do you feel that's
36:55 - changed for you how is your your social
36:57 - network changed in the the age of like
37:00 - remote everything
37:03 - was funny because i also got my first
37:06 - tech job out of school
37:08 - through a meetup um and that was like
37:10 - the big the big thing to me was
37:13 - i just kept finding things that i liked
37:15 - to do and so uh this company
37:18 - was uh they had a meetup and i was i was
37:21 - like kind of trying to choose between if
37:23 - i wanted to do um
37:25 - if i wanted to work more with like ruby
37:27 - ruby on rails and stuff or go into the
37:30 - node uh side of things
37:32 - and so there was a tesl meetup
37:36 - so
37:37 - tessel is an open source uh
37:39 - microcontroller
37:40 - library
37:42 - and uh it's all run on node and
37:45 - i was i love i love just like tinking or
37:48 - tinkering around with electronics still
37:50 - like soldering is one of my favorite
37:51 - pastime because of the fumes
37:53 - and so
37:55 - we
37:56 - we went into this meetup and i didn't
37:58 - know anybody there and so i just uh
38:02 - kind of talked to people
38:04 - and
38:05 - one person i just like hit it off with
38:07 - he had a 40 in a brown bag and i was
38:09 - like is that king cobra and he was like
38:11 - how did you know that and i was like
38:13 - no
38:14 - um
38:15 - and but then he was like talking he was
38:16 - like oh here's my card and i was like oh
38:19 - pragmatic or he's like a software
38:20 - craftsman and i was like oh like
38:22 - pragmatic programmer um which is a
38:24 - really great book and uh
38:27 - then he was like are you looking for a
38:29 - job and i was like oh yeah i am and
38:33 - he i ended up working for this uh
38:35 - platform as a service company and i
38:37 - loved everybody there and i was like
38:39 - you can't do that now like it's hard to
38:42 - get
38:43 - you know you can't go in person and just
38:44 - chat about whatever is going on but
38:46 - that's kind of really great for
38:48 - introverts because now there are
38:50 - different ways to communicate
38:52 - um and
38:53 - virtual tech conferences a lot of them
38:55 - are free right now like jamsatconf was
38:57 - all free
38:58 - and they're different like networking
39:00 - things that you can do inside there
39:02 - but also
39:04 - people are more inclined to be online
39:06 - and in front of their computers
39:08 - so one of the biggest things that i
39:10 - always push people to do who are coming
39:12 - back into the industry
39:15 - is to
39:16 - email
39:18 - any contact in a department that they
39:20 - were interested in
39:22 - uh in the company like just shoot out a
39:24 - cold email
39:26 - just try
39:27 - uh because
39:30 - job descriptions are
39:32 - and job listings are horrible like
39:35 - netlifies
39:36 - i highly recommend checking those out if
39:38 - like you want to see what
39:40 - it should look like obviously i'm super
39:42 - biased but
39:44 - it's like
39:45 - i i remember when i first started
39:47 - looking for jobs it would be like oh you
39:49 - should know um
39:51 - you should know
39:53 - every single backend language would be
39:54 - listed and i'm just like
39:57 - why why and it's because whoever was in
39:59 - that department to make the job
40:00 - description was like oh
40:02 - uh
40:03 - software languages okay i'll list those
40:06 - okay what else like
40:08 - and so there's so much there like that
40:10 - doesn't make sense
40:12 - so i think especially like in these
40:13 - times where nobody's really meeting up
40:16 - and talking
40:17 - you have uh there could be a slight
40:20 - advantage to being able to reach out to
40:22 - people
40:23 - and
40:24 - it's like it makes sense even to the
40:26 - people you're reaching out to like oh
40:27 - yeah i can't see this person
40:29 - in person
40:31 - so communicating online you can ask
40:33 - questions and then you don't have that
40:35 - pressure of like one-on-one being like
40:37 - oh what is job
40:39 - you know you can re-read and definitely
40:42 - proofread everything that you send out
40:44 - um
40:46 - and that's a really nice thing because
40:48 - it lets you think
40:50 - like really think about things uh
40:52 - through
40:53 - before words out your mouth are bad
40:59 - [Laughter]
41:02 - i i mean i like i'm laughing but that is
41:04 - excellent advice like i really do think
41:05 - that you know having more spaces being
41:08 - created where people can be slow and be
41:11 - considered and not necessarily have to
41:13 - immediately rapid fire think on your
41:15 - feet to respond because
41:17 - that is a whole different skill set that
41:18 - you do have to practice and and
41:20 - something that
41:21 - not all of us are ever going to be
41:22 - comfortable with um
41:24 - but so i have a couple questions from
41:26 - the chat one um
41:29 - have you worked with software testing
41:31 - professionally
41:36 - i'm not sure if that question is is
41:38 - directly at like
41:39 - were you a test engineer or like have
41:43 - you written tests as an engineer i think
41:45 - the answer will
41:46 - be the way that answer goes is slightly
41:49 - different based on context but i'll let
41:50 - you take it whichever way you want
41:55 - yes
41:57 - to all of those but because
42:03 - [Laughter]
42:11 - yes
42:15 - so
42:17 - i um
42:18 - i i because like the platform is a
42:20 - service that i worked for uh we were
42:23 - pretty small
42:24 - i was like the
42:27 - uh besides the manager like the third
42:29 - engineer hired on
42:30 - and so
42:33 - we were touching everything so
42:35 - definitely wrote a lot of tests
42:37 - and i actually like test writing
42:40 - i it's like i tend to make uh like once
42:43 - i switched over to more uh developer
42:47 - um
42:49 - what's the one that's not developer
42:50 - experience
42:53 - [Music]
42:54 - i don't know
42:55 - and i had to make a lot of demos
42:57 - um
42:58 - devrel is that what you're thinking
43:00 - yeah thank you yes
43:02 - um so when i switched over to that i had
43:04 - to make a lot of demos fast and so
43:06 - at first in the beginning i would write
43:08 - a lot more tests because i enjoyed it um
43:11 - but then
43:13 - that fell to the wayside when it was
43:14 - like oh my talks tomorrow and i need a
43:17 - demo not that i ever do that
43:19 - um
43:21 - but
43:22 - then actual testing uh we had to do a
43:24 - lot of that for our product uh at the
43:27 - platform as a service so
43:30 - yes
43:31 - yes
43:32 - um another question that i think is uh
43:35 - is very relevant is we were talking a
43:38 - little bit earlier about just building
43:40 - projects putting those out in public and
43:42 - vivek is asking will the pet projects
43:44 - help in cracking an interview for a
43:46 - developer role
43:48 - 100
43:50 - because
43:51 - that's
43:53 - again i really liked the company that i
43:56 - was working at the
43:57 - hiring manager like the engineering
43:59 - managers are really good about having
44:01 - the interview be about
44:03 - uh like
44:06 - what you know based on talking to you
44:09 - so i did no whiteboarding in that first
44:12 - interview um which is good because any
44:14 - time i go in front of a whiteboard i
44:16 - immediately draw funny dinosaurs but um
44:19 - they were like
44:20 - what is something you learned
44:23 - um on a project that you were doing
44:26 - and you know tell me the code behind it
44:29 - uh
44:30 - and that doesn't it you know everybody's
44:32 - different but that didn't feel very
44:34 - daunting to me because it was like oh my
44:36 - gosh yeah when i had to do this thing
44:39 - with this array
44:40 - and you know this wasn't the right way
44:43 - to sort through it so i had to go
44:45 - through this way and i thought that
44:46 - would work but then this thing was wrong
44:48 - and so you're basically like
44:51 - venting about a project that you're
44:54 - working on but
44:56 - in
44:57 - in that you're able to show that like
45:01 - you had you could talk through the code
45:04 - that you wrote
45:05 - and you understood
45:07 - what things were right what things were
45:09 - wrong
45:10 - and you've actually coded before
45:13 - yeah like
45:15 - which sounds ridiculous
45:17 - but
45:18 - um
45:19 - it's it's a way to know too how
45:22 - frustrated people get on what problems
45:25 - and how much excitement they find in
45:27 - coding
45:28 - so um and you know what you they try to
45:31 - stay if they if they're
45:34 - if you're i've had this before
45:36 - where you're hiring somebody who's
45:38 - supposed to mostly be working on back
45:39 - end work and all they want to talk about
45:41 - through the whole interview is the
45:44 - front-end stuff or you know stuff that
45:46 - is not
45:47 - right connected to what you're hiring
45:49 - them for and
45:52 - not that that's always a downfall but it
45:54 - says like you're not really as excited
45:56 - about
45:57 - the aspect that we're hiring for
46:00 - so but that i think is such a good point
46:02 - because like if if we're
46:04 - writing a job description for a very
46:05 - specific role and you are a great
46:07 - developer who's not interested in that
46:09 - specific role
46:11 - it's not it's going to work out poorly
46:13 - for both of us because you're you're not
46:14 - going to be super passionate about the
46:16 - work we are asking you to do and you'll
46:18 - instead be trying to do work that is you
46:20 - know
46:21 - not what we were hiring for so it's
46:23 - better
46:24 - like actually that you reminded me of
46:26 - the way we were interviewing on my team
46:28 - at ibm
46:29 - where one of the things that we would do
46:30 - is we did a take home
46:34 - work project and we just it was like
46:36 - okay you've got two hours
46:38 - build a website and the things that we
46:40 - wanted you to do for the website were
46:42 - like you could build a front end you
46:44 - could build the the kind of like data
46:46 - business layer of like how you load
46:48 - stuff in or you could build it back in
46:49 - to store that data and then we would
46:51 - look at what people focused on because
46:52 - two hours is not enough time to do the
46:54 - whole thing so we said you know do do
46:56 - whatever you would do and then at two
46:58 - hours just cut off and then we'll talk
46:59 - about you know what you would do next
47:00 - and all that and if somebody spent the
47:02 - whole time on the ui we knew that that
47:04 - was where their passion was if they
47:05 - spent the whole time setting up a back
47:07 - end we knew that was where their passion
47:08 - was um and you could hear in the way
47:10 - they talked about it because you would
47:12 - see like well
47:13 - in some i'd have to figure out how to
47:15 - build the data stuff and you can tell
47:17 - like that's not the thing they're
47:18 - comfortable with it's not the thing
47:19 - they're interested in but they would
47:20 - just bubble and bubble and bubble about
47:22 - how much fun it was to write this front
47:25 - end and you're like perfect that we
47:26 - needed a ui engineer this is exactly who
47:28 - we should hire
47:29 - um and so i and but you can see that in
47:31 - projects too like you said like if if
47:33 - somebody is putting out a lot of pet
47:35 - projects then you get like a really good
47:38 - insight into what they're excited about
47:40 - what their
47:42 - what they're building and what they're
47:43 - publishing
47:44 - that's a window you know you're you're
47:45 - telegraphing as a developer when you
47:47 - build something you're sending out a
47:49 - message that this is what i like to
47:50 - build and so if you've got a bunch of ui
47:53 - projects and you're applying for a ui
47:55 - role that sends a signal to me as a
47:56 - hiring manager
47:58 - oh this person's doing exactly what we
48:00 - want i'd like to see more and like if
48:02 - we're hiring for juniors we're not
48:04 - looking for people who are perfect we're
48:05 - looking for people who are excited
48:06 - because we're going to teach you the
48:08 - skills but we can't teach you to be
48:09 - excited about it
48:10 - um
48:13 - yeah sorry you were going to say
48:14 - something i also i oh no i was going to
48:16 - say there's a lot of resiliency to be
48:19 - showcased in doing
48:22 - side projects or pet projects
48:24 - and don't let don't let the lack of an
48:27 - idea
48:28 - stumble you
48:29 - make you stumble
48:31 - because
48:32 - um
48:34 - one thing that we were talking about i
48:35 - think this is also unremotely
48:36 - interesting um
48:38 - and i think you actually brought up this
48:40 - point of
48:42 - almost like every profession we're
48:45 - copying each other and we're totally
48:47 - totally do that in tech all the time
48:49 - um
48:50 - and that's one of the best ways to learn
48:53 - like when you're playing a musical
48:54 - instrument you're just playing the same
48:56 - thing that someone's played over and
48:58 - over and over
48:59 - and so you know if you want to you know
49:03 - try to make a buzzfeed you know make a
49:07 - buzzfeed it's showing
49:09 - that
49:10 - you can take a concept and put it onto
49:12 - the screen into actually working data
49:15 - and working files and so if you don't
49:17 - have an idea don't worry about it if you
49:19 - think that your idea is
49:21 - dumb
49:23 - that's fine most ideas we have are dumb
49:26 - it's just
49:27 - doing something yeah well and
49:29 - realistically speaking like when you get
49:30 - a job as an engineer it won't be your
49:33 - idea that you're building so so
49:35 - rebuilding another thing is a great
49:38 - example of like what it's like to work
49:39 - for another company you're going to get
49:40 - handed a mock-up you're going to get
49:42 - handed a business goal and told to build
49:44 - something and and sent loose to do that
49:46 - um and so that you know that's that's
49:49 - not like
49:50 - that is not cheating by any means that's
49:52 - actually closer to what you would do on
49:53 - the day-to-day than if you were to come
49:55 - up with something completely on your own
49:58 - yeah and just like so i know this idea i
50:00 - said it before but again if you'd go to
50:03 - a small business and you're like
50:05 - let me uh
50:07 - make your website for you
50:09 - it's gonna be quite a journey i'm not
50:12 - gonna like sugarcoat it like they're
50:13 - gonna be so grateful and do ins had like
50:15 - whatever you like but that's gonna be
50:16 - part of a really great learning process
50:19 - is like
50:20 - knowing because this happens on teams
50:22 - constantly where you're like here i made
50:24 - this thing that you asked for and
50:25 - they're like that's not exactly what i
50:26 - asked for change all of it
50:29 - okay cool
50:31 - so
50:33 - it's i mean i i can't i can't stress
50:35 - enough how like trying to find that in
50:38 - your community or small business
50:39 - somewhere it's like
50:40 - it'll help you in the long run
50:43 - yeah
50:44 - um okay so we have time for probably one
50:46 - more question and i think there's a
50:47 - really good one because we were just
50:48 - talking about projects um but there's a
50:50 - whole school of thought and a lot of
50:52 - emphasis especially in technical
50:54 - interviews on the idea of like
50:57 - the things that you would see in
50:58 - whiteboarding so leak code algorithmic
51:00 - uh you know being able to write your own
51:02 - bubble sort by hand and all that kind of
51:04 - stuff um
51:06 - what
51:07 - it seems the messaging that's being sent
51:09 - is that
51:10 - doing those types of programming puzzles
51:13 - is a more
51:15 - it's going to have more of an advantage
51:16 - when looking for a job versus building
51:18 - projects do you
51:19 - do you agree with that or kind of what's
51:21 - your take on that
51:27 - it's so this is such a loaded question
51:29 - because there are definitely benefits in
51:32 - someone being able to
51:35 - make those mental maps
51:37 - and show it in code
51:39 - uh but i am i i lose it in interviews i
51:44 - forget
51:45 - like
51:45 - i remember i had an interview and they
51:48 - were like what other frameworks are
51:49 - there for node and that is like
51:53 - like
51:54 - koa and they're like yeah i like those
51:56 - and it's like
51:57 - oh
51:59 - there are
52:00 - other ones
52:02 - in my github i have
52:04 - every single a project made with every
52:07 - single node framework
52:08 - i because i found it interesting to try
52:11 - every single one out but in the
52:13 - interview i was like my name's tara
52:18 - [Laughter]
52:22 - so i mean that in itself is like
52:25 - you know white boarding stuff can be
52:27 - actually really fun when you're
52:29 - comfortable and you're on a team and
52:30 - like you are just part of like your work
52:33 - day like i've definitely done it a lot
52:36 - and
52:36 - in jobs that i've already chosen to hire
52:39 - me um
52:41 - but i just think that there are other
52:43 - techniques to
52:45 - to
52:47 - glean a lot more from candidates that
52:50 - you
52:51 - will probably not be
52:53 - literally whiteboarding with in their
52:56 - position whatsoever right um but there
52:58 - there are like you know they're they're
53:01 - way
53:02 - it's like trying to say that a problem
53:04 - is black and white um because it's a
53:06 - cop-out it's a cop-out to just be like
53:08 - well they've been whiteboarding these
53:09 - problems for so long we're just gonna
53:11 - keep doing it
53:12 - if you want a good candidate put as much
53:14 - effort into getting that candidate as
53:16 - you want them to put into getting your
53:17 - job right um so try harder i guess
53:22 - well and for the candidates too like i
53:24 - think you know the
53:26 - as much as this sucks to say
53:29 - the algorithm stuff the the training for
53:32 - coding interviews that is like studying
53:34 - for the sats it will help you score
53:37 - better in the technical interview it
53:39 - will likely have very little impact on
53:41 - your ability to succeed in your job so
53:44 - make sure that while you're studying for
53:46 - technical interviews you're also doing
53:49 - real world type of work and the projects
53:51 - are that real world type of work so what
53:54 - like my
53:55 - my preference if if i was gonna give
53:57 - advice is to
54:00 - spend most of your time building real
54:02 - world projects and then if you are going
54:04 - into a round of technical interviews
54:06 - cram on technical interview stuff in the
54:09 - meantime like for the couple weeks
54:11 - leading up to it like don't don't make
54:13 - don't become an expert at taking tests
54:15 - that doesn't serve you in the in the job
54:16 - market uh become an expert at doing the
54:19 - work that the the test will get you to
54:21 - um and and you know
54:24 - honestly
54:25 - there's a lot of pressure on tech
54:26 - companies to revise the way that we're
54:28 - doing technical interviews and you know
54:30 - for example netlify we've dropped
54:33 - like algorithmic whiteboarding as a
54:35 - thing that we do we we've moved to
54:37 - instead doing like
54:39 - code samples you will you will implement
54:41 - a feature you will do it you know you'll
54:43 - do something that's closer to real word
54:45 - world we're not going to
54:47 - remove your access to google and make
54:48 - you write down code on a whiteboard
54:50 - that's
54:51 - it's not realistic that's not how you
54:52 - would do your job so instead we want to
54:54 - see how you think about things what
54:56 - would you google how do you you know do
54:57 - you have the the requisite context to
55:00 - break this problem down into things that
55:02 - you can search for to find the
55:03 - information that would let you solve it
55:05 - because that to me is a sign of a good
55:06 - developer not whether or not you've
55:07 - memorized a bunch of code
55:09 - um
55:10 - yeah if if i were to go on a job
55:12 - interview right now which i'm not
55:15 - no really not um but
55:18 - i would i would definitely like
55:22 - make a place that was easy for uh
55:24 - prospective employers to find my work
55:27 - and just like one or two clicks be able
55:30 - to go and look at my code go look at
55:32 - projects i've made like make it very
55:34 - accessible for them to get to because if
55:36 - it's not part of their hiring process
55:38 - you know it you want them to see this
55:42 - work so it's stuff that you're putting
55:43 - your time into make it easy for them to
55:45 - find it and to see it and make sure you
55:46 - get it to them and then like jason said
55:49 - there was a cake walk there are a few
55:51 - there's so many different resources out
55:53 - there that can like give you a bunch of
55:55 - problem examples i know cassidy williams
55:58 - newsletter she has like interview
56:00 - questions in each newsletter right
56:02 - um and she breaks down the solution too
56:04 - so like you can you can do it with a
56:06 - group which i think is a great way to
56:07 - learn
56:09 - 100
56:10 - um and yeah and then also like uh
56:14 - well you're like washing dishes they're
56:16 - you know
56:17 - doing something in your house you can
56:19 - put on uh like all these free videos
56:21 - from conferences where they talk about
56:23 - new like newer breaking
56:25 - strategies and like most things that are
56:27 - like cutting edge to just like absorb
56:30 - the different things going around in the
56:32 - community because not only are you
56:34 - hearing the jargon but you're keeping
56:36 - abreast of all the new things going on
56:38 - so those are three things that i would
56:39 - definitely keep in mind absolutely and i
56:42 - think that is a great place to wrap up
56:44 - because we are unfortunately out of time
56:46 - i feel like i could talk about this with
56:47 - you all day so
56:49 - with that i will say tara thank you so

57:22 - yeah that's the that's probably the best
57:24 - way besides coming to visit me terrace
57:25 - park ohio
57:30 - excellent um so thank you to free code
57:32 - camp for for letting me take over the
57:35 - stream uh this has been so much fun i

57:58 - article here shortly to for everyone to
58:00 - go follow up
58:01 - if you want to do more live coding um i
58:04 - run a live coding stream every week on
58:07 - tuesdays and thursdays it's called learn
58:09 - with jason it's on twitch
58:11 - learnwithjason.dev is where the schedule
58:13 - is where past episodes are and you can

Cleaned transcript:

all right we're live hello everyone hi welcome to another episode of connecting the dots today on the show i have tara z manixek thank you so much for hanging out with us today uh so tara i'm very happy to be here i mean i and i'm just like i'm pumped because i i have joked many times that you are like the most interesting person in tech um because it seems like every time i mention anything like i'll be like oh yeah i'm working on like a part of my kitchen you're like oh yeah back when i was a plumber um and so you just you kind of have like this incredibly diverse background in terms of where you what you've done for jobs what you've done for work um so i guess to start maybe we can we can um tee it off with where you are now what's your current role i am um at this company called netlify i'm not sure if you've heard of it uh nice to meet you by the way i am on the the dx team uh mostly working with angular and then a bunch of really fun internal products like uh jam stack explorers so that's where i currently am absolutely um and so this uh to me this is like this is the perfect show for you because i feel like sorry hold on let me just take a second to congratulate myself on the brilliance of my name is jason i made this show and it's perfect let me tell you more but to so let me qualify that what i mean by this is that this show is actually um it's the result of a conversation that you and i had which was um we were talking about how the skills that we build when we work in different jobs translate so well into tech in really unexpected ways and so in the past you know you and i have both had non nontraditional like we're not you you don't have a cs degree right i do you do oh my god you get more and more interesting okay all right well maybe i should let you tell your own story then [Laughter] isn't that isn't that ridiculous though i mean it's uh it's it's funny because it's actually from the harvard extension school uh and i i got it because i met so i'm a business school dropout i tried to go to business school i failed so miserably that they were because i was like oh these business classes aren't fun i'm just going to go to my math classes and ceramics and classical guitar classes and they're like yeah you can't do that and i was like oh um so i dropped out of there and then ended up working um at harvard and so i uh got they have this tap program tuition assistance program so you can take courses for twenty dollars at their extension school as long as you can like get in and uh i just kept being like i started with there's like a physical and screen based computing class that was actually through mit uh but we were allowed to take it and i liked it so much i they used processing with java it was when processing was like kind of new ish so it was only used with java and so i was like oh i want to be better at making silly designs i should learn java and so that's how i learned java and from there they were like well you could be better at this if you learn data structures and i was like okay in order to make my really stupid silly electronics video games i am going to continue to learn data structures and it just went from there and eventually i had a cs degree jeez yeah okay uh every time we talk i learned something new um but so uh so what are some of the other jobs that you've held uh in addition to being a coder so i was actually looking back and i haven't had a break from the okay so i've started working in 1995 and the longest break i've ever had without a job was the maternity leave that i took about two years ago so and sometimes i've like overlapped jobs um and it's funny because thinking about like my first office job was when i sound so ridiculous when i was 12 years old um because you can't work until you're 14 in ohio but i or is is i don't know is that everywhere i think it's different from state to state okay so i but i had a taste of it because i had started my own wagon business obviously um and which first i was which i took pumpkin rolls around to business districts and sold them inside of the little you know where it's like a brick log building and there's like 18 businesses in there so i did that um and so you know doortodoor pumpkin roll sales as one does when they're that old uh and then i painted curbs and stuff and this was all because i wanted to buy a flute okay so i so at that point i was just like learned okay i need money to get things therefore i like sell goods um and then from there i was just like you know this isn't enough i need more money [Laughter] but then so my grandmother was like well come to barberlin foods and you can be my payroll assistant you really like math so um you can do payroll for everybody and the funniest thing is like i learned really good people skills there because my grandma is such a little schmoozer uh she used to be yeah so she like did she did a lot of office management work for a while and then when she retired she became a bartender at the vfw as grandmas do um and so she was like the thing that you have to understand is people just want you to listen to them if you listen to them and you genuinely find something to care about like of them then they'll they'll warm up to you faster and they'll give you the better benefit of the doubt um and it's funny because she's uh known as being quite a like cold sarcastic woman and she was doing that to her own advantage but when i learned that i learned it as such a like real genuine trait that i really have when i meet people i want to hear more about them and then i just like even if they're people that aren't the most likable people i always try to find at least one thing that i find uh either like very intriguing or it's something i like about them and always try to keep that in mind at the forefront uh which has helped me a lot in the tech industry i can imagine um so so that's fascinating so that was like that takes us up to what you were 13. [Laughter] so uh this is this is a fivehour episode right um but so so along the way you you so you started out you you had you know your your pumpkin roll business um you you work doing the books and then you you've like you ended up at some point doing like you were driving a forklift right so that's actually like 13 years later or is that right maybe maybe like 12 or something um so i've had a lot of uh retail experience and um through a lot of different uh companies like like looking through the list it's been like a lot of like food and retail things uh i worked at subway target texas roadhouse panera bridge chipotle pacific summer urban outfitters and bigs this is the one where i was doing the forklift because i was working in um the garden center okay so i would get all of the pallets uh back and forth of mulch and stone and everything but i think like one of the things that i learned the most from those jobs that has helped me a lot is like from the retail jobs in particular is that uh customer service and common sense go hand in hand and i think that uh there you just have to have the only emotion that you should have in customer service is empathy because if you get angry if you if you just say if you feel attacked if you get defensive that's going to take you nowhere fast and it's funny because i think like especially with working with open source software that has really helped me a ton because it's so easy for me to get defensive about my code but when somebody is saying like this isn't working for me and why did you write it this way and i have to remember how frustrated i get when i use libraries and i say why did they do it this way this does not work this api is so it's bonkers it's backwards whatever um and so when i see things coming my way i know i don't want an author of a plugin to be like i'm not gonna help you because uh you know you're a jerk or you know there's a and it's like so it's like i don't want to be a jerk and i don't want to be a jerk to you and there's been multiple times um especially in issues and stuff where people are like your product sucks this is stupid what are you doing this is awful and so i just come back and i think about it and i try it like but keep my best to like um take myself out of that situation like like i did when i was like doing target returns and they're like your stupid store said that i had to bring this back and i'm like okay i see this is really frustrating because you need this thing to work and you know i just you know i'm here oneonone with you how can we make this work and just drop all that drama part of it to see if we can get to a solution and that like writing back to people's angry issues like that i've had so many times where people come back and they go oh you know i was really upset sorry for the things that i said yeah here's my problem here's the code what can we do yeah but that's hard there's a lot of emotion in code we write and and like what you're talking about too it um it kind of reminds me of like you know they say that uh like the laws of thermodynamics like every every action has an equal and opposite reaction right what i've found though is that in human interactions that's not true human interactions tend to mirror each other which is why when somebody comes at you hard and you get defensive if you go back it will get really contentious but if somebody comes at you hard and you don't you you like just let the the anger wash over you and you just respond as measured as you can and and like nothing comes back so it's really hard for them to stay mad like it's really hard you know what i mean it's that whole idea of like it's so hard to like attack somebody who's peaceful like peaceful resistance kind of thing like so if somebody's coming at you you know and you just say i understand and i want to help uh no you don't know the person who's coming at you um oh sorry i think i had a little delay you're fine you're back okay bye am i here um so i was just gonna say that i think we talk about this or we don't talk about this enough but just like understanding that our jobs aren't our whole lives and so when people come at you angry you don't know where they're coming from and so i did americorps national civilian community court and we did katrina disaster relief so right right after all the floods we went down and we like gutted houses um and you know worked at different volunteer bases and basically like just entrenched ourselves in these areas that were just demolished and uh you had it was hard to because you would get so desensitized from living in these areas it was hard to remember what people were going through so we would have like i remember having a situation where i was uh in one of the volunteer camps and this guy came in and he was like just went off on us uh because our truck was parked in front of his driveway and we didn't even know anybody was there so we were just like huh and he was screaming and i don't do well with people screaming uh but i had at first we were all just like what how dare you like sorry that's my dog um but then you realize like oh yeah this guy doesn't have a place to live anymore he's coming home to his house being completely and you can't even get in the driveway now and so i think about that kind of mindset when you know people come at you already at a level 10 and you're just like dude all it was is that you know that part of the module needed installed like why are you yelling already and then you're just like oh yeah your boss is yelling at you to get this done immediately and their boss is yelling at them and like there's a whole trickle down and you just know that yelling is happening and you should be yelling too and i also think like in open source there's this this tendency where like in the early days of open source it's really fun because when you're a maintainer everybody who's coming to your library is they're voluntarily there they want to try something out there they're there to learn and to like be part of a community later as something gets popular like you know if you're a webpack maintainer right now most of the people in the webpack issues they're not there because they wanted to learn webpack they're there because they inherited a project and they're on a deadline and something is broken and they don't understand it and they didn't write this code to begin with and they're furious that they have to deal with this problem because they don't feel like it should be their problem and unfortunately you as the maintainer are the person standing right in front of them when they're having this realization and uh i think yeah i mean i i love i love that way of framing it though because if you think about the fact that people don't exist in a vacuum you know if you if you assume that people exist when they're outside of your your field of view they've got whole stories they've got whole lives going on and and the thing that's happening to you right now has very little to do with you if this isn't somebody you know exactly exactly and it's funny because you know like they say software is easy people are hard and i think i think that a lot that a lot that i learned from getting my cs degree is um and i i so i was really lucky my mom taught electronics at the local community college and so when i would get out of school i would go to her cl like her electronics lab and just fiddle around with breadboards and stuff so i got taught the mindset of logical thinking uh thanks to that really uh analog procedure of like this thing is feeding this thing and it can only get these instructions it can only be on or off and where is that on or off going and who is it telling us what's on and off so i was really lucky to have that kind of like logical mindset pretty early on and then that got really reinforced once i started going through uh all my cs courses and it's kind of like which i think you can learn from not even just classes but doing uh development work in general um but i definitely saw when the switch flipped you know when you're like you're making dinner after coating something out and you're like pot turn boil water boil when water boils pasta [Laughter] what's happened to my brain and it's just like i remember just thinking of like my dog's different methods and i was just like oh what's happening but that is such a that's a factor in a development job the human communication that has to go to make a functioning team and a functioning product is something that like you don't have to have 38 jobs like i have had but it definitely helps to have such a mixture of one like working or dealing with both people that you need to manage people that are on your all people that you need to manage people that are on your team and people that are managing you and i think i learned a ton from the different kinds of jobs i had and the different responsibilities i had in each of those jobs um so i i'm gonna make one quick comment which is that when you when you're talking about your your uh like writing the code for making pasta the italians in chat are very grateful that you said when water then pasta which i also uh well done um but uh another question so there was a question earlier you talked about getting your css your cs degree and when you were learning data structures and pranav asks uh how is your experience learning data structures and and like what of that do you find has been important in your in your roles or in your career i guess it's funny because it was definitely a lot of you know now i didn't it wasn't that long ago that i went to school but now they have so many hilarious resources like uh like bubble sort square dancing videos and i saw that and i'm like oh yeah that would make i had a real i had a really great teacher um and and so he did a lot of things like the whole tearing of the notebook uh to kind of show you different kinds of ways to like sort uh that class was by far one of my hardest because i had only done like intro to java before then so that like logical mindset wasn't completely ingrained in me it's funny to think how i use it now because i'm not anytime i need to do a data structure or some kind of like principle along those lines i go back to reference constantly so there's nothing in my head that i'm yeah then i'm this like oh well it's obviously this because of that um that's cassidy cassidy is the one that does that um it's cassidy williams that we're referring to obviously um but uh i do i do have that mindset though of like yeah we're we're setting um we have to have these different markers to understand what is the best process to make this faster and like we were talking about this in um on remotely interesting a podcast we do uh skype weird guy jason's on there too and we talked about rendering in this one episode and it's funny because in everything we have these markers so like we have uh like you know time to first contentful paint and like time like we're all we're marking everything so that we have a system to understand what how it's going to be better for our users and so it's more that i'm not bringing any data structures with me on a daily basis but it's more that mindset of like our there is an algorithm to figure out how to make this best for our users and that mentality has definitely stuck through and through the rest of that class though i mean i so i i don't have a cs degree but what i what i have found about things like algorithms data structures that type of study is i very rarely am looking at that information and saying that's exactly what i'm going to do to solve this problem but what i what i found is that having that around in the back of my mind when i look at a problem i at least have a list of things to like thumb through and go is that kind of like this is that kind of like this and then i can go i at least know what to google right and i think that's been probably the most beneficial part of any of that more academic learning for me has been it it gives me vocabulary that lets me google more effectively yeah yeah which is i mean it's it's hilarious to me when i try to tell people just how much googling is part of our job like and it's funny because that's another one that i've learned through so many different jobs is to ask for help not just like searching things on the web but it's like it takes a lot of humility to one admit you did something wrong and then on top of it ask for help um but it's just it's totally clutch like you nobody's perfect and uh if you are turns out you're wrong so uh but but it's definitely like through the years i've definitely had to like tell myself remind myself that it's just like okay you even about things that don't have like a specific right answer just knowing that you may think this is the best way to go about doing something but you're not working in a silo so you have to like i remember the first time our uh our the vp of development experience at netlify sarah drazner said to disagree and commit i just remember being like oh what and then it's just like oh yeah because team like company business it's like yeah it makes sense like you've got to do that in your daily life i've also been in a relationship for like too long what 12 years or something oh 14. um and i mean half at least three quarters of the relationship is disagreeing commit so you learn from everywhere in your life yeah well and actually i think that's kind of a so you mentioned one thing that i think is really hard to start because especially when you're new in your career the idea of of admitting that you don't know something that can feel like it's gonna be the giveaway that gets you like thrown out you know it's like oh they're gonna realize that i don't know what i'm doing for for you how like how was that experience and like how did what experiences did you have that helped you overcome that fear of saying like hey i don't know how to do this who who can help me i've always liked to learn um and having having the having the craving to learn has over compensated that whole pride thing um and but it was definitely something that i learned i realized that i made a better uh team member in in the develop in the dev world because i had uh i had learned a lot so much from all the other jobs that i've been on like i didn't know how to like um so i like renovated a house recently and like i didn't know the proper way to like cut and install drywall how to do plumbing how the different angles matter if you actually want your poop to go down um so so it's definitely a lot of being like there's something like i had the the overseer of of doing a lot of the construction work uh i i worked with habitat for humanity for a little while and we actually built houses on the um on the uh mall in dc okay so it was like this really cool event where they had 12 houses and we built them on the mall and then they got on trucks and moved them out to different places around like anacostia and the area that was so cool and uh the foreman on the project was so mean and you don't really expect it for like these programs that are like let's all work together um and he just expected you to know everything and so we would be putting things together and i'm like i don't know how to do this but the last thing you want to go is like go up to the bully and be like i'm dumb because he just was like what do you mean you don't know how to frame a house and i'm like i'm i don't know i also had like 16 jello shots last night so let's work together um but i feel like when when you have that experience of just like okay this is the boss right like the boss in a video game but like his defense is like being a jerk to you and then how you're gonna or like his attack is being a jerk to you and then your defense is just like taking it and knowing that he has not doesn't know anything about you he can't really change your life in any horrible way so the only thing that can happen here is that i can just let those things slide off me and learn what i need to learn and that's an extreme situation like hopefully not a lot of people are like having insults thrown at them as they're trying to hammer two by fours together but uh it made me even be better at like the first dev job i had um i kind i like i knew what i was doing but i had always worked with uh i was like switching to do more back end work and i was also unfamiliar with infrastructure and so it would look like i knew what i was doing so my managers would be like yeah that's right just keep doing what you're doing i'm like it looks like i know what i'm doing but i don't so explain this to me on this selection and this section is if i don't know what i'm doing right and i felt like that was a really good thing that i'm glad i had in my toolbox um to even say like yeah sure you think i'm doing it right but i'm not i i don't know what i'm doing um because that's hard it's hard one to just say you don't know what you're doing and especially when you're new and you're like they could they just brought me on like they could get rid of me if they wanted but it's also it's really good to remember i'm gonna take a breath talking after this point it's good to remember with both um like many things in life but development and definitely speaking like doing talks especially technical talks people don't want to see you fail like 97.63 people don't want to see you fail it's extremely awkward as an audience member it's very uh it's not it's not what managers want to see so they're rooting for you when it comes down to it so if they can find a way to help you succeed as a manager the audience can't if they can find a way to help you succeed as one of their employees that's what they want to do so if you can give them what they need to let them know what you need to succeed right like it's making everybody happier nobody yeah nobody wants to see you fail so yeah well and really like if somebody hired you it's gonna look really bad on them if the person they hired is like not equipped to do the job so it's in there like even just selfishly it's in your manager your your employer's best interest to train you so you know and if they do want to see you fail you don't want to work there yeah fair enough right um but so so we've been kind of talking like this is this is a lot of abstract stuff that i think is really really helpful but um for a lot of folks watching this stream um they're in free code camp and a lot of those folks are looking for their first role so when you are like i know that you do a decent amount of mentorship i know that you work with a lot of communities um you you've been in the industry for a while so i don't i mean i have a hard time remembering how i got my first role outside of like i did a thing and then i had a job but um but what advice do you have like the industry is flooded right now there are a lot of people looking for their first job there's also a little bit of constriction due to the pandemic companies are looking for it seems like everybody's only hiring senior devs or they're saying entry level but they're putting three years experience into the into the job description so for someone who's looking for that first break for someone who is looking to stand out in a large sea of applicants for a very limited number of entry level roles what advice do you have that can help somebody you know get that first chance i think the biggest thing is um people are afraid to put their work on get to have it somewhere online because they're like well i don't really know what i'm doing i think so i don't want to you know like have have evidence online that i did something wrong but like if you look at jason's old code he did tons of things wrong absolutely and jason's brilliant so well it's like you know case study right there um but i think uh it's especially for people who are i work with a lot of women in tech um organizations and just like actual women who are doing development and especially when i was i started at the branch of women who code in cincinnati and the biggest thing i got was a lot of people reentering the field and it's it's daunting to go in and talk to people who are also looking at applicants that are coming straight out of cs courses and they're young and they've you know we've been working with computers since they were three months old and you know it's like well i've been out of the industry you know do i know what i'm doing and one of your kindest audiences are the people who aren't paying you so especially right now when brick and mortars are really hurting and there's an opportunity for a lot of companies to go online but they can't afford it they need that help look into those projects even if it's like working with one person from your community and saying okay i'm gonna have to take the knowledge that i've learned through boot camps through doing things on my own and uh put that into an actual product because one you're going to learn so much from that not only just how hard customers are work are to work with but also like um you know how do you want to set up your infrastructure you know how are you going to have it so that people can use it on mobile like there are so many things that you're going to learn from just doing one actual small project like i do a side project with uh the uh i cannot get this acronym right um but it's basically the asian american association of cincinnati and so we've put a site together um actually using like gatsby and netlify and strappy to uh basically get all of these different asian business owners um onto one site it's uh asianati uh dot com and that way uh it's hard for restaurants right now to just like you're not gonna walk by a restaurant and be like oh i'm gonna go in there and eat because we're all inside in front of our team our tv is watching queen's gambit and so like this gives them a way to be in front of an audience um all in one central location but i'm doing it for free uh but i'm learning so much uh and and then you have an actual physical working thing that you can show employers so if you know you're more of an introvert or like like me you hate saying anything uh good about yourself to anybody but yourself then it's nice because you can just let your work speak for you and uh i i find that i find it really rewarding because you also if you can find a nonprofit like that you get to work with a team but also um if you're doing it by yourself just to help out a company uh one it's great you help out somebody in your neighborhood or a small business and two you can make all the decisions yourself which is also really fun yeah well and the other thing that that does when you work with nonprofits or groups like that is you you start building a network um because i know like for me i i got my first job in montana and in montana there are no jobs like it's not not well there are now i guess but at the time there just wasn't a lot of technology companies there and i hadn't been introduced to the idea of remote work so i was like okay well i gotta find a job in missoula montana that's my option and the only way that i was able to do that was by hanging out at a developer's meetup and finding people who were working at different companies and one of them got a lead on a client but they didn't have time so they passed it to me and that was my first paying client so those types of jobs are are really like that now that's on my resume where it was on my resume at the time you know it was like now i've got a real paying client look i'm a professional and not i'm not looking for my first break i'm looking for my second job and it changed the whole narrative it changed the discussion all the way from like hey please give me my first break to hey i've been doing this professionally i'm looking for something new and it immediately changed the way that things worked and that was all due to a network um so i think like getting involved in those projects getting finding ways where you can work with other people in the industry just long enough to be on a first name basis with them you know like have have like that idea of friends in high places it's not it's not what you know it's who you know all those things are cliches for a reason they it's they're cliches because they work um and so you know in now that everything's remote right like you know i how how do you feel that's changed for you how is your your social network changed in the the age of like remote everything was funny because i also got my first tech job out of school through a meetup um and that was like the big the big thing to me was i just kept finding things that i liked to do and so uh this company was uh they had a meetup and i was i was like kind of trying to choose between if i wanted to do um if i wanted to work more with like ruby ruby on rails and stuff or go into the node uh side of things and so there was a tesl meetup so tessel is an open source uh microcontroller library and uh it's all run on node and i was i love i love just like tinking or tinkering around with electronics still like soldering is one of my favorite pastime because of the fumes and so we we went into this meetup and i didn't know anybody there and so i just uh kind of talked to people and one person i just like hit it off with he had a 40 in a brown bag and i was like is that king cobra and he was like how did you know that and i was like no um and but then he was like talking he was like oh here's my card and i was like oh pragmatic or he's like a software craftsman and i was like oh like pragmatic programmer um which is a really great book and uh then he was like are you looking for a job and i was like oh yeah i am and he i ended up working for this uh platform as a service company and i loved everybody there and i was like you can't do that now like it's hard to get you know you can't go in person and just chat about whatever is going on but that's kind of really great for introverts because now there are different ways to communicate um and virtual tech conferences a lot of them are free right now like jamsatconf was all free and they're different like networking things that you can do inside there but also people are more inclined to be online and in front of their computers so one of the biggest things that i always push people to do who are coming back into the industry is to email any contact in a department that they were interested in uh in the company like just shoot out a cold email just try uh because job descriptions are and job listings are horrible like netlifies i highly recommend checking those out if like you want to see what it should look like obviously i'm super biased but it's like i i remember when i first started looking for jobs it would be like oh you should know um you should know every single backend language would be listed and i'm just like why why and it's because whoever was in that department to make the job description was like oh uh software languages okay i'll list those okay what else like and so there's so much there like that doesn't make sense so i think especially like in these times where nobody's really meeting up and talking you have uh there could be a slight advantage to being able to reach out to people and it's like it makes sense even to the people you're reaching out to like oh yeah i can't see this person in person so communicating online you can ask questions and then you don't have that pressure of like oneonone being like oh what is job you know you can reread and definitely proofread everything that you send out um and that's a really nice thing because it lets you think like really think about things uh through before words out your mouth are bad [Laughter] i i mean i like i'm laughing but that is excellent advice like i really do think that you know having more spaces being created where people can be slow and be considered and not necessarily have to immediately rapid fire think on your feet to respond because that is a whole different skill set that you do have to practice and and something that not all of us are ever going to be comfortable with um but so i have a couple questions from the chat one um have you worked with software testing professionally i'm not sure if that question is is directly at like were you a test engineer or like have you written tests as an engineer i think the answer will be the way that answer goes is slightly different based on context but i'll let you take it whichever way you want yes to all of those but because [Laughter] yes so i um i i because like the platform is a service that i worked for uh we were pretty small i was like the uh besides the manager like the third engineer hired on and so we were touching everything so definitely wrote a lot of tests and i actually like test writing i it's like i tend to make uh like once i switched over to more uh developer um what's the one that's not developer experience i don't know and i had to make a lot of demos um devrel is that what you're thinking yeah thank you yes um so when i switched over to that i had to make a lot of demos fast and so at first in the beginning i would write a lot more tests because i enjoyed it um but then that fell to the wayside when it was like oh my talks tomorrow and i need a demo not that i ever do that um but then actual testing uh we had to do a lot of that for our product uh at the platform as a service so yes yes um another question that i think is uh is very relevant is we were talking a little bit earlier about just building projects putting those out in public and vivek is asking will the pet projects help in cracking an interview for a developer role 100 because that's again i really liked the company that i was working at the hiring manager like the engineering managers are really good about having the interview be about uh like what you know based on talking to you so i did no whiteboarding in that first interview um which is good because any time i go in front of a whiteboard i immediately draw funny dinosaurs but um they were like what is something you learned um on a project that you were doing and you know tell me the code behind it uh and that doesn't it you know everybody's different but that didn't feel very daunting to me because it was like oh my gosh yeah when i had to do this thing with this array and you know this wasn't the right way to sort through it so i had to go through this way and i thought that would work but then this thing was wrong and so you're basically like venting about a project that you're working on but in in that you're able to show that like you had you could talk through the code that you wrote and you understood what things were right what things were wrong and you've actually coded before yeah like which sounds ridiculous but um it's it's a way to know too how frustrated people get on what problems and how much excitement they find in coding so um and you know what you they try to stay if they if they're if you're i've had this before where you're hiring somebody who's supposed to mostly be working on back end work and all they want to talk about through the whole interview is the frontend stuff or you know stuff that is not right connected to what you're hiring them for and not that that's always a downfall but it says like you're not really as excited about the aspect that we're hiring for so but that i think is such a good point because like if if we're writing a job description for a very specific role and you are a great developer who's not interested in that specific role it's not it's going to work out poorly for both of us because you're you're not going to be super passionate about the work we are asking you to do and you'll instead be trying to do work that is you know not what we were hiring for so it's better like actually that you reminded me of the way we were interviewing on my team at ibm where one of the things that we would do is we did a take home work project and we just it was like okay you've got two hours build a website and the things that we wanted you to do for the website were like you could build a front end you could build the the kind of like data business layer of like how you load stuff in or you could build it back in to store that data and then we would look at what people focused on because two hours is not enough time to do the whole thing so we said you know do do whatever you would do and then at two hours just cut off and then we'll talk about you know what you would do next and all that and if somebody spent the whole time on the ui we knew that that was where their passion was if they spent the whole time setting up a back end we knew that was where their passion was um and you could hear in the way they talked about it because you would see like well in some i'd have to figure out how to build the data stuff and you can tell like that's not the thing they're comfortable with it's not the thing they're interested in but they would just bubble and bubble and bubble about how much fun it was to write this front end and you're like perfect that we needed a ui engineer this is exactly who we should hire um and so i and but you can see that in projects too like you said like if if somebody is putting out a lot of pet projects then you get like a really good insight into what they're excited about what their what they're building and what they're publishing that's a window you know you're you're telegraphing as a developer when you build something you're sending out a message that this is what i like to build and so if you've got a bunch of ui projects and you're applying for a ui role that sends a signal to me as a hiring manager oh this person's doing exactly what we want i'd like to see more and like if we're hiring for juniors we're not looking for people who are perfect we're looking for people who are excited because we're going to teach you the skills but we can't teach you to be excited about it um yeah sorry you were going to say something i also i oh no i was going to say there's a lot of resiliency to be showcased in doing side projects or pet projects and don't let don't let the lack of an idea stumble you make you stumble because um one thing that we were talking about i think this is also unremotely interesting um and i think you actually brought up this point of almost like every profession we're copying each other and we're totally totally do that in tech all the time um and that's one of the best ways to learn like when you're playing a musical instrument you're just playing the same thing that someone's played over and over and over and so you know if you want to you know try to make a buzzfeed you know make a buzzfeed it's showing that you can take a concept and put it onto the screen into actually working data and working files and so if you don't have an idea don't worry about it if you think that your idea is dumb that's fine most ideas we have are dumb it's just doing something yeah well and realistically speaking like when you get a job as an engineer it won't be your idea that you're building so so rebuilding another thing is a great example of like what it's like to work for another company you're going to get handed a mockup you're going to get handed a business goal and told to build something and and sent loose to do that um and so that you know that's that's not like that is not cheating by any means that's actually closer to what you would do on the daytoday than if you were to come up with something completely on your own yeah and just like so i know this idea i said it before but again if you'd go to a small business and you're like let me uh make your website for you it's gonna be quite a journey i'm not gonna like sugarcoat it like they're gonna be so grateful and do ins had like whatever you like but that's gonna be part of a really great learning process is like knowing because this happens on teams constantly where you're like here i made this thing that you asked for and they're like that's not exactly what i asked for change all of it okay cool so it's i mean i i can't i can't stress enough how like trying to find that in your community or small business somewhere it's like it'll help you in the long run yeah um okay so we have time for probably one more question and i think there's a really good one because we were just talking about projects um but there's a whole school of thought and a lot of emphasis especially in technical interviews on the idea of like the things that you would see in whiteboarding so leak code algorithmic uh you know being able to write your own bubble sort by hand and all that kind of stuff um what it seems the messaging that's being sent is that doing those types of programming puzzles is a more it's going to have more of an advantage when looking for a job versus building projects do you do you agree with that or kind of what's your take on that it's so this is such a loaded question because there are definitely benefits in someone being able to make those mental maps and show it in code uh but i am i i lose it in interviews i forget like i remember i had an interview and they were like what other frameworks are there for node and that is like like koa and they're like yeah i like those and it's like oh there are other ones in my github i have every single a project made with every single node framework i because i found it interesting to try every single one out but in the interview i was like my name's tara [Laughter] so i mean that in itself is like you know white boarding stuff can be actually really fun when you're comfortable and you're on a team and like you are just part of like your work day like i've definitely done it a lot and in jobs that i've already chosen to hire me um but i just think that there are other techniques to to glean a lot more from candidates that you will probably not be literally whiteboarding with in their position whatsoever right um but there there are like you know they're they're way it's like trying to say that a problem is black and white um because it's a copout it's a copout to just be like well they've been whiteboarding these problems for so long we're just gonna keep doing it if you want a good candidate put as much effort into getting that candidate as you want them to put into getting your job right um so try harder i guess well and for the candidates too like i think you know the as much as this sucks to say the algorithm stuff the the training for coding interviews that is like studying for the sats it will help you score better in the technical interview it will likely have very little impact on your ability to succeed in your job so make sure that while you're studying for technical interviews you're also doing real world type of work and the projects are that real world type of work so what like my my preference if if i was gonna give advice is to spend most of your time building real world projects and then if you are going into a round of technical interviews cram on technical interview stuff in the meantime like for the couple weeks leading up to it like don't don't make don't become an expert at taking tests that doesn't serve you in the in the job market uh become an expert at doing the work that the the test will get you to um and and you know honestly there's a lot of pressure on tech companies to revise the way that we're doing technical interviews and you know for example netlify we've dropped like algorithmic whiteboarding as a thing that we do we we've moved to instead doing like code samples you will you will implement a feature you will do it you know you'll do something that's closer to real word world we're not going to remove your access to google and make you write down code on a whiteboard that's it's not realistic that's not how you would do your job so instead we want to see how you think about things what would you google how do you you know do you have the the requisite context to break this problem down into things that you can search for to find the information that would let you solve it because that to me is a sign of a good developer not whether or not you've memorized a bunch of code um yeah if if i were to go on a job interview right now which i'm not no really not um but i would i would definitely like make a place that was easy for uh prospective employers to find my work and just like one or two clicks be able to go and look at my code go look at projects i've made like make it very accessible for them to get to because if it's not part of their hiring process you know it you want them to see this work so it's stuff that you're putting your time into make it easy for them to find it and to see it and make sure you get it to them and then like jason said there was a cake walk there are a few there's so many different resources out there that can like give you a bunch of problem examples i know cassidy williams newsletter she has like interview questions in each newsletter right um and she breaks down the solution too so like you can you can do it with a group which i think is a great way to learn 100 um and yeah and then also like uh well you're like washing dishes they're you know doing something in your house you can put on uh like all these free videos from conferences where they talk about new like newer breaking strategies and like most things that are like cutting edge to just like absorb the different things going around in the community because not only are you hearing the jargon but you're keeping abreast of all the new things going on so those are three things that i would definitely keep in mind absolutely and i think that is a great place to wrap up because we are unfortunately out of time i feel like i could talk about this with you all day so with that i will say tara thank you so so much for for hanging out with us today um where should people go if they want to follow up with you um i think quincy dropped your twitter maybe i live yeah i live in winnick woods no yeah twitter my dms are open i'm so bad at social media but uh i will i'll get back eventually but my dns are open um and then yeah and then um yeah that's the that's probably the best way besides coming to visit me terrace park ohio excellent um so thank you to free code camp for for letting me take over the stream uh this has been so much fun i really enjoy everybody thank you to everybody in the chat who asked great questions um keep in mind we do these on fridays so we'll be back again next friday uh with i believe april spite is going to be on next week which i'm super excited about uh so mark your calendars make sure that you go and uh and you know get the i think quincy will post the article here shortly to for everyone to go follow up if you want to do more live coding um i run a live coding stream every week on tuesdays and thursdays it's called learn with jason it's on twitch learnwithjason.dev is where the schedule is where past episodes are and you can come learn something with me in 90 minutes and on that note i think we're going to call this one in the can tara thank you again chat thank you again we'll see
