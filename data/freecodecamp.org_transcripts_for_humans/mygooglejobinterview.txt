00:00 - hey everybody it's me Jesse and I just
00:04 - want to tell you a little bit about my
00:06 - Google interview experience so my last
00:10 - video I talked about the overall job
00:15 - hunting experience and I mentioned the
00:18 - Google interview a little bit but
00:20 - several of you asked for more details so
00:23 - here they are when I first put out my
00:28 - message on Twitter that I was looking
00:30 - for for work I got a response from a
00:35 - Google recruiter and which was amazing
00:38 - right
00:39 - I had previously I had applied to
00:42 - positions at Google for their Pittsburgh
00:45 - office and even even with a reference I
00:49 - still couldn't even get an interview so
00:51 - I was pretty amazed at that that just I
00:55 - guess it kind of shows like the power of
00:57 - having a good Twitter network so I got
01:02 - an email from a recruiter or it might
01:06 - have been a DM on Twitter actually I
01:08 - don't remember for sure but either way
01:10 - message back and forth a little bit set
01:12 - up a phone call so that first phone call
01:15 - was just with the recruiter and I and we
01:23 - just talked like about what what I do
01:26 - what my my past experience was and what
01:30 - I'm interested in now and then we talked
01:34 - a little bit about the role at Google
01:37 - and whether or not I'd be interested in
01:39 - it so you know really basic no no
01:43 - technical questions or anything like
01:45 - that and then after that the next step
01:48 - was to set me up with a technical
01:51 - interview over the phone so the way we
01:56 - did it was I had a Google Doc so there
02:00 - was a link to a Google Doc a shared
02:02 - Google Doc I went there and then I was
02:05 - asked a coding question and I had to
02:08 - type out my answer in the Google Doc so
02:11 - to my surprise
02:13 - the question was actually way more
02:16 - front-end oriented oriented and didn't
02:20 - have much to do with data structures or
02:22 - algorithms I had heard you know from
02:26 - from other people from from sources
02:28 - online and in books that you needed to
02:31 - know your data structures and algorithms
02:32 - to work at Google but I I didn't have
02:37 - any this was basically just a front-end
02:39 - based question so it may disappoint some
02:43 - of you to know that I'm not gonna give
02:44 - you the exact questions I don't think
02:46 - that would be that helpful actually
02:48 - because the odds of getting the same
02:50 - question are very slim each interviewer
02:52 - has freedom to ask you know whatever
02:55 - questions they want to ask so it's it
03:00 - probably wouldn't be that that helpful
03:02 - anyway but it was more front-end
03:06 - oriented I got to use JavaScript and I I
03:10 - thought that I did okay on it it seemed
03:15 - easier than I expected and I didn't I
03:20 - wasn't really expecting to move on to
03:22 - the next round although I did better
03:24 - than I thought it just I wasn't
03:25 - expecting it right to prepare I had
03:29 - looked at some like online training so
03:33 - there are several websites out there
03:35 - that will let you do algorithm problems
03:39 - and just test yourself on them so
03:43 - there's a website called pram PRA MP and
03:47 - you can actually interview with other
03:50 - people so the way it works is you
03:52 - schedule time the first I think half
03:55 - hour one person interviews the other one
03:58 - and then you switch roles and then you
04:01 - go for another I believe it's a half an
04:03 - hour so I did a little bit of that and
04:05 - that was kind of nice just to practice
04:07 - like talking through things I mean
04:09 - through the live coding that I do for
04:11 - free code camp I was already used to
04:12 - talking through coding so that wasn't
04:14 - really a big deal for me but it was it
04:16 - was good to like be under pressure with
04:18 - a question that you don't know
04:21 - beforehand
04:22 - so on the front end related stuff I did
04:25 - great on any time I try to do a date
04:27 - algorithm problem I was not great with
04:29 - that but luckily the first interview all
04:34 - front end ended up getting a call back
04:37 - and the same recruiter that first
04:41 - contacted me from Google contacted me
04:44 - again and said that they would would
04:46 - like me to come out to Mountain View
04:48 - California
04:49 - and do five interviews over the course
04:53 - of a day out at at their main campus in
04:56 - Mountain View
04:57 - so I was I was totally stunned that guy
05:00 - I mean I honestly did not think that
05:03 - that was a possibility even when I got
05:05 - the phone call I'm expecting like wow
05:07 - this was really nice that you know she
05:10 - took the time to call me and tell me
05:11 - that I didn't move on to the next round
05:15 - you know but it was so pleasantly
05:19 - surprised and so happy so at that point
05:23 - I'm be 100% honest I had quit studying
05:26 - for the Google interviews because I just
05:28 - I just thought there's no way you know
05:32 - because you you always hear how hard it
05:34 - is to get into Google and how talented
05:36 - the people that work there are and I
05:37 - just didn't consider myself at that
05:39 - level yet but anyway I get the I get
05:44 - moved on to the next round right so the
05:47 - way the process works Google handles
05:49 - everything your flights your hotel I
05:54 - scheduled all the flights we flew out
05:58 - this was maybe this was really shortly
06:02 - after I got I got the call because I had
06:04 - some other job offers and I didn't want
06:06 - to keep them waiting so normally there'd
06:08 - be a little bit more time but for me I
06:10 - think it was less than a week between
06:11 - when I found out I was going to go for
06:14 - the interviews and then me actually
06:16 - flying out there so I go out to Mountain
06:20 - View and I get there kind of like any
06:24 - evening I have one night in the hotel
06:26 - and in the morning I wake up I go to my
06:29 - interviews so I'll give you a little
06:32 - play-by-play of how it went I thought
06:35 - that my first interview was at 9:30 so I
06:38 - got there early enough for that
06:40 - and it turns out my first interview
06:42 - wasn't until I think like 10:15 a.m. so
06:46 - that was okay I was just there early
06:48 - which is better than being late but it
06:51 - gave me some time to just sit there and
06:53 - be nervous but I they came they got me
06:58 - for my first interview they took me to
07:01 - so this building had so many rooms right
07:05 - this is one of many buildings on campus
07:07 - there are a lot of rooms so they
07:10 - actually took me first to another
07:13 - building so we left the first building
07:15 - went to another building and went into a
07:20 - room there and I had two interviews
07:21 - back-to-back in in that particular room
07:25 - so I think those two interviews went
07:28 - well those were probably my best
07:30 - interviews both of those were very
07:32 - front-end related so no data structure
07:34 - algorithm stuff more like Dom
07:37 - manipulation you know just kind of like
07:41 - basic like handling of data you know
07:43 - using for loops and things like that so
07:47 - yeah not bad I felt like I had kind of a
07:50 - good good conversations with with my
07:53 - interviewers so I was feeling pretty
07:57 - good after that I I think my first
08:02 - interview I probably did the best the
08:04 - second interview I think I wished that I
08:08 - would have had a little bit more time so
08:10 - it's like I had a solution but it was
08:12 - like I had ideas to make it make it
08:15 - better so then after that I think after
08:21 - that was that will dinner was lunch
08:23 - right so then they have a Google
08:26 - employee escort you to the cafeteria and
08:30 - you have lunch that's not part of the
08:32 - interview process so you're not being
08:34 - judged on what you talked about at lunch
08:36 - I've heard stories of people saying that
08:38 - you you are it may have been in the past
08:41 - that that happened but they told me
08:44 - several times throughout the day that
08:47 - that's not part of the any of you
08:48 - process like it just relax to was cool I
08:51 - got to talk to a guy who worked
08:53 - on the the pixel three the hardware for
08:56 - the pixel three and I had just bought a
08:58 - pixel three so it was kind of cool I
09:00 - could we could talk about it and yeah so
09:04 - it was nice and I got a really had like
09:07 - some really honest answers about things
09:08 - like you know housing especially with a
09:11 - family
09:12 - this guy had a few kids and you know
09:15 - talking about how long is your commute
09:17 - you know and and how long you know how
09:19 - much does it cost to live around here so
09:21 - that was that was a lot of good good
09:23 - info for me you know you know I have
09:26 - four kids and so that's you know being
09:29 - able to find a place that can fit for
09:31 - kids is important so I go back into my
09:37 - original building after that and find a
09:41 - room and it takes a little while to find
09:44 - the room I think we got lost this is how
09:46 - big Google's campus is people who have
09:48 - been employed there for a while we're
09:51 - actually getting lost trying to find the
09:53 - room where the interview interviews were
09:55 - in so my next interview actually I think
09:58 - I missed out on at least like 10 to 15
10:01 - minutes of the time for the interview
10:02 - because my interviewer got lost on the
10:04 - way over so that really messed me up for
10:08 - that particular interview and for that
10:09 - one I actually got to use a laptop with
10:13 - a code editor all the other interviews
10:16 - were all just on a whiteboard with a
10:17 - marker so I really wish I would have had
10:21 - the full amount of interview time for
10:22 - that because I definitely knew how to
10:24 - solve the problem I just had such a
10:27 - small amount of time it was difficult I
10:30 - will say this to of my interviewers had
10:34 - really heavy accents it was difficult
10:37 - for me to understand and that definitely
10:40 - threw me so I mean that's I kind of
10:46 - didn't expect that but it does make a
10:50 - difference right like when you are
10:52 - interviewing with somebody that speaks
10:54 - the same language like natively and is
10:56 - basically a part of the same like
10:58 - culture it's easy to pick up on lots of
11:00 - cues even like nonverbal cues like
11:02 - manners of speaking and to get some
11:04 - feedback you
11:06 - just just by talking but when you're
11:08 - talking to somebody who is a non-native
11:11 - speaker of your language who kind of
11:16 - pretty obviously you know came over you
11:19 - know to your country later in life right
11:21 - it's a lot harder to pick up on those
11:24 - cues I'm not sure if are they happy with
11:28 - my answer they're not happy with my
11:29 - answer then you know are they annoyed at
11:31 - this point are they joking or they yeah
11:33 - it was really hard to get a read so that
11:36 - definitely threw me off for for two of
11:39 - the interviews and then so the last two
11:44 - interviews were again on a whiteboard
11:47 - you know writing out all my code so that
11:54 - was those the interview process I will
11:56 - say you definitely need to be
11:59 - comfortable talking while you're
12:02 - rewriting out your code that's a big
12:04 - thing I kept being reminded of that by
12:08 - the preparation emails that Google sent
12:12 - me all the training materials that they
12:14 - sent me which they do send you training
12:16 - materials some of the books that I got
12:18 - so one book that was a big help was
12:21 - cracking the coding interview which was
12:23 - recommended to me by several people
12:26 - definitely helpful the algorithm stuff
12:29 - not so helpful because I didn't get
12:30 - asked about that but the general you
12:33 - know interview prep and just the
12:35 - explanation that the book gives about
12:38 - what the interviewers are looking for
12:40 - you know and what they're thinking
12:42 - definitely helps help me to kind of
12:45 - guide the answers I gave and what I
12:47 - focused on so I kind of I left the
12:50 - interviews with about the same feeling
12:52 - that I had from that first technical
12:56 - interview that I had over the phone
12:57 - which was this was easier than I thought
13:00 - it would be but I'm not sure that I did
13:03 - well enough to move on so afterwards
13:07 - they have kind of a candidate Center
13:10 - where you can go and check out some
13:13 - Google products you know use them talk
13:17 - to
13:18 - recruiters about your experience ask
13:21 - questions about Google so I went over
13:23 - there and talked with some of the
13:26 - recruiters that were there and somebody
13:29 - that I know that works at Google came
13:31 - over after some meetings and you know we
13:35 - talked for a while about the interviews
13:37 - and about what it's like for them at
13:39 - Google so that was that was really good
13:43 - it was some good information and it was
13:44 - nice to be able to see them again
13:46 - I had kind of we had both been to some
13:49 - of the same conferences before so it was
13:51 - cool to be able to catch up and then
13:53 - after that I had since since I was
13:56 - coming from the east coast of the US I
14:00 - got to stay another night so I just got
14:04 - stay one more night flew out early the
14:06 - next morning and that was it that was my
14:08 - my process so that was on I think I got
14:13 - back on a Friday and then I got a call
14:16 - Monday night from my recruiter letting
14:19 - me know that I would not be moving on
14:22 - and essentially moving on at that point
14:24 - means getting an offer right there's a
14:28 - couple steps that need to go on on
14:29 - Google's end of things to determine how
14:32 - much to offer and you know what team I
14:35 - would be on but for the candidate at
14:39 - that point you you pretty much are just
14:41 - waiting to hear whether or not you get
14:42 - an offer so didn't get the offer of
14:46 - course you know I was a little bit
14:48 - disappointed but I didn't really have an
14:51 - expectation of getting the authors the
14:55 - offer so I mean I don't know if that was
14:56 - like realistic like if that was imposter
15:00 - syndrome or me just trying to brace
15:01 - myself for to not be disappointed but I
15:07 - had some great offers and if you want to
15:11 - hear more about the other offers and
15:12 - everything check out my last video on my
15:14 - my job interview experience but it was
15:19 - almost a relief to me because then it I
15:23 - had I had lots of options and it made it
15:27 - hard to make a decision so that just
15:28 - took one option off the table and it
15:31 - took
15:31 - of our decisions off the table for me
15:33 - mainly moving my family all the way
15:37 - across the country going somewhere where
15:39 - you know we didn't really know we didn't
15:43 - know anybody I mean I knew one person
15:45 - from some conferences but like you know
15:48 - my kids didn't know anybody maybe one of
15:50 - different schools so it was it would be
15:52 - a big big move and it would have been a
15:54 - hard decision especially if the salary
15:57 - would have been you know competitive
15:59 - with the other offers which I'm assuming
16:01 - it would be because you know Google
16:03 - can't afford to do that it would have
16:06 - been a heartbreaking decision either way
16:08 - to move would have been heartbreaking to
16:11 - move away from family and then but to
16:13 - turn down Google would have been
16:15 - heartbreaking as well because you have
16:18 - the opportunity to build things
16:19 - sometimes that are really cutting edge
16:21 - that you couldn't build anywhere else
16:22 - you have the opportunity to build things
16:24 - that are used by millions of people
16:25 - which is it's a rare a rare thing you
16:29 - also the fact that you would have Google
16:30 - on your resume would help so much in you
16:35 - know future job opportunities so I'm
16:38 - almost I'm glad I actually am glad that
16:43 - I didn't have to make that decision
16:45 - because it would have no matter what I
16:48 - mean it's almost like I don't know it
16:54 - would have been good either way I'm sure
16:56 - it would have worked out well but it
16:57 - also would have involved a lot of
17:01 - sadness either way so overall it was a
17:05 - wonderful experience for me
17:06 - it's just to be able to get as far as I
17:10 - did in the process was was amazing
17:15 - it it I get I think it helped me to see
17:19 - how far I'd come and how much my sales
17:22 - had increased it's it's just hard to
17:25 - know there's not R it's not like you can
17:28 - take a developer test and it'll tell you
17:31 - how good of a developer you are really
17:32 - it's just you know but being able to get
17:35 - that that far in an interview with a
17:37 - company that interview so many people
17:40 - you know they really know what they're
17:41 - doing if the interview process and
17:42 - they're notoriously challenging
17:44 - it was it was good you know it kind of
17:47 - gave me a confidence that I think has
17:52 - already had an impact on on me and my
17:55 - work and I think it will continue to so
17:59 - definitely if you ever get the chance to
18:03 - interview at Google especially for
18:05 - front-end developer job I would say this
18:08 - practice doing front-end type of
18:12 - problems so you know go online you can
18:15 - go on free code camp or whatever and
18:17 - just take some of their challenges their
18:18 - practice challenges javascript stuff and
18:23 - practice writing the solution out if you
18:28 - have a whiteboard doing on a whiteboard
18:29 - have piece of paper do on a piece of
18:31 - paper have somebody there or at least
18:34 - record it and talk while you're doing it
18:37 - watch the recording make sure there's no
18:39 - awkward silences that is probably the
18:42 - key the feedback I got was that I
18:44 - definitely knew JavaScript but I just
18:47 - couldn't write clean code fast enough so
18:50 - I think if I would have spent more time
18:54 - doing that I probably would have had a
18:58 - much better shot of of actually getting
19:00 - an offer all right so just work work on
19:05 - that on your speed and accuracy of
19:08 - handwriting code without the aid of your
19:13 - developer tools or your code editor or
19:16 - anything like that and definitely if
19:19 - you're not used to talking while you're
19:20 - coding work on that as much as possible
19:22 - even if you have to narrate to yourself
19:24 - while you code that's that's a big deal
19:28 - that your interviewers need to know
19:30 - what's going on inside your head what
19:32 - you're thinking because what you're
19:34 - thinking is is almost it's it's more
19:38 - important to them than actually solving
19:40 - the problem if they like the way you
19:42 - think and you approach problems then you
19:46 - can get an offer even without having
19:47 - solved the problem but even if you solve
19:50 - the problem and you don't let them know
19:52 - at all how you knew it it's it's not
19:54 - that helpful to them so anyway
19:58 - my experience that's my advice videos a
20:02 - little bit longer than I expected it to
20:03 - be if you stuck around this long thank
20:05 - you so much let me know if there's
20:09 - anything else you want to know about
20:10 - about my interview process or any other
20:13 - topics you'd like me to cover you can
20:16 - comment in this video reach out to me
20:17 - directly I'm on Twitter I'm on Instagram
20:20 - and you know please think about
20:24 - subscribing if you if you want to see
20:26 - more videos like the video that'll let
20:28 - me know that you want me to keep the one
20:31 - more so until next time have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's me Jesse and I just want to tell you a little bit about my Google interview experience so my last video I talked about the overall job hunting experience and I mentioned the Google interview a little bit but several of you asked for more details so here they are when I first put out my message on Twitter that I was looking for for work I got a response from a Google recruiter and which was amazing right I had previously I had applied to positions at Google for their Pittsburgh office and even even with a reference I still couldn't even get an interview so I was pretty amazed at that that just I guess it kind of shows like the power of having a good Twitter network so I got an email from a recruiter or it might have been a DM on Twitter actually I don't remember for sure but either way message back and forth a little bit set up a phone call so that first phone call was just with the recruiter and I and we just talked like about what what I do what my my past experience was and what I'm interested in now and then we talked a little bit about the role at Google and whether or not I'd be interested in it so you know really basic no no technical questions or anything like that and then after that the next step was to set me up with a technical interview over the phone so the way we did it was I had a Google Doc so there was a link to a Google Doc a shared Google Doc I went there and then I was asked a coding question and I had to type out my answer in the Google Doc so to my surprise the question was actually way more frontend oriented oriented and didn't have much to do with data structures or algorithms I had heard you know from from other people from from sources online and in books that you needed to know your data structures and algorithms to work at Google but I I didn't have any this was basically just a frontend based question so it may disappoint some of you to know that I'm not gonna give you the exact questions I don't think that would be that helpful actually because the odds of getting the same question are very slim each interviewer has freedom to ask you know whatever questions they want to ask so it's it probably wouldn't be that that helpful anyway but it was more frontend oriented I got to use JavaScript and I I thought that I did okay on it it seemed easier than I expected and I didn't I wasn't really expecting to move on to the next round although I did better than I thought it just I wasn't expecting it right to prepare I had looked at some like online training so there are several websites out there that will let you do algorithm problems and just test yourself on them so there's a website called pram PRA MP and you can actually interview with other people so the way it works is you schedule time the first I think half hour one person interviews the other one and then you switch roles and then you go for another I believe it's a half an hour so I did a little bit of that and that was kind of nice just to practice like talking through things I mean through the live coding that I do for free code camp I was already used to talking through coding so that wasn't really a big deal for me but it was it was good to like be under pressure with a question that you don't know beforehand so on the front end related stuff I did great on any time I try to do a date algorithm problem I was not great with that but luckily the first interview all front end ended up getting a call back and the same recruiter that first contacted me from Google contacted me again and said that they would would like me to come out to Mountain View California and do five interviews over the course of a day out at at their main campus in Mountain View so I was I was totally stunned that guy I mean I honestly did not think that that was a possibility even when I got the phone call I'm expecting like wow this was really nice that you know she took the time to call me and tell me that I didn't move on to the next round you know but it was so pleasantly surprised and so happy so at that point I'm be 100% honest I had quit studying for the Google interviews because I just I just thought there's no way you know because you you always hear how hard it is to get into Google and how talented the people that work there are and I just didn't consider myself at that level yet but anyway I get the I get moved on to the next round right so the way the process works Google handles everything your flights your hotel I scheduled all the flights we flew out this was maybe this was really shortly after I got I got the call because I had some other job offers and I didn't want to keep them waiting so normally there'd be a little bit more time but for me I think it was less than a week between when I found out I was going to go for the interviews and then me actually flying out there so I go out to Mountain View and I get there kind of like any evening I have one night in the hotel and in the morning I wake up I go to my interviews so I'll give you a little playbyplay of how it went I thought that my first interview was at 930 so I got there early enough for that and it turns out my first interview wasn't until I think like 1015 a.m. so that was okay I was just there early which is better than being late but it gave me some time to just sit there and be nervous but I they came they got me for my first interview they took me to so this building had so many rooms right this is one of many buildings on campus there are a lot of rooms so they actually took me first to another building so we left the first building went to another building and went into a room there and I had two interviews backtoback in in that particular room so I think those two interviews went well those were probably my best interviews both of those were very frontend related so no data structure algorithm stuff more like Dom manipulation you know just kind of like basic like handling of data you know using for loops and things like that so yeah not bad I felt like I had kind of a good good conversations with with my interviewers so I was feeling pretty good after that I I think my first interview I probably did the best the second interview I think I wished that I would have had a little bit more time so it's like I had a solution but it was like I had ideas to make it make it better so then after that I think after that was that will dinner was lunch right so then they have a Google employee escort you to the cafeteria and you have lunch that's not part of the interview process so you're not being judged on what you talked about at lunch I've heard stories of people saying that you you are it may have been in the past that that happened but they told me several times throughout the day that that's not part of the any of you process like it just relax to was cool I got to talk to a guy who worked on the the pixel three the hardware for the pixel three and I had just bought a pixel three so it was kind of cool I could we could talk about it and yeah so it was nice and I got a really had like some really honest answers about things like you know housing especially with a family this guy had a few kids and you know talking about how long is your commute you know and and how long you know how much does it cost to live around here so that was that was a lot of good good info for me you know you know I have four kids and so that's you know being able to find a place that can fit for kids is important so I go back into my original building after that and find a room and it takes a little while to find the room I think we got lost this is how big Google's campus is people who have been employed there for a while we're actually getting lost trying to find the room where the interview interviews were in so my next interview actually I think I missed out on at least like 10 to 15 minutes of the time for the interview because my interviewer got lost on the way over so that really messed me up for that particular interview and for that one I actually got to use a laptop with a code editor all the other interviews were all just on a whiteboard with a marker so I really wish I would have had the full amount of interview time for that because I definitely knew how to solve the problem I just had such a small amount of time it was difficult I will say this to of my interviewers had really heavy accents it was difficult for me to understand and that definitely threw me so I mean that's I kind of didn't expect that but it does make a difference right like when you are interviewing with somebody that speaks the same language like natively and is basically a part of the same like culture it's easy to pick up on lots of cues even like nonverbal cues like manners of speaking and to get some feedback you just just by talking but when you're talking to somebody who is a nonnative speaker of your language who kind of pretty obviously you know came over you know to your country later in life right it's a lot harder to pick up on those cues I'm not sure if are they happy with my answer they're not happy with my answer then you know are they annoyed at this point are they joking or they yeah it was really hard to get a read so that definitely threw me off for for two of the interviews and then so the last two interviews were again on a whiteboard you know writing out all my code so that was those the interview process I will say you definitely need to be comfortable talking while you're rewriting out your code that's a big thing I kept being reminded of that by the preparation emails that Google sent me all the training materials that they sent me which they do send you training materials some of the books that I got so one book that was a big help was cracking the coding interview which was recommended to me by several people definitely helpful the algorithm stuff not so helpful because I didn't get asked about that but the general you know interview prep and just the explanation that the book gives about what the interviewers are looking for you know and what they're thinking definitely helps help me to kind of guide the answers I gave and what I focused on so I kind of I left the interviews with about the same feeling that I had from that first technical interview that I had over the phone which was this was easier than I thought it would be but I'm not sure that I did well enough to move on so afterwards they have kind of a candidate Center where you can go and check out some Google products you know use them talk to recruiters about your experience ask questions about Google so I went over there and talked with some of the recruiters that were there and somebody that I know that works at Google came over after some meetings and you know we talked for a while about the interviews and about what it's like for them at Google so that was that was really good it was some good information and it was nice to be able to see them again I had kind of we had both been to some of the same conferences before so it was cool to be able to catch up and then after that I had since since I was coming from the east coast of the US I got to stay another night so I just got stay one more night flew out early the next morning and that was it that was my my process so that was on I think I got back on a Friday and then I got a call Monday night from my recruiter letting me know that I would not be moving on and essentially moving on at that point means getting an offer right there's a couple steps that need to go on on Google's end of things to determine how much to offer and you know what team I would be on but for the candidate at that point you you pretty much are just waiting to hear whether or not you get an offer so didn't get the offer of course you know I was a little bit disappointed but I didn't really have an expectation of getting the authors the offer so I mean I don't know if that was like realistic like if that was imposter syndrome or me just trying to brace myself for to not be disappointed but I had some great offers and if you want to hear more about the other offers and everything check out my last video on my my job interview experience but it was almost a relief to me because then it I had I had lots of options and it made it hard to make a decision so that just took one option off the table and it took of our decisions off the table for me mainly moving my family all the way across the country going somewhere where you know we didn't really know we didn't know anybody I mean I knew one person from some conferences but like you know my kids didn't know anybody maybe one of different schools so it was it would be a big big move and it would have been a hard decision especially if the salary would have been you know competitive with the other offers which I'm assuming it would be because you know Google can't afford to do that it would have been a heartbreaking decision either way to move would have been heartbreaking to move away from family and then but to turn down Google would have been heartbreaking as well because you have the opportunity to build things sometimes that are really cutting edge that you couldn't build anywhere else you have the opportunity to build things that are used by millions of people which is it's a rare a rare thing you also the fact that you would have Google on your resume would help so much in you know future job opportunities so I'm almost I'm glad I actually am glad that I didn't have to make that decision because it would have no matter what I mean it's almost like I don't know it would have been good either way I'm sure it would have worked out well but it also would have involved a lot of sadness either way so overall it was a wonderful experience for me it's just to be able to get as far as I did in the process was was amazing it it I get I think it helped me to see how far I'd come and how much my sales had increased it's it's just hard to know there's not R it's not like you can take a developer test and it'll tell you how good of a developer you are really it's just you know but being able to get that that far in an interview with a company that interview so many people you know they really know what they're doing if the interview process and they're notoriously challenging it was it was good you know it kind of gave me a confidence that I think has already had an impact on on me and my work and I think it will continue to so definitely if you ever get the chance to interview at Google especially for frontend developer job I would say this practice doing frontend type of problems so you know go online you can go on free code camp or whatever and just take some of their challenges their practice challenges javascript stuff and practice writing the solution out if you have a whiteboard doing on a whiteboard have piece of paper do on a piece of paper have somebody there or at least record it and talk while you're doing it watch the recording make sure there's no awkward silences that is probably the key the feedback I got was that I definitely knew JavaScript but I just couldn't write clean code fast enough so I think if I would have spent more time doing that I probably would have had a much better shot of of actually getting an offer all right so just work work on that on your speed and accuracy of handwriting code without the aid of your developer tools or your code editor or anything like that and definitely if you're not used to talking while you're coding work on that as much as possible even if you have to narrate to yourself while you code that's that's a big deal that your interviewers need to know what's going on inside your head what you're thinking because what you're thinking is is almost it's it's more important to them than actually solving the problem if they like the way you think and you approach problems then you can get an offer even without having solved the problem but even if you solve the problem and you don't let them know at all how you knew it it's it's not that helpful to them so anyway my experience that's my advice videos a little bit longer than I expected it to be if you stuck around this long thank you so much let me know if there's anything else you want to know about about my interview process or any other topics you'd like me to cover you can comment in this video reach out to me directly I'm on Twitter I'm on Instagram and you know please think about subscribing if you if you want to see more videos like the video that'll let me know that you want me to keep the one more so until next time have a great day
