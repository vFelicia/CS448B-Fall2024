00:05 - hey everybody welcome to
00:07 - live coding with jesse
00:08 - i'm jesse and today we're going to work
00:11 - on an old project
00:14 - and i i already started working on it
00:17 - and it ended up being a lot easier than
00:19 - i thought so i've already finished
00:23 - what i said i was gonna do for this
00:25 - video
00:26 - uh but what i will do is i'll go through
00:28 - everything
00:30 - that i've done and if there's a chance
00:32 - to refactor
00:34 - or improve it in any way we'll do that
00:39 - this would be kind of cool to revisit
00:41 - that that first project that we did just
00:44 - kind of go through the code i know you
00:46 - know some of you were involved in that
00:47 - first project but you know a lot of you
00:49 - watching probably weren't
00:52 - so
00:53 - some of this will be new to you and
00:57 - i don't know i always think it's kind of
00:59 - fun to go back and look at old projects
01:01 - and and this is a project we were
01:02 - working on
01:03 - at least six months ago maybe
01:06 - probably more
01:08 - so it'll be cool to see how long how far
01:10 - we've come you know
01:13 - hopefully i've i've improved since then
01:17 - so it'll be fun and that's cool this
01:19 - would be kind of more laid back uh my my
01:21 - throat's just after yesterday's stream
01:25 - uh my voice sounded all you know messed
01:27 - up
01:28 - so
01:30 - maybe it's better that this is laid back
01:33 - uh i just want to start out too by
01:36 - showing you something i got today so i
01:39 - work at a university right so i got a
01:41 - knock on the door which is weird because
01:43 - nobody comes to my office
01:45 - but it was a student
01:48 - and who i don't know
01:50 - and they had
01:52 - some
01:53 - some stuff and they're gonna give me
01:54 - this card so
01:56 - i got a a thank you card and i'm gonna
01:58 - cover up the phone number here in case
02:00 - but i got this thank you card
02:03 - from a student here you kind of see it
02:06 - says dear jesse at the top but
02:09 - um
02:11 - i just kind of wanted to share this is a
02:12 - student that i i kind of mentored
02:15 - um last year
02:17 - and
02:18 - he he wasn't a computer science major he
02:21 - was a communications art major but he
02:23 - was taking a web design course
02:26 - and for his project he
02:29 - he wanted to do
02:30 - like a really cool website so i helped
02:33 - him out with he had some parallax stuff
02:35 - going on that was really cool
02:37 - and uh you you all know that i'm partial
02:40 - to parallax
02:41 - um
02:42 - and then he also
02:44 - wanted to grab data
02:47 - using
02:48 - i think i think he ended up using ajax
02:52 - i don't yeah i think he was using ajax
02:55 - uh to grab some data
02:57 - from a google sheet
02:59 - so he had all his data in a spreadsheet
03:01 - so i kind of you know helped him out
03:02 - with that and he'd come into my office
03:05 - and and we'd sit down and and talk about
03:07 - it and check out the code and
03:09 - uh so it was cool but
03:12 - i don't know i just wanted to share it
03:14 - so i'm gonna the card's just really
03:16 - really small so i just kind of want to
03:17 - share
03:18 - uh just as an example of
03:21 - i guess if you take the time to help
03:23 - someone out
03:24 - it can make a big impact on their life
03:26 - it it might not be that big of a deal it
03:29 - might not seem like that big of a deal
03:31 - but it is you know it was a big enough
03:32 - deal for a student to leave me a gift
03:35 - and a card
03:36 - uh you know after everything
03:39 - so it says hey i just wanted to write
03:40 - you a quick thank you for all your help
03:42 - this last semester i honestly couldn't
03:44 - have done it without you
03:46 - so thanks i can see your live stream has
03:49 - been going good i hope you're the next

05:18 - uh sergio says hey i just want you to
05:21 - know that i like the coding with
05:22 - jessie's series thank you for saying
05:24 - that i really appreciate that comments
05:27 - comments like that make me want to keep
05:29 - doing it
05:30 - um
05:32 - let's see
05:35 - monier says hey guys check out my daily
05:38 - coding life on instagram it's
05:41 - e-l-h-r-i-m-o-u-n-i-r
05:45 - cool i'll um
05:48 - off to check it out
05:50 - i'm gonna copy and paste that right now
05:54 - and
05:59 - uh
05:59 - that way i won't forget i'll check it
06:01 - out check it out later
06:03 - yeah that's a good actually i'm on
06:04 - instagram as well
06:06 - so i do
06:08 - i don't know just some coding stuff from
06:10 - time to time sometimes i just post
06:11 - things from from my life like me with my
06:14 - kids or like
06:15 - food
06:16 - but i do post a lot of coding stuff as
06:18 - well
06:19 - so if you're on instagram
06:24 - and you want to see some of that stuff
06:25 - let me know
06:27 - and if you're doing coding stuff on
06:28 - instagram i'd love to see it so
06:31 - um
06:32 - you know again just let me know i think
06:35 - it'd be
06:36 - i'm trying to follow like as many coders
06:38 - as i can
06:40 - uh on instagram
06:42 - uh
06:43 - it's kind of like twitter has their
06:45 - thing but instagram seems to have this
06:46 - whole different community of coders that
06:48 - kind of do
06:50 - it's like at a different vibe to it so i
06:53 - think it's just kind of cool to see
06:56 - i don't know the differences like
06:58 - twitter seems to be like all about like
07:00 - business you know like let's really talk
07:03 - about the code instagram seems to be
07:05 - more of a mix of here's what i'm doing
07:06 - with the code but then here's kind of
07:08 - how my lifestyle like
07:11 - here's how i handle work-life balance
07:13 - and health and
07:15 - so it i don't know it's kind of cool to
07:17 - see that side of
07:20 - of you know my fellow coders so anyway
07:23 - sorry for the long intro
07:25 - that
07:26 - uh talk but
07:29 - let me go
07:31 - sorry i still have that cough
07:33 - i'm gonna try my best
07:35 - uh i have my g fuel today
07:38 - so g fuel if you're watching
07:41 - hook me up i'll give you shout outs in
07:43 - every video
07:48 - just hook me up with like
07:50 - one tub of pink lemonade flavor
07:53 - i'll give you shout outs for
07:56 - for a whole month
08:00 - um
08:01 - all right we did have a lot of pull
08:03 - requests so
08:05 - after we do the code
08:07 - when i go to answer questions at the end
08:09 - the first part of it i'm going to check
08:12 - the uh the pull request
08:15 - i'm going to check those out and i'm
08:16 - going to give credit where it's due to
08:18 - those of you that submitted some pull
08:19 - requests so i really appreciate that
08:23 - okay cool
08:24 - uh moneer i i did get your uh
08:28 - your friend request on instagram on my
08:30 - phone so
08:32 - i will be following you
08:34 - as soon as i'm done
08:36 - thank you
08:38 - all right so enough of my face let's go
08:41 - to some code
08:44 - so this is
08:46 - our old project and this is the page
08:48 - where i've done the most and
08:51 - it looks like a lot but most of it was
08:53 - copy and paste so
08:55 - that's why i ended up being really easy
08:57 - because i when i first
08:59 - made the video and said i was going to
09:00 - work on this it didn't occur to me that
09:02 - we already had a page that was doing
09:04 - everything that we wanted this new page
09:06 - to do
09:07 - so
09:09 - i had to do a little bit of work in
09:10 - wordpress too i'll go over what i've
09:12 - i've done there
09:14 - and
09:16 - let's see let's turn on the pomodoro
09:18 - clock okay so first things first let me
09:21 - show you what i wanted
09:23 - on the screen i think that's a lot
09:24 - easier to show at first
09:26 - and then go to the code
09:29 - so here's what i wanted a new page
09:31 - called mentor training
09:33 - well when i say i want it i mean the the
09:35 - people that are making the site who are
09:37 - wanted uh we want an intro section which
09:40 - right now it's just uh some bacon ipsum
09:43 - um and then
09:45 - this table if you remember this project
09:48 - this table should look familiar this is
09:50 - the nearby events table we've just
09:53 - changed the name
09:54 - now what i'm not sure about i remember
09:56 - talking about this in a meeting months
09:58 - ago but i
10:00 - wasn't sure if we came to like a
10:03 - conclusion for sure on what these fields
10:05 - should be
10:06 - i vaguely remember basically saying just
10:09 - let me know what field you want and i'll
10:11 - do it and i don't know if i ever got
10:14 - a list so right now they have the same
10:16 - fields here like the same
10:20 - same headers
10:22 - and this data i'm pulling the nearby
10:24 - events data just to give us some sample
10:26 - data
10:27 - because i don't have any real data for
10:29 - these mentor training sessions yet
10:32 - but i did invite
10:35 - the person in charge of content to come
10:37 - edit the wordpress site and and put in
10:40 - some some data so hopefully we'll get
10:42 - some of that soon
10:44 - obviously i'm not going to go live with
10:46 - this until i get the data and contest it
10:48 - if you remember in this project we have
10:50 - a test server on digitalocean and then
10:51 - we have two live servers that we're load
10:53 - balancing between
10:56 - we also have another server where
10:58 - wordpress is running and that's where
11:00 - the data we're getting all the data from
11:02 - uh so you can see
11:04 - with this table
11:06 - it works
11:08 - really well on mobile one of the
11:09 - problems with tables
11:11 - is that often
11:13 - tables don't work actually i changed
11:15 - this and now it goes over so maybe i'll
11:18 - um
11:19 - i'll fix that
11:21 - i'm not sure if we're even going to need
11:22 - that
11:23 - heading anyway
11:24 - but normally you have a table and you
11:27 - try to go it's fine on a large screen
11:29 - but you try to shrink it down
11:31 - and there's like all this table out here
11:34 - and
11:35 - you scroll you have to scroll over and
11:37 - that's not not a good thing you never
11:40 - want to have your users have to scroll
11:42 - horizontally on mobile
11:46 - so that's why we went with this type of
11:47 - table
11:48 - so i didn't come up with everything on
11:50 - this table it's just a modified version
11:52 - of what materialized css had so in this
11:55 - project we're not using material ui like
11:58 - we did in later projects in this project
12:00 - we took materialized css which is not
12:03 - really intended for react but we made it
12:05 - work
12:06 - eventually i'd like to
12:09 - redo this
12:10 - so that we switch everything over to
12:12 - material ui
12:14 - because we have some jquery going on i'd
12:16 - rather not have jquery in here
12:18 - but for now it's it's working
12:20 - so
12:22 - i'm okay with it
12:26 - and
12:27 - on so with materialize the way the table
12:30 - works is by default is when you get a
12:32 - large screen it looks like a normal
12:35 - table with your your headers your
12:37 - headings up at the top
12:40 - and then when you go small to small
12:42 - screen it changes well that didn't
12:44 - exactly work for us we still had a lot
12:46 - of headings so
12:47 - uh just modify it slightly
12:50 - to always be uh in the mobile version
12:55 - and we added in some things like we
12:57 - added in
12:58 - some of these uh icons so you can move
13:01 - back and forth
13:02 - uh otherwise like normally it was just
13:05 - scroll but we've we kind of found it
13:07 - wasn't 100 obvious that you could scroll
13:11 - um we we've also added in some sorting
13:14 - so you can see we can sort by date
13:18 - i believe we can sort
13:20 - we can sort by location as well
13:24 - i think
13:26 - oh you know it's not working because the
13:28 - location data wasn't put in
13:30 - i'll show you where where we need to
13:32 - enter it in it was kind of tricky um
13:36 - to get the right data for that
13:38 - so
13:39 - it actually does
13:40 - assuming you give it permission which i
13:42 - have it will get your location
13:45 - and use it to show you which one is
13:47 - closest
13:48 - and which ones are farther away
13:51 - all right so
13:53 - let's look at the wordpress install
13:56 - right now
13:57 - so basically i made a page
13:59 - called mentor training intro would hat
14:02 - which has the data for that and we'll
14:03 - see where i pull that in
14:10 - and
14:11 - i made a
14:14 - custom post type called mentor trainings
14:17 - you see there's nothing there right now
14:19 - let me zoom in a bit and show you so we
14:22 - have normal we have the date and we have
14:23 - display date this is important because
14:25 - we want
14:26 - we want the date in a format that's
14:28 - easily readable by javascript so that's
14:31 - why we have the date here but then we
14:33 - also want the date displayed in a way
14:36 - that's easily readable by humans
14:39 - so i have two different fields
14:41 - just a little bit more work but it gives
14:42 - us a lot of freedom with how we want to
14:44 - display the date and right now it's
14:46 - uh you know the month in the day comma
14:49 - year
14:51 - um do you have a question about will you
14:53 - upload the video to watch later yes i
14:55 - will i will definitely so if you can't
14:56 - stick around don't worry about it uh
14:58 - i'll answer your questions and i'll
15:00 - upload the video and you can just check
15:02 - in later if you need to
15:04 - um what else we have okay so we have
15:06 - location here and this is just
15:09 - the
15:10 - the location text that will show up to
15:13 - the user so we're usually just doing
15:15 - like city and then state
15:18 - sometimes i guess if you wanted to you
15:21 - could put an actual address here
15:24 - and then
15:26 - down here is where you put in your
15:27 - actual location
15:29 - so we have
15:31 - a map uh
15:33 - yeah this is a google map yes we have a
15:34 - google map
15:36 - you can search for an address
15:38 - and put a pin in there
15:40 - and then it will send the exact
15:43 - coordinates
15:45 - for that location and then that's how
15:48 - we're comparing the coordinates that are
15:51 - given when
15:53 - we turn on the geolocation for the
15:55 - browser we compare that to the
15:56 - coordinates that we're given from that
15:58 - google map for each event and that's how
16:00 - we figure out which ones are closer and
16:02 - which ones are farther away
16:05 - so if you want to know more about how we
16:07 - did that go back and check out some of
16:09 - the the early streams the titles are
16:12 - pretty descriptive on those so you will
16:14 - find some about using
16:17 - geolocation
16:19 - with react
16:21 - okay so now that we have all this let's
16:23 - get to the code
16:25 - so here's the actual
16:27 - components
16:31 - and let me
16:32 - make some space here
16:33 - let me know if this font is too small
16:35 - for you all
16:37 - right so nothing really special here
16:39 - we're bringing you if you're familiar
16:41 - with react
16:43 - we're bringing in react we're bringing
16:45 - in some components here
16:47 - and
16:49 - we're pulling in data so we did make
16:52 - uh use next js to build this so we have
16:56 - access to this git initial props
16:57 - function
16:59 - where we can pull in data and then that
17:01 - data is available to us on the server
17:03 - and the client which is awesome and
17:04 - great for server side rendering
17:08 - um
17:09 - awesome hey just got an email from the
17:13 - content manager for this website that
17:14 - we're working on right now let's see
17:16 - what she said
17:33 - all right so nothing she's just gonna
17:35 - add some stuff later on and also wants
17:37 - to have a rough timeline
17:40 - for all the other updates
17:42 - so
17:44 - i was hoping she'd be ready to put some
17:46 - data in we could actually test it
17:48 - um
17:50 - let's see
17:51 - all right so we're in this get initial
17:53 - props function
17:55 - and we're getting so we're using the
17:58 - wordpress rest api so no graphql
18:03 - and um
18:05 - we have
18:07 - we're sending basically this long string
18:10 - saying what we we need to get
18:13 - so we're using a plug-in that lets us
18:15 - get multiple posts and host types in one
18:18 - request so we have multiple post type
18:21 - the trade-off when you use this plug-in
18:23 - is you can't
18:24 - specify
18:26 - a lot of like what you want so
18:28 - we can either get multiple post types
18:30 - and then get everything
18:32 - or
18:34 - we can do one post type and narrow it
18:37 - down and only get certain fields
18:39 - so that was our trade-off uh we but we
18:42 - needed to get more than one post type so
18:44 - that's we ended up doing it like this
18:47 - so right now i'm bringing in nearby
18:49 - events
18:52 - like i said this will change
18:55 - and we'll actually pull in the mentor
18:56 - training
18:58 - dates and locations but right now we
19:00 - don't have that data
19:02 - we're doing some filtering we're going
19:03 - to order it by
19:05 - by date
19:08 - and ascending
19:10 - and we want
19:12 - some of these fields
19:14 - but then on our second type
19:16 - with our page uh so we can't
19:20 - we can't get like different fields so
19:23 - we can say what fields we want but it's
19:25 - it's not gonna we're not gonna be able
19:27 - to do it for more than one post type
19:29 - so for instance with pages we're getting
19:31 - all the pages i can't specify one
19:34 - specific page
19:36 - so down here
19:38 - i need to
19:41 - when i bring in that that intro section
19:46 - i'm going to do a filter so we're going
19:48 - to this props data so the data we get is
19:51 - stored in props and then we're going to
19:53 - filter
19:54 - the post
19:55 - by the slug which is mentor training
19:58 - intro that means it's going to pull that
20:00 - text in that we had
20:02 - in
20:04 - that we had here right it pulls that
20:06 - text in from wordpress and it displays
20:08 - it here
20:10 - uh also there's supposed to be an image
20:11 - back here i don't know uh what would
20:14 - happen but the image quit showing it
20:16 - stopped showing up right before i
20:18 - started the stream so i was in the
20:19 - middle of troubleshooting
20:22 - um so that's how we pull it in
20:26 - and we have
20:28 - just a div
20:30 - and we're setting the the content we're
20:31 - using dangerously set inner html
20:34 - because we want to preserve the html
20:36 - that's coming to us from wordpress
20:39 - and then
20:41 - down here is where we have our
20:44 - our table
20:46 - and we're also doing a map function
20:49 - over that that data that we're pulling
20:51 - in which right now is the nearby event
20:53 - data
20:54 - and we're just mapping over that
20:57 - and adding
21:00 - our
21:01 - tr's and our tds
21:04 - for each one of those
21:07 - so that's not really the exciting part
21:09 - that's kind of like basic
21:11 - react stuff you you just loop over
21:14 - things and add them here's where
21:16 - we're doing some of the
21:18 - the different sorting things
21:22 - so
21:23 - we actually this is where the jquery
21:25 - comes in
21:26 - we have this h scroller function that's
21:29 - being called
21:30 - and
21:31 - we use some some jquery coming from
21:34 - another file
21:36 - to do that but we wait and call it on
21:38 - componentdidmount so
21:40 - we don't have the document.ready
21:42 - function like we'd normally do
21:45 - instead
21:46 - we call our jquery from inside
21:49 - componentdidmount
21:51 - and that way we know
21:53 - that the component and
21:55 - that the the dom elements that we want
21:58 - the jquery to manipulate are actually
22:01 - loaded so that was kind of a little work
22:03 - around that we had to do
22:04 - this is not ideal for react so this is
22:07 - something that we had to do to get the
22:09 - site launched on time
22:11 - we were converting it from a site that
22:13 - already basically was doing all this
22:15 - stuff but it was using jquery so
22:19 - i'm not saying we should do it like this
22:20 - but if you have to do something like
22:22 - this that's how you make the jquery work
22:30 - let me know if you actually want to see
22:31 - how we did this in jquery you know go
22:33 - ahead and
22:34 - i i can for sure
22:36 - show you
22:37 - just let me know in the live chat if
22:38 - you're interested
22:41 - so for the date sorting
22:43 - right we need to get today's date
22:45 - obviously and one thing we're doing is
22:48 - we're not showing
22:50 - any dates
22:52 - that are before today
22:55 - so we automatically don't display events
22:58 - that have already happened
23:00 - right which makes sense the whole point
23:01 - of the table is to find events for you
23:03 - to go to you can't go to it if it
23:05 - already happened
23:07 - so that's why we're grabbing today's
23:09 - date
23:10 - and
23:14 - we're also getting the location so we're
23:16 - using this
23:17 - navigator.geolocation.getcurrentposition
23:20 - and what will happen here is
23:24 - the user will be prompted to allow
23:27 - geolocation
23:29 - if the user allows it
23:31 - then we can get the location if not then
23:33 - the location sorting functionality will
23:35 - not work
23:37 - which is okay that's entirely up to the
23:38 - user if that's something they they would
23:40 - like to do
23:46 - and
23:47 - then we're calling compare location so
23:50 - once we get the user's location
23:52 - and we're out we're saving all this into
23:54 - state
23:55 - so our state
23:57 - see we have user latitude lose user
24:00 - longitude
24:01 - all right we're going to store that
24:03 - there
24:06 - and here's where we're doing some some
24:08 - fun stuff i remember when we made this
24:10 - it was really cool when we got it
24:11 - working
24:12 - so
24:15 - we have
24:18 - our data
24:20 - we made a constant called new data and
24:22 - it's just all the data that we have in
24:24 - in state
24:26 - in this state data
24:29 - and we're mapping
24:31 - over each event
24:34 - okay we've actually
24:38 - taking
24:39 - let me check in here that's a probably
24:41 - location map
24:44 - all right so we're checking to make sure
24:48 - that that event has the location map
24:51 - property
24:52 - right so we don't want to try to do this
24:54 - if the event does not have
24:57 - a value for that we you know that would
25:00 - potentially give us errors or at the
25:02 - very least it would have event show up
25:05 - as being really close or really far away
25:08 - um
25:10 - and it's it's not really true it's just
25:12 - that there's no value there i forget
25:14 - what the what actually happened
25:16 - if we didn't check but that's why we
25:18 - need to check
25:19 - so
25:20 - this is a just kind of a long term area
25:23 - so think of like a ternary like a
25:25 - shorthand for an if statement
25:28 - so
25:31 - if
25:32 - we have this location map
25:36 - property
25:38 - then so after the question mark is then
25:41 - we do this so then we take the user
25:44 - latitude minus
25:47 - the latitude of that event
25:50 - plus
25:52 - the user longitude minus the longitude
25:55 - of the event
25:57 - and what that gives us
26:00 - is a number
26:02 - and the higher the number
26:06 - yeah
26:08 - let me double check i believe it is the
26:10 - higher the number
26:12 - the farther away the event is
26:15 - the lower the number the closer the
26:17 - event is
26:19 - so
26:21 - it ended up being i was a little bit
26:22 - worried about how are we going to judge
26:24 - these distances i was thinking we'd have
26:26 - to make another api call to some other
26:28 - service to get that
26:30 - but no just very simple math i mean
26:31 - literally addition and subtraction
26:34 - got us through here that's why i ended
26:36 - up being really pleased with this
26:37 - because i thought this is such a very
26:38 - like a simple solution to our problem
26:43 - um and then we have
26:45 - uh let's see if there is no location um
26:51 - then we do infinity
26:54 - i forget why we had to do infinity
26:56 - honestly i'd have to go back and watch
26:58 - the stream but this wasn't my idea
27:00 - somebody else put this in here to solve
27:02 - some problem
27:04 - um
27:06 - and then we're just returning
27:08 - uh the event clone
27:10 - which was our constant up here
27:14 - now
27:16 - we can sort
27:20 - all right so if you've never used sword
27:22 - it's actually it's really cool
27:23 - so we're sorting each
27:26 - each item right so a would be like the
27:29 - first item in in this array and then b
27:32 - would be the second item in this array
27:34 - so we remember we have an array of
27:36 - objects that's the format that our data
27:38 - is in
27:39 - so if
27:41 - item one
27:43 - this distance to event
27:47 - here's how we doing
27:48 - sorry this is not if this is
27:51 - uh distance to event minus b distance to
27:54 - event basically what this does is
27:57 - compares all of them
27:59 - and then sorts them
28:01 - so
28:04 - the
28:06 - the ones that have the lowest value will
28:09 - come first
28:10 - and then it'll go up
28:13 - all
28:14 - right we got through that
28:17 - it feel free to ask me to clarify this
28:20 - even more
28:21 - and like if you see something and you're
28:23 - not sure about it
28:25 - you like here it might be a little
28:26 - complicated like check it out on mdn
28:29 - mozilla developer network just type in
28:31 - like javascript.sort it'll be one of the
28:33 - first links
28:34 - and then you could probably get some
28:35 - like more simple examples and a better
28:37 - explanation i'm happy to answer your
28:40 - questions but i know i'm not as good as
28:41 - mdn so that's why i'm just i'm throwing
28:44 - that out there for you
28:46 - all right we're doing a similar thing
28:48 - with the date right so we're sorting by
28:50 - date you can see the same thing we have
28:52 - a
28:53 - um
28:55 - sort
28:57 - are we doing the date sort oh here we
28:59 - are so we have a sort here
29:02 - and
29:07 - um
29:09 - this date sword okay so we're actually
29:12 - able to do ascending and descending with
29:15 - a date and we store that in state why
29:18 - would we store that value in state
29:21 - i feel like i'm a teacher now sorry
29:23 - sorry
29:25 - but we want to store it in state because
29:27 - every time state changes it triggers a
29:29 - re-render in our component so to go back
29:32 - here
29:34 - if i didn't have this saved in state
29:36 - i could click on date all day long and
29:39 - nothing would happen
29:41 - right i could
29:43 - i it would be doing something in the
29:45 - click but it would never trigger a
29:47 - re-render
29:48 - so this isn't like
29:50 - i would put an on click handle on there
29:52 - and it would do stuff that's not how it
29:54 - works and react i mean potentially you
29:56 - could do it but that's not really the
29:57 - react way
30:01 - and
30:03 - so that's why we put that in
30:06 - in state and i've done that for a couple
30:07 - different projects uh some projects that
30:10 - i didn't stream
30:11 - uh is
30:12 - i had to use this for like for my
30:14 - udacity nanodegree some of those
30:16 - projects anytime you have to do any kind
30:18 - of sorting i found it always helpful to
30:21 - put that that sorting in states or if
30:25 - you're using redux you can put it in
30:26 - there as well but when you do that and
30:28 - you have a you know some sort of toggle
30:31 - or even a drop down we have multiple
30:32 - things to sort by
30:34 - it's um
30:37 - that's the way you want to do it to
30:38 - trigger the re-render
30:41 - all right
30:42 - let's see
30:45 - locations
30:48 - okay cool so here we have our our handle
30:50 - sort we're passing in sort by so if this
30:54 - syntax looks weird to you it's it's
30:56 - called an arrow function
30:58 - uh so
31:00 - just if you want to look up more about
31:01 - it type in arrow function javascript
31:04 - you'll see a ton of stuff it's part of
31:05 - the es
31:07 - 6
31:09 - syntax or it it's officially called
31:11 - es2015 but a lot of people say es6
31:14 - so
31:16 - handle sort
31:17 - and then this is the parameter that
31:19 - we're put we're passing in
31:22 - um and
31:24 - then here's our our arrow function
31:26 - because it looks like an arrow so that's
31:27 - the that's where we get the term arrow
31:29 - function from and then anything in here
31:31 - is actually our function
31:33 - so we have this sort by and it's just a
31:36 - switch statement so if we want to sort
31:38 - by date
31:40 - then we have the name date passed in
31:42 - here if we want to sort by location we
31:44 - do that
31:46 - the default is sort date so if we have
31:49 - nothing in here it defaults to sort date
31:53 - and
31:53 - let's see
31:55 - i don't remember why we needed two
31:56 - digits here
32:00 - something i needed to change the two
32:01 - digits so that's why we made this
32:02 - function
32:04 - uh but that's basically it that's how we
32:07 - did this sortable responsive table
32:10 - you can check out uh this
32:12 - code in github i haven't pushed
32:17 - this yet but if you go to the events.js
32:20 - component it has all the same stuff i
32:22 - just copied it from there so you can
32:24 - check it out right now
32:26 - in the repo this project is called ci
32:29 - react
32:30 - so ci hyphen react
32:34 - and
32:37 - uh you can go through that
32:39 - you know feel free to clone the project
32:41 - mess around with it use the code for
32:43 - your own project
32:45 - it's totally cool to do that
32:48 - and
32:49 - let's see so that's
32:53 - that's about it like i said i'm not
32:56 - ready
32:57 - i'm not ready to commit this yet because
32:59 - i messed up
33:02 - oh sorry
33:04 - i messed up something so we don't see
33:06 - the the background image so i don't
33:08 - really want to commit it with you know
33:10 - something messed up
33:13 - so i think i just
33:15 - i changed the id and i think that's what
33:17 - messed it up it's
33:19 - missing some css somewhere that it
33:21 - needed
33:24 - um so potentially i could just change
33:26 - the id back
33:28 - maybe i'll try it right now
33:31 - let's see if it works
33:34 - oh yeah
33:44 - yeah that was it
33:45 - it's just the id so for now actually i
33:48 - will commit this because cancel because
33:50 - the id i'm not doing anything special
33:53 - with this page it's i do want it to be
33:55 - identical to the events page in a sense
33:58 - uh so let me commit this now
34:01 - and that way you all can see everything
34:05 - so just walk you through the the process
34:08 - here i'm going to do a git status
34:10 - now this is on the branch called upgrade
34:12 - i have not put any of this on master yet
34:15 - so
34:16 - just be aware of that it won't be there
34:19 - by default on master you have to change
34:20 - the branch to upgrade i'll show you all
34:22 - how to do that in a second
34:25 - so i've added this and i've changed some
34:28 - things in the title component and i've
34:30 - changed some things in the styles
34:32 - now i just made a few adjustments there
34:35 - are some things that i didn't like how
34:36 - it looked on the page so that's that's
34:38 - what i did in here uh just
34:40 - very small uh adjustments
34:43 - on um
34:44 - just like size of things and padding and
34:46 - margins
34:49 - so let's go
34:50 - git add and i'm going to put a period
34:53 - there and that's going to add everything
34:55 - so now if i do a git status
34:57 - again we can see in green here
35:00 - these are all ready to be committed
35:04 - so now we can do
35:06 - get and when they're ready to be
35:08 - committed that's called being staged
35:11 - uh so
35:12 - this is like these are all in the staged
35:16 - part of
35:18 - the process of git committing
35:20 - so now we're going to commit and i'm
35:22 - going to do a flag dash m which means
35:24 - we're going to do a commit message
35:28 - and let's see we want
35:33 - uh let's see add
35:38 - page admin to our training page looks
35:40 - good
35:45 - oh what's going on
35:48 - i messed up something
35:57 - event section is defined but never used
36:00 - oh okay
36:01 - not a big deal let's check it out so we
36:03 - have
36:05 - some linting that runs
36:07 - and some auto formatting that happens
36:09 - when we go to commit and this is very
36:11 - useful because it caught this
36:14 - obviously this isn't an error that would
36:16 - have caused our app to crash
36:18 - but we still would would rather not push
36:20 - that
36:22 - so we're just going to go up to the top
36:24 - here
36:25 - and see this event section
36:27 - we i took that out because that was not
36:30 - needed
36:31 - for this particular page
36:33 - um but i forgot to take out the import
36:36 - so if i go back in i just press the up
36:38 - arrow key
36:40 - it brings my message right back up my my
36:42 - last command i can hit enter again and
36:45 - we'll redo that
36:46 - hopefully we're good now yay all right
36:49 - awesome
36:50 - so everything worked it told me i need
36:52 - to upgrade but other than that
36:54 - everything worked and now we're just
36:56 - going to do a get push
36:58 - origin
36:59 - upgrade
37:01 - right because i want to push this to the
37:02 - upgrade branch
37:09 - and
37:10 - there we go everything's there let's
37:13 - double check that and i'll show you how
37:15 - to get to it
37:18 - let me
37:20 - make this a bit bigger and increase the
37:22 - font size
37:24 - so
37:26 - i can get to it easily because it's one
37:28 - of my repositories here but
37:30 - if we go to fus
37:33 - fus-marcon
37:35 - is fps hyphen marcom is the organization
37:37 - and the project is ci hyphen react we go
37:40 - down here right now we're on the master
37:42 - branch and you see there's not very many
37:44 - updates because we've been doing all the
37:46 - latest updates on the upgrade branch
37:50 - so we just click that drop down
37:53 - go to upgrade and see now we have some
37:55 - updates that are a minute ago those are
37:57 - what we just
37:58 - we just did
38:00 - right so you can go into where we're at
38:02 - pages mentor training and here you can
38:05 - see everything that we just went over
38:09 - so i know a lot of you are really
38:10 - familiar with this and you don't you
38:12 - don't need the explanation but we do
38:14 - have
38:14 - some people who are are very new to
38:16 - coding and some people that don't really
38:18 - know anything at all about coding that
38:20 - watch
38:21 - um so this kind of explanation
38:24 - i think is is helpful
38:25 - uh hopefully you know some of you are
38:27 - new you don't have to say you're new i
38:29 - don't if you're going to be embarrassed
38:30 - by admitting that uh you know you're you
38:33 - don't know anything about github or
38:34 - something like that
38:36 - i don't think you have to be embarrassed
38:37 - but i totally understand if you don't
38:38 - want to say it
38:41 - but hopefully that helps you all i know
38:43 - it adds a little bit of time to the
38:44 - stream but i want to be
38:47 - as beginner friendly
38:49 - as i possibly can
38:51 - all right so
38:54 - at this point
38:56 - i need a drink
39:07 - and at this point since we're already on
39:08 - github i'd like to show you all some of
39:10 - the pull requests that
39:12 - were made and um
39:15 - and thank everyone that submitted pull
39:17 - requests and i'm just gonna kind of go
39:19 - over what's what's changed
39:21 - and it looks like i have a message here
39:24 - about the side menu let's check it out
39:29 - all right cool so uh
39:31 - angel is is working on that
39:34 - react native
39:36 - app that we're making so we're taking
39:38 - the resource center which we already
39:40 - made in react and we're just converting
39:42 - it to be able to work in react native so
39:45 - if you're not familiar with react native
39:47 - that means that we'll be able to run the
39:50 - resource center on android and ios as a
39:53 - native
39:54 - mobile application which is going to be
39:56 - awesome it's going to solve some browser
39:58 - issue problems that we've had
40:01 - i did read an interesting
40:03 - uh article recently
40:05 - and i i forget where i saw it so
40:08 - otherwise i'd let you know where it's at
40:10 - but it was basically making the argument
40:12 - that if we really care about our users
40:14 - we won't support older browsers
40:16 - because older browsers are not secure so
40:19 - by supporting older browsers we're
40:21 - enabling that behavior
40:23 - and we're actually contributing to our
40:25 - users being at risk
40:28 - like if if we handle sensitive data and
40:30 - we allow people in an old browser to
40:33 - actually make transactions on our site
40:34 - let's say it's an e-commerce site then
40:37 - we're
40:38 - allowing them to put their data at risk
40:40 - they probably don't even realize it so
40:42 - the the i think the title of the article
40:44 - was
40:45 - by supporting older browsers are we
40:48 - really like caring for do we really care
40:51 - about our users or do we care about our
40:52 - business right so from a business
40:55 - perspective you want everybody to be
40:57 - able to buy something no matter what
40:59 - browser they're on
41:00 - but if we're really caring about the
41:01 - users wouldn't we want to
41:04 - stop them from potentially leaking their
41:07 - data out
41:08 - from an old browser so
41:11 - that that's kind of changed the way i
41:13 - thought about things
41:15 - i still like to support browsers to an
41:17 - extent
41:19 - but i've kind of felt the the same way
41:22 - in in terms of supporting really old
41:24 - browsers is are we really
41:27 - doing anybody a favor
41:29 - by supporting older browsers so anyway
41:32 - i just it reminded me of that because
41:34 - we've had issues with the resource
41:35 - center not working with older browsers
41:37 - and
41:38 - i've i've tried to accommodate the older
41:40 - browsers but i'm not sure that that's
41:42 - that's the right move
41:46 - anyway
41:47 - if you all want to weigh in on that uh
41:50 - please do i'm interested to
41:52 - see you know what what you all think
41:54 - about that uh so basically
41:58 - from from the perspective of how we can
42:00 - best care for our users
42:04 - is it better to support older browsers
42:06 - or not support older browsers
42:11 - all right cool
42:13 - let's go to
42:16 - our repo here and most of the changes
42:21 - uh i'm sorry the pull requests that were
42:23 - merged in were for this franciscan react
42:25 - but we did have some for this react
42:27 - native so we'll look at that as well
42:30 - so i'm going to go into the pool
42:31 - requests
42:33 - and the ones that are closed and just
42:35 - check out the first few
42:37 - so
42:39 - i don't think i ever gave credit to
42:40 - angel for this one but
42:42 - this was a while ago
42:44 - last week fixed that center logo uh
42:48 - centered the logo on the sidebar which
42:49 - is awesome
42:51 - uh
42:52 - i know also updated material ui to the
42:54 - latest version so we were on
42:57 - [Music]
42:58 - 26.26
43:00 - and
43:01 - we're now we're now on the latest
43:03 - version which is 0.28
43:05 - so that's awesome
43:07 - evidently there were no breaking changes
43:09 - because everything still works
43:11 - and
43:13 - let's see
43:14 - we also have let's look at these
43:18 - look in here these ones so make social
43:21 - icons larger and center them great so
43:23 - for a while i've been bothered by the um
43:27 - social icons being
43:29 - like weirdly off center so now the
43:32 - social icons are bigger
43:35 - so thank you very much
43:37 - and
43:40 - let's see
43:41 - we also have the the text for that
43:44 - donate button is now
43:48 - uh corrected so now it says access fus
43:51 - so thank you for that as well and then
43:54 - we do have a pull request we had kind of
43:56 - a large pull request here
43:58 - and this was from
44:01 - angel as well
44:04 - and
44:06 - you can see basically this added a lot
44:08 - of stuff right uh a header with the
44:11 - green back u background for all the
44:13 - views uh drawer navigation
44:16 - uh if you're not familiar with react
44:18 - native navigation it's not the same as
44:20 - you'd normally navigate in a regular
44:22 - react
44:23 - web app
44:25 - so that's why we're talking about drawer
44:27 - navigation
44:29 - uh think of like being able to click
44:31 - links in a side drawer right on an app
44:34 - that's the kind of navigation we're
44:35 - talking about which
44:38 - like
44:38 - it's like you would expect from the name
44:40 - i suppose i also created the drawer the
44:43 - side menu
44:44 - um
44:47 - added some views added an about view and
44:49 - added an icon to the header so we can
44:51 - actually click to open the drawer
44:53 - so that's awesome you can check out all
44:55 - the changes here you can see quite a few
44:56 - eight files changed
45:00 - really nice a lot of good stuff here
45:04 - so if you want to know more about
45:08 - react native
45:10 - and how we set this up initially go back
45:13 - and check i think we called this project
45:15 - six so go back and check in the the live
45:18 - stream
45:20 - uh playlist and find the one that's
45:22 - project six i think it says react native
45:24 - in the title almost positive i'll have
45:26 - to separate this out into its own
45:28 - playlist at some point
45:30 - but right now we only have one video so
45:32 - i'm not gonna make a playlist with one
45:34 - video in it
45:36 - uh so anyway those are hopefully i
45:38 - didn't miss anything but those are the
45:39 - pull requests that we got and they're
45:41 - really awesome i'm i'm really glad that
45:43 - we have some progress here on this react
45:45 - native thing i don't have any time right
45:48 - now to work on it but i was always
45:50 - hoping that somebody would be interested
45:51 - in getting some practice and would want
45:53 - to want to work on this a bit
45:55 - so
45:57 - really glad about that thank you
46:01 - we also have an electron app if
46:04 - anybody's interested in electron so
46:06 - we're basically
46:08 - using react and electron to make an app
46:10 - that would could run on windows
46:13 - ios or i'm sorry mac os and
46:16 - and linux
46:18 - could run as a desktop app so
46:22 - that's also
46:24 - another project out there
46:26 - it just depends
46:28 - um
46:30 - depends on
46:32 - you know what you're interested in uh so
46:34 - if it's something you're you're into
46:35 - then you know please by all means go
46:38 - ahead if you know ask me
46:40 - what needs done or i can help walk you
46:42 - through things just let me know
46:45 - uh
46:48 - harsh it says show contributors data i
46:50 - wonder what's happened
46:53 - all right let me go to contributors
46:56 - you have three contributors
47:01 - our
47:03 - or you're still number one on this still
47:06 - number one
47:09 - cool and i guess we can show
47:10 - contributors data for
47:12 - our franciscan react as well
47:16 - i haven't shown that for a while i do
47:17 - like to show the contributors data to
47:19 - give you all credit
47:21 - so
47:22 - hey i'm actually the top contributor on
47:24 - my own project this time
47:27 - that's good
47:28 - um
47:29 - we got hardship close behind
47:32 - so
47:33 - i'll zoom in on everybody so y'all can
47:35 - see thank you everyone who contributed i
47:38 - really appreciate it
47:42 - okay
47:43 - i'm gonna go to the live chat now and
47:45 - i'm gonna answer as many questions as i
47:47 - can if you had any questions about
47:49 - anything that we've worked on it doesn't
47:50 - have to be a topic that we've covered
47:53 - already in the stream it could be any of
47:55 - the repos we're working on or just any
47:56 - question in general i'll answer pretty
47:58 - much anything
48:00 - uh as long as
48:03 - i mean i'll pretty much answer anything
48:06 - it'll be really obvious if something's
48:07 - not an appropriate question and i'll
48:08 - just skip that but otherwise i'm i'm
48:12 - i'm open
48:13 - so
48:15 - i'm scrolling way back up to the top
48:18 - sorry i had a missed call i think it was
48:20 - spam though just wanted to check
48:36 - um
48:39 - all right
48:41 - i just got a really surprising message
48:43 - from my wife
48:45 - wow
48:46 - it's nothing bad with my marriage or
48:48 - anything like that it's just somebody
48:49 - that we both know something crazy
48:51 - happened
48:56 - okay
48:58 - sorry i keep taking drinks if you
49:00 - weren't here at the beginning i have a
49:01 - sore throat so i'm just trying to keep
49:03 - myself from coughing and drinking helps
49:07 - um
49:09 - let's see
49:18 - all right so uh acrom says which
49:21 - javascript framework can i start
49:23 - learning
49:24 - um you could start learning any of them
49:27 - that you really want to
49:28 - if you'd like to be able to follow along
49:30 - with these streams i recommend learning
49:32 - react
49:33 - because
49:35 - that's what we use mostly
49:38 - if you're if you're really really new to
49:40 - javascript i recommend
49:42 - learning a little bit more javascript
49:44 - before you get into a framework you
49:46 - don't need to be in javascript expert
49:48 - but sometimes it's really hard to
49:51 - understand a framework if you don't have
49:52 - a basic knowledge of javascript so i'm
49:54 - not sure where you're at i don't mean to
49:56 - imply that that you don't know
49:58 - javascript but i i don't really know
50:00 - how much you know so
50:03 - uh if you're solid in your javascript
50:05 - like i said i recommend react
50:08 - but it depends on your goal
50:10 - if you have a company that you really
50:12 - want to get into that uses angular go
50:15 - with that
50:16 - uh if
50:18 - check out vue a lot of people like vue
50:21 - i mean there's still there are companies
50:22 - that use
50:24 - amber uh there's a lot of stuff out
50:26 - there so but i would say the top ones
50:29 - right now you're
50:31 - angular and reacts
50:33 - by far they're the top ones views
50:35 - getting a lot of more people using it
50:37 - but it's so it has momentum but it's not
50:40 - up
50:41 - to the level of uh angular and react i
50:44 - mean in terms of like total users and
50:46 - people people doing things with it
50:50 - uh hopefully that answered your question
50:52 - let me know if you have any follow-ups
50:54 - to that
50:55 - uh dave says thanks for the work you put
50:58 - into this it has really helped me a lot
51:00 - oh you're welcome you're welcome thank
51:02 - you for uh telling me and let me know if
51:05 - there's anything i could do to make the
51:06 - streams better
51:08 - and
51:08 - more if you have any questions and that
51:10 - that's not just for dave that goes for
51:12 - for anyone
51:14 - if i'm doing something that you find
51:16 - really annoying or you think that you
51:18 - have a good idea for something i could
51:20 - do please let me know i can't guarantee
51:22 - that i'll change things based on that
51:25 - but i'll definitely take it into
51:26 - consideration
51:28 - and because i know i mean sometimes my
51:29 - videos get thumbs down
51:31 - i don't care if they get thumbs down
51:34 - it doesn't really make me cry or
51:35 - anything
51:36 - but
51:37 - what i really would like
51:39 - is give the thumbs down and then put
51:41 - something in the description that says
51:43 - here's why i gave you the thumbs down
51:45 - that way i can make things better
51:48 - uh
51:50 - all right
51:51 - that's always like on stack overflow you
51:54 - can downvote somebody's answer if i get
51:56 - a down vote and nobody tells me why i
51:58 - get a down vote i'm like
52:01 - well how am i supposed to give you a
52:02 - better answer next time i have no idea
52:05 - why you downvoted it
52:07 - i obviously thought it was a good answer
52:08 - i wouldn't have posted it right
52:10 - so
52:11 - anyway i'm
52:13 - the point is i'm trying to make is that
52:15 - i i welcome criticism in your ideas i do
52:18 - want to make this stream better and more
52:20 - helpful to you all
52:23 - uh nissar says jesse would you like to
52:25 - see your future
52:28 - full project with react native
52:30 - compatible uh with expo
52:33 - uh just pure
52:35 - javascript
52:37 - here's your full project with rec native
52:38 - compatible with expo
52:42 - just javascript
52:44 - i'm not exactly sure
52:46 - everything is going on in that question
52:48 - um but if i'd like to see my future full
52:51 - project with react
52:53 - native
52:54 - that would be cool
52:56 - that would actually be really cool i
52:58 - don't think that that's something that
53:00 - my boss even has on his mind at all
53:03 - about doing the university does
53:05 - currently have an app
53:07 - i had nothing to do with with the
53:09 - building of that app we hired another
53:11 - company to do it
53:12 - so
53:14 - um
53:16 - i think right now he's worried about
53:18 - just trying to work within that app
53:20 - structure
53:22 - he's not opposed to me having other apps
53:24 - though i've talked to him about for
53:26 - instance the resource center being a
53:28 - mobile app
53:30 - so
53:30 - i for sure want this website to be a
53:33 - progressive web app so i want people to
53:35 - be able to
53:37 - you know download the
53:38 - the shortcut you know on their phone
53:41 - be able to use it offline
53:43 - to a certain extent
53:46 - but if we can turn it into an app
53:49 - i'm cool with that as well
53:52 - uh
54:04 - ah i'm trying to remember how to spell
54:06 - that or how to pronounce that sorry
54:09 - uh duvoprio
54:10 - says uh
54:12 - no one replies like you do the way you
54:14 - help us with our personal projects and
54:17 - open a new tab for searching about our
54:18 - problems or us is really exceptional oh
54:22 - thanks for saying that i don't i mean
54:26 - i don't know honestly
54:27 - some of it
54:28 - i i like don't have a lot of people
54:31 - following me
54:32 - and i have the luxury being able to do
54:34 - this from work so
54:36 - a lot of the other youtube people or you
54:39 - know just people on twitter instagram or
54:41 - whatever
54:42 - sometimes they have a lot of followers
54:46 - you know i mean i have maybe
54:50 - i don't know my twitter is like almost
54:52 - 800 followers right there are people on
54:54 - there that have over 100 000
54:56 - right so i have a tiny fraction of what
54:58 - they have so i'm not getting swamped in
55:00 - my dms by people so i definitely have
55:03 - the freedom and the fact that i can do
55:05 - this at work as part of my work and get
55:08 - paid for it kind of frees me up a little
55:10 - bit as well so
55:12 - having said that i mean i do really like
55:14 - to take the time to answer everybody uh
55:16 - the way i see it
55:18 - is i don't want to be the person that
55:21 - discourages somebody else and they don't
55:24 - go into coding i'd rather be the person
55:26 - that i'll never know it but maybe
55:28 - somebody was just on the brink of giving
55:30 - up and i say one encouraging thing and
55:34 - you know then they go forward
55:36 - right
55:37 - i'll probably never know about it but
55:39 - that's really
55:40 - at that point i could either say
55:42 - something encouraging or i could you
55:45 - know say nothing or
55:47 - say something you know derogatory
55:49 - towards them and then they they quit so
55:51 - i don't know that's how i think when i
55:53 - do stuff like this and when i try to
55:55 - answer and i'm not always the best i
55:57 - know there have been people who've asked
55:59 - me to like review their portfolio resume
56:02 - and
56:03 - i never really got back to them
56:05 - if that has happened to you
56:07 - please like send me a message and remind
56:09 - me because sometimes things just get
56:11 - really really busy with my work and my
56:13 - family and it just slips through so
56:16 - i don't want to pretend like i'm perfect
56:18 - when it comes to answering but i do try
56:20 - my best
56:21 - and uh but you know give the other
56:23 - people a break as well because i'm sure
56:25 - they have a lot more
56:27 - going on than i do
56:29 - and especially
56:31 - i don't want to go on too much of a
56:32 - tangent but i i would kind of like to
56:34 - mention this
56:36 - uh because i notice
56:39 - some of the
56:40 - female coders that i follow on twitter
56:44 - and on instagram they mention sometimes
56:46 - that
56:47 - they get a lot of direct messages from
56:49 - people um
56:51 - and
56:52 - sometimes they get inappropriate things
56:54 - message to them or
56:56 - you know so it's just hard like i don't
56:59 - get that
57:00 - you know i've never experienced that as
57:02 - as a male developer
57:04 - when people watch my stuff they they
57:07 - always talk about my code for the most
57:09 - part i mean occasionally somebody makes
57:10 - a comment on whether i shave my beard or
57:12 - not right but
57:14 - uh as a female developer
57:16 - a lot of the comments have to do with
57:19 - their appearance
57:20 - and it's like people just ignore their
57:22 - coding abilities so
57:25 - i just be careful about that and you
57:28 - know give them a break too if you're
57:30 - trying to ask them a question and that
57:32 - you know they have to deal with a lot
57:34 - more than i have to deal with
57:37 - and they've probably had some really bad
57:39 - experiences before so there may be a lot
57:42 - more you know careful so
57:44 - just be straightforward and
57:46 - you know if you send them a direct
57:48 - message don't just say hey what's up
57:51 - because they're probably gonna ignore it
57:53 - right because they probably get a
57:54 - million of those and then when they do
57:55 - answer it ends up being somebody who's
57:58 - you know not very nice to them
58:00 - so
58:00 - you know maybe say say something like
58:03 - hey
58:04 - uh you look like you really know what
58:06 - you're doing in coding i'm having this
58:08 - problem you know could you please answer
58:10 - my question
58:12 - right
58:13 - um
58:14 - you know don't start out with like
58:17 - you know the heart emojis and the heart
58:19 - eyes and saying you're so beautiful um
58:23 - and you're a good coder like
58:25 - now i mean i'm sure that's flattering
58:27 - sometimes but you know if you get that
58:29 - 500 times a day
58:32 - maybe it gets old i don't know
58:35 - if you all want to tell me how beautiful
58:36 - i am you know you i'm i'm open to that
58:39 - that would be fun but
58:43 - anyway all right that's my
58:45 - uh
58:46 - that's my message for the day
58:48 - is uh basically in general be nice to
58:51 - everybody when you do comments but
58:53 - especially um
58:55 - you know just kind of be aware of what
58:58 - some other uh coders
59:00 - on social media and on youtube have to
59:03 - deal with
59:07 - okay let me get back to the live chat
59:24 - oh harsh it said i'm late did i miss
59:26 - something um harsha you probably were
59:30 - able to catch up so let me know
59:32 - if you didn't and i'll
59:34 - i'll try to catch you up on things but
59:37 - you didn't really miss that much and
59:39 - you're super smart so i'm sure you
59:40 - caught up harsh it also says materialize
59:43 - eliminated jquery in version one
59:47 - i'll have to check that out because when
59:48 - we use materialize for this they still
59:50 - were dependent on jquery
59:53 - but
59:54 - i'm i'm actually really interested if
59:56 - that's the case
59:58 - that's really interesting i'll have to
60:00 - check it out i haven't looked at any of
60:02 - the updates for materialize in a while
60:04 - since we started using material ui for
60:06 - most of our our stuff
60:09 - uh oh
60:10 - uh i'm sorry i'm probably not gonna
60:12 - pronounce this right ogusan
60:16 - says what's the best ide
60:19 - uh
60:20 - i'm i'm currently using well if you want
60:23 - to consider visual studio code in ide
60:26 - which some people do some people don't
60:28 - but if you do want to consider an ide i
60:30 - really like visual studio code
60:32 - i've used atom before and i do like atom
60:35 - as well
60:36 - and
60:37 - you know so
60:39 - i think there's a lot of ids out there
60:41 - that are really close in terms of
60:43 - you know their functionality
60:46 - but right now i'm very happy with visual
60:48 - studio code
60:53 - harshit says so you switch to outlook
60:54 - how's it working
60:56 - i really like outlook is a huge
60:58 - improvement over what we did have before
61:00 - so you know for my personal stuff i use
61:02 - gmail but for work i use outlook
61:05 - and
61:08 - i love it we were using novell groupwise
61:10 - before which is really ancient and
61:13 - and terrible
61:15 - i'm sorry if you work at nobel group
61:17 - wise
61:19 - i'm sure you do hard work and you're
61:21 - good at your job
61:23 - but i'm sure you've also inherited a lot
61:25 - of legacy stuff and it's hard to work
61:26 - with so
61:27 - uh if you are working on that like keep
61:30 - working
61:31 - uh and do your best but
61:33 - i just can't in good conscience
61:35 - recommend it to anybody
61:37 - [Music]
61:38 - their their mobile capabilities were
61:40 - pretty much non-existent if you're
61:41 - trying to go through your browser
61:44 - and um
61:46 - yeah it was just
61:48 - not fun to work with
61:50 - so far i really like outlook i really
61:52 - love the outlook app as well
61:54 - and i'm gonna give a shout out to
61:56 - uh marie clemency
61:58 - who works on the outlook app and i was i
62:01 - met her at november so i'm sure she's
62:03 - not watching but anyway if anybody knows
62:06 - marie or
62:07 - ever meets her she she's done a great
62:09 - job with the outlook app i'm really
62:11 - impressed
62:20 - uh tobe says
62:23 - love the beard thanks
62:26 - uh i had a poll on instagram yesterday
62:28 - about whether or not i should shave my
62:30 - beard and
62:31 - uh the the overwhelming majority said i
62:33 - should keep it
62:35 - so it's going to stay for a little while
62:37 - which is good because it's really cold
62:39 - outside
62:40 - but anyways as you sound a bit cold make
62:42 - sure you take those d vitamins
62:44 - i do need to take d vitamins i get no
62:46 - sunlight
62:48 - um and i am i have i don't know what i
62:50 - have a cold or something
62:54 - i don't know i feel i'm trying my best
62:56 - to just ignore it and pretend like i'm
62:58 - not sick but
62:59 - i'm so tired
63:03 - uh let's see harshit says
63:05 - that plus minus things is simple math
63:08 - kind of distance formula
63:10 - as far as it says difference of
63:12 - coordinates harsh it's typing in some
63:14 - math in here
63:15 - and uh
63:18 - harsha
63:19 - you're better at math than me because
63:21 - i'm like
63:25 - not even following it at this point
63:29 - the last math course i took was so long
63:31 - ago
63:34 - uh
63:39 - let's see harshad says you have not
63:40 - calculated the whole distance
63:48 - oh shoot it skipped down to the bottom
63:50 - sorry i gotta scroll back up
63:52 - uh you have not calculated the whole
63:53 - distance but
63:55 - that value works for comparison for
63:58 - complete accuracy i would have made the
64:00 - api called a google uh distance matrix
64:02 - api
64:04 - uh this gives distance by car plane bike
64:06 - etc yeah yeah like like i said i was
64:08 - thinking we'd have to go to an api but
64:11 - then i realized that we don't really
64:13 - need precise distance this is just
64:16 - in general also the the problem was as
64:18 - well is a lot of times the
64:21 - the
64:22 - woman who's in charge of doing entering
64:24 - the data doesn't really even know the
64:26 - exact location
64:28 - of these events she just knows the city
64:32 - so
64:33 - having more precise
64:35 - data wouldn't even be that helpful
64:39 - so anyway
64:40 - that's but that's good to point out
64:42 - though harsha so when we went over how i
64:44 - did the comparison of locations
64:47 - to tell which
64:49 - was farther away which was closer
64:52 - that was just a very general way to do
64:54 - it because for our use case that was
64:57 - sufficient
64:58 - if you wanted like people to actually
65:00 - have you know a really precise
65:03 - location you would want to use something
65:05 - like
65:06 - you know make an api to google
65:09 - and get to the
65:11 - more precise directions
65:14 - let's see
65:16 - coding in caffeine says i need coffee
65:21 - and yeah i could probably do with
65:23 - another cup of coffee i had like a half
65:25 - a cup of coffee earlier
65:28 - and it was what was left over from
65:29 - yesterday and i just heated it up
65:33 - uh
65:34 - let's see
65:35 - uh gander7 said
65:37 - okay so this is in response to when i
65:40 - was talking about browsers and whether
65:42 - or not it's a good idea to support older
65:44 - browsers particularly when you're
65:46 - thinking of what's the best thing for
65:48 - the user
65:50 - to
65:51 - support the browsers or not and to try
65:53 - to encourage them to upgrade their
65:54 - browsers so gander 7 says agreed we only
65:57 - support current browsers it is possible
66:00 - to
66:01 - let's see
66:02 - all right the next q the next statement
66:04 - doesn't have to do with that but yeah
66:06 - i'm starting to think like that as well
66:08 - that
66:09 - i should only support newer browsers but
66:13 - make have an easy way to explain to
66:16 - users and that they need to upgrade and
66:18 - then have links available for them to
66:20 - upgrade
66:23 - uh gander 7 also says
66:25 - is it possible to create an electron app
66:28 - that is self-contained
66:30 - load urls uh loads load file um and
66:34 - handle react js versus load a server
66:38 - localhost i've been trying to find
66:41 - i've been trying but can't find a way
66:45 - um
66:48 - i'm i'm not really sure
66:50 - so i i have never successfully made an
66:54 - electron react app yet we just got one
66:56 - started so
66:58 - we we basically have like a hello world
67:00 - app running and it works but
67:03 - you know that's that's not really like i
67:05 - mean
67:06 - i made an app so
67:08 - i don't really know
67:10 - um but if you want to follow along with
67:12 - our project
67:14 - i can't tell you for sure when i'm gonna
67:16 - have
67:17 - time to work on it
67:20 - uh but maybe you know in the process of
67:22 - that you know we'll have to answer that
67:24 - question
67:26 - john hanson's here uh says hi all late i
67:29 - was eating yeah no problem
67:39 - um
67:41 - harsh it says i'm i'm busy nowadays i'm
67:43 - not able to contribute yeah i totally
67:45 - understand you told me school started
67:47 - and everything so
67:48 - you've contributed so much hardship i
67:50 - really appreciate it so don't
67:52 - don't worry i don't know if you're
67:54 - worrying about it hopefully not because
67:56 - you don't need to worry at all you've
67:57 - done so much
67:58 - and i
68:00 - i do i appreciate that and everybody
68:02 - here in my department appreciates it i
68:05 - told them at meetings how much work you
68:07 - have done so they they all know that
68:09 - you've done
68:10 - uh you know really good work
68:13 - and uh i even told them i said arshad's
68:16 - better than me he does great work
68:18 - like it's he's he's awesome so
68:22 - you do what you have to do for school
68:24 - and don't worry about this
68:27 - uh john says
68:30 - different skins hard to do on page x
68:33 - page y or client x client y on different
68:36 - screens and devices
68:40 - okay i'm not sure it was that was that
68:42 - was directed to harshit for something
68:44 - um
68:48 - oh cool harshit says check out ant
68:50 - design it's like material design but
68:52 - they made it completely for react
68:54 - all right cool uh it's it dot design
68:59 - let me i'm gonna type it in on my other
69:00 - screen here so don't forget
69:13 - all right just scrolling through their
69:14 - website their website looks good so
69:16 - that's that's uh
69:20 - good sign right off the bat got a lot of
69:21 - stars on github very cool i'll check
69:24 - that out later thanks uh thanks for the
69:26 - the lane carson
69:32 - uh s shravan says
69:35 - how to differentiate between
69:38 - um
69:39 - admin and user in authentication please
69:43 - help me to get the knowledge i'm using
69:45 - react
69:46 - uh all right i'll definitely need some
69:49 - more info for that
69:50 - uh but i'm happy to help if i can
69:55 - um a harsh respondent said are you using
69:58 - uh json web tokens or cookies
70:06 - let's see
70:16 - okay so stravan is using json web tokens
70:19 - and firebase
70:25 - all right it looks like harshit is is
70:27 - offering some advice on that so
70:29 - i'm going to defer to harshi because i
70:31 - know
70:32 - he's more experienced with that kind of
70:33 - stuff
70:34 - and uh harsh is coming from back end and
70:37 - moving into front end stuff as well
70:40 - so
70:41 - that's something that
70:43 - he's going to be way more familiar with
70:45 - i'm coming from front end and learning
70:46 - more about back end and using it
70:50 - uh let's see
70:52 - i lost my place here
70:54 - harshad said do you know oh sorry john
70:57 - hanson says
70:58 - for some odd reason learning pug for
71:00 - html taught me a lot when it came to
71:02 - learning javascript that's cool
71:05 - that's cool i um
71:07 - back when pug was called jade i did some
71:09 - stuff with it but i have not used it for
71:12 - a really long time
71:14 - at least a year or more
71:17 - harsha says do you know it cost points
71:19 - to download and stack overflow i didn't
71:21 - realize i don't think i've ever
71:22 - downloaded anything in stack overflow
71:26 - usually if there's a terrible answer
71:28 - it's already been downloaded or
71:29 - downloaded so many times it's like why
71:31 - even bother
71:38 - gander 7 says you got one more on
71:40 - twitter now awesome thanks
71:44 - thanks yeah if uh if you do follow me on
71:47 - twitter i do tweet about
71:49 - when i'm gonna stream and what i'm gonna

71:54 - watch a stream on a particular day
71:57 - and i also will retweet like if you
71:59 - tweet and say you're looking for a job

72:08 - tweet so i definitely see it you know go
72:10 - ahead and do that and
72:12 - you know i'm more than happy like i said
72:14 - i don't have that many people following
72:15 - me
72:16 - but i can get you some exposure you know
72:18 - maybe you can get some more retweets
72:20 - from other people that have a bigger
72:22 - following
72:24 - so
72:25 - i can't really do much more than that
72:26 - but i'll do what i can for you
72:29 - oh harsha completed the the new westboss
72:32 - grid course that's awesome that just
72:34 - came out like yesterday right good job
72:36 - on that
72:37 - uh he said it was very good so that's
72:40 - really cool so if you want to learn more
72:41 - about css grid check out the new course
72:44 - from westboss it's css grid dot io
72:47 - it's completely free
72:49 - so
72:51 - go ahead and check that out i definitely
72:52 - want to check it out i just have a lot
72:54 - going on right now so i don't know if
72:55 - i'm going to be able to but
72:58 - at some point i do want to check that
73:00 - out
73:07 - uh olsa says
73:09 - it's good to see real life project
73:12 - working uh process i'm still new in web
73:15 - development so touching everything here
73:19 - and there so just wanted to say thank
73:21 - you for your streams it helps and
73:22 - motivates oh you're welcome
73:25 - you're welcome comments like that help
73:26 - and motivate me so i'm glad
73:29 - i'm glad you said that and i'm glad that
73:31 - my stream is is helping you out
73:35 - uh pollux says
73:37 - where to learn best practices about
73:39 - react in javascript
73:41 - um
73:42 - really the the react documentation is a
73:45 - good place to to go
73:48 - um
73:49 - i think with javascript best practices
73:55 - i mean
73:56 - mdn mozilla developer network is good if
73:59 - you want to learn about specific parts
74:01 - of javascript
74:03 - otherwise i mean maybe a book series
74:05 - like
74:07 - like you don't know js is free online
74:09 - eloquent javascript is a free book
74:13 - online and you can buy the paper version
74:15 - of it as well
74:17 - but those are good places to learn more
74:19 - about javascript
74:23 - you could check out some javascript
74:24 - style guides from big companies like
74:26 - airbnb has a very popular style guide
74:29 - for javascript standard js has one
74:33 - those can help i mean
74:34 - in terms of like how should you properly
74:37 - format and do things
74:39 - if anyone else has any suggestions on
74:41 - that please put it in the in the live
74:43 - chat
74:47 - michael says hey oh it's been a while
74:49 - hey michael how's it going thanks for
74:51 - joining
74:54 - let's see
75:03 - harsh is still trying to help stravon
75:05 - with his um authentication
75:07 - uh questions and one of josh's responses
75:11 - was it's easy i can show you how
75:15 - harsh it makes everything look easy some
75:17 - of the things that that you can do are
75:20 - probably easy to you but not not to me
75:23 - so
75:24 - so just remember that if harsha tells
75:26 - you something's easy it may not actually
75:29 - be easy
75:41 - david says vitamins are a scam
75:45 - even if the vitamins are just a placebo
75:47 - effect for me i'll take it at this point
75:50 - i don't really care
75:52 - because i just i i want to not be sick
75:55 - and have more energy
76:09 - oh okay harsha said school hasn't
76:10 - started yet it'll start on 13th of
76:12 - february
76:16 - let's see
76:24 - okay john says uh the google maps api
76:27 - has a way to put directions from the
76:29 - visitors location it's fairly simple to
76:31 - implement on a website
76:33 - it's
76:34 - to put it in a react app is a bit more
76:36 - tricky
76:38 - all right that's really cool like i said
76:39 - for this app i don't think it's
76:41 - necessary
76:42 - but that's good to know i it would
76:44 - actually be really cool to do that in
76:46 - some of the other stuff that i've been
76:48 - working on
76:49 - uh some like previous sites i i have a
76:52 - previous site that's not a react app
76:55 - where that could be really useful i
76:56 - think so
76:58 - when i have time at some point maybe
77:00 - we'll add that in
77:05 - divo says hi hey evo how's it going
77:08 - thanks for joining
77:20 - george asks if there's any firebase
77:22 - projects coming in the future
77:24 - i can't say for sure i i'd love to work
77:26 - with firebase i've learned a little bit
77:28 - about it and heard other people uh
77:31 - use it and heard them talk about it so i
77:34 - i'm really interested
77:35 - but i have to find some way to work it
77:37 - into a project
77:39 - and if i can i'll work with it but like
77:42 - i said i can't can't guarantee anything
77:45 - uh
77:47 - let's see sorry i don't know exactly how
77:50 - to pronounce this name it's b-e-r-k-e so
77:52 - beric berka
77:54 - um says can you
77:56 - suggest a source to learn react for
77:58 - beginners
78:01 - check out the tutorial
78:03 - from the actual react website that's a
78:06 - good place to start code academy has a
78:08 - tutorial
78:10 - that would probably be good to go
78:12 - through
78:13 - free code camp their new beta curriculum
78:15 - has some react stuff in there i haven't
78:17 - tried it yet
78:19 - but usually the free code camp stuff is
78:21 - pretty good
78:22 - uh so those places i think are a good
78:24 - place to start
78:43 - um john says jen simmons has started a
78:46 - new youtube channel called layout and
78:48 - layout land she knows css grid like no
78:51 - one else all right really cool i'll have
78:53 - to check that out uh thanks for that
78:55 - john
78:58 - well harshit said she wrote it spec wow
79:01 - that's
79:02 - i would say she knows it
79:04 - she wrote the spec that's really cool
79:08 - harsha said she even kind of corrected
79:10 - westboss for making imperfect
79:13 - advice on the grid on twitter wow
79:17 - all right maybe i have to check out that
79:19 - youtube channel then
79:21 - i like youtube videos for code stuff
79:23 - because like when i'm eating
79:26 - i usually just eat in my office at my
79:27 - desk and i watch a video um some type of
79:31 - coding tutorial or something
79:34 - so i'm always looking for for
79:36 - new videos and useful things
79:40 - evo says doing pretty good sign my
79:42 - contract today with which i can start
79:43 - working next monday awesome
79:46 - awesome congratulations uh i understand
79:49 - you'll probably be pretty busy but
79:52 - if you could remember let me know like
79:55 - how your first day goes your first week
79:57 - or whatever i'm i'm really interested in
79:59 - that so
80:00 - uh so don't forget about us when you're
80:03 - you know busy
80:04 - uh building cool things and making lots
80:06 - of money
80:11 - all right well i've gotten to the bottom
80:13 - of the live chat
80:15 - and
80:17 - i think i'm gonna wrap things up now
80:20 - i can't believe i've been streaming for
80:21 - almost an hour and a half
80:23 - uh
80:27 - okay
80:28 - now's a great time to end it's friday so
80:31 - we're gonna have the weekend i'll be
80:32 - back most likely on monday
80:34 - there is um a storm that's gonna come
80:38 - through
80:38 - maybe sometime next week so
80:42 - if it storms really bad and i can't make
80:44 - it into work probably won't have a
80:46 - stream
80:47 - so just be aware that there may be some
80:49 - days when i can't stream next week just
80:50 - depending on what happens with the
80:52 - weather
80:53 - otherwise i'm planning on streaming
80:55 - every day if i can
80:59 - um
81:05 - let's see
81:08 - uh one more comment i'll read this out
81:10 - evo says about the video watching and
81:11 - coding one thing i noticed is that
81:13 - non-programmers find it weird that we
81:15 - really enjoy learning more about our
81:17 - expertise
81:18 - oh that's interesting
81:20 - that is true you know coders seem like
81:22 - we love what we're doing like we watch
81:24 - stuff we go home and think about code we
81:26 - may have side projects like
81:29 - yeah i mean i guess you don't see that
81:31 - in every
81:32 - um
81:33 - every profession
81:35 - but that's cool we're passionate about
81:36 - what we do we really like it i think
81:38 - it's a good thing as long as you don't
81:40 - overdo it you know ignore your family or
81:42 - your health or anything like that but
81:44 - um anyway that's a good observation evo
81:50 - all right so
81:51 - have a wonderful weekend everyone thank
81:53 - you so much for watching and for all
81:55 - your help in the live chat
81:57 - i will be back
81:59 - monday
82:01 - see ya

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to work on an old project and i i already started working on it and it ended up being a lot easier than i thought so i've already finished what i said i was gonna do for this video uh but what i will do is i'll go through everything that i've done and if there's a chance to refactor or improve it in any way we'll do that this would be kind of cool to revisit that that first project that we did just kind of go through the code i know you know some of you were involved in that first project but you know a lot of you watching probably weren't so some of this will be new to you and i don't know i always think it's kind of fun to go back and look at old projects and and this is a project we were working on at least six months ago maybe probably more so it'll be cool to see how long how far we've come you know hopefully i've i've improved since then so it'll be fun and that's cool this would be kind of more laid back uh my my throat's just after yesterday's stream uh my voice sounded all you know messed up so maybe it's better that this is laid back uh i just want to start out too by showing you something i got today so i work at a university right so i got a knock on the door which is weird because nobody comes to my office but it was a student and who i don't know and they had some some stuff and they're gonna give me this card so i got a a thank you card and i'm gonna cover up the phone number here in case but i got this thank you card from a student here you kind of see it says dear jesse at the top but um i just kind of wanted to share this is a student that i i kind of mentored um last year and he he wasn't a computer science major he was a communications art major but he was taking a web design course and for his project he he wanted to do like a really cool website so i helped him out with he had some parallax stuff going on that was really cool and uh you you all know that i'm partial to parallax um and then he also wanted to grab data using i think i think he ended up using ajax i don't yeah i think he was using ajax uh to grab some data from a google sheet so he had all his data in a spreadsheet so i kind of you know helped him out with that and he'd come into my office and and we'd sit down and and talk about it and check out the code and uh so it was cool but i don't know i just wanted to share it so i'm gonna the card's just really really small so i just kind of want to share uh just as an example of i guess if you take the time to help someone out it can make a big impact on their life it it might not be that big of a deal it might not seem like that big of a deal but it is you know it was a big enough deal for a student to leave me a gift and a card uh you know after everything so it says hey i just wanted to write you a quick thank you for all your help this last semester i honestly couldn't have done it without you so thanks i can see your live stream has been going good i hope you're the next youtube star uh thanks again and please keep in touch um so that was cool i don't know about the youtube star thing but uh i don't know i just felt it felt really cool about that and yeah i mean it took some some hours out of my my day here and there but i don't know who knows the last i heard i haven't talked to him for a while i just sent him a message uh so we'll see if he responds but the last i heard he was developing uh java he's developing software in java uh somewhere out near washington dc so really cool um anyway hey everybody i can see all the everyone in the live chat now um oh rook has to go it's gonna go help a nephew troubleshoot motherboard and graphics card problems oh cool thanks for stopping by to say hi good luck with the the motherboard issues uh the graphics card issues sometimes those can be a pain um let's see kyle uh says been watching replays of your live videos glad to watch you live awesome really glad that you could join live too uh don't be afraid to ask questions make comments on the live chat uh sergio says hey i just want you to know that i like the coding with jessie's series thank you for saying that i really appreciate that comments comments like that make me want to keep doing it um let's see monier says hey guys check out my daily coding life on instagram it's elhrimounir cool i'll um off to check it out i'm gonna copy and paste that right now and uh that way i won't forget i'll check it out check it out later yeah that's a good actually i'm on instagram as well so i do i don't know just some coding stuff from time to time sometimes i just post things from from my life like me with my kids or like food but i do post a lot of coding stuff as well so if you're on instagram and you want to see some of that stuff let me know and if you're doing coding stuff on instagram i'd love to see it so um you know again just let me know i think it'd be i'm trying to follow like as many coders as i can uh on instagram uh it's kind of like twitter has their thing but instagram seems to have this whole different community of coders that kind of do it's like at a different vibe to it so i think it's just kind of cool to see i don't know the differences like twitter seems to be like all about like business you know like let's really talk about the code instagram seems to be more of a mix of here's what i'm doing with the code but then here's kind of how my lifestyle like here's how i handle worklife balance and health and so it i don't know it's kind of cool to see that side of of you know my fellow coders so anyway sorry for the long intro that uh talk but let me go sorry i still have that cough i'm gonna try my best uh i have my g fuel today so g fuel if you're watching hook me up i'll give you shout outs in every video just hook me up with like one tub of pink lemonade flavor i'll give you shout outs for for a whole month um all right we did have a lot of pull requests so after we do the code when i go to answer questions at the end the first part of it i'm going to check the uh the pull request i'm going to check those out and i'm going to give credit where it's due to those of you that submitted some pull requests so i really appreciate that okay cool uh moneer i i did get your uh your friend request on instagram on my phone so i will be following you as soon as i'm done thank you all right so enough of my face let's go to some code so this is our old project and this is the page where i've done the most and it looks like a lot but most of it was copy and paste so that's why i ended up being really easy because i when i first made the video and said i was going to work on this it didn't occur to me that we already had a page that was doing everything that we wanted this new page to do so i had to do a little bit of work in wordpress too i'll go over what i've i've done there and let's see let's turn on the pomodoro clock okay so first things first let me show you what i wanted on the screen i think that's a lot easier to show at first and then go to the code so here's what i wanted a new page called mentor training well when i say i want it i mean the the people that are making the site who are wanted uh we want an intro section which right now it's just uh some bacon ipsum um and then this table if you remember this project this table should look familiar this is the nearby events table we've just changed the name now what i'm not sure about i remember talking about this in a meeting months ago but i wasn't sure if we came to like a conclusion for sure on what these fields should be i vaguely remember basically saying just let me know what field you want and i'll do it and i don't know if i ever got a list so right now they have the same fields here like the same same headers and this data i'm pulling the nearby events data just to give us some sample data because i don't have any real data for these mentor training sessions yet but i did invite the person in charge of content to come edit the wordpress site and and put in some some data so hopefully we'll get some of that soon obviously i'm not going to go live with this until i get the data and contest it if you remember in this project we have a test server on digitalocean and then we have two live servers that we're load balancing between we also have another server where wordpress is running and that's where the data we're getting all the data from uh so you can see with this table it works really well on mobile one of the problems with tables is that often tables don't work actually i changed this and now it goes over so maybe i'll um i'll fix that i'm not sure if we're even going to need that heading anyway but normally you have a table and you try to go it's fine on a large screen but you try to shrink it down and there's like all this table out here and you scroll you have to scroll over and that's not not a good thing you never want to have your users have to scroll horizontally on mobile so that's why we went with this type of table so i didn't come up with everything on this table it's just a modified version of what materialized css had so in this project we're not using material ui like we did in later projects in this project we took materialized css which is not really intended for react but we made it work eventually i'd like to redo this so that we switch everything over to material ui because we have some jquery going on i'd rather not have jquery in here but for now it's it's working so i'm okay with it and on so with materialize the way the table works is by default is when you get a large screen it looks like a normal table with your your headers your headings up at the top and then when you go small to small screen it changes well that didn't exactly work for us we still had a lot of headings so uh just modify it slightly to always be uh in the mobile version and we added in some things like we added in some of these uh icons so you can move back and forth uh otherwise like normally it was just scroll but we've we kind of found it wasn't 100 obvious that you could scroll um we we've also added in some sorting so you can see we can sort by date i believe we can sort we can sort by location as well i think oh you know it's not working because the location data wasn't put in i'll show you where where we need to enter it in it was kind of tricky um to get the right data for that so it actually does assuming you give it permission which i have it will get your location and use it to show you which one is closest and which ones are farther away all right so let's look at the wordpress install right now so basically i made a page called mentor training intro would hat which has the data for that and we'll see where i pull that in and i made a custom post type called mentor trainings you see there's nothing there right now let me zoom in a bit and show you so we have normal we have the date and we have display date this is important because we want we want the date in a format that's easily readable by javascript so that's why we have the date here but then we also want the date displayed in a way that's easily readable by humans so i have two different fields just a little bit more work but it gives us a lot of freedom with how we want to display the date and right now it's uh you know the month in the day comma year um do you have a question about will you upload the video to watch later yes i will i will definitely so if you can't stick around don't worry about it uh i'll answer your questions and i'll upload the video and you can just check in later if you need to um what else we have okay so we have location here and this is just the the location text that will show up to the user so we're usually just doing like city and then state sometimes i guess if you wanted to you could put an actual address here and then down here is where you put in your actual location so we have a map uh yeah this is a google map yes we have a google map you can search for an address and put a pin in there and then it will send the exact coordinates for that location and then that's how we're comparing the coordinates that are given when we turn on the geolocation for the browser we compare that to the coordinates that we're given from that google map for each event and that's how we figure out which ones are closer and which ones are farther away so if you want to know more about how we did that go back and check out some of the the early streams the titles are pretty descriptive on those so you will find some about using geolocation with react okay so now that we have all this let's get to the code so here's the actual components and let me make some space here let me know if this font is too small for you all right so nothing really special here we're bringing you if you're familiar with react we're bringing in react we're bringing in some components here and we're pulling in data so we did make uh use next js to build this so we have access to this git initial props function where we can pull in data and then that data is available to us on the server and the client which is awesome and great for server side rendering um awesome hey just got an email from the content manager for this website that we're working on right now let's see what she said all right so nothing she's just gonna add some stuff later on and also wants to have a rough timeline for all the other updates so i was hoping she'd be ready to put some data in we could actually test it um let's see all right so we're in this get initial props function and we're getting so we're using the wordpress rest api so no graphql and um we have we're sending basically this long string saying what we we need to get so we're using a plugin that lets us get multiple posts and host types in one request so we have multiple post type the tradeoff when you use this plugin is you can't specify a lot of like what you want so we can either get multiple post types and then get everything or we can do one post type and narrow it down and only get certain fields so that was our tradeoff uh we but we needed to get more than one post type so that's we ended up doing it like this so right now i'm bringing in nearby events like i said this will change and we'll actually pull in the mentor training dates and locations but right now we don't have that data we're doing some filtering we're going to order it by by date and ascending and we want some of these fields but then on our second type with our page uh so we can't we can't get like different fields so we can say what fields we want but it's it's not gonna we're not gonna be able to do it for more than one post type so for instance with pages we're getting all the pages i can't specify one specific page so down here i need to when i bring in that that intro section i'm going to do a filter so we're going to this props data so the data we get is stored in props and then we're going to filter the post by the slug which is mentor training intro that means it's going to pull that text in that we had in that we had here right it pulls that text in from wordpress and it displays it here uh also there's supposed to be an image back here i don't know uh what would happen but the image quit showing it stopped showing up right before i started the stream so i was in the middle of troubleshooting um so that's how we pull it in and we have just a div and we're setting the the content we're using dangerously set inner html because we want to preserve the html that's coming to us from wordpress and then down here is where we have our our table and we're also doing a map function over that that data that we're pulling in which right now is the nearby event data and we're just mapping over that and adding our tr's and our tds for each one of those so that's not really the exciting part that's kind of like basic react stuff you you just loop over things and add them here's where we're doing some of the the different sorting things so we actually this is where the jquery comes in we have this h scroller function that's being called and we use some some jquery coming from another file to do that but we wait and call it on componentdidmount so we don't have the document.ready function like we'd normally do instead we call our jquery from inside componentdidmount and that way we know that the component and that the the dom elements that we want the jquery to manipulate are actually loaded so that was kind of a little work around that we had to do this is not ideal for react so this is something that we had to do to get the site launched on time we were converting it from a site that already basically was doing all this stuff but it was using jquery so i'm not saying we should do it like this but if you have to do something like this that's how you make the jquery work let me know if you actually want to see how we did this in jquery you know go ahead and i i can for sure show you just let me know in the live chat if you're interested so for the date sorting right we need to get today's date obviously and one thing we're doing is we're not showing any dates that are before today so we automatically don't display events that have already happened right which makes sense the whole point of the table is to find events for you to go to you can't go to it if it already happened so that's why we're grabbing today's date and we're also getting the location so we're using this navigator.geolocation.getcurrentposition and what will happen here is the user will be prompted to allow geolocation if the user allows it then we can get the location if not then the location sorting functionality will not work which is okay that's entirely up to the user if that's something they they would like to do and then we're calling compare location so once we get the user's location and we're out we're saving all this into state so our state see we have user latitude lose user longitude all right we're going to store that there and here's where we're doing some some fun stuff i remember when we made this it was really cool when we got it working so we have our data we made a constant called new data and it's just all the data that we have in in state in this state data and we're mapping over each event okay we've actually taking let me check in here that's a probably location map all right so we're checking to make sure that that event has the location map property right so we don't want to try to do this if the event does not have a value for that we you know that would potentially give us errors or at the very least it would have event show up as being really close or really far away um and it's it's not really true it's just that there's no value there i forget what the what actually happened if we didn't check but that's why we need to check so this is a just kind of a long term area so think of like a ternary like a shorthand for an if statement so if we have this location map property then so after the question mark is then we do this so then we take the user latitude minus the latitude of that event plus the user longitude minus the longitude of the event and what that gives us is a number and the higher the number yeah let me double check i believe it is the higher the number the farther away the event is the lower the number the closer the event is so it ended up being i was a little bit worried about how are we going to judge these distances i was thinking we'd have to make another api call to some other service to get that but no just very simple math i mean literally addition and subtraction got us through here that's why i ended up being really pleased with this because i thought this is such a very like a simple solution to our problem um and then we have uh let's see if there is no location um then we do infinity i forget why we had to do infinity honestly i'd have to go back and watch the stream but this wasn't my idea somebody else put this in here to solve some problem um and then we're just returning uh the event clone which was our constant up here now we can sort all right so if you've never used sword it's actually it's really cool so we're sorting each each item right so a would be like the first item in in this array and then b would be the second item in this array so we remember we have an array of objects that's the format that our data is in so if item one this distance to event here's how we doing sorry this is not if this is uh distance to event minus b distance to event basically what this does is compares all of them and then sorts them so the the ones that have the lowest value will come first and then it'll go up all right we got through that it feel free to ask me to clarify this even more and like if you see something and you're not sure about it you like here it might be a little complicated like check it out on mdn mozilla developer network just type in like javascript.sort it'll be one of the first links and then you could probably get some like more simple examples and a better explanation i'm happy to answer your questions but i know i'm not as good as mdn so that's why i'm just i'm throwing that out there for you all right we're doing a similar thing with the date right so we're sorting by date you can see the same thing we have a um sort are we doing the date sort oh here we are so we have a sort here and um this date sword okay so we're actually able to do ascending and descending with a date and we store that in state why would we store that value in state i feel like i'm a teacher now sorry sorry but we want to store it in state because every time state changes it triggers a rerender in our component so to go back here if i didn't have this saved in state i could click on date all day long and nothing would happen right i could i it would be doing something in the click but it would never trigger a rerender so this isn't like i would put an on click handle on there and it would do stuff that's not how it works and react i mean potentially you could do it but that's not really the react way and so that's why we put that in in state and i've done that for a couple different projects uh some projects that i didn't stream uh is i had to use this for like for my udacity nanodegree some of those projects anytime you have to do any kind of sorting i found it always helpful to put that that sorting in states or if you're using redux you can put it in there as well but when you do that and you have a you know some sort of toggle or even a drop down we have multiple things to sort by it's um that's the way you want to do it to trigger the rerender all right let's see locations okay cool so here we have our our handle sort we're passing in sort by so if this syntax looks weird to you it's it's called an arrow function uh so just if you want to look up more about it type in arrow function javascript you'll see a ton of stuff it's part of the es 6 syntax or it it's officially called es2015 but a lot of people say es6 so handle sort and then this is the parameter that we're put we're passing in um and then here's our our arrow function because it looks like an arrow so that's the that's where we get the term arrow function from and then anything in here is actually our function so we have this sort by and it's just a switch statement so if we want to sort by date then we have the name date passed in here if we want to sort by location we do that the default is sort date so if we have nothing in here it defaults to sort date and let's see i don't remember why we needed two digits here something i needed to change the two digits so that's why we made this function uh but that's basically it that's how we did this sortable responsive table you can check out uh this code in github i haven't pushed this yet but if you go to the events.js component it has all the same stuff i just copied it from there so you can check it out right now in the repo this project is called ci react so ci hyphen react and uh you can go through that you know feel free to clone the project mess around with it use the code for your own project it's totally cool to do that and let's see so that's that's about it like i said i'm not ready i'm not ready to commit this yet because i messed up oh sorry i messed up something so we don't see the the background image so i don't really want to commit it with you know something messed up so i think i just i changed the id and i think that's what messed it up it's missing some css somewhere that it needed um so potentially i could just change the id back maybe i'll try it right now let's see if it works oh yeah yeah that was it it's just the id so for now actually i will commit this because cancel because the id i'm not doing anything special with this page it's i do want it to be identical to the events page in a sense uh so let me commit this now and that way you all can see everything so just walk you through the the process here i'm going to do a git status now this is on the branch called upgrade i have not put any of this on master yet so just be aware of that it won't be there by default on master you have to change the branch to upgrade i'll show you all how to do that in a second so i've added this and i've changed some things in the title component and i've changed some things in the styles now i just made a few adjustments there are some things that i didn't like how it looked on the page so that's that's what i did in here uh just very small uh adjustments on um just like size of things and padding and margins so let's go git add and i'm going to put a period there and that's going to add everything so now if i do a git status again we can see in green here these are all ready to be committed so now we can do get and when they're ready to be committed that's called being staged uh so this is like these are all in the staged part of the process of git committing so now we're going to commit and i'm going to do a flag dash m which means we're going to do a commit message and let's see we want uh let's see add page admin to our training page looks good oh what's going on i messed up something event section is defined but never used oh okay not a big deal let's check it out so we have some linting that runs and some auto formatting that happens when we go to commit and this is very useful because it caught this obviously this isn't an error that would have caused our app to crash but we still would would rather not push that so we're just going to go up to the top here and see this event section we i took that out because that was not needed for this particular page um but i forgot to take out the import so if i go back in i just press the up arrow key it brings my message right back up my my last command i can hit enter again and we'll redo that hopefully we're good now yay all right awesome so everything worked it told me i need to upgrade but other than that everything worked and now we're just going to do a get push origin upgrade right because i want to push this to the upgrade branch and there we go everything's there let's double check that and i'll show you how to get to it let me make this a bit bigger and increase the font size so i can get to it easily because it's one of my repositories here but if we go to fus fusmarcon is fps hyphen marcom is the organization and the project is ci hyphen react we go down here right now we're on the master branch and you see there's not very many updates because we've been doing all the latest updates on the upgrade branch so we just click that drop down go to upgrade and see now we have some updates that are a minute ago those are what we just we just did right so you can go into where we're at pages mentor training and here you can see everything that we just went over so i know a lot of you are really familiar with this and you don't you don't need the explanation but we do have some people who are are very new to coding and some people that don't really know anything at all about coding that watch um so this kind of explanation i think is is helpful uh hopefully you know some of you are new you don't have to say you're new i don't if you're going to be embarrassed by admitting that uh you know you're you don't know anything about github or something like that i don't think you have to be embarrassed but i totally understand if you don't want to say it but hopefully that helps you all i know it adds a little bit of time to the stream but i want to be as beginner friendly as i possibly can all right so at this point i need a drink and at this point since we're already on github i'd like to show you all some of the pull requests that were made and um and thank everyone that submitted pull requests and i'm just gonna kind of go over what's what's changed and it looks like i have a message here about the side menu let's check it out all right cool so uh angel is is working on that react native app that we're making so we're taking the resource center which we already made in react and we're just converting it to be able to work in react native so if you're not familiar with react native that means that we'll be able to run the resource center on android and ios as a native mobile application which is going to be awesome it's going to solve some browser issue problems that we've had i did read an interesting uh article recently and i i forget where i saw it so otherwise i'd let you know where it's at but it was basically making the argument that if we really care about our users we won't support older browsers because older browsers are not secure so by supporting older browsers we're enabling that behavior and we're actually contributing to our users being at risk like if if we handle sensitive data and we allow people in an old browser to actually make transactions on our site let's say it's an ecommerce site then we're allowing them to put their data at risk they probably don't even realize it so the the i think the title of the article was by supporting older browsers are we really like caring for do we really care about our users or do we care about our business right so from a business perspective you want everybody to be able to buy something no matter what browser they're on but if we're really caring about the users wouldn't we want to stop them from potentially leaking their data out from an old browser so that that's kind of changed the way i thought about things i still like to support browsers to an extent but i've kind of felt the the same way in in terms of supporting really old browsers is are we really doing anybody a favor by supporting older browsers so anyway i just it reminded me of that because we've had issues with the resource center not working with older browsers and i've i've tried to accommodate the older browsers but i'm not sure that that's that's the right move anyway if you all want to weigh in on that uh please do i'm interested to see you know what what you all think about that uh so basically from from the perspective of how we can best care for our users is it better to support older browsers or not support older browsers all right cool let's go to our repo here and most of the changes uh i'm sorry the pull requests that were merged in were for this franciscan react but we did have some for this react native so we'll look at that as well so i'm going to go into the pool requests and the ones that are closed and just check out the first few so i don't think i ever gave credit to angel for this one but this was a while ago last week fixed that center logo uh centered the logo on the sidebar which is awesome uh i know also updated material ui to the latest version so we were on 26.26 and we're now we're now on the latest version which is 0.28 so that's awesome evidently there were no breaking changes because everything still works and let's see we also have let's look at these look in here these ones so make social icons larger and center them great so for a while i've been bothered by the um social icons being like weirdly off center so now the social icons are bigger so thank you very much and let's see we also have the the text for that donate button is now uh corrected so now it says access fus so thank you for that as well and then we do have a pull request we had kind of a large pull request here and this was from angel as well and you can see basically this added a lot of stuff right uh a header with the green back u background for all the views uh drawer navigation uh if you're not familiar with react native navigation it's not the same as you'd normally navigate in a regular react web app so that's why we're talking about drawer navigation uh think of like being able to click links in a side drawer right on an app that's the kind of navigation we're talking about which like it's like you would expect from the name i suppose i also created the drawer the side menu um added some views added an about view and added an icon to the header so we can actually click to open the drawer so that's awesome you can check out all the changes here you can see quite a few eight files changed really nice a lot of good stuff here so if you want to know more about react native and how we set this up initially go back and check i think we called this project six so go back and check in the the live stream uh playlist and find the one that's project six i think it says react native in the title almost positive i'll have to separate this out into its own playlist at some point but right now we only have one video so i'm not gonna make a playlist with one video in it uh so anyway those are hopefully i didn't miss anything but those are the pull requests that we got and they're really awesome i'm i'm really glad that we have some progress here on this react native thing i don't have any time right now to work on it but i was always hoping that somebody would be interested in getting some practice and would want to want to work on this a bit so really glad about that thank you we also have an electron app if anybody's interested in electron so we're basically using react and electron to make an app that would could run on windows ios or i'm sorry mac os and and linux could run as a desktop app so that's also another project out there it just depends um depends on you know what you're interested in uh so if it's something you're you're into then you know please by all means go ahead if you know ask me what needs done or i can help walk you through things just let me know uh harsh it says show contributors data i wonder what's happened all right let me go to contributors you have three contributors our or you're still number one on this still number one cool and i guess we can show contributors data for our franciscan react as well i haven't shown that for a while i do like to show the contributors data to give you all credit so hey i'm actually the top contributor on my own project this time that's good um we got hardship close behind so i'll zoom in on everybody so y'all can see thank you everyone who contributed i really appreciate it okay i'm gonna go to the live chat now and i'm gonna answer as many questions as i can if you had any questions about anything that we've worked on it doesn't have to be a topic that we've covered already in the stream it could be any of the repos we're working on or just any question in general i'll answer pretty much anything uh as long as i mean i'll pretty much answer anything it'll be really obvious if something's not an appropriate question and i'll just skip that but otherwise i'm i'm i'm open so i'm scrolling way back up to the top sorry i had a missed call i think it was spam though just wanted to check um all right i just got a really surprising message from my wife wow it's nothing bad with my marriage or anything like that it's just somebody that we both know something crazy happened okay sorry i keep taking drinks if you weren't here at the beginning i have a sore throat so i'm just trying to keep myself from coughing and drinking helps um let's see all right so uh acrom says which javascript framework can i start learning um you could start learning any of them that you really want to if you'd like to be able to follow along with these streams i recommend learning react because that's what we use mostly if you're if you're really really new to javascript i recommend learning a little bit more javascript before you get into a framework you don't need to be in javascript expert but sometimes it's really hard to understand a framework if you don't have a basic knowledge of javascript so i'm not sure where you're at i don't mean to imply that that you don't know javascript but i i don't really know how much you know so uh if you're solid in your javascript like i said i recommend react but it depends on your goal if you have a company that you really want to get into that uses angular go with that uh if check out vue a lot of people like vue i mean there's still there are companies that use amber uh there's a lot of stuff out there so but i would say the top ones right now you're angular and reacts by far they're the top ones views getting a lot of more people using it but it's so it has momentum but it's not up to the level of uh angular and react i mean in terms of like total users and people people doing things with it uh hopefully that answered your question let me know if you have any followups to that uh dave says thanks for the work you put into this it has really helped me a lot oh you're welcome you're welcome thank you for uh telling me and let me know if there's anything i could do to make the streams better and more if you have any questions and that that's not just for dave that goes for for anyone if i'm doing something that you find really annoying or you think that you have a good idea for something i could do please let me know i can't guarantee that i'll change things based on that but i'll definitely take it into consideration and because i know i mean sometimes my videos get thumbs down i don't care if they get thumbs down it doesn't really make me cry or anything but what i really would like is give the thumbs down and then put something in the description that says here's why i gave you the thumbs down that way i can make things better uh all right that's always like on stack overflow you can downvote somebody's answer if i get a down vote and nobody tells me why i get a down vote i'm like well how am i supposed to give you a better answer next time i have no idea why you downvoted it i obviously thought it was a good answer i wouldn't have posted it right so anyway i'm the point is i'm trying to make is that i i welcome criticism in your ideas i do want to make this stream better and more helpful to you all uh nissar says jesse would you like to see your future full project with react native compatible uh with expo uh just pure javascript here's your full project with rec native compatible with expo just javascript i'm not exactly sure everything is going on in that question um but if i'd like to see my future full project with react native that would be cool that would actually be really cool i don't think that that's something that my boss even has on his mind at all about doing the university does currently have an app i had nothing to do with with the building of that app we hired another company to do it so um i think right now he's worried about just trying to work within that app structure he's not opposed to me having other apps though i've talked to him about for instance the resource center being a mobile app so i for sure want this website to be a progressive web app so i want people to be able to you know download the the shortcut you know on their phone be able to use it offline to a certain extent but if we can turn it into an app i'm cool with that as well uh ah i'm trying to remember how to spell that or how to pronounce that sorry uh duvoprio says uh no one replies like you do the way you help us with our personal projects and open a new tab for searching about our problems or us is really exceptional oh thanks for saying that i don't i mean i don't know honestly some of it i i like don't have a lot of people following me and i have the luxury being able to do this from work so a lot of the other youtube people or you know just people on twitter instagram or whatever sometimes they have a lot of followers you know i mean i have maybe i don't know my twitter is like almost 800 followers right there are people on there that have over 100 000 right so i have a tiny fraction of what they have so i'm not getting swamped in my dms by people so i definitely have the freedom and the fact that i can do this at work as part of my work and get paid for it kind of frees me up a little bit as well so having said that i mean i do really like to take the time to answer everybody uh the way i see it is i don't want to be the person that discourages somebody else and they don't go into coding i'd rather be the person that i'll never know it but maybe somebody was just on the brink of giving up and i say one encouraging thing and you know then they go forward right i'll probably never know about it but that's really at that point i could either say something encouraging or i could you know say nothing or say something you know derogatory towards them and then they they quit so i don't know that's how i think when i do stuff like this and when i try to answer and i'm not always the best i know there have been people who've asked me to like review their portfolio resume and i never really got back to them if that has happened to you please like send me a message and remind me because sometimes things just get really really busy with my work and my family and it just slips through so i don't want to pretend like i'm perfect when it comes to answering but i do try my best and uh but you know give the other people a break as well because i'm sure they have a lot more going on than i do and especially i don't want to go on too much of a tangent but i i would kind of like to mention this uh because i notice some of the female coders that i follow on twitter and on instagram they mention sometimes that they get a lot of direct messages from people um and sometimes they get inappropriate things message to them or you know so it's just hard like i don't get that you know i've never experienced that as as a male developer when people watch my stuff they they always talk about my code for the most part i mean occasionally somebody makes a comment on whether i shave my beard or not right but uh as a female developer a lot of the comments have to do with their appearance and it's like people just ignore their coding abilities so i just be careful about that and you know give them a break too if you're trying to ask them a question and that you know they have to deal with a lot more than i have to deal with and they've probably had some really bad experiences before so there may be a lot more you know careful so just be straightforward and you know if you send them a direct message don't just say hey what's up because they're probably gonna ignore it right because they probably get a million of those and then when they do answer it ends up being somebody who's you know not very nice to them so you know maybe say say something like hey uh you look like you really know what you're doing in coding i'm having this problem you know could you please answer my question right um you know don't start out with like you know the heart emojis and the heart eyes and saying you're so beautiful um and you're a good coder like now i mean i'm sure that's flattering sometimes but you know if you get that 500 times a day maybe it gets old i don't know if you all want to tell me how beautiful i am you know you i'm i'm open to that that would be fun but anyway all right that's my uh that's my message for the day is uh basically in general be nice to everybody when you do comments but especially um you know just kind of be aware of what some other uh coders on social media and on youtube have to deal with okay let me get back to the live chat oh harsh it said i'm late did i miss something um harsha you probably were able to catch up so let me know if you didn't and i'll i'll try to catch you up on things but you didn't really miss that much and you're super smart so i'm sure you caught up harsh it also says materialize eliminated jquery in version one i'll have to check that out because when we use materialize for this they still were dependent on jquery but i'm i'm actually really interested if that's the case that's really interesting i'll have to check it out i haven't looked at any of the updates for materialize in a while since we started using material ui for most of our our stuff uh oh uh i'm sorry i'm probably not gonna pronounce this right ogusan says what's the best ide uh i'm i'm currently using well if you want to consider visual studio code in ide which some people do some people don't but if you do want to consider an ide i really like visual studio code i've used atom before and i do like atom as well and you know so i think there's a lot of ids out there that are really close in terms of you know their functionality but right now i'm very happy with visual studio code harshit says so you switch to outlook how's it working i really like outlook is a huge improvement over what we did have before so you know for my personal stuff i use gmail but for work i use outlook and i love it we were using novell groupwise before which is really ancient and and terrible i'm sorry if you work at nobel group wise i'm sure you do hard work and you're good at your job but i'm sure you've also inherited a lot of legacy stuff and it's hard to work with so uh if you are working on that like keep working uh and do your best but i just can't in good conscience recommend it to anybody their their mobile capabilities were pretty much nonexistent if you're trying to go through your browser and um yeah it was just not fun to work with so far i really like outlook i really love the outlook app as well and i'm gonna give a shout out to uh marie clemency who works on the outlook app and i was i met her at november so i'm sure she's not watching but anyway if anybody knows marie or ever meets her she she's done a great job with the outlook app i'm really impressed uh tobe says love the beard thanks uh i had a poll on instagram yesterday about whether or not i should shave my beard and uh the the overwhelming majority said i should keep it so it's going to stay for a little while which is good because it's really cold outside but anyways as you sound a bit cold make sure you take those d vitamins i do need to take d vitamins i get no sunlight um and i am i have i don't know what i have a cold or something i don't know i feel i'm trying my best to just ignore it and pretend like i'm not sick but i'm so tired uh let's see harshit says that plus minus things is simple math kind of distance formula as far as it says difference of coordinates harsh it's typing in some math in here and uh harsha you're better at math than me because i'm like not even following it at this point the last math course i took was so long ago uh let's see harshad says you have not calculated the whole distance oh shoot it skipped down to the bottom sorry i gotta scroll back up uh you have not calculated the whole distance but that value works for comparison for complete accuracy i would have made the api called a google uh distance matrix api uh this gives distance by car plane bike etc yeah yeah like like i said i was thinking we'd have to go to an api but then i realized that we don't really need precise distance this is just in general also the the problem was as well is a lot of times the the woman who's in charge of doing entering the data doesn't really even know the exact location of these events she just knows the city so having more precise data wouldn't even be that helpful so anyway that's but that's good to point out though harsha so when we went over how i did the comparison of locations to tell which was farther away which was closer that was just a very general way to do it because for our use case that was sufficient if you wanted like people to actually have you know a really precise location you would want to use something like you know make an api to google and get to the more precise directions let's see coding in caffeine says i need coffee and yeah i could probably do with another cup of coffee i had like a half a cup of coffee earlier and it was what was left over from yesterday and i just heated it up uh let's see uh gander7 said okay so this is in response to when i was talking about browsers and whether or not it's a good idea to support older browsers particularly when you're thinking of what's the best thing for the user to support the browsers or not and to try to encourage them to upgrade their browsers so gander 7 says agreed we only support current browsers it is possible to let's see all right the next q the next statement doesn't have to do with that but yeah i'm starting to think like that as well that i should only support newer browsers but make have an easy way to explain to users and that they need to upgrade and then have links available for them to upgrade uh gander 7 also says is it possible to create an electron app that is selfcontained load urls uh loads load file um and handle react js versus load a server localhost i've been trying to find i've been trying but can't find a way um i'm i'm not really sure so i i have never successfully made an electron react app yet we just got one started so we we basically have like a hello world app running and it works but you know that's that's not really like i mean i made an app so i don't really know um but if you want to follow along with our project i can't tell you for sure when i'm gonna have time to work on it uh but maybe you know in the process of that you know we'll have to answer that question john hanson's here uh says hi all late i was eating yeah no problem um harsh it says i'm i'm busy nowadays i'm not able to contribute yeah i totally understand you told me school started and everything so you've contributed so much hardship i really appreciate it so don't don't worry i don't know if you're worrying about it hopefully not because you don't need to worry at all you've done so much and i i do i appreciate that and everybody here in my department appreciates it i told them at meetings how much work you have done so they they all know that you've done uh you know really good work and uh i even told them i said arshad's better than me he does great work like it's he's he's awesome so you do what you have to do for school and don't worry about this uh john says different skins hard to do on page x page y or client x client y on different screens and devices okay i'm not sure it was that was that was directed to harshit for something um oh cool harshit says check out ant design it's like material design but they made it completely for react all right cool uh it's it dot design let me i'm gonna type it in on my other screen here so don't forget all right just scrolling through their website their website looks good so that's that's uh good sign right off the bat got a lot of stars on github very cool i'll check that out later thanks uh thanks for the the lane carson uh s shravan says how to differentiate between um admin and user in authentication please help me to get the knowledge i'm using react uh all right i'll definitely need some more info for that uh but i'm happy to help if i can um a harsh respondent said are you using uh json web tokens or cookies let's see okay so stravan is using json web tokens and firebase all right it looks like harshit is is offering some advice on that so i'm going to defer to harshi because i know he's more experienced with that kind of stuff and uh harsh is coming from back end and moving into front end stuff as well so that's something that he's going to be way more familiar with i'm coming from front end and learning more about back end and using it uh let's see i lost my place here harshad said do you know oh sorry john hanson says for some odd reason learning pug for html taught me a lot when it came to learning javascript that's cool that's cool i um back when pug was called jade i did some stuff with it but i have not used it for a really long time at least a year or more harsha says do you know it cost points to download and stack overflow i didn't realize i don't think i've ever downloaded anything in stack overflow usually if there's a terrible answer it's already been downloaded or downloaded so many times it's like why even bother gander 7 says you got one more on twitter now awesome thanks thanks yeah if uh if you do follow me on twitter i do tweet about when i'm gonna stream and what i'm gonna stream about so it might be helpful for you to decide whether or not you want to watch a stream on a particular day and i also will retweet like if you tweet and say you're looking for a job or you need advice on something and i see that like i'll i'll retweet it so uh if you want to like tag me in the tweet so i definitely see it you know go ahead and do that and you know i'm more than happy like i said i don't have that many people following me but i can get you some exposure you know maybe you can get some more retweets from other people that have a bigger following so i can't really do much more than that but i'll do what i can for you oh harsha completed the the new westboss grid course that's awesome that just came out like yesterday right good job on that uh he said it was very good so that's really cool so if you want to learn more about css grid check out the new course from westboss it's css grid dot io it's completely free so go ahead and check that out i definitely want to check it out i just have a lot going on right now so i don't know if i'm going to be able to but at some point i do want to check that out uh olsa says it's good to see real life project working uh process i'm still new in web development so touching everything here and there so just wanted to say thank you for your streams it helps and motivates oh you're welcome you're welcome comments like that help and motivate me so i'm glad i'm glad you said that and i'm glad that my stream is is helping you out uh pollux says where to learn best practices about react in javascript um really the the react documentation is a good place to to go um i think with javascript best practices i mean mdn mozilla developer network is good if you want to learn about specific parts of javascript otherwise i mean maybe a book series like like you don't know js is free online eloquent javascript is a free book online and you can buy the paper version of it as well but those are good places to learn more about javascript you could check out some javascript style guides from big companies like airbnb has a very popular style guide for javascript standard js has one those can help i mean in terms of like how should you properly format and do things if anyone else has any suggestions on that please put it in the in the live chat michael says hey oh it's been a while hey michael how's it going thanks for joining let's see harsh is still trying to help stravon with his um authentication uh questions and one of josh's responses was it's easy i can show you how harsh it makes everything look easy some of the things that that you can do are probably easy to you but not not to me so so just remember that if harsha tells you something's easy it may not actually be easy david says vitamins are a scam even if the vitamins are just a placebo effect for me i'll take it at this point i don't really care because i just i i want to not be sick and have more energy oh okay harsha said school hasn't started yet it'll start on 13th of february let's see okay john says uh the google maps api has a way to put directions from the visitors location it's fairly simple to implement on a website it's to put it in a react app is a bit more tricky all right that's really cool like i said for this app i don't think it's necessary but that's good to know i it would actually be really cool to do that in some of the other stuff that i've been working on uh some like previous sites i i have a previous site that's not a react app where that could be really useful i think so when i have time at some point maybe we'll add that in divo says hi hey evo how's it going thanks for joining george asks if there's any firebase projects coming in the future i can't say for sure i i'd love to work with firebase i've learned a little bit about it and heard other people uh use it and heard them talk about it so i i'm really interested but i have to find some way to work it into a project and if i can i'll work with it but like i said i can't can't guarantee anything uh let's see sorry i don't know exactly how to pronounce this name it's berke so beric berka um says can you suggest a source to learn react for beginners check out the tutorial from the actual react website that's a good place to start code academy has a tutorial that would probably be good to go through free code camp their new beta curriculum has some react stuff in there i haven't tried it yet but usually the free code camp stuff is pretty good uh so those places i think are a good place to start um john says jen simmons has started a new youtube channel called layout and layout land she knows css grid like no one else all right really cool i'll have to check that out uh thanks for that john well harshit said she wrote it spec wow that's i would say she knows it she wrote the spec that's really cool harsha said she even kind of corrected westboss for making imperfect advice on the grid on twitter wow all right maybe i have to check out that youtube channel then i like youtube videos for code stuff because like when i'm eating i usually just eat in my office at my desk and i watch a video um some type of coding tutorial or something so i'm always looking for for new videos and useful things evo says doing pretty good sign my contract today with which i can start working next monday awesome awesome congratulations uh i understand you'll probably be pretty busy but if you could remember let me know like how your first day goes your first week or whatever i'm i'm really interested in that so uh so don't forget about us when you're you know busy uh building cool things and making lots of money all right well i've gotten to the bottom of the live chat and i think i'm gonna wrap things up now i can't believe i've been streaming for almost an hour and a half uh okay now's a great time to end it's friday so we're gonna have the weekend i'll be back most likely on monday there is um a storm that's gonna come through maybe sometime next week so if it storms really bad and i can't make it into work probably won't have a stream so just be aware that there may be some days when i can't stream next week just depending on what happens with the weather otherwise i'm planning on streaming every day if i can um let's see uh one more comment i'll read this out evo says about the video watching and coding one thing i noticed is that nonprogrammers find it weird that we really enjoy learning more about our expertise oh that's interesting that is true you know coders seem like we love what we're doing like we watch stuff we go home and think about code we may have side projects like yeah i mean i guess you don't see that in every um every profession but that's cool we're passionate about what we do we really like it i think it's a good thing as long as you don't overdo it you know ignore your family or your health or anything like that but um anyway that's a good observation evo all right so have a wonderful weekend everyone thank you so much for watching and for all your help in the live chat i will be back monday see ya
