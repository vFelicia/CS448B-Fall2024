00:08 - hey everybody is Jessie and I hope
00:13 - everyone had a have a good weekend
00:15 - I spent all most of my weekend on on a
00:25 - redux reactor Redux project so I think
00:31 - I'm finally getting the hang of Redux
00:34 - which is awesome so hopefully there'll
00:35 - be a Redux project for the live streams
00:39 - sometime soon
00:41 - so trying to figure out what the next
00:43 - project will be after this one which
00:45 - we're almost finished with and I think
00:49 - I've realized that I'm actually not that
00:52 - at Redux
00:53 - but I'm bad at spelling so that's he
00:58 - could be more of my problem when I was
01:01 - trying to debug some of the stuff that
01:03 - I've been working on I kept thinking I
01:06 - wasn't I didn't understand Redux but it
01:08 - wasn't that it was mostly just typos
01:13 - alright so today's gonna be we're gonna
01:18 - do about an hour long stream so I have
01:21 - an appointment coming up a little bit
01:22 - later on also just a heads up if my wife
01:25 - calls I'm gonna have to answer it
01:27 - because she's not feeling well
01:28 - and she might need help with the kids so
01:30 - I might have to end the stream earlier
01:32 - so hopefully that doesn't happen and
01:34 - she's feeling alright but I it maybe an
01:39 - abrupt ending here so before we get
01:42 - started with any code a couple things I
01:44 - want to show you one is a bow wrote an
01:48 - article in medium free code camps medium
01:51 - about how to contribute to the YouTube
01:53 - channel so if you're interested in
01:56 - contributing in some way check this out
01:59 - and really useful stuff on there so
02:05 - actually as I was reading through this I
02:07 - was reading about you know what he said
02:09 - about having a video of
02:13 - of myself on the on the screen so if you
02:20 - notice today I do have video of myself
02:22 - on the screen so I try to make it as
02:26 - small as possible it wouldn't cover up a
02:27 - lot of the code I'll try this out I
02:30 - figure it's worth the shot and it's it's
02:36 - not like it it's really any extra work
02:38 - once it's set up the video just appears
02:41 - so oops I think I accidentally clicked
02:45 - on something but anyway I just wanted to
02:46 - share that with you there's a lot of
02:47 - different ways that you can contribute
02:49 - if you want to like captioning and
02:51 - things like that or even creating your
02:53 - own videos so check that out if you have
02:56 - a chance also wanted to just do
02:59 - something fun since we're kind of at the
03:01 - end of this project I thought it would
03:03 - be cool to go back and look at where we
03:05 - started or actually where I started so I
03:09 - want to show you let's start with this
03:12 - first so about two years ago almost two
03:15 - years ago this was I took the screenshot
03:19 - on October 10th 2015 I'm sorry October
03:23 - 14th 2015 this was the very first
03:28 - version of the Resource Center and this
03:33 - version never actually went live like
03:36 - this they were obviously a lot of
03:38 - changes but this was the home page so
03:41 - you can see some of the stuff is similar
03:43 - we still have a lot of the you know same
03:45 - options and everything the side menu was
03:48 - just these these buttons so when you
03:51 - click this it just brought the buttons
03:54 - in and out so definitely that's probably
03:57 - the biggest change other than the colors
04:00 - we also had the look here's the logo
04:04 - page so the logo page is a little bit
04:06 - different we had this this side instead
04:08 - of every all the options being at the
04:10 - top I had them down the side service
04:13 - request form similar we actually had to
04:16 - split onto two pages and it still had
04:20 - you know the cool checkbox effect that
04:23 - that I liked and we had the material
04:26 - designs
04:27 - style inputs also you can see definitely
04:31 - changed up the color scheme a bit this
04:33 - is a little bit heavy with the gold
04:36 - color here but but just be cool to kind
04:40 - of see where we came from and I
04:43 - definitely learned how to better utilize
04:45 - these action buttons he's floating
04:47 - action buttons for material design and I
04:50 - learned that you shouldn't have a
04:51 - million of them on the page just one
04:53 - also here's some sketch mock-ups that I
04:56 - had done as well so you could see some
04:58 - alternate designs that I thought of
05:00 - doing so here's one this was in response
05:03 - to some feedback that said well people
05:07 - might not even know that you can click
05:08 - in these areas right because they just
05:10 - have the line so I added this kind of
05:13 - darker background color we I used some
05:16 - of the alternate colors so here's that
05:17 - that yellow color that we've been using
05:19 - as an accent color but as the primary
05:22 - color this time with kind of actual
05:26 - outlines around the the fields in the
05:30 - same way just a little bit different
05:32 - this is actually somewhat close in color
05:34 - scheme to what we use now is you know
05:38 - just this yellow is the accent color
05:40 - here's an old green and white and here's
05:42 - lots of gold and then here's a blue
05:45 - color that's in our color palette so
05:48 - actually here's the I don't think I've
05:50 - used this on any projects on the stream
05:52 - but here's the dark blue and the light
05:53 - blue that are also in the color palette
05:55 - and then this is just another alternate
06:00 - so anyway this is sketched by the way if
06:03 - you're not if you haven't seen this
06:04 - before it's it's a cool program to just
06:09 - do like mock-ups and stuff with designs
06:11 - I don't I don't use it often usually
06:13 - just at the beginning of a project
06:15 - sometimes if I need to show show someone
06:19 - what I'm thinking and have it be a
06:22 - little bit better than me just trying to
06:23 - draw it on a piece of paper then I do it
06:26 - like that but anyway I found those I had
06:33 - those at screenshots still saved on my
06:34 - desktop so I just thought it'd be cool
06:37 - to check them out
06:40 - all right so let me check out the live
06:42 - chat and say hi to everybody before we
06:44 - get started let's see someone asked
06:57 - sorry I can't read the name but it says
07:00 - hi who can recommend SF SFTP / STP
07:05 - plugin for atom like SFTP for sublime
07:09 - I'm sorry I don't have I I don't know of
07:12 - any plugins like that I've never used
07:14 - any plugins for atom but maybe someone
07:16 - else in the live chat I may know about
07:18 - it
07:20 - peyt hey chase says hi from South Africa
07:22 - hey how's it going thanks for watching
07:24 - they have someone from India awesome
07:28 - thanks I I'm on says I'm too chatty
07:33 - yeah no I'm no I'm too chatty let's see
07:46 - all right cool
07:50 - let me get started oh cool yeah dispute
07:53 - some more shout outs from where we were
07:54 - when we said hello from Israel from
07:57 - Ireland awesome I'm gonna get started
08:04 - shriek ah s is this project towards the
08:07 - end yes yes it's it's almost finished
08:12 - really probably any day now we'll be
08:14 - we'll be done with it at this point I'm
08:16 - just kind of waiting for feedback of the
08:18 - official like yes this is fine we can
08:20 - launch this and then we'll be done we
08:22 - might actually start a new project
08:24 - before this launches because I don't
08:26 - want to be waiting for feedback and just
08:28 - doing little updates like even to be
08:31 - honest with you today's stream I was
08:33 - having trouble coming up with a title
08:35 - and a topic for it
08:37 - because there's not that much left to do
08:39 - so we're really gonna be I'll show you
08:42 - my my Trello board this is we're gonna
08:44 - work on today there's something there's
08:48 - kind of a weird thing going on with the
08:50 - cursor when we move over the upload
08:52 - button so we're going to try to fix that
08:54 - on small screens that icon that
08:57 - information icon we have on at this
09:00 - point only one of our check boxes
09:02 - overlaps the text so we need to fix that
09:04 - as well and then if we have time we need
09:07 - to fix the spacing between some
09:09 - elements in the form it's just it's not
09:12 - uniform so but you can see we're getting
09:14 - down to some things that are just I mean
09:17 - they're definitely I want to fix but
09:19 - they're not really like super important
09:22 - so so we may end up just moving on to
09:26 - the next project and then you know maybe
09:29 - I'll come back to this if something
09:30 - major needs to be changed but if we can
09:33 - get these three things accomplished I'll
09:35 - be happy actually if we can just get the
09:37 - first two accomplished in this stream
09:38 - I'll be fine with that
09:41 - let's see so let's go let me show you
09:45 - what the first thing is so we can get
09:47 - started on it I'm going to start my
09:49 - Pomodoro timer and we're gonna do 25
09:55 - minutes of coding and then five minutes
09:56 - I'll go back to the live chat and answer
09:58 - any questions you have we'll probably do
10:00 - two sessions like that two 25-minute
10:02 - sessions and then I'll I'll answer any
10:05 - questions you have before I end the
10:07 - stream so today we'll just do two
10:09 - sessions since I have an appointment a
10:11 - little bit later on see okay so here's
10:18 - what's what the problem is so you can
10:21 - see the cursor turns into the you know
10:25 - the pointer that's let's you know
10:27 - something's clickable but then once you
10:29 - get to the middle it changes and then it
10:33 - goes back so there's this whole area
10:34 - right in the middle right that huh
10:42 - interesting
10:45 - yes so there's there's a large area not
10:47 - not exactly in the middle right it's
10:49 - more like it starts here and goes all
10:52 - the way out so we just I just want to
10:54 - fix that it's probably going to mean
10:56 - easy fix
10:56 - I hope it's gonna be an easy fix but I
10:59 - just happened to see it at some point
11:03 - last week and figured you know may as
11:07 - well this will change it so I want to
11:10 - try to look at first and see what what
11:13 - is that element this has got to be
11:20 - something
11:32 - hmm button so I'm using of course dev
11:40 - tools Reggie this is just chrome dev
11:42 - tools with the dark theme on here and
11:45 - I'm just kind of going through the
11:46 - elements here trying to figure out
11:50 - really I was trying to see if there's
11:52 - some element that had that basic shape
11:54 - that we were seeing here with the with
11:59 - the cursors that we could see the change
12:01 - I'm not seeing anything with exactly
12:03 - that shape I do want to see what do we
12:08 - have with cursor:pointer on it right now
12:11 - so we have that has the cursor pointer
12:13 - on it so let's change that let's see
12:15 - where that's at let's remove it and see
12:24 - okay so that didn't really affect
12:28 - interesting let's see if we put it on
12:32 - here as well no we don't have it on
12:35 - there okay
12:38 - cursor points are we have it on this
12:41 - span let's take that off mm interesting
12:47 - so I'm going through right now and just
12:49 - kind of removing it and it's interesting
12:55 - that there's been no change really
12:58 - cursor:pointer okay I'm guessing that
13:02 - this is gonna be the one that really
13:05 - there we go okay so that's the one that
13:09 - we're really getting the the pointer
13:12 - from that's interesting all right so I'm
13:19 - gonna bring this back so it's
13:22 - interesting that it works but then
13:23 - there's something here
13:33 - we've already seen that these two had
13:37 - cursor:pointer on them as well now let's
13:43 - go in here and see oh yeah
13:57 - ah
14:00 - so I'm not seeing it not seeing anything
14:03 - else here this is all oh yeah
14:15 - interesting
14:45 - what I'm going to check now then since I
14:48 - couldn't find anything here obviously in
14:51 - this div that would be coming over top
14:55 - of that I'm gonna check this div over
14:57 - here and I'll probably check this one as
15:01 - well I just you know what let me I'd
15:08 - like to change the screen size a bit and
15:10 - see if that makes a difference because I
15:12 - think that'll give me a clue as to where
15:14 - this is coming from if we can find it
15:16 - oops okay so it's still happening
15:33 - okay well that's interesting I was
15:36 - hoping it would be different on a
15:37 - smaller screen and then that would that
15:41 - would point me in the right direction
15:43 - here but it's not while we're here on
15:46 - the small screen you can see that this
15:47 - is that that icon that's overlapping so
15:51 - it should be out here but when we get
15:55 - down smaller it it overlaps we need to
15:58 - fix that as well I'll open this up a
16:02 - little bit again and now now after
16:08 - seeing what I did on a small screen I
16:10 - don't think we're gonna have any any
16:12 - luck by going to these other divs
16:16 - because the order since the order of
16:20 - everything kind of changed so this is
16:23 - above it you know and this one's on the
16:24 - side but then this one ends up being two
16:27 - above it and this one is above it
16:29 - there's nothing on the side I don't
16:30 - think there's anything in those dips so
16:32 - I'm not even going to check because
16:33 - that's um you know probably about 95%
16:36 - sure there's gonna be a waste of time at
16:38 - this point so
16:46 - I think I'd like to try putting
16:48 - cursor:pointer on this container because
16:52 - there doesn't seem to be any real reason
16:54 - why it couldn't be because I
16:56 - if you click if I click this I don't
16:59 - even necessarily want it to where you
17:06 - could just click and potentially I mean
17:08 - I think I have it yeah you can't type in
17:10 - there but it looks like you could when
17:13 - you click it so I don't think I want it
17:14 - like that anyway so let's make this
17:20 - whole thing actually just on this one
17:32 - Hershey's who here
17:36 - let's see if we can mmm no it's the same
17:42 - same problem here
17:51 - interesting
18:02 - hmm I just happened to look over at the
18:06 - live chat again Cronus says hello from
18:11 - Miami Florida I'm stuck in my room
18:13 - upstairs wow that's that's pretty crazy
18:19 - how so are you safe there I know they
18:25 - have if you just in case you don't know
18:28 - Florida is getting hit with these huge
18:32 - hurricanes like right more it's pretty
18:35 - bad so I've seen pictures and video down
18:37 - there so I hope you're alright
18:42 - and you're safe down there where you're
18:44 - at
18:47 - Wow is it is it really bad in Miami
18:50 - right now
18:52 - okay coding and caffeine said maybe the
18:55 - z-index that's a good idea I was
18:57 - thinking about that earlier and then I
19:00 - forgotten okay yeah let's check some
19:04 - z-index stuff here
19:09 - yeah the input should actually have the
19:21 - interesting
19:23 - there we go there we go check this out
19:30 - this is our area where we're having the
19:35 - the problem right here where this says
19:38 - choose files so that's a problem that's
19:43 - a problem right there so if we couldn't
19:45 - see it all right so let's as long as we
19:51 - can move this out of the way and get rid
19:54 - of it somehow we should be fine
19:56 - let's try to change the Z index let's go
20:03 - this should fix it yep it does mm-hmm
20:08 - but now we can't upload so that's no
20:17 - good
20:29 - all right so we need
20:50 - okay so there was something I can't
20:54 - remember what the property is let me
20:59 - think about this I use this on a project
21:02 - within the last few months
21:05 - essentially what what I'm thinking is
21:07 - there was some sort of property where I
21:10 - could pass through the clique basically
21:12 - through to an element that's below and
21:17 - maybe I'm maybe I'm remembering this
21:20 - wrong but I thought there was a way that
21:22 - I could do that
21:24 - essentially what I'm thinking of doing
21:26 - is setting this E and X back farther but
21:31 - then having to see what it was called
21:51 - let me see if anybody pointer events
21:53 - there we go
21:54 - I was thinking click events thank you
21:57 - John Hanson in the live chat just just
21:59 - put it in there thank you so much
22:02 - yeah so it's pointer events let's let's
22:05 - try this so let's put that Z index back
22:08 - on here now we have so we have some
22:13 - stuff over top of it
22:15 - that we want to set the pointer events
22:31 - let me do this just wanna do none here
22:36 - and then below
22:38 - see now I it's been too long since I've
22:41 - used this I can't I can't remember how
22:44 - this may be we have to put this one has
22:51 - to have four events
23:04 - no that's not it
23:19 - okay I have a link wearing shoe put a
23:25 - link in the live chat and so let me
23:33 - check this out
23:34 - I'd rather so I haven't looked at this
23:37 - yet but it says talking about styling
23:50 - styling inputs I don't want to I really
23:53 - don't want to get into styling like too
23:57 - much because I mean we already have the
24:05 - styles in here all right let me check
24:13 - out the live chat now because it seems
24:14 - like you all are putting a lot of advice
24:17 - in here so
24:25 - just thinking so embarrassed I was
24:27 - thinking of a way to change the div dot
24:29 - button label for upload try that
24:33 - position:absolute was the index for one
24:35 - okay let's we could play with the
24:42 - z-index a bit and see if we could get it
24:51 - let's try
25:04 - all right now I have cursor:pointer on
25:06 - here but it's not working on it's not
25:17 - working on it I wonder if there's any
25:21 - way to force it to work
25:39 - probably not
25:50 - yeah I guess
26:01 - yeah I kind of don't want to do it like
26:02 - this but this is probably gonna be the
26:04 - way to go what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
26:10 - put actually now I don't know if I can
26:21 - that's all should be on the upper layer
26:23 - of the C index item was a background on
26:34 - okay John John Hanson was giving me some
26:38 - advice on these pointer events
26:52 - let's see
27:14 - you should use a label before linking it
27:20 - to the file input okay
27:34 - I'm getting I'm getting two different
27:36 - sets of advice in the in the the live
27:40 - chat so let me let me pick one we'll try
27:43 - that out and see if it works now I've
27:47 - gotten a third or fourth okay I have
27:49 - quite a few different different paths
27:52 - here so I'm gonna try the simplest first
27:56 - and then if it doesn't work I'll move on
27:59 - and go down down the list
28:01 - okay so I'll do my best to describe what
28:04 - what each one is alright so it looks
28:08 - like the simplest suggestion to try
28:11 - would just be let's go back to here
28:26 - appearance none
28:31 - okay not working
28:43 - yes okay so that did not work I
28:51 - jarvez suggested that thank you for the
28:54 - suggestion let me know if I did I
28:56 - implemented that wrong but right now
28:58 - it's not working okay I'll move on to
29:26 - let's let's try this label so the next
29:31 - suggestion is make a label for the for
29:41 - the file for the input so let's try this
29:47 - so let me see if I can I assume that I
29:52 - guess I shouldn't assume it but I was
29:55 - assuming that one of these also has a
29:57 - label on here but I guess not oh well
30:04 - here we go
30:05 - but is this even doing it alright let's
30:12 - put this
30:19 - so is it possible
30:42 - whoops and the four the four goes with
30:47 - the name correct and not the
31:11 - alright not working good okay I'm bear
31:14 - to assist it does get with the ID all
31:16 - right I wasn't sure it's one of those
31:25 - things that I really I rarely do this on
31:29 - like by hand you know there's always
31:31 - some sort of framework or you just copy
31:33 - and paste the examples so it's been it's
31:38 - been quite a while
31:39 - feel like the only time I actually do
31:41 - this form inputs by hand as if I'm doing
31:45 - like tutorial exercises or something
31:48 - okay Fars ID okay
32:17 - all right let me try this looks like you
32:19 - need a label not a div yeah that's what
32:21 - I was thinking haha Robin says so is
32:25 - being a developer copy and paste not
32:29 - exactly
32:31 - it doesn't vote copy and pasting but
32:33 - that's not all alright let's see in
32:37 - class button alright let's take this off
32:43 - of here for now
32:50 - let's make those
33:07 - a whole nice
33:19 - okay so that works definitely want to
33:37 - okay great alright so that works now I
33:41 - wanted it to be so that if you clicked
33:43 - over here you could also upload so let's
33:47 - just try to put that over here yeah
33:52 - let's try to change that make this the
33:54 - label instead
34:03 - and see if we can get that to work
34:28 - mmm now it looks like that's not working
34:31 - let's see oh okay
34:35 - so when I change this to label it
34:38 - definitely changed some of what was
34:43 - going on here so let's see okay
35:01 - all right well at least we have the
35:07 - full-width but it's still hey there we
35:11 - go so it is if you saw that so I did
35:16 - click out here somewhere and it worked
35:19 - there you go so basically we have this
35:21 - this kind of covering things up right
35:24 - now so let's yeah let's go
35:51 - all right Susie index is not working for
35:54 - that now let's see
36:05 - see if we can go back to our pointer
36:07 - events all right
36:19 - great and let's make sure it's awesome
36:25 - okay so that works so my my timer just
36:29 - went off as well so this is good timing
36:30 - so let me just explain what what ended
36:34 - up working so we we made a label of this
36:45 - div here that was basically just a
36:46 - container div that span this entire area
36:50 - so we turn this into a label with a four
36:53 - attribute that matched the ID of our
36:56 - input right so that's big I mean that's
36:59 - nothing really groundbreaking right
37:02 - that's just like basic HTML how this
37:04 - works right you click the label and it
37:06 - activates the input so we did that we
37:11 - made sure that we put cursor:pointer on
37:13 - this so that we got that that cursor
37:16 - everywhere the problem was that this was
37:21 - acting like a like a text area which we
37:26 - don't want to act exactly like a text
37:28 - area we don't want it to seem like you
37:30 - could click in there and type we wanted
37:33 - when you click on this for the file
37:36 - upload to be activated so we had to go
37:39 - down here to where this wrapper is for
37:44 - that for that text area and there we
37:48 - added our pointer events none so we
37:49 - actually ended up combining several of
37:51 - approaches that you all suggested in the
37:53 - live chat which is pretty cool and it
37:56 - all worked so now so far we've only done
37:58 - this in dev tools so let me go over to
38:00 - the actual code and do this and then
38:02 - I'll do my five minutes of answer
38:05 - questions in the live chat I just don't
38:07 - want to forget this in the five minutes
38:09 - that I answer questions so let's go over
38:12 - to the code and change this so our
38:16 - service requests thought I had a service
38:19 - request for them open here there we go
38:20 - so it is open here let's see where
38:25 - upload is here we go
38:27 - okay so this was what we turned into a
38:30 - label
38:32 - let's make this a label
38:44 - who's that
38:52 - there we go
38:59 - all right so there's our label we also
39:01 - needed to change this there we go we
39:11 - needed to change this to display:block
39:14 - because when we added the label then it
39:16 - was no longer display:block so we needed
39:19 - that we need to we need to add the
39:23 - upload nor the before okay upload so
39:32 - that's it through for this area right
39:35 - foot didn't we need to put
39:37 - cursor:pointer I think we did let's do
39:39 - that as well there's a pointer and down
39:48 - here
39:57 - for a file path wrapper okay we already
39:59 - have it here for a file path wrapper we
40:01 - need to do pointer events none all right
40:08 - let's try that out
40:09 - save that and we'll save that and let's
40:15 - just give it a hard refresh make sure
40:19 - you clear out everything here in dev
40:20 - tools
40:21 - okay so let's whoops
40:32 - oops I forgot we needed to put make the
40:35 - z-index for this input nothing we had a
40:41 - negative one so if we go file field I
40:51 - think this is the only input so I think
40:54 - we're safe to just say input here
41:08 - there we go okay so now we have our
41:11 - pointer over this whole thing we click
41:16 - it great we get that
41:19 - let's awesome alright cool so mission
41:28 - accomplished on that one and that took
41:34 - it did take a little over one Pomodoro
41:37 - session but since I was trying to
41:40 - narrate what I was doing at the same
41:41 - time I think we'll leave it at one all
41:45 - right great
41:45 - let me turn on my five-minute timer and
41:50 - I'm gonna go through the live chat and
41:52 - see what what questions you all have see
42:00 - all right so I'm going all the way up to
42:02 - the top
42:08 - taught tough fix it says wish your wife
42:12 - quick recovery thank you so much
42:14 - I if you weren't here at the beginning I
42:16 - mentioned that my wife's not feeling
42:17 - well so I may have to if she needs me I
42:20 - may have to end the stream and go help
42:22 - out with the kids but so far so good but
42:24 - thank you I appreciate you saying that
42:28 - Mau Mau Russa says you guys are awesome
42:32 - thank you I appreciate that
42:43 - oh cool
42:48 - I can't I'm sorry so I remember having
42:53 - trouble with this name last time because
42:54 - it's not I wanted to say Brian but I
42:58 - don't think it was Brian Bri a I and I'm
43:03 - really sorry I usually can remember but
43:05 - this one I couldn't remember so let me
43:07 - know what let me know how it was I know
43:11 - I eventually got it right so please let
43:13 - me know how to pronounce that properly I
43:15 - don't want to mess it up anymore but
43:17 - anyway he said I liked the last examples
43:21 - of the sketch mock-ups I don't remember
43:24 - what the last one was let me see okay so
43:26 - I'm guessing it's it's this one the last
43:28 - example with all the colors so cool
43:33 - thanks yeah I kind of I thought it was
43:37 - cool I actually think it would be cool
43:38 - to do to have like a little Easter Egg
43:41 - in the in the the site somewhere to
43:45 - where you could just change the colors
43:46 - up so it wouldn't really be that obvious
43:49 - that you could do it but if you if you
43:52 - searched around enough you'd be able to
43:53 - toggle all the colors that'd be cool if
43:56 - I had a lot of time if maybe I would do
43:59 - that
44:07 - Shandra asks which text editor do you
44:10 - recommend I use plugins for code editor
44:17 - I use atom and I would recommend atom I
44:20 - like it but I also like Visual Studio
44:23 - code so those two I have actually used
44:27 - and would recommend I can't personally
44:30 - recommend anything else because I
44:31 - haven't really there's nothing else that
44:33 - I've used in really light but I have
44:35 - heard that sublime is is pretty good and
44:39 - for people who know them it's really
44:42 - cool and they they really like it I when
44:45 - I see people use them I'm always really
44:47 - impressed with it but the learning
44:50 - curves a little bit higher than
44:51 - something like like atom sublime
45:03 - notice we have Marcus it's a loaf from
45:05 - Serbia hey how's it going
45:11 - Nova blue asked what editor are you
45:13 - using I'm using Adam Srikant says we'll
45:19 - ask the new project also be react
45:24 - I don't know so actually this let me
45:30 - know what you all think we've done so
45:32 - far we've done to react projects would
45:36 - you really like another react project
45:38 - you like something else I'm gonna tell
45:40 - you let me tell you what's what's up so
45:42 - I talked to my boss this morning to try
45:44 - to figure out what the priorities are in
45:46 - terms of the projects that are that I
45:48 - know I'm gonna have to work on at some
45:50 - point you know in this this year that I
45:55 - thought that we would have a project
45:57 - it'd be a good candidate for react and
45:59 - maybe even redux but it turns out that
46:02 - that's not really a higher priority I
46:04 - thought it was a higher priority than it
46:05 - was so that can wait and might not even
46:08 - it might be more towards like the end of
46:11 - the year like December so for the
46:14 - immediate future so basically for this
46:16 - month for September the main website for
46:21 - Franciscan edu needs some work but it
46:24 - doesn't need it's not gonna be react not
46:27 - yet I'm eventually gonna redo that site
46:29 - completely and react but for right now I
46:33 - don't think I can dedicate the time to
46:36 - that although I'd love to redo it so for
46:38 - right now it's probably just gonna be me
46:40 - going through we currently exists and
46:42 - trying to make it better so cleaning up
46:45 - the UI trying to make it faster where I
46:48 - can mainly by you know getting rid of
46:52 - unused code and kind of eliminating a
46:58 - lot of the the image it's really image
46:59 - heavy right now and I think
47:00 - unnecessarily so trying to cut down on
47:03 - that just making things look a lot more
47:05 - clean I mean you all kind of probably
47:07 - know my style by now that I like things
47:09 - to be really clean minimal but here's
47:14 - the thing though that's going to be
47:16 - on project because it's already built
47:20 - using a content management system called
47:22 - Ektron which is dotnet framework based
47:27 - so I'm gonna be working in like C sharp
47:33 - like dotnet templates and stuff and I'm
47:38 - gonna be working with just straight like
47:40 - HTML CSS it's going to be really
47:44 - different than what I've done before so
47:45 - I'm actually I'm a little bit nervous I
47:48 - don't know if that how well that would
47:49 - go down but that's probably going to be
47:51 - first priority for the month of
47:54 - September if there's some if there's
47:59 - some other way that I could do a project
48:01 - and just spend like an hour a day on
48:03 - this project when I did the stream and
48:05 - then the rest of the day I can work on
48:06 - the main web site that might be possible
48:08 - as well but I'd like to know what you
48:12 - all think I mean if you'd like to switch
48:15 - it up and do something that's not react
48:16 - and instead do something that's like
48:18 - dotnet I mean that's that's fine with me
48:21 - I just want to make sure that if it's
48:25 - possible for me to do something that's
48:27 - more relevant to you all then I'd like
48:29 - to do it you know obviously it's not
48:31 - completely in my control because I got
48:33 - to work on whatever you know my boss
48:35 - tells me to work on but within that the
48:37 - freedom that I have on my projects I'd
48:41 - like to show you all what you want to
48:43 - see so anyway let me know about that my
48:46 - 5 minutes is up for this for this
48:53 - session I'm going to start another
48:54 - Pomodoro session right now and then I'll
48:56 - get through the rest of the live chat I
48:57 - realized I didn't get through that much
48:59 - of it so I'll just have to get through
49:01 - some more on the next time but anyway
49:05 - let me know think about it and let me
49:07 - know the only other project that I
49:09 - probably could work on is I have I have
49:15 - to work with Salesforce so there's like
49:19 - an application that we have for students
49:22 - who are interested in coming here they
49:23 - want to apply to go here that's all
49:26 - built through Salesforce and they have I
49:28 - think it's called like eight
49:30 - basically it's it's kind of like their
49:33 - templating system it was described to me
49:38 - is like some somewhat like JavaScript
49:42 - I'm not really sure that I don't really
49:44 - know if the person on the phone
49:45 - describing this was a developer or if
49:49 - they were sales so I don't really know
49:51 - how accurate this is but basically there
49:53 - was something that Salesforce uses
49:55 - that's they sold me if you know
49:57 - JavaScript you'll be able to do this so
50:01 - I don't know a lot about it but I know
50:02 - it's gonna be mostly CSS stuff
50:05 - occasionally maybe I'll go in and change
50:07 - some of the templates but to be honest
50:09 - with you right now I was checking out
50:10 - earlier today and I don't even know
50:12 - where to find the template so I'm gonna
50:14 - need to do some more research on that
50:16 - that's also going to be kind of a weird
50:18 - project where I'm going to be working
50:21 - kind of inside this other system to try
50:25 - to do it you know I won't be able to set
50:27 - it up exactly like I want to I'll just
50:28 - have to kind of work with what's there
50:30 - and change it so anyway so just let me
50:34 - know what you all think about those
50:35 - projects if you're interested in
50:36 - anything or you know any other ideas for
50:41 - now though I'm gonna go back and do some
50:46 - work I just not realized I had this
50:48 - still up on the screen I wonder if
50:49 - anybody just tuned in and like saw these
50:51 - really what what is going on with change
50:54 - of this project how I covered that up
51:00 - and it means you alright so let's do
51:01 - another Pomodoro session let's see
51:03 - what's next up on here so fix the
51:05 - checkbox
51:06 - all right let's fix this one I already
51:09 - showed you a little bit earlier what was
51:10 - wrong with it I can show you again in
51:12 - case you didn't see it before but check
51:16 - check this one out in that icon when we
51:21 - move over it overlaps
51:22 - all right that's that's no good it also
51:24 - overlaps at another point here so
51:31 - we need to fix that and I may have to
51:35 - just come up with some other way to
51:36 - position this other than what we're
51:39 - doing now and I'll show you what we're
51:42 - what we're doing with it okay so that
51:47 - checkbox now I've made its own component
51:50 - and I just call it an icon checkbox so
51:54 - if you are following along with what
51:55 - we're doing on github that's in the
51:58 - components folder you can look at ICON
52:02 - checkbox j/s and that's where we're at
52:04 - so right now I just have some inline
52:06 - Styles on that and or actually just
52:10 - position positioning this with absolute
52:13 - positioning so it shouldn't have been
52:16 - that much a surprise to me whatever the
52:19 - positioning was messed up usually when
52:22 - you try to use absolute positioning like
52:23 - that and you want your site to be
52:26 - responsive it doesn't work quite like
52:28 - you wanted to
52:29 - unless you're positioning something like
52:31 - in the in the corners usually the
52:34 - corners worked fine but things in the
52:36 - middle of the page don't work out at
52:39 - least that's been my experience so I'm
52:43 - thinking there's we could either do two
52:44 - things I could try to work with the
52:46 - existing breakpoints and change these
52:48 - values based on that I'm not really
52:54 - excited about doing that that just seems
52:58 - like it doesn't seem to me like the best
53:01 - solution the other solution would be to
53:04 - not use absolute positioning try to use
53:07 - try to do it some other way so that it
53:10 - wouldn't matter at all what the screen
53:11 - size is it's always gonna be at the end
53:15 - of that line so let's um let's see what
53:21 - we can do let's mess around with it here
53:23 - in dev tools a bit and I mean maybe
53:27 - we'll have to change the mark-up it will
53:30 - change how I was working in the in HTML
53:35 - somebody's just zoom in a bit so we can
53:38 - see and I can move this off to the side
53:40 - here
53:42 - let's make it there we go
53:46 - so there's the overlap so I mean
53:51 - obviously we could like I said we could
53:53 - just shift it around but here's here's
54:01 - what I don't think that'll work
54:04 - it's not a good solution also because I
54:07 - want to keep this component reusable
54:09 - right so there could be it could just
54:12 - say photography in that case the way
54:14 - we're positioning and now it might not
54:15 - be a bad thing we'll just shift the
54:18 - positioner on but also it could be
54:23 - really long so I guess what we want then
54:27 - is we wanted always to appear at the end
54:33 - and I suppose even wrap this wrap around
54:39 - it does yeah so even if this wrapped
54:42 - around I guess we would still wanted to
54:43 - appear at the end it won't look great
54:47 - but better that's better than
54:48 - overlapping the only other way that I
54:53 - can think of changing it that I know for
54:56 - sure would work all the time I guess
54:58 - would be to move the icon to the
55:00 - beginning but I don't really think that
55:02 - would look I don't think that would look
55:05 - right I guess we could try it but let's
55:09 - see if we can do it a different way and
55:10 - then as as a last resort we could
55:13 - probably just move this up here and then
55:15 - we'll know that it'll always work
55:16 - because it'll be right at the beginning
55:22 - excuse me sad too heady on okay
55:44 - all right so let's see
55:53 - I think our problem
56:06 - yeah let's go back to here and let me
56:08 - show you so the problem before that we
56:12 - were having was that I was trying to put
56:15 - this checkbox or this icon inside the
56:22 - the label right so I was trying to pass
56:25 - that in as a prop so basically the the
56:34 - text with an SVG in line I was going to
56:40 - pass it all in and I think we're having
56:44 - trouble with that and then I think it
56:51 - was I think of the Sebastian submitted a
56:53 - pull request where he came up with doing
56:57 - it away similar to this and then I
57:01 - changed it a bit turned it into its own
57:03 - component and then switched to this
57:06 - style of positioning so I kind of
57:15 - figured I mean ideally I would be able
57:17 - to pass it all in here I but I guess I
57:21 - have to be honest with you I can't even
57:22 - remember I'd have to go back and watch
57:23 - the video you did this I can't remember
57:25 - if it just totally failed and it
57:28 - wouldn't work at all or for it just
57:32 - wasn't working exactly how we wanted it
57:35 - to
57:48 - see but in any case that's why we we
57:52 - have these separated out so then you see
57:54 - when it comes out you know here there's
57:59 - this whole container div you know with
58:03 - all this stuff in here and then next to
58:07 - that we have this other div that has our
58:11 - image
58:28 - display table
58:39 - that's interesting
58:48 - let's mess around here's what I'm
58:50 - thinking right now what if we could take
58:54 - these two container divs and have them
58:56 - display side-by-side
59:17 - alright let's just I'm just gonna mess
59:20 - around a little bit here just with some
59:29 - of these properties and see what we get
59:37 - I need to reset some of this
59:47 - position of my getting
59:56 - with this to be actually let's get rid
59:59 - of a lot of this stuff
60:16 - when it comes to this kind of thing
60:17 - that's just okay I don't mind that now
60:26 - we may still have the same problem we
60:28 - get that's it okay I guess not
60:35 - this might just might not be a bad way
60:41 - to fix it if I can get them both on the
60:42 - same line
60:58 - okay
61:22 - all right I think I'm gonna check I have
61:25 - an idea but I'm gonna check the live
61:26 - chat first see if you all have a better
61:28 - idea
61:29 - oh okay just saw one there we go thank
61:36 - you
61:36 - who's that Carlos Carlos thank you so
61:39 - much that's exactly what the problem was
61:42 - all right for a second there I thought I
61:44 - forgot how CSS works I had with a
61:48 - hundred percent that's why all this
61:50 - stuff I was going with position and
61:53 - floats we're not working awesome okay so
61:56 - let's try this out we're just gonna move
62:00 - it back and forth of bed okay not mmm
62:08 - not terrible let's get rid of this float
62:15 - all right that's better
62:21 - yeah I kind of like that better we just
62:26 - did
62:36 - oh yes
62:40 - I like that better
62:55 - okay this is what I'd so here's a tip
62:59 - you probably already know this but if
63:01 - you want to make your screen even
63:03 - smaller than it already is
63:05 - just make your console dock or your dev
63:08 - tools docked and then you can shrink it
63:10 - down really small like smaller than
63:11 - normal I wanted to do this just to see
63:15 - obviously not no one's ever gonna be
63:17 - looking at it like that but I just
63:20 - wanted to see what would happen if we if
63:22 - this went on to another line mm-hmm okay
63:32 - not bad let's just give this a lot more
63:36 - text and see what happens
63:52 - there we go
63:55 - oops
64:04 - yeah okay
64:15 - it looks like it it's not bad like this
64:21 - but once we get down smaller then it's
64:32 - not great
64:38 - I guess I'm okay with it for now since
64:41 - we I think this is the longest one that
64:46 - we have yeah I'm okay with it
64:51 - it's not perfect but for our use case
64:54 - right now it definitely works if we end
64:57 - up getting longer ones that need that
65:01 - need this then then I can worry about
65:05 - that at that point okay
65:15 - let's see
65:24 - anyway Hamza says you won't be going
65:27 - smaller than 320 pixels with ya for sure
65:31 - the only reason I wanted to go smaller
65:32 - was I just wanted to see like let's say
65:38 - we had something that was really long I
65:40 - just want to try to simulate what would
65:41 - happen and then after I thought well why
65:43 - don't I just put the text in there so
65:45 - that's why I was this was a better way
65:48 - to do it just adding more text
65:50 - originally I just didn't think about
65:52 - that but you're right yeah nothing's no
65:55 - screen that I know of is smaller than
65:57 - 320 pixels and with all right so let's
66:02 - just do this in our code so you end up
66:09 - having this div
66:20 - well
66:26 - and my mind block should work yeah
66:48 - okay
67:05 - I'm gonna have to get to that div with
67:14 - with this CSS there's no
67:28 - I don't think there's any way just rush
67:41 - I wonder which style I'm passing down
67:44 - let's check out our service request
67:50 - let's find our checkboxes style star
67:55 - checkbox it's trying to track down where
68:02 - our styles are here we go okay so we do
68:09 - have checkboxes here let's see what that
68:11 - margin bottoms being applied here great
68:19 - okay so whatever we put there with our
68:23 - margin bottom should work should be fine
68:26 - [Music]
68:27 - we don't want we don't want with 100%
68:30 - let's go with with Auto ok Auto words
68:40 - so the width auto float:left and I guess
68:48 - we'll do this I can't remember with the
68:50 - default display was an English blog so
68:53 - we'll do display:inline-block with Auto
68:55 - float:left
69:20 - alright forget that one down and now
69:25 - this next one whoa
69:30 - okay that was definitely not the right
69:32 - thing to do what did I do
69:35 - all right let's see
70:00 - is it the float
70:07 - I was further with
70:19 - maybe
70:34 - that's odd
70:36 - I don't think I change anything else
70:38 - let's see
70:47 - all right let's let's get rid of these
70:51 - for now
71:00 - let's see what we had okay so if it was
71:03 - display table before
71:35 - mm-hmm all right and they like to think
71:38 - about something different all right I
71:44 - was checking the live chat to see if I
71:48 - missed anything
72:03 - okay all right
72:11 - let's see what it
72:17 - yeah let me see
72:31 - that this week this
72:46 - okay
73:07 - maybe if I move this styles into I could
73:16 - maybe try to move this into our icon
73:19 - check box component and then depending
73:24 - on whether or not there's an icon I can
73:26 - have different styles
73:42 - that works
73:46 - yeah I guess first I did I just need to
73:49 - test see if I could do this twice on two
73:54 - different checkboxes I'm guessing that
73:56 - it wouldn't work it like let's say I did
73:58 - it on two different checkboxes right
73:59 - next to each other and have the same
74:01 - weird stuff happening so I guess it
74:05 - wouldn't matter either way
74:47 - let's see if I can
75:15 - I've never seen this max content min
75:18 - content before I want to try to keep
75:28 - this display table now and then set the
75:32 - width Auto and see what happens
75:35 - maybe I'll have a different result than
75:37 - I did before
75:39 - what was that I'm just gonna not set the
75:43 - display
75:52 - now that that was the width thing ice I
75:56 - guess is what the problem is
76:13 - we got to give it some sort of with I
76:15 - guess alright let's let's do let's give
76:25 - it a hundred percent with but minus the
76:28 - width of the icon so let's see how how
76:31 - big our icon is
76:40 - so icon yeah
76:45 - so like 24 pixels it's just the Sade
76:49 - let's give it 25 so let's let's give our
76:52 - with 100% - 25 pixels see what that does
77:13 - okay better now
77:23 - now we can do this
77:50 - why is it going all the way up there
78:26 - okay
79:21 - okay thank you know live jet okay
79:26 - flexstretch is with my default a place
79:29 - automatically without any descending
79:30 - with
79:31 - [Music]
79:37 - all right eyes huh good some said said
79:42 - what's this sorcery in the in the hole
79:45 - I've said
79:47 - yeah it's yes okay so John Hanson is
79:51 - saying we can use flex display flex and
79:54 - then justify content space between
79:57 - alright let's try that out because I I'm
80:02 - thinking like I ain't hurtin Lee did
80:03 - something right me I don't know why this
80:06 - is now appearing way up at the top I'm
80:11 - trying to do it over here because I
80:21 - floated everything left
81:02 - interesting
81:14 - there we go
81:33 - and
81:38 - see
82:20 - all right let me try out this
82:28 - I want to show off this flex thing that
82:30 - John's talking about but basically we I
82:37 - thought this might end up being tricky
82:39 - because I remember when I messed with it
82:41 - last time it was it was a little bit
82:44 - tricky which is why I end up going with
82:45 - what I did
82:47 - alright so John's saying dude display
82:50 - flex and then justified content space
82:52 - between so flex
83:11 - so are we putting it on here then let's
83:16 - try it up
83:35 - oops
83:46 - whoa
83:58 - okay
84:29 - all right let me see whoa all right I
84:32 - lost track of time a bit let's let's
84:41 - stop here so I can get to some questions
84:45 - and then I have to get to my appointment
84:48 - and let me let me check let me scroll up
84:58 - now but to get to the last place where I
85:01 - left off in the live chat so sorry we're
85:03 - not gonna be able to finish this right
85:05 - now I feel like we're really close it's
85:10 - just a matter of figuring out what the
85:12 - best way is that that is going to work
85:14 - for the screen sizes I think we have
85:16 - maybe at least two possible solutions
85:19 - that that I can think of right now that
85:22 - will work I'll just have to finish those
85:27 - up tomorrow I need to check I need to
85:31 - check on traffic though to make sure I
85:36 - can get to my appointment on time
85:39 - because they're doing construction on
85:42 - the highway on the way there so alright
85:48 - it's telling me okay it'sit's it looks
85:55 - like traffic's not bad right now so I
85:58 - should be able to answer some questions
86:00 - and still be alright to get there
86:11 - let's see
86:25 - it's trying to find where I left off
86:31 - okay I think I found it yeah it's the
86:36 - last thing we were talking about was
86:38 - what the next project would be okay so
86:47 - I'm ash asked about a quick briefing on
86:51 - what I'm building so ash not sure if
86:53 - you're still watching but I guess I can
86:56 - quick click update for Astra for anyone
87:00 - else that's watching and wasn't sure
87:02 - what we're building this is just a react
87:05 - react site that allows users to submit
87:11 - requests and upload files and then those
87:15 - get sent to a project management system
87:17 - through their API and the files get
87:20 - uploaded to our server which we're
87:23 - running a droplet on digitalocean
87:24 - with node and nginx is a reverse proxy
87:29 - and users can also just get some other
87:32 - resources and some basic information
87:34 - download some images so it's not really
87:40 - that involved probably the the most
87:41 - complicated thing we're doing here is
87:44 - handling file uploads and form data
88:06 - okay so at some point nova glow had said
88:10 - but aren't you only doing client-side
88:12 - editing the moment you refresh the pager
88:13 - where it goes away yes that's true and
88:16 - it looks like no glow got some answers
88:19 - as well but I'll explain this just in
88:20 - case anyone else is having that that
88:22 - can't see the live chat I was thinking
88:24 - the same thing when you edit things in
88:27 - dev tools yes they're not by default
88:31 - they're not permanent you can set it up
88:32 - so that your project files actually can
88:35 - be edited through dev tools it's really
88:38 - cool I just never took the time to set
88:40 - that up but for now it's just a really
88:42 - fast way to see what's going on make
88:47 - some changes and I don't like to do a
88:50 - lot I don't like to do more than I can
88:53 - remember
88:53 - because then you're right if you refresh
88:56 - the page then you lose it all so I like
88:58 - to do a little bit see if it works and
89:01 - then transfer it over to my files and
89:04 - then kind of go back and forth like that
89:17 - I just uh-huh um so just says what I see
89:21 - your face yes if you can see my face
89:28 - it's kind of odd if I keep doing it like
89:31 - this I might I might switch and get a
89:34 - different camera I'm just using the
89:35 - built-in camera on an iMac and the angle
89:39 - is weird like I just feel like it keeps
89:41 - getting a shot of my forehead all the
89:43 - time and you can't really see my facial
89:46 - expressions so I think it would be
89:48 - better if the camera angle were a little
89:50 - bit lower so I don't know maybe I'll
89:54 - keep a lookout for any webcams that are
89:57 - on sale rude rude rang Shu says can
90:06 - anyone recommend me one of among the
90:10 - following so amber Jas Orillia Jas and
90:13 - polymer Jas I'm sorry I don't have
90:17 - experience with those I mean I I know
90:19 - what they are
90:20 - I've read about them but I don't have
90:22 - hands-on experience I don't really feel
90:23 - qualified to make a recommendation so
90:26 - hopefully there are some other people in
90:28 - the live chat that can can recommend
90:30 - something to you
90:31 - oh cool Blake said said hey I like the
90:37 - face preview awesome cool maybe oh uh
90:40 - maybe I'll keep it as long as I was
90:42 - afraid it would block too much of the
90:44 - code but it didn't seem to be a problem
90:45 - so as long as it's not a problem I'm
90:48 - fine with with leaving it there okay
90:57 - see Daryl asks react native versus
91:01 - PhoneGap and got a suggestion to use
91:05 - react native from word rang shoo yeah I
91:08 - um I also recommend react native all
91:12 - right I got to answer the door so I'll
91:15 - be right back
91:29 - okay yeah I recommend react native as
91:33 - low I phone gaps been around for a while
91:38 - and I don't have personal experience
91:41 - with react native yet I will soon but
91:46 - from what I've from what I've read about
91:49 - it if I had to say I'd say good with
91:51 - react native but like I said I don't
91:53 - have hands-on experience with it
92:08 - okay so it'sit's Brean so earlier I'd
92:12 - asked for clarification on how to
92:14 - pronounce a name so it's is it is it
92:19 - Bria no Driscoll is that it let me know
92:24 - if that's I'm pretty sure that's what
92:27 - that's what is supposed to be okay I was
92:32 - I was talking about editors earlier and
92:36 - Nova blow says Emacs is better than them
92:41 - Patrick says Emacs evil mode is better
92:44 - than Emacs I don't know what that is
92:55 - oh and brains of M user as well cool
93:18 - çf coder - says what responds to the
93:21 - framework are you using doesn't appear
93:23 - to be bootstrap it's material UI but
93:34 - Bharat says so is there any project on
93:37 - Salesforce you'll be working on yeah
93:39 - actually I do have something that I need
93:41 - to I'm gonna work on in Salesforce so
93:45 - maybe I'll be doing that on the the
93:48 - livestream I'm not sure yet we'll see I
93:52 - don't know we'll see how it goes I still
93:55 - haven't decided what project I'd like to
93:58 - try to stick with the project I mean I
94:00 - could bounce back and forth and do like
94:01 - two different projects at once but I
94:03 - don't want it to be confusing I mean I
94:06 - could I could put them a different
94:07 - playlist name them you know different
94:09 - things but I'm undecided yet as to
94:13 - exactly what the next project will be
94:34 - okay all right I'm kind of going through
94:37 - a lot and just looking for any questions
94:40 - especially from new people because I'm
94:42 - gonna have to leave here in just a
94:43 - minute
95:09 - okay
95:24 - all right so I'm gonna end with this
95:28 - John Hanson said I could put a green
95:30 - screen behind me so that my background
95:32 - would be transparent you just see me act
95:35 - that would be really cool I but I don't
95:38 - know about having a green screen in my
95:40 - office yet we have a video studio that's
95:43 - it's actually right on the other side of
95:45 - the wall from my office and there's a
95:49 - huge green screen that they use in there
95:52 - but they're always filming something in
95:56 - there so I don't think they'd let me do
95:58 - my streams in there I don't know I'll
96:01 - see maybe they have some leftover green
96:03 - green stuff that I can hang that would
96:06 - be fun all right well I got a oh
96:16 - actually here's one more question
96:17 - Hamza said have you watched noob cat on
96:20 - Twitch I haven't watched her live yet I
96:24 - didn't I didn't get a chance we I talked
96:28 - to her on Twitter before which was
96:30 - really cool she she had written an
96:35 - article about live-streaming and I let
96:37 - her know how helpful that was for me and
96:40 - it was really who she was really
96:42 - encouraging for my stream and said said
96:46 - nice things about it so I really want to
96:48 - be able to watch her live at some point
96:49 - I'm just the time for me just doesn't
96:52 - work out but anyway I think from a
96:58 - little bit that I've seen in the stream
96:59 - it's awesome so alright so I gotta take
97:05 - off I got a good two to an appointment
97:07 - now and thanks for watching
97:09 - I really kind of hoped we'd get more
97:11 - done I really I actually really wanted
97:14 - to like combine the sass files and
97:16 - organize them a bit but it just didn't
97:18 - didn't work out today so I'll be back
97:23 - tomorrow assuming my wife doesn't get
97:26 - any worse and then I might have to take
97:28 - a day off and take care of the kids but
97:32 - otherwise I should be back tomorrow and
97:34 - thank you so much for watching in for
97:36 - all your help
97:37 - I really appreciate it and have a great
97:39 - day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody is Jessie and I hope everyone had a have a good weekend I spent all most of my weekend on on a redux reactor Redux project so I think I'm finally getting the hang of Redux which is awesome so hopefully there'll be a Redux project for the live streams sometime soon so trying to figure out what the next project will be after this one which we're almost finished with and I think I've realized that I'm actually not that at Redux but I'm bad at spelling so that's he could be more of my problem when I was trying to debug some of the stuff that I've been working on I kept thinking I wasn't I didn't understand Redux but it wasn't that it was mostly just typos alright so today's gonna be we're gonna do about an hour long stream so I have an appointment coming up a little bit later on also just a heads up if my wife calls I'm gonna have to answer it because she's not feeling well and she might need help with the kids so I might have to end the stream earlier so hopefully that doesn't happen and she's feeling alright but I it maybe an abrupt ending here so before we get started with any code a couple things I want to show you one is a bow wrote an article in medium free code camps medium about how to contribute to the YouTube channel so if you're interested in contributing in some way check this out and really useful stuff on there so actually as I was reading through this I was reading about you know what he said about having a video of of myself on the on the screen so if you notice today I do have video of myself on the screen so I try to make it as small as possible it wouldn't cover up a lot of the code I'll try this out I figure it's worth the shot and it's it's not like it it's really any extra work once it's set up the video just appears so oops I think I accidentally clicked on something but anyway I just wanted to share that with you there's a lot of different ways that you can contribute if you want to like captioning and things like that or even creating your own videos so check that out if you have a chance also wanted to just do something fun since we're kind of at the end of this project I thought it would be cool to go back and look at where we started or actually where I started so I want to show you let's start with this first so about two years ago almost two years ago this was I took the screenshot on October 10th 2015 I'm sorry October 14th 2015 this was the very first version of the Resource Center and this version never actually went live like this they were obviously a lot of changes but this was the home page so you can see some of the stuff is similar we still have a lot of the you know same options and everything the side menu was just these these buttons so when you click this it just brought the buttons in and out so definitely that's probably the biggest change other than the colors we also had the look here's the logo page so the logo page is a little bit different we had this this side instead of every all the options being at the top I had them down the side service request form similar we actually had to split onto two pages and it still had you know the cool checkbox effect that that I liked and we had the material designs style inputs also you can see definitely changed up the color scheme a bit this is a little bit heavy with the gold color here but but just be cool to kind of see where we came from and I definitely learned how to better utilize these action buttons he's floating action buttons for material design and I learned that you shouldn't have a million of them on the page just one also here's some sketch mockups that I had done as well so you could see some alternate designs that I thought of doing so here's one this was in response to some feedback that said well people might not even know that you can click in these areas right because they just have the line so I added this kind of darker background color we I used some of the alternate colors so here's that that yellow color that we've been using as an accent color but as the primary color this time with kind of actual outlines around the the fields in the same way just a little bit different this is actually somewhat close in color scheme to what we use now is you know just this yellow is the accent color here's an old green and white and here's lots of gold and then here's a blue color that's in our color palette so actually here's the I don't think I've used this on any projects on the stream but here's the dark blue and the light blue that are also in the color palette and then this is just another alternate so anyway this is sketched by the way if you're not if you haven't seen this before it's it's a cool program to just do like mockups and stuff with designs I don't I don't use it often usually just at the beginning of a project sometimes if I need to show show someone what I'm thinking and have it be a little bit better than me just trying to draw it on a piece of paper then I do it like that but anyway I found those I had those at screenshots still saved on my desktop so I just thought it'd be cool to check them out all right so let me check out the live chat and say hi to everybody before we get started let's see someone asked sorry I can't read the name but it says hi who can recommend SF SFTP / STP plugin for atom like SFTP for sublime I'm sorry I don't have I I don't know of any plugins like that I've never used any plugins for atom but maybe someone else in the live chat I may know about it peyt hey chase says hi from South Africa hey how's it going thanks for watching they have someone from India awesome thanks I I'm on says I'm too chatty yeah no I'm no I'm too chatty let's see all right cool let me get started oh cool yeah dispute some more shout outs from where we were when we said hello from Israel from Ireland awesome I'm gonna get started shriek ah s is this project towards the end yes yes it's it's almost finished really probably any day now we'll be we'll be done with it at this point I'm just kind of waiting for feedback of the official like yes this is fine we can launch this and then we'll be done we might actually start a new project before this launches because I don't want to be waiting for feedback and just doing little updates like even to be honest with you today's stream I was having trouble coming up with a title and a topic for it because there's not that much left to do so we're really gonna be I'll show you my my Trello board this is we're gonna work on today there's something there's kind of a weird thing going on with the cursor when we move over the upload button so we're going to try to fix that on small screens that icon that information icon we have on at this point only one of our check boxes overlaps the text so we need to fix that as well and then if we have time we need to fix the spacing between some elements in the form it's just it's not uniform so but you can see we're getting down to some things that are just I mean they're definitely I want to fix but they're not really like super important so so we may end up just moving on to the next project and then you know maybe I'll come back to this if something major needs to be changed but if we can get these three things accomplished I'll be happy actually if we can just get the first two accomplished in this stream I'll be fine with that let's see so let's go let me show you what the first thing is so we can get started on it I'm going to start my Pomodoro timer and we're gonna do 25 minutes of coding and then five minutes I'll go back to the live chat and answer any questions you have we'll probably do two sessions like that two 25minute sessions and then I'll I'll answer any questions you have before I end the stream so today we'll just do two sessions since I have an appointment a little bit later on see okay so here's what's what the problem is so you can see the cursor turns into the you know the pointer that's let's you know something's clickable but then once you get to the middle it changes and then it goes back so there's this whole area right in the middle right that huh interesting yes so there's there's a large area not not exactly in the middle right it's more like it starts here and goes all the way out so we just I just want to fix that it's probably going to mean easy fix I hope it's gonna be an easy fix but I just happened to see it at some point last week and figured you know may as well this will change it so I want to try to look at first and see what what is that element this has got to be something hmm button so I'm using of course dev tools Reggie this is just chrome dev tools with the dark theme on here and I'm just kind of going through the elements here trying to figure out really I was trying to see if there's some element that had that basic shape that we were seeing here with the with the cursors that we could see the change I'm not seeing anything with exactly that shape I do want to see what do we have with cursorpointer on it right now so we have that has the cursor pointer on it so let's change that let's see where that's at let's remove it and see okay so that didn't really affect interesting let's see if we put it on here as well no we don't have it on there okay cursor points are we have it on this span let's take that off mm interesting so I'm going through right now and just kind of removing it and it's interesting that there's been no change really cursorpointer okay I'm guessing that this is gonna be the one that really there we go okay so that's the one that we're really getting the the pointer from that's interesting all right so I'm gonna bring this back so it's interesting that it works but then there's something here we've already seen that these two had cursorpointer on them as well now let's go in here and see oh yeah ah so I'm not seeing it not seeing anything else here this is all oh yeah interesting what I'm going to check now then since I couldn't find anything here obviously in this div that would be coming over top of that I'm gonna check this div over here and I'll probably check this one as well I just you know what let me I'd like to change the screen size a bit and see if that makes a difference because I think that'll give me a clue as to where this is coming from if we can find it oops okay so it's still happening okay well that's interesting I was hoping it would be different on a smaller screen and then that would that would point me in the right direction here but it's not while we're here on the small screen you can see that this is that that icon that's overlapping so it should be out here but when we get down smaller it it overlaps we need to fix that as well I'll open this up a little bit again and now now after seeing what I did on a small screen I don't think we're gonna have any any luck by going to these other divs because the order since the order of everything kind of changed so this is above it you know and this one's on the side but then this one ends up being two above it and this one is above it there's nothing on the side I don't think there's anything in those dips so I'm not even going to check because that's um you know probably about 95% sure there's gonna be a waste of time at this point so I think I'd like to try putting cursorpointer on this container because there doesn't seem to be any real reason why it couldn't be because I if you click if I click this I don't even necessarily want it to where you could just click and potentially I mean I think I have it yeah you can't type in there but it looks like you could when you click it so I don't think I want it like that anyway so let's make this whole thing actually just on this one Hershey's who here let's see if we can mmm no it's the same same problem here interesting hmm I just happened to look over at the live chat again Cronus says hello from Miami Florida I'm stuck in my room upstairs wow that's that's pretty crazy how so are you safe there I know they have if you just in case you don't know Florida is getting hit with these huge hurricanes like right more it's pretty bad so I've seen pictures and video down there so I hope you're alright and you're safe down there where you're at Wow is it is it really bad in Miami right now okay coding and caffeine said maybe the zindex that's a good idea I was thinking about that earlier and then I forgotten okay yeah let's check some zindex stuff here yeah the input should actually have the interesting there we go there we go check this out this is our area where we're having the the problem right here where this says choose files so that's a problem that's a problem right there so if we couldn't see it all right so let's as long as we can move this out of the way and get rid of it somehow we should be fine let's try to change the Z index let's go this should fix it yep it does mmhmm but now we can't upload so that's no good all right so we need okay so there was something I can't remember what the property is let me think about this I use this on a project within the last few months essentially what what I'm thinking is there was some sort of property where I could pass through the clique basically through to an element that's below and maybe I'm maybe I'm remembering this wrong but I thought there was a way that I could do that essentially what I'm thinking of doing is setting this E and X back farther but then having to see what it was called let me see if anybody pointer events there we go I was thinking click events thank you John Hanson in the live chat just just put it in there thank you so much yeah so it's pointer events let's let's try this so let's put that Z index back on here now we have so we have some stuff over top of it that we want to set the pointer events let me do this just wanna do none here and then below see now I it's been too long since I've used this I can't I can't remember how this may be we have to put this one has to have four events no that's not it okay I have a link wearing shoe put a link in the live chat and so let me check this out I'd rather so I haven't looked at this yet but it says talking about styling styling inputs I don't want to I really don't want to get into styling like too much because I mean we already have the styles in here all right let me check out the live chat now because it seems like you all are putting a lot of advice in here so just thinking so embarrassed I was thinking of a way to change the div dot button label for upload try that positionabsolute was the index for one okay let's we could play with the zindex a bit and see if we could get it let's try all right now I have cursorpointer on here but it's not working on it's not working on it I wonder if there's any way to force it to work probably not yeah I guess yeah I kind of don't want to do it like this but this is probably gonna be the way to go what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put actually now I don't know if I can that's all should be on the upper layer of the C index item was a background on okay John John Hanson was giving me some advice on these pointer events let's see you should use a label before linking it to the file input okay I'm getting I'm getting two different sets of advice in the in the the live chat so let me let me pick one we'll try that out and see if it works now I've gotten a third or fourth okay I have quite a few different different paths here so I'm gonna try the simplest first and then if it doesn't work I'll move on and go down down the list okay so I'll do my best to describe what what each one is alright so it looks like the simplest suggestion to try would just be let's go back to here appearance none okay not working yes okay so that did not work I jarvez suggested that thank you for the suggestion let me know if I did I implemented that wrong but right now it's not working okay I'll move on to let's let's try this label so the next suggestion is make a label for the for the file for the input so let's try this so let me see if I can I assume that I guess I shouldn't assume it but I was assuming that one of these also has a label on here but I guess not oh well here we go but is this even doing it alright let's put this so is it possible whoops and the four the four goes with the name correct and not the alright not working good okay I'm bear to assist it does get with the ID all right I wasn't sure it's one of those things that I really I rarely do this on like by hand you know there's always some sort of framework or you just copy and paste the examples so it's been it's been quite a while feel like the only time I actually do this form inputs by hand as if I'm doing like tutorial exercises or something okay Fars ID okay all right let me try this looks like you need a label not a div yeah that's what I was thinking haha Robin says so is being a developer copy and paste not exactly it doesn't vote copy and pasting but that's not all alright let's see in class button alright let's take this off of here for now let's make those a whole nice okay so that works definitely want to okay great alright so that works now I wanted it to be so that if you clicked over here you could also upload so let's just try to put that over here yeah let's try to change that make this the label instead and see if we can get that to work mmm now it looks like that's not working let's see oh okay so when I change this to label it definitely changed some of what was going on here so let's see okay all right well at least we have the fullwidth but it's still hey there we go so it is if you saw that so I did click out here somewhere and it worked there you go so basically we have this this kind of covering things up right now so let's yeah let's go all right Susie index is not working for that now let's see see if we can go back to our pointer events all right great and let's make sure it's awesome okay so that works so my my timer just went off as well so this is good timing so let me just explain what what ended up working so we we made a label of this div here that was basically just a container div that span this entire area so we turn this into a label with a four attribute that matched the ID of our input right so that's big I mean that's nothing really groundbreaking right that's just like basic HTML how this works right you click the label and it activates the input so we did that we made sure that we put cursorpointer on this so that we got that that cursor everywhere the problem was that this was acting like a like a text area which we don't want to act exactly like a text area we don't want it to seem like you could click in there and type we wanted when you click on this for the file upload to be activated so we had to go down here to where this wrapper is for that for that text area and there we added our pointer events none so we actually ended up combining several of approaches that you all suggested in the live chat which is pretty cool and it all worked so now so far we've only done this in dev tools so let me go over to the actual code and do this and then I'll do my five minutes of answer questions in the live chat I just don't want to forget this in the five minutes that I answer questions so let's go over to the code and change this so our service requests thought I had a service request for them open here there we go so it is open here let's see where upload is here we go okay so this was what we turned into a label let's make this a label who's that there we go all right so there's our label we also needed to change this there we go we needed to change this to displayblock because when we added the label then it was no longer displayblock so we needed that we need to we need to add the upload nor the before okay upload so that's it through for this area right foot didn't we need to put cursorpointer I think we did let's do that as well there's a pointer and down here for a file path wrapper okay we already have it here for a file path wrapper we need to do pointer events none all right let's try that out save that and we'll save that and let's just give it a hard refresh make sure you clear out everything here in dev tools okay so let's whoops oops I forgot we needed to put make the zindex for this input nothing we had a negative one so if we go file field I think this is the only input so I think we're safe to just say input here there we go okay so now we have our pointer over this whole thing we click it great we get that let's awesome alright cool so mission accomplished on that one and that took it did take a little over one Pomodoro session but since I was trying to narrate what I was doing at the same time I think we'll leave it at one all right great let me turn on my fiveminute timer and I'm gonna go through the live chat and see what what questions you all have see all right so I'm going all the way up to the top taught tough fix it says wish your wife quick recovery thank you so much I if you weren't here at the beginning I mentioned that my wife's not feeling well so I may have to if she needs me I may have to end the stream and go help out with the kids but so far so good but thank you I appreciate you saying that Mau Mau Russa says you guys are awesome thank you I appreciate that oh cool I can't I'm sorry so I remember having trouble with this name last time because it's not I wanted to say Brian but I don't think it was Brian Bri a I and I'm really sorry I usually can remember but this one I couldn't remember so let me know what let me know how it was I know I eventually got it right so please let me know how to pronounce that properly I don't want to mess it up anymore but anyway he said I liked the last examples of the sketch mockups I don't remember what the last one was let me see okay so I'm guessing it's it's this one the last example with all the colors so cool thanks yeah I kind of I thought it was cool I actually think it would be cool to do to have like a little Easter Egg in the in the the site somewhere to where you could just change the colors up so it wouldn't really be that obvious that you could do it but if you if you searched around enough you'd be able to toggle all the colors that'd be cool if I had a lot of time if maybe I would do that Shandra asks which text editor do you recommend I use plugins for code editor I use atom and I would recommend atom I like it but I also like Visual Studio code so those two I have actually used and would recommend I can't personally recommend anything else because I haven't really there's nothing else that I've used in really light but I have heard that sublime is is pretty good and for people who know them it's really cool and they they really like it I when I see people use them I'm always really impressed with it but the learning curves a little bit higher than something like like atom sublime notice we have Marcus it's a loaf from Serbia hey how's it going Nova blue asked what editor are you using I'm using Adam Srikant says we'll ask the new project also be react I don't know so actually this let me know what you all think we've done so far we've done to react projects would you really like another react project you like something else I'm gonna tell you let me tell you what's what's up so I talked to my boss this morning to try to figure out what the priorities are in terms of the projects that are that I know I'm gonna have to work on at some point you know in this this year that I thought that we would have a project it'd be a good candidate for react and maybe even redux but it turns out that that's not really a higher priority I thought it was a higher priority than it was so that can wait and might not even it might be more towards like the end of the year like December so for the immediate future so basically for this month for September the main website for Franciscan edu needs some work but it doesn't need it's not gonna be react not yet I'm eventually gonna redo that site completely and react but for right now I don't think I can dedicate the time to that although I'd love to redo it so for right now it's probably just gonna be me going through we currently exists and trying to make it better so cleaning up the UI trying to make it faster where I can mainly by you know getting rid of unused code and kind of eliminating a lot of the the image it's really image heavy right now and I think unnecessarily so trying to cut down on that just making things look a lot more clean I mean you all kind of probably know my style by now that I like things to be really clean minimal but here's the thing though that's going to be on project because it's already built using a content management system called Ektron which is dotnet framework based so I'm gonna be working in like C sharp like dotnet templates and stuff and I'm gonna be working with just straight like HTML CSS it's going to be really different than what I've done before so I'm actually I'm a little bit nervous I don't know if that how well that would go down but that's probably going to be first priority for the month of September if there's some if there's some other way that I could do a project and just spend like an hour a day on this project when I did the stream and then the rest of the day I can work on the main web site that might be possible as well but I'd like to know what you all think I mean if you'd like to switch it up and do something that's not react and instead do something that's like dotnet I mean that's that's fine with me I just want to make sure that if it's possible for me to do something that's more relevant to you all then I'd like to do it you know obviously it's not completely in my control because I got to work on whatever you know my boss tells me to work on but within that the freedom that I have on my projects I'd like to show you all what you want to see so anyway let me know about that my 5 minutes is up for this for this session I'm going to start another Pomodoro session right now and then I'll get through the rest of the live chat I realized I didn't get through that much of it so I'll just have to get through some more on the next time but anyway let me know think about it and let me know the only other project that I probably could work on is I have I have to work with Salesforce so there's like an application that we have for students who are interested in coming here they want to apply to go here that's all built through Salesforce and they have I think it's called like eight basically it's it's kind of like their templating system it was described to me is like some somewhat like JavaScript I'm not really sure that I don't really know if the person on the phone describing this was a developer or if they were sales so I don't really know how accurate this is but basically there was something that Salesforce uses that's they sold me if you know JavaScript you'll be able to do this so I don't know a lot about it but I know it's gonna be mostly CSS stuff occasionally maybe I'll go in and change some of the templates but to be honest with you right now I was checking out earlier today and I don't even know where to find the template so I'm gonna need to do some more research on that that's also going to be kind of a weird project where I'm going to be working kind of inside this other system to try to do it you know I won't be able to set it up exactly like I want to I'll just have to kind of work with what's there and change it so anyway so just let me know what you all think about those projects if you're interested in anything or you know any other ideas for now though I'm gonna go back and do some work I just not realized I had this still up on the screen I wonder if anybody just tuned in and like saw these really what what is going on with change of this project how I covered that up and it means you alright so let's do another Pomodoro session let's see what's next up on here so fix the checkbox all right let's fix this one I already showed you a little bit earlier what was wrong with it I can show you again in case you didn't see it before but check check this one out in that icon when we move over it overlaps all right that's that's no good it also overlaps at another point here so we need to fix that and I may have to just come up with some other way to position this other than what we're doing now and I'll show you what we're what we're doing with it okay so that checkbox now I've made its own component and I just call it an icon checkbox so if you are following along with what we're doing on github that's in the components folder you can look at ICON checkbox j/s and that's where we're at so right now I just have some inline Styles on that and or actually just position positioning this with absolute positioning so it shouldn't have been that much a surprise to me whatever the positioning was messed up usually when you try to use absolute positioning like that and you want your site to be responsive it doesn't work quite like you wanted to unless you're positioning something like in the in the corners usually the corners worked fine but things in the middle of the page don't work out at least that's been my experience so I'm thinking there's we could either do two things I could try to work with the existing breakpoints and change these values based on that I'm not really excited about doing that that just seems like it doesn't seem to me like the best solution the other solution would be to not use absolute positioning try to use try to do it some other way so that it wouldn't matter at all what the screen size is it's always gonna be at the end of that line so let's um let's see what we can do let's mess around with it here in dev tools a bit and I mean maybe we'll have to change the markup it will change how I was working in the in HTML somebody's just zoom in a bit so we can see and I can move this off to the side here let's make it there we go so there's the overlap so I mean obviously we could like I said we could just shift it around but here's here's what I don't think that'll work it's not a good solution also because I want to keep this component reusable right so there could be it could just say photography in that case the way we're positioning and now it might not be a bad thing we'll just shift the positioner on but also it could be really long so I guess what we want then is we wanted always to appear at the end and I suppose even wrap this wrap around it does yeah so even if this wrapped around I guess we would still wanted to appear at the end it won't look great but better that's better than overlapping the only other way that I can think of changing it that I know for sure would work all the time I guess would be to move the icon to the beginning but I don't really think that would look I don't think that would look right I guess we could try it but let's see if we can do it a different way and then as as a last resort we could probably just move this up here and then we'll know that it'll always work because it'll be right at the beginning excuse me sad too heady on okay all right so let's see I think our problem yeah let's go back to here and let me show you so the problem before that we were having was that I was trying to put this checkbox or this icon inside the the label right so I was trying to pass that in as a prop so basically the the text with an SVG in line I was going to pass it all in and I think we're having trouble with that and then I think it was I think of the Sebastian submitted a pull request where he came up with doing it away similar to this and then I changed it a bit turned it into its own component and then switched to this style of positioning so I kind of figured I mean ideally I would be able to pass it all in here I but I guess I have to be honest with you I can't even remember I'd have to go back and watch the video you did this I can't remember if it just totally failed and it wouldn't work at all or for it just wasn't working exactly how we wanted it to see but in any case that's why we we have these separated out so then you see when it comes out you know here there's this whole container div you know with all this stuff in here and then next to that we have this other div that has our image display table that's interesting let's mess around here's what I'm thinking right now what if we could take these two container divs and have them display sidebyside alright let's just I'm just gonna mess around a little bit here just with some of these properties and see what we get I need to reset some of this position of my getting with this to be actually let's get rid of a lot of this stuff when it comes to this kind of thing that's just okay I don't mind that now we may still have the same problem we get that's it okay I guess not this might just might not be a bad way to fix it if I can get them both on the same line okay all right I think I'm gonna check I have an idea but I'm gonna check the live chat first see if you all have a better idea oh okay just saw one there we go thank you who's that Carlos Carlos thank you so much that's exactly what the problem was all right for a second there I thought I forgot how CSS works I had with a hundred percent that's why all this stuff I was going with position and floats we're not working awesome okay so let's try this out we're just gonna move it back and forth of bed okay not mmm not terrible let's get rid of this float all right that's better yeah I kind of like that better we just did oh yes I like that better okay this is what I'd so here's a tip you probably already know this but if you want to make your screen even smaller than it already is just make your console dock or your dev tools docked and then you can shrink it down really small like smaller than normal I wanted to do this just to see obviously not no one's ever gonna be looking at it like that but I just wanted to see what would happen if we if this went on to another line mmhmm okay not bad let's just give this a lot more text and see what happens there we go oops yeah okay it looks like it it's not bad like this but once we get down smaller then it's not great I guess I'm okay with it for now since we I think this is the longest one that we have yeah I'm okay with it it's not perfect but for our use case right now it definitely works if we end up getting longer ones that need that need this then then I can worry about that at that point okay let's see anyway Hamza says you won't be going smaller than 320 pixels with ya for sure the only reason I wanted to go smaller was I just wanted to see like let's say we had something that was really long I just want to try to simulate what would happen and then after I thought well why don't I just put the text in there so that's why I was this was a better way to do it just adding more text originally I just didn't think about that but you're right yeah nothing's no screen that I know of is smaller than 320 pixels and with all right so let's just do this in our code so you end up having this div well and my mind block should work yeah okay I'm gonna have to get to that div with with this CSS there's no I don't think there's any way just rush I wonder which style I'm passing down let's check out our service request let's find our checkboxes style star checkbox it's trying to track down where our styles are here we go okay so we do have checkboxes here let's see what that margin bottoms being applied here great okay so whatever we put there with our margin bottom should work should be fine we don't want we don't want with 100% let's go with with Auto ok Auto words so the width auto floatleft and I guess we'll do this I can't remember with the default display was an English blog so we'll do displayinlineblock with Auto floatleft alright forget that one down and now this next one whoa okay that was definitely not the right thing to do what did I do all right let's see is it the float I was further with maybe that's odd I don't think I change anything else let's see all right let's let's get rid of these for now let's see what we had okay so if it was display table before mmhmm all right and they like to think about something different all right I was checking the live chat to see if I missed anything okay all right let's see what it yeah let me see that this week this okay maybe if I move this styles into I could maybe try to move this into our icon check box component and then depending on whether or not there's an icon I can have different styles that works yeah I guess first I did I just need to test see if I could do this twice on two different checkboxes I'm guessing that it wouldn't work it like let's say I did it on two different checkboxes right next to each other and have the same weird stuff happening so I guess it wouldn't matter either way let's see if I can I've never seen this max content min content before I want to try to keep this display table now and then set the width Auto and see what happens maybe I'll have a different result than I did before what was that I'm just gonna not set the display now that that was the width thing ice I guess is what the problem is we got to give it some sort of with I guess alright let's let's do let's give it a hundred percent with but minus the width of the icon so let's see how how big our icon is so icon yeah so like 24 pixels it's just the Sade let's give it 25 so let's let's give our with 100% 25 pixels see what that does okay better now now we can do this why is it going all the way up there okay okay thank you know live jet okay flexstretch is with my default a place automatically without any descending with all right eyes huh good some said said what's this sorcery in the in the hole I've said yeah it's yes okay so John Hanson is saying we can use flex display flex and then justify content space between alright let's try that out because I I'm thinking like I ain't hurtin Lee did something right me I don't know why this is now appearing way up at the top I'm trying to do it over here because I floated everything left interesting there we go and see all right let me try out this I want to show off this flex thing that John's talking about but basically we I thought this might end up being tricky because I remember when I messed with it last time it was it was a little bit tricky which is why I end up going with what I did alright so John's saying dude display flex and then justified content space between so flex so are we putting it on here then let's try it up oops whoa okay all right let me see whoa all right I lost track of time a bit let's let's stop here so I can get to some questions and then I have to get to my appointment and let me let me check let me scroll up now but to get to the last place where I left off in the live chat so sorry we're not gonna be able to finish this right now I feel like we're really close it's just a matter of figuring out what the best way is that that is going to work for the screen sizes I think we have maybe at least two possible solutions that that I can think of right now that will work I'll just have to finish those up tomorrow I need to check I need to check on traffic though to make sure I can get to my appointment on time because they're doing construction on the highway on the way there so alright it's telling me okay it'sit's it looks like traffic's not bad right now so I should be able to answer some questions and still be alright to get there let's see it's trying to find where I left off okay I think I found it yeah it's the last thing we were talking about was what the next project would be okay so I'm ash asked about a quick briefing on what I'm building so ash not sure if you're still watching but I guess I can quick click update for Astra for anyone else that's watching and wasn't sure what we're building this is just a react react site that allows users to submit requests and upload files and then those get sent to a project management system through their API and the files get uploaded to our server which we're running a droplet on digitalocean with node and nginx is a reverse proxy and users can also just get some other resources and some basic information download some images so it's not really that involved probably the the most complicated thing we're doing here is handling file uploads and form data okay so at some point nova glow had said but aren't you only doing clientside editing the moment you refresh the pager where it goes away yes that's true and it looks like no glow got some answers as well but I'll explain this just in case anyone else is having that that can't see the live chat I was thinking the same thing when you edit things in dev tools yes they're not by default they're not permanent you can set it up so that your project files actually can be edited through dev tools it's really cool I just never took the time to set that up but for now it's just a really fast way to see what's going on make some changes and I don't like to do a lot I don't like to do more than I can remember because then you're right if you refresh the page then you lose it all so I like to do a little bit see if it works and then transfer it over to my files and then kind of go back and forth like that I just uhhuh um so just says what I see your face yes if you can see my face it's kind of odd if I keep doing it like this I might I might switch and get a different camera I'm just using the builtin camera on an iMac and the angle is weird like I just feel like it keeps getting a shot of my forehead all the time and you can't really see my facial expressions so I think it would be better if the camera angle were a little bit lower so I don't know maybe I'll keep a lookout for any webcams that are on sale rude rude rang Shu says can anyone recommend me one of among the following so amber Jas Orillia Jas and polymer Jas I'm sorry I don't have experience with those I mean I I know what they are I've read about them but I don't have handson experience I don't really feel qualified to make a recommendation so hopefully there are some other people in the live chat that can can recommend something to you oh cool Blake said said hey I like the face preview awesome cool maybe oh uh maybe I'll keep it as long as I was afraid it would block too much of the code but it didn't seem to be a problem so as long as it's not a problem I'm fine with with leaving it there okay see Daryl asks react native versus PhoneGap and got a suggestion to use react native from word rang shoo yeah I um I also recommend react native all right I got to answer the door so I'll be right back okay yeah I recommend react native as low I phone gaps been around for a while and I don't have personal experience with react native yet I will soon but from what I've from what I've read about it if I had to say I'd say good with react native but like I said I don't have handson experience with it okay so it'sit's Brean so earlier I'd asked for clarification on how to pronounce a name so it's is it is it Bria no Driscoll is that it let me know if that's I'm pretty sure that's what that's what is supposed to be okay I was I was talking about editors earlier and Nova blow says Emacs is better than them Patrick says Emacs evil mode is better than Emacs I don't know what that is oh and brains of M user as well cool çf coder says what responds to the framework are you using doesn't appear to be bootstrap it's material UI but Bharat says so is there any project on Salesforce you'll be working on yeah actually I do have something that I need to I'm gonna work on in Salesforce so maybe I'll be doing that on the the livestream I'm not sure yet we'll see I don't know we'll see how it goes I still haven't decided what project I'd like to try to stick with the project I mean I could bounce back and forth and do like two different projects at once but I don't want it to be confusing I mean I could I could put them a different playlist name them you know different things but I'm undecided yet as to exactly what the next project will be okay all right I'm kind of going through a lot and just looking for any questions especially from new people because I'm gonna have to leave here in just a minute okay all right so I'm gonna end with this John Hanson said I could put a green screen behind me so that my background would be transparent you just see me act that would be really cool I but I don't know about having a green screen in my office yet we have a video studio that's it's actually right on the other side of the wall from my office and there's a huge green screen that they use in there but they're always filming something in there so I don't think they'd let me do my streams in there I don't know I'll see maybe they have some leftover green green stuff that I can hang that would be fun all right well I got a oh actually here's one more question Hamza said have you watched noob cat on Twitch I haven't watched her live yet I didn't I didn't get a chance we I talked to her on Twitter before which was really cool she she had written an article about livestreaming and I let her know how helpful that was for me and it was really who she was really encouraging for my stream and said said nice things about it so I really want to be able to watch her live at some point I'm just the time for me just doesn't work out but anyway I think from a little bit that I've seen in the stream it's awesome so alright so I gotta take off I got a good two to an appointment now and thanks for watching I really kind of hoped we'd get more done I really I actually really wanted to like combine the sass files and organize them a bit but it just didn't didn't work out today so I'll be back tomorrow assuming my wife doesn't get any worse and then I might have to take a day off and take care of the kids but otherwise I should be back tomorrow and thank you so much for watching in for all your help I really appreciate it and have a great day
