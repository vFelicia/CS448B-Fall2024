With timestamps:

00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with jesse i'm jesse and i'm really glad
00:10 - to be back i missed you all uh i was in
00:13 - new york city for free code camp top
00:16 - contributor party and then before that i
00:19 - was in salt lake city
00:21 - for react rally so if anybody has any
00:24 - questions about how all that went let me
00:26 - know i can answer that when we do
00:28 - question answer sessions and then at the
00:30 - end of the stream
00:31 - um i am still a little bit exhausted
00:34 - from it all because it was really
00:36 - awesome but i had very little sleep
00:38 - uh from basically like wednesday until
00:42 - yesterday that's a small amount of sleep
00:45 - but i did so much awesome stuff
00:47 - uh
00:48 - and
00:50 - so i'm kind of excited for what we're
00:52 - working on today uh it's it's pretty
00:54 - cool
00:55 - um we're gonna continue on with what
00:57 - we're doing in the last stream so in
00:58 - case you didn't see the last stream i'll
01:00 - give you a quick recap
01:02 - and also uh if if you're totally new and
01:04 - you haven't seen any of my streams let
01:05 - me take a minute just to explain what we
01:07 - do here
01:08 - so
01:09 - i am a
01:12 - full-time front-end developer employed
01:14 - by a small university
01:16 - and
01:17 - this i live stream my daily work so
01:20 - these projects are projects that i'm
01:22 - actually working on the project we're
01:24 - currently working on is the new main
01:25 - website for the university so it will be
01:28 - franciscan.edu when it launches
01:32 - these are not exactly tutorials although
01:35 - i hope that you all learned something
01:37 - from them i certainly learn a lot from
01:39 - you when i do them
01:40 - and so as you watch it really the value
01:43 - in this is just seeing
01:45 - what what it's like for me as a
01:46 - front-end developer
01:48 - and seeing how many mistakes that i
01:50 - actually make every day and i still
01:52 - manage to keep my job and how i work
01:55 - through those mistakes and and how i
01:57 - make decisions for projects so i do my
02:00 - best to explain things as i go along and
02:01 - feel free to ask you know any questions
02:04 - i don't think i've ever had anybody ask
02:05 - anything that i didn't want to answer so
02:10 - feel free to ask questions
02:12 - pretty much nothing offends me
02:15 - um
02:17 - i think that's it oh
02:19 - so i do pomodoro sessions for the stream
02:21 - so we'll do 25 minutes of coding and i
02:24 - won't really answer questions during
02:25 - that time and then i'll take five
02:26 - minutes to answer questions we'll do
02:28 - another 25 minutes uh session of coding
02:31 - and then at the end of the stream i'll
02:33 - take all the remaining time to answer
02:35 - any questions that you all have so if
02:37 - you ask a question it seems like i'm
02:39 - kind of ignoring you don't worry i'm
02:41 - only ignoring you for a little bit i'll
02:43 - get to you at some point
02:46 - uh okay so here's what we're working on
02:49 - today so we have a react project
02:53 - okay so a website progressive web app
02:57 - that's running react
02:59 - which is a javascript library
03:02 - and
03:03 - we need to create a contact form
03:07 - that when a user fills it out they put
03:09 - in their first name last name email and
03:11 - then whether they want to be uh
03:13 - undergrad graduate or online student at
03:15 - this university
03:17 - we need that data
03:19 - to be sent to salesforce
03:21 - and automatically create a new record
03:24 - for that student
03:26 - uh in our our sales force
03:28 - uh database or you know however you want
03:30 - to call it
03:32 - so last
03:34 - week our last stream we successfully
03:38 - created records
03:40 - okay but we we didn't make the form yet
03:42 - we just kind of did it all and
03:43 - hard-coded it in the back end with in
03:46 - our
03:47 - with node.js in our server.js file
03:50 - okay so
03:52 - today what we're going to do is we're
03:55 - number one we're actually going to
03:56 - create the correct records because if
03:58 - you remember we did get to send data
04:00 - over but it it went to the wrong place
04:02 - so we're going to try to go to the right
04:04 - place this time
04:05 - and we're going to try to
04:08 - actually create the form
04:11 - so that we can fill out the form
04:13 - on the site
04:14 - hit submit and hopefully have it have
04:17 - everything work
04:19 - okay so that's the plan for today we'll
04:21 - see how much of it we can get done
04:24 - and
04:25 - i'm going to go through real quick and
04:26 - just say hi and see if there's any
04:28 - questions i should answer right away
04:29 - before we get started
04:32 - and
04:35 - okay
04:37 - so hey everybody i see some some new
04:40 - people some old people i'm just going to
04:42 - say hi all at once because there's a lot
04:43 - of people saying hi
04:45 - um
04:48 - oh cool uh sore app says they use
04:50 - salesforce a lot to automate stuff
04:51 - awesome so
04:52 - uh maybe you can you can help me out as
04:54 - we're going through this
04:56 - uh what's up
05:00 - um all in all ask what type of job i'm
05:02 - doing i think i kind of explained that
05:04 - let me know if i didn't if you have
05:05 - anything more specific that you'd like
05:07 - to ask
05:09 - um
05:10 - let's see steven asked why i didn't get
05:11 - interviewed at the meet and greet for
05:12 - free code camp we just ran out of time
05:15 - that was all and i kind of wanted to
05:17 - hang back because i figured you all get
05:18 - to hear me talk all the time
05:20 - uh some of the other people
05:22 - you know are just kind of behind the
05:23 - scenes so i figured it'd be cool if they
05:24 - had a chance uh so i kind of waited and
05:27 - thought if we have time i'll get on
05:29 - there otherwise you know y'all can ask
05:31 - me whatever you want
05:33 - okay
05:34 - so let's get started
05:38 - i should show you my screen first that
05:40 - would help all right so here's what i've
05:42 - been working on
05:46 - and
05:47 - let's see all right so the latest thing
05:49 - that i've done that's different from the
05:51 - last time is i've um i've changed out a
05:55 - few things so number one i got these
05:57 - environment variables working so they
05:59 - weren't working the last time and
06:01 - there's a good reason why they weren't
06:02 - working because i didn't require this
06:04 - this dot end okay so i needed to to
06:08 - bring in that package
06:10 - first for this all to work so once i did
06:12 - that now it works so
06:14 - our file with the environment variables
06:15 - now works now what this does mean is if
06:17 - you're working on this project locally
06:20 - this will not work for you so once we
06:22 - get the form up and running if you try
06:24 - to actually submit the form it won't
06:25 - work because you won't have
06:28 - salesforce login info which there's not
06:30 - really anything i can do about that
06:32 - if you wanted to kind of use this on
06:33 - your own project you'll have to have
06:34 - your own salesforce account
06:36 - uh and and set that up
06:40 - and down here
06:42 - what i've done is i've put all this code
06:44 - that we use to send data
06:46 - inside this server.post and the
06:50 - the path now is inquiry hyphen submit
06:54 - so we're going to send from our front
06:56 - end we're going to send a post request
06:58 - to inquiry hyphen submit
07:02 - and then
07:04 - it's going to take that data that we
07:05 - send
07:07 - and it's going to use it here so for now
07:08 - i'm just hard coding because we're going
07:10 - to test it out with some hard-coded
07:12 - stuff just to make sure that it's
07:13 - creating a record in the right place
07:15 - with the right information
07:18 - and i didn't start my pomodoro timer let
07:21 - me start that
07:22 - and uh while we're here i just wanted to
07:25 - show off so a colleague of mine liz
07:28 - uh who's awesome and uh super smart
07:32 - showed me this website that she made
07:34 - when she was i don't know like 10 or 11
07:37 - so i just wanted to show it off i'm i'm
07:39 - kind of impressed this was from 2001
07:41 - like i don't even think i had a computer
07:43 - when i was 10 years old
07:45 - so i mean she was already making
07:46 - websites
07:48 - using html
07:50 - i like it so i thought i'd just show
07:52 - that show that off so shout out to liz
07:54 - thank you for sharing and thanks for
07:55 - giving me permission to show this on the
07:57 - stream so
07:59 - if any of you like are struggling with
08:00 - some design ideas you know feel free to
08:03 - use this as an example
08:07 - all right back to the code let me make
08:09 - this a bit bigger for you it's probably
08:11 - way too small
08:13 - i should probably start the server
08:16 - uh
08:17 - you're in dev i think it's dead
08:28 - all right that is probably big enough
08:31 - for now so
08:34 - i think before we were sending we're
08:37 - sending the the
08:39 - data
08:40 - as
08:42 - i don't know what it was it's something
08:43 - else i think the correct thing to send
08:45 - it as is contact
08:47 - so we're gonna hopefully that'll work
08:49 - and i have all the fields here except
08:51 - the last field which is going to be
08:57 - either graduate undergrad or online
09:01 - but i'm not sure what that field is
09:04 - exactly
09:06 - so i'm going to leave that blank for now
09:08 - because that's just going to take me
09:10 - like going through all the fields
09:11 - possible and trying to figure out which
09:13 - one matches up
09:14 - i'm not going to do that on the stream
09:15 - because that's super boring and we don't
09:17 - really need that to prove that this will
09:19 - work
09:20 - right so let me save this
09:26 - uh i was hoping we'd get some auto
09:27 - formatting on this but
09:29 - i guess not yet
09:31 - this is okay though
09:33 - why
09:34 - i really thought we would get
09:36 - a lot better auto formatting anyway
09:40 - i'm just going to change this to single
09:42 - quotes just to get rid of these squiggly
09:44 - lines
09:46 - because they always
09:48 - red squiggly lines always look so angry
09:50 - you know
09:51 - oh now we have some formatting okay cool
09:56 - so our our next step here
10:01 - i guess what we can do now is just
10:06 - like move this out of here and just call
10:09 - it like
10:11 - right away
10:12 - so let's do that
10:16 - so what we'll do is grab
10:18 - [Music]
10:21 - basically
10:29 - we'll grab all of this
10:34 - i'm just going to copy it
10:36 - and then paste it
10:38 - here
10:42 - will that work
10:44 - maybe
10:45 - actually let's let's take it out of
10:47 - there i'm gonna put it up here
10:50 - so this should just run right which is
10:53 - we're like automatically just calling
10:54 - all this so this should run as soon as
10:56 - the server restarts
10:58 - and then we can check well we'll see
11:01 - what comes up we should get an error
11:02 - message if it doesn't work so
11:05 - this will be our first check if it works
11:07 - then let's we'll move on and we'll
11:08 - actually create the form
11:10 - okay if not
11:12 - we'll switch it up try to make it work
11:15 - so let's save it
11:16 - this should auto restart
11:19 - all right cool we got some stuff in here
11:23 - invalid login
11:33 - all right then
11:37 - let me i have my end file open on my
11:40 - other screen
11:46 - all right so let me double check that i
11:48 - have the right stuff in there so
11:51 - unfortunately i'm not going to be able
11:52 - to show you this because then you'd have
11:53 - my password
11:54 - so
11:56 - it'll just take a second
12:09 - okay
12:10 - and
12:12 - so just put my password in
12:16 - and now i'm gonna get a security token
12:26 - so when you go to put in your your
12:28 - password here
12:30 - uh that it needs so like up here this is
12:33 - actually going to be if you're trying to
12:35 - do this on your own your salesforce
12:37 - password that you log in with
12:39 - and then
12:41 - you're gonna combine that with your
12:42 - security token
12:45 - and that will be
12:47 - what you use so
12:50 - let me um i'm just going to completely
12:53 - shut this server down for a second and
12:55 - then start it back up
12:58 - we're still getting it
13:01 - invalid username password security token
13:06 - huh
13:09 - all right
13:11 - that's a little bit weird because we
13:12 - this worked before
13:14 - um
13:18 - hmm
13:23 - the only other thing i could think of is
13:24 - uh resetting the security token also why
13:27 - i have this check out this swag i got it
13:30 - reactor alley so apple was there giving
13:32 - out free stuff and so i got a cool cup
13:36 - i have some iced coffee in there right
13:38 - now
13:39 - um
13:41 - all right let's do this so i i do have
13:43 - two different security tokens one of
13:45 - them i thought was invalid and i i
13:48 - thought i was using the right one let me
13:50 - try the other one
13:52 - if neither one of them works
13:54 - then
13:56 - i'll try to create a new security token
13:59 - and
14:03 - i know i have it
14:05 - up somewhere
14:09 - on my other screen sorry i have to do
14:10 - all this on my other screen there's
14:12 - really no no other way around this
14:26 - i think i deleted the email with my
14:28 - security tokens where's the
14:32 - trash
14:34 - there we go deleted items
14:38 - where are you
15:12 - that would have been what day thursday
15:16 - yeah i think we created that first token
15:18 - on thursday
15:20 - oh
15:21 - where is it
15:50 - all right i don't know what happened to
15:51 - it so i guess we're not going to try the
15:53 - old
15:55 - the old one
15:57 - do you know what i may have had it saved
15:59 - let me go back to that info see if i can
16:02 - just go back to the original
16:05 - see if it'll work
16:08 - all right i'm gonna save that now
16:10 - and
16:13 - see this will work
16:17 - hmm
16:22 - oh
16:23 - you know what
16:25 - i know why it's not working and this is
16:27 - silly so
16:29 - um
16:31 - in my m-file originally on the last time
16:34 - we streamed which you know what it
16:36 - wasn't thursday because i was at that
16:37 - conference it was
16:40 - probably monday
16:42 - wow it's been a while so last monday i
16:45 - just named them username and password
16:47 - but when i i redid some stuff in here
16:49 - and i changed the name to salesforce
16:50 - username and salesforce password uh
16:53 - because i thought you know maybe i'll
16:55 - have to put more stuff in this m file
16:57 - and
16:58 - i i want to make sure that it's clear
17:01 - that these are the salesforce username
17:02 - and password
17:05 - so
17:06 - [Music]
17:07 - i'm going to change the names here and
17:09 - then everything should work
17:19 - all right
17:20 - and
17:22 - i think i need to type in
17:25 - there we are
17:28 - cool a different error
17:30 - nice
17:40 - all right
17:41 - so here we are we we went in
17:44 - successfully and it looks like we have
17:48 - an invalid
17:50 - field all right i was i was a little bit
17:52 - worried about this
17:58 - there's no such column as first name
18:09 - okay
18:13 - all right let's scroll down here so
18:16 - um
18:18 - all right let me look
18:20 - in salesforce and i'll see if i can show
18:22 - you i'll um i'll pull this over and show
18:25 - you but if there's any student
18:26 - information i can't so
18:39 - actually
18:40 - yeah you know what i i think i may end
18:42 - up looking at student information so i'm
18:44 - not going to show that live
18:46 - uh i'll just like describe what what i'm
18:48 - doing here
18:51 - so
18:52 - my music stopped on spotify
18:55 - so let's
18:58 - go back
19:07 - okay
19:09 - um
19:31 - all right let's
19:33 - bump this down so
19:35 - good
19:36 - all right so let's try to
19:40 - just do this
19:41 - let's say
19:43 - name
19:49 - let's try to run it with this
19:58 - name invalid field
20:04 - why is it still
20:08 - it's still saying first name uh why
20:11 - i just changed that
20:14 - oops you know what i probably changed it
20:15 - in the wrong spot that's why
20:20 - and we uh we copied and pasted it up
20:22 - here so
20:25 - maybe that's why
20:27 - now
20:33 - no that was the right spot
20:38 - all right let's try it again
20:40 - oops
20:47 - oops
21:05 - let me totally shut the server down
21:13 - and start it up
21:37 - oh no
21:40 - i had this one run going too
21:42 - that's why i kept running everything
21:44 - twice
21:46 - let's get rid of that
21:52 - okay
22:14 - okay
22:35 - all right let me check
22:39 - to see if this even
22:41 - you know came in at all
23:05 - all right so i don't think
23:09 - anything was created
23:16 - let me check my time all right we still
23:18 - about nine more minutes until i'll go
23:20 - back and answer questions
23:25 - all right so let me look at this
23:27 - a bit more
23:46 - hmm
24:16 - hmm if i had name or was it capitalized
24:20 - i can't remember if it was originally
24:21 - capitalized or not so
24:23 - i'm going to try it out with
24:25 - being capitalized
24:27 - see if it does makes any difference at
24:29 - all
24:31 - and it doesn't look like it does
24:34 - please check the security settings of
24:36 - this field
24:41 - okay
24:43 - um
24:49 - i wonder if i can add
25:12 - i need to find in salesforce
25:14 - where the state is going
26:15 - all right we might just skip
26:20 - might just skip to the
26:22 - actually making the fields in react
26:26 - because at this point i mean we know
26:30 - we know we're connecting to salesforce
26:32 - the problem is just
26:35 - making sure that we're
26:37 - we have the right
26:39 - keys for our key value pairs uh for our
26:42 - data so
26:43 - that's that's just gonna have to be me
26:46 - going through salesforce and trying to
26:48 - figure out exactly what
26:50 - uh what these keys are
26:54 - because to be honest it's not exactly
26:56 - clear and i'm not the one that set it
26:58 - all up so maybe i just have to get a
27:00 - hold of somebody else
27:02 - uh so let's
27:03 - switch it up a bit
27:07 - and what we can do now is get rid of
27:12 - get rid of this so we don't have this
27:14 - run every time we uh
27:18 - we save something
27:20 - okay
27:23 - all right
27:24 - let's get rid of that
27:27 - and
27:31 - let's
27:32 - go to
27:35 - where's this going to be you know what
27:36 - let's make a totally new component for
27:38 - this because i think
27:40 - we'll have this on on multiple pages
27:47 - so let's go in here and check out our
27:50 - components
27:53 - so our components folder
27:55 - and
27:56 - we're gonna make a new file and we'll
27:58 - call this
28:00 - um
28:02 - inquiry.js
28:06 - because it's going to be the inquiry
28:07 - form
28:10 - and
28:12 - let's just pull in
28:16 - some code from another component
28:22 - maybe
28:25 - let's just pull in the code from this
28:27 - this hero
28:28 - component just something just give us a
28:31 - little boiler plate right
28:34 - and
28:35 - we'll take out
28:37 - we'll probably want grid we'll
28:38 - definitely want button
28:40 - uh styles
28:42 - probably don't need typography we'll
28:44 - leave it in for now though just in case
28:46 - uh
28:47 - all right cool so we can leave that
28:49 - alone
28:50 - we'll come back to these in a minute
28:52 - what i want to do really with this is
28:53 - move this down to the bottom
28:55 - so we've been doing that with all our
28:57 - components moving all our styles down to
28:59 - the bottom so as we as we edit things
29:02 - we're doing that
29:04 - a little bit easier when you first go
29:06 - into the component to figure out what's
29:07 - happening if you don't have to scroll
29:08 - down through all the styles first
29:11 - let's change our name so instead of this
29:13 - component being hero
29:16 - we're going to make it oops not going to
29:18 - be able to do that
29:21 - here we're going to make an inquiry
29:24 - so we have to change it here
29:27 - and then also
29:28 - down here
29:32 - inquiry
29:35 - okay
29:36 - um
29:38 - right now it's we're passing in a lot of
29:41 - props
29:43 - for now i don't anticipate this
29:44 - component having any props so let's get
29:47 - rid of all these props
29:53 - okay
29:54 - and
29:56 - we can get rid of a lot of this
30:00 - so all these options
30:06 - and
30:09 - okay
30:11 - and
30:12 - now within our return
30:16 - we can really get rid of
30:20 - pretty much most of it right almost all
30:23 - of this
30:23 - uh so
30:27 - yeah tell me we have our basic stuff
30:29 - here
30:31 - we're gonna leave
30:34 - let's leave these button styles just in
30:37 - case we um we want to reuse them
30:42 - i'm not going to need this parallax
30:55 - actually now that i think about it there
30:57 - is going to be we're probably going to
30:58 - have one prop
31:01 - but i'm not going to worry about it
31:02 - right now the prop is going to have to
31:04 - do with
31:05 - if we place the form
31:07 - on a section of the website that has a
31:09 - white background
31:11 - we're going to need the button to look
31:12 - different than if we place the form on a
31:14 - section of the website that has a dark
31:16 - background not only the button but
31:18 - all the the color for all the font and
31:20 - everything so
31:22 - those might be the only options we might
31:24 - basically have like a light and a dark
31:26 - theme for this form
31:30 - uh but for now let's just get it get it
31:32 - working
31:35 - so we're going to start out with a grid
31:38 - component and this is going to be
31:40 - container
31:44 - and
31:45 - inside of that
31:47 - we're going to have
31:49 - some more grid stuff so we're going to
31:51 - do a grid
31:54 - and
31:55 - we're going to give it
31:58 - oops that's my timer all right we'll
32:00 - stop here
32:02 - let me take a short break and go to
32:05 - the chat
32:09 - i'm going to scroll all the way up to
32:10 - the top of the chat and try to get
32:12 - through as much as i can
32:19 - steven says that dry erase board is
32:21 - nowhere near big enough just saying so i
32:23 - have a dry eraser behind me you can't
32:25 - see it in this view but yeah actually i
32:28 - haven't used that dry erase board for
32:31 - i
32:32 - prob at least a year
32:35 - so i don't really use it that much
32:39 - i used to like sketch things out on it
32:41 - but i
32:42 - right i just use paper now
32:54 - see uh all in all says all of your
32:57 - courses are really cool thanks for
32:59 - everything you did for free oh you're
33:01 - welcome you're welcome thanks for saying
33:03 - that i appreciate that
33:10 - let's see
33:11 - andre says hello from portugal hey how's
33:14 - it going thanks for joining us
33:17 - let's see
33:18 - um
33:19 - niranjan says hi how to be a front-end
33:22 - developer and what should i have to
33:24 - study
33:24 - um if you want to be a front-end
33:26 - developer i would start out with the
33:28 - free code camp lessons
33:30 - start with those and then kind of branch
33:31 - out from there and supplement with
33:33 - youtube videos and books
33:36 - as you go on
33:38 - but that'll give you like it'll ease you
33:40 - into things very nicely and it'll hit a
33:42 - bunch of topics that you will need to
33:43 - know
33:44 - uh and then figure out what you like and
33:46 - then you can specialize from there but
33:48 - that's that's my advice to get started
33:53 - uh ezekiel says how are you john hanson
33:57 - says uh hi how's the hand uh so my hand
34:01 - if you don't know i had surgery on my
34:03 - wrist a few weeks back
34:05 - and um
34:06 - it still hurts i think it's going to
34:08 - hurt for a couple more months before
34:10 - it's really better so
34:12 - um
34:14 - it's okay i made it through carrying
34:16 - bags and stuff through lots of different
34:18 - airports um and
34:21 - i could do it i mean it hurt but i could
34:23 - do it so in terms of like having the
34:25 - strength to actually do things it's it's
34:27 - there
34:28 - uh so i think i'm gonna try to start
34:30 - like working out a little bit and just
34:32 - see how much i could do uh probably this
34:35 - week so i started back on my my diet
34:37 - again this week
34:38 - and um i'm gonna i'm not gonna be so
34:40 - extreme like the last time i went on a
34:42 - diet i was really trying to lose weight
34:43 - and i dropped like i don't like 15
34:45 - pounds
34:46 - uh this time i'm i'm not really gonna
34:49 - try to lose weight very fast uh just
34:52 - kind of like kind of slow
34:54 - and maybe just worry
34:56 - just worried about like eating healthy
34:58 - building muscle and things like that but
35:00 - i'm gonna see how much i can do with
35:01 - this wrist for now
35:10 - uh vpool says what's this 93rd part of
35:12 - project 5 or just part 2 of the title
35:16 - okay so it's part two of us working on
35:18 - with the salesforce api but it is the
35:21 - 93rd installment of project five here so
35:26 - yeah we've been working on this for
35:27 - quite a while
35:33 - uh sanjay says hey it's been a while
35:35 - since i caught up with the stream uh
35:37 - what project are you working on
35:38 - currently
35:40 - uh this is the main website for
35:43 - franciscan university
35:46 - so it's a react project um it's using
35:49 - react node wordpress for content
35:50 - management
35:52 - next js so we got some server side
35:55 - rendering going on custom routing so
35:58 - that's that's what we're working on
36:01 - uh john hanson says high five for
36:03 - building a new component
36:05 - cool yeah i think
36:07 - um
36:08 - it's always cool to i think on the
36:10 - stream to build a new component um
36:13 - especially for those who are starting
36:15 - out and are new with react uh because
36:17 - like
36:19 - the more times you go through that
36:20 - process and see it just the more
36:21 - comfortable you'll be with with doing it
36:23 - and for me too like if i get like i
36:26 - haven't really done much coding for the
36:28 - last week
36:29 - so
36:30 - uh i don't want to get too rusty at kind
36:32 - of doing things although i rarely code a
36:35 - component from scratch i'm always
36:36 - copying and pasting things which which i
36:38 - think is a good way to do it it's
36:40 - efficient
36:46 - all right
36:47 - uh neeraj says how do you learn
36:49 - programming
36:50 - um
36:53 - well there's a lot of different ways to
36:54 - start out if you're interested in doing
36:55 - the kind of stuff that i'm doing here i
36:57 - would definitely start with the free
36:59 - code camp exercises so check out
37:00 - freecodecamp.org and go through that
37:03 - uh
37:04 - but there's so many different types of
37:05 - programming
37:07 - it kind of depends on what you want to
37:09 - do so if you let me know what you're
37:10 - really interested in maybe i give you
37:11 - something more specific uh you know
37:13 - somewhere to start out but
37:16 - all right cool so my timer is up
37:18 - and
37:19 - i'm gonna go back now and we're going to
37:21 - do one more pomodoro session working on
37:24 - this before
37:25 - i go back and answer some more questions
37:27 - and that'll probably be
37:28 - the only coding we do for for today
37:31 - it'll just be this next 25 minutes
37:33 - uh so let's go into this grid and now
37:35 - that i'm looking at this i think it's
37:36 - probably easier if i copy and paste some
37:38 - grid stuff from somewhere else so i
37:40 - don't have to try to remember or look up
37:43 - what to say
37:44 - uh extra small classes
37:47 - all right so you extra small
37:50 - i'm trying to find a grid that has
37:53 - everything
37:54 - that we need here um
37:58 - all right i guess i'll just copy this
37:59 - for now
38:00 - and i'll guess at the other one
38:03 - so what i mean in particular is this
38:05 - like for extra small screens we want
38:08 - this to be 12 and then i'm guessing
38:11 - small is the next one let's try
38:14 - uh six for small you'll see why i'm
38:17 - doing this in a second if you're not um
38:19 - sure what what we're doing this for
38:22 - um
38:24 - let's see
38:25 - and then within here
38:27 - this we're going to want to put some
38:28 - form elements so let's check out
38:32 - do i have
38:36 - i guess i don't have any uh any windows
38:38 - here so let me pull over
38:40 - actually i could use this
38:42 - let's pull this out
38:44 - and
38:45 - uh now that i have this dark theme on
38:47 - here i can't see where this
38:49 - corner is there we go
38:53 - all right let's go to material
38:59 - dot ui.com
39:00 - so we're using material ui
39:03 - for a lot of our
39:05 - design for this site it comes with a lot
39:08 - of pre-made components in the material
39:10 - design style
39:12 - and what we want to find now is our
39:14 - inputs
39:18 - so let's go
39:20 - this is going to show us the api but
39:21 - really what i want is a demo so we want
39:24 - the text field demo first let me make
39:26 - this bigger
39:27 - so you all can see
39:29 - and we can actually make this like
39:31 - really big we'll do full screen
39:34 - and this is what i want i want these
39:36 - components but i want to do the
39:37 - controlled version so i believe it's
39:40 - down here
39:43 - oh maybe they changed it
39:45 - um
39:50 - customized input
39:58 - all right well let's just start with
40:00 - something basic um so we'll just grab
40:05 - i need a placeholder
40:07 - probably not i don't really need a
40:09 - placeholder so we'll just grab a basic
40:13 - text field
40:16 - and we'll move it over oops
40:22 - move it over here and so we want to
40:24 - import this text field
40:27 - component
40:28 - and then we're going to bring in the
40:30 - text field
40:38 - here's what we need
40:44 - and i guess we could put this all within
40:46 - a form
40:53 - or not i don't really think it matters
40:54 - for the way we're doing this but
40:57 - let's check this out for now we'll just
40:58 - bring in a text field
41:02 - and
41:06 - nope
41:16 - okay
41:17 - so our text field here let's clean this
41:19 - up a bit
41:22 - we're going to say
41:24 - given an idea first name
41:31 - and a label of first name
41:35 - and
41:36 - [Music]
41:37 - we don't have classes for text field yet
41:39 - i guess we could import those we could
41:41 - copy and paste them over
41:43 - value is going to be this state
41:45 - first
41:47 - first name
41:49 - about we'll just do like this first name
41:53 - like that
41:55 - this one change this handle change
41:58 - first name
42:04 - okay
42:05 - so that
42:06 - looks good let's pull
42:08 - some of this stuff over so we definitely
42:10 - need the handle change
42:12 - and we need our state
42:17 - so let's pull this up
42:18 - [Music]
42:20 - and
42:22 - let's see currencies all right we'll get
42:24 - our styles too in just a second and
42:26 - we'll pull those in
42:34 - is that where i'm supposed to do this
42:36 - yeah
42:38 - um we don't need
42:40 - so we have to change these up a bit so
42:42 - we're going to have first
42:45 - first name and then we're gonna end up
42:47 - having
42:48 - last name
42:51 - oops
42:54 - last name and then this will be email
42:58 - and this will be
43:00 - um
43:02 - student type i'm not sure what to call
43:04 - that yet but eventually we will have
43:06 - that
43:08 - and for now
43:10 - these are all just going to be blank
43:15 - and actually did we have an example with
43:17 - control component is that what i just
43:19 - saw
43:20 - uh let's also
43:23 - grab that text field
43:26 - here
43:27 - and pop that down here
43:32 - okay
43:33 - this set state great all right so that
43:36 - should work
43:37 - we don't have classes stewie uh we need
43:40 - to uh set our prob
43:44 - there we go
43:46 - please ask questions if i'm going too
43:48 - fast or skipping through this way too
43:50 - fast but
43:54 - for this
43:59 - this is just going to allow us to
44:01 - instead of having to type this props all
44:03 - the time
44:04 - now we can just type classes it just
44:06 - saves a little bit of space and then if
44:08 - we add any other props which we probably
44:10 - will we can just add them in here and
44:12 - then we can just use them straight away
44:14 - like that so
44:16 - um i believe this is called object
44:19 - destructuring and i think it's an es6
44:21 - thing
44:25 - all right i'm going to take a breath for
44:27 - a second because i just went a little
44:28 - bit you know fast so i'm going to take a
44:30 - breath and explain a little bit about
44:32 - what's going on here
44:33 - so
44:34 - we have our text field
44:36 - the value of our text field
44:38 - is going to be determined by
44:41 - the value of first name in state
44:45 - but what will happen is when we type in
44:47 - this field
44:49 - on change so every time we type
44:50 - something in here
44:52 - it's going to call this function called
44:53 - handle change and it's going to
44:57 - pass in first name
44:59 - and what this will do is say okay
45:02 - we'll take the name right of
45:05 - whatever input that is because we're
45:06 - going to have more than one and we're
45:08 - going to set state
45:10 - to whatever that value is now so
45:12 - whatever is typed into that input is now
45:15 - going to become the state here in this
45:17 - case our first name state
45:19 - so anytime state changes in react it
45:22 - causes a re-render of the component so
45:25 - it's going to re-render and when this
45:26 - component goes to re-render it's going
45:28 - to say okay what's our value and it's
45:30 - going to look back in state
45:32 - and now
45:33 - our updated value and state is going to
45:36 - be
45:37 - the value for this so
45:39 - that's the way the flow goes when you
45:40 - use a component it's called a a
45:42 - controlled input right
45:46 - uh controlled component right so that
45:48 - the value is actually controlled by the
45:51 - states
45:53 - so a little bit different
45:55 - uh than if you're just
45:57 - have
45:58 - i mean even if you were to control
46:00 - things through javascript maybe if
46:02 - you're using jquery the value would be
46:05 - read and change directly but in this
46:08 - case it's it's
46:09 - state that really gets changed
46:12 - and then everything flows from there so
46:14 - we don't change the value directly we
46:16 - change state state causes state change
46:19 - causes re-render and then value comes
46:22 - from state
46:24 - hopefully that makes a little bit of
46:25 - sense
46:28 - um
46:31 - once you use it a few times if if you're
46:33 - not if you don't already understand
46:34 - what's happening if you use it a few
46:36 - times you'll you'll understand it it
46:38 - makes a lot more sense
46:41 - okay
46:42 - so now that we have that one in here
46:47 - let's copy and paste
46:52 - and we're going to use
46:56 - three of these inputs
47:01 - and we'll just switch up the names here
47:04 - uh so this is this one will be easy
47:06 - we'll just switch it to last name
47:20 - oops
47:29 - last name
47:31 - and then this one will be
47:33 - email
47:56 - okay
47:57 - so let's save that and see what it looks
47:59 - like
48:01 - um so i am i'm running this right
48:04 - yeah
48:08 - so let's go to
48:09 - localhost
48:13 - logo is 3000
48:15 - and oops we actually need to use this
48:17 - component so
48:19 - let's add this component right onto our
48:22 - home page
48:25 - and
48:28 - see what it looks like so
48:31 - i don't think i have a home page up here
48:33 - let's go to our index
48:37 - and on our index first we'll import this
48:39 - so let's just grab this for now
48:43 - copy and paste it and then change this
48:45 - to
48:47 - inquiry
48:53 - inquiry and then now down here
48:56 - we'll just pick a section
49:01 - let's see what this looks like see we
49:02 - should put it
49:12 - um
49:17 - i guess we could just throw it
49:20 - right below one of these top sections
49:23 - degrees
49:26 - yeah this is going to have its own grid
49:28 - so let's put it inside
49:37 - yeah let's just add it as another text
49:38 - section there's another section here and
49:40 - it's going to be inquiry
49:44 - and we have no props to pass in right
49:46 - now
49:47 - so let's see what happens
49:51 - cool
49:52 - and here it is
49:54 - pretty terrible right now
49:57 - but at least we we have our inputs let's
49:59 - type and we could see hey it's working
50:02 - things things go in there
50:04 - if we really wanted to we could look in
50:06 - devtools and see that the state is
50:08 - actually changing but i'm just going to
50:09 - trust that the state works right now
50:12 - since otherwise we may not
50:14 - even really see anything
50:16 - so
50:18 - great so we have our fields
50:20 - the style of this is awful right now
50:23 - right but we're not worried about the
50:24 - style we want it to work first
50:28 - so
50:30 - let's add
50:32 - our last section in which is going to be
50:34 - a drop down
50:38 - so first we can just make now let's
50:41 - first let's go to material ui
50:43 - uh the documentation again
50:46 - and let's find
50:52 - let's
50:52 - see there's got to be one for drop down
50:58 - or select
51:00 - so that this menu
51:05 - selects there we go
51:07 - so you want to
51:08 - put in one of these selects it's just
51:10 - going to look like this
51:12 - so
51:13 - we're going to do kind of the same thing
51:14 - again
51:16 - i'm going to grab some of these
51:18 - so we'll import
51:24 - this select
51:26 - and
51:28 - select empty
51:32 - i don't know if we'll need that or not
51:39 - yeah and this handle changes actually
51:41 - it's made a little bit different so
51:43 - we'll probably have to
51:46 - change up the way we're doing things
51:53 - hmm
51:56 - i think i might like this way better
51:58 - we'll see if we switch it to that way
52:00 - because then it's one less thing we have
52:02 - to pass in here
52:03 - so
52:04 - let's see
52:06 - we have our
52:12 - actually let's let's get this this whole
52:14 - thing here
52:19 - and we'll probably have to pull over
52:21 - form control as well
52:23 - but
52:24 - we're going to go with another grid
52:30 - there we go and
52:35 - we're going to
52:36 - do the same thing here that we did with
52:38 - the other ones
52:39 - all right these are just the columns so
52:40 - on an extra small screen this will take
52:42 - up 12 out of 12 columns on a small
52:45 - screen and up it will take up only 6 out
52:47 - of 12 columns so it'll be 50 width
52:50 - and then over here 100 width
52:53 - uh we also need to import form control
52:56 - import label and menu item
52:59 - let's go up here
53:03 - and
53:04 - i'll just grab these
53:16 - i don't need the helper text
53:21 - okay
53:23 - we'll just verify that that's actually
53:25 - showing up
53:27 - yep it shows up and
53:29 - see we can
53:31 - check here
53:33 - now
53:38 - we can change things up a bit so
53:44 - our
53:45 - name
53:46 - is going to be
53:48 - we call this student type
53:54 - we'll give it an id of student type
54:00 - and our values
54:04 - um so this will say
54:07 - under
54:09 - undergraduate
54:12 - graduate
54:15 - and online
54:20 - and then we'll replace these
54:30 - undergraduate
54:37 - graduates and online
54:44 - okay
54:47 - all right now you remember i said
54:49 - we're gonna have to
54:51 - change something so currently
54:54 - our
54:55 - handle change is expecting us to pass in
54:58 - the name
55:00 - but
55:03 - what we could do
55:08 - labels first name
55:13 - so here for input pros we are giving it
55:16 - a name of student type
55:27 - all right let's let's just do it then
55:29 - like like this
55:31 - i kind of wanted to switch it up
55:34 - so that the text inputs use the same
55:37 - thing as this one but for now i think
55:38 - this will be the fastest way to get it
55:40 - working
55:43 - student type
55:44 - okay
55:46 - and let's save that
55:50 - oops keep going the wrong way
55:52 - oops i forgot to change age so
55:57 - instead of
55:58 - age let's go with
56:00 - um
56:08 - student type
56:09 - and we need to change it here
56:16 - student type and one more time
56:23 - student type
56:27 - okay
56:29 - whoa
56:30 - and
56:32 - this is way too small
56:39 - let's pull over i guess some of the
56:45 - styles for this
56:58 - i mean maybe the form control will pull
57:00 - over
57:07 - let's see what that does for us
57:09 - there we are
57:10 - okay
57:12 - so now we have this
57:15 - so this is all that we need in terms of
57:17 - inputs for our form we will need a
57:19 - submit button
57:26 - okay
57:27 - and
57:29 - let me check my time oh about five
57:32 - minutes okay
57:33 - uh let's
57:39 - let me grab
57:41 - some code from a previous project
57:44 - to speed things up so
57:46 - in the um
57:49 - the resource center project that we did
57:52 - that was a react project we we have a
57:54 - form on there it's a much more
57:55 - complicated form but we can use
58:01 - the same thing
58:07 - so we had a handle form data
58:12 - so let's put this in here and it's going
58:14 - to be crazy at first
58:16 - right but
58:18 - here's we're going to do handle form
58:20 - data
58:21 - we're going to create a new
58:24 - why is form data is not defined
58:27 - anyway
58:34 - we'll see how much of this we can get
58:35 - working before
58:37 - the timer's up
58:38 - probably not going to get it completely
58:40 - working
58:41 - uh but
58:42 - you know at least we have something on
58:43 - the page now for key values
58:53 - hmm
58:55 - all right see how i had we had the state
58:58 - structured here
59:00 - okay
59:01 - i see so we actually had the
59:04 - form
59:12 - we don't need any of this file stuff
59:14 - right because we're not uploading files
59:17 - okay this will be cool actually to have
59:19 - a a loading
59:21 - thing come up so we'll leave that in
59:23 - even though we don't have this in the
59:25 - page yet
59:28 - we're also going to leave this this
59:30 - fetch in there
59:38 - and our upload url
59:41 - will be
59:42 - for now
59:47 - what did we set it in our server what
59:49 - was this
59:53 - inquiry submit
59:55 - so upload url will be
60:04 - and resubmit
60:06 - okay and we're going to send a post
60:09 - request
60:11 - and then the data we're going to send is
60:13 - just going to be data right so this
60:16 - const this new form data
60:21 - okay and then
60:22 - we're going to do some stuff depending
60:24 - on the response that we get we're going
60:25 - to do some different things
60:28 - open success true cool
60:31 - uh we're gonna have to add in some of
60:33 - this dialogue stuff which i'll probably
60:34 - just copy and paste from
60:37 - so if if you want to check out the full
60:38 - code of what we were doing it's the
60:40 - service request.js
60:42 - is the file name and that's in the
60:45 - resource center project
60:47 - under the views
60:49 - folder
60:50 - so it's service request.js
60:52 - i'll just copy and paste the link in
60:54 - case anybody wants like the big picture
60:56 - of of how it all fits together
61:00 - okay
61:06 - all right cool
61:07 - so the mainly the part
61:09 - the only part in here that i'm really
61:10 - worried about right now that will
61:12 - actually do anything or work at this
61:14 - point is this here
61:16 - right this is going to what's going to
61:18 - send the data to our back end
61:22 - um now this particular way of doing
61:25 - things with the form data it's it's
61:27 - gonna work no matter what we add with a
61:30 - form this small we could probably just
61:32 - hard code like here's what i want to
61:34 - send in there and just form that object
61:36 - ourselves
61:37 - but we'll since this is already in there
61:39 - and it it should work we'll leave it in
61:41 - there
61:43 - what we will need to do though is adjust
61:46 - the way the state is structured here so
61:48 - instead of just state like right off the
61:50 - bat we'll have to say form
61:53 - and then
61:54 - within form
61:56 - then have all these
62:00 - right so
62:02 - it's going to mess up
62:04 - our controlled components for a little
62:06 - bit
62:08 - we'd have to
62:09 - set it and make sure that
62:12 - uh we have
62:15 - uh we're getting the state from the
62:18 - right place
62:23 - see
62:27 - hear the wind pushing
62:32 - yeah this is a lot more complicated if
62:35 - you check out that link you can see that
62:36 - that's a much more complicated form so
62:39 - definitely more than we need for this
62:40 - one
62:42 - and my timer is up so i'm just going to
62:44 - save this for now
62:46 - even though the changes i just made are
62:48 - gonna
62:49 - it doesn't look like it's broken but in
62:51 - reality it it's breaking some stuff
62:53 - behind the scenes
62:54 - uh now
62:56 - i'm gonna go
62:58 - to the chat
63:00 - and i'm going to answer whatever
63:02 - questions remain in the live chat and
63:03 - then we'll finish things up
63:19 - um niraj says how can you help me in
63:21 - programming uh well if you watch this
63:24 - stream i'm sure hopefully you'll pick up
63:26 - something helpful
63:29 - there are a lot of tutorial videos
63:31 - though on this youtube channel
63:33 - that may be more helpful to you if
63:36 - you're just starting out so check those
63:37 - out for sure
63:42 - um
63:42 - jam punks is built from windows now i'm
63:45 - i'm actually developing on a mac right
63:48 - now
63:49 - uh
63:50 - oh oolu
63:54 - i'm really sorry if i mispronounce your
63:55 - name
63:56 - uh let me know how i should pronounce
63:57 - that i'll do my best next time uh but
64:00 - anyway that says what so what exactly
64:02 - you're trying to develop uh in this
64:04 - particular stream i'm trying to create a
64:07 - form that sends data uh to our nodejs
64:11 - backend and then from there it sends the
64:14 - data into salesforce
64:17 - overall for the entire project we're
64:19 - creating a
64:21 - a website for university with react
64:25 - node
64:27 - graphql wordpress for content management
64:31 - so that's that's the overall project
64:34 - victor says you are awesome jesse
64:36 - thank you i appreciate that
64:40 - uh jay charles is here charles says
64:42 - hello how's it going charles
64:45 - let's see
64:48 - david says coding live is the best
64:50 - exercise
64:51 - awesome cool i'm glad you glad you like
64:53 - it
64:55 - it's definitely uh i hope it's useful
64:57 - for you all it's it's so helpful for me
64:59 - i learned so much from you all
65:01 - and just having to explain what i'm
65:03 - doing also makes me really think about
65:05 - like why am i doing it like this
65:08 - and it kind of keeps me like really
65:10 - honest and stops me from stagnating you
65:12 - know like if if there's a better way to
65:14 - do something in a newer way like i'm
65:16 - gonna try to use it
65:17 - uh just to save myself the embarrassment
65:20 - of being caught you know live in front
65:22 - of all of you using uh you know outdated
65:24 - stuff
65:28 - okay
65:35 - um
65:37 - programmer says remove the forum it
65:39 - gives you an error
65:40 - the colon i think
65:46 - programmer i'm i'm not sure
65:55 - i'm not sure exactly what you were
65:56 - referring to then is this when
66:00 - this was here
66:05 - i i assume you're talking about form
66:08 - like f-o-r-m so i know yeah this will
66:11 - cause trouble for now i'll need to
66:12 - adjust some things to get this to work
66:15 - or i can go back and and not do it this
66:18 - way
66:18 - i'll see i'm not sure what i want to do
66:25 - david sands is you are the best
66:26 - programmer here
66:28 - i i kind of doubt i appreciate you
66:30 - saying that but i i definitely doubt
66:32 - that i know there are a lot of you that
66:33 - watch the stream that are just awesome
66:36 - you know uh i'm just i'm a programmer
66:39 - that's willing to
66:42 - show everything that i do and
66:45 - let you all see all my mistakes and
66:46 - everything
66:47 - uh so if there's anything unique about
66:50 - me you're good about my programming
66:51 - that's it it's just i'm
66:54 - uh i'm willing to put it all out there
66:56 - and that might not even be a great idea
66:58 - to do but that's that's what i'm doing
66:59 - and i hope it helps you out
67:02 - and it also in terms of like being a
67:04 - good programmer to be honest with you
67:05 - there's so much information out there to
67:08 - i think it's more accurate to say like
67:10 - this person is really good at this
67:11 - particular thing you know um it's it's
67:15 - so hard to judge like a good programmer
67:17 - you know like what do you measure that
67:19 - by so
67:20 - uh it's more like
67:23 - you know what's your expertise you know
67:24 - certain people are better at certain
67:26 - things and it's it would be
67:30 - i don't know if i want to say impossible
67:32 - because you never know but it'd be
67:33 - really hard for one programmer to be the
67:35 - best at a lot of different things you
67:37 - know so i think the the
67:39 - goal for
67:40 - for those companies that can afford it
67:42 - having a team of programmers who each
67:44 - specialize in certain things is the best
67:46 - way to go and just realize that one
67:48 - person is not going to be able to do it
67:49 - all you know
67:51 - um
67:52 - let's see
67:58 - uh
67:59 - zack kz ack says are you using xjs i am
68:04 - i'm using next
68:08 - uh lamia says hey hey how's it going
68:11 - kushi says
68:13 - remove this warnings
68:16 - uh i'm not sure what warnings you're
68:17 - talking about
68:19 - uh so let let me know and i'll i'll
68:21 - check into it
68:23 - um
68:24 - razva says mob x
68:27 - yeah and i'm not using mobx
68:30 - uh so that would be like for like state
68:32 - management so you could use mobx or
68:34 - redux
68:35 - actually we're not we don't really need
68:37 - that right now it'd be kind of overkill
68:39 - for what we're doing right now
68:41 - since we're using apollo though we can
68:43 - use apollo to do very similar things to
68:46 - which you would be using mobx or redux
68:48 - for so that's probably what we would go
68:50 - with
68:52 - alexandria says what theme do you use
68:54 - this theme is called seti s eti
69:01 - steven says i feel differently it's not
69:04 - that i learn from you as much as i gain
69:06 - an understanding of how you use it at
69:08 - work and that
69:10 - the struggles you have are the same that
69:12 - i have i see the work in
69:15 - the actual work setting gains more
69:18 - insight than just another tutorial it's
69:20 - not that i don't learn stuff it's more
69:22 - job insight on how you work with it cool
69:24 - i i
69:26 - i'm glad you said that stephen i i
69:27 - totally think that that's that's the
69:29 - value of what i do is
69:31 - not necessarily that you'll learn a
69:34 - programming concept you might
69:36 - but the the goal more or less is
69:40 - just to see how
69:41 - how i do things like
69:44 - really at my job you know because there
69:46 - are a ton of tutorials that are
69:47 - pre-recorded and edited and and really
69:50 - kind of efficient
69:52 - that can teach you a certain programming
69:54 - concept better than this stream will
69:57 - but for this stream
69:58 - you know you'll you'll see what my
70:00 - process is actually like i mean i don't
70:02 - know if i'm like the average dev or not
70:05 - i i really have no idea but
70:07 - you at least get a view into how i do
70:09 - things
70:11 - and hopefully you know you'll you may
70:13 - think hey well you know if this guy can
70:15 - get paid full time to be a developer
70:17 - then certainly i can right
70:21 - you know it might help you get a little
70:22 - insight a little confidence you know
70:24 - and uh especially for all you or maybe
70:26 - freelancing or programming on your own
70:29 - remotely or something you don't really
70:30 - have the experience of working with
70:31 - other developers like
70:33 - like
70:34 - pretty much that's been my experience as
70:36 - well
70:37 - so i think it just it's just cool to see
70:39 - how other people do things
70:42 - all right cool so i finished up with all
70:45 - the questions so i'm gonna wrap things
70:46 - up here
70:48 - and thank you all so much for watching
70:51 - oh i got a few more questions let me
70:53 - answer this last question and then i'll
70:54 - wrap things up steven says so how much
70:57 - time outside of work do you spend on
70:58 - work
71:00 - it really depends on what's what's
71:01 - happening
71:04 - um so
71:05 - if i have a side project
71:10 - excuse me if i have a side project that
71:12 - i'm working on then i may spend you know
71:14 - hours every day after work actually
71:17 - doing work like right now i don't have a
71:20 - side project that i'm getting paid for i
71:22 - take that back i have a very minor kind
71:25 - of ongoing like project that i do with a
71:28 - client just like maintenance stuff you
71:30 - know
71:31 - uh but that's only like literally like
71:34 - maybe like a half hour a month or it's
71:37 - less than an hour a month i do on that
71:38 - so that's that's not a big deal
71:41 - uh so at the moment i'm really not doing
71:43 - anything outside of work
71:46 - uh so i'm taking a little break i
71:48 - finished up a different a project so
71:51 - uh we'll see
71:52 - but it just it totally depends on what i
71:55 - happen to be working on
71:58 - uh
71:58 - let's see
72:00 - uh
72:01 - julio says working on project for school
72:04 - setting as well excited to learn thanks
72:06 - for sharing knowledge uh yeah no problem
72:10 - uh
72:11 - rozva says do you like expressjs more
72:14 - than sales.js or adonisjas
72:17 - i like express but i've never used sales
72:19 - or adonis so i i can't really give a
72:22 - fair assessment there
72:24 - so those may be awesome i just don't
72:26 - know i've never used them but i i do
72:28 - like working with this express
72:31 - i've been able to figure
72:32 - everything i've wanted to do with it
72:34 - i've been able to figure out how to do
72:35 - it so
72:37 - i mean i i can't really ask much more
72:39 - from
72:40 - you know a
72:41 - package or framework you know
72:44 - steven says being new to development i
72:46 - find myself working a lot at home
72:49 - yeah i mean it's
72:52 - it
72:54 - i think
72:56 - to be honest with you i would work a lot
72:58 - more from home if i didn't have a wife
73:00 - and kids really because
73:02 - i love what i do and i love learning
73:05 - more and making cool things so i would
73:08 - probably be
73:10 - spending almost all of my time
73:13 - uh developing things like literally i
73:16 - would probably
73:18 - uh if i was trying to be healthy i would
73:20 - have a workout in there which i should
73:22 - every day
73:23 - and i would have time to eat
73:26 - but other than that all my time would
73:28 - probably be spent
73:30 - programming right so
73:33 - it's good to try not to get burnt out
73:36 - and to make sure that you know you have
73:38 - some other aspects to your life just you
73:40 - know kind of manage stress and things
73:41 - like that
73:42 - um
73:44 - so but it's definitely that what that's
73:46 - going to look like is going to be
73:47 - different for different people and
73:49 - whether or not that's healthy is going
73:50 - to be different for different people
73:52 - right so
73:53 - um
73:56 - it's hard to say like overall
73:59 - you know what how many hours or too many
74:01 - hours right because
74:03 - it just it depends on a lot of factors
74:05 - so like for me working all day is not
74:08 - healthy
74:09 - for my family
74:10 - right
74:11 - probably not healthy for me but you know
74:13 - even more so it's not healthy for my
74:15 - family if i didn't have that if i was
74:17 - single
74:18 - you know then maybe it might not be as
74:21 - as big of a deal maybe i could work
74:23 - longer hours and that would that would
74:25 - be fine
74:26 - because it's not like it's work for that
74:28 - long it's something i enjoy doing
74:36 - uh sure i've said step by step explain
74:39 - docker and jenkins please sir um
74:43 - i don't know that i'm
74:45 - that i know enough about docker and
74:46 - jenkins to explain them step by step so
74:49 - you probably don't want me doing that
74:52 - uh
74:53 - maybe try to find some videos um
74:57 - there may be some videos about that on
75:00 - our free code camp youtube channel but
75:02 - check out learn code academy
75:04 - their youtube channel so it's um
75:10 - i can't believe i forget his name i
75:11 - forget the name of the guy who does that
75:12 - channel but the channel name is learn
75:14 - code academy
75:16 - uh will stern i think his name is will
75:18 - stern
75:18 - um
75:20 - i know
75:21 - that will has some videos on docker and
75:24 - i think he has some on jenkins so check
75:26 - those out they're a little bit old but
75:28 - the concepts are still the same so those
75:31 - may help you out
75:32 - uh charles says what are your tips for
75:34 - getting a developer job
75:35 - uh all right so just a few tips
75:39 - i'm not claiming to be an expert here
75:41 - but
75:42 - these are things that i've found are
75:43 - helpful
75:44 - so always be working on projects that
75:47 - you have on github and that you can put
75:49 - up there people can actually see them
75:51 - okay so
75:52 - employers do like to see that you've
75:54 - worked on projects right
75:57 - to definitely do that
75:59 - try to network with as many people as
76:01 - you can if you can meet people in person
76:03 - great if not twitter is a great place to
76:06 - get in touch with other developers
76:10 - you can then if you there's a job at a
76:13 - place where another developer you
76:15 - like let's say you have a relationship
76:16 - with another developer on twitter right
76:19 - and then you notice like hey they work
76:21 - at this company and you want to work
76:22 - there you could then ask them for a
76:24 - recommendation and that recommendation
76:27 - will get you farther right so for
76:29 - instance like at google
76:31 - if you submit an application no one's
76:34 - even going to see it at first it's going
76:35 - to go through their program that kind of
76:37 - weeds people out so a real person may
76:40 - never even see your resume but if you
76:42 - have a recommendation
76:44 - they have a process where that resume is
76:46 - guaranteed to get in the hands of
76:48 - somebody to look at so you've already
76:51 - kind of skipped that first step by
76:53 - having that so that's a great way to
76:55 - kind of get in there
76:59 - then
77:00 - i would say like apply for as many jobs
77:03 - as you can be smart about it don't spend
77:05 - all your time doing that so get on
77:07 - places like linkedin um or
77:11 - like indeed.com uh stackoverflow
77:14 - and set it up so that you can do like
77:16 - the one click apply for jobs
77:19 - so you know have like a generic type of
77:22 - resume and then go through and every job
77:26 - that's one click
77:28 - apply so not every job is going to let
77:30 - you do that but every job lets you do
77:31 - that that's even remotely in your range
77:34 - of skills
77:35 - apply apply to everything it'll only
77:38 - take you a second just to click
77:41 - and
77:43 - that way like hey you you might get in
77:45 - you might get an interview even if you
77:47 - end up not taking that job at least it's
77:48 - good experience to go through the
77:50 - interview process
77:51 - okay so
77:54 - that's my advice if you do find a job
77:56 - that you really really want then there's
77:58 - kind of more strategies that you can
77:59 - take to get that job so
78:01 - like tailoring a project just for that
78:04 - company for that job based on what they
78:06 - do
78:07 - uh you know maybe getting in touch with
78:10 - more people that work there and figuring
78:12 - out you know what you need to do so like
78:15 - but it's in general if you're just
78:16 - trying to get a job and not a like a
78:18 - specific job at a certain company
78:21 - i think the advice i just gave will be
78:23 - okay and there are probably a lot of
78:25 - other things you can do but
78:26 - uh just from the top of my head
78:29 - that that would be my advice
78:34 - okay
78:38 - uh elvis says oops i'm sorry i skipped
78:41 - some questions uh david says how many
78:43 - programming languages do you know i'm
78:45 - new with this i'm learning python now
78:47 - but i want to learn another programming
78:48 - language in the future uh i really i
78:51 - know javascript pretty well
78:53 - i have done things with php with python
78:57 - with
78:58 - c plus plus with c sharp
79:01 - and with java
79:04 - also with solidity
79:08 - yeah and i think that's it
79:10 - so i have a very basic familiarity with
79:13 - a lot of programming languages
79:16 - i wouldn't be confident to say i'm going
79:18 - to build all this stuff but i'm
79:20 - confident enough to say like i could
79:22 - kind of figure out what's going on if i
79:24 - see some of that code
79:27 - but for me i'm focusing on being really
79:30 - good at javascript
79:32 - which
79:34 - seems to me like it will help me in my
79:37 - career more than knowing being like
79:40 - average at a lot of languages or below
79:43 - average in a lot of languages so
79:45 - but it depends on what you want to do
79:46 - with your career so it may make sense
79:48 - for you to learn more than one language
79:52 - but for me i'm like i know a little bit
79:55 - about
79:56 - you know maybe five or so languages and
79:59 - i'm trying to focus mainly on one
80:03 - elvis says what's the best friend in
80:04 - validation you'd recommend
80:07 - um
80:09 - i don't remember we used something
80:13 - on some previous projects i forget what
80:15 - we use so i'm i'm blanking if i remember
80:18 - in the next few minutes i'll let you
80:19 - know but i can't remember what we'd used
80:20 - before i don't remember what it's called
80:23 - check you can check out some of our
80:24 - previous projects on the the github uh
80:27 - repo uh so it's it's linked in the
80:29 - description so if you just check out
80:30 - like the whole github organization and
80:33 - look back at some of the projects maybe
80:35 - you'll find what we've used
80:39 - uh steven says yeah i have a wife and
80:41 - kid it's been hard at times but being
80:42 - the only front-end developer you have to
80:44 - learn it at some point i find that at
80:46 - home i'm a little better at learning new
80:48 - stuff
80:49 - yeah i mean that's um
80:51 - like i said that's just some balance
80:53 - that you're gonna have to make with
80:54 - yourself and you know your family to
80:57 - figure out like what's a reasonable
80:58 - amount of time to spend doing this right
81:00 - because
81:01 - you know you like you need to be able to
81:02 - pay the bills and provide for your
81:04 - family so you need to be good enough at
81:05 - your job that you're going to be able to
81:07 - keep your job and and progress
81:10 - but you also want to actually spend time
81:11 - with your family too so
81:13 - that's a hard balance like i don't have
81:15 - that figured out
81:16 - uh you know we just
81:18 - you should do the best you can i just
81:20 - try to do the best i can and sometimes i
81:21 - do a good job and sometimes i don't
81:24 - so
81:25 - i can't really give
81:27 - a lot of advice other than just keep
81:28 - trying and keep talking your wife and
81:31 - figuring out
81:33 - what's working for her and
81:35 - um
81:37 - you know just try to try to work through
81:39 - that
81:41 - uh
81:43 - ins says uh node.js versus php what's
81:46 - your opinion i'm a rookie back-end i
81:48 - personally prefer node.js to php
81:52 - um
81:53 - but it really depends on what you're
81:54 - trying to do
81:56 - so
81:59 - in terms of learning php
82:01 - like if you get a job that has to do
82:04 - with wordpress or drupal or joomla or
82:07 - anything like that you're gonna need to
82:09 - learn php
82:10 - uh if you have the opportunity to build
82:12 - new stuff and you don't have to worry
82:14 - about all that then i would go with node
82:16 - because if you're gonna be full stack
82:18 - like why not learn node you can only you
82:20 - can learn javascript really well and
82:22 - just use javascript front and back end
82:25 - uh so it yeah it really depends so
82:28 - i mean i don't know all this you know
82:32 - specific details about which one's
82:34 - faster more efficient i don't know about
82:36 - that but i i prefer note
82:41 - stephen says totally was not qualified
82:42 - for this job they took a chance and
82:44 - decided to give me a shot loving the
82:45 - change so much way less stress more
82:48 - freedom to watch it
82:50 - that's cool well i'm glad you like this
82:51 - job and you know
82:53 - uh
82:54 - do your best to keep keep learning i
82:56 - mean if they decided to give you a shot
82:59 - i mean
83:00 - at least they have a little bit of
83:01 - patience right that
83:02 - so hopefully you know they'll let you
83:04 - learn
83:06 - and and start to get really good at it
83:09 - mark lynch says have you ever have you
83:10 - used mongodb before i'm trying to figure
83:12 - out how to build my schema so it's
83:14 - easier to work with can you recommend
83:16 - some vids of yours or others
83:19 - uh also any vids on testing
83:21 - since i know nothing so we have done
83:23 - some stuff with testing on some of my
83:25 - previous videos but i'm no expert on
83:27 - testing we have done some stuff with
83:30 - i don't think we've done it on a video
83:31 - though i think it's on a side project
83:33 - that i work with it so
83:35 - i would say in both cases you probably
83:37 - want to find some other videos
83:39 - check out free code camp uh just do a
83:41 - search through the free code camp videos
83:43 - to see what they have
83:45 - uh i do know that once again will
83:47 - stearns youtube channel called learn
83:49 - code academy
83:50 - does have some videos on and i
83:53 - also believe on testing so you may want
83:54 - to check that out
83:56 - uh with most of his videos they are a
83:58 - little bit kind of older
84:01 - but
84:02 - the concepts are still you know pretty
84:04 - solid so i
84:07 - i like his style and in his videos it
84:10 - helps me out
84:12 - uh aki says what's the demand for vue.js
84:15 - react and angular i'm from a beginner i
84:18 - don't really know
84:19 - to be honest with you there's
84:21 - i would say out of the three
84:23 - react is growing really fast and there's
84:26 - a lot of jobs to react but angular also
84:29 - has a lot of jobs but it's not growing
84:31 - as much so i don't know which one is in
84:33 - first in terms of total jobs react or
84:35 - angular but
84:37 - it's close and it seems like if react's
84:39 - not already in the lead it's going to be
84:40 - in the lead soon
84:41 - vue definitely comes in third in terms
84:44 - of total jobs but it's also growing
84:46 - really fast
84:47 - uh so
84:50 - that's that's my take on it right so i
84:53 - and that's just from what i've seen i
84:55 - haven't really done a lot of research
84:56 - into that so if somebody knows better
84:59 - than that please let us know in the chat
85:02 - okay cool i'm gonna finish up for real
85:04 - this time thank you all so much for
85:06 - watching
85:07 - and uh i'm gonna try i'll probably be
85:09 - able to stream tomorrow i'll be back in
85:11 - the office so um
85:13 - i'm thinking maybe around the same time
85:14 - tomorrow
85:16 - and
85:16 - [Music]
85:18 - yeah so until then have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and i'm really glad to be back i missed you all uh i was in new york city for free code camp top contributor party and then before that i was in salt lake city for react rally so if anybody has any questions about how all that went let me know i can answer that when we do question answer sessions and then at the end of the stream um i am still a little bit exhausted from it all because it was really awesome but i had very little sleep uh from basically like wednesday until yesterday that's a small amount of sleep but i did so much awesome stuff uh and so i'm kind of excited for what we're working on today uh it's it's pretty cool um we're gonna continue on with what we're doing in the last stream so in case you didn't see the last stream i'll give you a quick recap and also uh if if you're totally new and you haven't seen any of my streams let me take a minute just to explain what we do here so i am a fulltime frontend developer employed by a small university and this i live stream my daily work so these projects are projects that i'm actually working on the project we're currently working on is the new main website for the university so it will be franciscan.edu when it launches these are not exactly tutorials although i hope that you all learned something from them i certainly learn a lot from you when i do them and so as you watch it really the value in this is just seeing what what it's like for me as a frontend developer and seeing how many mistakes that i actually make every day and i still manage to keep my job and how i work through those mistakes and and how i make decisions for projects so i do my best to explain things as i go along and feel free to ask you know any questions i don't think i've ever had anybody ask anything that i didn't want to answer so feel free to ask questions pretty much nothing offends me um i think that's it oh so i do pomodoro sessions for the stream so we'll do 25 minutes of coding and i won't really answer questions during that time and then i'll take five minutes to answer questions we'll do another 25 minutes uh session of coding and then at the end of the stream i'll take all the remaining time to answer any questions that you all have so if you ask a question it seems like i'm kind of ignoring you don't worry i'm only ignoring you for a little bit i'll get to you at some point uh okay so here's what we're working on today so we have a react project okay so a website progressive web app that's running react which is a javascript library and we need to create a contact form that when a user fills it out they put in their first name last name email and then whether they want to be uh undergrad graduate or online student at this university we need that data to be sent to salesforce and automatically create a new record for that student uh in our our sales force uh database or you know however you want to call it so last week our last stream we successfully created records okay but we we didn't make the form yet we just kind of did it all and hardcoded it in the back end with in our with node.js in our server.js file okay so today what we're going to do is we're number one we're actually going to create the correct records because if you remember we did get to send data over but it it went to the wrong place so we're going to try to go to the right place this time and we're going to try to actually create the form so that we can fill out the form on the site hit submit and hopefully have it have everything work okay so that's the plan for today we'll see how much of it we can get done and i'm going to go through real quick and just say hi and see if there's any questions i should answer right away before we get started and okay so hey everybody i see some some new people some old people i'm just going to say hi all at once because there's a lot of people saying hi um oh cool uh sore app says they use salesforce a lot to automate stuff awesome so uh maybe you can you can help me out as we're going through this uh what's up um all in all ask what type of job i'm doing i think i kind of explained that let me know if i didn't if you have anything more specific that you'd like to ask um let's see steven asked why i didn't get interviewed at the meet and greet for free code camp we just ran out of time that was all and i kind of wanted to hang back because i figured you all get to hear me talk all the time uh some of the other people you know are just kind of behind the scenes so i figured it'd be cool if they had a chance uh so i kind of waited and thought if we have time i'll get on there otherwise you know y'all can ask me whatever you want okay so let's get started i should show you my screen first that would help all right so here's what i've been working on and let's see all right so the latest thing that i've done that's different from the last time is i've um i've changed out a few things so number one i got these environment variables working so they weren't working the last time and there's a good reason why they weren't working because i didn't require this this dot end okay so i needed to to bring in that package first for this all to work so once i did that now it works so our file with the environment variables now works now what this does mean is if you're working on this project locally this will not work for you so once we get the form up and running if you try to actually submit the form it won't work because you won't have salesforce login info which there's not really anything i can do about that if you wanted to kind of use this on your own project you'll have to have your own salesforce account uh and and set that up and down here what i've done is i've put all this code that we use to send data inside this server.post and the the path now is inquiry hyphen submit so we're going to send from our front end we're going to send a post request to inquiry hyphen submit and then it's going to take that data that we send and it's going to use it here so for now i'm just hard coding because we're going to test it out with some hardcoded stuff just to make sure that it's creating a record in the right place with the right information and i didn't start my pomodoro timer let me start that and uh while we're here i just wanted to show off so a colleague of mine liz uh who's awesome and uh super smart showed me this website that she made when she was i don't know like 10 or 11 so i just wanted to show it off i'm i'm kind of impressed this was from 2001 like i don't even think i had a computer when i was 10 years old so i mean she was already making websites using html i like it so i thought i'd just show that show that off so shout out to liz thank you for sharing and thanks for giving me permission to show this on the stream so if any of you like are struggling with some design ideas you know feel free to use this as an example all right back to the code let me make this a bit bigger for you it's probably way too small i should probably start the server uh you're in dev i think it's dead all right that is probably big enough for now so i think before we were sending we're sending the the data as i don't know what it was it's something else i think the correct thing to send it as is contact so we're gonna hopefully that'll work and i have all the fields here except the last field which is going to be either graduate undergrad or online but i'm not sure what that field is exactly so i'm going to leave that blank for now because that's just going to take me like going through all the fields possible and trying to figure out which one matches up i'm not going to do that on the stream because that's super boring and we don't really need that to prove that this will work right so let me save this uh i was hoping we'd get some auto formatting on this but i guess not yet this is okay though why i really thought we would get a lot better auto formatting anyway i'm just going to change this to single quotes just to get rid of these squiggly lines because they always red squiggly lines always look so angry you know oh now we have some formatting okay cool so our our next step here i guess what we can do now is just like move this out of here and just call it like right away so let's do that so what we'll do is grab basically we'll grab all of this i'm just going to copy it and then paste it here will that work maybe actually let's let's take it out of there i'm gonna put it up here so this should just run right which is we're like automatically just calling all this so this should run as soon as the server restarts and then we can check well we'll see what comes up we should get an error message if it doesn't work so this will be our first check if it works then let's we'll move on and we'll actually create the form okay if not we'll switch it up try to make it work so let's save it this should auto restart all right cool we got some stuff in here invalid login all right then let me i have my end file open on my other screen all right so let me double check that i have the right stuff in there so unfortunately i'm not going to be able to show you this because then you'd have my password so it'll just take a second okay and so just put my password in and now i'm gonna get a security token so when you go to put in your your password here uh that it needs so like up here this is actually going to be if you're trying to do this on your own your salesforce password that you log in with and then you're gonna combine that with your security token and that will be what you use so let me um i'm just going to completely shut this server down for a second and then start it back up we're still getting it invalid username password security token huh all right that's a little bit weird because we this worked before um hmm the only other thing i could think of is uh resetting the security token also why i have this check out this swag i got it reactor alley so apple was there giving out free stuff and so i got a cool cup i have some iced coffee in there right now um all right let's do this so i i do have two different security tokens one of them i thought was invalid and i i thought i was using the right one let me try the other one if neither one of them works then i'll try to create a new security token and i know i have it up somewhere on my other screen sorry i have to do all this on my other screen there's really no no other way around this i think i deleted the email with my security tokens where's the trash there we go deleted items where are you that would have been what day thursday yeah i think we created that first token on thursday oh where is it all right i don't know what happened to it so i guess we're not going to try the old the old one do you know what i may have had it saved let me go back to that info see if i can just go back to the original see if it'll work all right i'm gonna save that now and see this will work hmm oh you know what i know why it's not working and this is silly so um in my mfile originally on the last time we streamed which you know what it wasn't thursday because i was at that conference it was probably monday wow it's been a while so last monday i just named them username and password but when i i redid some stuff in here and i changed the name to salesforce username and salesforce password uh because i thought you know maybe i'll have to put more stuff in this m file and i i want to make sure that it's clear that these are the salesforce username and password so i'm going to change the names here and then everything should work all right and i think i need to type in there we are cool a different error nice all right so here we are we we went in successfully and it looks like we have an invalid field all right i was i was a little bit worried about this there's no such column as first name okay all right let's scroll down here so um all right let me look in salesforce and i'll see if i can show you i'll um i'll pull this over and show you but if there's any student information i can't so actually yeah you know what i i think i may end up looking at student information so i'm not going to show that live uh i'll just like describe what what i'm doing here so my music stopped on spotify so let's go back okay um all right let's bump this down so good all right so let's try to just do this let's say name let's try to run it with this name invalid field why is it still it's still saying first name uh why i just changed that oops you know what i probably changed it in the wrong spot that's why and we uh we copied and pasted it up here so maybe that's why now no that was the right spot all right let's try it again oops oops let me totally shut the server down and start it up oh no i had this one run going too that's why i kept running everything twice let's get rid of that okay okay all right let me check to see if this even you know came in at all all right so i don't think anything was created let me check my time all right we still about nine more minutes until i'll go back and answer questions all right so let me look at this a bit more hmm hmm if i had name or was it capitalized i can't remember if it was originally capitalized or not so i'm going to try it out with being capitalized see if it does makes any difference at all and it doesn't look like it does please check the security settings of this field okay um i wonder if i can add i need to find in salesforce where the state is going all right we might just skip might just skip to the actually making the fields in react because at this point i mean we know we know we're connecting to salesforce the problem is just making sure that we're we have the right keys for our key value pairs uh for our data so that's that's just gonna have to be me going through salesforce and trying to figure out exactly what uh what these keys are because to be honest it's not exactly clear and i'm not the one that set it all up so maybe i just have to get a hold of somebody else uh so let's switch it up a bit and what we can do now is get rid of get rid of this so we don't have this run every time we uh we save something okay all right let's get rid of that and let's go to where's this going to be you know what let's make a totally new component for this because i think we'll have this on on multiple pages so let's go in here and check out our components so our components folder and we're gonna make a new file and we'll call this um inquiry.js because it's going to be the inquiry form and let's just pull in some code from another component maybe let's just pull in the code from this this hero component just something just give us a little boiler plate right and we'll take out we'll probably want grid we'll definitely want button uh styles probably don't need typography we'll leave it in for now though just in case uh all right cool so we can leave that alone we'll come back to these in a minute what i want to do really with this is move this down to the bottom so we've been doing that with all our components moving all our styles down to the bottom so as we as we edit things we're doing that a little bit easier when you first go into the component to figure out what's happening if you don't have to scroll down through all the styles first let's change our name so instead of this component being hero we're going to make it oops not going to be able to do that here we're going to make an inquiry so we have to change it here and then also down here inquiry okay um right now it's we're passing in a lot of props for now i don't anticipate this component having any props so let's get rid of all these props okay and we can get rid of a lot of this so all these options and okay and now within our return we can really get rid of pretty much most of it right almost all of this uh so yeah tell me we have our basic stuff here we're gonna leave let's leave these button styles just in case we um we want to reuse them i'm not going to need this parallax actually now that i think about it there is going to be we're probably going to have one prop but i'm not going to worry about it right now the prop is going to have to do with if we place the form on a section of the website that has a white background we're going to need the button to look different than if we place the form on a section of the website that has a dark background not only the button but all the the color for all the font and everything so those might be the only options we might basically have like a light and a dark theme for this form uh but for now let's just get it get it working so we're going to start out with a grid component and this is going to be container and inside of that we're going to have some more grid stuff so we're going to do a grid and we're going to give it oops that's my timer all right we'll stop here let me take a short break and go to the chat i'm going to scroll all the way up to the top of the chat and try to get through as much as i can steven says that dry erase board is nowhere near big enough just saying so i have a dry eraser behind me you can't see it in this view but yeah actually i haven't used that dry erase board for i prob at least a year so i don't really use it that much i used to like sketch things out on it but i right i just use paper now see uh all in all says all of your courses are really cool thanks for everything you did for free oh you're welcome you're welcome thanks for saying that i appreciate that let's see andre says hello from portugal hey how's it going thanks for joining us let's see um niranjan says hi how to be a frontend developer and what should i have to study um if you want to be a frontend developer i would start out with the free code camp lessons start with those and then kind of branch out from there and supplement with youtube videos and books as you go on but that'll give you like it'll ease you into things very nicely and it'll hit a bunch of topics that you will need to know uh and then figure out what you like and then you can specialize from there but that's that's my advice to get started uh ezekiel says how are you john hanson says uh hi how's the hand uh so my hand if you don't know i had surgery on my wrist a few weeks back and um it still hurts i think it's going to hurt for a couple more months before it's really better so um it's okay i made it through carrying bags and stuff through lots of different airports um and i could do it i mean it hurt but i could do it so in terms of like having the strength to actually do things it's it's there uh so i think i'm gonna try to start like working out a little bit and just see how much i could do uh probably this week so i started back on my my diet again this week and um i'm gonna i'm not gonna be so extreme like the last time i went on a diet i was really trying to lose weight and i dropped like i don't like 15 pounds uh this time i'm i'm not really gonna try to lose weight very fast uh just kind of like kind of slow and maybe just worry just worried about like eating healthy building muscle and things like that but i'm gonna see how much i can do with this wrist for now uh vpool says what's this 93rd part of project 5 or just part 2 of the title okay so it's part two of us working on with the salesforce api but it is the 93rd installment of project five here so yeah we've been working on this for quite a while uh sanjay says hey it's been a while since i caught up with the stream uh what project are you working on currently uh this is the main website for franciscan university so it's a react project um it's using react node wordpress for content management next js so we got some server side rendering going on custom routing so that's that's what we're working on uh john hanson says high five for building a new component cool yeah i think um it's always cool to i think on the stream to build a new component um especially for those who are starting out and are new with react uh because like the more times you go through that process and see it just the more comfortable you'll be with with doing it and for me too like if i get like i haven't really done much coding for the last week so uh i don't want to get too rusty at kind of doing things although i rarely code a component from scratch i'm always copying and pasting things which which i think is a good way to do it it's efficient all right uh neeraj says how do you learn programming um well there's a lot of different ways to start out if you're interested in doing the kind of stuff that i'm doing here i would definitely start with the free code camp exercises so check out freecodecamp.org and go through that uh but there's so many different types of programming it kind of depends on what you want to do so if you let me know what you're really interested in maybe i give you something more specific uh you know somewhere to start out but all right cool so my timer is up and i'm gonna go back now and we're going to do one more pomodoro session working on this before i go back and answer some more questions and that'll probably be the only coding we do for for today it'll just be this next 25 minutes uh so let's go into this grid and now that i'm looking at this i think it's probably easier if i copy and paste some grid stuff from somewhere else so i don't have to try to remember or look up what to say uh extra small classes all right so you extra small i'm trying to find a grid that has everything that we need here um all right i guess i'll just copy this for now and i'll guess at the other one so what i mean in particular is this like for extra small screens we want this to be 12 and then i'm guessing small is the next one let's try uh six for small you'll see why i'm doing this in a second if you're not um sure what what we're doing this for um let's see and then within here this we're going to want to put some form elements so let's check out do i have i guess i don't have any uh any windows here so let me pull over actually i could use this let's pull this out and uh now that i have this dark theme on here i can't see where this corner is there we go all right let's go to material dot ui.com so we're using material ui for a lot of our design for this site it comes with a lot of premade components in the material design style and what we want to find now is our inputs so let's go this is going to show us the api but really what i want is a demo so we want the text field demo first let me make this bigger so you all can see and we can actually make this like really big we'll do full screen and this is what i want i want these components but i want to do the controlled version so i believe it's down here oh maybe they changed it um customized input all right well let's just start with something basic um so we'll just grab i need a placeholder probably not i don't really need a placeholder so we'll just grab a basic text field and we'll move it over oops move it over here and so we want to import this text field component and then we're going to bring in the text field here's what we need and i guess we could put this all within a form or not i don't really think it matters for the way we're doing this but let's check this out for now we'll just bring in a text field and nope okay so our text field here let's clean this up a bit we're going to say given an idea first name and a label of first name and we don't have classes for text field yet i guess we could import those we could copy and paste them over value is going to be this state first first name about we'll just do like this first name like that this one change this handle change first name okay so that looks good let's pull some of this stuff over so we definitely need the handle change and we need our state so let's pull this up and let's see currencies all right we'll get our styles too in just a second and we'll pull those in is that where i'm supposed to do this yeah um we don't need so we have to change these up a bit so we're going to have first first name and then we're gonna end up having last name oops last name and then this will be email and this will be um student type i'm not sure what to call that yet but eventually we will have that and for now these are all just going to be blank and actually did we have an example with control component is that what i just saw uh let's also grab that text field here and pop that down here okay this set state great all right so that should work we don't have classes stewie uh we need to uh set our prob there we go please ask questions if i'm going too fast or skipping through this way too fast but for this this is just going to allow us to instead of having to type this props all the time now we can just type classes it just saves a little bit of space and then if we add any other props which we probably will we can just add them in here and then we can just use them straight away like that so um i believe this is called object destructuring and i think it's an es6 thing all right i'm going to take a breath for a second because i just went a little bit you know fast so i'm going to take a breath and explain a little bit about what's going on here so we have our text field the value of our text field is going to be determined by the value of first name in state but what will happen is when we type in this field on change so every time we type something in here it's going to call this function called handle change and it's going to pass in first name and what this will do is say okay we'll take the name right of whatever input that is because we're going to have more than one and we're going to set state to whatever that value is now so whatever is typed into that input is now going to become the state here in this case our first name state so anytime state changes in react it causes a rerender of the component so it's going to rerender and when this component goes to rerender it's going to say okay what's our value and it's going to look back in state and now our updated value and state is going to be the value for this so that's the way the flow goes when you use a component it's called a a controlled input right uh controlled component right so that the value is actually controlled by the states so a little bit different uh than if you're just have i mean even if you were to control things through javascript maybe if you're using jquery the value would be read and change directly but in this case it's it's state that really gets changed and then everything flows from there so we don't change the value directly we change state state causes state change causes rerender and then value comes from state hopefully that makes a little bit of sense um once you use it a few times if if you're not if you don't already understand what's happening if you use it a few times you'll you'll understand it it makes a lot more sense okay so now that we have that one in here let's copy and paste and we're going to use three of these inputs and we'll just switch up the names here uh so this is this one will be easy we'll just switch it to last name oops last name and then this one will be email okay so let's save that and see what it looks like um so i am i'm running this right yeah so let's go to localhost logo is 3000 and oops we actually need to use this component so let's add this component right onto our home page and see what it looks like so i don't think i have a home page up here let's go to our index and on our index first we'll import this so let's just grab this for now copy and paste it and then change this to inquiry inquiry and then now down here we'll just pick a section let's see what this looks like see we should put it um i guess we could just throw it right below one of these top sections degrees yeah this is going to have its own grid so let's put it inside yeah let's just add it as another text section there's another section here and it's going to be inquiry and we have no props to pass in right now so let's see what happens cool and here it is pretty terrible right now but at least we we have our inputs let's type and we could see hey it's working things things go in there if we really wanted to we could look in devtools and see that the state is actually changing but i'm just going to trust that the state works right now since otherwise we may not even really see anything so great so we have our fields the style of this is awful right now right but we're not worried about the style we want it to work first so let's add our last section in which is going to be a drop down so first we can just make now let's first let's go to material ui uh the documentation again and let's find let's see there's got to be one for drop down or select so that this menu selects there we go so you want to put in one of these selects it's just going to look like this so we're going to do kind of the same thing again i'm going to grab some of these so we'll import this select and select empty i don't know if we'll need that or not yeah and this handle changes actually it's made a little bit different so we'll probably have to change up the way we're doing things hmm i think i might like this way better we'll see if we switch it to that way because then it's one less thing we have to pass in here so let's see we have our actually let's let's get this this whole thing here and we'll probably have to pull over form control as well but we're going to go with another grid there we go and we're going to do the same thing here that we did with the other ones all right these are just the columns so on an extra small screen this will take up 12 out of 12 columns on a small screen and up it will take up only 6 out of 12 columns so it'll be 50 width and then over here 100 width uh we also need to import form control import label and menu item let's go up here and i'll just grab these i don't need the helper text okay we'll just verify that that's actually showing up yep it shows up and see we can check here now we can change things up a bit so our name is going to be we call this student type we'll give it an id of student type and our values um so this will say under undergraduate graduate and online and then we'll replace these undergraduate graduates and online okay all right now you remember i said we're gonna have to change something so currently our handle change is expecting us to pass in the name but what we could do labels first name so here for input pros we are giving it a name of student type all right let's let's just do it then like like this i kind of wanted to switch it up so that the text inputs use the same thing as this one but for now i think this will be the fastest way to get it working student type okay and let's save that oops keep going the wrong way oops i forgot to change age so instead of age let's go with um student type and we need to change it here student type and one more time student type okay whoa and this is way too small let's pull over i guess some of the styles for this i mean maybe the form control will pull over let's see what that does for us there we are okay so now we have this so this is all that we need in terms of inputs for our form we will need a submit button okay and let me check my time oh about five minutes okay uh let's let me grab some code from a previous project to speed things up so in the um the resource center project that we did that was a react project we we have a form on there it's a much more complicated form but we can use the same thing so we had a handle form data so let's put this in here and it's going to be crazy at first right but here's we're going to do handle form data we're going to create a new why is form data is not defined anyway we'll see how much of this we can get working before the timer's up probably not going to get it completely working uh but you know at least we have something on the page now for key values hmm all right see how i had we had the state structured here okay i see so we actually had the form we don't need any of this file stuff right because we're not uploading files okay this will be cool actually to have a a loading thing come up so we'll leave that in even though we don't have this in the page yet we're also going to leave this this fetch in there and our upload url will be for now what did we set it in our server what was this inquiry submit so upload url will be and resubmit okay and we're going to send a post request and then the data we're going to send is just going to be data right so this const this new form data okay and then we're going to do some stuff depending on the response that we get we're going to do some different things open success true cool uh we're gonna have to add in some of this dialogue stuff which i'll probably just copy and paste from so if if you want to check out the full code of what we were doing it's the service request.js is the file name and that's in the resource center project under the views folder so it's service request.js i'll just copy and paste the link in case anybody wants like the big picture of of how it all fits together okay all right cool so the mainly the part the only part in here that i'm really worried about right now that will actually do anything or work at this point is this here right this is going to what's going to send the data to our back end um now this particular way of doing things with the form data it's it's gonna work no matter what we add with a form this small we could probably just hard code like here's what i want to send in there and just form that object ourselves but we'll since this is already in there and it it should work we'll leave it in there what we will need to do though is adjust the way the state is structured here so instead of just state like right off the bat we'll have to say form and then within form then have all these right so it's going to mess up our controlled components for a little bit we'd have to set it and make sure that uh we have uh we're getting the state from the right place see hear the wind pushing yeah this is a lot more complicated if you check out that link you can see that that's a much more complicated form so definitely more than we need for this one and my timer is up so i'm just going to save this for now even though the changes i just made are gonna it doesn't look like it's broken but in reality it it's breaking some stuff behind the scenes uh now i'm gonna go to the chat and i'm going to answer whatever questions remain in the live chat and then we'll finish things up um niraj says how can you help me in programming uh well if you watch this stream i'm sure hopefully you'll pick up something helpful there are a lot of tutorial videos though on this youtube channel that may be more helpful to you if you're just starting out so check those out for sure um jam punks is built from windows now i'm i'm actually developing on a mac right now uh oh oolu i'm really sorry if i mispronounce your name uh let me know how i should pronounce that i'll do my best next time uh but anyway that says what so what exactly you're trying to develop uh in this particular stream i'm trying to create a form that sends data uh to our nodejs backend and then from there it sends the data into salesforce overall for the entire project we're creating a a website for university with react node graphql wordpress for content management so that's that's the overall project victor says you are awesome jesse thank you i appreciate that uh jay charles is here charles says hello how's it going charles let's see david says coding live is the best exercise awesome cool i'm glad you glad you like it it's definitely uh i hope it's useful for you all it's it's so helpful for me i learned so much from you all and just having to explain what i'm doing also makes me really think about like why am i doing it like this and it kind of keeps me like really honest and stops me from stagnating you know like if if there's a better way to do something in a newer way like i'm gonna try to use it uh just to save myself the embarrassment of being caught you know live in front of all of you using uh you know outdated stuff okay um programmer says remove the forum it gives you an error the colon i think programmer i'm i'm not sure i'm not sure exactly what you were referring to then is this when this was here i i assume you're talking about form like form so i know yeah this will cause trouble for now i'll need to adjust some things to get this to work or i can go back and and not do it this way i'll see i'm not sure what i want to do david sands is you are the best programmer here i i kind of doubt i appreciate you saying that but i i definitely doubt that i know there are a lot of you that watch the stream that are just awesome you know uh i'm just i'm a programmer that's willing to show everything that i do and let you all see all my mistakes and everything uh so if there's anything unique about me you're good about my programming that's it it's just i'm uh i'm willing to put it all out there and that might not even be a great idea to do but that's that's what i'm doing and i hope it helps you out and it also in terms of like being a good programmer to be honest with you there's so much information out there to i think it's more accurate to say like this person is really good at this particular thing you know um it's it's so hard to judge like a good programmer you know like what do you measure that by so uh it's more like you know what's your expertise you know certain people are better at certain things and it's it would be i don't know if i want to say impossible because you never know but it'd be really hard for one programmer to be the best at a lot of different things you know so i think the the goal for for those companies that can afford it having a team of programmers who each specialize in certain things is the best way to go and just realize that one person is not going to be able to do it all you know um let's see uh zack kz ack says are you using xjs i am i'm using next uh lamia says hey hey how's it going kushi says remove this warnings uh i'm not sure what warnings you're talking about uh so let let me know and i'll i'll check into it um razva says mob x yeah and i'm not using mobx uh so that would be like for like state management so you could use mobx or redux actually we're not we don't really need that right now it'd be kind of overkill for what we're doing right now since we're using apollo though we can use apollo to do very similar things to which you would be using mobx or redux for so that's probably what we would go with alexandria says what theme do you use this theme is called seti s eti steven says i feel differently it's not that i learn from you as much as i gain an understanding of how you use it at work and that the struggles you have are the same that i have i see the work in the actual work setting gains more insight than just another tutorial it's not that i don't learn stuff it's more job insight on how you work with it cool i i i'm glad you said that stephen i i totally think that that's that's the value of what i do is not necessarily that you'll learn a programming concept you might but the the goal more or less is just to see how how i do things like really at my job you know because there are a ton of tutorials that are prerecorded and edited and and really kind of efficient that can teach you a certain programming concept better than this stream will but for this stream you know you'll you'll see what my process is actually like i mean i don't know if i'm like the average dev or not i i really have no idea but you at least get a view into how i do things and hopefully you know you'll you may think hey well you know if this guy can get paid full time to be a developer then certainly i can right you know it might help you get a little insight a little confidence you know and uh especially for all you or maybe freelancing or programming on your own remotely or something you don't really have the experience of working with other developers like like pretty much that's been my experience as well so i think it just it's just cool to see how other people do things all right cool so i finished up with all the questions so i'm gonna wrap things up here and thank you all so much for watching oh i got a few more questions let me answer this last question and then i'll wrap things up steven says so how much time outside of work do you spend on work it really depends on what's what's happening um so if i have a side project excuse me if i have a side project that i'm working on then i may spend you know hours every day after work actually doing work like right now i don't have a side project that i'm getting paid for i take that back i have a very minor kind of ongoing like project that i do with a client just like maintenance stuff you know uh but that's only like literally like maybe like a half hour a month or it's less than an hour a month i do on that so that's that's not a big deal uh so at the moment i'm really not doing anything outside of work uh so i'm taking a little break i finished up a different a project so uh we'll see but it just it totally depends on what i happen to be working on uh let's see uh julio says working on project for school setting as well excited to learn thanks for sharing knowledge uh yeah no problem uh rozva says do you like expressjs more than sales.js or adonisjas i like express but i've never used sales or adonis so i i can't really give a fair assessment there so those may be awesome i just don't know i've never used them but i i do like working with this express i've been able to figure everything i've wanted to do with it i've been able to figure out how to do it so i mean i i can't really ask much more from you know a package or framework you know steven says being new to development i find myself working a lot at home yeah i mean it's it i think to be honest with you i would work a lot more from home if i didn't have a wife and kids really because i love what i do and i love learning more and making cool things so i would probably be spending almost all of my time uh developing things like literally i would probably uh if i was trying to be healthy i would have a workout in there which i should every day and i would have time to eat but other than that all my time would probably be spent programming right so it's good to try not to get burnt out and to make sure that you know you have some other aspects to your life just you know kind of manage stress and things like that um so but it's definitely that what that's going to look like is going to be different for different people and whether or not that's healthy is going to be different for different people right so um it's hard to say like overall you know what how many hours or too many hours right because it just it depends on a lot of factors so like for me working all day is not healthy for my family right probably not healthy for me but you know even more so it's not healthy for my family if i didn't have that if i was single you know then maybe it might not be as as big of a deal maybe i could work longer hours and that would that would be fine because it's not like it's work for that long it's something i enjoy doing uh sure i've said step by step explain docker and jenkins please sir um i don't know that i'm that i know enough about docker and jenkins to explain them step by step so you probably don't want me doing that uh maybe try to find some videos um there may be some videos about that on our free code camp youtube channel but check out learn code academy their youtube channel so it's um i can't believe i forget his name i forget the name of the guy who does that channel but the channel name is learn code academy uh will stern i think his name is will stern um i know that will has some videos on docker and i think he has some on jenkins so check those out they're a little bit old but the concepts are still the same so those may help you out uh charles says what are your tips for getting a developer job uh all right so just a few tips i'm not claiming to be an expert here but these are things that i've found are helpful so always be working on projects that you have on github and that you can put up there people can actually see them okay so employers do like to see that you've worked on projects right to definitely do that try to network with as many people as you can if you can meet people in person great if not twitter is a great place to get in touch with other developers you can then if you there's a job at a place where another developer you like let's say you have a relationship with another developer on twitter right and then you notice like hey they work at this company and you want to work there you could then ask them for a recommendation and that recommendation will get you farther right so for instance like at google if you submit an application no one's even going to see it at first it's going to go through their program that kind of weeds people out so a real person may never even see your resume but if you have a recommendation they have a process where that resume is guaranteed to get in the hands of somebody to look at so you've already kind of skipped that first step by having that so that's a great way to kind of get in there then i would say like apply for as many jobs as you can be smart about it don't spend all your time doing that so get on places like linkedin um or like indeed.com uh stackoverflow and set it up so that you can do like the one click apply for jobs so you know have like a generic type of resume and then go through and every job that's one click apply so not every job is going to let you do that but every job lets you do that that's even remotely in your range of skills apply apply to everything it'll only take you a second just to click and that way like hey you you might get in you might get an interview even if you end up not taking that job at least it's good experience to go through the interview process okay so that's my advice if you do find a job that you really really want then there's kind of more strategies that you can take to get that job so like tailoring a project just for that company for that job based on what they do uh you know maybe getting in touch with more people that work there and figuring out you know what you need to do so like but it's in general if you're just trying to get a job and not a like a specific job at a certain company i think the advice i just gave will be okay and there are probably a lot of other things you can do but uh just from the top of my head that that would be my advice okay uh elvis says oops i'm sorry i skipped some questions uh david says how many programming languages do you know i'm new with this i'm learning python now but i want to learn another programming language in the future uh i really i know javascript pretty well i have done things with php with python with c plus plus with c sharp and with java also with solidity yeah and i think that's it so i have a very basic familiarity with a lot of programming languages i wouldn't be confident to say i'm going to build all this stuff but i'm confident enough to say like i could kind of figure out what's going on if i see some of that code but for me i'm focusing on being really good at javascript which seems to me like it will help me in my career more than knowing being like average at a lot of languages or below average in a lot of languages so but it depends on what you want to do with your career so it may make sense for you to learn more than one language but for me i'm like i know a little bit about you know maybe five or so languages and i'm trying to focus mainly on one elvis says what's the best friend in validation you'd recommend um i don't remember we used something on some previous projects i forget what we use so i'm i'm blanking if i remember in the next few minutes i'll let you know but i can't remember what we'd used before i don't remember what it's called check you can check out some of our previous projects on the the github uh repo uh so it's it's linked in the description so if you just check out like the whole github organization and look back at some of the projects maybe you'll find what we've used uh steven says yeah i have a wife and kid it's been hard at times but being the only frontend developer you have to learn it at some point i find that at home i'm a little better at learning new stuff yeah i mean that's um like i said that's just some balance that you're gonna have to make with yourself and you know your family to figure out like what's a reasonable amount of time to spend doing this right because you know you like you need to be able to pay the bills and provide for your family so you need to be good enough at your job that you're going to be able to keep your job and and progress but you also want to actually spend time with your family too so that's a hard balance like i don't have that figured out uh you know we just you should do the best you can i just try to do the best i can and sometimes i do a good job and sometimes i don't so i can't really give a lot of advice other than just keep trying and keep talking your wife and figuring out what's working for her and um you know just try to try to work through that uh ins says uh node.js versus php what's your opinion i'm a rookie backend i personally prefer node.js to php um but it really depends on what you're trying to do so in terms of learning php like if you get a job that has to do with wordpress or drupal or joomla or anything like that you're gonna need to learn php uh if you have the opportunity to build new stuff and you don't have to worry about all that then i would go with node because if you're gonna be full stack like why not learn node you can only you can learn javascript really well and just use javascript front and back end uh so it yeah it really depends so i mean i don't know all this you know specific details about which one's faster more efficient i don't know about that but i i prefer note stephen says totally was not qualified for this job they took a chance and decided to give me a shot loving the change so much way less stress more freedom to watch it that's cool well i'm glad you like this job and you know uh do your best to keep keep learning i mean if they decided to give you a shot i mean at least they have a little bit of patience right that so hopefully you know they'll let you learn and and start to get really good at it mark lynch says have you ever have you used mongodb before i'm trying to figure out how to build my schema so it's easier to work with can you recommend some vids of yours or others uh also any vids on testing since i know nothing so we have done some stuff with testing on some of my previous videos but i'm no expert on testing we have done some stuff with i don't think we've done it on a video though i think it's on a side project that i work with it so i would say in both cases you probably want to find some other videos check out free code camp uh just do a search through the free code camp videos to see what they have uh i do know that once again will stearns youtube channel called learn code academy does have some videos on and i also believe on testing so you may want to check that out uh with most of his videos they are a little bit kind of older but the concepts are still you know pretty solid so i i like his style and in his videos it helps me out uh aki says what's the demand for vue.js react and angular i'm from a beginner i don't really know to be honest with you there's i would say out of the three react is growing really fast and there's a lot of jobs to react but angular also has a lot of jobs but it's not growing as much so i don't know which one is in first in terms of total jobs react or angular but it's close and it seems like if react's not already in the lead it's going to be in the lead soon vue definitely comes in third in terms of total jobs but it's also growing really fast uh so that's that's my take on it right so i and that's just from what i've seen i haven't really done a lot of research into that so if somebody knows better than that please let us know in the chat okay cool i'm gonna finish up for real this time thank you all so much for watching and uh i'm gonna try i'll probably be able to stream tomorrow i'll be back in the office so um i'm thinking maybe around the same time tomorrow and yeah so until then have a great day
