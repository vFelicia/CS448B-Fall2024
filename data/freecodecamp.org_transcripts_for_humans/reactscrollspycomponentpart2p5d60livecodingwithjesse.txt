00:06 - hey everybody
00:07 - welcome to live coding with jesse i'm
00:10 - jesse
00:11 - and today
00:13 - we're going to finish the component that
00:14 - we started yesterday
00:16 - i
00:18 - i made a lot of changes so first thing
00:20 - i'm going to do is
00:22 - cover those changes
00:24 - before we get started with the coding
00:27 - this is my first time using the new
00:30 - webcam with my my home office set up
00:34 - so
00:35 - let me know if anything is weird
00:38 - hopefully the picture quality is a
00:39 - little bit better it should be
00:42 - but um
00:46 - i um
00:48 - i'm getting like from from my point of
00:50 - view
00:51 - the audio is way off from the video
00:55 - uh as i see it in obs i'm hoping it's
00:58 - not like that for you all please let me
01:00 - know uh what what it's like for you
01:07 - and my computer is really sluggish while
01:10 - i'm running this okay so the audio and
01:13 - video seem to be out of sync
01:19 - i was afraid that
01:24 - all right let's
01:27 - let me
01:32 - see what i could do i tried to look into
01:35 - how to fix that
01:39 - yesterday
01:46 - but uh i couldn't find
01:50 - i couldn't really find anything that
01:51 - seemed to apply with what was going on
01:54 - yesterday with the stream
01:57 - so while i'm explaining this i'm just
01:59 - gonna check over on my other screen
02:02 - some some options
02:22 - all right it looks like there's there's
02:24 - quite a few um
02:26 - options here
02:27 - to choose from on a google search
02:35 - uh john said time for a new machine
02:39 - yeah i
02:41 - that would be really nice
02:45 - i i do have one other thing that i can
02:47 - try it was just gonna
02:49 - be a lot of extra setup but i can i i
02:52 - can run obs on a different machine
02:56 - and then
02:59 - that would let my computer um my that
03:03 - i'm actually coding on
03:04 - uh it wouldn't have to handle all the
03:06 - load of running obs
03:10 - so
03:12 - uh maybe that'll be my my next step
03:31 - uh it looks like i can set an audio
03:33 - delay
03:42 - yeah maybe i'll um
03:48 - let me add in
03:52 - audio delay
04:05 - let me go to the settings real quick and
04:07 - add that in
04:08 - if this doesn't work
04:10 - um
04:11 - i guess i'll just go to the code
04:15 - let's see
04:17 - all right audio
04:28 - stream
04:29 - or output audio is probably where i need
04:31 - to go
05:21 - sync asset
05:27 - all right let me see if i can
05:31 - add this delay
05:43 - all right
05:46 - is this is this better at all
06:02 - you know what actually let me try
06:07 - can you hear me
06:09 - all right that seems to be
06:14 - so the um
06:16 - the webcam itself has a
06:18 - microphone so i wonder if i switch to
06:20 - that if it'll give it'll be better
06:23 - synced
06:29 - it looks like it's still off from my
06:31 - point of view but
06:34 - i'm not sure
06:43 - alright so i think i so i switched mics
06:46 - to a different mic and i think that i
06:48 - just set a delay of um
06:52 - 300 milliseconds
06:59 - but i'm not exactly sure
07:06 - alright
07:08 - so let me at least show you and explain
07:11 - what
07:12 - what's going on here
07:16 - and
07:18 - maybe i can try to adjust the settings a
07:20 - bit based on
07:22 - on your feedback
07:28 - let me go
07:31 - i'm gonna adjust the settings like
07:33 - drastically
07:50 - all right so in the spot where i
07:53 - think i can add a delay
07:56 - i just added an audio delay of 10
07:59 - seconds
08:04 - all right so it looks say the the volume
08:06 - is dropped
08:08 - okay
08:09 - i am a little bit farther away from the
08:12 - webcam mic
08:14 - let me see if i can adjust the volume
08:32 - all right is the volume any better now
08:41 - all right just keep keep letting me know
08:42 - whether it's getting better or worse and
08:44 - i'll go back to it
08:46 - but for now i
08:48 - i do want to show you what i've done
08:51 - so
08:53 - i'm sure most of you uh remember harshit
08:57 - he's been
08:59 - not in the stream quite as much since
09:00 - i've been streaming later on and it's
09:02 - it's really hard to watch because of the
09:04 - time zone
09:06 - uh difference
09:07 - but
09:09 - heart [ __ ] gave me some good advice
09:13 - to use
09:14 - what's it called react scroll
09:18 - i think that's what it's called yeah
09:20 - react scroll
09:22 - to help with handling the scrolling
09:24 - instead of trying to do it ourselves
09:26 - and
09:28 - you know i really wanted to use what
09:29 - we'd already used in the previous
09:31 - project
09:33 - because i thought that would save us a
09:35 - lot of time but as we saw yesterday
09:37 - it ended up being
09:41 - pretty difficult there were just so many
09:43 - pieces in different places
09:46 - that
09:46 - i i didn't even realize they were there
09:50 - because number one it's been a while
09:51 - since i worked on a project but also
09:54 - most of that work was from a pull
09:56 - request and i didn't do it myself so
10:01 - having seen the code and not actually
10:03 - written it
10:04 - myself
10:06 - it just
10:08 - was a lot harder to try to adapt it so i
10:10 - think this is probably going to be a
10:13 - better way to do it so far it's it's
10:15 - working well
10:17 - so
10:18 - i want to give you
10:20 - just a very brief overview of what we've
10:23 - done in terms of the code and let me
10:25 - make this code a lot bigger
10:28 - that's pretty small
10:36 - wow
10:38 - this is
10:43 - quite
10:44 - slow i see what i'm gonna do actually
10:47 - let me
10:49 - i'm gonna change my display
10:53 - let's see
10:58 - there we go
11:01 - let's change this display let's get rid
11:03 - of this
11:08 - and
11:14 - let's see
11:15 - that looks like it's in sync
11:18 - it's it's much better
11:22 - does that look better to you all
11:29 - so i might just go with this one then
11:36 - and
11:38 - maybe oh um
11:41 - if i just
11:45 - just go with this for now and then try
11:47 - to work out the difference
11:55 - i'm gonna switch back to the normal
11:58 - uh microphone
12:01 - that i usually use and so the audio will
12:04 - be you know back to normal
12:08 - okay
12:09 - that'll be something i just need to work
12:11 - on uh maybe after i stream today if i
12:13 - have time i'll work on getting the
12:15 - the other computer set up to run obs
12:20 - all right so for now
12:23 - let me make some space get rid of this
12:25 - sidebar i don't need that
12:53 - okay john says the video is fine
12:56 - but the sound is out
12:59 - works fine enough
13:02 - sound is now in sync okay awesome
13:05 - all right that's cool
13:06 - i think uh probably my this this laptop
13:10 - is just not powerful enough to handle
13:12 - that
13:12 - and so my audio's
13:14 - just gonna be out of sync so
13:16 - i don't think i'm gonna make it work
13:18 - with um
13:21 - with this computer and that camera
13:26 - so i need to figure some other solution
13:28 - out with another computer
13:31 - all right and
13:35 - now let's get to this
13:37 - i do want to show you all
13:38 - maybe on one of the breaks so remind me
13:41 - if you're interested but i'd like to
13:43 - show you all one of the side projects
13:44 - that uh harshit and nikki have been
13:47 - working really hard on
13:48 - and give you an update on that
13:52 - because we haven't we haven't looked at
13:54 - it in the stream in quite a while
13:58 - okay so
14:00 - here's what we have so far we've brought
14:02 - in well if i can click the right
14:04 - the right component i'll show you what
14:06 - we had so far
14:07 - okay so we imported
14:10 - let me see we actually imported a lot so
14:13 - we imported
14:15 - all of this stuff from react scroll
14:18 - okay so link events
14:20 - animate scroll as scroll
14:23 - and then scroll spy and scroller
14:28 - just as an aside here we are using a
14:32 - component called link on other pages
14:37 - uh and we're getting that from from next
14:40 - if we were to use that component on this
14:42 - page we could import link as something
14:45 - else and that would reduce the confusion
14:48 - so we probably will do that
14:54 - and i forgot to set my timer
14:56 - oh because this area
15:09 - alright so we've added
15:12 - basically everything
15:14 - everything where you see these these
15:16 - blue lines
15:18 - in the green line here this is all added
15:22 - so on component did mount
15:25 - basically um just setting
15:29 - event handlers right in this case the
15:31 - the scroll
15:36 - and then we have some functions that
15:38 - we're not using right now so we'll
15:39 - probably take out but i copied and
15:42 - pasted heavily from the example
15:45 - um if you want to check out react scroll
15:48 - uh let me let me throw a link in here
15:50 - for you
15:51 - i thought i had it here i guess i don't
15:54 - let me grab the link for react scrolls
15:56 - um so that you all can can check out
15:59 - this package
16:04 - there we go so the link's in there now
16:05 - if you click it and it doesn't work
16:07 - please try copying and pasting it
16:13 - okay
16:16 - so we'll probably get rid of scroll to
16:17 - top
16:19 - i don't really see the need for a scroll
16:21 - to top function
16:23 - on this particular page but it's good to
16:25 - know it's there
16:29 - because we should probably use that on
16:31 - the search page
16:33 - and we're definitely using the scroll to
16:36 - function so
16:37 - you could you know scroll to a certain
16:39 - element and you can see you can set
16:41 - different things like duration uh delay
16:45 - uh you can even set like the type of
16:47 - animation
16:49 - so really nice
16:50 - i'm not probably not going to mess too
16:52 - much with the type of animation because
16:54 - that's kind of thing that could
16:55 - get me off track for a while just
16:57 - testing things out and then like the
16:59 - grand scheme of things
17:01 - it's just not that important for this
17:04 - one particular part of the site
17:07 - um
17:08 - let's see
17:11 - let's continue
17:13 - yeah so some of these will have to work
17:16 - out
17:17 - and see like do we really need
17:19 - we're only using one type of scroll so
17:21 - we may not need some of these
17:24 - and then of course when the component
17:26 - unmounts wait we remove our
17:29 - event listeners
17:33 - now in terms of
17:35 - markup
17:37 - we've added this
17:39 - i've added this div i put in some inline
17:42 - styles in the div but they're not
17:43 - working for me right now so that's the
17:45 - number the first thing we're going to
17:46 - work on are these styles to get it in
17:48 - the right location
17:51 - but we just have an unordered list
17:55 - and then within each list item we have
17:57 - that link component not to be confused
18:00 - with the one we've used elsewhere from
18:02 - next
18:03 - this is the link component we're getting
18:04 - from react scroll
18:06 - and we've just set
18:08 - our class is active so when we're
18:11 - scrolled in that
18:13 - particular spot
18:15 - so
18:16 - when we're inside that component that
18:18 - element on the page that has an idea of
18:20 - spring
18:22 - then this link is going to have the
18:24 - class of active
18:27 - and we can attach and i have attached uh
18:30 - css classes
18:32 - to that
18:36 - right now i just have spring and summer
18:42 - oh sorry
18:44 - uh but we'll end up with you know all
18:46 - the seasons so we'll have four
18:48 - four links
18:51 - and
18:52 - the only other change that i needed to
18:54 - make was
18:56 - in our container so it's the second
18:59 - content container
19:03 - we changed
19:04 - why
19:05 - i changed this
19:07 - id i should say i added the id of spring
19:12 - and then i added in another container
19:13 - below that and gave it the id of summer
19:16 - just so that we had two to work with to
19:19 - test
19:22 - all right so all in all
19:25 - once we get rid of everything we don't
19:26 - need i think this will end up being
19:29 - less code
19:31 - um
19:32 - and it'll be more centralized in one
19:34 - place i mean yes we're bringing in a
19:35 - whole another npm package but in terms
19:38 - of like cluttering our components way
19:40 - less clutter
19:48 - all right
19:49 - now let me show you what it looks like
19:53 - so
19:58 - let me go to
20:00 - missionary outreach
20:19 - okay so right now
20:21 - i can't even see it
20:23 - so something i did with the styles are
20:25 - really messing things up
20:29 - so i'm gonna inspect here
20:32 - because i know in the markup it's it's
20:34 - right below this
20:36 - so even though we can't see it on the
20:37 - page it's it's obviously still going to
20:39 - be in the same place in the markup so
20:41 - that's where we're going to search for
20:42 - it we'll mess with the styles a bit
20:44 - right here in devtools
20:46 - and see if we can figure out you know
20:48 - what to do i think
20:51 - i pulled over the styles from our other
20:53 - project that resource center project
20:55 - it's uh it's
20:57 - rc.franciscan.university if anybody
20:59 - wants to check that out
21:00 - and uh i believe it's the
21:04 - planning guide page would be slash
21:06 - planning hyphen guide
21:08 - and i think we had that menu
21:11 - positioned
21:13 - uh
21:14 - yeah let me make this bigger we had that
21:18 - menu positioned like in our
21:21 - in our dom tree we had it
21:25 - like up at
21:27 - one of the higher levels
21:33 - so i think that made a difference
21:39 - so i'm just gonna get rid of a lot of
21:41 - these styles
21:43 - right now just to see does that make any
21:45 - difference at all
21:47 - and we could see
21:48 - it does not
21:50 - so the one thing that i think
21:52 - is messing this up is
21:56 - this
21:59 - position fixed
22:02 - but if we wanted to behave in in the
22:04 - appropriate way we need that
22:10 - sorry for the yawning
22:13 - i've um
22:16 - i've been having like
22:19 - uh i've been so drowsy tired all day i
22:22 - uh
22:23 - i thought i was gonna fall
22:24 - asleep uh so let me just click it just
22:27 - to show you
22:28 - right so when you click it
22:30 - it does take you to the right section
22:34 - so that works i did have to use an
22:35 - offset
22:37 - of negative 50 pixels so we could still
22:39 - see this because the id is actually on
22:41 - this container and not on
22:44 - on the title because we want the scrolls
22:46 - by to detect that it's inside of this
22:49 - container the whole way down when we're
22:51 - scrolling otherwise it would just very
22:53 - briefly have the class of active and
22:55 - then once this was off the screen it
22:57 - would go away that would be no good
23:02 - all right you know what and
23:04 - nikki says give it a ridiculous z index
23:06 - just to be sure all right let's let's
23:08 - try that let's put put all these back on
23:11 - and then give it a z index
23:15 - uh
23:18 - big z index
23:23 - actually you can see where is it
23:26 - it it looks like it's putting it way
23:28 - down in the bottom
23:33 - uh let's see if we go
23:41 - see if it puts it
23:43 - ah yes
23:45 - okay
23:48 - all right so it it needed at least we
23:50 - can see it on the screen so
23:53 - uh right here in the corner let me
23:56 - make this bigger so
24:00 - it'll be easier so here in the corner we
24:03 - have this spring and summer
24:11 - but really what we need
24:20 - this is kind of odd i don't know if you
24:22 - can see this but the background color is
24:24 - is off here
24:26 - it's white here and then it's at off
24:28 - white i don't know what's going on with
24:30 - that you know what i think uh the
24:32 - student that's working on this page
24:34 - brought over a bunch of styles from the
24:36 - html css version of the page that he did
24:39 - first and i think some of them are
24:41 - conflicting
24:44 - so
24:45 - uh there's there's a few areas where the
24:47 - styles are a little off
24:51 - it's not really a big deal we'll get
24:53 - that sorted out
24:59 - okay
25:06 - i guess what i'm thinking is
25:16 - we may have talked about this yesterday
25:24 - is that this menu won't
25:26 - this menu will stay here on the page
25:30 - so it you won't see it it won't go up
25:32 - here as you scroll
25:35 - so here's how i think we can make that
25:37 - happen you all please let me know
25:40 - if you have a better idea i'm definitely
25:44 - open to suggestions
25:46 - so
25:46 - by default
25:49 - this will be
25:52 - positioned here on the page
25:55 - uh so i think we can
25:58 - how can we accomplish that
26:01 - we'll get into the css of that in just a
26:03 - second but then
26:05 - since we already have the scroll spy set
26:06 - up we'll just check out
26:08 - there's got to be a way to make
26:10 - something happen
26:12 - um
26:13 - like fire off a function that we create
26:17 - when we get to a certain place
26:20 - or
26:22 - change something we got to be able to
26:23 - change something when we get to that
26:25 - certain spot
26:27 - and at that point the styles will change
26:30 - so that this goes to
26:33 - something very similar to what it is
26:34 - right now
26:39 - so let's
26:48 - let's go back to the code
26:52 - so i think we can do this
26:54 - [Music]
27:04 - all right if we have
27:14 - oh
27:15 - nikki saying use position sticky
27:25 - yeah is that
27:26 - what's the support for position sticky
27:29 - let's check that out
28:00 - hmm
28:20 - all right well
28:23 - i mean obviously internet explorer 11
28:27 - is not supporting it
28:32 - i'm not really that worried about
28:34 - internet explorer 11.
28:39 - i've told you all how i feel about it if
28:41 - anybody once really wants to know ask me
28:43 - and i'll answer it at the end of the
28:44 - stream
28:45 - um
28:50 - yeah so i'm not going to worry about
28:52 - internet explorer 11 for right now
28:57 - let's try position sticky
28:59 - and i don't know that i've ever used
29:01 - this before i remember
29:03 - someone bringing it up on the stream
29:04 - before and we checked it out but i don't
29:06 - know if i ever used it if i did i forgot
29:09 - um
29:10 - so let's play around with it
29:20 - i don't know where it went
29:24 - let's just look up um
29:29 - what
29:30 - yeah i'm pretty sure i'll get a link
29:32 - right to mdn from here there we go
29:42 - oh polyfills
29:44 - maybe we can't make this work
29:50 - all right here's our sticky position if
29:52 - you haven't used mdn before i highly
29:55 - recommend it so it's the mozilla
29:57 - developer network anytime you search for
30:00 - anything in html css javascript and
30:04 - who knows what else
30:05 - the
30:06 - mdn uh article on that will probably
30:10 - probably be one of the top search
30:12 - results uh so it's it's very thorough
30:16 - if you're a beginner it could be a
30:18 - little intimidating because there's so
30:19 - much information
30:21 - for beginners i recommend if if you're
30:24 - confused by all this
30:26 - scroll down to the examples and check
30:28 - out the examples first
30:30 - for me starting out and even now
30:33 - the examples sometimes make it clear to
30:35 - me
30:36 - immediately whether or not this is going
30:38 - to work
30:39 - and then if i think it'll work and i'm
30:41 - interested i'll go back and read
30:43 - and
30:44 - learn what i what i need to about it
30:47 - but otherwise it can take some time to
30:50 - get through everything and try to figure
30:52 - it all out
30:55 - um
30:56 - so
30:57 - let me just uh
30:59 - go through this quickly
31:01 - i'm not gonna read it out i'm just gonna
31:02 - glance at it
31:29 - all right
31:43 - let's go down to the sticky area
31:57 - all right this sounds perfect for us a
31:59 - stickly positioned element is treated as
32:01 - relatively positioned until across
32:03 - crosses
32:05 - specified threshold
32:07 - at which point is treated as fixed it's
32:10 - exactly what we were going to try to
32:12 - implement ourselves with javascript
32:19 - okay
32:31 - which one
32:40 - one is all right so which one has the id
32:43 - of one
32:51 - i don't see it in there
32:54 - all right let's see
32:57 - oh
32:59 - okay
33:02 - i like that that's nice
33:11 - okay
33:16 - i just see that uh frankie just joined
33:19 - us welcome
33:20 - thanks for joining us don't worry about
33:22 - being late
33:28 - all right so let's try it out uh it
33:30 - seems like all i really need is
33:33 - this position sticky and then
33:35 - like a value from the top
33:38 - so let's go back here
33:42 - and let me get rid of
33:50 - that was weird that max with is messing
33:52 - things up
33:54 - oh
33:57 - can you believe it it works just like
33:59 - that
34:03 - that's amazing
34:05 - check that out
34:11 - wow
34:15 - that's cool all right a few things
34:18 - that don't want to try here
34:22 - okay so
34:23 - uh when it really is position fixed
34:26 - it's nice that it doesn't take up this
34:28 - space here so i want to do something
34:30 - about that
34:34 - um
34:38 - i definitely don't want it taking up so
34:41 - much space
34:50 - i don't know if you all can hear that
34:52 - but my phone just keeps going off
34:54 - constantly
34:56 - um
35:01 - okay i do have some work messages let me
35:03 - just check and make sure it's not
35:05 - emergency
35:19 - okay there is a change i need to make
35:24 - to the bulletin website
35:27 - but i don't think it needs to be made
35:28 - until the end of the week
35:30 - all right so no no emergencies
35:35 - okay
35:37 - thanks for being patient check that out
35:40 - all right so let's see
35:47 - interesting
35:49 - um
36:00 - all right so this position right it's
36:02 - not working let's see if we can do
36:07 - there we go
36:08 - nice all right so i know floats are old
36:12 - school but in this case a float does
36:13 - exactly what we wanted to
36:16 - so
36:17 - we're gonna go with the float and then
36:19 - we're gonna put a
36:21 - margin
36:22 - right
36:26 - margin
36:27 - if i can't get this right here we go
36:29 - right of 16
36:32 - pixels okay i always like to have at
36:34 - least 16 pixels here because you can see
36:37 - we have this scroll bar that shows up
36:41 - and
36:42 - on browsers where this happens
36:46 - uh we definitely want enough space so
36:48 - you can still read and click on these
36:52 - i believe internet explorer scroll bar
36:55 - is like always there
36:57 - and it's big
36:58 - so
37:00 - i know we're not really trying to
37:01 - support it but
37:04 - something small like that i think is
37:08 - it's definitely worth doing because you
37:10 - never know how browsers look to on
37:12 - different
37:13 - um
37:15 - operating systems so i think this scroll
37:17 - bar is like the slimmest one and
37:20 - on windows i believe they're a little
37:21 - bit thicker
37:24 - all right wow that was
37:29 - that was super
37:31 - easy
37:32 - uh i guess
37:37 - what's going on here this is
37:40 - it's not exactly working
37:44 - something happened and it's not working
37:47 - so that active class is not working
37:49 - right
37:51 - uh but let me check the time
37:55 - all right only about two minutes uh
37:57 - let's
38:00 - let's get these styles over into a css
38:03 - file
38:05 - quickly
38:08 - so i'm just going to copy these and
38:10 - we'll do the position sticky so this
38:12 - will be
38:14 - i'm just using this
38:15 - missions.css that we already had
38:20 - and
38:21 - let's start
38:24 - um
38:25 - actually i had that on the div and that
38:27 - div doesn't have a class right now
38:29 - we need to give that dave a class
38:39 - let's get rid of these styles
38:42 - and give it a class name
38:46 - of
38:48 - um
38:53 - scroll spy container
39:17 - position sticky and then we'll paste
39:20 - this
39:26 - in i don't have auto formatting set up
39:30 - for my css unfortunately
39:33 - i have to manually do that
39:36 - there we go
39:41 - um
39:42 - all right cool let's
39:44 - i don't think we changed anything else
39:48 - let's give it a refresh
39:50 - just to be sure
39:52 - uh the styles don't
39:54 - auto refresh so when i change the uh
39:57 - like the css files
40:13 - it's taking quite a while
40:18 - why is that happening
40:25 - uh i think i messed something up here
40:36 - all right no none of those errors would
40:38 - be able to explain it
40:40 - okay let me take a five minute break i'm
40:43 - gonna go to the live chat and answer
40:45 - some questions and when we come back
40:46 - we're gonna troubleshoot
40:50 - the stuff that i've apparently broken
40:56 - okay i didn't notice right off at the
40:59 - very beginning of the stream tova says
41:01 - hello first time here um if you're still
41:03 - here jova welcome to the stream thank
41:06 - you so much for uh for joining us today
41:09 - sorry about all the technical
41:11 - difficulties at the beginning
41:31 - oh phoenix said earlier there's a weird
41:33 - noise let me know if there still is a
41:35 - weird noise
41:36 - i mean there shouldn't
41:40 - i don't hear anything now nobody is
41:42 - home at my house so if you hear
41:44 - something weird
41:46 - let me know again
41:49 - yeah i can't hear anything
41:55 - uh james ross asked if there's any
41:57 - update uh with uh my kids brain project
42:01 - um
42:03 - so
42:05 - the last thing that happened with that
42:06 - project was i i had a
42:10 - video
42:11 - call with
42:13 - alex castillo
42:16 - and
42:18 - he works with brain computer computer
42:20 - interfaces and javascript
42:23 - and
42:23 - he does presentations on it at different
42:26 - conferences he used to work at netflix
42:28 - and he has his own company now that are
42:31 - is focusing on the brain computer
42:32 - interfaces
42:34 - so he
42:35 - he was working on
42:39 - making the link so we did some testing
42:41 - to try to get the
42:43 - brain computer interface
42:45 - connected via bluetooth directly to a
42:47 - website right through the through the
42:49 - browser
42:50 - uh and we were successful at getting
42:52 - that to work
42:54 - um i did send him some some test data so
42:58 - he's going to try to work with that to
43:00 - get a link
43:01 - so that the data can be readable
43:04 - so
43:05 - i've no idea how long that's going to
43:07 - take in the meantime
43:10 - i can probably start working on like the
43:12 - front end of it
43:14 - and just
43:16 - basically like mocking
43:18 - data
43:19 - um
43:20 - so
43:22 - i'm hoping to get started on that soon
43:25 - it's i mean it's it's there's just
43:27 - always things going on you know there's
43:28 - always things to do so
43:31 - hopefully i'll get to that it is kind of
43:33 - high on my list so
43:36 - oh i will update you all as as we go on
43:56 - uh john soto says um question uh why not
44:01 - use scroll into view
44:06 - um
44:06 - we could use that
44:10 - since we are already using
44:13 - this package to
44:16 - um
44:17 - to track the the scroll
44:20 - i'm just using the tools that are
44:21 - available uh there
44:24 - uh to move the
44:26 - to do the scrolling
44:28 - so
44:30 - i think this is the case where there's a
44:31 - lot of different ways to do this
44:33 - and i don't know if this weighs the best
44:35 - way
44:37 - uh but so far it is it seems to be
44:40 - working
44:44 - uh john
44:45 - soto if there's any particular reason
44:48 - why you think strolling into view would
44:49 - actually be the better way to go please
44:51 - let me know because i'm i'm definitely
44:52 - interested in doing this
44:55 - you know the best way i can
45:03 - uh john hanson says bringing over a
45:04 - pre-made react package can be great
45:06 - though i find that you have to put
45:08 - trust in the dev of that package
45:11 - yeah for sure for sure i think that's i
45:14 - mean that's an issue i think everybody
45:16 - deals with now there are very few like
45:18 - large-scale projects where everything's
45:20 - built
45:21 - from scratch i mean
45:23 - like anybody using react for a project
45:25 - is trusting the devs behind react it's
45:28 - just
45:28 - um
45:29 - i don't know that's just the way
45:32 - web development is now
45:34 - uh for better or for worse we're all
45:36 - able to build really cool things and
45:39 - and build on
45:40 - you know what everyone else is working
45:42 - on
45:43 - it's really awesome it's great
45:44 - collaboration but at the same time
45:47 - yeah it does require that trust so
45:51 - i guess um
45:52 - it is a good idea to at least
45:55 - look at the package a bit look at the
45:57 - github repo
45:58 - uh see some of the issues what have
46:00 - people said about it how many people are
46:02 - actually using it
46:04 - um
46:05 - you know see
46:06 - basically if there's anything that just
46:08 - looks weird
46:10 - in terms of
46:12 - you know does nobody use this maybe
46:14 - there's a reason why nobody uses it um
46:16 - are there a ton of issues that
46:19 - that never get closed
46:21 - that's probably a warning sign too so
46:24 - at the end of the day though you're
46:25 - right you just you have to trust that
46:27 - the people that made the package uh did
46:30 - a good job
46:32 - and uh you know definitely make sure to
46:34 - test things out on your own
46:36 - um and not just trust that it's it's
46:38 - always gonna work
46:54 - uh
47:02 - okay let me
47:11 - let me start this and let's go
47:15 - oh okay i broke everything so let's
47:17 - check that out first
47:19 - and see why
47:22 - why it's broken now
47:24 - probably because i've messed up the
47:26 - width
47:29 - [Music]
47:34 - um
47:36 - shoot
48:07 - this just seems
48:29 - all right let me
48:40 - i think that
48:41 - maybe the float right is what's doing it
48:57 - see
49:06 - while i'm waiting for that to reload i'm
49:08 - just gonna go through
49:10 - okay
49:11 - all right that did work now
49:13 - um some of the functionality we needed
49:16 - i think because i think we have all the
49:18 - functionality now it it scrolls with a
49:21 - page
49:23 - but only when we want it to
49:26 - you click a link
49:28 - and it goes to the right section
49:34 - oh
49:34 - we're still missing
49:38 - that change
49:40 - in
49:43 - when we have that active class
49:45 - so that was something that was working
49:47 - before i started the stream so something
49:49 - that i've done since then has has
49:52 - changed it
49:53 - um
49:55 - so that plus
49:57 - this positioning is
50:01 - what we need to uh we need to fix
50:06 - all right
50:08 - let me
50:11 - i'm gonna save this i'm gonna try one
50:13 - more time just to see like what
50:19 - what's going on is this this is it
50:21 - always gonna happen and it looks like it
50:23 - is
50:25 - okay
50:32 - oh
50:35 - nice
50:36 - all right cool it um
50:38 - it worked this time
50:59 - all right excellent
51:02 - um at some point we may not get to it on
51:05 - this stream but we'll definitely want to
51:07 - make sure that that
51:08 - side
51:09 - navigation goes away
51:15 - we don't really have room for it on a
51:17 - smaller screen
51:24 - all right
51:26 - all right cool
51:27 - all right so now that's that's sorted
51:30 - and we need
51:32 - i need to figure out why the active
51:34 - class is not being applied here so let
51:37 - me inspect this
51:38 - so we can see
51:40 - if it's being applied
51:44 - let's see so it should be on
51:53 - i think it'll be applied here on the a
51:55 - tag
52:00 - okay yeah so it is being applied it's
52:03 - just the css that needs to change
52:08 - okay
52:10 - and that makes sense because the styles
52:12 - are actually on the li right now
52:20 - okay
52:40 - oops
52:43 - all right let's check it out
53:02 - it'd be nice if i could get the class to
53:04 - apply here but i don't think it's going
53:06 - to work like that
53:12 - nikki just said it looks like masonry is
53:14 - just being a bit slow on this machine
53:16 - yeah i think you're right
53:18 - um it's just
53:20 - this this machine just can't handle
53:24 - streaming very well
53:29 - hmm
53:43 - john said looks like this coding session
53:44 - has been conquered
53:45 - almost we're close we're really close
53:49 - okay so if i
53:53 - all right let me ask this is there a way
54:00 - in css
54:04 - to where i could change the style
54:08 - of a parent
54:10 - if the child has a certain class added
54:16 - i don't i don't know if that's even
54:17 - possible
54:23 - let's let's go to google
54:45 - i know you can do it on
54:51 - uh what is it
54:52 - like hover and stuff like that
55:11 - so
55:23 - hmm
55:36 - all right john's saying that styled
55:38 - components would work really well here
55:41 - because we could just switch the
55:42 - attribute name with javascript
56:00 - hmm
56:08 - uh actually let me let me uh to look at
56:11 - this from a different uh perspective
56:13 - here
56:14 - so
56:18 - i want to try two things one is nikki's
56:21 - idea and it's uh what if we move the
56:23 - link component outside the allies
56:26 - we'll try that first that seems to be
56:28 - the most straightforward thing if it
56:29 - works then great we're done
56:32 - if that doesn't work then what i want to
56:34 - do is
56:35 - let's move the styles onto the a tags
56:38 - and see if we can get a similar effect
56:41 - by putting the styles on the a tag
56:52 - whoa nikki there's a parent selector
56:58 - no way how did i not know about that
57:19 - oh wait a second
57:22 - is there really a parent selector or is
57:24 - that just a suggestion
57:26 - from css tricks
57:49 - all right i'm looking it up right now on
57:51 - can i use on the other screen
58:25 - all right i don't think that's it i
58:26 - think uh i found the um
58:29 - johnny says yes there's a parent
58:30 - selector
58:33 - all right let's try it then
58:50 - seems like it's not but a lot of people
58:52 - want it
58:53 - yeah i want it
58:56 - all right let's
59:00 - let's try moving this around
59:38 - this is gonna be really weird i don't
59:40 - think i don't know if this will work
59:44 - i'm just gonna try with one just to save
59:46 - time
59:51 - did it refresh it
60:03 - i don't think it did let me refresh
60:35 - okay
60:36 - john says the parent selector will be
60:38 - out in css4
60:44 - all right so i guess i can't use it yet
61:16 - hmm
61:27 - oh you know what i didn't
61:30 - the css is still not
61:32 - not right
61:34 - so it it did work and
61:37 - you know that we now have an li inside
61:40 - of this a tag
61:42 - which
61:43 - [Music]
61:46 - actually that
61:47 - that's weird but it works
61:50 - um
61:53 - so we need to have li
61:59 - senior dev a active
62:02 - l i
62:06 - there we go
62:16 - okay
62:19 - that looks like it will work
62:22 - so
62:25 - really wish i didn't have to reload this
62:27 - again but i do
62:28 - it's just so slow
62:30 - i'll check my time while we're waiting
62:32 - all right about 10 minutes
62:34 - i think 10 minutes is more than enough
62:36 - to fix this problem
62:39 - hopefully
62:56 - all right i'm checking out the live chat
62:58 - while i'm waiting for that to load
63:00 - nikki says disclaimer i've never
63:02 - actually used position sticky uh just a
63:05 - possible answer for the problem you
63:07 - should do what you want
63:09 - good to know thanks for that
63:11 - because also the css tricks article on
63:13 - something uh is also a great resource i
63:16 - go to that when mdn starts to confuse me
63:18 - which is often okay that's that is good
63:21 - css tricks is um is pretty good all
63:24 - right cool check that out so we have
63:27 - when we're not on that area we don't
63:29 - have that little border and now when we
63:31 - scroll to it hey there's that little
63:33 - border
63:35 - perfect
63:38 - perfect all right
63:41 - nice
63:46 - really cool
63:49 - all right i like that um i'm thinking
63:51 - maybe the colors could be different
63:54 - uh we're not really using that yellow
63:56 - color in this site so we may want to
63:58 - change that
64:00 - um
64:01 - you may
64:03 - may or may not want to use the gold
64:04 - color for this
64:06 - you know maybe we'll go with
64:08 - you might want to go with uh regular
64:10 - color text with gold on the side
64:13 - um
64:14 - green text with gold on the side i mean
64:16 - there's a lot of combinations so i'm
64:18 - probably not going to get into that for
64:20 - this stream
64:22 - i mean it's pretty basic just changing
64:24 - hex colors on
64:26 - on text here
64:28 - um
64:31 - yeah all right very cool so what i do
64:33 - need to do though is to go back in and
64:36 - make sure i change the markup for that
64:38 - second link
64:39 - as well
64:44 - so
64:45 - that was i believe nikki's idea to put
64:48 - the
64:49 - li inside of the
64:52 - link tag and that was a great idea
64:56 - honestly i thought it would not work
64:59 - but
65:00 - it was such a straightforward change
65:02 - that it was definitely worth the try and
65:05 - it turned out that it did work
65:10 - for some reason my auto formatting is
65:12 - not correcting this mess that i just
65:14 - made
65:17 - um
65:18 - probably when i go to commit it'll get
65:20 - corrected so i'm not going to worry
65:22 - about it
65:24 - but i do want to
65:26 - wait for the refresh just to make sure
65:28 - it's working
65:30 - and i don't think it'll work
65:33 - to go down here because the page isn't
65:35 - long enough i can't actually scroll into
65:37 - the section
65:38 - so i won't be able to test that out
65:41 - but we
65:42 - see if we can see
65:46 - yeah it it won't work
65:49 - right now
65:50 - so if i add some like demo content to
65:53 - this section we can see if it'll work
65:55 - but i'm i'm pretty confident that it
65:57 - will i tested it out earlier with
66:00 - some different stuff and i was getting a
66:02 - change in the
66:05 - uh in the classes for each section
66:09 - and we can see like the the allies here
66:12 - so these look the same now
66:14 - all right
66:16 - let's save that and
66:20 - let's do a git status
66:25 - what why is my
66:27 - chrome bouncing
66:30 - what does it want to tell me i don't
66:32 - know
66:33 - um
66:34 - let's do uh commit now
66:38 - yeah this looks good
66:47 - okay cool
66:48 - um
66:52 - i think there's some low dash stuff we
66:54 - can get rid of
66:56 - like the four each
66:58 - i believe in the map values
67:03 - you know i want to i we can for sure get
67:05 - rid of the four each but i do want to
67:07 - double check about map values so maybe
67:09 - i'll um
67:12 - maybe i'll wait and double check that uh
67:14 - later on before i just get rid of it
67:18 - uh but for now
67:20 - we can do a git add
67:24 - and
67:27 - and we'll run through our
67:35 - yarn
67:45 - so we're going to add a feature and this
67:47 - we add
67:51 - um
67:54 - completed
68:15 - all right i added the word completed in
68:17 - there because i think i may have made a
68:18 - commit already that said we added this
68:21 - um
68:22 - when we had just added
68:24 - some of it and it didn't work yet
68:27 - so while that goes through all the tests
68:29 - and everything i'm going to go over to
68:30 - the live chat
68:32 - and start answering some questions
68:36 - so let me scroll up to where i left off
68:55 - uh devin says you should listen to
68:58 - everything everything spring summer
69:01 - winter dread while you work on this
69:05 - oh i have to
69:07 - all right i'll have to look that up
69:09 - i don't think i've heard that
69:17 - nikki said is it bigger than 16 pixels
69:20 - on windows i think that's let's talk
69:21 - about the scroll bar
69:23 - um
69:25 - devin says i.e scroll bar i thought we
69:27 - were dropping support
69:29 - yeah
69:30 - windows ie for sure has a big scroll bar
69:32 - but i think on windows in general every
69:35 - browser has a big scroll bar
69:46 - it's been a while since i've used
69:47 - windows so i'm i'm not 100 sure but
69:50 - i think the last time i tested on
69:53 - windows which is probably the last time
69:55 - we launched something new
69:57 - uh i i think
69:59 - there were large scroll bars even on on
70:01 - chrome
70:04 - devin says will this even be usable on
70:05 - ie can you just target ie and show a sub
70:08 - nav for spring summer at the top
70:10 - yeah we'll see i'm i'm not even going to
70:12 - try to make it 100 usable and ie
70:16 - uh i mean like think about this is like
70:18 - one page on an entire site that's gonna
70:20 - have thousands of pages
70:22 - most likely
70:24 - um
70:25 - i'm okay if one menu looks a little bit
70:28 - weird
70:31 - i'd actually it would be cool to see
70:32 - what it falls back to
70:34 - i mean i am interested in trying it on
70:36 - internet explorer just to see what
70:38 - happens
70:39 - there's got to be some like fallback
70:41 - position
70:42 - does it fall back to fixed
70:44 - in that case it'll still work it'll just
70:47 - look weird
70:48 - um
70:50 - when it's uh
70:52 - you know in the hero section
71:16 - devin says mixing
71:17 - top and margin right seems weird to me
71:20 - yeah it it definitely is weird uh it
71:23 - there's some weirdness going on with the
71:25 - styles and markup for this component so
71:30 - i think
71:33 - had i made it from scratch instead of
71:35 - importing a little bit from previous
71:37 - projects
71:39 - i maybe wouldn't have done it like that
71:45 - but um
71:47 - this works
71:50 - so i'm definitely
71:54 - i say i'm i'm pretty sure that there's
71:56 - probably a
71:57 - better way to do it
71:59 - um it probably wouldn't
72:01 - look different to the user
72:03 - and it probably wouldn't result i guess
72:06 - i tried to save that webpage
72:09 - all right that's why
72:10 - chrome was bouncing
72:12 - yeah so i i don't know that it would be
72:14 - worthwhile
72:16 - for me to really worry about
72:18 - about that at this point so i mean just
72:21 - to be clear i think writing good code
72:23 - and writing the best solutions is
72:25 - important but
72:27 - you don't always have time for that
72:29 - like i don't think i could
72:32 - make sure all this code is as close to
72:34 - perfect as possible
72:36 - and still get it launched on time
72:39 - uh so what we have to settle for then is
72:42 - does it work
72:43 - and is the code at least reasonable
72:46 - um
72:48 - you know and i
72:51 - that's that's my experience
72:53 - you know with actually working on
72:54 - projects with deadlines and things is
72:56 - that you just
72:57 - you just have to do it sometimes so
73:00 - but anyway i i entirely agree that
73:02 - setting the marge
73:05 - works but the reason we had to do that
73:07 - obviously was because of the float right
73:09 - so
73:10 - um
73:13 - we need that
73:15 - offset
73:17 - for the scroll spy
73:19 - uh so you can see that come into play
73:21 - like so we need that top value
73:23 - uh for the
73:25 - i'm sorry for the sticky so you can see
73:27 - that come into play of this 50 pixels
73:29 - down
73:31 - but then we also need the margin
73:34 - since we decided to use the float
73:38 - which is pretty weird to use with top as
73:40 - well that's why we needed that margin
73:43 - so
73:45 - definitely weird but it gets the job
73:47 - done
73:50 - and i think yeah it went through
73:52 - everything
73:54 - so i also fixed the test i remember
73:56 - yesterday i was saying that the tests
73:57 - were like taking forever so um
74:01 - i believe it was nikki that found
74:04 - the commit where i broke everything
74:07 - and so i was able to go back and um
74:11 - and change everything at some point i
74:13 - made a commit that reverted to an older
74:16 - version of the package json file i'm not
74:18 - exactly sure how that happened but it
74:20 - was about five days ago
74:22 - and so all this week this past week the
74:25 - tests have been acting weird
74:27 - that was why
74:30 - so now it's all worked out we have our
74:32 - test back
74:34 - and
74:35 - they run quickly
74:38 - so i'm going to run a get push to make
74:40 - sure that is on github
74:44 - so you all can check that out if you'd
74:46 - like
74:48 - a link to the github repo is in the
74:50 - description
74:52 - uh frankie s if i'm feeling better today
74:54 - oh thanks for asking frankie
74:57 - this morning i felt good
75:01 - but then after a couple hours my energy
75:03 - was just gone
75:04 - and um
75:06 - actually i was actually felt so good
75:07 - this morning i was thinking about
75:08 - working out i ended up not and just
75:10 - started work
75:12 - like right away
75:14 - uh i did have to take the kids to school
75:16 - so i got the kids ready and i took them
75:17 - to school and um
75:20 - i don't know i still might work out i'm
75:21 - thinking about it
75:24 - i just don't want to go i i don't feel
75:26 - 100 but i don't want to go too long
75:27 - without a workout because i know like
75:29 - with my depression
75:31 - if i go too long without working out
75:33 - i'll get depressed so
75:36 - even though my legs are still sore from
75:38 - my last workout that was two days ago
75:41 - it would be better for my mental health
75:43 - i think if i just do it so hopefully
75:45 - i'll do it
75:46 - and uh
75:47 - but i think this uh this antibiotic that
75:50 - i'm on is is starting to help the
75:51 - congestion is almost completely gone
75:55 - uh so
75:57 - i'm glad it i'm glad it seems like it's
75:59 - it's working because i
76:01 - honestly i've had this on and off i
76:03 - don't know what it is
76:05 - some type of
76:06 - virus or something i don't know on and
76:08 - off for
76:10 - it seems like
76:12 - months uh who knows how long it really
76:14 - was but it just seems like it's been so
76:15 - long
76:16 - um
76:18 - but hey i appreciate you asking thank
76:20 - you
76:23 - oh john says try out right 18 pixels
76:29 - all right i'll try that i'm not going to
76:30 - try it right now i want to test first i
76:32 - think it looks okay with 16
76:36 - but i'm not opposed to bumping out a bit
76:38 - more if we need to especially for
76:41 - people using windows
76:58 - uh nikki says i also thought it wouldn't
77:01 - work so flipping the lis and the link
77:03 - tags
77:04 - um so that the allies inside the link
77:07 - so you're saying
77:08 - thought that wouldn't work what are the
77:10 - implications of not having the
77:13 - uli structure
77:16 - but a ul
77:19 - a structure
77:21 - a city truth i don't know but
77:24 - we may want to think about that i think
77:28 - visually there's not going to be any
77:30 - implications but for screen readers
77:32 - there might be
77:34 - i maybe i'll have to look at that
77:37 - i'm wondering
77:40 - yeah i mean based on the position and
77:42 - the markup that's actually a really good
77:44 - position i think for screen readers
77:45 - because it's like a sub menu that comes
77:49 - comes in there
77:51 - we'll have to see i mean maybe i might
77:52 - just have to
77:54 - try out just the basic
77:56 - screen reader that comes like on a mac
78:00 - and see what it says when it gets to
78:01 - that point
78:06 - i mean they'll still show up as link
78:08 - tags
78:11 - so user would know that it's it's a link
78:17 - i wonder how misleading anchor tags are
78:19 - for screen readers right because if they
78:21 - show up as
78:23 - a link
78:27 - would a screen reader just describe it
78:28 - as a link like to another page
78:31 - when it's really not it's just the link
78:33 - to a different spot in the same page
78:35 - like what happens when that jump happens
78:37 - does the screen reader also jump down
78:39 - i'm getting kind of off topic here but
78:41 - that's
78:43 - that's really interesting i just don't
78:45 - know
78:48 - you know what is doing that
78:51 - is jumping to a different section in the
78:52 - same page even a good idea for
78:55 - accessibility
78:57 - i don't know i need to learn more about
78:59 - that
79:00 - there's like a whole world of
79:02 - you know making your website more
79:04 - accessible that
79:06 - you know i just don't know enough about
79:26 - um john's pretty sure that li is not
79:29 - needed on uo
79:31 - uh also says chrome used to have an
79:32 - experimental flag to make a skinny
79:34 - scroll bar that shows wider when hovered
79:38 - not smart to develop with that flag on
79:42 - yeah why
79:44 - i mean i could see it would be easier to
79:45 - actually click a wider scroll bar to
79:48 - scroll up and down but
79:50 - i don't know i think that would be
79:51 - annoying for trying to develop stuff
79:53 - with that you're basically changing the
79:55 - width
79:57 - the window with
79:58 - on hover that's not
80:03 - i mean it's only a couple pixels that
80:04 - depending on where your break points are
80:06 - that could totally like make your whole
80:08 - layout reflow just on hover
80:17 - oh okay nikki said
80:21 - i i do have something in my package.json
80:23 - so i have a jest key that i need to
80:26 - remove
80:29 - but also says it's not a huge deal since
80:31 - it's not used now okay so i'll
80:33 - it's not hurting anything then to be
80:35 - there so i'll
80:37 - remove it at some point i guess
80:40 - uh
80:43 - yeah
80:44 - thanks for letting me know about that
80:46 - though that saved me so much time
80:48 - um you know earlier when you when you
80:51 - showed the commit where all that changed
81:03 - uh arthur says
81:05 - hey jesse i'm learning front-end
81:07 - development my problem is that i switch
81:09 - between html css and javascript as
81:12 - priorities i try to create a small
81:15 - javascript project but stop at designing
81:18 - but again
81:20 - uh
81:21 - i get sleepy while learning html css all
81:24 - that best practices and cool stuff
81:27 - um yeah
81:31 - i guess in terms of priorities it's
81:38 - i mean you you need to know
81:40 - you need to know all of it i mean i
81:42 - focus i
81:43 - depending on what you want to do i mean
81:45 - i would focus more on javascript
81:48 - you will pick up
81:50 - your html and css more along the way uh
81:53 - those to me seem to be more simple
81:55 - especially html there's some tricky
81:58 - things to css if you really want to get
82:00 - into it there are some people doing
82:01 - really complex things with css and
82:03 - really cool things
82:04 - but for most of us
82:06 - you know we don't need to be at that
82:08 - level uh for for a lot of the sites that
82:11 - we make so
82:13 - you're probably better off focusing on
82:15 - your javascript and then instead of
82:17 - getting like bogged down in the styles
82:20 - just use a framework like like bootstrap
82:23 - or materialize or if you're doing react
82:25 - you know you could use material ui or
82:27 - you know whatever other framework that
82:30 - way uh you won't get as distracted by
82:32 - the styles in the ui
82:35 - because so much of it is done for you
82:38 - and then maybe have
82:40 - you could maybe possibly set a rule for
82:42 - yourself that you get the site build all
82:44 - the functionality done first
82:46 - before you style
82:49 - um
82:50 - and then that way
82:51 - you know maybe you won't get
82:53 - you know stuck
82:54 - in in that section so
82:57 - i'm not i'm not 100 sure that that's
82:59 - your issue but
83:02 - uh sometimes that that helps me
83:06 - just
83:07 - not get too caught up in designing first
83:10 - because you could end up designing for
83:12 - elements and features that don't even
83:14 - make it into your site
83:16 - and then it ends up being you
83:18 - know a waste of time i mean you always
83:21 - learn from it but
83:23 - you know it did would take up a lot of
83:25 - your time that could otherwise be used
83:27 - to
83:28 - you know add more functionality to your
83:30 - um to your project or
83:33 - you know do more testing and things so
83:36 - um
83:37 - hopefully that that helps
83:41 - all right that's that's it for the um
83:44 - for the live chat and uh we basically
83:47 - accomplished what we set out to which is
83:49 - awesome so
83:50 - uh i i was a little bit bold and i wrote
83:53 - in the description
83:54 - to the video
83:57 - it was either in the description of the
83:59 - video or in my tweet about it i wrote
84:01 - that i will be completing
84:03 - uh this uh scroll spy nav today
84:08 - so when i wrote it i thought like uh
84:10 - what if i don't complete it i'm gonna
84:12 - i'm gonna feel silly but we did we
84:14 - completed it so that's pretty cool
84:16 - um okay arthur has some follow-up here
84:19 - uh i read a lot of articles
84:22 - watch courses and sometimes don't create
84:24 - a single project yeah i like design and
84:26 - want my projects to look good i struggle
84:28 - mostly with layouts and responses
84:30 - yeah yeah arthur definitely check out
84:33 - some of the frameworks that i mentioned
84:35 - because it'll take care a lot of the
84:36 - respon of the responsiveness
84:39 - i mean it's good to know how that works
84:41 - and writing media queries and things but
84:43 - it's a type of thing that you really
84:44 - only only want to do from scratch once
84:46 - and then either copy what you did for
84:48 - other projects or use a framework
84:51 - because it can be tedious
84:53 - and i think unnecessarily tedious i
84:55 - don't think there's a lot of value in
84:57 - recreating a whole layout system every
85:01 - single time
85:02 - unless you're doing something really
85:03 - experimental um
85:06 - then it's better off just to use
85:08 - something pre-made in in that case uh
85:11 - something thoroughly tested you know
85:15 - um yeah and make sure
85:16 - really try to do projects i mean it
85:20 - i get into the same thing sometimes
85:21 - where
85:22 - i read a lot of stuff i watch courses
85:25 - and things like that
85:26 - but um
85:29 - uh try to make sure that you're also
85:31 - working on projects maybe split up your
85:33 - time
85:35 - to say like okay i'm gonna spend this
85:36 - much time each day working on a project
85:39 - even if it don't get anywhere like i'm
85:41 - i'm gonna give it a good try and then
85:43 - you can go to your your other resources
85:46 - because it's important to actually be
85:48 - the building
85:49 - as well
85:52 - all right arthur says thanks for
85:53 - answering you're welcome arthas i have
85:55 - that bad feeling do it from zero yeah
85:58 - don't worry nobody does it from zero
86:00 - don't worry about that i used to feel
86:02 - the same way um especially when i was
86:04 - learning like i gotta do it all from
86:06 - scratch
86:07 - but nobody does it from scratch like we
86:08 - were talking about earlier in the stream
86:10 - like
86:11 - if you're building a react project
86:13 - how much work has already been done by
86:15 - the react team at facebook like so much
86:18 - work there's no such thing as from
86:21 - scratch for a react developer
86:23 - um
86:24 - you know there's
86:26 - so in so many things it's not just react
86:29 - if you're using angular if you're using
86:31 - vue
86:32 - uh if you're using any type of testing
86:34 - you know framework uh you know whatever
86:38 - even if you're just using um
86:40 - some boilerplate html code like
86:43 - unless you wrote it yourself and are
86:45 - copying it from a
86:46 - former project like
86:48 - still so i mean we all we all build on
86:51 - uh what others have done
86:54 - and that's i think a good thing
86:56 - uh so
86:58 - so don't worry too much about that
87:01 - as long as you can produce good work um
87:05 - you know
87:06 - i i'd say it's totally fine to rely on
87:12 - you rely uh you know somewhat on the
87:14 - work of others
87:18 - and um
87:23 - frankie says thanks sensei
87:25 - you're welcome i think it's so fun that
87:27 - you uh do you call me sensei
87:31 - um
87:32 - all right
87:33 - okay so i'm gonna end the stream now
87:36 - i've definitely put in um more than my
87:39 - normal amount of time working today and
87:41 - my kids are home from school
87:42 - um
87:44 - so i'm gonna
87:45 - see them and hopefully get a workout in
87:48 - i should be back tomorrow i will be in
87:49 - the office tomorrow we we have like some
87:52 - sort of drill
87:53 - for um in case there's some emergency on
87:56 - campus and it's in the afternoon so i'm
87:59 - going to try not to stream during the
88:01 - time when we're supposed to have the
88:02 - drill because i don't i don't want to
88:04 - have to leave my office in the middle of
88:05 - a stream
88:06 - so i'm thinking maybe in a stream early
88:09 - in the day
88:10 - so early in the day eastern time
88:13 - so just as a heads up to you all
88:15 - um
88:17 - yeah so anyway thanks all thanks

88:30 - all the time
88:31 - and
88:32 - until tomorrow have a wonderful day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to finish the component that we started yesterday i i made a lot of changes so first thing i'm going to do is cover those changes before we get started with the coding this is my first time using the new webcam with my my home office set up so let me know if anything is weird hopefully the picture quality is a little bit better it should be but um i um i'm getting like from from my point of view the audio is way off from the video uh as i see it in obs i'm hoping it's not like that for you all please let me know uh what what it's like for you and my computer is really sluggish while i'm running this okay so the audio and video seem to be out of sync i was afraid that all right let's let me see what i could do i tried to look into how to fix that yesterday but uh i couldn't find i couldn't really find anything that seemed to apply with what was going on yesterday with the stream so while i'm explaining this i'm just gonna check over on my other screen some some options all right it looks like there's there's quite a few um options here to choose from on a google search uh john said time for a new machine yeah i that would be really nice i i do have one other thing that i can try it was just gonna be a lot of extra setup but i can i i can run obs on a different machine and then that would let my computer um my that i'm actually coding on uh it wouldn't have to handle all the load of running obs so uh maybe that'll be my my next step uh it looks like i can set an audio delay yeah maybe i'll um let me add in audio delay let me go to the settings real quick and add that in if this doesn't work um i guess i'll just go to the code let's see all right audio stream or output audio is probably where i need to go sync asset all right let me see if i can add this delay all right is this is this better at all you know what actually let me try can you hear me all right that seems to be so the um the webcam itself has a microphone so i wonder if i switch to that if it'll give it'll be better synced it looks like it's still off from my point of view but i'm not sure alright so i think i so i switched mics to a different mic and i think that i just set a delay of um 300 milliseconds but i'm not exactly sure alright so let me at least show you and explain what what's going on here and maybe i can try to adjust the settings a bit based on on your feedback let me go i'm gonna adjust the settings like drastically all right so in the spot where i think i can add a delay i just added an audio delay of 10 seconds all right so it looks say the the volume is dropped okay i am a little bit farther away from the webcam mic let me see if i can adjust the volume all right is the volume any better now all right just keep keep letting me know whether it's getting better or worse and i'll go back to it but for now i i do want to show you what i've done so i'm sure most of you uh remember harshit he's been not in the stream quite as much since i've been streaming later on and it's it's really hard to watch because of the time zone uh difference but heart [ __ ] gave me some good advice to use what's it called react scroll i think that's what it's called yeah react scroll to help with handling the scrolling instead of trying to do it ourselves and you know i really wanted to use what we'd already used in the previous project because i thought that would save us a lot of time but as we saw yesterday it ended up being pretty difficult there were just so many pieces in different places that i i didn't even realize they were there because number one it's been a while since i worked on a project but also most of that work was from a pull request and i didn't do it myself so having seen the code and not actually written it myself it just was a lot harder to try to adapt it so i think this is probably going to be a better way to do it so far it's it's working well so i want to give you just a very brief overview of what we've done in terms of the code and let me make this code a lot bigger that's pretty small wow this is quite slow i see what i'm gonna do actually let me i'm gonna change my display let's see there we go let's change this display let's get rid of this and let's see that looks like it's in sync it's it's much better does that look better to you all so i might just go with this one then and maybe oh um if i just just go with this for now and then try to work out the difference i'm gonna switch back to the normal uh microphone that i usually use and so the audio will be you know back to normal okay that'll be something i just need to work on uh maybe after i stream today if i have time i'll work on getting the the other computer set up to run obs all right so for now let me make some space get rid of this sidebar i don't need that okay john says the video is fine but the sound is out works fine enough sound is now in sync okay awesome all right that's cool i think uh probably my this this laptop is just not powerful enough to handle that and so my audio's just gonna be out of sync so i don't think i'm gonna make it work with um with this computer and that camera so i need to figure some other solution out with another computer all right and now let's get to this i do want to show you all maybe on one of the breaks so remind me if you're interested but i'd like to show you all one of the side projects that uh harshit and nikki have been working really hard on and give you an update on that because we haven't we haven't looked at it in the stream in quite a while okay so here's what we have so far we've brought in well if i can click the right the right component i'll show you what we had so far okay so we imported let me see we actually imported a lot so we imported all of this stuff from react scroll okay so link events animate scroll as scroll and then scroll spy and scroller just as an aside here we are using a component called link on other pages uh and we're getting that from from next if we were to use that component on this page we could import link as something else and that would reduce the confusion so we probably will do that and i forgot to set my timer oh because this area alright so we've added basically everything everything where you see these these blue lines in the green line here this is all added so on component did mount basically um just setting event handlers right in this case the the scroll and then we have some functions that we're not using right now so we'll probably take out but i copied and pasted heavily from the example um if you want to check out react scroll uh let me let me throw a link in here for you i thought i had it here i guess i don't let me grab the link for react scrolls um so that you all can can check out this package there we go so the link's in there now if you click it and it doesn't work please try copying and pasting it okay so we'll probably get rid of scroll to top i don't really see the need for a scroll to top function on this particular page but it's good to know it's there because we should probably use that on the search page and we're definitely using the scroll to function so you could you know scroll to a certain element and you can see you can set different things like duration uh delay uh you can even set like the type of animation so really nice i'm not probably not going to mess too much with the type of animation because that's kind of thing that could get me off track for a while just testing things out and then like the grand scheme of things it's just not that important for this one particular part of the site um let's see let's continue yeah so some of these will have to work out and see like do we really need we're only using one type of scroll so we may not need some of these and then of course when the component unmounts wait we remove our event listeners now in terms of markup we've added this i've added this div i put in some inline styles in the div but they're not working for me right now so that's the number the first thing we're going to work on are these styles to get it in the right location but we just have an unordered list and then within each list item we have that link component not to be confused with the one we've used elsewhere from next this is the link component we're getting from react scroll and we've just set our class is active so when we're scrolled in that particular spot so when we're inside that component that element on the page that has an idea of spring then this link is going to have the class of active and we can attach and i have attached uh css classes to that right now i just have spring and summer oh sorry uh but we'll end up with you know all the seasons so we'll have four four links and the only other change that i needed to make was in our container so it's the second content container we changed why i changed this id i should say i added the id of spring and then i added in another container below that and gave it the id of summer just so that we had two to work with to test all right so all in all once we get rid of everything we don't need i think this will end up being less code um and it'll be more centralized in one place i mean yes we're bringing in a whole another npm package but in terms of like cluttering our components way less clutter all right now let me show you what it looks like so let me go to missionary outreach okay so right now i can't even see it so something i did with the styles are really messing things up so i'm gonna inspect here because i know in the markup it's it's right below this so even though we can't see it on the page it's it's obviously still going to be in the same place in the markup so that's where we're going to search for it we'll mess with the styles a bit right here in devtools and see if we can figure out you know what to do i think i pulled over the styles from our other project that resource center project it's uh it's rc.franciscan.university if anybody wants to check that out and uh i believe it's the planning guide page would be slash planning hyphen guide and i think we had that menu positioned uh yeah let me make this bigger we had that menu positioned like in our in our dom tree we had it like up at one of the higher levels so i think that made a difference so i'm just gonna get rid of a lot of these styles right now just to see does that make any difference at all and we could see it does not so the one thing that i think is messing this up is this position fixed but if we wanted to behave in in the appropriate way we need that sorry for the yawning i've um i've been having like uh i've been so drowsy tired all day i uh i thought i was gonna fall asleep uh so let me just click it just to show you right so when you click it it does take you to the right section so that works i did have to use an offset of negative 50 pixels so we could still see this because the id is actually on this container and not on on the title because we want the scrolls by to detect that it's inside of this container the whole way down when we're scrolling otherwise it would just very briefly have the class of active and then once this was off the screen it would go away that would be no good all right you know what and nikki says give it a ridiculous z index just to be sure all right let's let's try that let's put put all these back on and then give it a z index uh big z index actually you can see where is it it it looks like it's putting it way down in the bottom uh let's see if we go see if it puts it ah yes okay all right so it it needed at least we can see it on the screen so uh right here in the corner let me make this bigger so it'll be easier so here in the corner we have this spring and summer but really what we need this is kind of odd i don't know if you can see this but the background color is is off here it's white here and then it's at off white i don't know what's going on with that you know what i think uh the student that's working on this page brought over a bunch of styles from the html css version of the page that he did first and i think some of them are conflicting so uh there's there's a few areas where the styles are a little off it's not really a big deal we'll get that sorted out okay i guess what i'm thinking is we may have talked about this yesterday is that this menu won't this menu will stay here on the page so it you won't see it it won't go up here as you scroll so here's how i think we can make that happen you all please let me know if you have a better idea i'm definitely open to suggestions so by default this will be positioned here on the page uh so i think we can how can we accomplish that we'll get into the css of that in just a second but then since we already have the scroll spy set up we'll just check out there's got to be a way to make something happen um like fire off a function that we create when we get to a certain place or change something we got to be able to change something when we get to that certain spot and at that point the styles will change so that this goes to something very similar to what it is right now so let's let's go back to the code so i think we can do this all right if we have oh nikki saying use position sticky yeah is that what's the support for position sticky let's check that out hmm all right well i mean obviously internet explorer 11 is not supporting it i'm not really that worried about internet explorer 11. i've told you all how i feel about it if anybody once really wants to know ask me and i'll answer it at the end of the stream um yeah so i'm not going to worry about internet explorer 11 for right now let's try position sticky and i don't know that i've ever used this before i remember someone bringing it up on the stream before and we checked it out but i don't know if i ever used it if i did i forgot um so let's play around with it i don't know where it went let's just look up um what yeah i'm pretty sure i'll get a link right to mdn from here there we go oh polyfills maybe we can't make this work all right here's our sticky position if you haven't used mdn before i highly recommend it so it's the mozilla developer network anytime you search for anything in html css javascript and who knows what else the mdn uh article on that will probably probably be one of the top search results uh so it's it's very thorough if you're a beginner it could be a little intimidating because there's so much information for beginners i recommend if if you're confused by all this scroll down to the examples and check out the examples first for me starting out and even now the examples sometimes make it clear to me immediately whether or not this is going to work and then if i think it'll work and i'm interested i'll go back and read and learn what i what i need to about it but otherwise it can take some time to get through everything and try to figure it all out um so let me just uh go through this quickly i'm not gonna read it out i'm just gonna glance at it all right let's go down to the sticky area all right this sounds perfect for us a stickly positioned element is treated as relatively positioned until across crosses specified threshold at which point is treated as fixed it's exactly what we were going to try to implement ourselves with javascript okay which one one is all right so which one has the id of one i don't see it in there all right let's see oh okay i like that that's nice okay i just see that uh frankie just joined us welcome thanks for joining us don't worry about being late all right so let's try it out uh it seems like all i really need is this position sticky and then like a value from the top so let's go back here and let me get rid of that was weird that max with is messing things up oh can you believe it it works just like that that's amazing check that out wow that's cool all right a few things that don't want to try here okay so uh when it really is position fixed it's nice that it doesn't take up this space here so i want to do something about that um i definitely don't want it taking up so much space i don't know if you all can hear that but my phone just keeps going off constantly um okay i do have some work messages let me just check and make sure it's not emergency okay there is a change i need to make to the bulletin website but i don't think it needs to be made until the end of the week all right so no no emergencies okay thanks for being patient check that out all right so let's see interesting um all right so this position right it's not working let's see if we can do there we go nice all right so i know floats are old school but in this case a float does exactly what we wanted to so we're gonna go with the float and then we're gonna put a margin right margin if i can't get this right here we go right of 16 pixels okay i always like to have at least 16 pixels here because you can see we have this scroll bar that shows up and on browsers where this happens uh we definitely want enough space so you can still read and click on these i believe internet explorer scroll bar is like always there and it's big so i know we're not really trying to support it but something small like that i think is it's definitely worth doing because you never know how browsers look to on different um operating systems so i think this scroll bar is like the slimmest one and on windows i believe they're a little bit thicker all right wow that was that was super easy uh i guess what's going on here this is it's not exactly working something happened and it's not working so that active class is not working right uh but let me check the time all right only about two minutes uh let's let's get these styles over into a css file quickly so i'm just going to copy these and we'll do the position sticky so this will be i'm just using this missions.css that we already had and let's start um actually i had that on the div and that div doesn't have a class right now we need to give that dave a class let's get rid of these styles and give it a class name of um scroll spy container position sticky and then we'll paste this in i don't have auto formatting set up for my css unfortunately i have to manually do that there we go um all right cool let's i don't think we changed anything else let's give it a refresh just to be sure uh the styles don't auto refresh so when i change the uh like the css files it's taking quite a while why is that happening uh i think i messed something up here all right no none of those errors would be able to explain it okay let me take a five minute break i'm gonna go to the live chat and answer some questions and when we come back we're gonna troubleshoot the stuff that i've apparently broken okay i didn't notice right off at the very beginning of the stream tova says hello first time here um if you're still here jova welcome to the stream thank you so much for uh for joining us today sorry about all the technical difficulties at the beginning oh phoenix said earlier there's a weird noise let me know if there still is a weird noise i mean there shouldn't i don't hear anything now nobody is home at my house so if you hear something weird let me know again yeah i can't hear anything uh james ross asked if there's any update uh with uh my kids brain project um so the last thing that happened with that project was i i had a video call with alex castillo and he works with brain computer computer interfaces and javascript and he does presentations on it at different conferences he used to work at netflix and he has his own company now that are is focusing on the brain computer interfaces so he he was working on making the link so we did some testing to try to get the brain computer interface connected via bluetooth directly to a website right through the through the browser uh and we were successful at getting that to work um i did send him some some test data so he's going to try to work with that to get a link so that the data can be readable so i've no idea how long that's going to take in the meantime i can probably start working on like the front end of it and just basically like mocking data um so i'm hoping to get started on that soon it's i mean it's it's there's just always things going on you know there's always things to do so hopefully i'll get to that it is kind of high on my list so oh i will update you all as as we go on uh john soto says um question uh why not use scroll into view um we could use that since we are already using this package to um to track the the scroll i'm just using the tools that are available uh there uh to move the to do the scrolling so i think this is the case where there's a lot of different ways to do this and i don't know if this weighs the best way uh but so far it is it seems to be working uh john soto if there's any particular reason why you think strolling into view would actually be the better way to go please let me know because i'm i'm definitely interested in doing this you know the best way i can uh john hanson says bringing over a premade react package can be great though i find that you have to put trust in the dev of that package yeah for sure for sure i think that's i mean that's an issue i think everybody deals with now there are very few like largescale projects where everything's built from scratch i mean like anybody using react for a project is trusting the devs behind react it's just um i don't know that's just the way web development is now uh for better or for worse we're all able to build really cool things and and build on you know what everyone else is working on it's really awesome it's great collaboration but at the same time yeah it does require that trust so i guess um it is a good idea to at least look at the package a bit look at the github repo uh see some of the issues what have people said about it how many people are actually using it um you know see basically if there's anything that just looks weird in terms of you know does nobody use this maybe there's a reason why nobody uses it um are there a ton of issues that that never get closed that's probably a warning sign too so at the end of the day though you're right you just you have to trust that the people that made the package uh did a good job and uh you know definitely make sure to test things out on your own um and not just trust that it's it's always gonna work uh okay let me let me start this and let's go oh okay i broke everything so let's check that out first and see why why it's broken now probably because i've messed up the width um shoot this just seems all right let me i think that maybe the float right is what's doing it see while i'm waiting for that to reload i'm just gonna go through okay all right that did work now um some of the functionality we needed i think because i think we have all the functionality now it it scrolls with a page but only when we want it to you click a link and it goes to the right section oh we're still missing that change in when we have that active class so that was something that was working before i started the stream so something that i've done since then has has changed it um so that plus this positioning is what we need to uh we need to fix all right let me i'm gonna save this i'm gonna try one more time just to see like what what's going on is this this is it always gonna happen and it looks like it is okay oh nice all right cool it um it worked this time all right excellent um at some point we may not get to it on this stream but we'll definitely want to make sure that that side navigation goes away we don't really have room for it on a smaller screen all right all right cool all right so now that's that's sorted and we need i need to figure out why the active class is not being applied here so let me inspect this so we can see if it's being applied let's see so it should be on i think it'll be applied here on the a tag okay yeah so it is being applied it's just the css that needs to change okay and that makes sense because the styles are actually on the li right now okay oops all right let's check it out it'd be nice if i could get the class to apply here but i don't think it's going to work like that nikki just said it looks like masonry is just being a bit slow on this machine yeah i think you're right um it's just this this machine just can't handle streaming very well hmm john said looks like this coding session has been conquered almost we're close we're really close okay so if i all right let me ask this is there a way in css to where i could change the style of a parent if the child has a certain class added i don't i don't know if that's even possible let's let's go to google i know you can do it on uh what is it like hover and stuff like that so hmm all right john's saying that styled components would work really well here because we could just switch the attribute name with javascript hmm uh actually let me let me uh to look at this from a different uh perspective here so i want to try two things one is nikki's idea and it's uh what if we move the link component outside the allies we'll try that first that seems to be the most straightforward thing if it works then great we're done if that doesn't work then what i want to do is let's move the styles onto the a tags and see if we can get a similar effect by putting the styles on the a tag whoa nikki there's a parent selector no way how did i not know about that oh wait a second is there really a parent selector or is that just a suggestion from css tricks all right i'm looking it up right now on can i use on the other screen all right i don't think that's it i think uh i found the um johnny says yes there's a parent selector all right let's try it then seems like it's not but a lot of people want it yeah i want it all right let's let's try moving this around this is gonna be really weird i don't think i don't know if this will work i'm just gonna try with one just to save time did it refresh it i don't think it did let me refresh okay john says the parent selector will be out in css4 all right so i guess i can't use it yet hmm oh you know what i didn't the css is still not not right so it it did work and you know that we now have an li inside of this a tag which actually that that's weird but it works um so we need to have li senior dev a active l i there we go okay that looks like it will work so really wish i didn't have to reload this again but i do it's just so slow i'll check my time while we're waiting all right about 10 minutes i think 10 minutes is more than enough to fix this problem hopefully all right i'm checking out the live chat while i'm waiting for that to load nikki says disclaimer i've never actually used position sticky uh just a possible answer for the problem you should do what you want good to know thanks for that because also the css tricks article on something uh is also a great resource i go to that when mdn starts to confuse me which is often okay that's that is good css tricks is um is pretty good all right cool check that out so we have when we're not on that area we don't have that little border and now when we scroll to it hey there's that little border perfect perfect all right nice really cool all right i like that um i'm thinking maybe the colors could be different uh we're not really using that yellow color in this site so we may want to change that um you may may or may not want to use the gold color for this you know maybe we'll go with you might want to go with uh regular color text with gold on the side um green text with gold on the side i mean there's a lot of combinations so i'm probably not going to get into that for this stream i mean it's pretty basic just changing hex colors on on text here um yeah all right very cool so what i do need to do though is to go back in and make sure i change the markup for that second link as well so that was i believe nikki's idea to put the li inside of the link tag and that was a great idea honestly i thought it would not work but it was such a straightforward change that it was definitely worth the try and it turned out that it did work for some reason my auto formatting is not correcting this mess that i just made um probably when i go to commit it'll get corrected so i'm not going to worry about it but i do want to wait for the refresh just to make sure it's working and i don't think it'll work to go down here because the page isn't long enough i can't actually scroll into the section so i won't be able to test that out but we see if we can see yeah it it won't work right now so if i add some like demo content to this section we can see if it'll work but i'm i'm pretty confident that it will i tested it out earlier with some different stuff and i was getting a change in the uh in the classes for each section and we can see like the the allies here so these look the same now all right let's save that and let's do a git status what why is my chrome bouncing what does it want to tell me i don't know um let's do uh commit now yeah this looks good okay cool um i think there's some low dash stuff we can get rid of like the four each i believe in the map values you know i want to i we can for sure get rid of the four each but i do want to double check about map values so maybe i'll um maybe i'll wait and double check that uh later on before i just get rid of it uh but for now we can do a git add and and we'll run through our yarn so we're going to add a feature and this we add um completed all right i added the word completed in there because i think i may have made a commit already that said we added this um when we had just added some of it and it didn't work yet so while that goes through all the tests and everything i'm going to go over to the live chat and start answering some questions so let me scroll up to where i left off uh devin says you should listen to everything everything spring summer winter dread while you work on this oh i have to all right i'll have to look that up i don't think i've heard that nikki said is it bigger than 16 pixels on windows i think that's let's talk about the scroll bar um devin says i.e scroll bar i thought we were dropping support yeah windows ie for sure has a big scroll bar but i think on windows in general every browser has a big scroll bar it's been a while since i've used windows so i'm i'm not 100 sure but i think the last time i tested on windows which is probably the last time we launched something new uh i i think there were large scroll bars even on on chrome devin says will this even be usable on ie can you just target ie and show a sub nav for spring summer at the top yeah we'll see i'm i'm not even going to try to make it 100 usable and ie uh i mean like think about this is like one page on an entire site that's gonna have thousands of pages most likely um i'm okay if one menu looks a little bit weird i'd actually it would be cool to see what it falls back to i mean i am interested in trying it on internet explorer just to see what happens there's got to be some like fallback position does it fall back to fixed in that case it'll still work it'll just look weird um when it's uh you know in the hero section devin says mixing top and margin right seems weird to me yeah it it definitely is weird uh it there's some weirdness going on with the styles and markup for this component so i think had i made it from scratch instead of importing a little bit from previous projects i maybe wouldn't have done it like that but um this works so i'm definitely i say i'm i'm pretty sure that there's probably a better way to do it um it probably wouldn't look different to the user and it probably wouldn't result i guess i tried to save that webpage all right that's why chrome was bouncing yeah so i i don't know that it would be worthwhile for me to really worry about about that at this point so i mean just to be clear i think writing good code and writing the best solutions is important but you don't always have time for that like i don't think i could make sure all this code is as close to perfect as possible and still get it launched on time uh so what we have to settle for then is does it work and is the code at least reasonable um you know and i that's that's my experience you know with actually working on projects with deadlines and things is that you just you just have to do it sometimes so but anyway i i entirely agree that setting the marge works but the reason we had to do that obviously was because of the float right so um we need that offset for the scroll spy uh so you can see that come into play like so we need that top value uh for the i'm sorry for the sticky so you can see that come into play of this 50 pixels down but then we also need the margin since we decided to use the float which is pretty weird to use with top as well that's why we needed that margin so definitely weird but it gets the job done and i think yeah it went through everything so i also fixed the test i remember yesterday i was saying that the tests were like taking forever so um i believe it was nikki that found the commit where i broke everything and so i was able to go back and um and change everything at some point i made a commit that reverted to an older version of the package json file i'm not exactly sure how that happened but it was about five days ago and so all this week this past week the tests have been acting weird that was why so now it's all worked out we have our test back and they run quickly so i'm going to run a get push to make sure that is on github so you all can check that out if you'd like a link to the github repo is in the description uh frankie s if i'm feeling better today oh thanks for asking frankie this morning i felt good but then after a couple hours my energy was just gone and um actually i was actually felt so good this morning i was thinking about working out i ended up not and just started work like right away uh i did have to take the kids to school so i got the kids ready and i took them to school and um i don't know i still might work out i'm thinking about it i just don't want to go i i don't feel 100 but i don't want to go too long without a workout because i know like with my depression if i go too long without working out i'll get depressed so even though my legs are still sore from my last workout that was two days ago it would be better for my mental health i think if i just do it so hopefully i'll do it and uh but i think this uh this antibiotic that i'm on is is starting to help the congestion is almost completely gone uh so i'm glad it i'm glad it seems like it's it's working because i honestly i've had this on and off i don't know what it is some type of virus or something i don't know on and off for it seems like months uh who knows how long it really was but it just seems like it's been so long um but hey i appreciate you asking thank you oh john says try out right 18 pixels all right i'll try that i'm not going to try it right now i want to test first i think it looks okay with 16 but i'm not opposed to bumping out a bit more if we need to especially for people using windows uh nikki says i also thought it wouldn't work so flipping the lis and the link tags um so that the allies inside the link so you're saying thought that wouldn't work what are the implications of not having the uli structure but a ul a structure a city truth i don't know but we may want to think about that i think visually there's not going to be any implications but for screen readers there might be i maybe i'll have to look at that i'm wondering yeah i mean based on the position and the markup that's actually a really good position i think for screen readers because it's like a sub menu that comes comes in there we'll have to see i mean maybe i might just have to try out just the basic screen reader that comes like on a mac and see what it says when it gets to that point i mean they'll still show up as link tags so user would know that it's it's a link i wonder how misleading anchor tags are for screen readers right because if they show up as a link would a screen reader just describe it as a link like to another page when it's really not it's just the link to a different spot in the same page like what happens when that jump happens does the screen reader also jump down i'm getting kind of off topic here but that's that's really interesting i just don't know you know what is doing that is jumping to a different section in the same page even a good idea for accessibility i don't know i need to learn more about that there's like a whole world of you know making your website more accessible that you know i just don't know enough about um john's pretty sure that li is not needed on uo uh also says chrome used to have an experimental flag to make a skinny scroll bar that shows wider when hovered not smart to develop with that flag on yeah why i mean i could see it would be easier to actually click a wider scroll bar to scroll up and down but i don't know i think that would be annoying for trying to develop stuff with that you're basically changing the width the window with on hover that's not i mean it's only a couple pixels that depending on where your break points are that could totally like make your whole layout reflow just on hover oh okay nikki said i i do have something in my package.json so i have a jest key that i need to remove but also says it's not a huge deal since it's not used now okay so i'll it's not hurting anything then to be there so i'll remove it at some point i guess uh yeah thanks for letting me know about that though that saved me so much time um you know earlier when you when you showed the commit where all that changed uh arthur says hey jesse i'm learning frontend development my problem is that i switch between html css and javascript as priorities i try to create a small javascript project but stop at designing but again uh i get sleepy while learning html css all that best practices and cool stuff um yeah i guess in terms of priorities it's i mean you you need to know you need to know all of it i mean i focus i depending on what you want to do i mean i would focus more on javascript you will pick up your html and css more along the way uh those to me seem to be more simple especially html there's some tricky things to css if you really want to get into it there are some people doing really complex things with css and really cool things but for most of us you know we don't need to be at that level uh for for a lot of the sites that we make so you're probably better off focusing on your javascript and then instead of getting like bogged down in the styles just use a framework like like bootstrap or materialize or if you're doing react you know you could use material ui or you know whatever other framework that way uh you won't get as distracted by the styles in the ui because so much of it is done for you and then maybe have you could maybe possibly set a rule for yourself that you get the site build all the functionality done first before you style um and then that way you know maybe you won't get you know stuck in in that section so i'm not i'm not 100 sure that that's your issue but uh sometimes that that helps me just not get too caught up in designing first because you could end up designing for elements and features that don't even make it into your site and then it ends up being you know a waste of time i mean you always learn from it but you know it did would take up a lot of your time that could otherwise be used to you know add more functionality to your um to your project or you know do more testing and things so um hopefully that that helps all right that's that's it for the um for the live chat and uh we basically accomplished what we set out to which is awesome so uh i i was a little bit bold and i wrote in the description to the video it was either in the description of the video or in my tweet about it i wrote that i will be completing uh this uh scroll spy nav today so when i wrote it i thought like uh what if i don't complete it i'm gonna i'm gonna feel silly but we did we completed it so that's pretty cool um okay arthur has some followup here uh i read a lot of articles watch courses and sometimes don't create a single project yeah i like design and want my projects to look good i struggle mostly with layouts and responses yeah yeah arthur definitely check out some of the frameworks that i mentioned because it'll take care a lot of the respon of the responsiveness i mean it's good to know how that works and writing media queries and things but it's a type of thing that you really only only want to do from scratch once and then either copy what you did for other projects or use a framework because it can be tedious and i think unnecessarily tedious i don't think there's a lot of value in recreating a whole layout system every single time unless you're doing something really experimental um then it's better off just to use something premade in in that case uh something thoroughly tested you know um yeah and make sure really try to do projects i mean it i get into the same thing sometimes where i read a lot of stuff i watch courses and things like that but um uh try to make sure that you're also working on projects maybe split up your time to say like okay i'm gonna spend this much time each day working on a project even if it don't get anywhere like i'm i'm gonna give it a good try and then you can go to your your other resources because it's important to actually be the building as well all right arthur says thanks for answering you're welcome arthas i have that bad feeling do it from zero yeah don't worry nobody does it from zero don't worry about that i used to feel the same way um especially when i was learning like i gotta do it all from scratch but nobody does it from scratch like we were talking about earlier in the stream like if you're building a react project how much work has already been done by the react team at facebook like so much work there's no such thing as from scratch for a react developer um you know there's so in so many things it's not just react if you're using angular if you're using vue uh if you're using any type of testing you know framework uh you know whatever even if you're just using um some boilerplate html code like unless you wrote it yourself and are copying it from a former project like still so i mean we all we all build on uh what others have done and that's i think a good thing uh so so don't worry too much about that as long as you can produce good work um you know i i'd say it's totally fine to rely on you rely uh you know somewhat on the work of others and um frankie says thanks sensei you're welcome i think it's so fun that you uh do you call me sensei um all right okay so i'm gonna end the stream now i've definitely put in um more than my normal amount of time working today and my kids are home from school um so i'm gonna see them and hopefully get a workout in i should be back tomorrow i will be in the office tomorrow we we have like some sort of drill for um in case there's some emergency on campus and it's in the afternoon so i'm going to try not to stream during the time when we're supposed to have the drill because i don't i don't want to have to leave my office in the middle of a stream so i'm thinking maybe in a stream early in the day so early in the day eastern time so just as a heads up to you all um yeah so anyway thanks all thanks everyone especially thanks for all your help uh definitely went faster you know because of all that help and i appreciate all the all the positivity uh that you all have not just today but all the time and until tomorrow have a wonderful day
