00:00 - In this video we are going to talk about
what is a MAC address. Let me remind you
00:04 - this has got nothing to do with the Big
Mac or the Mac operating system! Now,
00:08 - before we get into the details let me
give you an analogy: We have three people
00:12 - John, Bob, and Mary in a room who want to talk. Now, John, when he wants to talk to
00:17 - Mary, he says 'Hi, Mary! How are you doing?' Now, when Mary listens to this message,
00:22 - how does she know that she has to
respond to John? It's through his voice.
00:26 - So, she replies to John, but not Bob,
saying 'Hey, John! I'm doing good.' Now, if you
00:33 - have three different computers who want
to talk to each other they don't have
00:37 - any names, so to bring the analogy of
names and identification to computers we
00:43 - have this concept of MAC address, which
is unique to each computer's network
00:49 - interface card.
