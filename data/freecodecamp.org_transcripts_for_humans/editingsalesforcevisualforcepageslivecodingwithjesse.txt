00:05 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:08 - Jesse today we're going to do something
00:10 - that we've never done before on the
00:12 - stream we're going to work with
00:13 - Salesforce in particular we're going to
00:16 - edit some visualforce pages so I'm going
00:19 - to start out with a little introduction
00:21 - of Salesforce since we've never used it
00:22 - before you may not be familiar with it
00:26 - so sales forces as a product is huge and
00:32 - does a lot of different things so I'm
00:34 - only going to talk about the little
00:36 - piece that we're going to work with
00:38 - because I'm definitely not a an expert
00:42 - on Salesforce it would take quite a lot
00:45 - of research and training to learn it you
00:50 - know everything that it can do so I've
00:52 - learned enough to be able to do what
00:54 - we're gonna do today and even if you
00:57 - have no idea about Salesforce or what it
01:00 - does as long as you know basic HTML and
01:03 - CSS you'll be able to follow this string
01:06 - cuz that's really what we're going to
01:07 - deal with maybe we use some JavaScript
01:10 - we'll see I don't think we'll need to
01:14 - but you never know so Salesforce
01:22 - basically it's it's mostly used by
01:26 - companies who want to track like leads
01:29 - customers right so a marketing tool we
01:36 - at the university that work at use it a
01:39 - little bit differently in that the
01:42 - university you don't have customers in
01:45 - the same sense that maybe another
01:46 - company would have you know like a
01:48 - retail store or something so we have a
01:51 - prospective students right so students
01:54 - usually high school students who are
01:56 - interested in coming to to our schools
02:00 - so there are various ways that they
02:03 - reach out to us so we have an inquiry
02:06 - form for those students who are just you
02:08 - know kind of interested but then we also
02:11 - have an online
02:12 - an application that's what we're gonna
02:14 - be working on today and so what happens
02:16 - is when we have a student who's
02:17 - interested in coming here they get into
02:19 - the Salesforce system and then they're
02:22 - put into categories and there's data
02:24 - available for our admissions counselors
02:28 - it gets them into let's say like what
02:31 - you'd normally call a sales funnel
02:32 - although we don't really consider its
02:34 - sales and as they progress through the
02:37 - stages and then different things might
02:39 - happen they might get different
02:41 - materials so let's see it looks like
02:45 - there's audio popping all right let me
02:48 - try to move my chords around and get
02:51 - them away from my mic all right let me
02:57 - know if you're still getting the pocket
03:05 - that's odd some days I think it has to
03:08 - do with where I'm putting my phone and
03:10 - where the my phones usually plugged into
03:12 - my computer it usually has to do with
03:16 - where it is some days it's fine and
03:20 - other days it's two-hour anyway it's
03:23 - Fitz fix that's cool but anyway we're
03:29 - going to deal with that part of the
03:31 - process where a student has decided that
03:33 - they're interested enough in our
03:35 - university that they actually want to
03:36 - fill out an application to go here so we
03:40 - need to work on this application right
03:42 - now we're using an application that does
03:46 - funnel data into Salesforce eventually I
03:49 - did a lot of work on the current
03:52 - application to get it looking as nice as
03:57 - I possibly could but there were a lot of
03:59 - limitations so I have no direct access
04:02 - so I guess I could it would be better if
04:05 - I showed you the current application
04:06 - instead of just talking about it so the
04:15 - URL is not easy to remember so I'm going
04:18 - to go in through this way supply okay
04:23 - so the application to look at it is not
04:26 - terrible it actually shares a lot of the
04:28 - styles that you've seen that we've
04:30 - worked on in other other applications so
04:35 - the header should look familiar the
04:38 - white you know the three pixel gold
04:41 - border the shadows even the shadows on
04:44 - the card so everything is is the same
04:46 - even you know this material design style
04:50 - of the of the inputs so this was all
04:57 - done though with CSS that had to
05:03 - override what was already in there so
05:05 - all the only access I have to this is I
05:08 - was able to have the company that made
05:11 - this put in a link to a CSS file on a
05:18 - server that I do
05:20 - the popping is back you know what I'm
05:24 - just gonna unplug my phone completely
05:27 - and put it somewhere else let's put my
05:32 - foot over here all right
05:36 - so my phone I just now threw it in a
05:39 - chair on the other side of the room so
05:40 - if the popping is still there we'll know
05:44 - it's not my phone at least if if the
05:47 - popping is still there after that then
05:49 - I'll switch up to the the built-in mic
05:53 - on the iMac I think we try to fix this
05:57 - on another stream and I figure okay it's
06:00 - good now all right if it comes back
06:02 - please let me know I'll just quit using
06:03 - this mic let's see where was that I got
06:10 - I got off-track oh okay we're looking at
06:14 - this so basically the problem is I only
06:17 - can just do CSS work to it so I was
06:21 - limited in what I really could do like
06:23 - you know these inputs there there are
06:28 - little things that I couldn't make it
06:30 - exactly like the other the other forms
06:33 - okay and then on the back end of things
06:35 - there are some other some other problems
06:37 - and I'm not going to go through this
06:39 - form now but basically you need a
06:41 - there's a page refresh that happens
06:43 - every time you go to a different page so
06:47 - it's not a modern experience like you
06:49 - would get in a progressive web app or a
06:52 - single page application where you know
06:54 - you'd be able to navigate around without
06:59 - having the page refresh happen all the
07:01 - time so you you understand what I'm
07:03 - saying I mean the technologies are I
07:06 - don't know how you can see that or not
07:09 - but I mean it's it's jQuery base so the
07:13 - new application we can see we're getting
07:17 - a little bit better here still using
07:21 - some jQuery stuff which is
07:22 - understandable everybody uses jQuery but
07:25 - at least we're using a more modern
07:27 - responsive framework so they're actually
07:28 - using bootstrap for this okay so not bad
07:35 - so what we need to do then is change
07:39 - these default styles to match up more in
07:44 - line something like this it's not gonna
07:46 - look exactly the same but we need to use
07:49 - those same styles we've been using on
07:51 - all our projects it's going to be a
07:54 - little bit different though because
07:55 - we're not gonna have our normal dev
07:57 - environment set up we're gonna have like
08:03 - I just looked check the live chat and
08:06 - are sure that's what extension that is
08:08 - it's wet lap eliezer w APPA al y zer so
08:18 - I'll type that into the live chat so
08:25 - anyway that extension is pretty
08:26 - convenient to be able to just see what's
08:29 - with you don't really have to look at
08:30 - the code just with a click you can see
08:32 - what a website is built with so I'm
08:35 - always curious to see how people do
08:37 - things so this lets me just take a look
08:40 - quickly okay so that's basically you
08:46 - know what we're gonna do we're just
08:47 - going to try to get as much done as
08:48 - possible I don't expect to be able to
08:50 - get everything styled you know properly
08:54 - in here but for today it would be nice
08:58 - if we could get the header looking like
09:01 - the standard header that we've had the
09:04 - white header with the web logo on our
09:07 - gold border at the bottom and the
09:10 - correct shadow also we need to figure
09:14 - out what we're gonna do with this area
09:15 - here I'm not sure how I feel about this
09:22 - yet so maybe you can try a couple
09:23 - different things out I'll tell you what
09:25 - I'm thinkin so y'all can think about it
09:27 - though III see basically two options
09:30 - here I I don't like just this little
09:33 - strip of a of an image to be honest with
09:40 - you this page right here is just to sign
09:43 - up actually this is
09:44 - is me go to the first page login
09:54 - I think the first page is the login page
09:56 - ok this is the first page users will see
09:59 - the whole point is login so why do we
10:02 - have this big image and title here and
10:04 - push the login down far go to the bottom
10:06 - right the user needs to login they're
10:09 - not here to look at images so I'm
10:12 - thinking either completely get rid of
10:14 - the image and just have a very very
10:15 - simple login screen that it's obvious
10:18 - right away login here there's nothing
10:21 - else you can do just login or make some
10:24 - type of full screen background image
10:28 - with the login floating on top of it
10:32 - that way at least the login will stand
10:35 - out more and we'll have the image and
10:38 - the image will obviously be the not the
10:42 - focus it will be in the background and
10:44 - the focus of everything will be the sign
10:46 - and so either way my goal is to have the
10:48 - sign-in card be the focus so y'all can
10:53 - let me know what you think when we get
10:55 - to that point first things first let's
10:57 - get this header in better shape so let
11:00 - me pull over where do I have it
11:07 - yea let me pull over this Salesforce
11:09 - page
11:19 - and also let me know what the quality of
11:22 - the video is so YouTube changed how you
11:27 - do live streaming and you used to have
11:29 - the option to set beforehand what
11:31 - quality you wanted the video to be but
11:35 - now they took it away and I guess they
11:36 - automatically detect it I want to make
11:38 - sure that we're still able to get 1080p
11:41 - video so I'm trying to check the
11:44 - analytics it looks like some of you are
11:46 - watching in 1080p so I assume since
11:51 - that's happening then from my end it's
11:53 - it's alright I'm over five five thousand
11:57 - kilobits per second so I'm it should be
12:00 - good enough for at 1080p okay so this is
12:09 - what we'll be working with as our file
12:13 - so within Salesforce so if this is the
12:18 - old-school view of Salesforce so they do
12:21 - have an updated UI my organization is
12:25 - not switched over to the updated UI yet
12:27 - I can do a preview of it if I really
12:30 - want to but by default I still see the
12:33 - old views so if you are using Salesforce
12:36 - if you're a version of Salesforce may
12:38 - look different the how I got to here so
12:44 - probably may not be a big deal if you
12:46 - don't use Salesforce but in case you do
12:48 - I'll just quickly go over how I got here
12:51 - so up in the upper right hand corner for
12:53 - me there is a setup if you're using the
12:57 - newer version there'll be a little
13:00 - Settings icon you know like the little
13:02 - looks like a gear within the settings
13:05 - icon then you can click setup either way
13:07 - once you get to setup you go over here
13:09 - it's gonna look different depending on
13:11 - the version but they'll still be this
13:12 - this sidebar here and you want to go to
13:15 - develop and then expand that and go to
13:18 - visualforce pages then you're going to
13:20 - be given a huge list of available pages
13:23 - figure out what page you want click it
13:26 - and then you're in here the first screen
13:29 - you get won't be this it'll it'll show
13:31 - some info
13:32 - but it's not editable if you have the
13:34 - proper level of permissions in
13:39 - Salesforce there'll be an edit button
13:41 - click Edit and that's how you get into
13:42 - here so I know that was really fast
13:45 - I just don't spend that much time on it
13:47 - if anybody wants to talk about it more
13:49 - later on let me know during the question
13:50 - and answer session let's see I'm trying
13:56 - to find my my timer so don't forget here
13:59 - we go and I will bring it up here
14:05 - ok so let's set that 25 minute timer and
14:07 - get to work
14:11 - ok so I need to figure out a way to make
14:20 - this look a little nicer actually let me
14:27 - pull this out let's pull all this code
14:29 - out and put it in a code editor it'll be
14:31 - a lot easier to see it in a proper
14:35 - editor so I'm just gonna pull this into
14:38 - this page and let's set since this is
14:42 - HTML hopefully it'll it'll deal with
14:45 - these custom tags
14:46 - yeah that's not about it it looks like
14:48 - it's dealt properly with some of these
14:49 - custom tags so basically Salesforce has
14:53 - their own I guess maybe like a
14:56 - templating system it's this apex so a PE
14:59 - X right so they have these apex tags so
15:04 - think of this as I don't know if I want
15:11 - to call them exactly components like in
15:13 - the react if you have components but I
15:18 - it's somewhat like that
15:20 - alright so it operates something like
15:22 - that we could see that it allows us to
15:25 - insert you know variables dynamic
15:29 - content into the HTML so I guess in a
15:33 - sense it does it's you could think of in
15:36 - a similar way teraz react lets you mix
15:39 - javascript in the HTML I know it's
15:41 - really not that it's it's more you put
15:44 - HTML and a JavaScript function
15:46 - but this is a similar thing that we get
15:48 - to put programming concepts right in
15:52 - this case variables into into HTML we're
15:58 - not really going to be messing with that
15:59 - that much though I don't want to mess
16:01 - with what this does by default what I do
16:03 - want to change is the container the HTML
16:06 - shell that's around this so let's see I
16:14 - just remembered I didn't really check
16:16 - the live chat yet so hey everybody just
16:21 - want to see what's going on quickly
16:25 - before I start okay
16:36 - so let's just briefly go through some of
16:40 - this you can see this looks aside from
16:42 - all these apex tags it's a basic HTML
16:45 - page right you have your HTML at your
16:47 - head title tag you know all your links
16:51 - that are bringing in write your icons
16:53 - your JavaScript CSS C we're bringing in
16:58 - bootstrap here they do have some custom
17:01 - CSS where I have been unable to locate
17:04 - in Salesforce where this file is this
17:08 - target X dot CSS I would love to be able
17:12 - to just edit this file directly but I
17:15 - can't find it and I've already spent too
17:16 - much time looking for it so I've just
17:18 - given up on that and we're just gonna
17:20 - add our own CSS and we may end up
17:24 - putting it in a style tag or we could
17:28 - link to it from something else we'll see
17:32 - I can see pros and cons to either way
17:38 - alright so now we get to the body I just
17:41 - put in this class body test just to make
17:44 - sure I had there were a few templates
17:45 - that were all named very similar names
17:48 - so I needed to make sure which one was
17:49 - actually the active template so that's
17:51 - why I've added this in so I'm gonna
17:53 - remove this now since it served its
17:58 - purpose whoops I went to save it well
18:03 - what I'll do is maybe we can make
18:05 - changes here with art so we could use
18:07 - our editor and then at periodically
18:10 - we'll just copy and paste everything
18:11 - into here so I realize changes I make
18:15 - here are gonna do anything yet but I
18:18 - think that'll allow us to take advantage
18:21 - of some of what we the features we have
18:24 - in our code editor it'll probably be
18:27 - easier in the long run to do it like
18:29 - that ok so we have our nav component and
18:35 - and remember - if you used to bootstrap
18:37 - try to think in in bootstrap mode in
18:41 - terms of when you see some of these
18:43 - classes they may be familiar to you now
18:46 - this page is actually really basic and
18:48 - that mo
18:49 - of the markup is going to be injected
18:52 - you know with with these apex tags so
18:57 - we're not gonna be able to see
18:58 - everything we may have to do some
18:59 - digging if we really want to change
19:01 - something but I think we'll be able to
19:05 - get a lot done with the combination of
19:07 - this template and chrome dev tools and
19:11 - we may not even have to dig in and find
19:15 - these files this actually feels very
19:18 - similar to what we are doing with that
19:19 - dotnet framework main website page that
19:23 - we were working on a few weeks ago okay
19:26 - so alright so we have some things
19:30 - comment it out okay so this file
19:40 - actually you can see is very very simple
19:42 - like I said really at this point all
19:45 - we're gonna be doing with it is using it
19:48 - to add in some of our styles so let's
19:55 - get to work on picking out some of the
19:57 - things that we want to change so we're
19:59 - gonna go in with dev tools I am for this
20:02 - particular window I'm using Chrome
20:05 - Canary if you're not familiar with
20:07 - Chrome Canary it's the latest version of
20:09 - Chrome I don't know that it's
20:11 - necessarily like the cutting-edge
20:13 - version they might there might be a
20:15 - better version but it's pretty stable
20:17 - and it allowed the reason I like to use
20:19 - this sometimes is that it gives you
20:21 - access to new features and dev tools
20:24 - before they are released into regular
20:27 - chrome when I'm testing a site I like to
20:30 - use the regular version of Chrome
20:32 - because the odds of a user actually
20:35 - using Chrome Canary are super low so
20:38 - anyway so my dev tools may look a little
20:43 - bit different than yours and actually
20:46 - let me let me copy and paste this into
20:49 - the live chat the link I didn't test to
20:52 - see if this was available to everyone
20:54 - but I assume it is I guess I could let's
20:58 - see
21:03 - alright yeah that should be available to
21:05 - everyone
21:06 - actually let's update our Chrome Canary
21:10 - write it canary has updates so
21:14 - frequently which is ok you can see it
21:17 - only took a second to update ok now
21:22 - let's go into our dev tools and let me
21:30 - try to get this so I'm not worried about
21:34 - these errors because I really can't do
21:38 - much about them anyway like I said there
21:42 - are some files that I have not been able
21:44 - to find so I can't fix that so let's
21:46 - save some space and just minimize that
21:49 - and let me know is this font size too
21:55 - small in dev tools I can probably expand
21:59 - it a bit and make it a little bigger I'm
22:04 - afraid if I get too big we just won't be
22:07 - able to see things all right so let's
22:10 - try to target this a nav bar and I've
22:14 - already the only thing I've done is I've
22:16 - pulled in the low the proper logo and
22:21 - I'm actually I'm maybe going to find a
22:23 - better solution than this but right now
22:24 - I'm just linking directly to the logo
22:26 - that's on that Resource Center that we
22:30 - that we built maybe a month or so ago ok
22:36 - so we're gonna have that's interesting
22:38 - so it looks like we're gonna go the nav
22:44 - component itself
22:46 - yeah the napkin phone is what we want
22:50 - yeah ok
22:51 - so here in the nav component let's
22:54 - change some what we're doing we don't
22:58 - want a border at all so I don't think
23:08 - yeah first let's let's do some things to
23:10 - cancel out some of the styles that are
23:12 - in there you can see these are coming
23:13 - from bootstrap I have no desire to edit
23:15 - bootstrap directly I think that's a
23:17 - mistake
23:18 - so let's just work with what we have so
23:21 - we're gonna go border:none so we have no
23:26 - border there but then now we want to do
23:30 - a border bottom and we're gonna go with
23:36 - three pixels solid and we need to grab
23:40 - that gold color and I always forget what
23:42 - it is so where is it this is the fastest
23:46 - way for me to get this gold color
23:51 - probably in this project that's fine CSS
23:57 - we don't anything in our CSS
24:06 - let's see if I can find where we use
24:09 - this
24:20 - then we put in our app bar
24:26 - nope do not put it in here
24:40 - I do not remember where we put all of
24:43 - the styles
24:52 - a few guys theme that's gotta be it we
24:56 - didn't even put it in there alright
24:58 - enough of that that's a waste waste of
25:00 - time let's go here and just inspect this
25:03 - one
25:14 - very an h1 really that whole things in H
25:18 - tag you see what kind of ridiculous
25:20 - stuff happens sometimes when you don't
25:22 - have control over the markup my entire
25:25 - at bar at the top is an h1 tag it's
25:31 - insane
25:32 - it's an h1 to anyway
25:36 - that stuff just it just amazes me
25:40 - sometimes but this is actually this is
25:42 - what I had to do to make an AB bar the
25:44 - only element that would work for this
25:48 - was an h1 so anyway uh-huh that's just
25:55 - that's just the way it is sometimes you
25:57 - gotta work with what you have okay
26:01 - bringing back all these memories of when
26:03 - I actually did that work and how
26:05 - frustrating it was it's it's a mix of
26:08 - fun and frustration it's fun because
26:10 - it's like I can't believe I just took
26:12 - this crazy markup and it made something
26:15 - that looked decent with it and then
26:17 - frustration because it's like all I need
26:19 - is a div right here and you can't do
26:23 - anything you can't put the div in okay
26:26 - cool so we have our border at the bottom
26:28 - now we need our shadows so let's grab
26:40 - we could check the shadows here yeah I
26:44 - guess we'll just use these shadows I do
26:46 - want to make sure that they match
26:49 - actually these do look like the newer
26:51 - shadows initially we use slightly
26:54 - different values and I'm talking like
26:57 - maybe a year ago or something we had
26:59 - slightly different shadow values and
27:01 - then materialized CSS updated and added
27:06 - a third line here in their box shadow
27:11 - and so I don't I don't remember what we
27:15 - updated what we didn't so anyway that
27:17 - does look good that looks like the right
27:18 - values so let's use those so we're gonna
27:28 - throw in this whoa it's not let me paste
27:31 - that in that's let's try again
27:37 - we're just gonna grab the values this
27:40 - son and we'll type box shadow on our own
27:43 - sometimes paste thing into dev tools can
27:46 - be a little weird if you paste if you
27:49 - accidentally paste the wrong stuff it
27:50 - just rejects it yes it worked that time
27:56 - awesome whoa maybe it didn't what did I
28:00 - do
28:00 - oh I type accidentally Ted bucks sizing
28:08 - box shadow that's what we want okay
28:11 - great and that should work let's check
28:14 - back here we can't really see it but
28:17 - there should be a shadow you can
28:19 - slightly see the shadow so all right
28:23 - cool so we have that down the basics
28:26 - down there it's not what I wanted so
28:29 - let's grab these and pull them over huh
28:36 - I'm actually not sure what the best way
28:39 - to to do these styles is you know what
28:43 - let's um
28:47 - for now let's just open up another
28:56 - another file here and whoops let's let's
29:03 - just start putting styles in a file and
29:05 - then that way we don't have to make a
29:06 - decision on where to put the styles and
29:08 - yet never yeah let's just use nav bar
29:17 - dot nav are there we go okay
29:25 - actually let me save this in case
29:28 - something happens and I guess I should
29:35 - say this is a project so let's make a
29:38 - new folder and call this so forth yeah
29:47 - I'll just call it Salesforce and let's
29:51 - go application dot CSS okay cool
30:00 - so now we can
30:07 - let's try to make this logo look like it
30:10 - should look so we need every nerve
30:15 - container assuming it's in here
30:28 - there we go so target X header
30:31 - University icon wow that that is quite a
30:35 - quite a large class so I'm just gonna
30:38 - paste that class in here right now
30:40 - so now we're gonna be using that and
30:42 - let's see it's just it's simply a
30:45 - background image so you can see the
30:47 - background image it goes back to this
30:49 - default so we're gonna take that
30:53 - background image and we're definitely
30:56 - going to keep that at least for now
30:59 - we're gonna keep that that URL so we'll
31:05 - have that in our file now what we want
31:07 - to do is add in some some options here
31:14 - see you check my timer
31:18 - alright good eleven minutes
31:27 - let's see so wow it's been a while since
31:34 - I just did straight-up CSS its
31:36 - background
31:37 - [Music]
31:42 - let's go background repeat' cuz we
31:45 - definitely don't want to repeat no
31:47 - repeat
31:49 - and then background is it sighs there's
31:53 - so many background properties there we
31:56 - go that's what I wanted sighs cover
31:57 - contain container I don't want
32:01 - I guess contain is what we want for now
32:06 - and then okay we need to set it with
32:12 - let's go with actually
32:21 - there we go that looks good let's check
32:26 - that out for a minute okay what's that
32:29 - sighs look actually I like that sighs
32:32 - that's not too bad let me see what it
32:34 - looks like here nice
32:37 - all right that's actually it was a
32:42 - breakpoint I think we'll be fine even
32:47 - great all right I really like that I
32:50 - think that's perfect so let's let's copy
32:53 - this over and paste it I do want to see
32:55 - if we even need this no repeat that's
32:57 - yep we definitely need that I was hoping
33:00 - we we didn't need it when we put the
33:01 - contain on but we will so always worth
33:05 - it to try to save a line of code though
33:13 - there we go okay awesome all right so it
33:18 - looks like our header is looking a lot
33:21 - closer to what we our standard header is
33:23 - now we definitely want to change I don't
33:26 - mind this this online application I
33:28 - actually really like this font off to
33:31 - double check and see what font this is
33:33 - I'm just I'm interested in seeing what
33:36 - they have loaded already let's see the
33:40 - font family hi it's just open sans that
33:47 - looks really nice being being thin like
33:50 - that obviously we're going to import
33:53 - Roboto that's the font that we use for
33:56 - everything I'm not going to do it right
33:59 - now though we'll see how things go so I
34:04 - think with let's change this to that
34:06 - green color the font color to green and
34:08 - then we'll change these icons to green I
34:11 - hope I just got to do this I really
34:16 - really hope these are font icons or
34:17 - SVG's if not we're gonna totally replace
34:20 - these icons actually we might replace
34:22 - these icons no matter what
34:32 - before we're using
34:48 - an interesting
34:57 - huh really interesting okay
35:02 - so here's what I'd like to do I'm a just
35:05 - now I think about it I may actually just
35:07 - remove the icons I don't think we need
35:10 - any icons there sign up and log in or
35:12 - find the thing here's the one thing I
35:14 - did not like about those icons okay
35:17 - obviously those weren't material design
35:18 - so icons but aside from that it seemed
35:23 - to me like that icon was supposed to be
35:27 - a male a silhouette of a male head okay
35:31 - so I would rather use an icon for a
35:36 - person that would be gender-neutral
35:39 - that's just a personal preference for me
35:42 - and I think I think users would
35:46 - appreciate that even if it's just they
35:48 - don't realize it I I prefer to do it
35:52 - like that so in this case I actually
35:56 - like it better without the icons I think
35:58 - the icon and the text was unnecessary
36:01 - so let's while we're down here let's
36:06 - grab all this and we're gonna reset the
36:12 - content
36:15 - let me grab all this
36:25 - and calendar before email before you had
36:31 - our user all right let's get rid of this
36:36 - because I don't want to mess with those
36:38 - yet what I do want to worry about is
36:43 - this header user before now I'm assuming
36:46 - that that's what this is content and
36:49 - then we're just gonna give it that let's
36:54 - double check target X header user yep
36:57 - that is what we wanted okay great so now
37:01 - that's gonna remove that for us while
37:03 - we're down here let's um let's see where
37:07 - we're getting the font color from target
37:12 - X header you so it is in fact on that
37:14 - target X header user okay so we're gonna
37:16 - have to grab this header print counter
37:20 - you know you know what let's grab all
37:22 - this and change the color of it
37:34 - ok this will be that green color so
37:39 - actually I used to have the highlight
37:42 - that worked an atom that showed the
37:43 - color but it was throwing all kind of
37:46 - errors it's the pigments is the the
37:48 - package and it's thrown all kind of
37:51 - errors so I turned it off so you can't
37:54 - see the color that was always nice but
37:55 - not necessary ok great so that should be
38:00 - fine for the font color let's let's just
38:02 - change it here just so that we can get a
38:07 - nice visual okay there we go and
38:20 - all right let's see what we have here
38:26 - where we're getting that color from
38:28 - Target etc university name great let's
38:34 - just add this here we can manually add
38:43 - it in here just so we can see it great
38:48 - okay now I'm gonna change the font the
38:51 - font way the size probably at some point
38:55 - for now this is okay I just want to see
38:57 - what the colors look like and I want to
39:01 - see what the color looks like for this
39:03 - online application but I think the gray
39:07 - might it might work out it might look
39:08 - nice with the gray so we're gonna try it
39:10 - but maybe we'll switch it back so let's
39:13 - see actually let me do this
39:22 - I'm gonna add in an another attribute
39:26 - and that way we can switch back and
39:28 - forth 52 colors more easily okay so
39:34 - here's the green let's zoom out because
39:36 - a user will almost never be zoomed in
39:38 - that much and we're going to toggle back
39:40 - and forth
39:52 - hmm interesting I'm not I'm not sure
39:55 - that I have a preference by their way so
40:00 - here's what I'm going to do let's put
40:04 - this in here and
40:25 - we'll just make a little note so that
40:28 - later on we can make a decision on that
40:31 - okay my timer is up so I'm going to do
40:34 - five minutes of question-and-answer in
40:37 - the live chat and then we'll do another
40:38 - 25-minute session of just some CSS this
40:43 - is actually pretty fun for me I I mean I
40:45 - started out doing a lot of CSS just like
40:49 - this people would come to me with
40:51 - existing sites that needed work done and
40:53 - I would go in there and just try to make
40:54 - the best of it so this is very like
40:57 - natural and fun for me so I'm having a
41:05 - good time hopefully you are enjoying it
41:08 - as well I read an article yesterday I
41:11 - forget where it was from but the article
41:14 - was someone recalling a conversation
41:18 - they had with a person who was
41:23 - attempting to hire developers that could
41:25 - work with just regular HTML and CSS they
41:29 - said they were having trouble finding
41:30 - people like that they could find people
41:32 - that knew how to use frameworks they
41:33 - could use angular react view and do
41:37 - really well but anytime they asked him
41:39 - to do just a simple basic CSS change or
41:42 - vanilla JavaScript change they couldn't
41:44 - do it and I that was really interesting
41:47 - to me because I haven't had that
41:50 - experience I came up through doing just
41:53 - normal CSS and JavaScript before I
41:56 - started with react and different
41:57 - frameworks so but they were saying
41:59 - because of coding boot camps there are a
42:02 - lot of people a lot of developers now
42:04 - that are coming through the coding boot
42:06 - camps they focus on the frameworks like
42:09 - react or angular and you learn that and
42:11 - to save time because they need to get in
42:14 - so much material they skip over a lot of
42:17 - the basics you know why learn CSS if you
42:19 - could just use bootstrap right or some
42:22 - component library so anyway I thought
42:26 - that was interesting so maybe I'll try
42:27 - to occasionally throw in some basic CSS
42:30 - stuff like this because evidently
42:35 - there's some there's some need for it in
42:37 - some
42:38 - cases let's see
42:57 - okay I'm bear to saying the image looks
42:59 - very gloomy are you talking about this
43:02 - image in the background I think at that
43:05 - point in the stream we were talking
43:07 - about this image so potentially yeah
43:09 - actually this image is the default stock
43:11 - photo that came with this this
43:13 - application so we we hired a third-party
43:16 - company that's not Salesforce but they
43:18 - developed this for Salesforce and this
43:20 - is their default thing so I don't even
43:23 - know what school this is but we're
43:24 - definitely gonna if we keep an image we
43:26 - are going to take that out actually I
43:29 - just made up my mind we're not gonna
43:30 - have an image in it first if people
43:33 - higher up than me tell me I need to put
43:35 - an image back in I will but we're gonna
43:37 - save so much time by not having to go
43:40 - through images and pick what image we
43:41 - want for this and then edit the image
43:44 - okay so let's just let's just do that
43:47 - and then of course I would want to have
43:48 - responsive images so I would want
43:50 - multiple crops and sizes so that's we're
43:53 - gonna save a lot of time no no oh man
44:01 - almost locked me out okay
44:14 - oh cool so Michael Creole says my first
44:18 - time watching you live awesome thank you
44:21 - for joining us hopefully you're still
44:23 - joining us I know you sent that message
44:26 - a while ago about a half hour ago yeah
44:30 - but that's awesome I'm so glad that you
44:31 - could you could join us live and thanks
44:33 - for letting me know so feel free to send
44:37 - me any comments or questions that you
44:39 - have and I'd love to hear more from you
44:45 - Harshit says I guess Salesforce is the
44:48 - company who made Heroku oh really I did
44:51 - not remember that that's cool yeah
44:54 - Salesforce is a really big company they
44:56 - just either built or bought one of the
45:00 - biggest buildings in San Francisco for
45:02 - their headquarters so they're quite
45:05 - quite a successful company right now a
45:09 - harsh it says the editor looks like
45:11 - notepad plus plus yeah does it
45:13 - definitely looks like notepad plus plus
45:15 - I was not in a hurry to use that that
45:18 - built-in editor
45:28 - okay I see something about font size let
45:33 - me increase that font size again oh
45:34 - maybe we'll have to extend this a little
45:39 - bit all right
45:45 - maybe right there we'll be all right Oh
45:49 - Michael says here in the woods of
45:51 - Mississippi I'm struggling to get 360
45:54 - probably not your fault oh man I'm sorry
45:56 - that must be really hard to see
45:57 - everything I'll do my best to describe
45:59 - everything because I it's probably tough
46:02 - to see it on 360 we'll talk about video
46:05 - quality so anyway Michael uh awesome
46:11 - you're from Mississippi I don't recall
46:13 - anyone ever on the stream saying that
46:15 - they're from Mississippi so you might be
46:16 - the first person well harsh it's in the
46:24 - Himalayas I'm not sure if I had anybody
46:27 - say they're in the Himalayas before so
46:29 - that's that's cool
46:44 - all right so my timer is up I'm gonna
46:48 - grab a pen and write down where I'm
46:51 - going to leave off here in the live chat
46:52 - so I can find it more quickly later on
46:57 - and let's do another 25-minute coding
47:02 - session and the first thing that we're
47:05 - going to do first thing we're gonna do
47:13 - is we're gonna grab this code and that
47:20 - we just did so all this and we're gonna
47:23 - put it in and see if it works I
47:26 - definitely want to test it periodically
47:28 - because I'm not sure if this is enough
47:31 - to override the styles that are in there
47:33 - right now sometimes you never know what
47:36 - gets injected into the page in line that
47:40 - could be overriding thing so now's a
47:43 - great time since we've finished this one
47:45 - component here I think now's a great
47:47 - time to check that out we don't want to
47:50 - forget though there is this drop-down
47:53 - menu so oh great okay I was worried that
47:58 - it would it would mess up a lot when we
48:00 - changed our Styles you know what I think
48:05 - this is fine the only thing that I'm
48:07 - gonna change about this is I don't want
48:09 - I want this to not have a background and
48:12 - I want this icon to be green
48:15 - let's go ahead and change that now and
48:18 - then we'll check it we'll check out the
48:19 - code so icon bar okay so the for the
48:27 - icon bar or default never tell you icon
48:30 - bar all right let's change this to 2a
48:41 - oh goodness this is how they did it
48:51 - oops that's not what I wanted I'd wait a
48:54 - second hold on
49:02 - this is so interesting okay bordercolor
49:11 - all right let's get rid of that border
49:13 - so no border color none will that work
49:17 - no we're gonna have to go transparent
49:24 - okay so let's let's throw this in here
49:27 - now so we're gonna have several elements
49:30 - they're gonna have to edit so let's go
49:31 - with border-color:transparent for that
49:36 - navbar and then this is taller
49:41 - navigation that's for the screen reader
49:43 - so see this is s our only screen reader
49:46 - only and then it has text so that a
49:49 - screen reader when it gets to this we'll
49:51 - say it's the toggle navigation so that's
49:53 - useful for people who can't see or have
49:57 - trouble seeing and it's it's a good it's
50:02 - always good to think about that when
50:04 - you're developing so I think it's
50:06 - something that is really easy to forget
50:09 - but it's so important for people with
50:12 - disabilities to be able to have access
50:14 - to the site it may not seem like a big
50:19 - deal but to that person it's a huge deal
50:23 - all right so did that actually show up
50:28 - as green now it did yeah it was just a
50:31 - bit hard to see I want to double-check
50:37 - what we're using on our other sites in
50:40 - terms of border-radius for these so
50:43 - let's let's quickly go to
50:56 - let's go to the resource center and
50:59 - let's check this out it's not let me
51:06 - zoom why not now that's weird
51:17 - there we go my trackpad has been acting
51:21 - a bit weird okay so it looks like
51:22 - there's no border-radius on those so
51:24 - let's change that up I'm gonna leave
51:26 - this open so we can reference it more
51:28 - quickly whoops there we go okay so now
51:32 - back to here let's change our border
51:40 - radius to zero there we go now we have
51:46 - the look that we want great so let's
51:50 - take this just grab this and we're gonna
52:01 - grab this one so anyway if I sounded
52:09 - somewhat amazed when I first looked at
52:11 - this and that was because I realized
52:13 - that this is not a font icon or an SVG
52:16 - this is in fact three spans that just
52:20 - have a background color but yeah that's
52:23 - so interesting and actually you could do
52:26 - quite a lot with this since it's three
52:28 - spans I mean you could use some CSS
52:30 - animations to do some really cool
52:33 - animation things I've seen cool things
52:36 - done with these before so we're not
52:38 - going to do anything like that right now
52:39 - but it's just kind of cool to see it
52:41 - done like that I've seen it before but I
52:44 - never do it like this so it's just is
52:47 - kind of interesting to see how other
52:50 - people do that and okay I didn't copy
52:55 - that yet okay and we can remove these
52:59 - because we don't really want to change
53:00 - that all right now I think it's time to
53:06 - test this out so let's copy everything
53:08 - that we have here and let me let's paste
53:17 - it in so let's find a good spot here in
53:20 - the head to put in oops
53:25 - you know what I forgot that's not how
53:27 - our flow is going to go it's good too
53:30 - have a good workflow so things don't get
53:32 - messed up so I have a lot of experience
53:35 - with having to work with old systems or
53:37 - within these other systems and so you
53:39 - kind of have to just improvise a
53:41 - workflow since you can't have it ideally
53:43 - the way you want so here's the workflow
53:45 - what the workflow is going to be we're
53:48 - always going to edit this file first and
53:50 - then copy and paste everything over that
53:52 - way we can have a copy locally and
53:54 - actually I'm going to need let's just
53:56 - save this now in our projects under
53:59 - Salesforce so let's call this app
54:09 - template dot HTML great now let's create
54:18 - a style tag and then we can paste in all
54:25 - our Styles now we'll copy everything
54:31 - over and paste it all in this will it's
54:35 - it might seem kind of weird to do this
54:37 - now but if we start editing multiple
54:39 - places in here and going back in and
54:42 - trying to edit things it's going to get
54:44 - difficult it's much easier to just every
54:47 - single time we do something completely
54:49 - replace everything then trying to scroll
54:52 - through and find the exact spot where we
54:55 - need to edit things so in the long run
54:58 - the feedback loop is going to be much
55:00 - shorter if we just do it like this
55:02 - controls ctrl a ctrl c ctrl V is really
55:07 - fast to do I'm sorry I'm on a Mac its
55:09 - command so anyway so let's do save I
55:14 - recommend quick save if you're working
55:17 - in Salesforce save will take you back to
55:20 - the original page and then you have to
55:22 - hit edit again and go back in click save
55:24 - let you stay on this page so let's do a
55:28 - refresh and see how much of what we've
55:33 - done what we've done is actually gonna
55:36 - work okay not too bad it looks like our
55:41 - colors are good
55:44 - the border is good I I can see the
55:47 - shadow great obviously the logo the
55:51 - color here is I believe that's a green
55:56 - it is but we do have an issue with with
56:00 - this though showing up so that's one
56:02 - thing we'll have to override and let's
56:05 - check this out
56:06 - oops we have a hover I had never took
56:09 - away the hover effect so we want to get
56:12 - rid of that okay so let's let's do that
56:17 - so two things we need to do get rid of
56:20 - these guys and then get rid of that
56:22 - hover effect so let me do the hover
56:25 - first so I don't forget because the
56:27 - icons are a lot more obvious so let's
56:30 - inspect that and what we're gonna do so
56:38 - this is the the element that we're going
56:43 - to be working with we can go in here and
56:45 - dev tools and click on hover and then
56:48 - click the box for hover and so now we
56:51 - don't have to move our mouse over this
56:53 - it's going to be permanently hovered
56:54 - until we uncheck this and now we can see
56:57 - the hover styles so let's grab let's
57:02 - just let's grab all of this and but set
57:09 - transparent as the background color
57:11 - right normally we wouldn't be setting
57:17 - transparent as a background color that's
57:19 - ridiculous right but remember we're not
57:23 - going to directly edit this file so we
57:25 - have to think how can we override
57:27 - everything so actually let me see by
57:33 - default ever see where I want to put
57:36 - this thing
57:46 - I'm gonna put it here
57:51 - yeah that makes sense we're going to
57:57 - have to give a little bit of thought to
57:59 - our net organization of our code and
58:02 - actually I messed up on my um on my
58:09 - workflow here it should have gone here
58:13 - first
58:20 - I guess it doesn't matter we could do it
58:22 - either way it might save us a step if we
58:25 - just did it all here but I wouldn't kind
58:28 - of like to have a separate copy okay so
58:39 - you have that here say that there and so
58:44 - that should be taken care of and then
58:47 - finally let's go in here and inspect
58:51 - this and make sure it should be this
58:54 - before you know what maybe we edited the
58:58 - wrong thing
59:05 - let's take a look at this again
59:16 - hmm
59:25 - that's interesting
59:37 - oops I think we we went to the wrong
59:40 - before so well yeah we just need to edit
59:45 - our CSS so let's go ahead and do that
59:48 - I'm not even gonna test it in dev tools
59:50 - because I target header user okay
59:58 - because I am 99% sure that this will
60:02 - work just like this we'll just amend
60:11 - this here all right now let's let's give
60:16 - it another test before we move on quick
60:20 - save this kind of thing really makes you
60:25 - appreciate live reloading great okay so
60:32 - that works now No
60:40 - okay we've done something wrong here
60:43 - let's double check what we had here in
60:46 - our code whoops this is the problem
61:00 - his parents
61:21 - okay great now that that does work
61:23 - awesome
61:34 - you know what I think we have a hover
61:35 - effect right here on this text I can
61:39 - barely see it
61:43 - good let's see probably on this span
61:47 - let's check out the hover on the span no
61:53 - let's check out the hover here yep there
61:56 - we go okay so on this this a tag we have
62:00 - a hover effect where the color changes
62:07 - yeah I mean that's not a huge deal you
62:10 - can barely tell but I'll I'll see it so
62:15 - let me change that okay this will be an
62:18 - easy change just without we're going to
62:20 - do that we're just going to go a to a
62:24 - target etc user
62:33 - we're going to add this on here
62:46 - area and that should work
62:58 - okay I'm not even gonna test that that's
63:03 - that's definitely gonna work okay
63:06 - awesome so we've got a totally
63:11 - redesigned header I don't want to say
63:15 - totally I mean it we didn't do that much
63:18 - here right and we just remove some
63:21 - things but now this already just because
63:26 - we did the header I think this already
63:27 - looks like a Franciscan University
63:29 - website according to the the updated
63:32 - styles that we've been using so awesome
63:38 - awesome that looks a million times
63:40 - better than then would it look like an
63:42 - hour ago
63:46 - sorry that sounded like I was I was
63:52 - bragging on there I'm just I'm not I
63:55 - didn't mean for it to come out like that
63:57 - I'm just happy that this all worked out
64:01 - and it I'm happy with the way it looks
64:03 - right now all right so let me check out
64:06 - the time eight minutes okay let's see
64:23 - just see what we'll do nice let's just
64:25 - take this image out of here
64:30 - you know what I'm gonna see if I can
64:32 - find the actual element where this image
64:35 - is because here's what I don't want to
64:37 - happen
64:37 - I don't want us we could test this out
64:42 - for sure but what I'm afraid might
64:44 - happen is that this image would somehow
64:47 - get loaded anyway if we just try to
64:51 - override it so let's see what what this
64:59 - image is yeah it's probably it's a
65:02 - background image so yeah I don't want it
65:06 - to accidentally get loaded
65:09 - next - word hero so if we can find this
65:15 - let's just try to remove it target X
65:17 - dashboard here oh I have a feeling that
65:19 - we're not gonna find it in the file but
65:21 - it's worth a shot so let's go back to
65:23 - our template file and find target X
65:32 - dashboard here whoa did you really find
65:38 - it crazy all right
65:43 - oops let me make this bigger sorry I am
65:46 - I don't know why I forgot to make this
65:49 - bigger all right so let's see wow we do
65:55 - have this here amazing target X - 4 hero
65:59 - all right so let's see what we can move
66:07 - you know what I want to remove this
66:08 - entire thing there's no reason why we
66:11 - need Franciscan University student will
66:13 - here when we have it right here we have
66:15 - the logo here it's entirely redundant
66:18 - and unnecessary let's just get rid of
66:20 - this entire section they're calling a
66:23 - hero section here and then we don't have
66:25 - to worry about trying to fit our logo
66:27 - into here this is going to save us a lot
66:29 - of time and I don't think that we're
66:33 - really gonna lose very much
66:34 - aesthetically by getting rid of this
66:37 - section and it's definitely gonna be
66:39 - worth it for the amount of time we'll
66:41 - save so let's for now I'm just gonna
66:45 - comment these out I do have a backup of
66:48 - this so we can mess it up as much as we
66:51 - want and I have backups but for now I
66:56 - think it's which it's still better if we
66:59 - just comment it out and then it'll make
67:01 - it that much easier to bring it back if
67:03 - somebody sees that and freaks out and
67:06 - wants it back
67:06 - so insert hero alright so I'm hoping
67:14 - that I don't get an error by taking
67:16 - things out but let's let's find out I
67:21 - know when we were working with c-sharp
67:23 - and we try to take some of the stuff out
67:25 - we got an error and we had to do some
67:28 - other stuff but this should be fun I was
67:35 - afraid that would happen
67:43 - shoot
67:48 - you know I'm just gonna take this out
67:50 - and user use your name shoot
68:05 - hold on a second I want to see what this
68:10 - is and if this is going to be important
68:12 - at some point
68:23 - yeah
68:32 - okay
68:34 - I think I do want to keep this this
68:38 - little user that's kind of a nice thing
68:40 - a nice personalized thing
68:44 - it was commented out though and I don't
68:48 - know if they just it was in there just
68:50 - for a demo of what it could do
69:05 - you know what let's log in and see what
69:08 - this really does on the interior pages
69:10 - so we're gonna need to sign up so it's
69:18 - great I bet I get admissions pamphlets
69:21 - and stuff mailed to me not maybe if I
69:31 - use my Franciscan do you address
69:33 - somebody in admissions will realize that
69:35 - like I have a user already
69:42 - all right fine then let's use a
69:45 - different email just a while Jima
69:58 - it actually wouldn't be a bad idea for
70:00 - me to get these mailings I'd like to see
70:02 - and then that way if there's any UI
70:03 - issues with the emails that they send
70:06 - out to prospective students I'll be able
70:07 - to see them where's my email
70:20 - okay well so the email that gets sent
70:22 - out check that out so that could
70:28 - definitely use some work I don't know
70:29 - how much control we have over that but
70:31 - there's a few things obviously it's not
70:33 - aesthetically pleasing at all I'm not
70:36 - the best at making emails but so I'm not
70:41 - really shouldn't be talking about this
70:43 - but that could use some improvement and
70:45 - look at the email the from email JRM
70:49 - team dot franciscan so this is not it
70:55 - should not be that it shouldn't be JRM
70:57 - team at Frances the Franciscan agenda
71:00 - board calm all right well I don't think
71:05 - I can change that right now off there
71:07 - just deal with it later on
71:20 - all right so I'm going to create a
71:22 - password
71:33 - on my other screen
72:06 - okay so I was making sure that I added
72:10 - all of that it's the last pass I don't
72:12 - forget it
72:14 - so let's let's login
72:29 - whoa
72:47 - interesting
72:58 - all right so we're dealing with
73:05 - and this is using angular for this this
73:11 - looks like angular they are okay so the
73:16 - once you login it's using angular ok
73:26 - so I guess we're gonna have to do a
73:29 - whole different set of styles for all
73:31 - the interior pages alright well good to
73:43 - know you're not gonna get to it today
73:45 - but definitely need some work okay so
74:02 - that's taking a lot longer than I would
74:04 - expect all right so my 25 minute timer
74:10 - is up and yeah it's definitely up so I'm
74:17 - gonna go back to the live chat I'm gonna
74:19 - go through all the questions now and
74:24 - then trying to think if there is
74:30 - something now for some reason I thought
74:38 - there was something I want something
74:39 - else I wanted to do but now I can't
74:41 - think of it so I'm just going to go over
74:42 - the questions in the live chat so pick
74:45 - up where we left off after the last
74:47 - break so we're done with the coding
74:48 - portion of it which is good because I
74:50 - can't get this page to refresh now
74:51 - anyway but really nice definitely I for
74:57 - sure wanted to get the header finished
74:59 - today and we accomplished that we
75:01 - actually got a little bit farther and
75:03 - started checking out the code for that
75:04 - hero section so it was a good day and
75:11 - hopefully you all got something out of
75:14 - that just for some CSS stuff I um wasn't
75:18 - quite as interactive as normal mostly
75:20 - because I hey I don't need as much help
75:23 - with the CSS alright so let me find out
75:33 - where I left off okay so the all right I
75:42 - can't pronounce his PA t vq i'm just
75:46 - gonna say the pat so the pat says hello
75:50 - i want to build a simple portfolio blog
75:53 - site so i can update my progress so make
75:58 - posts in learning coding do you know any
76:01 - tutorial with Django or nodejs blog
76:03 - creation yeah
76:12 - there's a there's a lot of different
76:14 - tutorials that you could go to I guess
76:19 - it kind of depends on how complicated
76:21 - you want to make it if if you want to do
76:27 - this project of a blog as a learning
76:29 - experience then you could try to make
76:32 - one from scratch using node or Django or
76:35 - whatever you want if the goal is just to
76:38 - get a blog up and running as fast as
76:40 - possible so you can you know start
76:42 - posting things then you could just run a
76:45 - wordpress blog very simply they have the
76:49 - five minute install which I mean
76:51 - literally it is five minutes or less
76:54 - so that would be the simplest thing to
76:57 - do but if you wanted to get a little bit
76:58 - more complex you could use what's it
77:01 - called
77:02 - is it Jekyll is that is that the like
77:06 - the static site kind of creator that a
77:10 - lot of people use for blogging there's
77:12 - something else too it's a ghost I can't
77:15 - remember all the names of it but yeah
77:17 - you can definitely you can get a blog up
77:23 - and running you know in less than an
77:26 - hour if you just do a simple WordPress
77:27 - blog or you can be more common if you
77:30 - wanted to get really complex and just
77:32 - work on your skills you could check out
77:34 - what we've done with the WordPress API
77:37 - and react and nodejs in our previous
77:40 - streams of project one project - and
77:45 - project four were all in slightly
77:48 - different ways basically building sites
77:51 - that have blog functionality even though
77:53 - we're not calling them blogs with
77:55 - WordPress node and react so depending on
77:59 - how complicated you want to get there's
78:00 - a lot of options out there for you
78:07 - Harshit says check traverse see media so
78:11 - I've never looked anything from Travis
78:13 - II but I have seen that recommended
78:14 - before so check that out
78:21 - Harris asked how well does free code
78:24 - can't prepare you for
78:29 - that's weird did that just take me to
78:32 - the main page the homepage it did that
78:43 - since that's not good oh shoot and
78:48 - that's not even what I wanted that's
78:53 - really weird actually let me take this
78:56 - out now before somebody sees this
78:58 - because I know this is probably a just a
79:01 - demo user but I doubt that they would
79:06 - want that let me remove that and this
79:11 - [Music]
79:30 - you just take the Sun okay there we go
79:35 - never this looks like one of my sites
79:38 - now right lots of white very plain the
79:43 - point is a site like this will load so
79:45 - fast right and users know what's gonna
79:49 - happen so they know what they're
79:53 - supposed to do anyway we'll clean this
79:55 - up tomorrow
79:56 - or some other Sun all right so it's re
80:01 - harris i am i got sidetracked so the
80:04 - question was how well does free code
80:05 - can't prepare you for salesforce
80:07 - development i learning the basics of
80:12 - HTML CSS and JavaScript will prepare you
80:15 - well for any kind of web development but
80:18 - in particular Salesforce development has
80:20 - a lot of things that are unique to
80:22 - Salesforce so any course that's not
80:25 - specifically Salesforce is not going to
80:27 - fully prepare you for it but you just
80:30 - see now we're making modifications to a
80:32 - Salesforce visualforce page and we're
80:39 - able to use so far basic HTML CSS so
80:44 - that base will be able to it will help
80:49 - you to to do a lot and then you can just
80:52 - pick up some of the the more platform
80:55 - specific things later on so the answer
81:00 - is is I guess not fully so free code
81:04 - kind of will not fully prepare you to
81:06 - develop for Salesforce but it's going to
81:07 - give you the necessary basic information
81:10 - to be able to then build on and learn
81:13 - some of those Salesforce specific things
81:26 - so says rook says the screensaver behind
81:29 - you is mesmerizing do I have a
81:31 - screensaver me and I maybe it was on I
81:33 - didn't even notice let me see I didn't
81:38 - realize you could see that oh oh I guess
81:40 - you can't see that screen this is a
81:43 - really old Windows laptop that I have an
81:46 - external monitor hooked up to and I
81:47 - never use it it doesn't even have an
81:49 - internet connection I used to use it for
81:53 - testing but I just can't stand it it's
81:55 - too slow I don't have patience to deal
81:59 - with that old slow computers Blake says
82:06 - I didn't catch what Salesforce's can you
82:08 - react splain it rooks rook recommended
82:14 - rewinding the livestream to see it I'll
82:17 - give you a very short explanation though
82:19 - in case you didn't do that or if anybody
82:20 - else is interested Salesforce is a
82:23 - platform that's mainly used by
82:25 - businesses to track customers or
82:29 - potential customers or clients get them
82:32 - in a sales funnel and track them along
82:35 - the progress of being a potential
82:37 - customer - you know actually being you
82:41 - know paying customer and then doing
82:43 - remarketing and things like that so it
82:46 - Salesforce can do a ton of stuff but I
82:48 - think basically that's the main goal of
82:52 - how a lot of people use sales was in our
82:56 - case for my university we're using this
82:58 - to help us organize the process that we
83:01 - go through to attract potential students
83:05 - and to have them you know actually go
83:07 - through the process of enrolling and
83:09 - coming to our University
83:18 - okay Harshit says I guess it's pas a
83:21 - platform as a service yeah yeah yes I
83:30 - think that would be accurate
83:57 - okay michael says regarding adam what
84:01 - packages are you using uh-huh a lot of
84:04 - faxes let me bring up let me show you my
84:13 - config yeah I'm just gonna scroll slowly
84:22 - through my packages
84:24 - I don't know this isn't gonna give it
84:27 - all is it shoot let me go to this you
84:35 - then I forget what the file is that
84:42 - shows all your packages
84:53 - so I'll zoom in oh I can't I was
84:58 - thinking I could save I'm just gonna
85:00 - scroll through these slowly so that you
85:04 - can check them out and then if you need
85:13 - to you can pause the video or rewind it
85:18 - later on okay
85:25 - so into my packages
85:45 - okay cool so some of you are saying
85:48 - where are you from so Tennessee so let
85:55 - me see so Dione is that let me know if
85:58 - I'm pronouncing that wrong D IO and any
86:00 - so I'm I'm thinking it's Dione but
86:04 - correct me please if I'm wrong from
86:06 - Tennessee so that's cool you're from
86:08 - Tennessee I'm going to be in Tennessee

86:12 - November so November 28th and 29th I
86:15 - don't know what day I'm speaking yet but
86:18 - I'll be in Nashville so if you're gonna
86:21 - be around Nashville and can go to a
86:24 - conference check it out it's called

86:37 - you're there come and say hi to me also
86:42 - if you have any recommendations for what

86:47 - please let me know if anybody has some
86:49 - natural recommendations cool Blake's
86:55 - from South Carolina cool I like I love
86:59 - Charleston South Carolina
87:01 - that's one of my favorite cities it's
87:03 - just I've I've rarely ever seen a city
87:07 - so beautiful as Charleston and the food
87:11 - there oh it's just amazing if you like
87:14 - seafood Charleston is the place to go
87:21 - let's see
87:30 - haha Michael said that that email that I
87:33 - showed earlier looked like a phishing
87:35 - email yeah it does that's a good point
87:38 - actually if I say that I think I'll
87:41 - definitely get the access or get that
87:43 - changed if I bring up the fact that it
87:45 - looks like phishing email so I'm really
87:48 - glad you said that Peter asks if I've
87:58 - ever played bf1942 so battlefield 1942 I
88:03 - have not
88:04 - is it good should I play it but let me
88:07 - is it a first-person shooter because if
88:09 - it is I can't play it I get really
88:12 - emotional a first-person shooters I
88:14 - can't handle it
88:15 - I used to take Dramamine which is a it's
88:20 - a pill that you can take that makes you
88:22 - it relieves motion sickness symptoms but
88:26 - it also makes you really tired so I used
88:28 - to take Dramamine at night play Call of
88:32 - Duty I'd play with my dad and then play
88:37 - until I was too tired and just fall
88:38 - asleep otherwise I'd be so sick
88:56 - michael says if you've got to fix that
88:58 - it might be time to ask for a raise
89:01 - actually I did I went to go make a joke
89:05 - to my boss earlier but he wasn't in his
89:07 - office but I was going to say hey now
89:10 - that I officially graduated from the
89:12 - Udacity react nano degree program I
89:14 - think it's time that I get paid more
89:16 - money I know that's not gonna happen
89:19 - right now but I just wanted to mess with
89:24 - him well maybe I'll check and see if
89:26 - he's here after know the strength
89:36 - okay cool allit Alessandra Alessandra or
89:42 - Alessandra let me know which way to
89:45 - pronounce it I don't want to mess it up
89:49 - says Gatsby J s that's I think that's
89:52 - what I was trying to think of Gatsby so
89:55 - that's for the I'm sorry I this for the
89:57 - blogging thing earlier we're talking
89:59 - about an easy way to get started
90:01 - blogging check out Gatsby jazz used it
90:05 - yet but I've heard really good things
90:07 - about it like at conferences and things
90:09 - so I I recommend it in the sense that
90:15 - I've I've heard that it's good okay cool
90:24 - Dion thanks for the the help with the
90:27 - pronunciation so it's Dion rhymes with
90:30 - neon awesome that's a great way to
90:32 - remember it
90:33 - so Dion says what skills are
90:36 - technologies do you consider to be
90:38 - intermediate front-end there are no
90:40 - junior level jobs in my area and a
90:42 - recruiter suggests that I apply for
90:44 - mid-level roles yeah definitely when it
90:47 - comes to applying for jobs do not be
90:49 - intimidated when you're trying when the
90:52 - Job Description seems like it's beyond
90:54 - which you can currently do apply anyway
90:57 - sometimes those job descriptions are
90:59 - written by people and Human Resources
91:01 - who are good at what they do but they
91:03 - have no idea what these coding terms
91:05 - mean so they'll go into the IT
91:09 - department or whatever department that's
91:11 - hiring a coder and say what do you need
91:13 - that coder to be able to do and they'll
91:16 - list a bunch of things that they'd like
91:19 - the person to do and then the HR person
91:21 - just puts them all down on a list not
91:23 - realizing that this kind of seems
91:25 - ridiculous to have somebody with all
91:27 - these different skills or I've dealt
91:31 - with that process of trying to make a
91:34 - job description that would make sense to
91:38 - a coder even though it didn't make sense
91:42 - to the HR people so anyway you never
91:46 - know what's going on behind the scenes
91:47 - with that so number
91:49 - one this isn't exactly a question but
91:52 - number one go for those jobs even if you
91:55 - don't think you have the skills yet also
91:57 - when it comes to intermediate front-end
91:59 - skills this is really it's kind of hard
92:02 - to it's hard to say for sure where that
92:07 - line between beginner and intermediate
92:08 - and then intermediate and expert is so I
92:11 - it's not like we could really give an
92:13 - exact you know place but I would say if
92:20 - you are to the point where and like I
92:24 - said this is entirely my opinion because
92:26 - I don't know that there's any for sure
92:29 - standard of what's intermediate but to
92:32 - me is someone claim that they were an
92:34 - intermediate level developer and were
92:36 - supplying for a job to work here I would
92:40 - want to see preferably on github I would
92:45 - want to see that they've been able to
92:48 - take a project completely build out the
92:52 - project connect to api's pull in data
93:00 - work with forms form validation handling
93:04 - form data I would want to see that
93:08 - they're able to use javascript
93:10 - techniques beyond just jQuery so whether
93:13 - that be some sort of framework like
93:15 - react angular paraview or others or
93:17 - whether that be they're using vanilla
93:19 - JavaScript or whatever but I want to see
93:22 - their beyond that I'd like also to see
93:25 - depending on the job it would be nice to
93:28 - see some custom CSS work so that they're
93:30 - going beyond just a normal framework the
93:33 - frameworks are really nice and I
93:35 - recommend using them whenever you can
93:37 - but it's nice to know that someone can
93:39 - adapt it as necessary so those are the
93:45 - skills that I would be looking for just
93:48 - in general it's hard to say you know
93:51 - because so much depends on specifically
93:54 - the the job and what needs to be done
93:56 - but but the big things are they can do
94:01 - things from scratch with the
94:02 - that makes sense or adaptive framework
94:05 - they can do more than just basic jQuery
94:09 - and actually do some more advanced
94:12 - JavaScript things that can potentially
94:14 - mean being able to handle using a
94:17 - framework and if it's like reacting a
94:20 - frame where they can manage state
94:21 - properly and then can they interact with
94:25 - api's can they pull data make sure that
94:31 - you know make sure that their sites are
94:34 - checking you go they're check-in these
94:36 - they're validating their form inputs are
94:38 - they checking to make sure that when you
94:41 - know data comes and when it's not when
94:43 - it's not there are they providing fall
94:45 - backs like you know error messages like
94:47 - things that things that separate the
94:51 - work from being like just a project that
94:53 - you're doing and being something that is
94:55 - actually deployable live and is reliable
95:02 - anyway so that was probably kind of
95:05 - vague I'm sorry if it if it was too
95:08 - vague for you but hopefully that that
95:10 - helps a little bit but in general my
95:14 - advice for that kind of thing is just
95:16 - keep working and keep pushing yourself
95:17 - and doing projects and keep applying you
95:21 - just you never know what's really going
95:22 - on
95:23 - and when a job description is created so
95:26 - it's worth a shot to applied it to
95:27 - anything that you're even remotely
95:29 - interested in okay Blake said did you
95:36 - see my question on Ajax I did not let me
95:39 - scroll up okay I'm sorry Blake I don't
95:47 - know how I missed that
95:48 - Blake's question is I'm sending data to
95:51 - a Google sheet using Ajax and in two of
95:53 - my fields I get undefined
95:55 - docs.google.com spreadsheet oh okay I
96:01 - checked all my name attributes code is
96:05 - like two on this up state all right let
96:08 - me check I actually have your your
96:12 - github
96:14 - open right now on another in another
96:16 - window so it's github upstate okay so
96:29 - this is assuming it's in contact je s
96:34 - yeah that's for your sending a Google
96:36 - sheet okay I'll check that out after the
96:39 - shingon all the time it is yeah if I
96:43 - have time today I'll check it out after
96:45 - the stream otherwise maybe I'll check it
96:46 - out tomorrow and I'll let you know
96:50 - maybe I'll just submit a pull request I
96:52 - don't know we'll see
96:54 - anyway I see it now sorry I missed that
96:57 - before Blake I've worked with sending
97:01 - form data to Google sheets before so
97:03 - hopefully I'll be able to sort it out
97:05 - now I won't be able to see what code you
97:07 - have going on on your Google sheet in
97:11 - Google Apps Script so if the problem is
97:15 - on that side of things obviously I can't
97:18 - do it and I won't be able to fully test
97:20 - it out so if it's something obvious that
97:23 - I can see I can help with otherwise I
97:25 - probably won't be able to help I can
97:30 - always maybe try to make my own she will
97:33 - see how much time I have
97:54 - okay Deon says darn I have to work
97:59 - is it live-streamed actually I I don't
98:02 - think it's gonna be live-streamed we
98:05 - actually add so on Twitter there was a
98:07 - conversation back and forth between the
98:10 - people that are running the conference
98:11 - and somebody from the livestream who was
98:14 - it I can't remember now who it was about
98:17 - live streaming stuff from the conference
98:20 - from November and it didn't seem like it
98:25 - was going to happen that it would be
98:26 - live streamed so probably won't get live
98:29 - streamed if the Internet's good enough I
98:32 - might try to shoot some footage if I'm
98:34 - allowed in either live stream it or
98:37 - upload it to YouTube it's going to place
98:41 - it'll depend on the quality of the
98:42 - internet there so I'll try to put out
98:45 - some content no matter what I know the
98:49 - keynote talks are going to be put on
98:52 - YouTube I don't think they'll be live
98:54 - streamed so I may or may not my talk may
98:58 - or may not be on YouTube so we'll see
99:11 - how cool Blake says it's nice so we when
99:13 - I was talking about Charleston South
99:15 - Carolina Blake says it's nice I live in
99:17 - Greenville it's probably the second
99:18 - nicest cool I've never been to
99:20 - Greenville maybe I've five a chance off
99:23 - to check out Greenville to
99:40 - okay Deon says thanks for your input to
99:42 - my question you're welcome
99:44 - they said hopefully that that had helped
99:46 - let me know if you have any follow-up
99:47 - questions or anything either in the
99:49 - stream or you can send me a message on
99:51 - Twitter or whatever social media be more
99:53 - than happy that answer any questions you
99:56 - have especially if it's something more
100:01 - specific sometimes people prefer to ask
100:04 - more specific questions over you know
100:07 - Twitter or something like in a direct
100:08 - message so I'm I'm up for that too
100:11 - sometimes if I'm really busy I can't
100:13 - always get back to you right away but
100:15 - I'll try with it to get back to you
100:17 - within a couple of days
100:32 - okay Blake saying asking if I want the
100:36 - Google script yeah actually if you could
100:38 - send me the the Google script then that
100:44 - would be helpful because then I could
100:46 - make my own and and test it
100:58 - Harris says what's your schedule like
101:00 - how do you balance we're teaching plus
101:03 - keep on learning more so I'm actually
101:06 - not teaching so my work here is I'm a
101:09 - full-time front-end developer so my
101:13 - workday is it's supposed to be an
101:16 - eight-hour workday but that includes one
101:18 - hour for lunch
101:20 - sometimes my hours are weird and it
101:22 - doesn't work out like that but in
101:25 - general that's pretty much my schedule
101:27 - of work I usually work on Saturdays on
101:33 - on learning more so if I have a class or
101:37 - a client on the side I do that work on
101:40 - Saturdays sometimes I do it before I
101:43 - come to work and on my lunch breaks
101:45 - occasionally I work at night during the
101:48 - week so I don't really have a consistent
101:52 - schedule for that other than Saturdays
101:55 - so I don't like to always work on
101:59 - Saturdays because I do want to spend
102:01 - time with with my family and I for four
102:04 - kids eight years old and under so I'll
102:08 - probably be taking a break from working
102:09 - on Saturdays now for for a while I'm I
102:12 - don't know we'll see unless something
102:14 - comes up like a project or client i I
102:16 - don't maybe I'll take a break until till
102:21 - after the new year he's I've been pretty
102:24 - busy since basically this whole year
102:28 - with side projects so that's kind of how
102:34 - I managed to learn more with the
102:37 - teaching thing I'm I was actually hoping
102:40 - to be able to teach a little bit in the
102:42 - computer science department this
102:44 - semester but things kind of fell through
102:46 - with I was planning on doing some sort
102:49 - of team teaching thing but the schedule
102:52 - of the teacher that I was team teaching
102:53 - with things are a little weird it didn't
102:56 - work out so I'm hoping that maybe next
102:58 - year it'll happen I don't know that I
103:00 - would want to teach an entire course all
103:03 - by myself and deal with paperwork and
103:05 - all that stuff but if I could team teach
103:07 - and just come in and teach certain
103:09 - topics and not how
103:10 - to worry about all the other stuff the
103:12 - administrative tasks that come along
103:14 - with teaching I definitely be up for
103:15 - that there's a web development course
103:18 - here in the computer science department
103:20 - that I would love to get in there and
103:21 - you know teach some of the newer
103:24 - techniques for web development but for
103:27 - now I like doing what I'm doing so I
103:34 - don't really have like a burning desire
103:36 - to teach I used to teach high school and
103:40 - it was nice but I'm not I love what I'm
103:45 - doing right now so if it happens and I
103:47 - get to teach that'll be cool because I'd
103:48 - really like to help out the students
103:50 - here and help them to get some good
103:52 - experience on projects but I'm not
103:56 - actively pursuing that if it happens it
103:58 - happens and if in terms of the balance
104:04 - the balance is hard so I don't always
104:06 - feel like I have a balance between work
104:08 - and and learning and my family so it's
104:15 - just something you kind of just strive
104:17 - for every day and if you mess up with it
104:20 - and you get out of balance you try to do
104:21 - better but it's just it's hard
104:26 - especially with kids you can't always
104:29 - plan everything out you know things
104:30 - happen a kid gets sick and you got to
104:32 - stay up all night with them or you know
104:35 - that that throws off your schedule so
104:39 - you just can't it's just hard to have
104:42 - like a set schedule and plan things
104:45 - when you have all those those unknown
104:47 - variables with with the kids that demand
104:49 - attention you can't just tell the kid
104:51 - wait you know and I'll get to it
104:53 - especially when you have babies like
104:55 - they depend on you for everything so you
104:57 - got to be there so I don't think there's
105:02 - one like clear answer to getting that
105:04 - perfect work-life balance you just got
105:10 - to be ready to adapt you know and then
105:15 - realize that sometimes you'll go through
105:16 - periods where you're able to do a lot
105:18 - one way or the other you may not be able
105:22 - to have a perfect balance
105:23 - every day so that you do these certain
105:25 - things you know depends on your
105:27 - situation Michael asked do you think
105:35 - freelance sites like up work are worth
105:37 - worth it to try out I'm not that
105:41 - familiar with up work let me look
105:44 - I haven't had great results with
105:50 - freelance sites
106:01 - okay upwork looks a lot like top towel
106:04 - and I I haven't worked for top towel but
106:08 - the concept looks the same and I
106:10 - actually like the concept so the concept
106:13 - is more like this up work or top towel
106:17 - is the middleman and they try to pair
106:19 - you up with clients and they handle all
106:22 - the contracts paperwork payments all
106:25 - that stuff and you just get to do the
106:27 - work I'm actually a big fan of that
106:30 - setup although like I said I haven't
106:32 - worked for them for any you big company
106:36 - like that so can't say about a personal
106:41 - experience but I like that the sites
106:43 - that I don't like and I don't think are
106:45 - worth it or the sites where I think one
106:49 - sites called freelancer freelancer yet
106:58 - is where you go on there and it just
107:03 - seems like people are doing work for for
107:07 - nothing you know they're trying to
107:08 - outbid each other
107:10 - undercut the prices it did it just
107:17 - doesn't seem worth it unless you have
107:18 - nowhere else to go and you really need
107:20 - to build up your portfolio people just
107:24 - aren't being paid what they should be
107:26 - what they're worth so then anyway that's
107:30 - my opinion on it like I said I don't
107:32 - have a ton of personal experience with
107:35 - all the different kinds of sites that do
107:37 - that that sort of thing so as long as if
107:45 - the sites encouraging developers to
107:48 - undercut each other in price I'd say
107:50 - stay away from it if instead the site is
107:53 - actually helping developers get paid
107:55 - what they should get paid and making it
107:57 - easier for them to find clients then
108:00 - great I'm all for that so just check out
108:04 - check out the site and see if you can
108:07 - get ahold of people or talk to people
108:08 - that that are actually working with that
108:10 - company and see what they think
108:17 - now Luke says the screensaver is back
108:20 - okay I see it now I can see it in my
108:23 - [Music]
108:24 - that is kind of cool I never see it
108:28 - because it's always behind me
108:41 - Harris says here's an idea freakout cam
108:44 - should provide productivity tips in
108:46 - videos or vlog format yeah that would
108:50 - actually be pretty cool I'd have to
108:55 - think about it I could probably do
108:57 - something
108:59 - I certainly have complete freedom to
109:01 - post videos on my own YouTube channel I
109:03 - have to probably run it by Quincy if I
109:06 - wanted to do a different style of video
109:11 - but he'd probably be okay with it as
109:14 - long as I came up with topics and the
109:16 - quality was good so you think about that
109:20 - and there probably other people that can
109:22 - do it you have much better quality
109:25 - videos than me and have better you know
109:28 - better topics a better opinion so yeah
109:33 - but that's a good idea I'll keep that in
109:35 - mind yeah let me know what kind of
109:41 - things you you all would like to hear
109:44 - about and I can either work it in the
109:45 - live stream or try to do videos and put
109:48 - it on my youtube channel I'm I'm open to
109:52 - suggestions
110:08 - my screensaver is is keeping everybody's
110:12 - attention now there we go you want me to
110:20 - block try to block it out I guess I can
110:22 - it's still there let's see okay sorry I
110:35 - Harris says oh by teaching I meant these
110:38 - live streams ok sorry that makes so much
110:42 - more sense now I just I never think
110:45 - about this as teaching it's because I
110:46 - it's it's way more collaborative than
110:49 - normal teaching so that makes a lot of
110:53 - sense that sorry I misunderstood so
110:57 - Harris says I meant by a teaching I
110:59 - meant these live streams I had a
111:00 - professor who ended up teaching half the
111:02 - semester through a youtube live that's
111:04 - really cool
111:05 - I would that I would like to do it like
111:10 - that not have to actually go into the
111:12 - classroom and just I think it would be
111:15 - easier because if I'm teaching like I
111:17 - want to I'm teaching code stuff the most
111:20 - important thing is that people can see
111:21 - my screen see what's on it so it would
111:27 - almost be better if I just live stream
111:29 - then all the students could have the
111:32 - code right there on their computers
111:35 - anyway okay yeah so the good actually
111:40 - there is one way there's one key reason
111:44 - why I'm able to do these streams and
111:46 - stream as frequently and as long as I do
111:49 - and that is because I get to stream
111:52 - while I'm at work so that's why I work
111:55 - on the projects that I need to for my
111:57 - job and so in that sense I can't always
112:02 - work on what I really want to but it's
112:05 - fine I think we still do good good
112:07 - projects and because I can do it at work
112:10 - it doesn't cut into my time that I would
112:14 - have with my family so it would be hard
112:17 - for me to be able to spend this much
112:18 - time if it was taking time away
112:20 - my family especially since I'm
112:22 - volunteering you know it'd be hard to
112:25 - explain to my wife that hey can you
112:28 - watch the kids for another like three
112:30 - hours every day so that I could do this
112:33 - and we're not getting any more money so
112:36 - you could see how that would be a hard
112:38 - sell so thankfully my boss sees real
112:43 - value and what I'm doing in terms of
112:48 - several reasons one the University's
112:52 - name gets out there to a lot of places
112:55 - that no one probably was never heard of
112:57 - this University before which is good
112:59 - also I learned so much from you all you
113:03 - can to contribute to project so these
113:05 - projects end up being so much better
113:07 - than they ever would be if it was just
113:10 - me doing it so essentially my boss is
113:13 - giving this time away by letting me work
113:17 - on it for free code camp and in return
113:19 - though the university is is gaining you
113:23 - know some publicity and gaining some
113:24 - expertise from you all so I think it's a
113:28 - it's a very nice kind of trade-off there
113:32 - so hopefully I can continue to do this
113:34 - and it still is beneficial for for you
113:37 - all for free code camp and for the
113:39 - University and everything can keep
113:41 - working out like this
113:48 - [Music]
113:51 - all right Rick asks what is the most
113:54 - effective object-oriented programming
113:56 - language to learn in a short timeframe
113:58 - to land an entry job any suggestions I
114:07 - don't have that much experience with
114:09 - other programming languages but honestly
114:12 - the easiest language for me to learn out
114:14 - of all the other ones that I did that I
114:16 - worked on
114:27 - I don't know let me think about that for
114:30 - a second
114:40 - probably Python
114:49 - yeah Python so just to give some context
114:53 - I have worked with C++ C sharp PHP Java
115:04 - and Python and some of that was just
115:10 - doing basic tutorials but Python did
115:14 - seem to be the easiest for me to pick up
115:19 - so Python right now is really big with
115:22 - machine learning and stuff like that so
115:25 - if you're interested in that field then
115:28 - I would check it out
115:40 - also Python is cool because it's one of
115:42 - the few programming languages that it's
115:44 - really doable to code on a phone because
115:48 - it's more about indentation and less
115:50 - about special characters which usually
115:52 - take several clicks to get to on a phone
115:54 - so I actually learned Python on my
115:58 - iPhone and by learned I mean like
116:04 - learned enough to do really basic stuff
116:06 - I'm not at all an expert on Python world
116:14 - says do all frameworks use Ajax under
116:17 - the hood no I don't they don't all use
116:21 - Ajax and like I don't want to get into
116:25 - obaid over what's the difference between
116:26 - a framework and a library because we've
116:28 - we've had that before but using like the
116:32 - loose definition of those things if you
116:36 - would want to consider react in that
116:40 - general category of framework which I
116:43 - know we've had debates before and it's
116:47 - probably better called a library but
116:50 - anyway someone like that doesn't
116:53 - actually use anything so you're free to
116:55 - use whatever you want so you could use
116:58 - Ajax you could do just basic xhr you
117:01 - could use fetch what's the other one
117:07 - that people always like I can't remember
117:09 - there's some other way to do it no it's
117:15 - totally slipping my mind I always have
117:17 - suggestions from people to use it but
117:20 - anyway it doesn't actually come built-in
117:24 - so I guess the answer would be no not
117:31 - necessarily
118:02 - okay I've gotten to the end of the live
118:05 - chat I was just double-checking to make
118:06 - sure I didn't miss anything if I did
118:08 - miss something really sorry
118:12 - you can ask it again in tomarrow stream
118:15 - or send me a message on some social
118:16 - media network let's see alright that's
118:28 - it for today I should be back tomorrow I
118:32 - don't think I have anything going on so
118:34 - it should be around the normal time
118:36 - somewhere around 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time
118:38 - I will be back we're probably going to
118:40 - be working on this this app some more
118:45 - this has been a project that I've had
118:48 - since May and I keep putting it off
118:51 - because it didn't need to be done so
118:53 - finally I just want to get it done so
118:56 - that when I finally get asked if I did
118:58 - this
118:58 - which nobody's asked me about it which
119:00 - is another reason why I haven't done it
119:01 - when I finally get asked if I did it I
119:04 - can just say hey check it out and it'll
119:06 - be done and and everyone will be
119:08 - impressed
119:08 - so it'll be this for a little while
119:11 - until we get it done I don't think it'll
119:13 - take that long hopefully not so anyway
119:17 - I'll see you all tomorrow until then
119:19 - have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse today we're going to do something that we've never done before on the stream we're going to work with Salesforce in particular we're going to edit some visualforce pages so I'm going to start out with a little introduction of Salesforce since we've never used it before you may not be familiar with it so sales forces as a product is huge and does a lot of different things so I'm only going to talk about the little piece that we're going to work with because I'm definitely not a an expert on Salesforce it would take quite a lot of research and training to learn it you know everything that it can do so I've learned enough to be able to do what we're gonna do today and even if you have no idea about Salesforce or what it does as long as you know basic HTML and CSS you'll be able to follow this string cuz that's really what we're going to deal with maybe we use some JavaScript we'll see I don't think we'll need to but you never know so Salesforce basically it's it's mostly used by companies who want to track like leads customers right so a marketing tool we at the university that work at use it a little bit differently in that the university you don't have customers in the same sense that maybe another company would have you know like a retail store or something so we have a prospective students right so students usually high school students who are interested in coming to to our schools so there are various ways that they reach out to us so we have an inquiry form for those students who are just you know kind of interested but then we also have an online an application that's what we're gonna be working on today and so what happens is when we have a student who's interested in coming here they get into the Salesforce system and then they're put into categories and there's data available for our admissions counselors it gets them into let's say like what you'd normally call a sales funnel although we don't really consider its sales and as they progress through the stages and then different things might happen they might get different materials so let's see it looks like there's audio popping all right let me try to move my chords around and get them away from my mic all right let me know if you're still getting the pocket that's odd some days I think it has to do with where I'm putting my phone and where the my phones usually plugged into my computer it usually has to do with where it is some days it's fine and other days it's twohour anyway it's Fitz fix that's cool but anyway we're going to deal with that part of the process where a student has decided that they're interested enough in our university that they actually want to fill out an application to go here so we need to work on this application right now we're using an application that does funnel data into Salesforce eventually I did a lot of work on the current application to get it looking as nice as I possibly could but there were a lot of limitations so I have no direct access so I guess I could it would be better if I showed you the current application instead of just talking about it so the URL is not easy to remember so I'm going to go in through this way supply okay so the application to look at it is not terrible it actually shares a lot of the styles that you've seen that we've worked on in other other applications so the header should look familiar the white you know the three pixel gold border the shadows even the shadows on the card so everything is is the same even you know this material design style of the of the inputs so this was all done though with CSS that had to override what was already in there so all the only access I have to this is I was able to have the company that made this put in a link to a CSS file on a server that I do the popping is back you know what I'm just gonna unplug my phone completely and put it somewhere else let's put my foot over here all right so my phone I just now threw it in a chair on the other side of the room so if the popping is still there we'll know it's not my phone at least if if the popping is still there after that then I'll switch up to the the builtin mic on the iMac I think we try to fix this on another stream and I figure okay it's good now all right if it comes back please let me know I'll just quit using this mic let's see where was that I got I got offtrack oh okay we're looking at this so basically the problem is I only can just do CSS work to it so I was limited in what I really could do like you know these inputs there there are little things that I couldn't make it exactly like the other the other forms okay and then on the back end of things there are some other some other problems and I'm not going to go through this form now but basically you need a there's a page refresh that happens every time you go to a different page so it's not a modern experience like you would get in a progressive web app or a single page application where you know you'd be able to navigate around without having the page refresh happen all the time so you you understand what I'm saying I mean the technologies are I don't know how you can see that or not but I mean it's it's jQuery base so the new application we can see we're getting a little bit better here still using some jQuery stuff which is understandable everybody uses jQuery but at least we're using a more modern responsive framework so they're actually using bootstrap for this okay so not bad so what we need to do then is change these default styles to match up more in line something like this it's not gonna look exactly the same but we need to use those same styles we've been using on all our projects it's going to be a little bit different though because we're not gonna have our normal dev environment set up we're gonna have like I just looked check the live chat and are sure that's what extension that is it's wet lap eliezer w APPA al y zer so I'll type that into the live chat so anyway that extension is pretty convenient to be able to just see what's with you don't really have to look at the code just with a click you can see what a website is built with so I'm always curious to see how people do things so this lets me just take a look quickly okay so that's basically you know what we're gonna do we're just going to try to get as much done as possible I don't expect to be able to get everything styled you know properly in here but for today it would be nice if we could get the header looking like the standard header that we've had the white header with the web logo on our gold border at the bottom and the correct shadow also we need to figure out what we're gonna do with this area here I'm not sure how I feel about this yet so maybe you can try a couple different things out I'll tell you what I'm thinkin so y'all can think about it though III see basically two options here I I don't like just this little strip of a of an image to be honest with you this page right here is just to sign up actually this is is me go to the first page login I think the first page is the login page ok this is the first page users will see the whole point is login so why do we have this big image and title here and push the login down far go to the bottom right the user needs to login they're not here to look at images so I'm thinking either completely get rid of the image and just have a very very simple login screen that it's obvious right away login here there's nothing else you can do just login or make some type of full screen background image with the login floating on top of it that way at least the login will stand out more and we'll have the image and the image will obviously be the not the focus it will be in the background and the focus of everything will be the sign and so either way my goal is to have the signin card be the focus so y'all can let me know what you think when we get to that point first things first let's get this header in better shape so let me pull over where do I have it yea let me pull over this Salesforce page and also let me know what the quality of the video is so YouTube changed how you do live streaming and you used to have the option to set beforehand what quality you wanted the video to be but now they took it away and I guess they automatically detect it I want to make sure that we're still able to get 1080p video so I'm trying to check the analytics it looks like some of you are watching in 1080p so I assume since that's happening then from my end it's it's alright I'm over five five thousand kilobits per second so I'm it should be good enough for at 1080p okay so this is what we'll be working with as our file so within Salesforce so if this is the oldschool view of Salesforce so they do have an updated UI my organization is not switched over to the updated UI yet I can do a preview of it if I really want to but by default I still see the old views so if you are using Salesforce if you're a version of Salesforce may look different the how I got to here so probably may not be a big deal if you don't use Salesforce but in case you do I'll just quickly go over how I got here so up in the upper right hand corner for me there is a setup if you're using the newer version there'll be a little Settings icon you know like the little looks like a gear within the settings icon then you can click setup either way once you get to setup you go over here it's gonna look different depending on the version but they'll still be this this sidebar here and you want to go to develop and then expand that and go to visualforce pages then you're going to be given a huge list of available pages figure out what page you want click it and then you're in here the first screen you get won't be this it'll it'll show some info but it's not editable if you have the proper level of permissions in Salesforce there'll be an edit button click Edit and that's how you get into here so I know that was really fast I just don't spend that much time on it if anybody wants to talk about it more later on let me know during the question and answer session let's see I'm trying to find my my timer so don't forget here we go and I will bring it up here ok so let's set that 25 minute timer and get to work ok so I need to figure out a way to make this look a little nicer actually let me pull this out let's pull all this code out and put it in a code editor it'll be a lot easier to see it in a proper editor so I'm just gonna pull this into this page and let's set since this is HTML hopefully it'll it'll deal with these custom tags yeah that's not about it it looks like it's dealt properly with some of these custom tags so basically Salesforce has their own I guess maybe like a templating system it's this apex so a PE X right so they have these apex tags so think of this as I don't know if I want to call them exactly components like in the react if you have components but I it's somewhat like that alright so it operates something like that we could see that it allows us to insert you know variables dynamic content into the HTML so I guess in a sense it does it's you could think of in a similar way teraz react lets you mix javascript in the HTML I know it's really not that it's it's more you put HTML and a JavaScript function but this is a similar thing that we get to put programming concepts right in this case variables into into HTML we're not really going to be messing with that that much though I don't want to mess with what this does by default what I do want to change is the container the HTML shell that's around this so let's see I just remembered I didn't really check the live chat yet so hey everybody just want to see what's going on quickly before I start okay so let's just briefly go through some of this you can see this looks aside from all these apex tags it's a basic HTML page right you have your HTML at your head title tag you know all your links that are bringing in write your icons your JavaScript CSS C we're bringing in bootstrap here they do have some custom CSS where I have been unable to locate in Salesforce where this file is this target X dot CSS I would love to be able to just edit this file directly but I can't find it and I've already spent too much time looking for it so I've just given up on that and we're just gonna add our own CSS and we may end up putting it in a style tag or we could link to it from something else we'll see I can see pros and cons to either way alright so now we get to the body I just put in this class body test just to make sure I had there were a few templates that were all named very similar names so I needed to make sure which one was actually the active template so that's why I've added this in so I'm gonna remove this now since it served its purpose whoops I went to save it well what I'll do is maybe we can make changes here with art so we could use our editor and then at periodically we'll just copy and paste everything into here so I realize changes I make here are gonna do anything yet but I think that'll allow us to take advantage of some of what we the features we have in our code editor it'll probably be easier in the long run to do it like that ok so we have our nav component and and remember if you used to bootstrap try to think in in bootstrap mode in terms of when you see some of these classes they may be familiar to you now this page is actually really basic and that mo of the markup is going to be injected you know with with these apex tags so we're not gonna be able to see everything we may have to do some digging if we really want to change something but I think we'll be able to get a lot done with the combination of this template and chrome dev tools and we may not even have to dig in and find these files this actually feels very similar to what we are doing with that dotnet framework main website page that we were working on a few weeks ago okay so alright so we have some things comment it out okay so this file actually you can see is very very simple like I said really at this point all we're gonna be doing with it is using it to add in some of our styles so let's get to work on picking out some of the things that we want to change so we're gonna go in with dev tools I am for this particular window I'm using Chrome Canary if you're not familiar with Chrome Canary it's the latest version of Chrome I don't know that it's necessarily like the cuttingedge version they might there might be a better version but it's pretty stable and it allowed the reason I like to use this sometimes is that it gives you access to new features and dev tools before they are released into regular chrome when I'm testing a site I like to use the regular version of Chrome because the odds of a user actually using Chrome Canary are super low so anyway so my dev tools may look a little bit different than yours and actually let me let me copy and paste this into the live chat the link I didn't test to see if this was available to everyone but I assume it is I guess I could let's see alright yeah that should be available to everyone actually let's update our Chrome Canary write it canary has updates so frequently which is ok you can see it only took a second to update ok now let's go into our dev tools and let me try to get this so I'm not worried about these errors because I really can't do much about them anyway like I said there are some files that I have not been able to find so I can't fix that so let's save some space and just minimize that and let me know is this font size too small in dev tools I can probably expand it a bit and make it a little bigger I'm afraid if I get too big we just won't be able to see things all right so let's try to target this a nav bar and I've already the only thing I've done is I've pulled in the low the proper logo and I'm actually I'm maybe going to find a better solution than this but right now I'm just linking directly to the logo that's on that Resource Center that we that we built maybe a month or so ago ok so we're gonna have that's interesting so it looks like we're gonna go the nav component itself yeah the napkin phone is what we want yeah ok so here in the nav component let's change some what we're doing we don't want a border at all so I don't think yeah first let's let's do some things to cancel out some of the styles that are in there you can see these are coming from bootstrap I have no desire to edit bootstrap directly I think that's a mistake so let's just work with what we have so we're gonna go bordernone so we have no border there but then now we want to do a border bottom and we're gonna go with three pixels solid and we need to grab that gold color and I always forget what it is so where is it this is the fastest way for me to get this gold color probably in this project that's fine CSS we don't anything in our CSS let's see if I can find where we use this then we put in our app bar nope do not put it in here I do not remember where we put all of the styles a few guys theme that's gotta be it we didn't even put it in there alright enough of that that's a waste waste of time let's go here and just inspect this one very an h1 really that whole things in H tag you see what kind of ridiculous stuff happens sometimes when you don't have control over the markup my entire at bar at the top is an h1 tag it's insane it's an h1 to anyway that stuff just it just amazes me sometimes but this is actually this is what I had to do to make an AB bar the only element that would work for this was an h1 so anyway uhhuh that's just that's just the way it is sometimes you gotta work with what you have okay bringing back all these memories of when I actually did that work and how frustrating it was it's it's a mix of fun and frustration it's fun because it's like I can't believe I just took this crazy markup and it made something that looked decent with it and then frustration because it's like all I need is a div right here and you can't do anything you can't put the div in okay cool so we have our border at the bottom now we need our shadows so let's grab we could check the shadows here yeah I guess we'll just use these shadows I do want to make sure that they match actually these do look like the newer shadows initially we use slightly different values and I'm talking like maybe a year ago or something we had slightly different shadow values and then materialized CSS updated and added a third line here in their box shadow and so I don't I don't remember what we updated what we didn't so anyway that does look good that looks like the right values so let's use those so we're gonna throw in this whoa it's not let me paste that in that's let's try again we're just gonna grab the values this son and we'll type box shadow on our own sometimes paste thing into dev tools can be a little weird if you paste if you accidentally paste the wrong stuff it just rejects it yes it worked that time awesome whoa maybe it didn't what did I do oh I type accidentally Ted bucks sizing box shadow that's what we want okay great and that should work let's check back here we can't really see it but there should be a shadow you can slightly see the shadow so all right cool so we have that down the basics down there it's not what I wanted so let's grab these and pull them over huh I'm actually not sure what the best way to to do these styles is you know what let's um for now let's just open up another another file here and whoops let's let's just start putting styles in a file and then that way we don't have to make a decision on where to put the styles and yet never yeah let's just use nav bar dot nav are there we go okay actually let me save this in case something happens and I guess I should say this is a project so let's make a new folder and call this so forth yeah I'll just call it Salesforce and let's go application dot CSS okay cool so now we can let's try to make this logo look like it should look so we need every nerve container assuming it's in here there we go so target X header University icon wow that that is quite a quite a large class so I'm just gonna paste that class in here right now so now we're gonna be using that and let's see it's just it's simply a background image so you can see the background image it goes back to this default so we're gonna take that background image and we're definitely going to keep that at least for now we're gonna keep that that URL so we'll have that in our file now what we want to do is add in some some options here see you check my timer alright good eleven minutes let's see so wow it's been a while since I just did straightup CSS its background let's go background repeat' cuz we definitely don't want to repeat no repeat and then background is it sighs there's so many background properties there we go that's what I wanted sighs cover contain container I don't want I guess contain is what we want for now and then okay we need to set it with let's go with actually there we go that looks good let's check that out for a minute okay what's that sighs look actually I like that sighs that's not too bad let me see what it looks like here nice all right that's actually it was a breakpoint I think we'll be fine even great all right I really like that I think that's perfect so let's let's copy this over and paste it I do want to see if we even need this no repeat that's yep we definitely need that I was hoping we we didn't need it when we put the contain on but we will so always worth it to try to save a line of code though there we go okay awesome all right so it looks like our header is looking a lot closer to what we our standard header is now we definitely want to change I don't mind this this online application I actually really like this font off to double check and see what font this is I'm just I'm interested in seeing what they have loaded already let's see the font family hi it's just open sans that looks really nice being being thin like that obviously we're going to import Roboto that's the font that we use for everything I'm not going to do it right now though we'll see how things go so I think with let's change this to that green color the font color to green and then we'll change these icons to green I hope I just got to do this I really really hope these are font icons or SVG's if not we're gonna totally replace these icons actually we might replace these icons no matter what before we're using an interesting huh really interesting okay so here's what I'd like to do I'm a just now I think about it I may actually just remove the icons I don't think we need any icons there sign up and log in or find the thing here's the one thing I did not like about those icons okay obviously those weren't material design so icons but aside from that it seemed to me like that icon was supposed to be a male a silhouette of a male head okay so I would rather use an icon for a person that would be genderneutral that's just a personal preference for me and I think I think users would appreciate that even if it's just they don't realize it I I prefer to do it like that so in this case I actually like it better without the icons I think the icon and the text was unnecessary so let's while we're down here let's grab all this and we're gonna reset the content let me grab all this and calendar before email before you had our user all right let's get rid of this because I don't want to mess with those yet what I do want to worry about is this header user before now I'm assuming that that's what this is content and then we're just gonna give it that let's double check target X header user yep that is what we wanted okay great so now that's gonna remove that for us while we're down here let's um let's see where we're getting the font color from target X header you so it is in fact on that target X header user okay so we're gonna have to grab this header print counter you know you know what let's grab all this and change the color of it ok this will be that green color so actually I used to have the highlight that worked an atom that showed the color but it was throwing all kind of errors it's the pigments is the the package and it's thrown all kind of errors so I turned it off so you can't see the color that was always nice but not necessary ok great so that should be fine for the font color let's let's just change it here just so that we can get a nice visual okay there we go and all right let's see what we have here where we're getting that color from Target etc university name great let's just add this here we can manually add it in here just so we can see it great okay now I'm gonna change the font the font way the size probably at some point for now this is okay I just want to see what the colors look like and I want to see what the color looks like for this online application but I think the gray might it might work out it might look nice with the gray so we're gonna try it but maybe we'll switch it back so let's see actually let me do this I'm gonna add in an another attribute and that way we can switch back and forth 52 colors more easily okay so here's the green let's zoom out because a user will almost never be zoomed in that much and we're going to toggle back and forth hmm interesting I'm not I'm not sure that I have a preference by their way so here's what I'm going to do let's put this in here and we'll just make a little note so that later on we can make a decision on that okay my timer is up so I'm going to do five minutes of questionandanswer in the live chat and then we'll do another 25minute session of just some CSS this is actually pretty fun for me I I mean I started out doing a lot of CSS just like this people would come to me with existing sites that needed work done and I would go in there and just try to make the best of it so this is very like natural and fun for me so I'm having a good time hopefully you are enjoying it as well I read an article yesterday I forget where it was from but the article was someone recalling a conversation they had with a person who was attempting to hire developers that could work with just regular HTML and CSS they said they were having trouble finding people like that they could find people that knew how to use frameworks they could use angular react view and do really well but anytime they asked him to do just a simple basic CSS change or vanilla JavaScript change they couldn't do it and I that was really interesting to me because I haven't had that experience I came up through doing just normal CSS and JavaScript before I started with react and different frameworks so but they were saying because of coding boot camps there are a lot of people a lot of developers now that are coming through the coding boot camps they focus on the frameworks like react or angular and you learn that and to save time because they need to get in so much material they skip over a lot of the basics you know why learn CSS if you could just use bootstrap right or some component library so anyway I thought that was interesting so maybe I'll try to occasionally throw in some basic CSS stuff like this because evidently there's some there's some need for it in some cases let's see okay I'm bear to saying the image looks very gloomy are you talking about this image in the background I think at that point in the stream we were talking about this image so potentially yeah actually this image is the default stock photo that came with this this application so we we hired a thirdparty company that's not Salesforce but they developed this for Salesforce and this is their default thing so I don't even know what school this is but we're definitely gonna if we keep an image we are going to take that out actually I just made up my mind we're not gonna have an image in it first if people higher up than me tell me I need to put an image back in I will but we're gonna save so much time by not having to go through images and pick what image we want for this and then edit the image okay so let's just let's just do that and then of course I would want to have responsive images so I would want multiple crops and sizes so that's we're gonna save a lot of time no no oh man almost locked me out okay oh cool so Michael Creole says my first time watching you live awesome thank you for joining us hopefully you're still joining us I know you sent that message a while ago about a half hour ago yeah but that's awesome I'm so glad that you could you could join us live and thanks for letting me know so feel free to send me any comments or questions that you have and I'd love to hear more from you Harshit says I guess Salesforce is the company who made Heroku oh really I did not remember that that's cool yeah Salesforce is a really big company they just either built or bought one of the biggest buildings in San Francisco for their headquarters so they're quite quite a successful company right now a harsh it says the editor looks like notepad plus plus yeah does it definitely looks like notepad plus plus I was not in a hurry to use that that builtin editor okay I see something about font size let me increase that font size again oh maybe we'll have to extend this a little bit all right maybe right there we'll be all right Oh Michael says here in the woods of Mississippi I'm struggling to get 360 probably not your fault oh man I'm sorry that must be really hard to see everything I'll do my best to describe everything because I it's probably tough to see it on 360 we'll talk about video quality so anyway Michael uh awesome you're from Mississippi I don't recall anyone ever on the stream saying that they're from Mississippi so you might be the first person well harsh it's in the Himalayas I'm not sure if I had anybody say they're in the Himalayas before so that's that's cool all right so my timer is up I'm gonna grab a pen and write down where I'm going to leave off here in the live chat so I can find it more quickly later on and let's do another 25minute coding session and the first thing that we're going to do first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna grab this code and that we just did so all this and we're gonna put it in and see if it works I definitely want to test it periodically because I'm not sure if this is enough to override the styles that are in there right now sometimes you never know what gets injected into the page in line that could be overriding thing so now's a great time since we've finished this one component here I think now's a great time to check that out we don't want to forget though there is this dropdown menu so oh great okay I was worried that it would it would mess up a lot when we changed our Styles you know what I think this is fine the only thing that I'm gonna change about this is I don't want I want this to not have a background and I want this icon to be green let's go ahead and change that now and then we'll check it we'll check out the code so icon bar okay so the for the icon bar or default never tell you icon bar all right let's change this to 2a oh goodness this is how they did it oops that's not what I wanted I'd wait a second hold on this is so interesting okay bordercolor all right let's get rid of that border so no border color none will that work no we're gonna have to go transparent okay so let's let's throw this in here now so we're gonna have several elements they're gonna have to edit so let's go with bordercolortransparent for that navbar and then this is taller navigation that's for the screen reader so see this is s our only screen reader only and then it has text so that a screen reader when it gets to this we'll say it's the toggle navigation so that's useful for people who can't see or have trouble seeing and it's it's a good it's always good to think about that when you're developing so I think it's something that is really easy to forget but it's so important for people with disabilities to be able to have access to the site it may not seem like a big deal but to that person it's a huge deal all right so did that actually show up as green now it did yeah it was just a bit hard to see I want to doublecheck what we're using on our other sites in terms of borderradius for these so let's let's quickly go to let's go to the resource center and let's check this out it's not let me zoom why not now that's weird there we go my trackpad has been acting a bit weird okay so it looks like there's no borderradius on those so let's change that up I'm gonna leave this open so we can reference it more quickly whoops there we go okay so now back to here let's change our border radius to zero there we go now we have the look that we want great so let's take this just grab this and we're gonna grab this one so anyway if I sounded somewhat amazed when I first looked at this and that was because I realized that this is not a font icon or an SVG this is in fact three spans that just have a background color but yeah that's so interesting and actually you could do quite a lot with this since it's three spans I mean you could use some CSS animations to do some really cool animation things I've seen cool things done with these before so we're not going to do anything like that right now but it's just kind of cool to see it done like that I've seen it before but I never do it like this so it's just is kind of interesting to see how other people do that and okay I didn't copy that yet okay and we can remove these because we don't really want to change that all right now I think it's time to test this out so let's copy everything that we have here and let me let's paste it in so let's find a good spot here in the head to put in oops you know what I forgot that's not how our flow is going to go it's good too have a good workflow so things don't get messed up so I have a lot of experience with having to work with old systems or within these other systems and so you kind of have to just improvise a workflow since you can't have it ideally the way you want so here's the workflow what the workflow is going to be we're always going to edit this file first and then copy and paste everything over that way we can have a copy locally and actually I'm going to need let's just save this now in our projects under Salesforce so let's call this app template dot HTML great now let's create a style tag and then we can paste in all our Styles now we'll copy everything over and paste it all in this will it's it might seem kind of weird to do this now but if we start editing multiple places in here and going back in and trying to edit things it's going to get difficult it's much easier to just every single time we do something completely replace everything then trying to scroll through and find the exact spot where we need to edit things so in the long run the feedback loop is going to be much shorter if we just do it like this controls ctrl a ctrl c ctrl V is really fast to do I'm sorry I'm on a Mac its command so anyway so let's do save I recommend quick save if you're working in Salesforce save will take you back to the original page and then you have to hit edit again and go back in click save let you stay on this page so let's do a refresh and see how much of what we've done what we've done is actually gonna work okay not too bad it looks like our colors are good the border is good I I can see the shadow great obviously the logo the color here is I believe that's a green it is but we do have an issue with with this though showing up so that's one thing we'll have to override and let's check this out oops we have a hover I had never took away the hover effect so we want to get rid of that okay so let's let's do that so two things we need to do get rid of these guys and then get rid of that hover effect so let me do the hover first so I don't forget because the icons are a lot more obvious so let's inspect that and what we're gonna do so this is the the element that we're going to be working with we can go in here and dev tools and click on hover and then click the box for hover and so now we don't have to move our mouse over this it's going to be permanently hovered until we uncheck this and now we can see the hover styles so let's grab let's just let's grab all of this and but set transparent as the background color right normally we wouldn't be setting transparent as a background color that's ridiculous right but remember we're not going to directly edit this file so we have to think how can we override everything so actually let me see by default ever see where I want to put this thing I'm gonna put it here yeah that makes sense we're going to have to give a little bit of thought to our net organization of our code and actually I messed up on my um on my workflow here it should have gone here first I guess it doesn't matter we could do it either way it might save us a step if we just did it all here but I wouldn't kind of like to have a separate copy okay so you have that here say that there and so that should be taken care of and then finally let's go in here and inspect this and make sure it should be this before you know what maybe we edited the wrong thing let's take a look at this again hmm that's interesting oops I think we we went to the wrong before so well yeah we just need to edit our CSS so let's go ahead and do that I'm not even gonna test it in dev tools because I target header user okay because I am 99% sure that this will work just like this we'll just amend this here all right now let's let's give it another test before we move on quick save this kind of thing really makes you appreciate live reloading great okay so that works now No okay we've done something wrong here let's double check what we had here in our code whoops this is the problem his parents okay great now that that does work awesome you know what I think we have a hover effect right here on this text I can barely see it good let's see probably on this span let's check out the hover on the span no let's check out the hover here yep there we go okay so on this this a tag we have a hover effect where the color changes yeah I mean that's not a huge deal you can barely tell but I'll I'll see it so let me change that okay this will be an easy change just without we're going to do that we're just going to go a to a target etc user we're going to add this on here area and that should work okay I'm not even gonna test that that's that's definitely gonna work okay awesome so we've got a totally redesigned header I don't want to say totally I mean it we didn't do that much here right and we just remove some things but now this already just because we did the header I think this already looks like a Franciscan University website according to the the updated styles that we've been using so awesome awesome that looks a million times better than then would it look like an hour ago sorry that sounded like I was I was bragging on there I'm just I'm not I didn't mean for it to come out like that I'm just happy that this all worked out and it I'm happy with the way it looks right now all right so let me check out the time eight minutes okay let's see just see what we'll do nice let's just take this image out of here you know what I'm gonna see if I can find the actual element where this image is because here's what I don't want to happen I don't want us we could test this out for sure but what I'm afraid might happen is that this image would somehow get loaded anyway if we just try to override it so let's see what what this image is yeah it's probably it's a background image so yeah I don't want it to accidentally get loaded next word hero so if we can find this let's just try to remove it target X dashboard here oh I have a feeling that we're not gonna find it in the file but it's worth a shot so let's go back to our template file and find target X dashboard here whoa did you really find it crazy all right oops let me make this bigger sorry I am I don't know why I forgot to make this bigger all right so let's see wow we do have this here amazing target X 4 hero all right so let's see what we can move you know what I want to remove this entire thing there's no reason why we need Franciscan University student will here when we have it right here we have the logo here it's entirely redundant and unnecessary let's just get rid of this entire section they're calling a hero section here and then we don't have to worry about trying to fit our logo into here this is going to save us a lot of time and I don't think that we're really gonna lose very much aesthetically by getting rid of this section and it's definitely gonna be worth it for the amount of time we'll save so let's for now I'm just gonna comment these out I do have a backup of this so we can mess it up as much as we want and I have backups but for now I think it's which it's still better if we just comment it out and then it'll make it that much easier to bring it back if somebody sees that and freaks out and wants it back so insert hero alright so I'm hoping that I don't get an error by taking things out but let's let's find out I know when we were working with csharp and we try to take some of the stuff out we got an error and we had to do some other stuff but this should be fun I was afraid that would happen shoot you know I'm just gonna take this out and user use your name shoot hold on a second I want to see what this is and if this is going to be important at some point yeah okay I think I do want to keep this this little user that's kind of a nice thing a nice personalized thing it was commented out though and I don't know if they just it was in there just for a demo of what it could do you know what let's log in and see what this really does on the interior pages so we're gonna need to sign up so it's great I bet I get admissions pamphlets and stuff mailed to me not maybe if I use my Franciscan do you address somebody in admissions will realize that like I have a user already all right fine then let's use a different email just a while Jima it actually wouldn't be a bad idea for me to get these mailings I'd like to see and then that way if there's any UI issues with the emails that they send out to prospective students I'll be able to see them where's my email okay well so the email that gets sent out check that out so that could definitely use some work I don't know how much control we have over that but there's a few things obviously it's not aesthetically pleasing at all I'm not the best at making emails but so I'm not really shouldn't be talking about this but that could use some improvement and look at the email the from email JRM team dot franciscan so this is not it should not be that it shouldn't be JRM team at Frances the Franciscan agenda board calm all right well I don't think I can change that right now off there just deal with it later on all right so I'm going to create a password on my other screen okay so I was making sure that I added all of that it's the last pass I don't forget it so let's let's login whoa interesting all right so we're dealing with and this is using angular for this this looks like angular they are okay so the once you login it's using angular ok so I guess we're gonna have to do a whole different set of styles for all the interior pages alright well good to know you're not gonna get to it today but definitely need some work okay so that's taking a lot longer than I would expect all right so my 25 minute timer is up and yeah it's definitely up so I'm gonna go back to the live chat I'm gonna go through all the questions now and then trying to think if there is something now for some reason I thought there was something I want something else I wanted to do but now I can't think of it so I'm just going to go over the questions in the live chat so pick up where we left off after the last break so we're done with the coding portion of it which is good because I can't get this page to refresh now anyway but really nice definitely I for sure wanted to get the header finished today and we accomplished that we actually got a little bit farther and started checking out the code for that hero section so it was a good day and hopefully you all got something out of that just for some CSS stuff I um wasn't quite as interactive as normal mostly because I hey I don't need as much help with the CSS alright so let me find out where I left off okay so the all right I can't pronounce his PA t vq i'm just gonna say the pat so the pat says hello i want to build a simple portfolio blog site so i can update my progress so make posts in learning coding do you know any tutorial with Django or nodejs blog creation yeah there's a there's a lot of different tutorials that you could go to I guess it kind of depends on how complicated you want to make it if if you want to do this project of a blog as a learning experience then you could try to make one from scratch using node or Django or whatever you want if the goal is just to get a blog up and running as fast as possible so you can you know start posting things then you could just run a wordpress blog very simply they have the five minute install which I mean literally it is five minutes or less so that would be the simplest thing to do but if you wanted to get a little bit more complex you could use what's it called is it Jekyll is that is that the like the static site kind of creator that a lot of people use for blogging there's something else too it's a ghost I can't remember all the names of it but yeah you can definitely you can get a blog up and running you know in less than an hour if you just do a simple WordPress blog or you can be more common if you wanted to get really complex and just work on your skills you could check out what we've done with the WordPress API and react and nodejs in our previous streams of project one project and project four were all in slightly different ways basically building sites that have blog functionality even though we're not calling them blogs with WordPress node and react so depending on how complicated you want to get there's a lot of options out there for you Harshit says check traverse see media so I've never looked anything from Travis II but I have seen that recommended before so check that out Harris asked how well does free code can't prepare you for that's weird did that just take me to the main page the homepage it did that since that's not good oh shoot and that's not even what I wanted that's really weird actually let me take this out now before somebody sees this because I know this is probably a just a demo user but I doubt that they would want that let me remove that and this you just take the Sun okay there we go never this looks like one of my sites now right lots of white very plain the point is a site like this will load so fast right and users know what's gonna happen so they know what they're supposed to do anyway we'll clean this up tomorrow or some other Sun all right so it's re harris i am i got sidetracked so the question was how well does free code can't prepare you for salesforce development i learning the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript will prepare you well for any kind of web development but in particular Salesforce development has a lot of things that are unique to Salesforce so any course that's not specifically Salesforce is not going to fully prepare you for it but you just see now we're making modifications to a Salesforce visualforce page and we're able to use so far basic HTML CSS so that base will be able to it will help you to to do a lot and then you can just pick up some of the the more platform specific things later on so the answer is is I guess not fully so free code kind of will not fully prepare you to develop for Salesforce but it's going to give you the necessary basic information to be able to then build on and learn some of those Salesforce specific things so says rook says the screensaver behind you is mesmerizing do I have a screensaver me and I maybe it was on I didn't even notice let me see I didn't realize you could see that oh oh I guess you can't see that screen this is a really old Windows laptop that I have an external monitor hooked up to and I never use it it doesn't even have an internet connection I used to use it for testing but I just can't stand it it's too slow I don't have patience to deal with that old slow computers Blake says I didn't catch what Salesforce's can you react splain it rooks rook recommended rewinding the livestream to see it I'll give you a very short explanation though in case you didn't do that or if anybody else is interested Salesforce is a platform that's mainly used by businesses to track customers or potential customers or clients get them in a sales funnel and track them along the progress of being a potential customer you know actually being you know paying customer and then doing remarketing and things like that so it Salesforce can do a ton of stuff but I think basically that's the main goal of how a lot of people use sales was in our case for my university we're using this to help us organize the process that we go through to attract potential students and to have them you know actually go through the process of enrolling and coming to our University okay Harshit says I guess it's pas a platform as a service yeah yeah yes I think that would be accurate okay michael says regarding adam what packages are you using uhhuh a lot of faxes let me bring up let me show you my config yeah I'm just gonna scroll slowly through my packages I don't know this isn't gonna give it all is it shoot let me go to this you then I forget what the file is that shows all your packages so I'll zoom in oh I can't I was thinking I could save I'm just gonna scroll through these slowly so that you can check them out and then if you need to you can pause the video or rewind it later on okay so into my packages okay cool so some of you are saying where are you from so Tennessee so let me see so Dione is that let me know if I'm pronouncing that wrong D IO and any so I'm I'm thinking it's Dione but correct me please if I'm wrong from Tennessee so that's cool you're from Tennessee I'm going to be in Tennessee speaking at a conference at the end of November so November 28th and 29th I don't know what day I'm speaking yet but I'll be in Nashville so if you're gonna be around Nashville and can go to a conference check it out it's called November the tickets are still on sale it's going to be on the on a campus at Vanderbilt University so anyway check it out if you can and I'll be there and if you're there come and say hi to me also if you have any recommendations for what I should do when I am in Nashville please let me know if anybody has some natural recommendations cool Blake's from South Carolina cool I like I love Charleston South Carolina that's one of my favorite cities it's just I've I've rarely ever seen a city so beautiful as Charleston and the food there oh it's just amazing if you like seafood Charleston is the place to go let's see haha Michael said that that email that I showed earlier looked like a phishing email yeah it does that's a good point actually if I say that I think I'll definitely get the access or get that changed if I bring up the fact that it looks like phishing email so I'm really glad you said that Peter asks if I've ever played bf1942 so battlefield 1942 I have not is it good should I play it but let me is it a firstperson shooter because if it is I can't play it I get really emotional a firstperson shooters I can't handle it I used to take Dramamine which is a it's a pill that you can take that makes you it relieves motion sickness symptoms but it also makes you really tired so I used to take Dramamine at night play Call of Duty I'd play with my dad and then play until I was too tired and just fall asleep otherwise I'd be so sick michael says if you've got to fix that it might be time to ask for a raise actually I did I went to go make a joke to my boss earlier but he wasn't in his office but I was going to say hey now that I officially graduated from the Udacity react nano degree program I think it's time that I get paid more money I know that's not gonna happen right now but I just wanted to mess with him well maybe I'll check and see if he's here after know the strength okay cool allit Alessandra Alessandra or Alessandra let me know which way to pronounce it I don't want to mess it up says Gatsby J s that's I think that's what I was trying to think of Gatsby so that's for the I'm sorry I this for the blogging thing earlier we're talking about an easy way to get started blogging check out Gatsby jazz used it yet but I've heard really good things about it like at conferences and things so I I recommend it in the sense that I've I've heard that it's good okay cool Dion thanks for the the help with the pronunciation so it's Dion rhymes with neon awesome that's a great way to remember it so Dion says what skills are technologies do you consider to be intermediate frontend there are no junior level jobs in my area and a recruiter suggests that I apply for midlevel roles yeah definitely when it comes to applying for jobs do not be intimidated when you're trying when the Job Description seems like it's beyond which you can currently do apply anyway sometimes those job descriptions are written by people and Human Resources who are good at what they do but they have no idea what these coding terms mean so they'll go into the IT department or whatever department that's hiring a coder and say what do you need that coder to be able to do and they'll list a bunch of things that they'd like the person to do and then the HR person just puts them all down on a list not realizing that this kind of seems ridiculous to have somebody with all these different skills or I've dealt with that process of trying to make a job description that would make sense to a coder even though it didn't make sense to the HR people so anyway you never know what's going on behind the scenes with that so number one this isn't exactly a question but number one go for those jobs even if you don't think you have the skills yet also when it comes to intermediate frontend skills this is really it's kind of hard to it's hard to say for sure where that line between beginner and intermediate and then intermediate and expert is so I it's not like we could really give an exact you know place but I would say if you are to the point where and like I said this is entirely my opinion because I don't know that there's any for sure standard of what's intermediate but to me is someone claim that they were an intermediate level developer and were supplying for a job to work here I would want to see preferably on github I would want to see that they've been able to take a project completely build out the project connect to api's pull in data work with forms form validation handling form data I would want to see that they're able to use javascript techniques beyond just jQuery so whether that be some sort of framework like react angular paraview or others or whether that be they're using vanilla JavaScript or whatever but I want to see their beyond that I'd like also to see depending on the job it would be nice to see some custom CSS work so that they're going beyond just a normal framework the frameworks are really nice and I recommend using them whenever you can but it's nice to know that someone can adapt it as necessary so those are the skills that I would be looking for just in general it's hard to say you know because so much depends on specifically the the job and what needs to be done but but the big things are they can do things from scratch with the that makes sense or adaptive framework they can do more than just basic jQuery and actually do some more advanced JavaScript things that can potentially mean being able to handle using a framework and if it's like reacting a frame where they can manage state properly and then can they interact with api's can they pull data make sure that you know make sure that their sites are checking you go they're checkin these they're validating their form inputs are they checking to make sure that when you know data comes and when it's not when it's not there are they providing fall backs like you know error messages like things that things that separate the work from being like just a project that you're doing and being something that is actually deployable live and is reliable anyway so that was probably kind of vague I'm sorry if it if it was too vague for you but hopefully that that helps a little bit but in general my advice for that kind of thing is just keep working and keep pushing yourself and doing projects and keep applying you just you never know what's really going on and when a job description is created so it's worth a shot to applied it to anything that you're even remotely interested in okay Blake said did you see my question on Ajax I did not let me scroll up okay I'm sorry Blake I don't know how I missed that Blake's question is I'm sending data to a Google sheet using Ajax and in two of my fields I get undefined docs.google.com spreadsheet oh okay I checked all my name attributes code is like two on this up state all right let me check I actually have your your github open right now on another in another window so it's github upstate okay so this is assuming it's in contact je s yeah that's for your sending a Google sheet okay I'll check that out after the shingon all the time it is yeah if I have time today I'll check it out after the stream otherwise maybe I'll check it out tomorrow and I'll let you know maybe I'll just submit a pull request I don't know we'll see anyway I see it now sorry I missed that before Blake I've worked with sending form data to Google sheets before so hopefully I'll be able to sort it out now I won't be able to see what code you have going on on your Google sheet in Google Apps Script so if the problem is on that side of things obviously I can't do it and I won't be able to fully test it out so if it's something obvious that I can see I can help with otherwise I probably won't be able to help I can always maybe try to make my own she will see how much time I have okay Deon says darn I have to work is it livestreamed actually I I don't think it's gonna be livestreamed we actually add so on Twitter there was a conversation back and forth between the people that are running the conference and somebody from the livestream who was it I can't remember now who it was about live streaming stuff from the conference from November and it didn't seem like it was going to happen that it would be live streamed so probably won't get live streamed if the Internet's good enough I might try to shoot some footage if I'm allowed in either live stream it or upload it to YouTube it's going to place it'll depend on the quality of the internet there so I'll try to put out some content no matter what I know the keynote talks are going to be put on YouTube I don't think they'll be live streamed so I may or may not my talk may or may not be on YouTube so we'll see how cool Blake says it's nice so we when I was talking about Charleston South Carolina Blake says it's nice I live in Greenville it's probably the second nicest cool I've never been to Greenville maybe I've five a chance off to check out Greenville to okay Deon says thanks for your input to my question you're welcome they said hopefully that that had helped let me know if you have any followup questions or anything either in the stream or you can send me a message on Twitter or whatever social media be more than happy that answer any questions you have especially if it's something more specific sometimes people prefer to ask more specific questions over you know Twitter or something like in a direct message so I'm I'm up for that too sometimes if I'm really busy I can't always get back to you right away but I'll try with it to get back to you within a couple of days okay Blake saying asking if I want the Google script yeah actually if you could send me the the Google script then that would be helpful because then I could make my own and and test it Harris says what's your schedule like how do you balance we're teaching plus keep on learning more so I'm actually not teaching so my work here is I'm a fulltime frontend developer so my workday is it's supposed to be an eighthour workday but that includes one hour for lunch sometimes my hours are weird and it doesn't work out like that but in general that's pretty much my schedule of work I usually work on Saturdays on on learning more so if I have a class or a client on the side I do that work on Saturdays sometimes I do it before I come to work and on my lunch breaks occasionally I work at night during the week so I don't really have a consistent schedule for that other than Saturdays so I don't like to always work on Saturdays because I do want to spend time with with my family and I for four kids eight years old and under so I'll probably be taking a break from working on Saturdays now for for a while I'm I don't know we'll see unless something comes up like a project or client i I don't maybe I'll take a break until till after the new year he's I've been pretty busy since basically this whole year with side projects so that's kind of how I managed to learn more with the teaching thing I'm I was actually hoping to be able to teach a little bit in the computer science department this semester but things kind of fell through with I was planning on doing some sort of team teaching thing but the schedule of the teacher that I was team teaching with things are a little weird it didn't work out so I'm hoping that maybe next year it'll happen I don't know that I would want to teach an entire course all by myself and deal with paperwork and all that stuff but if I could team teach and just come in and teach certain topics and not how to worry about all the other stuff the administrative tasks that come along with teaching I definitely be up for that there's a web development course here in the computer science department that I would love to get in there and you know teach some of the newer techniques for web development but for now I like doing what I'm doing so I don't really have like a burning desire to teach I used to teach high school and it was nice but I'm not I love what I'm doing right now so if it happens and I get to teach that'll be cool because I'd really like to help out the students here and help them to get some good experience on projects but I'm not actively pursuing that if it happens it happens and if in terms of the balance the balance is hard so I don't always feel like I have a balance between work and and learning and my family so it's just something you kind of just strive for every day and if you mess up with it and you get out of balance you try to do better but it's just it's hard especially with kids you can't always plan everything out you know things happen a kid gets sick and you got to stay up all night with them or you know that that throws off your schedule so you just can't it's just hard to have like a set schedule and plan things when you have all those those unknown variables with with the kids that demand attention you can't just tell the kid wait you know and I'll get to it especially when you have babies like they depend on you for everything so you got to be there so I don't think there's one like clear answer to getting that perfect worklife balance you just got to be ready to adapt you know and then realize that sometimes you'll go through periods where you're able to do a lot one way or the other you may not be able to have a perfect balance every day so that you do these certain things you know depends on your situation Michael asked do you think freelance sites like up work are worth worth it to try out I'm not that familiar with up work let me look I haven't had great results with freelance sites okay upwork looks a lot like top towel and I I haven't worked for top towel but the concept looks the same and I actually like the concept so the concept is more like this up work or top towel is the middleman and they try to pair you up with clients and they handle all the contracts paperwork payments all that stuff and you just get to do the work I'm actually a big fan of that setup although like I said I haven't worked for them for any you big company like that so can't say about a personal experience but I like that the sites that I don't like and I don't think are worth it or the sites where I think one sites called freelancer freelancer yet is where you go on there and it just seems like people are doing work for for nothing you know they're trying to outbid each other undercut the prices it did it just doesn't seem worth it unless you have nowhere else to go and you really need to build up your portfolio people just aren't being paid what they should be what they're worth so then anyway that's my opinion on it like I said I don't have a ton of personal experience with all the different kinds of sites that do that that sort of thing so as long as if the sites encouraging developers to undercut each other in price I'd say stay away from it if instead the site is actually helping developers get paid what they should get paid and making it easier for them to find clients then great I'm all for that so just check out check out the site and see if you can get ahold of people or talk to people that that are actually working with that company and see what they think now Luke says the screensaver is back okay I see it now I can see it in my that is kind of cool I never see it because it's always behind me Harris says here's an idea freakout cam should provide productivity tips in videos or vlog format yeah that would actually be pretty cool I'd have to think about it I could probably do something I certainly have complete freedom to post videos on my own YouTube channel I have to probably run it by Quincy if I wanted to do a different style of video but he'd probably be okay with it as long as I came up with topics and the quality was good so you think about that and there probably other people that can do it you have much better quality videos than me and have better you know better topics a better opinion so yeah but that's a good idea I'll keep that in mind yeah let me know what kind of things you you all would like to hear about and I can either work it in the live stream or try to do videos and put it on my youtube channel I'm I'm open to suggestions my screensaver is is keeping everybody's attention now there we go you want me to block try to block it out I guess I can it's still there let's see okay sorry I Harris says oh by teaching I meant these live streams ok sorry that makes so much more sense now I just I never think about this as teaching it's because I it's it's way more collaborative than normal teaching so that makes a lot of sense that sorry I misunderstood so Harris says I meant by a teaching I meant these live streams I had a professor who ended up teaching half the semester through a youtube live that's really cool I would that I would like to do it like that not have to actually go into the classroom and just I think it would be easier because if I'm teaching like I want to I'm teaching code stuff the most important thing is that people can see my screen see what's on it so it would almost be better if I just live stream then all the students could have the code right there on their computers anyway okay yeah so the good actually there is one way there's one key reason why I'm able to do these streams and stream as frequently and as long as I do and that is because I get to stream while I'm at work so that's why I work on the projects that I need to for my job and so in that sense I can't always work on what I really want to but it's fine I think we still do good good projects and because I can do it at work it doesn't cut into my time that I would have with my family so it would be hard for me to be able to spend this much time if it was taking time away my family especially since I'm volunteering you know it'd be hard to explain to my wife that hey can you watch the kids for another like three hours every day so that I could do this and we're not getting any more money so you could see how that would be a hard sell so thankfully my boss sees real value and what I'm doing in terms of several reasons one the University's name gets out there to a lot of places that no one probably was never heard of this University before which is good also I learned so much from you all you can to contribute to project so these projects end up being so much better than they ever would be if it was just me doing it so essentially my boss is giving this time away by letting me work on it for free code camp and in return though the university is is gaining you know some publicity and gaining some expertise from you all so I think it's a it's a very nice kind of tradeoff there so hopefully I can continue to do this and it still is beneficial for for you all for free code camp and for the University and everything can keep working out like this all right Rick asks what is the most effective objectoriented programming language to learn in a short timeframe to land an entry job any suggestions I don't have that much experience with other programming languages but honestly the easiest language for me to learn out of all the other ones that I did that I worked on I don't know let me think about that for a second probably Python yeah Python so just to give some context I have worked with C++ C sharp PHP Java and Python and some of that was just doing basic tutorials but Python did seem to be the easiest for me to pick up so Python right now is really big with machine learning and stuff like that so if you're interested in that field then I would check it out also Python is cool because it's one of the few programming languages that it's really doable to code on a phone because it's more about indentation and less about special characters which usually take several clicks to get to on a phone so I actually learned Python on my iPhone and by learned I mean like learned enough to do really basic stuff I'm not at all an expert on Python world says do all frameworks use Ajax under the hood no I don't they don't all use Ajax and like I don't want to get into obaid over what's the difference between a framework and a library because we've we've had that before but using like the loose definition of those things if you would want to consider react in that general category of framework which I know we've had debates before and it's probably better called a library but anyway someone like that doesn't actually use anything so you're free to use whatever you want so you could use Ajax you could do just basic xhr you could use fetch what's the other one that people always like I can't remember there's some other way to do it no it's totally slipping my mind I always have suggestions from people to use it but anyway it doesn't actually come builtin so I guess the answer would be no not necessarily okay I've gotten to the end of the live chat I was just doublechecking to make sure I didn't miss anything if I did miss something really sorry you can ask it again in tomarrow stream or send me a message on some social media network let's see alright that's it for today I should be back tomorrow I don't think I have anything going on so it should be around the normal time somewhere around 200 p.m. Eastern Time I will be back we're probably going to be working on this this app some more this has been a project that I've had since May and I keep putting it off because it didn't need to be done so finally I just want to get it done so that when I finally get asked if I did this which nobody's asked me about it which is another reason why I haven't done it when I finally get asked if I did it I can just say hey check it out and it'll be done and and everyone will be impressed so it'll be this for a little while until we get it done I don't think it'll take that long hopefully not so anyway I'll see you all tomorrow until then have a great day
