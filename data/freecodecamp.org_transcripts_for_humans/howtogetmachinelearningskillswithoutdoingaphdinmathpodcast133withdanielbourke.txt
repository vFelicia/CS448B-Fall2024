00:00 - programming to me is just thinking like
00:02 - a lot of my time I think if if people
00:04 - get the um the idea of like if you're a
00:07 - software engineer you just spend all day
00:09 - um writing code I would say now majority
00:14 - like I do write a lot of code however uh
00:18 - I use AI tools such as GitHub co-pilot
00:20 - to write a lot of the boiler plate
00:25 - [Music]
00:47 - welcome back to the freec code Camp
00:50 - podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and
00:53 - founder of freec camp.org each week
00:55 - we're bringing you Insight from
00:56 - developers Founders and ambitious people
00:59 - getting into Tex
01:00 - this week we're joined by Daniel Burke
01:04 - Daniel is a machine learning engineer
01:06 - he's the creator of many popular
01:08 - tutorials on YouTube and he's a frequent
01:11 - contributor to the Freo Camp YouTube
01:13 - channel Daniel welcome to the
01:16 - podcast hey Quincy it's it's great to be
01:19 - here uh I actually started to learn to
01:21 - code back in the day I think it was
01:22 - about 2017 on free code Camp um I
01:26 - remember going through all the projects
01:27 - and so yeah it's really cool to be here
01:30 - absolutely man it's great to have you
01:32 - here and I just want to emphasize that
01:34 - uh it's an honor to count among our
01:37 - alumni somebody like yourself who not
01:39 - only goes out and practices like kind of
01:42 - Leading Edge uh machine learning
01:44 - techniques but also turns around and
01:46 - teaches other people how to do that
01:48 - that's super chill and I also want to
01:51 - acknowledge that uh a couple years ago
01:54 - you you made a you had a pretty good
01:55 - year on YouTube and you turned around
01:57 - and you donated the proceeds from your
02:00 - YouTube channel to freeo Camp uh to our
02:02 - charity and that was super kind of you
02:06 - and that helped uh that went toward
02:08 - teacher compensation that went toward
02:10 - keeping the 100 servers we have around
02:12 - the world up and running and uh so I
02:15 - just want to publicly thank you for
02:17 - doing
02:18 - that it was my pleasure I've gained a
02:20 - lot from free code Camp so yeah it was
02:23 - uh very very heartwarming for me to be
02:25 - able to give back in some way yeah well
02:28 - let's dive in and learn more about you
02:31 - man like I have really enjoyed watching
02:33 - your videos over the past few years and
02:35 - uh to be completely candid I still don't
02:37 - know that much about your personal life
02:40 - I know how like Ironclad your work ethic
02:43 - is and how you have all these different
02:45 - techniques to be incredibly productive
02:47 - which you you know delve into on your
02:50 - channel but you're based over there in
02:53 - brisban in Australia I hope I'm
02:55 - pronouncing it correctly Brisbane how do
02:57 - you pronounce it uh bris Brisbane so
02:59 - like bris bin okay so it's almost like
03:02 - there's no e on the end like bris bin
03:05 - yeah yeah but Bane is yeah it kind of
03:08 - looks like Bane
03:11 - bris well it's like I I always would
03:13 - pronounce Melbourne and when I went to
03:16 - Melbourne people were like oh it's
03:18 - Melbourne like it's very Australia we
03:20 - like to compress the vows as much as
03:23 - possible yeah yeah that's awesome well I
03:26 - mean Americans we do the same thing
03:27 - right like we have like these words like
03:30 - these French words that we inherited and
03:32 - we just chop them down to like it'll be
03:34 - like seven letters and it'll be like one
03:35 - syllable right so um yeah well let's
03:39 - talk about your childhood out there cuz
03:41 - it sounds like you had a pretty idelic
03:43 - childhood I understand that you live
03:45 - pretty close to where you grew up I do
03:48 - yeah so my uh family home is about a
03:50 - kilometer down the road uh the house I
03:52 - live in now I live in with uh my second
03:55 - brother I have three younger brothers so
03:57 - there's four boys in our family and uh
04:01 - yeah my other two brothers live a
04:02 - kilometer down the street with both my
04:04 - parents and we really love the area um
04:07 - so back a few years ago I was thinking
04:10 - about moving to the US but then that
04:12 - that just didn't happen cuz I found a
04:14 - job in Australia and I'm like you know
04:16 - what the internet's good enough I'm just
04:17 - going to stay here cuz yeah I love it we
04:20 - live really close to uh the sandate
04:22 - foreshore or Waterfront which if you
04:24 - look on Google Maps just a beautiful
04:26 - area the three biggest sand islands are
04:28 - actually just just off the east coast of
04:31 - Australia so we live opposite um three
04:33 - biggest sand islands in the world that
04:35 - is we live opposite Morton Island which
04:37 - is the third biggest sand Island it's a
04:39 - beautiful place we go there for family
04:41 - holidays um every year so um I turned 30
04:45 - last year what is a sand island is it
04:47 - like a sand bar like literally just sand
04:49 - there's no so imagine just a huge Sand
04:51 - Bar yeah so it's like just pure sand um
04:56 - yeah I mean there is some dirt but it's
04:58 - like most majority sand so if you like
05:00 - dig dig underneath the the grass and
05:03 - whatnot that's sort of made its way
05:04 - there over time through wind and water
05:07 - um you'll just start digging into sand
05:10 - um but yeah it's a huge Sandbar like
05:12 - we're talking I think one side of the
05:14 - island is like 25 km long so maybe 16 Mi
05:19 - or whatever the I'm not sure the the
05:21 - conversion there but it's um yeah it's a
05:24 - it's a great great place um and yeah we
05:27 - go there as that's been our family
05:28 - holiday since we were kids and it's
05:29 - about an hour boat ride offshore and uh
05:32 - you can take your full drive there and
05:34 - drive around all the sand tracks and go
05:36 - fishing and the water's nice and
05:38 - protected and uh and calm so it's almost
05:40 - like a big Harbor SL Lake uh so it's not
05:44 - where where I go for walks in the in the
05:46 - afternoon and evenings is is really
05:49 - really calm it's not like it's a beach
05:51 - but it's not like a a wach walking on
05:53 - like an ocean beach but there's not like
05:55 - a bunch of waves exactly yeah so it's
05:58 - more like a big uh like Lagoon SL
06:01 - Lake yeah that's that's how I would
06:04 - describe it that's really cool going
06:06 - you're not going surfing there how often
06:09 - yeah maybe maybe like kitty surfing like
06:11 - getting your kids ready for like seeing
06:13 - if they can stand on the board uh yeah
06:15 - like like how often do you actually go
06:17 - out to the beach and go for
06:19 - walks almost every day like I was out
06:21 - there yesterday went for a walk with my
06:23 - two young brothers and dogs and we were
06:26 - walking for I think an hour and a half
06:28 - or or so but it's yeah it's a beautiful
06:31 - I try to get out to see the water almost
06:32 - every day and we call it the scenic
06:34 - route when you drive home is like
06:35 - driving driving home we take the long
06:37 - way instead of like going straight to
06:39 - the house we drive drive along the
06:40 - Boulevard and just look out in the big
06:42 - expansive
06:44 - water yeah well Australia has a lot of
06:46 - big cities uh of course like you know
06:49 - Melbourne and uh uh Sydney and you know
06:53 - Brisbane uh like is that like a a major
06:57 - Tech Hub or is it like what is the
06:59 - popular what what is the industry like
07:01 - there well I would say definitely Sydney
07:05 - is the like the tech Hub or like just a
07:08 - business Hub in general and then
07:10 - Melbourne probably follows that as a
07:11 - close second and then brisbane's
07:13 - probably third after that um so if you
07:16 - like if I wanted to be really into it
07:19 - and definitely get a job in the industry
07:21 - I'd probably move to Sydney or Mourne um
07:25 - to work at a place but because of I mean
07:28 - the internet these days like brison's
07:30 - not that far behind and I I've been to
07:33 - Sydney to me that's that's like the New
07:35 - York of Australia it's too it's too
07:38 - hectic for me uh I I quite like to just
07:41 - chill out and uh not sit in traffic for
07:45 - hours at a time and uh Melbourne is
07:48 - beautiful like just a beautiful um
07:51 - conglomerate of different cultures
07:52 - there's almost many cities within a city
07:55 - in Melbourne that's how I perceive it
07:57 - and then Brisbane is kind of almost like
08:00 - I'm biased obviously but brisbane's like
08:02 - The Best of Both Worlds of Sydney and
08:03 - Melbourne so it's got that just enough
08:06 - busy but not too crazy but it's also got
08:09 - it's really starting to now um pop off
08:12 - pop off with with different little
08:14 - pockets of of culture and restaurants
08:16 - and that sort of stuff yeah that sounds
08:18 - really cool I mean that's like kind of
08:19 - the city like I like to live in like I
08:21 - like to live in a city but New York City
08:25 - Los Angeles like a little bit too big
08:28 - and being
08:31 - you know and I've seen like videos you
08:33 - just going out and ride bikes or like
08:35 - those like really bikes what tricle
08:38 - things I don't know what it is a big
08:40 - wheel we call a big wheel yeah yeah
08:44 - dries oh they yeah so they're epic
08:46 - they're like um yeah so little tricycles
08:49 - you you're sitting probably 2 to 3 Ines
08:51 - off the ground um in a bucket seat you
08:53 - got one big wheel on the front and uh
08:56 - then you have two rubber tires on the
08:57 - back and you make them into drift trikes
08:59 - by putting PVC pipe over the tires so
09:02 - there basically on the bitchman there's
09:04 - there's no no grip uh so you can you can
09:07 - move but then as soon as you try to turn
09:09 - your whole back end slides Out and
09:12 - because my family home is on a on a
09:14 - pretty steep hill and pretty long like
09:16 - it's a few hundred meters long um we
09:19 - we'd have we built these drift trikes
09:21 - and then we'd we'd ride down the side
09:23 - street to get speed turn left onto the
09:25 - hill and then just you could just skid
09:27 - out down the whole bottom of the hill
09:28 - you'd have someone down there looking
09:30 - out for when there's cars they give it
09:32 - all clear and then you just shoot down
09:36 - walk back up the hill start again so
09:39 - it's like Initial D for kids almost yeah
09:43 - Initial D you're familiar with the anime
09:44 - the drift racing kid no I have oh wait
09:47 - is that the one with the um that's the
09:49 - where the 86 is that the Toyota 86 yeah
09:53 - yeah okay I know it from the car cuz my
09:55 - friends are really into cars and uh they
09:57 - love their Toyota 86 and so I've kind of
10:00 - I've heard of it from there I went back
10:02 - and rewatched the first season it's
10:04 - pretty pretty exciting like uh yeah is
10:07 - it's cool it still holds up uh but yeah
10:09 - like like the like whenever I play like
10:12 - Mario Kart or something that's the thing
10:14 - I like to power slide right and so the
10:16 - notion that you could actually
10:17 - physically do that how dangerous like do
10:19 - you ever tip over yeah yeah like you'll
10:23 - you'll hit the like you got videos of us
10:25 - like you hit the gutter and you kind of
10:27 - cuz your front wheel's so big it um you
10:29 - hit the gutter and then it goes you like
10:31 - tip over the front cuz your uh um your
10:34 - front reel doesn't Mount The Gutter It
10:35 - just gets stuck like basically luckily
10:38 - there was no uh touchwood hectic
10:42 - accidents so minor crashes skin knees
10:46 - that sort of stuff but nothing too
10:48 - outlandish yeah but that sounds like so
10:50 - fun just like a nice physical activity
10:52 - go out and enjoy the outdoors it sounds
10:54 - like you're quite the Outdoorsman that
10:56 - you've optimized for spending a lot of
10:57 - time Outdoors through your lifestyle
11:00 - 100% yeah I like uh yeah I kind of love
11:04 - the balance between uh being sort of a
11:07 - monk in the mountains and just exploring
11:10 - and doing nothing most of the time and
11:12 - then uh being like a tech nerd and in
11:15 - front of screens all day and
11:16 - concentrating and Building Things and
11:18 - making stuff so it's a yeah I wouldn't
11:21 - say it's 50/50 but it's uh sometimes the
11:26 - one one side builds up too much and then
11:27 - I'm like okay I'm sick of relaxing and
11:29 - being in the mountains I need to go do
11:31 - some computer stuff and then vice versa
11:33 - it's like okay I'm sick of being in
11:35 - front of a computer I need to get
11:36 - outside yeah and and you can just toggle
11:39 - between the two like really easily you
11:40 - got the beach there you've got that Hill
11:43 - that you can you know drift race down
11:44 - well
11:46 - it's no you're so right like it's not
11:48 - far it's about the the uh where I live
11:51 - is probably as 10-minute walk to the to
11:54 - the beach front and so yeah and or bike
11:57 - ride like I go for one of the two to
11:59 - almost every day so it's a very uh yeah
12:01 - it's a very cool place yeah well I'm
12:04 - excited to learn a little bit about like
12:07 - you know they say that like people up in
12:09 - really cold brutal climates like like
12:12 - Russia or Scandinavia they become like
12:14 - the best Chess Masters cuz they're
12:15 - forced to they they have the best
12:17 - authors because they're like forced to
12:19 - stay in all the time and they can't go
12:21 - out and have fun in the sun and you know
12:24 - and yet you're in a very like it sounds
12:27 - like a great place to just relax and
12:29 - enjoy the outdoors and yet you are also
12:32 - very productive staying inside working
12:34 - on your laptop a lot maybe you could
12:36 - talk a little bit about that like how
12:37 - growing up what got you interested in
12:39 - technology when you've got like this
12:41 - great big Outdoors like Australia famous
12:44 - for being like very sparsely populated
12:47 - having this huge kind of Outback area
12:49 - that takes up most of the continent uh
12:51 - like I mean why didn't you end up like
12:55 - uh Steve Irwin for example why why are
12:57 - you why are you more like
12:59 - Yan laon or somebody like that
13:02 - right yeah maybe I'm I'm a crossover
13:04 - between Steve irn and Yan laon I kind of
13:07 - got similar hair to Steve um that's a
13:11 - that's a fantastic question I I
13:13 - basically got into computers as early as
13:17 - I can remember I mean my parents I
13:19 - remember them being at my grandparents
13:21 - house basically talking about the fact
13:23 - that um talking my mom was talking with
13:26 - my grandparents that she was going to
13:28 - buy a computer computer and I was just
13:30 - so interested I didn't actually know
13:31 - what it was and then um uh this is maybe
13:35 - when I was 5 six or seven and then she
13:38 - bought a computer for her business and
13:41 - or our family business that is and it
13:43 - was one of those old school ones like
13:46 - big gray plastic box like monitor was
13:49 - probably I mean if we looked at the size
13:50 - of that monitor these days it would be
13:52 - like people really looked at these for
13:54 - hours on there uh whereas now we're kind
13:57 - of blessed with 30in High defin
14:00 - screens but um yeah I was just
14:03 - fascinated with it and then you just
14:04 - sort of you get into that habit of just
14:06 - as a kid just playing around clicking
14:07 - things going through I remember going
14:09 - through because this is I think almost
14:11 - pre- internet or the internet was like
14:13 - dial up and so it it kind of sucked and
14:16 - then um but I remember just clicking
14:19 - through the menus just being like I can
14:21 - move this thing on the desk and it like
14:24 - relates to the screen I'm actually still
14:26 - fascinated by that whenever I cuz I
14:28 - haven't delved into like how computer
14:30 - hardware works at a really deep level um
14:33 - it still fascinates me that there's
14:34 - analog Parts in computers and like you
14:37 - press a key and it somehow triggers a
14:39 - current and then the letter Q appears on
14:42 - your screen anyway um got into that
14:45 - naturally started to find the internet
14:47 - naturally started to find online games
14:49 - and it just like just went from there my
14:51 - dad started to get uh he was a teacher
14:53 - at the high school I went to and then he
14:56 - started to laptops started to get
14:58 - introduced but he he never learned to
14:59 - use a computer he never learned to use a
15:01 - smartphone um and that's also like
15:04 - really fascinating to me is thinking
15:05 - about cuz now like my life is basically
15:08 - computers and screens but he's lived his
15:11 - whole life without basically without
15:14 - computers and screens so it's like
15:15 - really like fascinating to me like that
15:17 - J position and I feel like that's kind
15:19 - of influenced me a lot into um not just
15:24 - being 100% involved in screen time
15:29 - um but he got a laptop and basically
15:32 - yeah never never really learned to use
15:33 - it so my brothers would like hijack it
15:35 - cuz he'd bring it home from school and
15:36 - we'd get this laptop and because it was
15:39 - much newer than our um computer I
15:42 - remember when we got Wi-Fi at home um
15:45 - that was like early early days of Wi-Fi
15:49 - and I'm pretty sure I may be wrong here
15:50 - I'm fairly sure the the technology for
15:53 - Wi-Fi was invented in Australia may be
15:55 - wrong there but um when my friends would
15:59 - come over they were like what the hell
16:01 - you have Wi-Fi in your house cuz it was
16:03 - like this thing that you would only get
16:04 - at school and so we'd hack um well not
16:06 - hack but I would get my Dad's laptop
16:09 - download a bunch of things back in the
16:10 - day was lime wire uh MSN Messenger and
16:14 - then within probably a month the
16:16 - computer would just be toast because
16:17 - it's just full of malware and that sort
16:20 - of stuff um would you like format it and
16:23 - like just try again well that's the
16:26 - thing like it was just like we would
16:28 - never reset said that it would just go
16:29 - to um the IT department and uh we don't
16:32 - know if it was like getting reset or if
16:35 - they just gave him a new one or whatnot
16:37 - but um he he he legitimately hard they
16:39 - must have hated him every month he
16:41 - brings in like his malware L computer
16:43 - that he doesn't even use exactly like
16:46 - the It people are like doing labor for
16:48 - his crazy kids just surfing the web
16:50 - being Reckless right that's
16:52 - funny oh and then then we kind of got a
16:55 - a bit um I guess you could say
16:57 - entrepreneurial or nefarious I guess
17:00 - it's been enough time you can tell these
17:02 - stories now is that um my dad had the
17:03 - teachers login right and so the teachers
17:06 - login had access to all the student hard
17:08 - drives and so um my friend and I in high
17:12 - school we actually had a little side
17:13 - business um like hacking into the smart
17:16 - kids and like selling their assignments
17:19 - to people who uh which in retrospect I
17:23 - don't condone this but it's like that's
17:25 - basically I wanted more time to play
17:27 - video games so I didn't have a job
17:29 - I would just like we ran a business uh
17:32 - hacking into other students
17:34 - assignments um wow which that's pretty
17:38 - pretty it's like CH before Che right
17:41 - yeah exactly yeah like like homework
17:43 - assignments but it was it was local to
17:45 - the school so yeah I mean that's
17:47 - industrious and I'm not going to travel
17:49 - back in time and condemn your kid even
17:51 - though obviously preo camp we have very
17:52 - high standards for academic honesty and
17:55 - I I am not going to condone any such
17:58 - thing but I will say that like I mean
18:01 - that is something you can do like I used
18:02 - to print out Mortal Kombat moves lists
18:05 - like back in in the arcade like nobody
18:08 - knew the moves you had to like learn the
18:09 - moves through trial and eror like oh
18:10 - forward down forward forward High punch
18:13 - we'll do this Subzero you know Fine
18:14 - Thing uh but like people didn't know
18:17 - that so I like collected all that stuff
18:19 - and I formatted this nice sheet and I
18:21 - would like take it to the arcades and I
18:22 - be like hey you you know you want all
18:24 - the moves from Mortal Kombat they be
18:25 - like sure be like all right five bucks
18:27 - and like just sell it and like exactly
18:29 - money just materializing out of nowhere
18:30 - right uh so similarly kind of like that
18:33 - early
18:35 - hustle well yes exactly I would I would
18:37 - much more recommend that route of
18:39 - actually creating materials in academic
18:42 - honesty but this is this is almost like
18:45 - pre this is I think I was like 14 or 15
18:47 - so I kind of I'm like well the file's
18:49 - already there like we hadn't really been
18:52 - bombarded with like the importance of
18:54 - academic Integrity just yet and I'm just
18:57 - like well I have all these people who
18:59 - are like uh no one was doing their
19:01 - assignments cuz we were all I knew they
19:02 - weren't because we were all playing
19:03 - video games together and then I was
19:06 - like anyway um so basically into
19:10 - computers like the whole time um and
19:12 - then uh yeah Outdoors was just because
19:16 - it's I feel like it's in Australia it's
19:17 - like it's there so you're just um into
19:20 - it like we go to the the beach like for
19:23 - family holidays like we have so Brisbane
19:26 - uh North is the Sunshine Coast about an
19:28 - an hour drive 45 minutes and that's a
19:31 - whole bunch of beautiful beaches and
19:33 - then an hour south is the Gold Coast
19:35 - which I'm sure many people around the
19:37 - world have heard of and that's again
19:39 - just a collection of of some of the best
19:41 - beaches in the world so it's whereas
19:45 - like other cities like Perth there's a
19:47 - beach at the city so like you're uh you
19:50 - could have skyscrapers but then 10
19:52 - minutes down the street it's like ocean
19:55 - and then of course Sydney there's Bondi
19:56 - Beach all that sort of stuff so it's
19:58 - like it's very yeah ingrained in
19:59 - Australian culture to to be beachy and
20:03 - Outdoors but and because most of the
20:06 - population is I think it's within 25 km
20:10 - of a coastline like 95% plus of the
20:13 - population is within 25 km of a of a
20:16 - coastline so it's kind of just ingrained
20:19 - in us to to go to the beach or to be
20:22 - outdoors and I feel like we're kind of a
20:26 - couple of years behind in terms of tech
20:28 - technology well that's what I noticed as
20:31 - a kid was like we'd always you'd see the
20:33 - new stuff get released in like the us or
20:36 - uh UK and we kind of it would trickle
20:39 - down to Australia in like 2 to 3 years I
20:42 - think the Gap as as like slightly Clos
20:44 - because of just globalization and
20:46 - whatnot but especially when I was
20:48 - hacking around on my Dad's laptop I'd be
20:50 - see all these new releases and be like
20:52 - oh I got to wait like 2 to 3 years I
20:54 - remember buying like my first Xbox
20:57 - accessory on the internet net and like
20:59 - having to convince my mom that it was
21:00 - safe and it took 6 weeks to arrive and
21:04 - then it was like it broke after 2 or 3
21:08 - days and then it took 8 weeks to send
21:11 - back and get another one and like that
21:14 - me geographically you're very far from
21:17 - you know I know you're a lot closer to
21:19 - Asia than you are to North America
21:21 - that's what I mean right so a lot of
21:23 - things arrive late in Australia but not
21:25 - Wi-Fi it was indeed invented by the
21:29 - Australian science uh Bureau or or I
21:33 - can't can't it's it's called uh it's
21:35 - called CS i o the National Science
21:38 - agency so like as as a taxpaying
21:41 - American one of the one of the I guess
21:44 - many developments that that have come
21:47 - out of like the US government uh is what
21:51 - is GPS right like so all those GPS
21:54 - satellites that was technically like us
21:57 - taxpayers that like subsidize the
21:59 - development for that for and now
22:01 - everyone in the world gets a benefit
22:02 - from having like Apple Maps or Google
22:05 - Maps or um you know various tools that
22:07 - they can embed into their website or GIS
22:09 - systems things like that um and I want
22:12 - to thank the people of Australia for
22:14 - subsidizing development of Wi-Fi because
22:16 - I use it every day exactly same thing
22:19 - it's kind of yeah ubiquitous now you
22:22 - know yeah yeah I mean like those waves
22:25 - are passing through you as we speak
22:27 - they're everywhere
22:29 - yeah well maybe actually yeah maybe in a
22:31 - 100 years time we'll kind of go oh maybe
22:33 - it wasn't a good idea to pass
22:35 - electromagnetic waves through uh the
22:37 - entire world yeah but it's not ionizing
22:40 - I don't think it's too big a deal we'll
22:42 - see we'll see I could be wrong touchwood
22:44 - as they say in Australia or knock on
22:46 - wood as they say here in the US uh
22:50 - so I am really stoked to so it sounds
22:53 - like you had a great childhood um being
22:56 - uh an outdoorsy being a slacker you know
23:00 - the there's this saying about
23:02 - programmers that like the best
23:03 - programmers are lazy cuz they'll figure
23:05 - out like inventive ways to not have to
23:08 - do
23:08 - work um and it sounds like you're like
23:13 - at least like as a child you were
23:15 - someone lazy uh is that is that a
23:18 - mischaracterization well I was lazy
23:20 - towards the things that I was um told to
23:22 - do in a sense like so school like I was
23:25 - I was kind of uh naturally curious in
23:30 - terms of I would just I remember when I
23:31 - was like 10 I just would read the I read
23:34 - this Atlas like back to front like this,
23:36 - 1100 page Atlas and so I just I got an A
23:39 - in geography Without Really Trying but I
23:41 - was just fascinated by uh this this
23:44 - Atlas And so that Trend kind of
23:45 - continued through High School Xbox came
23:48 - out and I just would play Call of Duty
23:50 - and we we we ran the the number one this
23:53 - is back before e-gaming was like a a
23:55 - thing um Esports sorry um um we had this
23:59 - online forum and I would just we was
24:02 - like six of us at high school we had
24:03 - this team and our team was the number
24:05 - one in Australia so I would get home
24:06 - from school from like 3:30 cuz I liveed
24:08 - so close and we'd just plan strategies
24:11 - for Call of Duty until like midnight and
24:13 - then I'd go to sleep and wake up at 10:
24:15 - to 8: to be at school by 8:15 um so that
24:18 - was basically my senior years at high
24:20 - school but it was I would I would like
24:23 - just I don't know get passing grades
24:26 - through high school not really excelling
24:28 - but we we really did excel at Call of
24:31 - Duty because it was just fascinating to
24:34 - us you could put that as an
24:35 - extracurricular on your college
24:37 - application I guess like one Call of
24:39 - Duty team in
24:41 - Australia maybe the counselor would like
24:43 - recognize the value in that did you did
24:45 - you end up going to school like
24:46 - University or what did you do I did I
24:49 - did straight out of high school I went
24:50 - to University the University of
24:52 - Queensland which is a beautiful
24:54 - University one of the best in Australia
24:56 - and it's um it's uh uh for the first two
24:59 - years I was kind of just floundering
25:01 - around and um because it was just the
25:03 - thing that you did right um I didn't
25:05 - really know what I wanted to do out of
25:08 - high school because as I said I was just
25:10 - into Call of Duty but um or into
25:13 - computer games but back then 2010 that
25:16 - was not viable like to keep going down
25:19 - that path like computer video games it's
25:22 - still not really viable like like the
25:24 - biggest like Esports like the I my
25:28 - understanding is they got a lot of
25:29 - investment but they haven't been able to
25:30 - recoup that and a lot of them are not
25:32 - very solvent right now um well that's
25:34 - what I mean right like it's like yeah it
25:36 - was it was if it's a if it's a fake
25:39 - business now it was even more of a fake
25:41 - business um like in 2010 when I
25:44 - graduated high school but then yeah I I
25:46 - went to University kind of just um I was
25:49 - like I wanted to be a doctor for the I
25:53 - guess more so for the just The Prestige
25:55 - of saying I'm I'm a doctor rather than
25:57 - that was
25:58 - fundamentally it's a powerful thing to
26:00 - be able to say at a dinner party or on a
26:02 - plane when somebody's having Cardiac
26:03 - Arrest I'm a doctor everybody fors and
26:07 - you can walk right over and you can help
26:08 - the person right uh exactly I I can
26:11 - definitely see the
26:12 - appeal yeah so that's that's that's that
26:14 - was the main reason was more so for the
26:16 - status rather than for the the uh like
26:19 - actual will to or interest in studying
26:23 - human systems and helping people and so
26:25 - I basically fa failed almost every
26:28 - subject for the first two years of
26:29 - University before I got called in by the
26:32 - dean of Science and to his credit was
26:36 - basically like hey is everything okay
26:39 - like your grades are terrible and should
26:42 - you really be at University if you're if
26:44 - you're getting grades and um I kind of
26:48 - offered the um excuse that my dad was
26:51 - sick and like he he was and still is but
26:55 - it was really just because I was like
26:57 - well I'm lazy and I'm not really
26:59 - interested in what I'm studying and so
27:03 - on the side of that was the real reason
27:05 - the good reason was oh yeah my dad was
27:07 - sick please don't kick me out of
27:08 - University um but on the side while I
27:12 - was doing biom medicine and that sort of
27:14 - stuff I was studying food science and
27:17 - nutrition on my own uh because I was
27:19 - getting into the gym and I'm like I want
27:20 - to be fit I want to be healthy I want to
27:22 - lift weights I want to build muscle and
27:25 - so I was watching YouTube till 11:00
27:27 - p.m. at night of people talking about
27:31 - how to work out bodybuilding nutrition
27:33 - that sort of stuff and so I was telling
27:35 - him that that's like he's like what are
27:37 - you interested in I'm like well I've
27:39 - been learning about this and he's like
27:40 - why don't you just change to food
27:43 - science and nutrition and I was like huh
27:46 - like a light bulb clicked I was like
27:48 - yeah you're right I can just change to
27:51 - what I'm interested in I kind of didn't
27:54 - I don't know it sounds like such a
27:55 - simple realization but um because I was
27:58 - so sort of stuck in that uh floundering
28:02 - mindset of like I don't really want to
28:04 - study this I'm failing this scks um I
28:08 - don't really know I'm kind of lost
28:10 - basically um that was just such a simple
28:13 - light bulb and I'm still really thankful
28:16 - to uh his name is Peter or it might have
28:18 - been pod I think pod's his nickname but
28:21 - Peter said he's like why don't you just
28:24 - study what you're interested in you're
28:25 - already learning about it and I'm like
28:26 - wow such a simple realization and then I
28:30 - I changed to food science Nutrition the
28:32 - next semester and basically got top of
28:36 - the class for the next 3 years cuz I I'd
28:38 - already many of the things in the first
28:39 - two years I'd already like learned on my
28:42 - own and so that was kind of like Premed
28:45 - was probably what you were studying do
28:46 - they have an equivalent Premed yeah yeah
28:49 - uh you probably already knew a lot about
28:52 - like biology right like all the
28:53 - different you know metabolism systems
28:56 - and stuff like that
28:58 - sort of I didn't even do biology in high
29:01 - school when I say I was really just like
29:03 - oh this girl is that I like is also
29:05 - doing um biom medicine I want to do biom
29:09 - medicine because I like this girl and I
29:12 - also like the idea of one day telling
29:14 - people I'm I'm a doctor but that's that
29:17 - was 17-year-old me and I guess with time
29:20 - you become a little wiser hopefully so
29:23 - um yeah that's what that's what happened
29:24 - and then yeah studied that and then
29:27 - passed with or actually didn't just pass
29:30 - like almost top of the class the whole
29:32 - way through and then uh graduated with
29:35 - that and I basically that was the more
29:38 - important lesson was learning how to
29:41 - learn like I I I realized that I was
29:43 - like oh if I'm interested in something
29:46 - and I just dedicate myself in a semi
29:48 - structured SL experimental fashion I can
29:53 - learn whatever I want basically like it
29:55 - felt that's how it felt that it felt
29:57 - like a superpower it was was like oh I'm
29:59 - just going to have to devote myself
30:01 - wholeheartedly to something that I'm
30:04 - fascinated and interested in yeah
30:07 - subsequently coding programming is just
30:10 - basically exactly the same
30:12 - thing yeah recurring uh character
30:15 - stepping onto the stage of the preo camp
30:17 - podcast each week learning how to learn
30:20 - uh and of course obligatory mention of
30:23 - Barbara Oakley's uh learn how to learn
30:25 - course which you know Leon Noel has
30:27 - mentioned
30:28 - I think Ben Awad mentioned it like a lot
30:30 - of different people who've been on the
30:32 - podcast have talked about the uh
30:34 - learning how to learn and just what it
30:36 - unlocks for you like I I'll I'll go on
30:40 - Soliloquy here uh developers the number
30:43 - one job descript is not sitting there
30:45 - and turning coffee into code or whatever
30:47 - it says on the cup uh but rather
30:50 - learning that is the killer app that is
30:52 - really what you're paid to do is learn
30:54 - what this Legacy code base is what it
30:57 - how it works
30:58 - and then going in and learning you know
31:01 - what you need to do to accomplish
31:02 - whatever goal has been put in front of
31:03 - you by your boss or by the open source
31:06 - Community or whoever you're beholden to
31:08 - um to get things done right so um yeah
31:11 - learn how to
31:12 - learn all right that that concludes the
31:14 - little the little ad read for learn how
31:16 - to learn as a mentality and
31:20 - yeah so so you were able to finish
31:24 - school you walked away with not just a
31:26 - degree from a a good school uh but also
31:30 - probably a lot of knowledge about health
31:31 - and nutrition but also just like this
31:35 - skill to learn new things what do you do
31:37 - from there yeah I would say that's yeah
31:41 - that was yeah the learning how to learn
31:42 - was just that's the Meta School right
31:44 - you can apply that to anything so that
31:45 - was 2015 I graduated and then uh I
31:48 - studied um uh Eastern languages for a
31:51 - year because I was working at Apple as a
31:54 - um a genius quote unquote that that was
31:57 - my actual title
31:58 - like youd help people when their uh
32:00 - their Hardware wouldn't turn on or
32:02 - something like that what was the most
32:04 - common thing that people would ask for
32:06 - help
32:07 - with
32:09 - uh broken screens or battery life of
32:14 - iPhones okay and so and so um they and
32:18 - then of course backups so uh it's kind
32:22 - of been ingrained into me to be um uh
32:26 - how would you say kind of obs obsessed
32:28 - with backing things up so um the amount
32:31 - of times I would have to have a
32:33 - very difficult conversation with someone
32:35 - to basically say everything on your
32:37 - laptop is gone because you didn't have a
32:40 - backup and you spilled coffee all over
32:44 - it and now it won't turn on and that we
32:48 - basically couldn't help you you may be
32:49 - able to go to like a data recovery
32:51 - center but again that there's no
32:54 - promises there because I mean it's all
32:56 - liquid damaged so they were very tough
32:58 - conversations to have and so yeah I've
33:00 - got goodness like half a dozen backups
33:03 - of almost everything
33:06 - everywhere okay what just off the cuff
33:08 - what is a good backup strategy I talked
33:09 - to like the CTO of my company he had a
33:12 - hard drive like a local hard drive that
33:13 - he had like time machine on uh time
33:15 - machine being the Apple backup thing I'm
33:17 - not sure if it's still called time
33:19 - machine but he had time machine and
33:21 - every day when he showed up with his
33:22 - laptop he plugg into that external hard
33:24 - drive at work and then he had one at
33:26 - home and he plugged into that and his
33:27 - reasoning is it's unlikely that both of
33:30 - these hard drives going to are going to
33:31 - fail concurrently or that there's going
33:32 - to fire be a fire that breaks out both
33:34 - at my home and my office concurrently so
33:36 - as long as I have one backup I'm good
33:39 - but like would that level of redundancy
33:41 - be enough for you or do you have you go
33:42 - even more hardcore than that I would say
33:45 - that yeah that would be like the minimum
33:46 - for me is uh so I've got my my personal
33:50 - setup is just um got the external hard
33:53 - drive uh got two of those actually I
33:56 - have uh iCloud on my personal Mac and
34:00 - then I have Dropbox and then I have cuz
34:03 - again these are just ease of use and I
34:04 - think as a developer I could probably
34:05 - set up my own cloud bucket these days
34:07 - but just the ease of use of these
34:10 - software companies are basically
34:11 - dedicated towards backups and then
34:14 - finally back Blaze um so they do
34:17 - basically just a um complete
34:19 - encapsulation of your hard drive and put
34:22 - that on their cloud storage so there's
34:25 - about five different versions of my just
34:27 - my local
34:28 - um MacBook Pro but then I have my server
34:31 - upstairs my deep learning PC um and so
34:34 - right now that's a bit more rudimentary
34:35 - I kind of just um rsync uh cuz it's
34:39 - Linux machine I just
34:41 - rsync yeah every every week or so um
34:45 - with an external hard drive and then uh
34:48 - I cuz I basically just use it to write
34:49 - code that's all just get committed um
34:53 - and then so if I was if that computer
34:56 - again touch W was to just completely
34:58 - fail I could um get a new one tomorrow
35:02 - plug in the hard drive R sync it across
35:05 - it would take a bit set up of course and
35:07 - then get clone the repos that I've been
35:09 - working on and then be off to the market
35:12 - awesome so like I mean that's got to be
35:16 - a very difficult conversation to have
35:18 - with a total stranger who just walked in
35:20 - like you know I always think like if you
35:22 - ever played like Friday the 13th on NES
35:24 - when you lose it doesn't just say game
35:26 - over it says you and all your friends
35:28 - are dead game
35:30 - [Laughter]
35:32 - over it's almost like that that kind of
35:34 - thing like the text appears every file
35:37 - that you loved is gone forever it it
35:39 - wasn't yeah thankfully it was like it
35:42 - was fairly rare but it was often enough
35:44 - to to yeah to be burned into my brain um
35:48 - but yeah it was it was that
35:51 - was really that job was actually really
35:53 - cool because it was like it was I could
35:56 - work on technology all day just be
35:58 - fascinated by that cuz I'm a nerd and um
36:03 - I would just talk to people all day so
36:05 - that's like kind of it built up my
36:07 - people skills and communication skills
36:09 - CU I would have to explain like a
36:12 - hardware repair or a file system
36:15 - structure in a in a way that uh a
36:18 - grandmother could understand because all
36:19 - your customers would be from different
36:21 - walks of life some of them wouldn't be
36:23 - able to speak English as well as I could
36:26 - um cuz we were in the city I so we would
36:28 - get tourists we would get uh elderly
36:31 - people we would get University students
36:33 - and so um I think over my three or so
36:37 - years there working part-time I I served
36:39 - 4 and a half 5,000 customers and so um
36:44 - it's just that repetition h of
36:47 - explaining something in something that
36:48 - someone could understand it was and that
36:50 - kind of really helped me um going into
36:52 - like programming and then subsequently
36:55 - um teaching myself that cuz I was
36:58 - write notes and code and then explain it
36:59 - to myself in a simple way that I
37:01 - understood and then later on a few years
37:04 - later would be like okay I've kind of
37:06 - built up this latent skill of talking to
37:09 - people talking to anyone um cuz I drove
37:12 - Uber for a year as well um and so that's
37:15 - kind of uh um like another where like
37:18 - you get in and you're just meeting a new
37:19 - person every 10 minutes and it's like
37:21 - okay some people don't want to talk
37:23 - that's fair I'm quite the I don't know
37:25 - animated talkative person
37:28 - uh just generally I think I get that
37:30 - from being the oldest brother and kind
37:32 - of got to be almost the leader of the
37:34 - pack you know and
37:37 - um that kind of gave me that yeah latent
37:40 - skill of just being able to have a
37:42 - conversation with anyone about almost
37:44 - anything so i' would be comfortable in
37:47 - walking into any room and starting a
37:50 - conversation with someone um from from
37:53 - zero and then in a technical aspect I
37:56 - would also be quite com but there was
37:58 - something I knew explaining or figuring
38:00 - out the where where they were um in
38:04 - terms of the the knowledge stack uh
38:07 - whether it be zero or whether it be okay
38:09 - we can just talk as if we were um both
38:12 - completely on the same level um so I
38:14 - don't really have to explain everything
38:16 - in depth if you know what I mean so that
38:19 - was that was really valuable I didn't
38:21 - quite realize how valuable that was at
38:23 - the time it was just like oh this is a
38:24 - cool job I'm working for Apple it's it's
38:27 - the biggest technology company in the
38:28 - world um it's not necessarily on the
38:32 - building the machines or the um the
38:36 - software that's what I wanted to get
38:38 - into um right but it was yeah that skill
38:43 - that you sort of just like at University
38:45 - it was that meta skill that I didn't
38:46 - quite realize until after the fact that
38:48 - was so important it's like it's very
38:50 - easy to go oh yeah you learned food
38:52 - science and nutrition like that's the
38:53 - important thing you you learned from
38:55 - there and it's like well to me I look
38:57 - back and I was like I was studying that
38:58 - for fun uh yes it is very helpful to
39:00 - know about health and nutrition and
39:02 - fitness and whatnot but it's also really
39:05 - good meta skill to have is being able to
39:07 - learn something that you're interested
39:08 - in and then another meta skill of like
39:10 - being able to talk to almost anyone
39:13 - about anything and that's that's
39:14 - certainly just in retrospect that i'
39:16 - sort of noticed that and so yeah after I
39:18 - left University Apple um had a program
39:21 - that would um if you want because there
39:23 - was so many International customers if
39:25 - you wanted to uh do a language course
39:28 - they would subsidize the the language
39:31 - course um and so I studied Japanese and
39:33 - Chinese for a year at um at the same
39:35 - University that I went to because I was
39:37 - just really interested in eastern
39:39 - languages and Eastern culture and we had
39:41 - a few um Chinese and Japanese speaking
39:44 - people that worked with us so it could
39:45 - practice there and then when customers
39:47 - would come in um I could I could talk to
39:50 - them like one of my favorite things to
39:52 - say was like if it was a Chinese
39:53 - speaking customer I would be like May
39:57 - and would just like instantly recognize
39:58 - what I would say which is do you have a
40:00 - backup or not um because like just
40:03 - saying do you have a backup if if
40:05 - someone hadn't really um been studying
40:08 - English for a number of years that
40:12 - concept of backup idiomatic expression
40:14 - what does that mean exactly right
40:16 - they're like they're like what does that
40:16 - mean and then I'd say ne May B they be
40:19 - like and it's like Mayo like as in okay
40:22 - no back up it's like okay well then we
40:24 - need to focus on that first yeah
40:28 - yeah and in Japanese do they have like a
40:30 - word for that or they just say back
40:33 - up yeah I didn't yeah I didn't quite
40:35 - think like the terms we didn't get to
40:38 - use it as much in Japanese I don't know
40:40 - it I don't know it if they have a
40:41 - specific term because um I'm not sure
40:44 - what yeah they just say back up a larger
40:45 - customer base was yeah Chinese speaking
40:49 - Yeah Yeah but um say back up yeah you're
40:51 - right I think that might be correct and
40:53 - like B fun is is kind of like uh like
40:56 - piece of of equipment like
40:59 - equipment yeah cuz play B is like show B
41:03 - like like gear almost um yeah I'm sorry
41:06 - I'm not going to like try to pick apart
41:07 - the emology on
41:10 - like there may be some people in the
41:13 - audience who do yeah yeah I spent 20
41:15 - years like learning Chinese and I'm
41:17 - getting back in Japanese I'm going to go
41:18 - to Japan for summer uh so I've been like
41:21 - hardcore tooling up on my Japanese uh
41:24 - usage and and vocabulary and stuff but
41:26 - but yeah
41:28 - and if you hear my kids uh in the
41:29 - background they're very excited to be
41:30 - home after a long day of school so uh
41:33 - yeah that's super chill that you were
41:34 - able to like learn uh one thing that a
41:38 - lot of people may not understand is like
41:40 - the Australian economy and is like
41:43 - almost like closer and more interlined
41:46 - with like Japan and and China and and
41:49 - countries over in Asia than it is with
41:51 - like North America and Europe I mean
41:53 - would you say that's that's accurate
41:55 - just because of the location the time
41:56 - zones
41:58 - yeah I think so yeah we definitely have
42:00 - I I don't I'm not qu quite really well
42:03 - versed on um political relations between
42:05 - other countries but um yeah we
42:07 - definitely do a lot of trade with China
42:08 - I think a lot of our um and in Japan
42:11 - actually my brother is an accountant who
42:13 - um uh who audits large companies in
42:16 - Australia and um there was this one uh
42:20 - Meat Company so we have a lot of Outback
42:23 - and land so Farms to to raise cattle and
42:26 - whatnot and uh my brother was working on
42:29 - the their case and he said that they
42:32 - export they had one customer from Japan
42:35 - who who who runs like this really nice
42:37 - restaurant in Japan flew to Australia
42:39 - and bought $25 million worth of meat to
42:42 - ship back to Japan so that's just like
42:45 - one one customer so um I was like w um
42:50 - CU he had to come to Australia to see it
42:51 - in person to make sure it was high
42:53 - enough quality for the restaurant and so
42:54 - I'm just imagining if that's just if
42:56 - that's one customer who like running a
42:57 - high-end restaurant in Japan like
42:59 - imagine how many other deals are going
43:01 - on in other areas so uh yeah we
43:04 - definitely definitely have a lot of
43:05 - exports I know we we export a lot of
43:08 - wine and whatnot to to China and that
43:10 - sort of stuff so yeah and and I mean
43:12 - this podcast isn't about Australia but
43:14 - but I do want to note for a lot of
43:15 - people they they may not realize just
43:18 - the population of Australia is pretty
43:20 - small it's like maybe 25 30 million
43:22 - people like uh that's it yeah 25 it
43:24 - might not even be 25 I think it just
43:27 - under 25 I I but yeah it's definitely
43:30 - around that Brisbane the city that I
43:32 - live in is like 2 to 2 A2 million I
43:35 - think Sydney is number one at about 3
43:37 - and 1/2 to 4 million Melbourne's around
43:39 - 3 to 3 and A2 um around that and so
43:43 - that's about over 50% of the population
43:45 - is just on the east coast in three major
43:48 - cities uh and then so it's yeah
43:50 - decreasing after that so yeah and to put
43:52 - that in context that's smaller than the
43:54 - population of Texas just one of the 56
43:57 - one of the bigger yeah uh W just Texas
44:02 - yeah oh my goodness yeah uh so so it's
44:05 - like we hear all this stuff about
44:06 - Australia of course it's like a big pop
44:08 - cult like so many amazing musicians
44:10 - especially from the past 15 years or so
44:12 - have come out of Australia but it's
44:13 - actually not that many people especially
44:15 - when you compare to like China the big
44:17 - you know economic superpower of the
44:19 - region over there right we're small but
44:21 - Marty you know down here in Australia
44:23 - the way down yeah very cool so uh that's
44:28 - so cool so you got to learn some
44:29 - language and I just want to back up and
44:31 - talk about th those two meta skills you
44:33 - talk about learning how to learn and
44:34 - then learning how to take what You' just
44:36 - learned and communicate it to people
44:38 - like you may have not realized it at the
44:40 - time but you were basically learning
44:42 - everything you needed to know to be a
44:43 - successful tutorial Creator probably
44:46 - like would would you say that's the case
44:48 - yeah so I didn't even yeah it's it's
44:51 - again hindsight's 2020 right you can
44:54 - look back and go wow that's that's how
44:55 - you can apply that to this
44:57 - um and so that's that's a really hard
45:00 - thing when when people say oh you need
45:02 - experience for for jobs and whatnot and
45:04 - it's like it's sometimes the experience
45:06 - that you have isn't that
45:08 - quantifiable um whereas like yeah if I
45:10 - have a degree in in XY Z that's really
45:13 - quantifiable but then there's other
45:14 - things like I've talked to 5,000 people
45:17 - I'm not sure how many resumés um like
45:20 - you'll see that sort of as a extra
45:22 - curriculum kind of thing if you know
45:24 - what I mean yeah but also my my dad was
45:27 - a teacher and so I kind of I guess just
45:30 - that was just in nature and nurture as I
45:32 - was growing up and um we ran a family
45:36 - swim school like that was our family
45:38 - business and so I was a swimming coach
45:40 - from basically um 13 onwards growing up
45:43 - in the business and just interacting
45:45 - with with customers um of our of our
45:48 - business and learning how to teach teach
45:50 - swimming to to children and people the
45:52 - same age as me and so I feel like
45:55 - looking back it's it's yeah you you kind
45:58 - of realize it's like oh that actually
45:59 - helped for this that actually helped for
46:01 - that and you kind of piece the puzzle
46:05 - together yeah yeah well uh that's so
46:08 - cool it sounds like you had like a
46:09 - pretty industrious upbringing I didn't
46:11 - even realize you were like a swim
46:13 - instructor I guess all the water around
46:14 - it makes sense to get really good at
46:17 - swimming I don't I don't like pools very
46:19 - much anymore though because uh yeah I
46:22 - spent basically every day in a pool for
46:24 - 10 years wow so like one of the things
46:28 - that people enjoy unwinding with you're
46:29 - just dreading it like oh not the pool
46:31 - again they're R just as a kid I was like
46:35 - well as long as if it's fresh water like
46:36 - it's it's like okay but it's like um
46:39 - because chlorine like I was just I just
46:41 - always smelled like chlorine as a kid
46:43 - and I it's just like no I'm like if the
46:46 - pool's chlorine it's like I'll I'll
46:47 - happily skip that I'll just wait till we
46:49 - go to the beach or something yeah so
46:52 - let's talk about you know your
46:54 - progression into the workforce not just
46:56 - as like a Serv sector I mean like that's
46:58 - a really cool thing to be able to CL
47:00 - like I helped 5,000 not just talk to
47:02 - 5,000 people but like helped them solve
47:05 - their problems right at the Apple App
47:07 - Store over the course of like three
47:08 - years uh and sometimes even using
47:10 - foreign languages in the process uh can
47:12 - you talk about like how you ultimately
47:14 - transitioned into software
47:17 - development yeah
47:18 - so okay so 2016 I studied languages
47:21 - working parttime at Apple and then the
47:23 - start of 2017 was when I was like okay I
47:26 - go to I want to I always wanted to like
47:30 - basically code apps or build something
47:33 - that I was like I was using these
47:34 - computers every day and I'm like I want
47:36 - to build something that's like of my own
47:39 - um and so the start of 2017 I think it
47:41 - was about February I was just like I
47:43 - handed in uh my resignation to Apple and
47:48 - um my friend who worked there as well
47:50 - handed in his resonation at the same
47:51 - time and then we're like okay we're
47:53 - going to build we're going to work on a
47:55 - startup together and so this is where
47:57 - free code Camp came into play uh we were
47:59 - learning web development and we were
48:01 - going to the gym and we were like it
48:04 - really sucks that we can't work out
48:06 - together because you go to gym X and I
48:09 - go to gym Y and so we um started to
48:12 - build a website that we were like Airbnb
48:14 - was getting really big and we were like
48:17 - there should be an Airbnb for gyms and
48:20 - so that's what we started to build was
48:22 - any gym and we built out the website it
48:25 - was it wasn't coded from scratch so
48:26 - wasn't quite free code Camp spec it was
48:28 - just WordPress and um like a bunch of
48:31 - different plugins like maps and all
48:33 - these sort of things but we were we were
48:34 - piecing it together it kind of it looked
48:36 - pretty good from a design
48:38 - standpoint but then okay we're like okay
48:41 - now we have this website but now we need
48:45 - customers and so because in again in
48:48 - retrospect I didn't even know that it
48:49 - was a Marketplace um but that's what it
48:53 - was I was just like okay yeah every be
48:55 - like a two-sided Marketplace
48:57 - that's what I mean yeah sorry yeah
48:59 - you're right like yeah Airbnb has the
49:00 - marketplace of the the host of people
49:03 - who put up their homes or apartments and
49:05 - that sort of stuff and then it has the
49:07 - the customers who rent space in those
49:09 - and so in our case the host would be the
49:12 - gyms so they would offer their gym space
49:16 - that already exists and the customers
49:18 - would be people like me and my friend
49:20 - who didn't necessarily want a membership
49:22 - there uh like mbnb you don't want to
49:25 - rent the place for a year you just want
49:27 - to stay in there for or and then the
49:29 - same with with anyy was I just want to
49:32 - go for a session and I want that to be
49:34 - easy rather than to walk in sign all the
49:37 - the forms pay the fee get harassed by
49:41 - Gym Consultants or that sort of stuff I
49:43 - just want to pay whatever it is and do
49:44 - one session and be done and so we were
49:47 - thought yeah that's great in our heads
49:49 - yeah I mean I can tell you from having
49:50 - gone to like my friend's gym like I want
49:52 - to be a guest and then like you go you
49:54 - work out for like 20 minutes or
49:55 - something you're like all right let's
49:56 - Jet and then there's a sales guy who
49:58 - Corners you takes you in a room like hey
50:00 - you got to sign up and do like all this
50:02 - gives you the hard cell right like I
50:03 - don't want that I just want to go work
50:05 - out yeah yeah so I feel like there's
50:08 - still there's still room for for some
50:10 - I'm not working on this now like it the
50:12 - startup didn't work because um but I
50:14 - still feel like there's room for it if
50:16 - we could work if you could work out the
50:17 - right model and get the gyms on board
50:19 - and get safety all that sort of jazz
50:22 - ready but we were like okay we've got
50:25 - map we can find gy in a local area using
50:28 - Google Maps API all and then uh we're
50:31 - like well we actually need to get like
50:33 - we can't just have people rocking up to
50:34 - these gyms like we don't have uh like
50:38 - passes or anything and so we like okay
50:40 - we're just going to go on foot and so we
50:42 - just mapped out like a section of the
50:44 - town like near where his apartment was
50:47 - and we're like there's 10 gyms in this
50:48 - area let's just walk to them yeah today
50:51 - and talk to them and again young and
50:54 - naive just like going through like hey
50:56 - this this is this is our cool bit
50:58 - service we want to get you more
50:59 - customers and we started talking to them
51:02 - and then we kind of quickly realized
51:03 - that uh we didn't have a business unless
51:06 - we could get the gyms on board and um we
51:09 - then also realized that after we got
51:12 - pretty close with one of the gym
51:13 - managers and they were sort of like I
51:14 - like this idea but look at this and then
51:17 - they showed us their sort of numbers and
51:19 - they had 2,000 clients signed up but
51:24 - only 100 of them would come more than
51:26 - once a week and so he's he basically
51:29 - told us that their business model
51:32 - depends on people not showing up so I
51:35 - was like because if all 2,000 people
51:37 - came at one point no um the gym would
51:40 - obviously be overrun right and so so
51:43 - it's almost like you're solving a
51:45 - problem that is actually like a feature
51:47 - not a bug of the way the gy work yes and
51:50 - so we wanted more people to come to the
51:52 - gym but they're like we we we don't want
51:55 - more people we want more people sign up
51:57 - and and have those memberships that you
51:59 - forget about and just do the direct
52:01 - debit every week or month or whatever it
52:03 - is and you don't come to the gym and so
52:07 - we were just like oh and then we kind of
52:09 - went to another gym we kind of realized
52:10 - that that's just a repeating function
52:12 - that you get all these people who sign
52:14 - up for the gym at the start of the year
52:15 - and then go five times in
52:18 - January and then basically the the curve
52:21 - just drops off you go four times in
52:23 - February three times in March and then
52:25 - by June you you've forgotten about it
52:27 - and you're doing something else and then
52:29 - of course the hurdle to cancel it is not
52:31 - just like I'd like to cancel my gym
52:33 - membership it's like talk to our sales
52:35 - guy about why you'd like to to uh cancel
52:37 - it and so in theory it was a great
52:40 - business but then in practice it was
52:42 - like oh okay we the gyms depend on
52:46 - people not showing up and so if we were
52:48 - trying to charge a smaller fee for a one
52:50 - off it doesn't help their business yeah
52:54 - I mean like some of these like at least
52:56 - in the US sorry to go on like a long
52:57 - tangent about gyms you're but uh yeah in
53:00 - in the US there was like this big chain
53:02 - of like gyms was like I think it was
53:04 - like balles or something like that and
53:06 - they like signed people up for like
53:07 - these five 10e contracts or something
53:09 - like that and they they literally went
53:11 - out of business and people still had to
53:14 - pay for the next 5 years they're like no
53:17 - longer rendering services but the the
53:19 - contract was so Ironclad that people had
53:21 - to continue to pay for the next 5 years
53:23 - and they didn't get any gy in return it
53:25 - was just going to like the crors of the
53:27 - gym or whatever yeah so uh well that's
53:30 - what I mean it's I Ed the YCA the YMCA
53:34 - here in the US it's it's a charity they
53:36 - probably have them in Australia too it's
53:38 - a charity that was started 150 years ago
53:42 - and uh they may use some pushy
53:44 - techniques but like my experience has
53:47 - been like we just go there uh we we have
53:50 - like a family family membership whenever
53:51 - we travel like over the summer I'll
53:53 - often go to like Asia because my my kids
53:55 - live in Asia or I'm sorry my my my
53:58 - grandparents live in Asia my wife's from
54:00 - China uh we met in grad school and we
54:02 - might like leave and we can just go in
54:04 - and we can freeze the membership for two
54:05 - months and we don't have to pay anything
54:07 - it's not a big deal yeah see and so like
54:10 - I hope more gyms be like adopt that
54:12 - approach of like building up a
54:13 - reputation over like 150 years and like
54:16 - just being a chill wholesome place to
54:18 - work out rather than like being pushy
54:20 - and like using these techniques but I
54:22 - can definitely see based on everything
54:23 - you said that this would be like a
54:24 - non-starter of a business
54:27 - exactly right like it was so perfect in
54:29 - our heads and then yeah in in reality uh
54:33 - and I think that's like just another
54:35 - again in retrospect like an important
54:37 - thing of like okay well we test as soon
54:39 - as possible in the real world like is
54:41 - does this actually work because many
54:44 - great ideas are in theory but then in in
54:47 - do they translate to reality well yeah
54:50 - we got to test for it right well since
54:52 - we're talking earlier about China and
54:54 - Chinese I will take the opportunity to
54:57 - share one of those beautiful four
54:59 - character idioms in Chinese yeah Z which
55:04 - is close the doors and build the Chariot
55:06 - there was this like old inventor from
55:09 - like ancient China when of course all
55:11 - these like four character idioms came
55:13 - about and uh he had this Vision this
55:17 - kind of like platonic ideal of like what
55:19 - a car should be like the concept car
55:21 - like the uh the Cyber truck of his day
55:25 - right and so he goes in and he like
55:28 - builds it and everything and and he's
55:30 - making all these fine tuns based on his
55:32 - theory he's Theory crafting right but he
55:35 - never actually takes it out on the road
55:36 - and when his Masterpiece is finally done
55:38 - he takes it out on the road just falls
55:40 - apart it doesn't work at all and so he
55:43 - sunk all that time into it he he closed
55:46 - the doors and built the Chariot when he
55:48 - should have been doing what you did very
55:49 - early on which is go out and actually
55:51 - talk to people running the gyms like I
55:54 - could easily see you and your friends
55:57 - spending like months developing this
55:59 - prototype before you went out and got
56:01 - that user research done and so it sounds
56:03 - like you dodged a bullet by just quickly
56:06 - discovering oh this is not like this is
56:08 - not going to happen because the
56:09 - fundamental economics and the incentives
56:11 - of the people in this space dictate that
56:13 - Airbnb for gyms is not like a great idea
56:16 - and I I frequently said Airbnb is not a
56:18 - great idea and I'm amazed that people
56:20 - actually let strangers into their house
56:23 - uh to to stay like for short periods of
56:25 - time when they're not like professional
56:26 - hot tells they know what they're doing
56:27 - you know but um but yeah like like kudos
56:31 - to you for quickly iterating on your
56:33 - idea and and incorporating the feedback
56:36 - so did it become apparent pretty quickly
56:38 - that you should just Scupper this idea
56:40 - and move on to something
56:42 - else yeah it
56:44 - well my memory is probably a bit hazy on
56:47 - exact timelines but let's just say there
56:49 - a few months we probably spent uh a
56:51 - couple of weeks cuz this is we had no
56:53 - jobs it was kind of like um we're living
56:55 - off savings and my friend had an
56:56 - apartment at uh at um West End which is
57:00 - a suburb towards a city in Brisbane and
57:03 - I was just like basically sleeping on
57:05 - his couch and um studying through the
57:07 - day trying to build this website and
57:09 - then because he lived close to a few
57:11 - gyms we went around and we're like well
57:14 - we should probably test this quite
57:15 - quickly um because we we wanted to start
57:18 - making money uh because again we had no
57:20 - jobs and we were just living off savings
57:23 - um yeah so we found out I would say it
57:25 - was definely not longer than 6 months
57:28 - and probably closer to 3 to 4 that we
57:31 - were we were working on that um because
57:33 - the website truth be told was quite
57:35 - simplistic you had a a place to sign up
57:37 - for customers and a place to find gyms
57:39 - and then a place for um again we
57:42 - probably have to work out a lot of the
57:43 - payment system as it worked but it's
57:46 - like no point having a great payment
57:48 - system if no money is slowing through
57:50 - right so you you it sounds like this was
57:53 - like the mother of all kind of practice
57:55 - projects like you were getting to turn
57:57 - around and apply your nent coding skills
58:00 - to immediately build out this product
58:03 - and and you know yeah well it was a
58:05 - problem that we had like it was like
58:07 - there was a group of us at at working at
58:09 - the Apple Store that would um like we
58:11 - were all in the gym but because it the
58:12 - store was in the middle of the city you
58:14 - had people who lived everywhere around
58:16 - the city and so it was unfeasible to
58:19 - always just go One Direction we just
58:21 - wanted to stay in the city and go
58:23 - somewhere just local so it just made
58:25 - sense to us of like like as if you'd go
58:27 - to a restaurant you just walk in and buy
58:29 - a meal we're like we want that we want
58:31 - that workflow to to work for gyms
58:34 - instead of yeah walk in sign the form
58:37 - get 100 text messages from someone
58:39 - asking you if you want to sign up which
58:41 - is like no a simple transaction you know
58:44 - and like I think Apple pay was out by
58:46 - that stage I'm not entirely sure so it's
58:48 - like it could just be a past that you
58:50 - just walk in and scan yeah anyway that
58:53 - was maybe maybe it could work these days
58:55 - I think class pass is like another big
58:57 - startup that was doing something similar
58:58 - I think they they actually got funding
59:00 - and maybe made it to profitability I'm
59:02 - not entirely sure but uh that that was
59:06 - yeah my my dive into web development and
59:10 - then pretty quickly after that I uh
59:13 - realized that web development for me was
59:16 - far too tedious I'm like I want to do
59:18 - programming cuz I was like I have to
59:19 - build the workflow for that to go to
59:20 - there to go to there that to go to there
59:22 - like just every every block like again
59:25 - this is my laziness kicking in I was
59:27 - like how could I the whole point of this
59:29 - was to automate the stuff but right now
59:32 - I'm just building everything step by
59:33 - step and then of course machine learning
59:36 - was uh before it was really called AI it
59:40 - was was on the rise and then uh um
59:43 - basically every Tech podcast that I
59:45 - listen to um or YouTube video that I
59:48 - watched was about technology and then
59:50 - someone would talk about uh machine
59:52 - learning and then I was like what is
59:54 - this and then I started to of research
59:56 - into machine learning and then I was
59:58 - like oh so you just tell the computer
60:01 - here's my stuff you learn the patents
60:04 - and I was like yeah that's that's what
60:06 - I'm talking about that's what I want to
60:07 - use computers for so it's like that that
60:09 - laziness creeping back in like computer
60:12 - do the hard work for me you do the work
60:14 - yeah exactly um and so yeah that just
60:17 - began the fascination I think I probably
60:20 - discovered it properly in the middle of
60:23 - 2017 cuz I left Apple it started 2017
60:27 - and then uh we we worked on the startup
60:29 - for a few
60:30 - months caned it because yeah it's like
60:33 - well we've spoken to enough gyms now I
60:35 - bet you this is the case around every
60:37 - gym um and also we're we're young and
60:39 - naive I'm like 24 or 25 or whatnot and
60:43 - have no money so it's like if we had
60:45 - millions of funding we could probably
60:46 - sway the gyms in some way but we were
60:48 - like bootstrapping the whole thing yeah
60:50 - anyway um we yeah so middle of 2017
60:55 - start get into machine learning and on
60:57 - the weekends I was driving Uber so to
61:00 - support myself so I was still living at
61:02 - home with my parents and um so I had a a
61:05 - pretty strict routine for I guess 9 to
61:09 - 12 months of just Monday to Friday study
61:13 - study machine learning and Friday night
61:17 - Saturday afternoon tonight and Sunday
61:19 - morning is Drive Uber because they were
61:22 - the best they were the best days in
61:24 - terms of economics Friday night
61:25 - everyone's going out Sly so I was a
61:27 - Hermit for like a good a good solid year
61:30 - um and this is where I sort of middle of
61:34 - 2017 discovered like machine learning
61:37 - end of 2017 like September or close to
61:39 - the end I created my own AI master's
61:42 - degree which was just I'd kind of done
61:45 - enough two to three months of like
61:47 - Foundation stuff in terms of to realize
61:50 - what was the the the
61:53 - overarching um skills needed for it then
61:55 - I'm okay well I've got this skill of
61:58 - learning how to learn so I'm just going
62:00 - to create my own curriculum using online
62:02 - resources um that are kind of just a
62:05 - collation of I guess lists of of AI
62:09 - resources that I'm like these look like
62:11 - pretty good and I just put them in a
62:14 - just a blog post of basically I don't
62:16 - know let's say 10 resources the number
62:18 - is a bit arbitrary it's still on my
62:20 - website and I'm like okay over the next
62:23 - and I was publishing it publicly on M to
62:26 - basically no one but I wanted to just
62:30 - have a public record to keep me
62:32 - accountable so I'm like over the next X
62:35 - amount of time I'm going to go through
62:37 - these resources and get these skills and
62:39 - then I'll just get a job in machine
62:42 - learning that was my my thinking so you
62:44 - were using like your blog post and
62:47 - social media as a kind of an
62:48 - accountability mechanism to uh to like a
62:52 - commitment device essentially like I'm
62:54 - going to learn all this stuff and
62:55 - everybody's like good luck I'll look
62:57 - forward to hearing about the results of
62:59 - you learning all this stuff and then
63:00 - you're like oh damn I can't quit now
63:01 - everybody's waiting for me to share my
63:04 - results yeah well that's that's exact
63:06 - 100% that's exactly what I what I what I
63:09 - wanted to do and
63:11 - well one because yeah accountability two
63:13 - because I'm a very sort of I like
63:15 - interacting with other people who are
63:16 - interested in uh I think that's quite
63:18 - natural to just interact with people who
63:20 - are interested in what you're interested
63:21 - in yeah and uh this is 2017 so machine
63:25 - learning and Al is nowhere near as
63:27 - popular as it is now it was certainly
63:28 - gaining traction but C certainly when
63:31 - chat GPD came out everybody updated
63:32 - their LinkedIn profile HEI exactly or
63:35 - machine learning engine no longer yeah I
63:38 - had to update all my courses you know
63:40 - it's no longer teaching machine learning
63:41 - it's teaching Ai and machine learning um
63:45 - but uh but yeah the fundamental that
63:47 - isn't a marketing gimmick by the way
63:49 - that's the fun the fundamental
63:50 - Technologies are still the same between
63:52 - machine learning and ai ai is just a
63:54 - sort of yeah a bit more of a hyped up
63:56 - term at the moment um but yeah and it
64:00 - wasn't for a long time by the way a lot
64:01 - of people like so a little history
64:04 - lesson AI has like Winters and Summers
64:07 - right so like in the 1950s the US
64:10 - government's like we think we can create
64:12 - like human level intelligence within
64:14 - like 10 months or something with this
64:15 - team of like University researchers and
64:18 - of course that didn't work out right uh
64:20 - and then later they're like oh well now
64:22 - we've got an AI that can beat Gary Casp
64:24 - a chess you know blue IBM right or we've
64:27 - got Watson that can beat everybody at
64:29 - Jeopardy because it can hit the buzzer
64:30 - at superhuman rates before people can
64:32 - even hit their buzzer so they can't
64:33 - compete with it right like you know like
64:36 - like there all these like we we've had
64:38 - many yeah you're right I think it's
64:40 - almost 10 to 15 years we get yeah a new
64:44 - technology that's going to uh replace
64:46 - humans um so that's yeah that's very
64:49 - well you're right that's very well
64:50 - historically documented right back from
64:52 - like yeah the 20s almost um and then
64:55 - mechan now we can just get this to do it
64:58 - by itself without having a c underneath
64:59 - the the chess
65:01 - player right but uh sorry for like going
65:05 - off on a tangent I think it's that's
65:07 - important to have context yeah yeah cuz
65:09 - machine learning engineer for a while
65:11 - was like basically machine learning
65:13 - you'd say that instead of AI because I
65:16 - there was a stigma associated with AI
65:17 - because AI had disappointed so many
65:19 - people let people down you keep saying
65:21 - that like you know how 9000 is just
65:23 - around the corner the sky just around
65:25 - the corner and yet you know this AI can
65:27 - barely do anything you know so people
65:30 - like were oversold like and you could
65:32 - say to some extent there's so much hyper
65:33 - on AI uh that we being oversold right
65:36 - now but at the same time I use you know
65:38 - GPT 4 all the time like I use it several
65:41 - times a day there's something there
65:43 - there right uh it's not all just you
65:45 - know Sizzle and no steak this time it's
65:48 - there is real
65:50 - utility I totally agree yeah the same
65:52 - with me like I use AI tools uh
65:56 - I think now it's a lot more um customer
65:59 - facing as in like it's it's you can you
66:02 - can see what's happening with with AI
66:04 - tools now whereas in the background with
66:07 - predictive models so generative models
66:09 - the difference between predictive and AI
66:11 - uh sorry predictive Ai and generative AI
66:14 - predictive your sort of predicting is
66:16 - your email spam or not spam as in it's
66:18 - it's a set number of of classes um
66:21 - there's a a confined output whereas
66:24 - generative is kind of the out outut
66:25 - space is almost infinite it's still
66:27 - constra constrained to the distribution
66:30 - of of data that the model has seen but
66:33 - it's certainly a lot wider than just a a
66:35 - a unique set of of different labels so
66:38 - now um for the last I guess maybe 8 10
66:44 - years we've had predictive AI running
66:47 - behind the scenes um for credit card
66:50 - transactions for battery optimization
66:52 - for email classification for uh audio
66:56 - quality optimization but all these
66:58 - things are sort of behind the scenes
67:00 - whereas now I feel like the reason why
67:02 - it's it's getting a lot more traction
67:04 - now is because it's generative we can
67:06 - all interact with it with language with
67:08 - image and soon many more modalities yeah
67:14 - yeah it's super duper exciting and I I
67:16 - don't mean to like uh denigrate like the
67:20 - effort of all the AI engineering and all
67:21 - the breakthroughs and everything uh I
67:23 - just wanted to point out that like the
67:25 - machine machine learning term it's
67:26 - synonymous with AI right would you say
67:29 - that's that's accurate yes well that's
67:31 - yeah that's that's how I use it I guess
67:33 - you'd probably have people who who want
67:34 - to sort of Define it a bit more but like
67:37 - to me it's like there's one big umbrella
67:38 - up the top and that's AI artificial
67:41 - intelligence actually funny story about
67:43 - AI I told my grandfather um a few years
67:46 - ago when I was first studying Ai and he
67:49 - he thought it was artificial
67:50 - insemination which is
67:53 - um yes something related to
67:56 - impregnate cattles yeah artificially but
67:59 - no it's like no it's it's to do with uh
68:01 - technology so that just goes to show
68:03 - like how quickly technology can change
68:04 - that's like only two generations like my
68:07 - granddad to my parents to me and it's
68:09 - like all of a sudden we have totally new
68:11 - nures for for different paradigms uh
68:14 - anyway AI is up top for me at the big
68:17 - umbrella and then under that is machine
68:18 - learning and then under that is deep
68:21 - learning and so really if we're being
68:23 - really specific all of the AI that's
68:25 - currently generative AI is been powered
68:28 - by Deep learning um and so that's a
68:30 - subset of machine learning and machine
68:32 - learning is a subset of the field of AR
68:35 - okay yeah a great little kind of like
68:38 - pyramid if you want to think about those
68:40 - different terms and how they relate to
68:41 - one another one question a lot of people
68:43 - ask me is data science how is that
68:46 - related to
68:48 - AI yes so data science would be to me is
68:52 - is in I guess a part of AI as well
68:56 - um cuz AI is just I mean what's
68:58 - intelligence it's yeah it's pretty broad
69:01 - right so data science to me is using
69:04 - data to predict things so you're you're
69:06 - trying to formulate hypothesis and
69:09 - seeing if the the data falsifies it or
69:11 - proves it uh somewhat correct and so
69:15 - whereas data analytics is you're
69:17 - analyzing the past so data science to me
69:20 - is predicting the future data analytics
69:21 - analyze the past so what has happened
69:24 - that's a little Nuance that I sort of
69:25 - that helps me get through that and then
69:28 - within data science if you're trying to
69:29 - predict the future Based on data uh one
69:33 - of the techniques you can use is machine
69:35 - learning so you you get you write an
69:37 - algorithm that is going to sift through
69:41 - much more data than any one person could
69:43 - ever look at and try to form a
69:46 - predictive model so that given a similar
69:49 - source of data You can predict something
69:52 - in the future yeah now again it's all
69:55 - probably istic so it's not it's not a
69:57 - magic box um but it can sort of give you
70:01 - some insight into what it might be yeah
70:04 - and so for example like uh one
70:06 - application of you know predictive
70:08 - models would be figuring out what the
70:11 - next good move is in a game of Go uh you
70:15 - know the game with the stones for
70:17 - example like the the the Deep Mind
70:19 - alphao um algorithm uh AI system
70:23 - whatever you want to call it that was
70:25 - able to master this ancient Chinese game
70:27 - that's like 5,000 years old that has
70:31 - that is you know many many orders of
70:33 - magnitude more complicated than chess in
70:36 - terms of the possible moves you can make
70:38 - and the complexity of different
70:40 - strategies and everything like that and
70:42 - my understanding is they took a huge
70:45 - data set of previously played go games
70:48 - that have been recorded step by step
70:50 - just like with chess they've got like
70:51 - their notation to record like who move
70:54 - where and put stones we and essentially
70:57 - they use that as the training data and
70:59 - so initially like that whole model is to
71:01 - predict what the next like the highest
71:03 - confidence interval or like the highest
71:05 - you know expected value uh move is when
71:08 - you're putting a piece on the go board
71:10 - right um and
71:12 - so so we're talking about superhuman
71:15 - data like you could be a go encyclopedic
71:18 - you know go player you could potentially
71:20 - even have like some sort of neuro
71:22 - Divergent Quirk where you could
71:24 - literally remember full games of go but
71:27 - you wouldn't be able to like consume the
71:29 - entire Corpus of all the games that
71:30 - these AI systems can consume and
71:33 - eventually they stopped even feeding it
71:35 - trading data and they just like had it
71:36 - play against itself a whole lot for
71:39 - hundreds of years s simulated right it
71:42 - does not matter how smart you are you
71:44 - cannot play against yourself for
71:45 - hundreds of years because you're going
71:47 - to die all right so so yeah so when we
71:51 - talk about superhuman you know models
71:52 - and like these can do useful things that
71:54 - humans simply cannot do there are real
71:57 - world limitations on the exent of like
72:00 - human intelligence right uh so that
72:03 - that's what's so exciting about it for
72:05 - me like watching like the the go uh or
72:08 - watching like the AI that plays
72:09 - Starcraft against the best you know
72:11 - Korean Starcraft players and stuff like
72:13 - that and like just the applications of
72:14 - these to see interesting things that
72:16 - come out uh that that I think is like
72:20 - that is what really gets me hyped up uh
72:22 - as somebody who enjoys games and stuff
72:24 - well the StarCraft one to me is is
72:27 - really fascinating cuz that in requires
72:30 - like team interaction versus like uh the
72:34 - go one is obviously very impressive but
72:36 - it's it's sort of you your your solo and
72:39 - your your board state is is influenced
72:42 - sure you're influenced by an opposition
72:44 - but you're largely your actions
72:46 - influence the board State as well but
72:48 - then you have like um uh what was it
72:51 - called or DOTA sorry or Starcraft what
72:54 - where you have a team of five versus
72:56 - another team of five and it's like okay
72:58 - now you have multiple people influencing
73:01 - multiple things and like these people if
73:04 - you if you're like a a newcomer you you
73:07 - could play Dota or Starcraft for 5 years
73:10 - but then someone who's an expert at it
73:12 - just comes and wipes the floor with you
73:14 - like and you have zero chance but then
73:16 - these AIS can can train for a month in
73:20 - computer simulator time and then they're
73:21 - going up against the world champions who
73:23 - are so far removed from the average
73:26 - player it's it's ridiculous but then the
73:29 - the AI is catching up in in a month of
73:31 - simulation yeah yeah I mean it
73:34 - really it it's probably a foregone
73:37 - conclusion that we have artificial
73:38 - general intelligence given like the
73:40 - constraints of just the human mind and
73:42 - the fact that like we're working with
73:43 - something that evolved to like find
73:45 - calories and like avoid predators and
73:47 - stuff and they're working with like
73:49 - basically the fruits of like the finest
73:52 - engineering Minds from the past you know
73:55 - 100 years and then all the
73:56 - mathematicians and philosophers and
73:58 - everybody else that was also kind of
73:59 - like seminal in in creating the uh the
74:03 - Corpus upon which like those
74:05 - Technologies sit upon right like yeah I
74:08 - mean I would be really amazed if we
74:09 - didn't have systems that were way
74:11 - smarter than human beings within the
74:13 - next 50 or 100 years in some Dimensions
74:16 - I'm I'm not sure that we'll have uh you
74:18 - know what are your thoughts on uh so so
74:21 - we can talk a lot more about AI cuz one
74:23 - of the things I want to talk about
74:25 - is how should somebody approach learning
74:29 - these things because frankly I think
74:31 - everybody who's interested in technology
74:33 - should learn about these things um and
74:35 - but the question is how do they go about
74:37 - doing it you just did that what would be
74:40 - your high level advice to people who
74:43 - want to just start let's say they just
74:44 - know a little bit about programming
74:46 - technology they know how to use you know
74:48 - a browser maybe they know a little bit
74:50 - of like a scripting language like python
74:52 - maybe they've used Microsoft Access or
74:54 - even SQL or something like like that so
74:55 - they have like basic knowledge of like
74:58 - how to get stuff done with computers how
75:00 - do they go from there to where you are
75:02 - in terms of building your own models and
75:05 - and uh you know getting things done with
75:07 - these
75:09 - tools well I feel like yeah there's
75:12 - almost an unlimited amount of approaches
75:14 - but I if you're just let's say you're
75:16 - just comfortable using a computer but
75:18 - you want to you know you want to get
75:19 - into using AI stuff I would say that the
75:21 - the the tri entry array the way that I
75:23 - did it was just relentlessly follow your
75:27 - curiosity and it sounds like trite but
75:29 - it's like that's just going to fuel you
75:31 - through like I had to do it in a I
75:34 - realized that my I needed a sort of
75:36 - structured curiosity following uh that's
75:38 - why I created my own uh rough path of
75:42 - like courses to follow to build a um a
75:45 - foundational knowledge and then after
75:46 - that I just once I'd had the
75:48 - foundational knowledge I just went and
75:50 - go I'm going to just relentlessly follow
75:52 - this so that was my path and I feel like
75:55 - that's obviously unbiased but I feel
75:57 - like if you're if you don't want to go
75:59 - to to college or back to school or
76:02 - whatnot the the resources on the
76:03 - internet are the best you're going to
76:05 - get especially in this new field well
76:06 - not new field but in the current climate
76:08 - of AI the universities and colleges just
76:12 - don't catch up as fast as the the field
76:14 - moves however that does not to say if
76:16 - you're already involved in a computer
76:18 - science or mathematic or some sort of
76:20 - technology related or any actually any
76:23 - related um uh degree or something at
76:26 - school because these Technologies are so
76:28 - wide ranging uh I am actually of a big
76:32 - uh like in big favor of we need people
76:35 - who are well trained in
76:38 - non-technological backgrounds to pick up
76:40 - these skills so that it's not just a
76:43 - bunch of computer nerds running the the
76:45 - AI world we need people who are
76:47 - well-versed in many different fields uh
76:50 - offering Insight because what what a lot
76:52 - of Engineers and I'm guilty of this and
76:54 - people who are in Tech uh sort of one
76:57 - downside is that they again they build
76:59 - Solutions because that's what they like
77:00 - to do they're Engineers but then the
77:03 - solutions don't map to the actual real
77:06 - world like um like say for example a
77:09 - healthcare solution um was built by
77:11 - Engineers but then you you start to talk
77:14 - to nurses and people who actually
77:15 - provide Healthcare and they say that's
77:18 - just not going to work because we have
77:20 - to I remember in my machine learning job
77:23 - perfect case of this is that we were
77:25 - before uh transcription got really quite
77:30 - good like as it is now you can download
77:32 - a model from hugging face and you can
77:34 - get almost Flawless transcription at
77:36 - least definitely usable transcription uh
77:40 - we were building models to transcribe
77:42 - doctor's notes um as in so you go to a
77:45 - doctor's appointment and instead of the
77:46 - doctor there typing on the keyboard uh
77:49 - while you're talking it would just
77:50 - automatically write down what you were
77:53 - speaking so you had a record there yeah
77:55 - so we're building this system the model
77:56 - worked pretty good um at least good for
77:59 - 2018 standards and then we went to
78:03 - deliver it to the the system and we kind
78:06 - of I was speaking to the business Dev or
78:09 - the business person that was running it
78:11 - and their whole goal was to they they
78:13 - found out that on average a doctor
78:15 - spends 5 minutes during each appointment
78:18 - to type notes and they wanted to make
78:22 - that basically zero and that way a
78:25 - doctor could see like three more
78:27 - patients a day if you add that up and
78:30 - just and just in my head I'm like sort
78:31 - of okay that works fantastic from an
78:34 - economic standpoint but I'm like why do
78:37 - people go to the doctor in the first
78:38 - place I actually asked that in the
78:40 - meeting and uh I kind of got looked at
78:43 - looked at like very like what are you
78:45 - talking about like what what of course
78:46 - people go to a doctor cuz they're sick
78:48 - and I'm like yeah they might be sick but
78:51 - they're also going for empathy and to to
78:53 - chat with another human being
78:55 - and if we're just basically going oh
78:58 - yeah you sa 5 minutes so now you can see
78:59 - three more patients a day it's just like
79:01 - a a factory line of like people in and
79:04 - out maybe that extra 5 minutes the
79:06 - doctor could actually talk to the person
79:08 - of like how's your family how's your
79:10 - how's your wife how's your kids um all
79:13 - that sort of stuff and like get to know
79:15 - the person and uh again it can't be
79:18 - proven in like medical terms but the
79:23 - spiritual sort of side of me feels like
79:25 - that that is almost as healing as like
79:28 - prescribing a a drug or a treatment of
79:30 - just someone caring about your problem
79:32 - the whole notion of bedside manner from
79:34 - your doctor essentially like they they
79:36 - that they care that they're not just
79:38 - that you're not just numbers on a chart
79:39 - that you're not just like this graph or
79:41 - this uh scan that they're looking at oh
79:44 - blah blah blah blah blah like they
79:45 - actually look at you they actually
79:46 - connect with you I mean that's like you
79:48 - know I've changed doctors a lot over the
79:51 - years and that's one of the most common
79:52 - reasons like it doesn't seem like they
79:54 - even give a damn about me like I'm just
79:56 - another you know appointment and they
79:57 - got to dash out the door to the next one
79:59 - they don't even bother sitting down you
80:01 - know like those are all flags for me red
80:03 - flags that I need to find a different
80:05 - you know primary care physician so yeah
80:08 - uh and and those are the kinds of things
80:09 - that you learn from being out in the
80:12 - field you know not building The Chariot
80:14 - behind closed doors but actually going
80:15 - out there but but was that the lesson of
80:18 - what you were trying to tell or or was
80:19 - it something different
80:21 - like well that's what I was saying it's
80:23 - like don't if you want to get into the
80:25 - yeah so the initial question was yeah
80:28 - how to best get into it and again I
80:29 - don't have the best I only really have
80:31 - my uh experience and my experience is uh
80:35 - there are a lot of things that you'll
80:36 - see in the in the tech field that are
80:37 - sort of almost too techy as in like
80:41 - you'll you'll you can yes there are
80:43 - fundamental skills that you you are
80:45 - going to have to learn which is uh
80:47 - programming in some sense and the
80:49 - language of AI at the moment is Python
80:51 - programming language you you basically
80:52 - can't go wrong if you start with that um
80:55 - and then writing C A lot of people tell
80:57 - me oh I'm scared of the math of AI and
81:00 - ML and uh it is all math I'm not going
81:04 - to talk away from that it is writing
81:06 - computer code to trigger math at scale
81:09 - that's that's like AI algorithms in a
81:11 - nutshell however these days I deal with
81:16 - 99% code rather than than math so I'm I
81:20 - I'm not an expert in math I don't have a
81:21 - background I don't have mathematics
81:22 - degree but I can write um computer code
81:26 - to to run that math and the computer is
81:28 - going to implement that for me and so
81:30 - I'm more interested in the Practical
81:31 - side of writing the code to to implement
81:33 - things then U doing the research into
81:37 - the mathematical foundations of the
81:38 - algorithm um to find new algorithms I'm
81:42 - more interested in applying existing
81:44 - techniques to things that I find
81:46 - interesting rather than Reinventing
81:48 - completely new techniques so there's two
81:51 - kind of sides to it a lot a lot gets uh
81:54 - in the there's kind of the the AI and
81:56 - machine learning research and I would
81:58 - say if you want to go into that and be a
82:01 - researcher um you're going to need to to
82:04 - learn the mathematics inside and out
82:06 - because that's what the the researchers
82:08 - doing and and let's say if you want to
82:10 - do research is that like you should just
82:12 - stay at a university generally or best
82:16 - yes that would be the best path for
82:18 - again you can there is no the internet
82:20 - there is no limits there's a website
82:22 - called archive which is ax X i.org which
82:27 - basically all the new machine learning
82:28 - research gets published to that and it's
82:30 - free so truly if you just wanted to sit
82:34 - at home and you you you have hours per
82:37 - day to read through archive you can just
82:39 - create your own self-study um like
82:42 - Facebook Google uh MIT Stanford all
82:47 - publish their research papers to Archive
82:50 - and then the code will be on GitHub so
82:52 - if you want to just really just find
82:54 - your own self way and then there's
82:57 - communities on Discord these days which
82:58 - are like basically all of those
83:00 - resources are completely free so if you
83:02 - have the discipline to go through that
83:04 - yourself um by all means but if you're
83:07 - just getting started you're at college
83:10 - already you're studying a technology
83:11 - thing mathematics whatnot you want to go
83:13 - to research uh I would stick with that
83:16 - path but then also just just always
83:19 - remember that um there are resources
83:22 - outside of college that are very ible um
83:26 - so that's a research side of things but
83:29 - practicality wise I would say if you
83:32 - come from a different background that's
83:33 - also really cool because now you have a
83:36 - different set of knowledge uh that you
83:38 - can sort of start to see what AI is
83:40 - capable of and go how can I apply this
83:43 - to my current field and that's kind of
83:45 - what what I I'm doing now as in I
83:48 - studied um food science and nutrition at
83:50 - University and now my brother and I are
83:52 - working on a startup called nutrify
83:54 - which is uh at the moment it's a like a
83:57 - Pokédex for food so or Shazam for food
84:00 - you take a photo of food and it will
84:02 - tell you about it so it uses computer
84:04 - vision and then maps that to nutrition
84:05 - data and then you can create a food
84:07 - diary get nutritional insights from from
84:10 - that so that's my practical standpoint
84:13 - is I have studied food science and
84:15 - nutrition and now I've kind of got
84:17 - versed in AI Technologies I'm trying to
84:20 - marry the two yeah um so that's kind of
84:24 - the between like research is is the
84:26 - Academic Way of like um you're just
84:28 - trying to push the field forward in
84:30 - terms of um studying new algorithms
84:33 - building new algorithms going through
84:35 - research papers and trying to collate
84:36 - the best things and again it's a very
84:39 - big overlap too with with the Practical
84:41 - side of things of building a solution
84:43 - that other people can actually use but I
84:45 - would say the the building the Practical
84:47 - solution that other people can use is a
84:49 - lot more code heavy versus the research
84:53 - is still Codey but also there's a lot
84:55 - more math involved yeah so like you know
84:59 - free camp for example we're teaching
85:00 - Applied Mathematics and it's always got
85:02 - to focus on okay how do you actually
85:03 - implement this in Python uh so if you
85:06 - look at the the algebra course that we
85:08 - published a few months ago and we've got
85:10 - a pre-calculus course coming in a couple
85:12 - months and we're going to have all the
85:14 - engineering math that you would get at
85:15 - like an you know at a big top computer
85:19 - science program here in the US would be
85:20 - like MIT Caltech Stanford uh but um um
85:24 - what we're doing is instead of focusing
85:26 - on like okay let's draw out all these
85:28 - formulas on the Whiteboard and stuff
85:29 - like that you still kind of learn that
85:31 - but it's all about okay let's implement
85:33 - this in code because any mathematical
85:35 - expression can be implemented in code uh
85:39 - right like you see that summation symbol
85:41 - the big scary I think it's like an
85:43 - Epsilon I can't remember all the Greek
85:44 - letters but like that's just a for
85:47 - right um yeah so like and like all these
85:51 - different uh variables you pull in and
85:52 - stuff like order of operations all stuff
85:54 - that's all code right you can Implement
85:56 - math in code and python as you said is
85:59 - like the the language dour people aren't
86:02 - using r as much or Julia Lang or these
86:05 - other computational languages I mean you
86:07 - can certainly use that but you can't go
86:09 - wrong with python there's like python
86:11 - libraries for pretty much everything
86:12 - right that you need to do in machine
86:14 - learning yeah and I feel like yeah the
86:17 - the language of AI these days is is or
86:20 - the framework of AI and deep learning is
86:22 - pi torch and the pi is python so um yeah
86:27 - pytorch is a framework for deep learning
86:28 - and it's all all accessible in Python
86:30 - you can WR you can write machine
86:33 - learning code in basically any
86:35 - programming language but uh python is is
86:40 - where you want to be if you're starting
86:42 - from zero and learning to to program
86:44 - like today or learning to code I would
86:46 - 100% recommend
86:48 - python yeah and you know pytorch like so
86:52 - that's like the Facebook open source
86:54 - project uh for machine learning and then
86:57 - there's also tensorflow which we have
86:58 - courses on both uh which is also another
87:01 - python uh machine learning library
87:04 - that's created by Google and you know
87:07 - all these tools are like open source
87:09 - they're free you don't have to pay for
87:10 - mat lab or you know like a site license
87:13 - or or like a lot of these other tools
87:15 - that are frankly pretty expensive like
87:18 - like
87:19 - uh and the python ecosystem is just
87:22 - amazing so yeah I I think it's cool that
87:24 - you do so much and you have tutorials on
87:26 - so many of these tools in Python uh you
87:29 - know your most popular video ever I
87:31 - think is a pytorch video and one of your
87:32 - other most popular videos is a tensor
87:34 - flow these are like yeah 10hour videos
87:37 - 25h hour videos that are literally in a
87:41 - day yeah literally a day like just drink
87:44 - drink drink your energy drink and and
87:47 - get your crack your knuckles and let's
87:49 - let's do some uh machine learning right
87:52 - so I want to fire off lot of questions
87:54 - so just to recap what you're were saying
87:56 - because you had so many insights there
87:58 - and I I want to try to like break it
87:59 - down for everybody listening so there's
88:01 - the applied side the engineering side
88:03 - and then there's the science side if you
88:05 - want to be an
88:07 - engineer start engineering right start
88:10 - grabbing tools off the shelf and start
88:11 - applying them to problems if you want to
88:13 - be a scientist there's something to be
88:15 - said for being in the Ivory Tower and
88:17 - going to just get a PhD but there are
88:20 - sites like AR archive I'm not sure
88:23 - exactly howc
88:24 - yeah like uh I think it's like from a
88:26 - Cornell or something like that like I'll
88:27 - link to that in the show notes we're
88:28 - going to put links to a lot of stuff we
88:30 - talk about in the show notes uh in the
88:32 - video description if you're watching
88:33 - this on YouTube but uh one of the
88:36 - interesting things that I think you said
88:39 - is whatever domain expertise you already
88:42 - have in your case nutrition you can
88:44 - bring that from wherever you are
88:45 - learning to code is kind of a skill that
88:48 - you layer on top of your existing domain
88:50 - expertise like I'm a teacher I was a
88:53 - school director right like uh learning
88:56 - the code for me was just a skill that
88:58 - would allow me to get new things done as
89:00 - a teacher right like free C Camp is
89:03 - partially like I'm I'm just one of many
89:05 - many many people who've worked on free C
89:07 - Camp but it's like an expression of my
89:08 - interest in education and you know apply
89:12 - like applying that using coding right
89:14 - same thing with like learning a foreign
89:16 - language you're just allowing yourself
89:17 - to go and do whatever it is you you do
89:19 - if you're a doctor and you learn Spanish
89:21 - bam now you can go to like Latin America
89:23 - and help people right right if there's
89:24 - like an earthquake there you can
89:25 - potentially go down there and be a
89:26 - relief worker or something like that
89:28 - right so it's just another tool through
89:30 - which you can express your expertise and
89:33 - and so I think it's really interesting
89:35 - that you have this domain expertise that
89:36 - you already built up and you're still in
89:38 - the space you're still building you know
89:39 - health and nutrition Wellness type tools
89:42 - but you're applying the machine learning
89:43 - skills that you have to get those things
89:46 - done that's so
89:47 - cool yeah so uh I want to just fire off
89:51 - a lot of really quick questions so thing
89:54 - that like people always say to me is
89:56 - like oh I want to do machine learning
89:57 - but I don't have the GPU or whatever
90:00 - like uh it used to be like coding I'm
90:02 - like oh cool like I used like a a
90:04 - netbook which was like 300 bucks it had
90:06 - 2 gigabytes of RAM and like I used that
90:09 - for like two or three years when I first
90:10 - started learning the code learning the
90:11 - code technically you don't really need a
90:13 - lot of computational power you're just
90:15 - you know writing loops and like building
90:16 - algorithms and data structures and stuff
90:18 - but with machine learning you do kind of
90:20 - need some Hardware to get somewhere
90:22 - right
90:24 - yeah so I would say yeah if
90:28 - you're okay let's let's just talk from
90:30 - from beginner level like if you're if
90:31 - you're just getting into programming
90:34 - uh any any modern laptop will do a
90:37 - MacBook Air or um I'm not quite I've
90:41 - been using Apple for a while now so I'm
90:42 - not quite familiar with the the the most
90:44 - recent Windows laptops but um anyone of
90:48 - those will do so you can you can get
90:50 - started learning all the basic sort of
90:51 - stuff but then as you no I don't want I
90:54 - don't want to downplay it and say that
90:55 - it's basic you can you can get quite far
90:58 - using uh a standard desktop machine but
91:01 - then if you want to start getting into
91:03 - more and more advanced um using bigger
91:05 - models training your own uh
91:07 - state-of-the-art AI models then that's
91:10 - where you're going to need more compute
91:11 - power um so for example I do 90% of my
91:16 - work day to-day on a M1 MacBook Pro but
91:20 - then when I train deep learning models
91:22 - and so sorry if there's a car starting
91:24 - that's my housemate leaving um when I
91:27 - train deep learning models I I write the
91:31 - code on my MacBook Pro but then it it
91:32 - sends it to I've got a a PC in my closet
91:36 - with a big GPU in there and it trains
91:38 - the model on there and then I take the
91:41 - model from that and I deploy it to a
91:44 - smartphone in the case of nutrify but
91:46 - then if you want to go even higher to
91:48 - build something like chat gbt you're
91:50 - going to need uh a warehouse for the of
91:54 - computers and so there's there's quite a
91:56 - large scale there however if you're I I
92:00 - I tend to towards like all my courses
92:02 - are beginner friendly right so I tend to
92:05 - I I like I'm a big advocate for the
92:07 - little guy you know the person hacking
92:09 - around on their their computer and
92:10 - trying to build something that can scale
92:12 - to a million people if you really wanted
92:14 - it to and so uh I don't have access to
92:17 - thousands of gpus like meta Facebook
92:20 - Microsoft oh meta and Facebook the same
92:22 - people anyway I don't have access to a
92:24 - warehouse of computers so I'm mainly
92:27 - interested in and the field this is a
92:29 - little bit kind of um it's something you
92:32 - kind I I don't realize it cuz I'm so
92:33 - embedded in the field but it's something
92:35 - that you it's a really big blessing uh
92:37 - when you get into the field is that a
92:39 - lot of there's such an open culture in
92:43 - uh machine learning like most as I said
92:45 - most of the research papers um are
92:48 - published free to read which is actually
92:50 - quite different to a lot of other fields
92:52 - and a lot of the the research papers
92:54 - come with the code so here's the code
92:56 - you can run on your own computer to
92:58 - implement it and then finally here is
93:01 - the trained model that you can uh use on
93:04 - your own computer so you may not
93:07 - necessarily and the benefit of this is
93:09 - that the trained model they may have
93:10 - been trained by researchers using uh
93:13 - let's say 10 or eight Nvidia gpus that
93:16 - are worth $220,000 each so it's $160,000
93:20 - machine it's trained for 3 days on that
93:21 - machine they're going to release that
93:23 - model for you so you don't have to
93:24 - repeat the training you've already got
93:27 - the finished product and you can apply
93:28 - that on your machine now whether you'll
93:31 - be able to run that at scale is another
93:33 - question so there's kind of this is
93:35 - quite a bit of rabbit hole but I'll just
93:37 - keep going with it is that what I'm
93:40 - saying is you can have a a consumer
93:41 - level machine and then run these models
93:44 - that larger Enterprises have released
93:47 - and then you can start to build with
93:48 - things like that and so one of the
93:51 - biggest expenses in compute power for a
93:53 - machine learning model or deep learning
93:54 - model is the pre-training so training it
93:57 - and that the pre-training is the p in
93:59 - GPT so pre-training that can often take
94:02 - weeks and months for some models um
94:05 - literally weeks and months of time so
94:07 - you'll have in the case of GPT uh I
94:10 - don't think they release the exact
94:11 - numbers but I feel like having a
94:14 - computer like a th000 gpus or maybe more
94:17 - 10,000 running simultaneously for 3
94:20 - months is not an understatement so that
94:22 - just goes to show you billions of
94:24 - dollars to train these models in some
94:26 - cases we're not yeah we'll be in the
94:28 - billions soon um I think the billion
94:31 - dollar training run will probably happen
94:32 - in the next 3 years or so but um
94:35 - definitely multi multi-millions like
94:37 - we're talk I think Lama 2 from Facebook
94:40 - was like a $10 million training run um
94:42 - and so then now we can use uh with
94:45 - Frameworks like mlx from from Apple we
94:49 - can run those models on MacBooks so
94:52 - that's that's really cool
94:54 - and then you have other tools like if
94:56 - you're running on a consumer machine you
94:58 - can go to uh Google collab which is a
95:01 - free resource basically like Google Docs
95:03 - but um for computing and you can run
95:07 - python code you can access uh free gpus
95:11 - so a GPU is a graphical processing unit
95:13 - that is very good at doing parallel
95:16 - computations which is what you need to
95:17 - do in machine learning you need to run
95:21 - numerical calculations and you need to
95:22 - do a lot of them to find patterns in
95:24 - data and so gpus just happen to be
95:27 - really good at doing many computations
95:30 - simultaneously so you can find those
95:32 - patterns faster and
95:34 - so um Frameworks like pytorch allow you
95:38 - to build models load models and you got
95:42 - hugging face Transformers free open
95:44 - source Library you can load pre-trained
95:46 - models into your Google coab instance
95:48 - and then start to build from there so as
95:51 - a practical example um um the other day
95:54 - like my friend works for an insurance
95:56 - company and um one of their big problems
96:00 - is
96:01 - H I'm getting fireworks on my thing your
96:05 - Apple gestures thing turned on for
96:06 - anybody who listening to the audio
96:08 - version you have to turn that off if you
96:10 - use an apple if you do double thumbs up
96:12 - and you have it turned on which it is by
96:14 - default you'll see like these fireworks
96:17 - so I didn't even know just triggered
96:18 - that that's hilarious it's a delightful
96:20 - way to learn about it in real time sorry
96:23 - just had fireworks behind me yeah so you
96:25 - were talking about your friend at the
96:26 - insurance C yes so um he was using uh
96:33 - Google collab to do some research on um
96:37 - the insurance document so as you can
96:39 - imagine insurance companies have a lot
96:40 - of files and a lot of sort of uh
96:43 - information cases to dig through and
96:45 - then he was using Google collab to
96:47 - download a pre-trained language model to
96:50 - um basically read through email threads
96:52 - to to find find like who was at fault
96:55 - who was um uh the person making the
96:58 - claim uh what was the amount what was
97:00 - the date and then structure that data
97:02 - from uh from just raw text of the email
97:05 - thread which is kind of very tedious to
97:07 - go through then would have the language
97:08 - model automatically turn that into Json
97:11 - which is a structured data pattern which
97:13 - is uh much easier to navigate so that's
97:16 - just like one one of many many examples
97:20 - of how someone from like an insurance
97:23 - like
97:24 - uh field not not exactly fully related
97:26 - to AI can start to use AI tools to to
97:30 - help them for their
97:32 - workflow yeah I mean just like software
97:34 - in general like anything you're doing
97:35 - that is tedious that you can describe
97:37 - really well historically you wouldn't
97:38 - necessarily be able to do that you might
97:39 - be able to describe in great detail
97:42 - exactly how you look at different photos
97:45 - and determine whether they need
97:47 - moderator attention or not right like if
97:49 - you let's say you work in one of
97:51 - Facebook's many like moderator kind of
97:53 - like
97:53 - data center or call center type places
97:57 - uh where you're like going through and
97:58 - like checking every photo that uh
98:00 - somebody has flagged on Facebook for
98:01 - example like you might be able to very
98:04 - accurately describe using words how you
98:06 - would go about determining whether a
98:07 - photo was inappropriate and needed to be
98:09 - removed but it was very hard to teach a
98:11 - computer to do that until now now it's
98:15 - like we've got like so much more
98:17 - powerful models and it's just like that
98:19 - that like kind of evolutionary leap and
98:21 - so now now like I would never have
98:23 - trusted a computer to like look at a
98:25 - thread of emails and figure out who was
98:27 - at fault or like pull out all these San
98:29 - details because human language is so
98:30 - complicated and everything like five
98:32 - years ago I wouldn't just thought oh
98:34 - yeah like I'm not even going to attempt
98:35 - to write that kind of program it would
98:37 - just not work yeah even even two years
98:40 - ago like this is this is really sort of
98:42 - new stuff that we're kind of um yeah
98:45 - we're still figuring out the the exact
98:47 - use cases that um all the the new tools
98:51 - generative AI there's like no real it's
98:53 - not an understatement to say that yeah
98:55 - in the last two years the it went from
98:57 - basically not working to working really
99:00 - really well so and of course it's still
99:03 - like there's it's not perfect but I mean
99:05 - that's the nature of machine learning
99:07 - it's it's probabilistic it's never going
99:08 - to be 100% perfect um but it can
99:12 - definitely be useful yeah and and that
99:15 - is why all the hoopla all the hubub
99:18 - about AI all of a sudden is because it's
99:21 - it's not just hype uh there have been
99:25 - some major breakthroughs that you and I
99:28 - are using like free Camp uses AI like
99:30 - everybody I know who's a software
99:32 - engineer is like learning how to work
99:33 - these into the workflows it's a new tool
99:35 - in your toolbox that you can pull out
99:37 - for novel types of problems that before
99:40 - you just had to you know use regx and
99:42 - pre essentially or something like that
99:44 - right I I feel like yeah I feel like now
99:47 - is I I get a question quite often is
99:49 - like should I even start now because of
99:51 - AI just like coming in and just changing
99:54 - everything and I I was I'm a big
99:56 - Advocate um of like now is again it
100:00 - sounds TR but it's like now is like one
100:03 - of the best times ever to learn to code
100:04 - because the tools are so helpful um and
100:08 - like there's a difference like there's a
100:09 - kind of a niche difference between like
100:11 - coding and programming like I would say
100:14 - uh like programming to me is just
100:16 - thinking like a lot of my time I think
100:19 - if if people get the um the idea of like
100:22 - if you're a software engineer you just
100:23 - spend all day um writing code I would
100:27 - say now majority like I do write a lot
100:31 - of code however uh I use AI tools such
100:35 - as GitHub co-pilot to write a lot of the
100:37 - boilerplate but for the stuff that I
100:39 - have to think out um that's mostly
100:42 - thought of like I've got a a text
100:44 - document here where I've just been
100:45 - collecting ideas on a workflow that i'
100:47 - I'd like to be implementing and I've
100:49 - been refining that workflow in my head
100:51 - not not writing any any code yet and
100:54 - then go okay that might work that might
100:55 - work and then I write the code to test
100:57 - the workflow and all the boilerplate
101:00 - stuff is is is helped with AI tools and
101:02 - what I mean by boiler plate that's
101:04 - another term in the industry of like
101:06 - really tedious stuff that you kind of um
101:08 - you're not really thinking about when
101:09 - you write it but you have it has to be
101:11 - there to get started so it's like the I
101:15 - guess the if you're writing an
101:16 - assignment it's like the the structure
101:18 - of the assignment it like needs to needs
101:20 - to be there to start but it doesn't
101:22 - really take much thought but it is
101:24 - tedious to get and so AI tools now are
101:27 - very good at that but for like specific
101:30 - workflows um that still requires
101:34 - programming which is very thoughtful um
101:38 - and a lot of the time is is a lot of the
101:40 - code actually you'll write 1,000 lines
101:42 - of code but then you'll delete 700
101:45 - because um you don't actually need them
101:47 - and it's more efficient the way you're
101:49 - doing it the first time is really rough
101:51 - um that's really big thing in machine
101:52 - learning
101:53 - is you'll you'll write like a thousand
101:57 - different experiments and maybe 10 of
101:59 - them work quite well and you'll start to
102:01 - pursue those so a lot of my day is spent
102:04 - yes writing code but now ai tools write
102:07 - a lot of that Baseline stuff for me um I
102:10 - still know I could if I didn't have the
102:12 - AI tool this is another important point
102:14 - is that if I didn't have the AI tool I'd
102:16 - still be able to write it I would just
102:18 - it would just um take me longer uh if
102:22 - that makes sense
102:23 - so um to the people who yeah who ask who
102:28 - ask me and this is what I reply with is
102:30 - that it's it's actually a really great
102:31 - time to start learning to code because
102:34 - the the the really big hurdle when
102:36 - you're starting is that it's you have to
102:37 - learn you're learning a new language and
102:40 - then um like it's like learning Chinese
102:42 - learning Japanese but then once once you
102:45 - get over that that big hurdle of the
102:47 - momentum of like just learning the the
102:50 - syntax of like what goes where where it
102:52 - goes then you can start to okay you
102:54 - don't have to use such a big thought
102:56 - process just to get the syntax out you
102:58 - can write the thing and keep going uh
103:01 - and so AI tools are really really good
103:03 - like chat GPT Gemini I mean there's half
103:07 - a dozen of these chat Bots now um at
103:10 - writing fundamental python code and so
103:14 - if you have an error in Python which is
103:15 - the language of machine learning they're
103:17 - incredibly helpful for debugging it um
103:20 - and almost instantaneously whereas in
103:22 - the the past you'd have to really quite
103:26 - get good at searching and reading
103:28 - documentation and whatnot that's that's
103:30 - not to say that's not still a valuable
103:31 - skill but especially for that just that
103:34 - initial hurdle of learning something
103:36 - completely new they're really really
103:38 - good for that and then once you've got
103:40 - some momentum you can start to apply
103:42 - your skills there's always going to be
103:45 - that sort of um uh time where you need
103:50 - you you can't necessarily use a chat
103:52 - assistant or whatnot or an AI tool is
103:53 - that you're going to basically have to
103:55 - delve into the documentation of
103:56 - something that's new and hasn't been
103:58 - around for a while and you need to to
104:00 - just
104:02 - basically whack your head up against the
104:04 - wall and figure it out like take some
104:07 - time um yeah I mean there there aren't
104:09 - really any shortcuts like you said like
104:11 - all the stuff you're talking about doing
104:13 - you're still the problem solver you're
104:15 - just using these tools as a way to solve
104:17 - the problem but if if you look at the
104:19 - code is like very succinct instructions
104:22 - for what to do like yes the machine is
104:25 - very good at like figuring out like from
104:28 - its massive Corpus like co-pilot has I
104:30 - don't know hundreds of thousands
104:32 - millions of code examples from python
104:34 - for implementing similar types of
104:36 - functions or something that it can draw
104:37 - from to create uh similar type boiler
104:41 - plate uh but at the end of the day like
104:43 - figuring out what work needs to be done
104:46 - and like the the high level thinking you
104:48 - still need human intellect to do that
104:51 - and I don't think that's going to change
104:52 - dramatically anytime soon like I always
104:55 - say this like you watch Star Trek and
104:57 - the computer doesn't just do everything
104:58 - it doesn't just run the ship
104:59 - everything's done like the humans don't
105:01 - do anything no the humans are doing lots
105:03 - of things they're figuring out where to
105:04 - go they're figuring out what is
105:05 - important uh they're asking questions of
105:08 - the computer they're they're creating
105:09 - new programs within the computer to get
105:11 - things done and of course that's just a
105:13 - science fiction show written in like
105:14 - the' 60s 7s 90s um you know but I think
105:19 - it's it's a pretty accurate assessment
105:21 - of like where technology ultimately
105:23 - going it's just yet stronger tools yet
105:26 - longer levers for us to use to get more
105:28 - work done as empowered individuals so
105:32 - yeah I just want to quickly second what
105:34 - you just said Daniel I think it's more
105:36 - important than ever that people learn
105:38 - how to code and uh people worry like oh
105:41 - but like what if you know the jobs are
105:45 - taken by technology like the people the
105:47 - nutritionists who know how to use
105:48 - machine learning the nutritionists who
105:50 - know how to to get things done with
105:52 - computers are going to be much more
105:54 - competitive than the ones that just
105:56 - throw up their hands in Despair and say
105:58 - oh I don't need to learn that stuff or
105:59 - I'm not smart enough to learn that stuff
106:00 - right same thing with teachers who learn
106:02 - technology same thing with um you know
106:06 - doctors who learn how to use these
106:07 - Technologies like everybody in society
106:09 - can really benefit from layering this
106:11 - skill set on top of their domain
106:13 - expertise and on top of you know their
106:15 - profession their trade so um couple just
106:19 - fire questions man I just want to like
106:21 - make good use of your time first of all
106:22 - thanks again for waking up super duper
106:24 - early right what time is it over there
106:27 - uh it's 8:51 now but I was yeah it was
106:29 - uh I know we had a couple of technical
106:31 - delays on my end but it was um yeah
106:34 - starting nice and early 6:00 a.m. 6:30
106:37 - so Google collab you mentioned that I
106:39 - just want to say if you use the free
106:40 - Camp curriculum we make heavy use of
106:42 - Google collab uh for our machine
106:44 - learning section amazing Tool uh it's
106:48 - basically just an implementation of
106:49 - jupyter notebook which is a popular open
106:51 - source python yeah that's correct um and
106:55 - then uh I've been taking detailed notes
106:56 - as you you talk one other thing that uh
106:59 - I think is is kind of cool that uh you
107:02 - know you've created this like I don't
107:04 - know have you done it every year but
107:05 - like the state of AI like what you need
107:07 - to learn in 2022 you know like like you
107:10 - create these comprehensive learning
107:11 - paths have you created one for 2024 yet
107:14 - not it's not every year because I didn't
107:17 - want to um one it took me a long time to
107:19 - do but another one is like it almost
107:21 - like because it was changing so fast the
107:24 - last couple of years I uh I've held off
107:27 - on my most recent one so I think
107:29 - um I don't want to make promises but
107:32 - there's there's like I've definitely got
107:34 - a note of like uh research and and
107:37 - whatnot of what I'd like to include in
107:38 - the next version and I think this may be
107:40 - the you the 2024 2025 and for the next
107:44 - couple of years and whatnot onwards um
107:48 - but yeah it was it was sort of a
107:49 - resource that I'd like to have so that
107:51 - was the 2020 machine learning road map
107:52 - and that sort of stayed valid like 95%
107:57 - valid up until about the launch of chat
107:59 - GPT and then it was like maybe 80% valid
108:01 - because it it and again when I say valid
108:04 - it doesn't mean that the material is
108:05 - invalid it's that it's it's missing a
108:07 - few of the newer things that are
108:08 - available if that makes sense so um the
108:11 - materials are still very valid for like
108:13 - the majority of the um uh pre generative
108:17 - AI sort of Boom but um the next one will
108:20 - sort of definitely have a lot more
108:22 - inform about generative AI tools cuz as
108:25 - I said it was up until about 2 years ago
108:26 - that they essentially didn't work very
108:29 - well at all and then it's like now they
108:31 - work really well so well we use them
108:35 - yeah exactly right yeah well I I think
108:38 - it goes without saying that if you do
108:39 - want to create like a 2025 Edition I
108:41 - always like to to joke that like you can
108:43 - release the 2025 Edition in like
108:45 - September whenever they release like
108:48 - September 2024 2025 Edition cuz that's
108:50 - when they released the 2025 version of
108:52 - cars things like that if you decide to
108:55 - do that that's what I think that's
108:56 - that's
108:57 - that's we'd be like super duper hyped to
109:00 - to post it or cross posted on free C
109:02 - Camp's YouTube channel for the community
109:04 - cuz like I enjoyed watching I I think I
109:06 - watched like two or three hours it was a
109:08 - long video uh and just like seeing you
109:10 - break down all the different fields and
109:11 - how all these disciplines interrelate
109:13 - because one thing you have is you don't
109:16 - have that academic pedigree of I've got
109:19 - a PhD in machine learning from XYZ you
109:22 - know Academy but instead you I mean
109:24 - you're a nutritionist who taught himself
109:26 - all this stuff and so you have that kind
109:28 - of like learning how to learn like in
109:31 - the in the trenches type mentality of
109:34 - like okay here's how I actually get
109:36 - things done here's how like the jobs
109:38 - that I've worked uh the first job you
109:39 - ever got by the way I you got to tell
109:42 - this story you got a your first
109:44 - developer job but you didn't actually
109:46 - apply for it like how did what happened
109:48 - exactly how did you uh how did you get
109:51 - your first job
109:53 - this is why I'm not good at answering
109:54 - the questions of like how to get a job
109:56 - it was um cuz when I got how do I get my
109:58 - first job because like I M was kind of
110:01 - and I just can only really speak to what
110:03 - I actually did was I was just again when
110:06 - I started studying machine learning at
110:08 - AI I created my online pathway and I was
110:11 - just posting on LinkedIn and my blog and
110:14 - medium uh in YouTube of like different
110:18 - different things that I was learning and
110:20 - then uh someone must have found a post
110:23 - on LinkedIn and I guess they were um
110:27 - they knew someone else and they knew
110:28 - that someone else was again this is 2018
110:31 - so machine learning AI wasn't uh as big
110:34 - as as big as it is now and so they
110:37 - talked to someone else and then I got a
110:38 - a message saying hey do you want to I
110:40 - see you're into this machine learning
110:42 - and stuff do you want to um catch up for
110:45 - coffee and I'm like yeah sure and then I
110:48 - went caught up for coffee and I kind of
110:49 - again impostor syndrome kicks in cuz I'm
110:52 - like like oh wow do I actually have
110:54 - these skills or I'm just talking about
110:55 - them and I spoke with with this person
110:59 - named Mike and uh he he didn't actually
111:02 - know he was learning from me and so I
111:04 - was like oh wow okay um I am actually
111:07 - learning some stuff and then he's like I
111:10 - know someone who I want you to meet and
111:13 - I think like they're if your if your
111:15 - goal is to get a job in the field they
111:17 - can probably help you out too I'm like
111:18 - okay sweet so met this person cam uh two
111:23 - weeks later let's say and then I'm like
111:25 - yeah my goal is like I'm studying online
111:27 - uh just in my bedroom I'm driving Uber
111:29 - on the weekends and I think I'm going to
111:31 - go to the US um in a few months and just
111:34 - find a job like that was literally my
111:36 - plan I was sort of that's that's my sort
111:38 - of happy go lucky L Nature of like I'm
111:40 - just going to fly to the US and I'm
111:42 - going to make it work right and I kind
111:45 - of just had that rational confidence of
111:47 - like this is just going to work out and
111:49 - again that's not to say that there
111:50 - weren't moments of like oh am I doing
111:52 - the right thing am I am I actually going
111:54 - to make it what all this sort of stuff
111:57 - but nonetheless I still just had this
111:59 - deep down confidence that it's like no
112:01 - if I just keep dedicating myself
112:04 - something will happen lo and behold he
112:07 - replies to that with um well have you
112:11 - considered just staying in Australia and
112:13 - I'm like no all this technology stuff is
112:15 - based in the US and he's like no we're
112:17 - actually we've got a like a small
112:20 - company like we're starting to bring
112:21 - machine learning into a austalia and I'm
112:23 - like okay and he's like yeah do you want
112:24 - to come in next Monday and I'm like okay
112:27 - sweet and so I was uh the third machine
112:31 - learning engineer at this um well
112:33 - Machine learning engineer at that stage
112:36 - um at this technology company based in
112:38 - Brisbane and we were a consultancy firm
112:42 - partnering with other big businesses in
112:43 - Australia because machine learning was
112:45 - just taking off with this another
112:46 - writing this hype cycle and so we would
112:49 - go into big businesses like insurance
112:51 - companies Banks
112:53 - uh medical centers and figure out
112:54 - whether machine learning could be
112:55 - applied to their existing problems and
112:57 - so that's where uh that sort of ties
113:00 - back into what I was saying before if
113:01 - you're from other Industries the
113:03 - technology is so widespread now that you
113:06 - can kind of do some research I'm not
113:08 - going to say you're going to have an
113:09 - epiphany straight away but do some
113:11 - research and start to draw patterns uh
113:14 - between what you do day today and what
113:16 - these Technologies are capable of and so
113:19 - it was again luck I of stumbled into it
113:23 - but on one side of it I was also
113:25 - publishing what I was doing quite
113:28 - vigorously online um was it
113:30 - groundbreaking stuff no I was just
113:32 - sharing what I'd learned and so it was
113:34 - almost like leveraging the power of the
113:37 - internet uh to you you never really know
113:40 - what's ever going to happen um so none
113:44 - of my stuff like went super viral or
113:46 - whatnot but that's not I I've never
113:48 - banked on that it was just I was just
113:50 - like I want to uh um progress my skills
113:54 - and put that out there because I know I
113:56 - knew no one and I still know no one
113:59 - really well I know a few people now
114:01 - actually in real life in my like
114:03 - Hometown who was studying machine
114:05 - learning so I'm like I have to find
114:07 - people online um so that was sort of my
114:10 - mentality and that's why I kept like
114:11 - posting things um to sort of uh not
114:16 - necessarily like put my my word out
114:18 - there but also find other people who
114:20 - were interested in it yeah yeah that's
114:23 - really cool
114:25 - um you have said in the past that if if
114:27 - an employer on the on the notion of like
114:30 - chopping around for jobs and trying to
114:32 - find a good employer you said If an
114:34 - employer doesn't think that building
114:36 - projects counts as experience you
114:38 - probably don't want to work there can
114:40 - you tell me a little bit about how you
114:42 - decide like where you want to work and
114:43 - like what you look for in an
114:46 - employer
114:48 - well I've only ever had one machine
114:50 - learning job and then I started to work
114:52 - for myself myself so that and that's
114:53 - actually been my goal the whole time is
114:55 - to start my own company um so I was uh I
114:59 - thought I wanted to work for a big tech
115:01 - company like Facebook or um meta or
115:04 - Google or something like that but then I
115:06 - realized that once I learned more about
115:08 - the lifestyle I was like no that's I I
115:12 - want want to sort of work for myself
115:14 - have my own hours have uh my own
115:17 - schedule work on what I'm interested in
115:19 - kind of just a very like selfish point
115:21 - of view but it was just a
115:22 - that's just what I want as long as
115:25 - I'm following my own curiosity and
115:29 - sharing that with the world I figured
115:30 - like that's that's how I want to live
115:32 - and I want to be able to spend time with
115:33 - my family um look after my dad that sort
115:36 - of stuff and I figured it's it would be
115:39 - really hard to do that if I was in the
115:41 - US and working uh a super big hour tech
115:46 - company sure the compensation all in
115:48 - comping lifestyle basically working for
115:51 - mean yeah
115:53 - like the sure the compensation the
115:54 - salaries everyone's heard of those but I
115:57 - I kind of learned that the economic sort
116:02 - of um category wasn't as appealing to me
116:05 - as it once was um compared to other
116:08 - things yeah and so obviously you need
116:11 - some baseline level of Economic Security
116:13 - so I wasn't going to just do nothing and
116:16 - just sporadically follow interest
116:18 - without actually turning that into
116:21 - economic value
116:22 - um and so um back to yeah I left I left
116:28 - that job started working for myself and
116:31 - um what I'd learned there is how machine
116:34 - learning gets applied in many different
116:35 - Industries or at least how it attempts
116:37 - to be applied um and so what I was like
116:40 - I was like okay I now have a balance of
116:43 - I've learned machine learning myself and
116:45 - now I've applied it in several different
116:48 - Industries I um again I published an
116:51 - article online of like things I've
116:52 - learned in my first machine learning job
116:54 - and that kind of went semi viral I guess
116:56 - in the tech space on medium and then
116:58 - someone from Canada read it Andre who's
117:01 - my business partner now uh who was
117:03 - teaching web development um on on udemy
117:07 - and his own website he's like we're
117:09 - looking for
117:11 - um machine learning curriculum all of
117:13 - our students looking for machine
117:14 - learning and I'm like okay I've never
117:16 - really taught a course online but I have
117:19 - applied these skills and I have learned
117:21 - them and so I started to to create a
117:23 - course on machine learning of like all
117:25 - the things that I'd actually worked on
117:28 - but I didn't quite learn online so it's
117:32 - very practical Hands-On um so there's no
117:35 - there's really no math in my course it's
117:36 - all just code and like this is the code
117:38 - that you you would write in day-to-day
117:40 - as a machine learning engineer and so
117:42 - that turned out to be a way that I could
117:45 - uh make a living by teaching skills I
117:48 - could also follow my curiosity by
117:50 - researching and then putting that um
117:52 - into the courses and then now because of
117:56 - the the flexibility that gives me of I
117:58 - don't have necessarily scheduled hours
118:00 - to make resources I I just make them at
118:03 - will um I can now use time to build
118:08 - nutrify which is and fund like self-fund
118:11 - uh a startup with my brother that
118:13 - combines what I'm so it's kind of like a
118:16 - uh a loop of like I learn new things to
118:18 - include in the courses and I also there
118:20 - a fly above my head learn new things to
118:22 - included in the courses and then I use
118:24 - those things to build in a practical
118:26 - application nutrify which anyone with an
118:28 - iPhone can download and use and so then
118:30 - I integrate that back the new stuff in
118:33 - the Practical world into updated
118:35 - materials it's a virtual Circle it's
118:37 - it's like an engine that you built for
118:39 - yourself where like that you've got this
118:41 - kind of like feedback loop that benefits
118:44 - you that's yeah well that's that's it
118:46 - but it's all sort of just stemmed
118:49 - from just having very real conversation
118:51 - with myself how I'd like to how I'd like
118:54 - to live and again there's there's many
118:56 - different ways to I had a physics
118:58 - teacher who had a funny saying who was
119:00 - like there's many different ways to skin
119:01 - a cat and I have no idea where that
119:03 - saying came from but it just comes into
119:05 - my head every time I think about like
119:06 - someone's like what's the what's the
119:08 - right path to learn or what's the right
119:09 - path to to live and I'm like there's
119:11 - there's so many different ways that is
119:13 - just it's just and if you you take
119:15 - advice from me take advice from anyone
119:17 - else it's it's all going to just add to
119:19 - basically sum to zero because some
119:21 - people are will be like um who have the
119:24 - opposite point of view to me is like
119:25 - well you should go work at a big tech
119:27 - company and earn $300,000 a year for
119:29 - five years and do and then after that do
119:32 - XY Z yeah I me that's that's reasonable
119:34 - advice too by the way like that's what
119:37 - I'm saying but if you can do what you
119:38 - did you skipped that you kind of leap
119:40 - frogged over the because you're able to
119:42 - sell fund by creating courses by having
119:44 - a successful YouTube channel and uh you
119:47 - know and you're able to apply your
119:50 - knowledge so that you can sell fund your
119:52 - startup which self funding your startup
119:54 - is a hundred times better than having to
119:55 - like answer to investors all the time
119:57 - and I say that as like well I've talked
119:59 - to so many people that uh prefer it it
120:02 - depends on like you can't have a
120:03 - self-funded satellite company but yeah
120:06 - yeah for some businesses yeah
120:08 - fortunately um our business is yeah we
120:11 - don't have any expenses except for our
120:13 - time oh and database storage which is
120:15 - quite cheap but um yeah we've been
120:18 - rejected a few times from uh from like
120:20 - things like this AI Grant and we've been
120:22 - rejected half a doz there was even
120:24 - a yeah my friend applied for that uh
120:28 - yeah everybody gets rejected like I
120:29 - think pretty much everybody I've had on
120:31 - the podcast has been rejected from black
120:32 - commentator for example well that's what
120:34 - I mean so that's that's what I mean it's
120:36 - like it's the sort of the the nature of
120:39 - um the tech field in general is that
120:41 - it's just it's it's l literally just
120:45 - experimenting nonstop and like most of
120:48 - those experiments won't work and so
120:50 - whether it's like you're beginning to uh
120:52 - learn whatever it is it's just like if
120:54 - you are curious about something it's
120:55 - just like follow that Curiosity but just
120:57 - beware that basically the most of what
121:00 - you do won't necessarily work out so but
121:03 - then what you can you do with that is
121:06 - apply what doesn't work the the quicker
121:08 - you figure out what doesn't work the
121:10 - quicker you figure out what does and so
121:12 - that's one of the reasons uh like I have
121:14 - a saying in my all my courses is
121:16 - experiment experiment experiment is
121:18 - because uh whether it's with learning
121:20 - how to learn whether it's with communic
121:22 - ating with customers or investors or
121:24 - something else like that it's like
121:25 - you're just it's just all one big
121:28 - experiment um and so the more
121:30 - experiments you run the the quicker you
121:33 - figure out what doesn't work the quicker
121:34 - you figure out what does yeah well uh
121:38 - that that is such a profound simple
121:40 - thing like just keep experimenting keep
121:41 - iterating on your ideas don't build the
121:44 - Chariot behind closed doors hopefully
121:46 - none of us are ever in a
121:47 - post-apocalyptic situation where it
121:49 - makes sense to skin a cat and eat it
121:53 - I hope we never again that's another one
121:55 - of those things from high school that
121:56 - I'm now remembering that's like I don't
121:59 - condone like maybe he grew up during the
122:01 - Depression or something I I don't know I
122:04 - don't know but it's just a saying he
122:05 - would do he would he would like do sign
122:07 - and cl mathematics and his head on the
122:09 - on the Whiteboard and then like write an
122:10 - algorithm and be like cuz he's a really
122:13 - smart like he's genius physicist and
122:15 - then he'd write like several different
122:16 - things and be like oh we don't have to
122:18 - do that formula we can do this one
122:19 - thousand ways to skin a cat so now it's
122:22 - just like whenever I think of whenever I
122:24 - think of something with multiple paths
122:26 - it's just ingrained to me of like why
122:27 - would someone say that but I don't know
122:30 - it makes sense to me well it's a very
122:32 - literary expression and I want to draw
122:33 - attention to uh for those of you not
122:35 - watching the video who are listening to
122:36 - the podcast which is how I listen I
122:38 - don't actually watch the videos I watch
122:39 - I listen to the podcast you can
122:41 - subscribe to the podcast distributed
122:43 - through the RSS feed the open Airwaves
122:47 - uh of this open protocol real simple
122:49 - syndication uh you can listen in apple
122:51 - podast pod uh Spotify wherever you
122:53 - listen to podcasts but if you're
122:55 - watching on YouTube you will see behind
122:57 - Daniel quite a stocked bookshelf you've
123:01 - got probably like I don't know two or
123:03 - 300 books on there uh yeah I think
123:05 - that's right yeah so you actually read
123:08 - physical books if you're like a
123:09 - technologist I love physical books yeah
123:12 - talk talk about that's my that's my
123:13 - addiction physical books so you just
123:17 - like take a book to the beach or where
123:18 - do you get most of your reading
123:20 - done uh yeah basically anywhere in the
123:22 - in the backyard um I have a little like
123:25 - just wooden table and chairs and I every
123:27 - morning I I usually out there um early
123:29 - morning and just um look at my garden
123:32 - and read some read some pages um coffee
123:36 - shops basically anywhere in bed before
123:39 - um going to sleep physical books like
123:42 - I'll often fall asleep holding a
123:43 - physical book um I just find it yeah
123:46 - very soothing very calming like in this
123:49 - again like my my life is mostly built
123:52 - around screen so I feel like um a
123:55 - physical book is just a it's not trying
123:58 - to sell you anything you've already
123:59 - bought it it's like it's like one of the
124:01 - last places on Earth where there's no
124:03 - ads um so hopefully thats the case yeah
124:08 - exactly right and it's um I just I just
124:11 - love it there's something very
124:13 - satisfying about the tangibility of like
124:16 - flipping through pages and like I guess
124:20 - I don't know completing a chapter or
124:22 - something like that and then like just
124:24 - the smell it's just very nostalgic to me
124:27 - I can't I can't really explain it but
124:29 - it's like it's I just know that I love
124:31 - it and one of the reasons I bring up
124:33 - books I'm not just like doing this to
124:35 - comment on your beautiful bookshelf back
124:37 - there uh you wrote a book and published
124:40 - it a novel if I recall correctly uh
124:44 - about maybe a year year and a half ago
124:47 - uh can you can you talk about that
124:49 - experience and what drove you to write
124:51 - fiction
124:53 - yeah well um so for those who aren't for
124:56 - listening this is my novel it's on the
124:58 - screen called Charlie walks but Daniel
125:00 - Burke it's in the flesh just to say that
125:02 - like to prove that Quincy is not making
125:04 - anything up this is but every word in
125:06 - this is by me uh some some help from uh
125:10 - uh an editor of course to to fix the
125:12 - typos and mistakes but um no I just
125:16 - I basically I like I'm a copycat if I
125:19 - see someone doing something that I find
125:22 - inspiring I want to do that and um so
125:26 - some of my best mentors in life are
125:29 - authors and I've never met I've never
125:32 - met anyone I can't think of any maybe in
125:36 - real life maybe I don't think I've met
125:38 - anyone who's written any of the books on
125:40 - the shelves in real life I mean a lot of
125:41 - them are passed on um but I read them
125:46 - and it's almost like yeah you you have
125:49 - this connection and it's just like
125:51 - that's inspire spiring to me and so a
125:52 - lot of my heroes are authors and so I'm
125:54 - like well I want to do that and I kind
125:58 - of didn't read much at all in high
126:00 - school or even just outside of
126:03 - university cuz I was it was a lot of
126:05 - books that you quote unquote have to
126:07 - read and that's kind of a theme with a
126:09 - lot of my learning is like I forget
126:11 - anything that I had to learn whereas I
126:13 - remember everything that I wanted
126:15 - remember every page of the atlas but
126:16 - nothing of you know high school
126:18 - chemistry class or something like that
126:19 - right exactly you're forced to learn
126:21 - that but but when you're pursuing your
126:23 - own interest it feels so fresh and
126:25 - interesting and like you've discovered
126:27 - this and yeah personal and I started
126:30 - reading yeah fiction novels the first
126:32 - proper fiction novel like obviously uh
126:34 - as a child I think I read a little bit
126:36 - of Harry Potter with with uh my parents
126:38 - and whatnot but then the first fiction
126:40 - novel that really got me into like wow
126:43 - writing can be this was uh post office
126:47 - by Charles macowski which is uh worked
126:50 - in a post office years like that was his
126:52 - fulltime job right that was his
126:54 - full-time job was working
126:56 - like excuse me um Charles macowski for
127:00 - people who don't know is a a very
127:02 - prominent American German author um but
127:07 - he for the majority of his life just
127:09 - worked dead beat jobs which is what he
127:12 - describes them as um and then he has a
127:16 - bunch of books that are basically just
127:17 - writing about this life and um that he
127:20 - lived and so post office was his first
127:24 - novel and it's basically just a story of
127:26 - how he worked at a post office for 12
127:28 - years and hated it and uh a lot of
127:30 - people can read Bow's work and be sort
127:33 - of um I guess find it sad or like he had
127:38 - this very grim look on life but I I kind
127:40 - of and this is maybe my rosec colored
127:42 - glasses I kind of looked at it and it
127:44 - was just like you can make artwork out
127:47 - of the mundane that was so inspiring to
127:49 - me I was like this is I didn't want to
127:51 - put the book down I and I'd never really
127:54 - had that feeling with a book and like
127:56 - ever since I was a child when I was
127:58 - reading another um A Series of
128:00 - Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket
128:02 - that's like another series that I read
128:03 - as a kid um it Fly going around um and I
128:07 - read this book and I'm like oh my gosh
128:09 - you can just write a story about
128:12 - anything you want and it's amazing and
128:15 - so I'm like I want to do that and then
128:18 - that's where like I started writing like
128:20 - about probably a year or two after I
128:22 - read post office I started I started
128:24 - writing my own novel and um finished it
128:29 - basically through Co um when it was
128:31 - lockdowns and all that sort of stuff and
128:34 - uh yeah wanted to get it go right to the
128:36 - end of not just um not just writing
128:38 - behind closed doors but similar to sort
128:40 - of how I like to publish a lot of what I
128:43 - work on is I wanted to get it um out in
128:47 - the world I wanted to to to have my name
128:49 - basically amongst the the other people
128:52 - on the shelves and just be like that was
128:54 - fun I'm I'm glad I did that that was fun
128:56 - I didn't and if you had told me it's
128:58 - another thing it's like you told me when
128:59 - I was a young that I would be writing a
129:02 - my own book or fiction book I would be
129:05 - like no that's that's stupid but then
129:07 - again things change over time
129:10 - right yeah absolutely and uh I think
129:14 - that's really cool that you pursued that
129:17 - uh that dream of publishing a book and
129:19 - having your book on the Shelf uh a
129:21 - living author among many dead authors on
129:24 - your bookshelf back there uh I'm going
129:26 - to put a link to check out
129:29 - Charlie yeah one day but hopefully you
129:31 - got like another 80 years ahead of you
129:33 - man who knows what kind of medical
129:35 - advancements are going to be brought
129:36 - about by gener yeah that's a good
129:38 - point and of course I'm sure you're
129:40 - taking good care of your nutrition that
129:42 - being your domain of expertise so uh

130:39 - fantastic fun productive week until next
130:43 - week happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

programming to me is just thinking like a lot of my time I think if if people get the um the idea of like if you're a software engineer you just spend all day um writing code I would say now majority like I do write a lot of code however uh I use AI tools such as GitHub copilot to write a lot of the boiler plate welcome back to the freec code Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freec camp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tex this week we're joined by Daniel Burke Daniel is a machine learning engineer he's the creator of many popular tutorials on YouTube and he's a frequent contributor to the Freo Camp YouTube channel Daniel welcome to the podcast hey Quincy it's it's great to be here uh I actually started to learn to code back in the day I think it was about 2017 on free code Camp um I remember going through all the projects and so yeah it's really cool to be here absolutely man it's great to have you here and I just want to emphasize that uh it's an honor to count among our alumni somebody like yourself who not only goes out and practices like kind of Leading Edge uh machine learning techniques but also turns around and teaches other people how to do that that's super chill and I also want to acknowledge that uh a couple years ago you you made a you had a pretty good year on YouTube and you turned around and you donated the proceeds from your YouTube channel to freeo Camp uh to our charity and that was super kind of you and that helped uh that went toward teacher compensation that went toward keeping the 100 servers we have around the world up and running and uh so I just want to publicly thank you for doing that it was my pleasure I've gained a lot from free code Camp so yeah it was uh very very heartwarming for me to be able to give back in some way yeah well let's dive in and learn more about you man like I have really enjoyed watching your videos over the past few years and uh to be completely candid I still don't know that much about your personal life I know how like Ironclad your work ethic is and how you have all these different techniques to be incredibly productive which you you know delve into on your channel but you're based over there in brisban in Australia I hope I'm pronouncing it correctly Brisbane how do you pronounce it uh bris Brisbane so like bris bin okay so it's almost like there's no e on the end like bris bin yeah yeah but Bane is yeah it kind of looks like Bane bris well it's like I I always would pronounce Melbourne and when I went to Melbourne people were like oh it's Melbourne like it's very Australia we like to compress the vows as much as possible yeah yeah that's awesome well I mean Americans we do the same thing right like we have like these words like these French words that we inherited and we just chop them down to like it'll be like seven letters and it'll be like one syllable right so um yeah well let's talk about your childhood out there cuz it sounds like you had a pretty idelic childhood I understand that you live pretty close to where you grew up I do yeah so my uh family home is about a kilometer down the road uh the house I live in now I live in with uh my second brother I have three younger brothers so there's four boys in our family and uh yeah my other two brothers live a kilometer down the street with both my parents and we really love the area um so back a few years ago I was thinking about moving to the US but then that that just didn't happen cuz I found a job in Australia and I'm like you know what the internet's good enough I'm just going to stay here cuz yeah I love it we live really close to uh the sandate foreshore or Waterfront which if you look on Google Maps just a beautiful area the three biggest sand islands are actually just just off the east coast of Australia so we live opposite um three biggest sand islands in the world that is we live opposite Morton Island which is the third biggest sand Island it's a beautiful place we go there for family holidays um every year so um I turned 30 last year what is a sand island is it like a sand bar like literally just sand there's no so imagine just a huge Sand Bar yeah so it's like just pure sand um yeah I mean there is some dirt but it's like most majority sand so if you like dig dig underneath the the grass and whatnot that's sort of made its way there over time through wind and water um you'll just start digging into sand um but yeah it's a huge Sandbar like we're talking I think one side of the island is like 25 km long so maybe 16 Mi or whatever the I'm not sure the the conversion there but it's um yeah it's a it's a great great place um and yeah we go there as that's been our family holiday since we were kids and it's about an hour boat ride offshore and uh you can take your full drive there and drive around all the sand tracks and go fishing and the water's nice and protected and uh and calm so it's almost like a big Harbor SL Lake uh so it's not where where I go for walks in the in the afternoon and evenings is is really really calm it's not like it's a beach but it's not like a a wach walking on like an ocean beach but there's not like a bunch of waves exactly yeah so it's more like a big uh like Lagoon SL Lake yeah that's that's how I would describe it that's really cool going you're not going surfing there how often yeah maybe maybe like kitty surfing like getting your kids ready for like seeing if they can stand on the board uh yeah like like how often do you actually go out to the beach and go for walks almost every day like I was out there yesterday went for a walk with my two young brothers and dogs and we were walking for I think an hour and a half or or so but it's yeah it's a beautiful I try to get out to see the water almost every day and we call it the scenic route when you drive home is like driving driving home we take the long way instead of like going straight to the house we drive drive along the Boulevard and just look out in the big expansive water yeah well Australia has a lot of big cities uh of course like you know Melbourne and uh uh Sydney and you know Brisbane uh like is that like a a major Tech Hub or is it like what is the popular what what is the industry like there well I would say definitely Sydney is the like the tech Hub or like just a business Hub in general and then Melbourne probably follows that as a close second and then brisbane's probably third after that um so if you like if I wanted to be really into it and definitely get a job in the industry I'd probably move to Sydney or Mourne um to work at a place but because of I mean the internet these days like brison's not that far behind and I I've been to Sydney to me that's that's like the New York of Australia it's too it's too hectic for me uh I I quite like to just chill out and uh not sit in traffic for hours at a time and uh Melbourne is beautiful like just a beautiful um conglomerate of different cultures there's almost many cities within a city in Melbourne that's how I perceive it and then Brisbane is kind of almost like I'm biased obviously but brisbane's like The Best of Both Worlds of Sydney and Melbourne so it's got that just enough busy but not too crazy but it's also got it's really starting to now um pop off pop off with with different little pockets of of culture and restaurants and that sort of stuff yeah that sounds really cool I mean that's like kind of the city like I like to live in like I like to live in a city but New York City Los Angeles like a little bit too big and being you know and I've seen like videos you just going out and ride bikes or like those like really bikes what tricle things I don't know what it is a big wheel we call a big wheel yeah yeah dries oh they yeah so they're epic they're like um yeah so little tricycles you you're sitting probably 2 to 3 Ines off the ground um in a bucket seat you got one big wheel on the front and uh then you have two rubber tires on the back and you make them into drift trikes by putting PVC pipe over the tires so there basically on the bitchman there's there's no no grip uh so you can you can move but then as soon as you try to turn your whole back end slides Out and because my family home is on a on a pretty steep hill and pretty long like it's a few hundred meters long um we we'd have we built these drift trikes and then we'd we'd ride down the side street to get speed turn left onto the hill and then just you could just skid out down the whole bottom of the hill you'd have someone down there looking out for when there's cars they give it all clear and then you just shoot down walk back up the hill start again so it's like Initial D for kids almost yeah Initial D you're familiar with the anime the drift racing kid no I have oh wait is that the one with the um that's the where the 86 is that the Toyota 86 yeah yeah okay I know it from the car cuz my friends are really into cars and uh they love their Toyota 86 and so I've kind of I've heard of it from there I went back and rewatched the first season it's pretty pretty exciting like uh yeah is it's cool it still holds up uh but yeah like like the like whenever I play like Mario Kart or something that's the thing I like to power slide right and so the notion that you could actually physically do that how dangerous like do you ever tip over yeah yeah like you'll you'll hit the like you got videos of us like you hit the gutter and you kind of cuz your front wheel's so big it um you hit the gutter and then it goes you like tip over the front cuz your uh um your front reel doesn't Mount The Gutter It just gets stuck like basically luckily there was no uh touchwood hectic accidents so minor crashes skin knees that sort of stuff but nothing too outlandish yeah but that sounds like so fun just like a nice physical activity go out and enjoy the outdoors it sounds like you're quite the Outdoorsman that you've optimized for spending a lot of time Outdoors through your lifestyle 100% yeah I like uh yeah I kind of love the balance between uh being sort of a monk in the mountains and just exploring and doing nothing most of the time and then uh being like a tech nerd and in front of screens all day and concentrating and Building Things and making stuff so it's a yeah I wouldn't say it's 50/50 but it's uh sometimes the one one side builds up too much and then I'm like okay I'm sick of relaxing and being in the mountains I need to go do some computer stuff and then vice versa it's like okay I'm sick of being in front of a computer I need to get outside yeah and and you can just toggle between the two like really easily you got the beach there you've got that Hill that you can you know drift race down well it's no you're so right like it's not far it's about the the uh where I live is probably as 10minute walk to the to the beach front and so yeah and or bike ride like I go for one of the two to almost every day so it's a very uh yeah it's a very cool place yeah well I'm excited to learn a little bit about like you know they say that like people up in really cold brutal climates like like Russia or Scandinavia they become like the best Chess Masters cuz they're forced to they they have the best authors because they're like forced to stay in all the time and they can't go out and have fun in the sun and you know and yet you're in a very like it sounds like a great place to just relax and enjoy the outdoors and yet you are also very productive staying inside working on your laptop a lot maybe you could talk a little bit about that like how growing up what got you interested in technology when you've got like this great big Outdoors like Australia famous for being like very sparsely populated having this huge kind of Outback area that takes up most of the continent uh like I mean why didn't you end up like uh Steve Irwin for example why why are you why are you more like Yan laon or somebody like that right yeah maybe I'm I'm a crossover between Steve irn and Yan laon I kind of got similar hair to Steve um that's a that's a fantastic question I I basically got into computers as early as I can remember I mean my parents I remember them being at my grandparents house basically talking about the fact that um talking my mom was talking with my grandparents that she was going to buy a computer computer and I was just so interested I didn't actually know what it was and then um uh this is maybe when I was 5 six or seven and then she bought a computer for her business and or our family business that is and it was one of those old school ones like big gray plastic box like monitor was probably I mean if we looked at the size of that monitor these days it would be like people really looked at these for hours on there uh whereas now we're kind of blessed with 30in High defin screens but um yeah I was just fascinated with it and then you just sort of you get into that habit of just as a kid just playing around clicking things going through I remember going through because this is I think almost pre internet or the internet was like dial up and so it it kind of sucked and then um but I remember just clicking through the menus just being like I can move this thing on the desk and it like relates to the screen I'm actually still fascinated by that whenever I cuz I haven't delved into like how computer hardware works at a really deep level um it still fascinates me that there's analog Parts in computers and like you press a key and it somehow triggers a current and then the letter Q appears on your screen anyway um got into that naturally started to find the internet naturally started to find online games and it just like just went from there my dad started to get uh he was a teacher at the high school I went to and then he started to laptops started to get introduced but he he never learned to use a computer he never learned to use a smartphone um and that's also like really fascinating to me is thinking about cuz now like my life is basically computers and screens but he's lived his whole life without basically without computers and screens so it's like really like fascinating to me like that J position and I feel like that's kind of influenced me a lot into um not just being 100% involved in screen time um but he got a laptop and basically yeah never never really learned to use it so my brothers would like hijack it cuz he'd bring it home from school and we'd get this laptop and because it was much newer than our um computer I remember when we got WiFi at home um that was like early early days of WiFi and I'm pretty sure I may be wrong here I'm fairly sure the the technology for WiFi was invented in Australia may be wrong there but um when my friends would come over they were like what the hell you have WiFi in your house cuz it was like this thing that you would only get at school and so we'd hack um well not hack but I would get my Dad's laptop download a bunch of things back in the day was lime wire uh MSN Messenger and then within probably a month the computer would just be toast because it's just full of malware and that sort of stuff um would you like format it and like just try again well that's the thing like it was just like we would never reset said that it would just go to um the IT department and uh we don't know if it was like getting reset or if they just gave him a new one or whatnot but um he he he legitimately hard they must have hated him every month he brings in like his malware L computer that he doesn't even use exactly like the It people are like doing labor for his crazy kids just surfing the web being Reckless right that's funny oh and then then we kind of got a a bit um I guess you could say entrepreneurial or nefarious I guess it's been enough time you can tell these stories now is that um my dad had the teachers login right and so the teachers login had access to all the student hard drives and so um my friend and I in high school we actually had a little side business um like hacking into the smart kids and like selling their assignments to people who uh which in retrospect I don't condone this but it's like that's basically I wanted more time to play video games so I didn't have a job I would just like we ran a business uh hacking into other students assignments um wow which that's pretty pretty it's like CH before Che right yeah exactly yeah like like homework assignments but it was it was local to the school so yeah I mean that's industrious and I'm not going to travel back in time and condemn your kid even though obviously preo camp we have very high standards for academic honesty and I I am not going to condone any such thing but I will say that like I mean that is something you can do like I used to print out Mortal Kombat moves lists like back in in the arcade like nobody knew the moves you had to like learn the moves through trial and eror like oh forward down forward forward High punch we'll do this Subzero you know Fine Thing uh but like people didn't know that so I like collected all that stuff and I formatted this nice sheet and I would like take it to the arcades and I be like hey you you know you want all the moves from Mortal Kombat they be like sure be like all right five bucks and like just sell it and like exactly money just materializing out of nowhere right uh so similarly kind of like that early hustle well yes exactly I would I would much more recommend that route of actually creating materials in academic honesty but this is this is almost like pre this is I think I was like 14 or 15 so I kind of I'm like well the file's already there like we hadn't really been bombarded with like the importance of academic Integrity just yet and I'm just like well I have all these people who are like uh no one was doing their assignments cuz we were all I knew they weren't because we were all playing video games together and then I was like anyway um so basically into computers like the whole time um and then uh yeah Outdoors was just because it's I feel like it's in Australia it's like it's there so you're just um into it like we go to the the beach like for family holidays like we have so Brisbane uh North is the Sunshine Coast about an an hour drive 45 minutes and that's a whole bunch of beautiful beaches and then an hour south is the Gold Coast which I'm sure many people around the world have heard of and that's again just a collection of of some of the best beaches in the world so it's whereas like other cities like Perth there's a beach at the city so like you're uh you could have skyscrapers but then 10 minutes down the street it's like ocean and then of course Sydney there's Bondi Beach all that sort of stuff so it's like it's very yeah ingrained in Australian culture to to be beachy and Outdoors but and because most of the population is I think it's within 25 km of a coastline like 95% plus of the population is within 25 km of a of a coastline so it's kind of just ingrained in us to to go to the beach or to be outdoors and I feel like we're kind of a couple of years behind in terms of tech technology well that's what I noticed as a kid was like we'd always you'd see the new stuff get released in like the us or uh UK and we kind of it would trickle down to Australia in like 2 to 3 years I think the Gap as as like slightly Clos because of just globalization and whatnot but especially when I was hacking around on my Dad's laptop I'd be see all these new releases and be like oh I got to wait like 2 to 3 years I remember buying like my first Xbox accessory on the internet net and like having to convince my mom that it was safe and it took 6 weeks to arrive and then it was like it broke after 2 or 3 days and then it took 8 weeks to send back and get another one and like that me geographically you're very far from you know I know you're a lot closer to Asia than you are to North America that's what I mean right so a lot of things arrive late in Australia but not WiFi it was indeed invented by the Australian science uh Bureau or or I can't can't it's it's called uh it's called CS i o the National Science agency so like as as a taxpaying American one of the one of the I guess many developments that that have come out of like the US government uh is what is GPS right like so all those GPS satellites that was technically like us taxpayers that like subsidize the development for that for and now everyone in the world gets a benefit from having like Apple Maps or Google Maps or um you know various tools that they can embed into their website or GIS systems things like that um and I want to thank the people of Australia for subsidizing development of WiFi because I use it every day exactly same thing it's kind of yeah ubiquitous now you know yeah yeah I mean like those waves are passing through you as we speak they're everywhere yeah well maybe actually yeah maybe in a 100 years time we'll kind of go oh maybe it wasn't a good idea to pass electromagnetic waves through uh the entire world yeah but it's not ionizing I don't think it's too big a deal we'll see we'll see I could be wrong touchwood as they say in Australia or knock on wood as they say here in the US uh so I am really stoked to so it sounds like you had a great childhood um being uh an outdoorsy being a slacker you know the there's this saying about programmers that like the best programmers are lazy cuz they'll figure out like inventive ways to not have to do work um and it sounds like you're like at least like as a child you were someone lazy uh is that is that a mischaracterization well I was lazy towards the things that I was um told to do in a sense like so school like I was I was kind of uh naturally curious in terms of I would just I remember when I was like 10 I just would read the I read this Atlas like back to front like this, 1100 page Atlas and so I just I got an A in geography Without Really Trying but I was just fascinated by uh this this Atlas And so that Trend kind of continued through High School Xbox came out and I just would play Call of Duty and we we we ran the the number one this is back before egaming was like a a thing um Esports sorry um um we had this online forum and I would just we was like six of us at high school we had this team and our team was the number one in Australia so I would get home from school from like 330 cuz I liveed so close and we'd just plan strategies for Call of Duty until like midnight and then I'd go to sleep and wake up at 10 to 8 to be at school by 815 um so that was basically my senior years at high school but it was I would I would like just I don't know get passing grades through high school not really excelling but we we really did excel at Call of Duty because it was just fascinating to us you could put that as an extracurricular on your college application I guess like one Call of Duty team in Australia maybe the counselor would like recognize the value in that did you did you end up going to school like University or what did you do I did I did straight out of high school I went to University the University of Queensland which is a beautiful University one of the best in Australia and it's um it's uh uh for the first two years I was kind of just floundering around and um because it was just the thing that you did right um I didn't really know what I wanted to do out of high school because as I said I was just into Call of Duty but um or into computer games but back then 2010 that was not viable like to keep going down that path like computer video games it's still not really viable like like the biggest like Esports like the I my understanding is they got a lot of investment but they haven't been able to recoup that and a lot of them are not very solvent right now um well that's what I mean right like it's like yeah it was it was if it's a if it's a fake business now it was even more of a fake business um like in 2010 when I graduated high school but then yeah I I went to University kind of just um I was like I wanted to be a doctor for the I guess more so for the just The Prestige of saying I'm I'm a doctor rather than that was fundamentally it's a powerful thing to be able to say at a dinner party or on a plane when somebody's having Cardiac Arrest I'm a doctor everybody fors and you can walk right over and you can help the person right uh exactly I I can definitely see the appeal yeah so that's that's that's that was the main reason was more so for the status rather than for the the uh like actual will to or interest in studying human systems and helping people and so I basically fa failed almost every subject for the first two years of University before I got called in by the dean of Science and to his credit was basically like hey is everything okay like your grades are terrible and should you really be at University if you're if you're getting grades and um I kind of offered the um excuse that my dad was sick and like he he was and still is but it was really just because I was like well I'm lazy and I'm not really interested in what I'm studying and so on the side of that was the real reason the good reason was oh yeah my dad was sick please don't kick me out of University um but on the side while I was doing biom medicine and that sort of stuff I was studying food science and nutrition on my own uh because I was getting into the gym and I'm like I want to be fit I want to be healthy I want to lift weights I want to build muscle and so I was watching YouTube till 1100 p.m. at night of people talking about how to work out bodybuilding nutrition that sort of stuff and so I was telling him that that's like he's like what are you interested in I'm like well I've been learning about this and he's like why don't you just change to food science and nutrition and I was like huh like a light bulb clicked I was like yeah you're right I can just change to what I'm interested in I kind of didn't I don't know it sounds like such a simple realization but um because I was so sort of stuck in that uh floundering mindset of like I don't really want to study this I'm failing this scks um I don't really know I'm kind of lost basically um that was just such a simple light bulb and I'm still really thankful to uh his name is Peter or it might have been pod I think pod's his nickname but Peter said he's like why don't you just study what you're interested in you're already learning about it and I'm like wow such a simple realization and then I I changed to food science Nutrition the next semester and basically got top of the class for the next 3 years cuz I I'd already many of the things in the first two years I'd already like learned on my own and so that was kind of like Premed was probably what you were studying do they have an equivalent Premed yeah yeah uh you probably already knew a lot about like biology right like all the different you know metabolism systems and stuff like that sort of I didn't even do biology in high school when I say I was really just like oh this girl is that I like is also doing um biom medicine I want to do biom medicine because I like this girl and I also like the idea of one day telling people I'm I'm a doctor but that's that was 17yearold me and I guess with time you become a little wiser hopefully so um yeah that's what that's what happened and then yeah studied that and then passed with or actually didn't just pass like almost top of the class the whole way through and then uh graduated with that and I basically that was the more important lesson was learning how to learn like I I I realized that I was like oh if I'm interested in something and I just dedicate myself in a semi structured SL experimental fashion I can learn whatever I want basically like it felt that's how it felt that it felt like a superpower it was was like oh I'm just going to have to devote myself wholeheartedly to something that I'm fascinated and interested in yeah subsequently coding programming is just basically exactly the same thing yeah recurring uh character stepping onto the stage of the preo camp podcast each week learning how to learn uh and of course obligatory mention of Barbara Oakley's uh learn how to learn course which you know Leon Noel has mentioned I think Ben Awad mentioned it like a lot of different people who've been on the podcast have talked about the uh learning how to learn and just what it unlocks for you like I I'll I'll go on Soliloquy here uh developers the number one job descript is not sitting there and turning coffee into code or whatever it says on the cup uh but rather learning that is the killer app that is really what you're paid to do is learn what this Legacy code base is what it how it works and then going in and learning you know what you need to do to accomplish whatever goal has been put in front of you by your boss or by the open source Community or whoever you're beholden to um to get things done right so um yeah learn how to learn all right that that concludes the little the little ad read for learn how to learn as a mentality and yeah so so you were able to finish school you walked away with not just a degree from a a good school uh but also probably a lot of knowledge about health and nutrition but also just like this skill to learn new things what do you do from there yeah I would say that's yeah that was yeah the learning how to learn was just that's the Meta School right you can apply that to anything so that was 2015 I graduated and then uh I studied um uh Eastern languages for a year because I was working at Apple as a um a genius quote unquote that that was my actual title like youd help people when their uh their Hardware wouldn't turn on or something like that what was the most common thing that people would ask for help with uh broken screens or battery life of iPhones okay and so and so um they and then of course backups so uh it's kind of been ingrained into me to be um uh how would you say kind of obs obsessed with backing things up so um the amount of times I would have to have a very difficult conversation with someone to basically say everything on your laptop is gone because you didn't have a backup and you spilled coffee all over it and now it won't turn on and that we basically couldn't help you you may be able to go to like a data recovery center but again that there's no promises there because I mean it's all liquid damaged so they were very tough conversations to have and so yeah I've got goodness like half a dozen backups of almost everything everywhere okay what just off the cuff what is a good backup strategy I talked to like the CTO of my company he had a hard drive like a local hard drive that he had like time machine on uh time machine being the Apple backup thing I'm not sure if it's still called time machine but he had time machine and every day when he showed up with his laptop he plugg into that external hard drive at work and then he had one at home and he plugged into that and his reasoning is it's unlikely that both of these hard drives going to are going to fail concurrently or that there's going to fire be a fire that breaks out both at my home and my office concurrently so as long as I have one backup I'm good but like would that level of redundancy be enough for you or do you have you go even more hardcore than that I would say that yeah that would be like the minimum for me is uh so I've got my my personal setup is just um got the external hard drive uh got two of those actually I have uh iCloud on my personal Mac and then I have Dropbox and then I have cuz again these are just ease of use and I think as a developer I could probably set up my own cloud bucket these days but just the ease of use of these software companies are basically dedicated towards backups and then finally back Blaze um so they do basically just a um complete encapsulation of your hard drive and put that on their cloud storage so there's about five different versions of my just my local um MacBook Pro but then I have my server upstairs my deep learning PC um and so right now that's a bit more rudimentary I kind of just um rsync uh cuz it's Linux machine I just rsync yeah every every week or so um with an external hard drive and then uh I cuz I basically just use it to write code that's all just get committed um and then so if I was if that computer again touch W was to just completely fail I could um get a new one tomorrow plug in the hard drive R sync it across it would take a bit set up of course and then get clone the repos that I've been working on and then be off to the market awesome so like I mean that's got to be a very difficult conversation to have with a total stranger who just walked in like you know I always think like if you ever played like Friday the 13th on NES when you lose it doesn't just say game over it says you and all your friends are dead game [Laughter] over it's almost like that that kind of thing like the text appears every file that you loved is gone forever it it wasn't yeah thankfully it was like it was fairly rare but it was often enough to to yeah to be burned into my brain um but yeah it was it was that was really that job was actually really cool because it was like it was I could work on technology all day just be fascinated by that cuz I'm a nerd and um I would just talk to people all day so that's like kind of it built up my people skills and communication skills CU I would have to explain like a hardware repair or a file system structure in a in a way that uh a grandmother could understand because all your customers would be from different walks of life some of them wouldn't be able to speak English as well as I could um cuz we were in the city I so we would get tourists we would get uh elderly people we would get University students and so um I think over my three or so years there working parttime I I served 4 and a half 5,000 customers and so um it's just that repetition h of explaining something in something that someone could understand it was and that kind of really helped me um going into like programming and then subsequently um teaching myself that cuz I was write notes and code and then explain it to myself in a simple way that I understood and then later on a few years later would be like okay I've kind of built up this latent skill of talking to people talking to anyone um cuz I drove Uber for a year as well um and so that's kind of uh um like another where like you get in and you're just meeting a new person every 10 minutes and it's like okay some people don't want to talk that's fair I'm quite the I don't know animated talkative person uh just generally I think I get that from being the oldest brother and kind of got to be almost the leader of the pack you know and um that kind of gave me that yeah latent skill of just being able to have a conversation with anyone about almost anything so i' would be comfortable in walking into any room and starting a conversation with someone um from from zero and then in a technical aspect I would also be quite com but there was something I knew explaining or figuring out the where where they were um in terms of the the knowledge stack uh whether it be zero or whether it be okay we can just talk as if we were um both completely on the same level um so I don't really have to explain everything in depth if you know what I mean so that was that was really valuable I didn't quite realize how valuable that was at the time it was just like oh this is a cool job I'm working for Apple it's it's the biggest technology company in the world um it's not necessarily on the building the machines or the um the software that's what I wanted to get into um right but it was yeah that skill that you sort of just like at University it was that meta skill that I didn't quite realize until after the fact that was so important it's like it's very easy to go oh yeah you learned food science and nutrition like that's the important thing you you learned from there and it's like well to me I look back and I was like I was studying that for fun uh yes it is very helpful to know about health and nutrition and fitness and whatnot but it's also really good meta skill to have is being able to learn something that you're interested in and then another meta skill of like being able to talk to almost anyone about anything and that's that's certainly just in retrospect that i' sort of noticed that and so yeah after I left University Apple um had a program that would um if you want because there was so many International customers if you wanted to uh do a language course they would subsidize the the language course um and so I studied Japanese and Chinese for a year at um at the same University that I went to because I was just really interested in eastern languages and Eastern culture and we had a few um Chinese and Japanese speaking people that worked with us so it could practice there and then when customers would come in um I could I could talk to them like one of my favorite things to say was like if it was a Chinese speaking customer I would be like May and would just like instantly recognize what I would say which is do you have a backup or not um because like just saying do you have a backup if if someone hadn't really um been studying English for a number of years that concept of backup idiomatic expression what does that mean exactly right they're like they're like what does that mean and then I'd say ne May B they be like and it's like Mayo like as in okay no back up it's like okay well then we need to focus on that first yeah yeah and in Japanese do they have like a word for that or they just say back up yeah I didn't yeah I didn't quite think like the terms we didn't get to use it as much in Japanese I don't know it I don't know it if they have a specific term because um I'm not sure what yeah they just say back up a larger customer base was yeah Chinese speaking Yeah Yeah but um say back up yeah you're right I think that might be correct and like B fun is is kind of like uh like piece of of equipment like equipment yeah cuz play B is like show B like like gear almost um yeah I'm sorry I'm not going to like try to pick apart the emology on like there may be some people in the audience who do yeah yeah I spent 20 years like learning Chinese and I'm getting back in Japanese I'm going to go to Japan for summer uh so I've been like hardcore tooling up on my Japanese uh usage and and vocabulary and stuff but but yeah and if you hear my kids uh in the background they're very excited to be home after a long day of school so uh yeah that's super chill that you were able to like learn uh one thing that a lot of people may not understand is like the Australian economy and is like almost like closer and more interlined with like Japan and and China and and countries over in Asia than it is with like North America and Europe I mean would you say that's that's accurate just because of the location the time zones yeah I think so yeah we definitely have I I don't I'm not qu quite really well versed on um political relations between other countries but um yeah we definitely do a lot of trade with China I think a lot of our um and in Japan actually my brother is an accountant who um uh who audits large companies in Australia and um there was this one uh Meat Company so we have a lot of Outback and land so Farms to to raise cattle and whatnot and uh my brother was working on the their case and he said that they export they had one customer from Japan who who who runs like this really nice restaurant in Japan flew to Australia and bought $25 million worth of meat to ship back to Japan so that's just like one one customer so um I was like w um CU he had to come to Australia to see it in person to make sure it was high enough quality for the restaurant and so I'm just imagining if that's just if that's one customer who like running a highend restaurant in Japan like imagine how many other deals are going on in other areas so uh yeah we definitely definitely have a lot of exports I know we we export a lot of wine and whatnot to to China and that sort of stuff so yeah and and I mean this podcast isn't about Australia but but I do want to note for a lot of people they they may not realize just the population of Australia is pretty small it's like maybe 25 30 million people like uh that's it yeah 25 it might not even be 25 I think it just under 25 I I but yeah it's definitely around that Brisbane the city that I live in is like 2 to 2 A2 million I think Sydney is number one at about 3 and 1/2 to 4 million Melbourne's around 3 to 3 and A2 um around that and so that's about over 50% of the population is just on the east coast in three major cities uh and then so it's yeah decreasing after that so yeah and to put that in context that's smaller than the population of Texas just one of the 56 one of the bigger yeah uh W just Texas yeah oh my goodness yeah uh so so it's like we hear all this stuff about Australia of course it's like a big pop cult like so many amazing musicians especially from the past 15 years or so have come out of Australia but it's actually not that many people especially when you compare to like China the big you know economic superpower of the region over there right we're small but Marty you know down here in Australia the way down yeah very cool so uh that's so cool so you got to learn some language and I just want to back up and talk about th those two meta skills you talk about learning how to learn and then learning how to take what You' just learned and communicate it to people like you may have not realized it at the time but you were basically learning everything you needed to know to be a successful tutorial Creator probably like would would you say that's the case yeah so I didn't even yeah it's it's again hindsight's 2020 right you can look back and go wow that's that's how you can apply that to this um and so that's that's a really hard thing when when people say oh you need experience for for jobs and whatnot and it's like it's sometimes the experience that you have isn't that quantifiable um whereas like yeah if I have a degree in in XY Z that's really quantifiable but then there's other things like I've talked to 5,000 people I'm not sure how many resumés um like you'll see that sort of as a extra curriculum kind of thing if you know what I mean yeah but also my my dad was a teacher and so I kind of I guess just that was just in nature and nurture as I was growing up and um we ran a family swim school like that was our family business and so I was a swimming coach from basically um 13 onwards growing up in the business and just interacting with with customers um of our of our business and learning how to teach teach swimming to to children and people the same age as me and so I feel like looking back it's it's yeah you you kind of realize it's like oh that actually helped for this that actually helped for that and you kind of piece the puzzle together yeah yeah well uh that's so cool it sounds like you had like a pretty industrious upbringing I didn't even realize you were like a swim instructor I guess all the water around it makes sense to get really good at swimming I don't I don't like pools very much anymore though because uh yeah I spent basically every day in a pool for 10 years wow so like one of the things that people enjoy unwinding with you're just dreading it like oh not the pool again they're R just as a kid I was like well as long as if it's fresh water like it's it's like okay but it's like um because chlorine like I was just I just always smelled like chlorine as a kid and I it's just like no I'm like if the pool's chlorine it's like I'll I'll happily skip that I'll just wait till we go to the beach or something yeah so let's talk about you know your progression into the workforce not just as like a Serv sector I mean like that's a really cool thing to be able to CL like I helped 5,000 not just talk to 5,000 people but like helped them solve their problems right at the Apple App Store over the course of like three years uh and sometimes even using foreign languages in the process uh can you talk about like how you ultimately transitioned into software development yeah so okay so 2016 I studied languages working parttime at Apple and then the start of 2017 was when I was like okay I go to I want to I always wanted to like basically code apps or build something that I was like I was using these computers every day and I'm like I want to build something that's like of my own um and so the start of 2017 I think it was about February I was just like I handed in uh my resignation to Apple and um my friend who worked there as well handed in his resonation at the same time and then we're like okay we're going to build we're going to work on a startup together and so this is where free code Camp came into play uh we were learning web development and we were going to the gym and we were like it really sucks that we can't work out together because you go to gym X and I go to gym Y and so we um started to build a website that we were like Airbnb was getting really big and we were like there should be an Airbnb for gyms and so that's what we started to build was any gym and we built out the website it was it wasn't coded from scratch so wasn't quite free code Camp spec it was just WordPress and um like a bunch of different plugins like maps and all these sort of things but we were we were piecing it together it kind of it looked pretty good from a design standpoint but then okay we're like okay now we have this website but now we need customers and so because in again in retrospect I didn't even know that it was a Marketplace um but that's what it was I was just like okay yeah every be like a twosided Marketplace that's what I mean yeah sorry yeah you're right like yeah Airbnb has the marketplace of the the host of people who put up their homes or apartments and that sort of stuff and then it has the the customers who rent space in those and so in our case the host would be the gyms so they would offer their gym space that already exists and the customers would be people like me and my friend who didn't necessarily want a membership there uh like mbnb you don't want to rent the place for a year you just want to stay in there for or and then the same with with anyy was I just want to go for a session and I want that to be easy rather than to walk in sign all the the forms pay the fee get harassed by Gym Consultants or that sort of stuff I just want to pay whatever it is and do one session and be done and so we were thought yeah that's great in our heads yeah I mean I can tell you from having gone to like my friend's gym like I want to be a guest and then like you go you work out for like 20 minutes or something you're like all right let's Jet and then there's a sales guy who Corners you takes you in a room like hey you got to sign up and do like all this gives you the hard cell right like I don't want that I just want to go work out yeah yeah so I feel like there's still there's still room for for some I'm not working on this now like it the startup didn't work because um but I still feel like there's room for it if we could work if you could work out the right model and get the gyms on board and get safety all that sort of jazz ready but we were like okay we've got map we can find gy in a local area using Google Maps API all and then uh we're like well we actually need to get like we can't just have people rocking up to these gyms like we don't have uh like passes or anything and so we like okay we're just going to go on foot and so we just mapped out like a section of the town like near where his apartment was and we're like there's 10 gyms in this area let's just walk to them yeah today and talk to them and again young and naive just like going through like hey this this is this is our cool bit service we want to get you more customers and we started talking to them and then we kind of quickly realized that uh we didn't have a business unless we could get the gyms on board and um we then also realized that after we got pretty close with one of the gym managers and they were sort of like I like this idea but look at this and then they showed us their sort of numbers and they had 2,000 clients signed up but only 100 of them would come more than once a week and so he's he basically told us that their business model depends on people not showing up so I was like because if all 2,000 people came at one point no um the gym would obviously be overrun right and so so it's almost like you're solving a problem that is actually like a feature not a bug of the way the gy work yes and so we wanted more people to come to the gym but they're like we we we don't want more people we want more people sign up and and have those memberships that you forget about and just do the direct debit every week or month or whatever it is and you don't come to the gym and so we were just like oh and then we kind of went to another gym we kind of realized that that's just a repeating function that you get all these people who sign up for the gym at the start of the year and then go five times in January and then basically the the curve just drops off you go four times in February three times in March and then by June you you've forgotten about it and you're doing something else and then of course the hurdle to cancel it is not just like I'd like to cancel my gym membership it's like talk to our sales guy about why you'd like to to uh cancel it and so in theory it was a great business but then in practice it was like oh okay we the gyms depend on people not showing up and so if we were trying to charge a smaller fee for a one off it doesn't help their business yeah I mean like some of these like at least in the US sorry to go on like a long tangent about gyms you're but uh yeah in in the US there was like this big chain of like gyms was like I think it was like balles or something like that and they like signed people up for like these five 10e contracts or something like that and they they literally went out of business and people still had to pay for the next 5 years they're like no longer rendering services but the the contract was so Ironclad that people had to continue to pay for the next 5 years and they didn't get any gy in return it was just going to like the crors of the gym or whatever yeah so uh well that's what I mean it's I Ed the YCA the YMCA here in the US it's it's a charity they probably have them in Australia too it's a charity that was started 150 years ago and uh they may use some pushy techniques but like my experience has been like we just go there uh we we have like a family family membership whenever we travel like over the summer I'll often go to like Asia because my my kids live in Asia or I'm sorry my my my grandparents live in Asia my wife's from China uh we met in grad school and we might like leave and we can just go in and we can freeze the membership for two months and we don't have to pay anything it's not a big deal yeah see and so like I hope more gyms be like adopt that approach of like building up a reputation over like 150 years and like just being a chill wholesome place to work out rather than like being pushy and like using these techniques but I can definitely see based on everything you said that this would be like a nonstarter of a business exactly right like it was so perfect in our heads and then yeah in in reality uh and I think that's like just another again in retrospect like an important thing of like okay well we test as soon as possible in the real world like is does this actually work because many great ideas are in theory but then in in do they translate to reality well yeah we got to test for it right well since we're talking earlier about China and Chinese I will take the opportunity to share one of those beautiful four character idioms in Chinese yeah Z which is close the doors and build the Chariot there was this like old inventor from like ancient China when of course all these like four character idioms came about and uh he had this Vision this kind of like platonic ideal of like what a car should be like the concept car like the uh the Cyber truck of his day right and so he goes in and he like builds it and everything and and he's making all these fine tuns based on his theory he's Theory crafting right but he never actually takes it out on the road and when his Masterpiece is finally done he takes it out on the road just falls apart it doesn't work at all and so he sunk all that time into it he he closed the doors and built the Chariot when he should have been doing what you did very early on which is go out and actually talk to people running the gyms like I could easily see you and your friends spending like months developing this prototype before you went out and got that user research done and so it sounds like you dodged a bullet by just quickly discovering oh this is not like this is not going to happen because the fundamental economics and the incentives of the people in this space dictate that Airbnb for gyms is not like a great idea and I I frequently said Airbnb is not a great idea and I'm amazed that people actually let strangers into their house uh to to stay like for short periods of time when they're not like professional hot tells they know what they're doing you know but um but yeah like like kudos to you for quickly iterating on your idea and and incorporating the feedback so did it become apparent pretty quickly that you should just Scupper this idea and move on to something else yeah it well my memory is probably a bit hazy on exact timelines but let's just say there a few months we probably spent uh a couple of weeks cuz this is we had no jobs it was kind of like um we're living off savings and my friend had an apartment at uh at um West End which is a suburb towards a city in Brisbane and I was just like basically sleeping on his couch and um studying through the day trying to build this website and then because he lived close to a few gyms we went around and we're like well we should probably test this quite quickly um because we we wanted to start making money uh because again we had no jobs and we were just living off savings um yeah so we found out I would say it was definely not longer than 6 months and probably closer to 3 to 4 that we were we were working on that um because the website truth be told was quite simplistic you had a a place to sign up for customers and a place to find gyms and then a place for um again we probably have to work out a lot of the payment system as it worked but it's like no point having a great payment system if no money is slowing through right so you you it sounds like this was like the mother of all kind of practice projects like you were getting to turn around and apply your nent coding skills to immediately build out this product and and you know yeah well it was a problem that we had like it was like there was a group of us at at working at the Apple Store that would um like we were all in the gym but because it the store was in the middle of the city you had people who lived everywhere around the city and so it was unfeasible to always just go One Direction we just wanted to stay in the city and go somewhere just local so it just made sense to us of like like as if you'd go to a restaurant you just walk in and buy a meal we're like we want that we want that workflow to to work for gyms instead of yeah walk in sign the form get 100 text messages from someone asking you if you want to sign up which is like no a simple transaction you know and like I think Apple pay was out by that stage I'm not entirely sure so it's like it could just be a past that you just walk in and scan yeah anyway that was maybe maybe it could work these days I think class pass is like another big startup that was doing something similar I think they they actually got funding and maybe made it to profitability I'm not entirely sure but uh that that was yeah my my dive into web development and then pretty quickly after that I uh realized that web development for me was far too tedious I'm like I want to do programming cuz I was like I have to build the workflow for that to go to there to go to there that to go to there like just every every block like again this is my laziness kicking in I was like how could I the whole point of this was to automate the stuff but right now I'm just building everything step by step and then of course machine learning was uh before it was really called AI it was was on the rise and then uh um basically every Tech podcast that I listen to um or YouTube video that I watched was about technology and then someone would talk about uh machine learning and then I was like what is this and then I started to of research into machine learning and then I was like oh so you just tell the computer here's my stuff you learn the patents and I was like yeah that's that's what I'm talking about that's what I want to use computers for so it's like that that laziness creeping back in like computer do the hard work for me you do the work yeah exactly um and so yeah that just began the fascination I think I probably discovered it properly in the middle of 2017 cuz I left Apple it started 2017 and then uh we we worked on the startup for a few months caned it because yeah it's like well we've spoken to enough gyms now I bet you this is the case around every gym um and also we're we're young and naive I'm like 24 or 25 or whatnot and have no money so it's like if we had millions of funding we could probably sway the gyms in some way but we were like bootstrapping the whole thing yeah anyway um we yeah so middle of 2017 start get into machine learning and on the weekends I was driving Uber so to support myself so I was still living at home with my parents and um so I had a a pretty strict routine for I guess 9 to 12 months of just Monday to Friday study study machine learning and Friday night Saturday afternoon tonight and Sunday morning is Drive Uber because they were the best they were the best days in terms of economics Friday night everyone's going out Sly so I was a Hermit for like a good a good solid year um and this is where I sort of middle of 2017 discovered like machine learning end of 2017 like September or close to the end I created my own AI master's degree which was just I'd kind of done enough two to three months of like Foundation stuff in terms of to realize what was the the the overarching um skills needed for it then I'm okay well I've got this skill of learning how to learn so I'm just going to create my own curriculum using online resources um that are kind of just a collation of I guess lists of of AI resources that I'm like these look like pretty good and I just put them in a just a blog post of basically I don't know let's say 10 resources the number is a bit arbitrary it's still on my website and I'm like okay over the next and I was publishing it publicly on M to basically no one but I wanted to just have a public record to keep me accountable so I'm like over the next X amount of time I'm going to go through these resources and get these skills and then I'll just get a job in machine learning that was my my thinking so you were using like your blog post and social media as a kind of an accountability mechanism to uh to like a commitment device essentially like I'm going to learn all this stuff and everybody's like good luck I'll look forward to hearing about the results of you learning all this stuff and then you're like oh damn I can't quit now everybody's waiting for me to share my results yeah well that's that's exact 100% that's exactly what I what I what I wanted to do and well one because yeah accountability two because I'm a very sort of I like interacting with other people who are interested in uh I think that's quite natural to just interact with people who are interested in what you're interested in yeah and uh this is 2017 so machine learning and Al is nowhere near as popular as it is now it was certainly gaining traction but C certainly when chat GPD came out everybody updated their LinkedIn profile HEI exactly or machine learning engine no longer yeah I had to update all my courses you know it's no longer teaching machine learning it's teaching Ai and machine learning um but uh but yeah the fundamental that isn't a marketing gimmick by the way that's the fun the fundamental Technologies are still the same between machine learning and ai ai is just a sort of yeah a bit more of a hyped up term at the moment um but yeah and it wasn't for a long time by the way a lot of people like so a little history lesson AI has like Winters and Summers right so like in the 1950s the US government's like we think we can create like human level intelligence within like 10 months or something with this team of like University researchers and of course that didn't work out right uh and then later they're like oh well now we've got an AI that can beat Gary Casp a chess you know blue IBM right or we've got Watson that can beat everybody at Jeopardy because it can hit the buzzer at superhuman rates before people can even hit their buzzer so they can't compete with it right like you know like like there all these like we we've had many yeah you're right I think it's almost 10 to 15 years we get yeah a new technology that's going to uh replace humans um so that's yeah that's very well you're right that's very well historically documented right back from like yeah the 20s almost um and then mechan now we can just get this to do it by itself without having a c underneath the the chess player right but uh sorry for like going off on a tangent I think it's that's important to have context yeah yeah cuz machine learning engineer for a while was like basically machine learning you'd say that instead of AI because I there was a stigma associated with AI because AI had disappointed so many people let people down you keep saying that like you know how 9000 is just around the corner the sky just around the corner and yet you know this AI can barely do anything you know so people like were oversold like and you could say to some extent there's so much hyper on AI uh that we being oversold right now but at the same time I use you know GPT 4 all the time like I use it several times a day there's something there there right uh it's not all just you know Sizzle and no steak this time it's there is real utility I totally agree yeah the same with me like I use AI tools uh I think now it's a lot more um customer facing as in like it's it's you can you can see what's happening with with AI tools now whereas in the background with predictive models so generative models the difference between predictive and AI uh sorry predictive Ai and generative AI predictive your sort of predicting is your email spam or not spam as in it's it's a set number of of classes um there's a a confined output whereas generative is kind of the out outut space is almost infinite it's still constra constrained to the distribution of of data that the model has seen but it's certainly a lot wider than just a a a unique set of of different labels so now um for the last I guess maybe 8 10 years we've had predictive AI running behind the scenes um for credit card transactions for battery optimization for email classification for uh audio quality optimization but all these things are sort of behind the scenes whereas now I feel like the reason why it's it's getting a lot more traction now is because it's generative we can all interact with it with language with image and soon many more modalities yeah yeah it's super duper exciting and I I don't mean to like uh denigrate like the effort of all the AI engineering and all the breakthroughs and everything uh I just wanted to point out that like the machine machine learning term it's synonymous with AI right would you say that's that's accurate yes well that's yeah that's that's how I use it I guess you'd probably have people who who want to sort of Define it a bit more but like to me it's like there's one big umbrella up the top and that's AI artificial intelligence actually funny story about AI I told my grandfather um a few years ago when I was first studying Ai and he he thought it was artificial insemination which is um yes something related to impregnate cattles yeah artificially but no it's like no it's it's to do with uh technology so that just goes to show like how quickly technology can change that's like only two generations like my granddad to my parents to me and it's like all of a sudden we have totally new nures for for different paradigms uh anyway AI is up top for me at the big umbrella and then under that is machine learning and then under that is deep learning and so really if we're being really specific all of the AI that's currently generative AI is been powered by Deep learning um and so that's a subset of machine learning and machine learning is a subset of the field of AR okay yeah a great little kind of like pyramid if you want to think about those different terms and how they relate to one another one question a lot of people ask me is data science how is that related to AI yes so data science would be to me is is in I guess a part of AI as well um cuz AI is just I mean what's intelligence it's yeah it's pretty broad right so data science to me is using data to predict things so you're you're trying to formulate hypothesis and seeing if the the data falsifies it or proves it uh somewhat correct and so whereas data analytics is you're analyzing the past so data science to me is predicting the future data analytics analyze the past so what has happened that's a little Nuance that I sort of that helps me get through that and then within data science if you're trying to predict the future Based on data uh one of the techniques you can use is machine learning so you you get you write an algorithm that is going to sift through much more data than any one person could ever look at and try to form a predictive model so that given a similar source of data You can predict something in the future yeah now again it's all probably istic so it's not it's not a magic box um but it can sort of give you some insight into what it might be yeah and so for example like uh one application of you know predictive models would be figuring out what the next good move is in a game of Go uh you know the game with the stones for example like the the the Deep Mind alphao um algorithm uh AI system whatever you want to call it that was able to master this ancient Chinese game that's like 5,000 years old that has that is you know many many orders of magnitude more complicated than chess in terms of the possible moves you can make and the complexity of different strategies and everything like that and my understanding is they took a huge data set of previously played go games that have been recorded step by step just like with chess they've got like their notation to record like who move where and put stones we and essentially they use that as the training data and so initially like that whole model is to predict what the next like the highest confidence interval or like the highest you know expected value uh move is when you're putting a piece on the go board right um and so so we're talking about superhuman data like you could be a go encyclopedic you know go player you could potentially even have like some sort of neuro Divergent Quirk where you could literally remember full games of go but you wouldn't be able to like consume the entire Corpus of all the games that these AI systems can consume and eventually they stopped even feeding it trading data and they just like had it play against itself a whole lot for hundreds of years s simulated right it does not matter how smart you are you cannot play against yourself for hundreds of years because you're going to die all right so so yeah so when we talk about superhuman you know models and like these can do useful things that humans simply cannot do there are real world limitations on the exent of like human intelligence right uh so that that's what's so exciting about it for me like watching like the the go uh or watching like the AI that plays Starcraft against the best you know Korean Starcraft players and stuff like that and like just the applications of these to see interesting things that come out uh that that I think is like that is what really gets me hyped up uh as somebody who enjoys games and stuff well the StarCraft one to me is is really fascinating cuz that in requires like team interaction versus like uh the go one is obviously very impressive but it's it's sort of you your your solo and your your board state is is influenced sure you're influenced by an opposition but you're largely your actions influence the board State as well but then you have like um uh what was it called or DOTA sorry or Starcraft what where you have a team of five versus another team of five and it's like okay now you have multiple people influencing multiple things and like these people if you if you're like a a newcomer you you could play Dota or Starcraft for 5 years but then someone who's an expert at it just comes and wipes the floor with you like and you have zero chance but then these AIS can can train for a month in computer simulator time and then they're going up against the world champions who are so far removed from the average player it's it's ridiculous but then the the AI is catching up in in a month of simulation yeah yeah I mean it really it it's probably a foregone conclusion that we have artificial general intelligence given like the constraints of just the human mind and the fact that like we're working with something that evolved to like find calories and like avoid predators and stuff and they're working with like basically the fruits of like the finest engineering Minds from the past you know 100 years and then all the mathematicians and philosophers and everybody else that was also kind of like seminal in in creating the uh the Corpus upon which like those Technologies sit upon right like yeah I mean I would be really amazed if we didn't have systems that were way smarter than human beings within the next 50 or 100 years in some Dimensions I'm I'm not sure that we'll have uh you know what are your thoughts on uh so so we can talk a lot more about AI cuz one of the things I want to talk about is how should somebody approach learning these things because frankly I think everybody who's interested in technology should learn about these things um and but the question is how do they go about doing it you just did that what would be your high level advice to people who want to just start let's say they just know a little bit about programming technology they know how to use you know a browser maybe they know a little bit of like a scripting language like python maybe they've used Microsoft Access or even SQL or something like like that so they have like basic knowledge of like how to get stuff done with computers how do they go from there to where you are in terms of building your own models and and uh you know getting things done with these tools well I feel like yeah there's almost an unlimited amount of approaches but I if you're just let's say you're just comfortable using a computer but you want to you know you want to get into using AI stuff I would say that the the the tri entry array the way that I did it was just relentlessly follow your curiosity and it sounds like trite but it's like that's just going to fuel you through like I had to do it in a I realized that my I needed a sort of structured curiosity following uh that's why I created my own uh rough path of like courses to follow to build a um a foundational knowledge and then after that I just once I'd had the foundational knowledge I just went and go I'm going to just relentlessly follow this so that was my path and I feel like that's obviously unbiased but I feel like if you're if you don't want to go to to college or back to school or whatnot the the resources on the internet are the best you're going to get especially in this new field well not new field but in the current climate of AI the universities and colleges just don't catch up as fast as the the field moves however that does not to say if you're already involved in a computer science or mathematic or some sort of technology related or any actually any related um uh degree or something at school because these Technologies are so wide ranging uh I am actually of a big uh like in big favor of we need people who are well trained in nontechnological backgrounds to pick up these skills so that it's not just a bunch of computer nerds running the the AI world we need people who are wellversed in many different fields uh offering Insight because what what a lot of Engineers and I'm guilty of this and people who are in Tech uh sort of one downside is that they again they build Solutions because that's what they like to do they're Engineers but then the solutions don't map to the actual real world like um like say for example a healthcare solution um was built by Engineers but then you you start to talk to nurses and people who actually provide Healthcare and they say that's just not going to work because we have to I remember in my machine learning job perfect case of this is that we were before uh transcription got really quite good like as it is now you can download a model from hugging face and you can get almost Flawless transcription at least definitely usable transcription uh we were building models to transcribe doctor's notes um as in so you go to a doctor's appointment and instead of the doctor there typing on the keyboard uh while you're talking it would just automatically write down what you were speaking so you had a record there yeah so we're building this system the model worked pretty good um at least good for 2018 standards and then we went to deliver it to the the system and we kind of I was speaking to the business Dev or the business person that was running it and their whole goal was to they they found out that on average a doctor spends 5 minutes during each appointment to type notes and they wanted to make that basically zero and that way a doctor could see like three more patients a day if you add that up and just and just in my head I'm like sort of okay that works fantastic from an economic standpoint but I'm like why do people go to the doctor in the first place I actually asked that in the meeting and uh I kind of got looked at looked at like very like what are you talking about like what what of course people go to a doctor cuz they're sick and I'm like yeah they might be sick but they're also going for empathy and to to chat with another human being and if we're just basically going oh yeah you sa 5 minutes so now you can see three more patients a day it's just like a a factory line of like people in and out maybe that extra 5 minutes the doctor could actually talk to the person of like how's your family how's your how's your wife how's your kids um all that sort of stuff and like get to know the person and uh again it can't be proven in like medical terms but the spiritual sort of side of me feels like that that is almost as healing as like prescribing a a drug or a treatment of just someone caring about your problem the whole notion of bedside manner from your doctor essentially like they they that they care that they're not just that you're not just numbers on a chart that you're not just like this graph or this uh scan that they're looking at oh blah blah blah blah blah like they actually look at you they actually connect with you I mean that's like you know I've changed doctors a lot over the years and that's one of the most common reasons like it doesn't seem like they even give a damn about me like I'm just another you know appointment and they got to dash out the door to the next one they don't even bother sitting down you know like those are all flags for me red flags that I need to find a different you know primary care physician so yeah uh and and those are the kinds of things that you learn from being out in the field you know not building The Chariot behind closed doors but actually going out there but but was that the lesson of what you were trying to tell or or was it something different like well that's what I was saying it's like don't if you want to get into the yeah so the initial question was yeah how to best get into it and again I don't have the best I only really have my uh experience and my experience is uh there are a lot of things that you'll see in the in the tech field that are sort of almost too techy as in like you'll you'll you can yes there are fundamental skills that you you are going to have to learn which is uh programming in some sense and the language of AI at the moment is Python programming language you you basically can't go wrong if you start with that um and then writing C A lot of people tell me oh I'm scared of the math of AI and ML and uh it is all math I'm not going to talk away from that it is writing computer code to trigger math at scale that's that's like AI algorithms in a nutshell however these days I deal with 99% code rather than than math so I'm I I'm not an expert in math I don't have a background I don't have mathematics degree but I can write um computer code to to run that math and the computer is going to implement that for me and so I'm more interested in the Practical side of writing the code to to implement things then U doing the research into the mathematical foundations of the algorithm um to find new algorithms I'm more interested in applying existing techniques to things that I find interesting rather than Reinventing completely new techniques so there's two kind of sides to it a lot a lot gets uh in the there's kind of the the AI and machine learning research and I would say if you want to go into that and be a researcher um you're going to need to to learn the mathematics inside and out because that's what the the researchers doing and and let's say if you want to do research is that like you should just stay at a university generally or best yes that would be the best path for again you can there is no the internet there is no limits there's a website called archive which is ax X i.org which basically all the new machine learning research gets published to that and it's free so truly if you just wanted to sit at home and you you you have hours per day to read through archive you can just create your own selfstudy um like Facebook Google uh MIT Stanford all publish their research papers to Archive and then the code will be on GitHub so if you want to just really just find your own self way and then there's communities on Discord these days which are like basically all of those resources are completely free so if you have the discipline to go through that yourself um by all means but if you're just getting started you're at college already you're studying a technology thing mathematics whatnot you want to go to research uh I would stick with that path but then also just just always remember that um there are resources outside of college that are very ible um so that's a research side of things but practicality wise I would say if you come from a different background that's also really cool because now you have a different set of knowledge uh that you can sort of start to see what AI is capable of and go how can I apply this to my current field and that's kind of what what I I'm doing now as in I studied um food science and nutrition at University and now my brother and I are working on a startup called nutrify which is uh at the moment it's a like a Pokédex for food so or Shazam for food you take a photo of food and it will tell you about it so it uses computer vision and then maps that to nutrition data and then you can create a food diary get nutritional insights from from that so that's my practical standpoint is I have studied food science and nutrition and now I've kind of got versed in AI Technologies I'm trying to marry the two yeah um so that's kind of the between like research is is the Academic Way of like um you're just trying to push the field forward in terms of um studying new algorithms building new algorithms going through research papers and trying to collate the best things and again it's a very big overlap too with with the Practical side of things of building a solution that other people can actually use but I would say the the building the Practical solution that other people can use is a lot more code heavy versus the research is still Codey but also there's a lot more math involved yeah so like you know free camp for example we're teaching Applied Mathematics and it's always got to focus on okay how do you actually implement this in Python uh so if you look at the the algebra course that we published a few months ago and we've got a precalculus course coming in a couple months and we're going to have all the engineering math that you would get at like an you know at a big top computer science program here in the US would be like MIT Caltech Stanford uh but um um what we're doing is instead of focusing on like okay let's draw out all these formulas on the Whiteboard and stuff like that you still kind of learn that but it's all about okay let's implement this in code because any mathematical expression can be implemented in code uh right like you see that summation symbol the big scary I think it's like an Epsilon I can't remember all the Greek letters but like that's just a for right um yeah so like and like all these different uh variables you pull in and stuff like order of operations all stuff that's all code right you can Implement math in code and python as you said is like the the language dour people aren't using r as much or Julia Lang or these other computational languages I mean you can certainly use that but you can't go wrong with python there's like python libraries for pretty much everything right that you need to do in machine learning yeah and I feel like yeah the the language of AI these days is is or the framework of AI and deep learning is pi torch and the pi is python so um yeah pytorch is a framework for deep learning and it's all all accessible in Python you can WR you can write machine learning code in basically any programming language but uh python is is where you want to be if you're starting from zero and learning to to program like today or learning to code I would 100% recommend python yeah and you know pytorch like so that's like the Facebook open source project uh for machine learning and then there's also tensorflow which we have courses on both uh which is also another python uh machine learning library that's created by Google and you know all these tools are like open source they're free you don't have to pay for mat lab or you know like a site license or or like a lot of these other tools that are frankly pretty expensive like like uh and the python ecosystem is just amazing so yeah I I think it's cool that you do so much and you have tutorials on so many of these tools in Python uh you know your most popular video ever I think is a pytorch video and one of your other most popular videos is a tensor flow these are like yeah 10hour videos 25h hour videos that are literally in a day yeah literally a day like just drink drink drink your energy drink and and get your crack your knuckles and let's let's do some uh machine learning right so I want to fire off lot of questions so just to recap what you're were saying because you had so many insights there and I I want to try to like break it down for everybody listening so there's the applied side the engineering side and then there's the science side if you want to be an engineer start engineering right start grabbing tools off the shelf and start applying them to problems if you want to be a scientist there's something to be said for being in the Ivory Tower and going to just get a PhD but there are sites like AR archive I'm not sure exactly howc yeah like uh I think it's like from a Cornell or something like that like I'll link to that in the show notes we're going to put links to a lot of stuff we talk about in the show notes uh in the video description if you're watching this on YouTube but uh one of the interesting things that I think you said is whatever domain expertise you already have in your case nutrition you can bring that from wherever you are learning to code is kind of a skill that you layer on top of your existing domain expertise like I'm a teacher I was a school director right like uh learning the code for me was just a skill that would allow me to get new things done as a teacher right like free C Camp is partially like I'm I'm just one of many many many people who've worked on free C Camp but it's like an expression of my interest in education and you know apply like applying that using coding right same thing with like learning a foreign language you're just allowing yourself to go and do whatever it is you you do if you're a doctor and you learn Spanish bam now you can go to like Latin America and help people right right if there's like an earthquake there you can potentially go down there and be a relief worker or something like that right so it's just another tool through which you can express your expertise and and so I think it's really interesting that you have this domain expertise that you already built up and you're still in the space you're still building you know health and nutrition Wellness type tools but you're applying the machine learning skills that you have to get those things done that's so cool yeah so uh I want to just fire off a lot of really quick questions so thing that like people always say to me is like oh I want to do machine learning but I don't have the GPU or whatever like uh it used to be like coding I'm like oh cool like I used like a a netbook which was like 300 bucks it had 2 gigabytes of RAM and like I used that for like two or three years when I first started learning the code learning the code technically you don't really need a lot of computational power you're just you know writing loops and like building algorithms and data structures and stuff but with machine learning you do kind of need some Hardware to get somewhere right yeah so I would say yeah if you're okay let's let's just talk from from beginner level like if you're if you're just getting into programming uh any any modern laptop will do a MacBook Air or um I'm not quite I've been using Apple for a while now so I'm not quite familiar with the the the most recent Windows laptops but um anyone of those will do so you can you can get started learning all the basic sort of stuff but then as you no I don't want I don't want to downplay it and say that it's basic you can you can get quite far using uh a standard desktop machine but then if you want to start getting into more and more advanced um using bigger models training your own uh stateoftheart AI models then that's where you're going to need more compute power um so for example I do 90% of my work day today on a M1 MacBook Pro but then when I train deep learning models and so sorry if there's a car starting that's my housemate leaving um when I train deep learning models I I write the code on my MacBook Pro but then it it sends it to I've got a a PC in my closet with a big GPU in there and it trains the model on there and then I take the model from that and I deploy it to a smartphone in the case of nutrify but then if you want to go even higher to build something like chat gbt you're going to need uh a warehouse for the of computers and so there's there's quite a large scale there however if you're I I I tend to towards like all my courses are beginner friendly right so I tend to I I like I'm a big advocate for the little guy you know the person hacking around on their their computer and trying to build something that can scale to a million people if you really wanted it to and so uh I don't have access to thousands of gpus like meta Facebook Microsoft oh meta and Facebook the same people anyway I don't have access to a warehouse of computers so I'm mainly interested in and the field this is a little bit kind of um it's something you kind I I don't realize it cuz I'm so embedded in the field but it's something that you it's a really big blessing uh when you get into the field is that a lot of there's such an open culture in uh machine learning like most as I said most of the research papers um are published free to read which is actually quite different to a lot of other fields and a lot of the the research papers come with the code so here's the code you can run on your own computer to implement it and then finally here is the trained model that you can uh use on your own computer so you may not necessarily and the benefit of this is that the trained model they may have been trained by researchers using uh let's say 10 or eight Nvidia gpus that are worth $220,000 each so it's $160,000 machine it's trained for 3 days on that machine they're going to release that model for you so you don't have to repeat the training you've already got the finished product and you can apply that on your machine now whether you'll be able to run that at scale is another question so there's kind of this is quite a bit of rabbit hole but I'll just keep going with it is that what I'm saying is you can have a a consumer level machine and then run these models that larger Enterprises have released and then you can start to build with things like that and so one of the biggest expenses in compute power for a machine learning model or deep learning model is the pretraining so training it and that the pretraining is the p in GPT so pretraining that can often take weeks and months for some models um literally weeks and months of time so you'll have in the case of GPT uh I don't think they release the exact numbers but I feel like having a computer like a th000 gpus or maybe more 10,000 running simultaneously for 3 months is not an understatement so that just goes to show you billions of dollars to train these models in some cases we're not yeah we'll be in the billions soon um I think the billion dollar training run will probably happen in the next 3 years or so but um definitely multi multimillions like we're talk I think Lama 2 from Facebook was like a $10 million training run um and so then now we can use uh with Frameworks like mlx from from Apple we can run those models on MacBooks so that's that's really cool and then you have other tools like if you're running on a consumer machine you can go to uh Google collab which is a free resource basically like Google Docs but um for computing and you can run python code you can access uh free gpus so a GPU is a graphical processing unit that is very good at doing parallel computations which is what you need to do in machine learning you need to run numerical calculations and you need to do a lot of them to find patterns in data and so gpus just happen to be really good at doing many computations simultaneously so you can find those patterns faster and so um Frameworks like pytorch allow you to build models load models and you got hugging face Transformers free open source Library you can load pretrained models into your Google coab instance and then start to build from there so as a practical example um um the other day like my friend works for an insurance company and um one of their big problems is H I'm getting fireworks on my thing your Apple gestures thing turned on for anybody who listening to the audio version you have to turn that off if you use an apple if you do double thumbs up and you have it turned on which it is by default you'll see like these fireworks so I didn't even know just triggered that that's hilarious it's a delightful way to learn about it in real time sorry just had fireworks behind me yeah so you were talking about your friend at the insurance C yes so um he was using uh Google collab to do some research on um the insurance document so as you can imagine insurance companies have a lot of files and a lot of sort of uh information cases to dig through and then he was using Google collab to download a pretrained language model to um basically read through email threads to to find find like who was at fault who was um uh the person making the claim uh what was the amount what was the date and then structure that data from uh from just raw text of the email thread which is kind of very tedious to go through then would have the language model automatically turn that into Json which is a structured data pattern which is uh much easier to navigate so that's just like one one of many many examples of how someone from like an insurance like uh field not not exactly fully related to AI can start to use AI tools to to help them for their workflow yeah I mean just like software in general like anything you're doing that is tedious that you can describe really well historically you wouldn't necessarily be able to do that you might be able to describe in great detail exactly how you look at different photos and determine whether they need moderator attention or not right like if you let's say you work in one of Facebook's many like moderator kind of like data center or call center type places uh where you're like going through and like checking every photo that uh somebody has flagged on Facebook for example like you might be able to very accurately describe using words how you would go about determining whether a photo was inappropriate and needed to be removed but it was very hard to teach a computer to do that until now now it's like we've got like so much more powerful models and it's just like that that like kind of evolutionary leap and so now now like I would never have trusted a computer to like look at a thread of emails and figure out who was at fault or like pull out all these San details because human language is so complicated and everything like five years ago I wouldn't just thought oh yeah like I'm not even going to attempt to write that kind of program it would just not work yeah even even two years ago like this is this is really sort of new stuff that we're kind of um yeah we're still figuring out the the exact use cases that um all the the new tools generative AI there's like no real it's not an understatement to say that yeah in the last two years the it went from basically not working to working really really well so and of course it's still like there's it's not perfect but I mean that's the nature of machine learning it's it's probabilistic it's never going to be 100% perfect um but it can definitely be useful yeah and and that is why all the hoopla all the hubub about AI all of a sudden is because it's it's not just hype uh there have been some major breakthroughs that you and I are using like free Camp uses AI like everybody I know who's a software engineer is like learning how to work these into the workflows it's a new tool in your toolbox that you can pull out for novel types of problems that before you just had to you know use regx and pre essentially or something like that right I I feel like yeah I feel like now is I I get a question quite often is like should I even start now because of AI just like coming in and just changing everything and I I was I'm a big Advocate um of like now is again it sounds TR but it's like now is like one of the best times ever to learn to code because the tools are so helpful um and like there's a difference like there's a kind of a niche difference between like coding and programming like I would say uh like programming to me is just thinking like a lot of my time I think if if people get the um the idea of like if you're a software engineer you just spend all day um writing code I would say now majority like I do write a lot of code however uh I use AI tools such as GitHub copilot to write a lot of the boilerplate but for the stuff that I have to think out um that's mostly thought of like I've got a a text document here where I've just been collecting ideas on a workflow that i' I'd like to be implementing and I've been refining that workflow in my head not not writing any any code yet and then go okay that might work that might work and then I write the code to test the workflow and all the boilerplate stuff is is is helped with AI tools and what I mean by boiler plate that's another term in the industry of like really tedious stuff that you kind of um you're not really thinking about when you write it but you have it has to be there to get started so it's like the I guess the if you're writing an assignment it's like the the structure of the assignment it like needs to needs to be there to start but it doesn't really take much thought but it is tedious to get and so AI tools now are very good at that but for like specific workflows um that still requires programming which is very thoughtful um and a lot of the time is is a lot of the code actually you'll write 1,000 lines of code but then you'll delete 700 because um you don't actually need them and it's more efficient the way you're doing it the first time is really rough um that's really big thing in machine learning is you'll you'll write like a thousand different experiments and maybe 10 of them work quite well and you'll start to pursue those so a lot of my day is spent yes writing code but now ai tools write a lot of that Baseline stuff for me um I still know I could if I didn't have the AI tool this is another important point is that if I didn't have the AI tool I'd still be able to write it I would just it would just um take me longer uh if that makes sense so um to the people who yeah who ask who ask me and this is what I reply with is that it's it's actually a really great time to start learning to code because the the the really big hurdle when you're starting is that it's you have to learn you're learning a new language and then um like it's like learning Chinese learning Japanese but then once once you get over that that big hurdle of the momentum of like just learning the the syntax of like what goes where where it goes then you can start to okay you don't have to use such a big thought process just to get the syntax out you can write the thing and keep going uh and so AI tools are really really good like chat GPT Gemini I mean there's half a dozen of these chat Bots now um at writing fundamental python code and so if you have an error in Python which is the language of machine learning they're incredibly helpful for debugging it um and almost instantaneously whereas in the the past you'd have to really quite get good at searching and reading documentation and whatnot that's that's not to say that's not still a valuable skill but especially for that just that initial hurdle of learning something completely new they're really really good for that and then once you've got some momentum you can start to apply your skills there's always going to be that sort of um uh time where you need you you can't necessarily use a chat assistant or whatnot or an AI tool is that you're going to basically have to delve into the documentation of something that's new and hasn't been around for a while and you need to to just basically whack your head up against the wall and figure it out like take some time um yeah I mean there there aren't really any shortcuts like you said like all the stuff you're talking about doing you're still the problem solver you're just using these tools as a way to solve the problem but if if you look at the code is like very succinct instructions for what to do like yes the machine is very good at like figuring out like from its massive Corpus like copilot has I don't know hundreds of thousands millions of code examples from python for implementing similar types of functions or something that it can draw from to create uh similar type boiler plate uh but at the end of the day like figuring out what work needs to be done and like the the high level thinking you still need human intellect to do that and I don't think that's going to change dramatically anytime soon like I always say this like you watch Star Trek and the computer doesn't just do everything it doesn't just run the ship everything's done like the humans don't do anything no the humans are doing lots of things they're figuring out where to go they're figuring out what is important uh they're asking questions of the computer they're they're creating new programs within the computer to get things done and of course that's just a science fiction show written in like the' 60s 7s 90s um you know but I think it's it's a pretty accurate assessment of like where technology ultimately going it's just yet stronger tools yet longer levers for us to use to get more work done as empowered individuals so yeah I just want to quickly second what you just said Daniel I think it's more important than ever that people learn how to code and uh people worry like oh but like what if you know the jobs are taken by technology like the people the nutritionists who know how to use machine learning the nutritionists who know how to to get things done with computers are going to be much more competitive than the ones that just throw up their hands in Despair and say oh I don't need to learn that stuff or I'm not smart enough to learn that stuff right same thing with teachers who learn technology same thing with um you know doctors who learn how to use these Technologies like everybody in society can really benefit from layering this skill set on top of their domain expertise and on top of you know their profession their trade so um couple just fire questions man I just want to like make good use of your time first of all thanks again for waking up super duper early right what time is it over there uh it's 851 now but I was yeah it was uh I know we had a couple of technical delays on my end but it was um yeah starting nice and early 600 a.m. 630 so Google collab you mentioned that I just want to say if you use the free Camp curriculum we make heavy use of Google collab uh for our machine learning section amazing Tool uh it's basically just an implementation of jupyter notebook which is a popular open source python yeah that's correct um and then uh I've been taking detailed notes as you you talk one other thing that uh I think is is kind of cool that uh you know you've created this like I don't know have you done it every year but like the state of AI like what you need to learn in 2022 you know like like you create these comprehensive learning paths have you created one for 2024 yet not it's not every year because I didn't want to um one it took me a long time to do but another one is like it almost like because it was changing so fast the last couple of years I uh I've held off on my most recent one so I think um I don't want to make promises but there's there's like I've definitely got a note of like uh research and and whatnot of what I'd like to include in the next version and I think this may be the you the 2024 2025 and for the next couple of years and whatnot onwards um but yeah it was it was sort of a resource that I'd like to have so that was the 2020 machine learning road map and that sort of stayed valid like 95% valid up until about the launch of chat GPT and then it was like maybe 80% valid because it it and again when I say valid it doesn't mean that the material is invalid it's that it's it's missing a few of the newer things that are available if that makes sense so um the materials are still very valid for like the majority of the um uh pre generative AI sort of Boom but um the next one will sort of definitely have a lot more inform about generative AI tools cuz as I said it was up until about 2 years ago that they essentially didn't work very well at all and then it's like now they work really well so well we use them yeah exactly right yeah well I I think it goes without saying that if you do want to create like a 2025 Edition I always like to to joke that like you can release the 2025 Edition in like September whenever they release like September 2024 2025 Edition cuz that's when they released the 2025 version of cars things like that if you decide to do that that's what I think that's that's that's we'd be like super duper hyped to to post it or cross posted on free C Camp's YouTube channel for the community cuz like I enjoyed watching I I think I watched like two or three hours it was a long video uh and just like seeing you break down all the different fields and how all these disciplines interrelate because one thing you have is you don't have that academic pedigree of I've got a PhD in machine learning from XYZ you know Academy but instead you I mean you're a nutritionist who taught himself all this stuff and so you have that kind of like learning how to learn like in the in the trenches type mentality of like okay here's how I actually get things done here's how like the jobs that I've worked uh the first job you ever got by the way I you got to tell this story you got a your first developer job but you didn't actually apply for it like how did what happened exactly how did you uh how did you get your first job this is why I'm not good at answering the questions of like how to get a job it was um cuz when I got how do I get my first job because like I M was kind of and I just can only really speak to what I actually did was I was just again when I started studying machine learning at AI I created my online pathway and I was just posting on LinkedIn and my blog and medium uh in YouTube of like different different things that I was learning and then uh someone must have found a post on LinkedIn and I guess they were um they knew someone else and they knew that someone else was again this is 2018 so machine learning AI wasn't uh as big as as big as it is now and so they talked to someone else and then I got a a message saying hey do you want to I see you're into this machine learning and stuff do you want to um catch up for coffee and I'm like yeah sure and then I went caught up for coffee and I kind of again impostor syndrome kicks in cuz I'm like like oh wow do I actually have these skills or I'm just talking about them and I spoke with with this person named Mike and uh he he didn't actually know he was learning from me and so I was like oh wow okay um I am actually learning some stuff and then he's like I know someone who I want you to meet and I think like they're if your if your goal is to get a job in the field they can probably help you out too I'm like okay sweet so met this person cam uh two weeks later let's say and then I'm like yeah my goal is like I'm studying online uh just in my bedroom I'm driving Uber on the weekends and I think I'm going to go to the US um in a few months and just find a job like that was literally my plan I was sort of that's that's my sort of happy go lucky L Nature of like I'm just going to fly to the US and I'm going to make it work right and I kind of just had that rational confidence of like this is just going to work out and again that's not to say that there weren't moments of like oh am I doing the right thing am I am I actually going to make it what all this sort of stuff but nonetheless I still just had this deep down confidence that it's like no if I just keep dedicating myself something will happen lo and behold he replies to that with um well have you considered just staying in Australia and I'm like no all this technology stuff is based in the US and he's like no we're actually we've got a like a small company like we're starting to bring machine learning into a austalia and I'm like okay and he's like yeah do you want to come in next Monday and I'm like okay sweet and so I was uh the third machine learning engineer at this um well Machine learning engineer at that stage um at this technology company based in Brisbane and we were a consultancy firm partnering with other big businesses in Australia because machine learning was just taking off with this another writing this hype cycle and so we would go into big businesses like insurance companies Banks uh medical centers and figure out whether machine learning could be applied to their existing problems and so that's where uh that sort of ties back into what I was saying before if you're from other Industries the technology is so widespread now that you can kind of do some research I'm not going to say you're going to have an epiphany straight away but do some research and start to draw patterns uh between what you do day today and what these Technologies are capable of and so it was again luck I of stumbled into it but on one side of it I was also publishing what I was doing quite vigorously online um was it groundbreaking stuff no I was just sharing what I'd learned and so it was almost like leveraging the power of the internet uh to you you never really know what's ever going to happen um so none of my stuff like went super viral or whatnot but that's not I I've never banked on that it was just I was just like I want to uh um progress my skills and put that out there because I know I knew no one and I still know no one really well I know a few people now actually in real life in my like Hometown who was studying machine learning so I'm like I have to find people online um so that was sort of my mentality and that's why I kept like posting things um to sort of uh not necessarily like put my my word out there but also find other people who were interested in it yeah yeah that's really cool um you have said in the past that if if an employer on the on the notion of like chopping around for jobs and trying to find a good employer you said If an employer doesn't think that building projects counts as experience you probably don't want to work there can you tell me a little bit about how you decide like where you want to work and like what you look for in an employer well I've only ever had one machine learning job and then I started to work for myself myself so that and that's actually been my goal the whole time is to start my own company um so I was uh I thought I wanted to work for a big tech company like Facebook or um meta or Google or something like that but then I realized that once I learned more about the lifestyle I was like no that's I I want want to sort of work for myself have my own hours have uh my own schedule work on what I'm interested in kind of just a very like selfish point of view but it was just a that's just what I want as long as I'm following my own curiosity and sharing that with the world I figured like that's that's how I want to live and I want to be able to spend time with my family um look after my dad that sort of stuff and I figured it's it would be really hard to do that if I was in the US and working uh a super big hour tech company sure the compensation all in comping lifestyle basically working for mean yeah like the sure the compensation the salaries everyone's heard of those but I I kind of learned that the economic sort of um category wasn't as appealing to me as it once was um compared to other things yeah and so obviously you need some baseline level of Economic Security so I wasn't going to just do nothing and just sporadically follow interest without actually turning that into economic value um and so um back to yeah I left I left that job started working for myself and um what I'd learned there is how machine learning gets applied in many different Industries or at least how it attempts to be applied um and so what I was like I was like okay I now have a balance of I've learned machine learning myself and now I've applied it in several different Industries I um again I published an article online of like things I've learned in my first machine learning job and that kind of went semi viral I guess in the tech space on medium and then someone from Canada read it Andre who's my business partner now uh who was teaching web development um on on udemy and his own website he's like we're looking for um machine learning curriculum all of our students looking for machine learning and I'm like okay I've never really taught a course online but I have applied these skills and I have learned them and so I started to to create a course on machine learning of like all the things that I'd actually worked on but I didn't quite learn online so it's very practical HandsOn um so there's no there's really no math in my course it's all just code and like this is the code that you you would write in daytoday as a machine learning engineer and so that turned out to be a way that I could uh make a living by teaching skills I could also follow my curiosity by researching and then putting that um into the courses and then now because of the the flexibility that gives me of I don't have necessarily scheduled hours to make resources I I just make them at will um I can now use time to build nutrify which is and fund like selffund uh a startup with my brother that combines what I'm so it's kind of like a uh a loop of like I learn new things to include in the courses and I also there a fly above my head learn new things to included in the courses and then I use those things to build in a practical application nutrify which anyone with an iPhone can download and use and so then I integrate that back the new stuff in the Practical world into updated materials it's a virtual Circle it's it's like an engine that you built for yourself where like that you've got this kind of like feedback loop that benefits you that's yeah well that's that's it but it's all sort of just stemmed from just having very real conversation with myself how I'd like to how I'd like to live and again there's there's many different ways to I had a physics teacher who had a funny saying who was like there's many different ways to skin a cat and I have no idea where that saying came from but it just comes into my head every time I think about like someone's like what's the what's the right path to learn or what's the right path to to live and I'm like there's there's so many different ways that is just it's just and if you you take advice from me take advice from anyone else it's it's all going to just add to basically sum to zero because some people are will be like um who have the opposite point of view to me is like well you should go work at a big tech company and earn $300,000 a year for five years and do and then after that do XY Z yeah I me that's that's reasonable advice too by the way like that's what I'm saying but if you can do what you did you skipped that you kind of leap frogged over the because you're able to sell fund by creating courses by having a successful YouTube channel and uh you know and you're able to apply your knowledge so that you can sell fund your startup which self funding your startup is a hundred times better than having to like answer to investors all the time and I say that as like well I've talked to so many people that uh prefer it it depends on like you can't have a selffunded satellite company but yeah yeah for some businesses yeah fortunately um our business is yeah we don't have any expenses except for our time oh and database storage which is quite cheap but um yeah we've been rejected a few times from uh from like things like this AI Grant and we've been rejected half a doz there was even a yeah my friend applied for that uh yeah everybody gets rejected like I think pretty much everybody I've had on the podcast has been rejected from black commentator for example well that's what I mean so that's that's what I mean it's like it's the sort of the the nature of um the tech field in general is that it's just it's it's l literally just experimenting nonstop and like most of those experiments won't work and so whether it's like you're beginning to uh learn whatever it is it's just like if you are curious about something it's just like follow that Curiosity but just beware that basically the most of what you do won't necessarily work out so but then what you can you do with that is apply what doesn't work the the quicker you figure out what doesn't work the quicker you figure out what does and so that's one of the reasons uh like I have a saying in my all my courses is experiment experiment experiment is because uh whether it's with learning how to learn whether it's with communic ating with customers or investors or something else like that it's like you're just it's just all one big experiment um and so the more experiments you run the the quicker you figure out what doesn't work the quicker you figure out what does yeah well uh that that is such a profound simple thing like just keep experimenting keep iterating on your ideas don't build the Chariot behind closed doors hopefully none of us are ever in a postapocalyptic situation where it makes sense to skin a cat and eat it I hope we never again that's another one of those things from high school that I'm now remembering that's like I don't condone like maybe he grew up during the Depression or something I I don't know I don't know but it's just a saying he would do he would he would like do sign and cl mathematics and his head on the on the Whiteboard and then like write an algorithm and be like cuz he's a really smart like he's genius physicist and then he'd write like several different things and be like oh we don't have to do that formula we can do this one thousand ways to skin a cat so now it's just like whenever I think of whenever I think of something with multiple paths it's just ingrained to me of like why would someone say that but I don't know it makes sense to me well it's a very literary expression and I want to draw attention to uh for those of you not watching the video who are listening to the podcast which is how I listen I don't actually watch the videos I watch I listen to the podcast you can subscribe to the podcast distributed through the RSS feed the open Airwaves uh of this open protocol real simple syndication uh you can listen in apple podast pod uh Spotify wherever you listen to podcasts but if you're watching on YouTube you will see behind Daniel quite a stocked bookshelf you've got probably like I don't know two or 300 books on there uh yeah I think that's right yeah so you actually read physical books if you're like a technologist I love physical books yeah talk talk about that's my that's my addiction physical books so you just like take a book to the beach or where do you get most of your reading done uh yeah basically anywhere in the in the backyard um I have a little like just wooden table and chairs and I every morning I I usually out there um early morning and just um look at my garden and read some read some pages um coffee shops basically anywhere in bed before um going to sleep physical books like I'll often fall asleep holding a physical book um I just find it yeah very soothing very calming like in this again like my my life is mostly built around screen so I feel like um a physical book is just a it's not trying to sell you anything you've already bought it it's like it's like one of the last places on Earth where there's no ads um so hopefully thats the case yeah exactly right and it's um I just I just love it there's something very satisfying about the tangibility of like flipping through pages and like I guess I don't know completing a chapter or something like that and then like just the smell it's just very nostalgic to me I can't I can't really explain it but it's like it's I just know that I love it and one of the reasons I bring up books I'm not just like doing this to comment on your beautiful bookshelf back there uh you wrote a book and published it a novel if I recall correctly uh about maybe a year year and a half ago uh can you can you talk about that experience and what drove you to write fiction yeah well um so for those who aren't for listening this is my novel it's on the screen called Charlie walks but Daniel Burke it's in the flesh just to say that like to prove that Quincy is not making anything up this is but every word in this is by me uh some some help from uh uh an editor of course to to fix the typos and mistakes but um no I just I basically I like I'm a copycat if I see someone doing something that I find inspiring I want to do that and um so some of my best mentors in life are authors and I've never met I've never met anyone I can't think of any maybe in real life maybe I don't think I've met anyone who's written any of the books on the shelves in real life I mean a lot of them are passed on um but I read them and it's almost like yeah you you have this connection and it's just like that's inspire spiring to me and so a lot of my heroes are authors and so I'm like well I want to do that and I kind of didn't read much at all in high school or even just outside of university cuz I was it was a lot of books that you quote unquote have to read and that's kind of a theme with a lot of my learning is like I forget anything that I had to learn whereas I remember everything that I wanted remember every page of the atlas but nothing of you know high school chemistry class or something like that right exactly you're forced to learn that but but when you're pursuing your own interest it feels so fresh and interesting and like you've discovered this and yeah personal and I started reading yeah fiction novels the first proper fiction novel like obviously uh as a child I think I read a little bit of Harry Potter with with uh my parents and whatnot but then the first fiction novel that really got me into like wow writing can be this was uh post office by Charles macowski which is uh worked in a post office years like that was his fulltime job right that was his fulltime job was working like excuse me um Charles macowski for people who don't know is a a very prominent American German author um but he for the majority of his life just worked dead beat jobs which is what he describes them as um and then he has a bunch of books that are basically just writing about this life and um that he lived and so post office was his first novel and it's basically just a story of how he worked at a post office for 12 years and hated it and uh a lot of people can read Bow's work and be sort of um I guess find it sad or like he had this very grim look on life but I I kind of and this is maybe my rosec colored glasses I kind of looked at it and it was just like you can make artwork out of the mundane that was so inspiring to me I was like this is I didn't want to put the book down I and I'd never really had that feeling with a book and like ever since I was a child when I was reading another um A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket that's like another series that I read as a kid um it Fly going around um and I read this book and I'm like oh my gosh you can just write a story about anything you want and it's amazing and so I'm like I want to do that and then that's where like I started writing like about probably a year or two after I read post office I started I started writing my own novel and um finished it basically through Co um when it was lockdowns and all that sort of stuff and uh yeah wanted to get it go right to the end of not just um not just writing behind closed doors but similar to sort of how I like to publish a lot of what I work on is I wanted to get it um out in the world I wanted to to to have my name basically amongst the the other people on the shelves and just be like that was fun I'm I'm glad I did that that was fun I didn't and if you had told me it's another thing it's like you told me when I was a young that I would be writing a my own book or fiction book I would be like no that's that's stupid but then again things change over time right yeah absolutely and uh I think that's really cool that you pursued that uh that dream of publishing a book and having your book on the Shelf uh a living author among many dead authors on your bookshelf back there uh I'm going to put a link to check out Charlie yeah one day but hopefully you got like another 80 years ahead of you man who knows what kind of medical advancements are going to be brought about by gener yeah that's a good point and of course I'm sure you're taking good care of your nutrition that being your domain of expertise so uh Daniel it's been such a blast having you on man it's been so great talking with you learning more about you because I feel like I couldn't find many good interviews Ken G's Ken's nearest neighbors podcast that was the only podcast interview I could find with you I'm like man this guy has so much to say let's put him in front of people so uh yeah I feel like I say enough on my YouTube channel and blog so I'm like a lot of I'm very glad you asked me an interview cuz I I say I do get requests but I I um yeah I I I definitely do decline a fair few because I kind of yeah I'm I'm a little bit of a Hermit despite what it sounds like yeah man well uh you're very well adjusted hermit well thanks again and hey everybody who's listened this far I just want to thank you for tuning in again I be more like Daniel check like follow your curiosity experiment experiment experiment and check out the show notes for lots of insights and links from Daniel and uh I hope you all have a fantastic fun productive week until next week happy coding
