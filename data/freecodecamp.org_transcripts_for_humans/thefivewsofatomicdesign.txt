With timestamps:

00:00 - hello everyone
00:01 - so this toolkit is the first one of of
00:04 - tonight and i guess all the talks will
00:06 - be about uh atomic design
00:09 - and i will go first and the title is the
00:11 - 5ws of atomic design
00:14 - so let's start this so hello everyone
00:16 - ciao i'm italian so hello ciao means i
00:19 - don't know if you never heard the word
00:20 - maybe never been in a restaurant they've
00:22 - been served by an italian weather or
00:24 - waiters and so you never heard the word
00:25 - that means hello
00:27 - so as i said my name is ricardo and also
00:29 - as already said i'm italian
00:31 - and you know classic hidden styles
00:33 - stereotypes pasta pizza whatever
00:36 - i used to i did like a similar talk like
00:38 - in my previous company as like an
00:40 - internal talk and i also used to have
00:42 - like the emoji of like a football
00:45 - but i removed that because
00:47 - you know
00:48 - you know in the last month there was
00:49 - like some games on tv friendlies i don't
00:52 - care then i happened so
00:54 - yeah
00:55 - so let's move on so that's why i am so
00:58 - what i do so i'm a lead from 10
00:59 - developer at hackney how can a council
01:02 - everyone in this room lives in hackney
01:04 - borough
01:07 - few cool
01:08 - so i just joined actually two weeks ago
01:11 - and it's been like very very good so far
01:13 - it's a quite interesting job and it's
01:15 - quite interesting like uh council what
01:18 - we're doing it's
01:20 - very like unique we are trying to
01:21 - collaborate a lot with other like
01:23 - councils and also with central
01:25 - government
01:26 - and like companies that work with
01:27 - central governments we try to build like
01:30 - digital services that are
01:32 - kind of like user driven so we think
01:34 - about users first more than about
01:35 - technology and other stuff
01:38 - and we are trying to be like very modern
01:41 - in terms of like the tool that we use we
01:42 - have like a manifesto we have like an
01:45 - agile life cycle
01:47 - uh we are using like everything we're
01:49 - moving everything on the cloud on a roku
01:51 - in nws we use like test driven
01:53 - development
01:54 - we do programming it's very very cool
01:57 - and very very modern other councils like
01:59 - they don't try to like do this kind of
02:02 - modern stuff not because they're unable
02:03 - to but just because you know can be
02:05 - expensive and you need to add people and
02:07 - stuff like that and but it's very cool
02:09 - i'm quite quite excited to have joined
02:10 - this company and this is the council and
02:13 - by the way
02:14 - we are hiring like soon more from 10
02:16 - developers so if any of you is looking
02:19 - for a job or you have a job but you want
02:21 - something better and you know
02:23 - after this talk and at the end or like
02:25 - in the pub come and have a chat with me
02:27 - and especially you know minorities
02:29 - underrepresented groups for me
02:30 - something's very important so you know
02:32 - feel free to come and have a chat with
02:34 - me so regarding like that's my role you
02:37 - know only from the developer but like
02:38 - what do i do like i call myself like you
02:41 - know juggling like a css architect and
02:43 - it's not a real like you know role but
02:46 - because it's i love css so much and i
02:49 - care about like writing semantic and
02:51 - accessible html and
02:53 - surprise i'm not actually js developer
02:55 - so i'm in a js meetup but i don't do js
02:57 - i can do js but i never wrote like any
03:00 - react or angular or view
03:03 - and you know you can still be a frontend
03:04 - developer and
03:06 - not be like a js developer and that's
03:08 - why like you know sometimes like i think
03:11 - i prefer to call myself a frontend
03:12 - designer that's something that actually
03:15 - does explain quite well what it is like
03:17 - it's you know it's the person in a way
03:19 - builds like a bridge between like design
03:21 - development and this kind of like
03:24 - role this name was invented by
03:26 - a guy called brett frost who's also like
03:28 - the inventor of atomic design so
03:31 - surprise
03:33 - and also scary moji this is my first
03:36 - ever public talk so
03:38 - you know brace yourself and uh you know
03:41 - thank you and you know if at some point
03:43 - like i panic and run away it's not your
03:45 - fault it's me so thank you in advance
03:47 - and yeah there's a little presentation
03:49 - so let's start and let's talk about
03:51 - atomic design as the title said i will
03:54 - talking about atomic design considering
03:56 - like the
03:57 - 5w of atomic design the 5w is something
04:00 - that usually gets used like in
04:02 - journalism investigation so how to like
04:04 - analyze a topic and stuff like that so
04:07 - the first it's the who so who invented
04:10 - atomic design and as i said was invented
04:13 - by this guy
04:14 - brett frost who also has a lovely dog
04:16 - this dog
04:18 - and so brett frost is a frontend
04:20 - developer he's an american guy and he's
04:23 - a very good developer he's a very nice
04:24 - guy i never met him but i know someone
04:26 - who met him told me he's a nice guy so i
04:28 - guess he's a nice guy
04:30 - and
04:31 - so he came up like few years ago out
04:35 - with this like concept of atomic design
04:38 - and this like methodology about atomic
04:40 - design he even like developed a tool
04:42 - that can be used for
04:44 - using the methodology of atomic design
04:46 - called pattern lab but we're not going
04:48 - to talk about that tonight
04:50 - and
04:52 - yeah also he
04:54 - he wrote a book about about a dummy
04:56 - design that probably you should all read
04:58 - it's uh digital and also it's physical
05:00 - copy if you want a physical copy it
05:02 - comes with a nice figure if you want a
05:03 - physical copy
05:05 - so this is the guy this is dog so the
05:07 - what so what is it is atomic design so
05:11 - we're gonna have like a very simple
05:12 - illustration that can explain everything
05:14 - and it's this one but obviously doesn't
05:17 - make any sense for you probably right
05:19 - now because i have to explain what it is
05:22 - so i will go back to this once i
05:24 - explained a bit more about the what and
05:27 - i'm pretty sure this will be more clear
05:29 - for all of you
05:31 - so let's start from the first one so the
05:33 - atoms
05:35 - so what is an atom so an anatom it's a
05:38 - small and independent component and what
05:41 - i mean with that is that we you know we
05:43 - have a design of a page or a product of
05:45 - an app and we break down the design into
05:48 - components
05:49 - and so what we end up doing is not like
05:52 - we design pages or we design screens we
05:55 - just design
05:56 - and build like components and if we do
05:59 - that instead of like doing pages or
06:02 - other kind of like big monolithic stuff
06:04 - what we do it's like we're able to avoid
06:06 - repetition and confusion
06:08 - and
06:09 - you know what this brings us at the end
06:11 - is just like we can design and build
06:13 - less stuff and quicker because you know
06:15 - it's less confusing it's more clear it's
06:17 - like smaller pieces
06:19 - and
06:20 - you know what you get it this kind of
06:22 - like very nice gif it's not gif gif
06:25 - and you know let's watch this again like
06:27 - you know it's looping so we can have a
06:29 - look
06:30 - what it is so
06:32 - this is like all atoms they combine all
06:34 - together in molecules and then a
06:36 - component like then a template and then
06:39 - a page
06:41 - so let's go back to this one again
06:43 - so we have atoms molecules organism
06:46 - templates and pages so if we go about
06:49 - this
06:50 - again so in atoms for example here we
06:52 - can see like three atoms you know like
06:54 - the label
06:55 - uh like you know the the the the form
06:58 - and the button and then that form all
07:00 - together
07:01 - you know it's a molecule this because
07:04 - it's like an independent component by
07:06 - itself and then it's part with other
07:07 - molecules that can be in this case like
07:08 - the header and then have and there will
07:11 - be
07:11 - like the full like i guess top bar we
07:14 - can call it and then the top bar it's
07:17 - the organism and then we combine
07:20 - organism together and with that we build
07:22 - templates and then once we have
07:24 - templates we can add like real data to
07:27 - those templates and we build pages
07:29 - and if you think about that like it's a
07:31 - quite simple concept in a way it just
07:33 - requires i guess breaking down at the
07:35 - beginning like what you have and
07:37 - thinking about like breaking down in
07:38 - this concept so this is what the what so
07:41 - what we're doing and what is atomic
07:43 - design so let's go next so the why
07:46 - why we're doing this like we know what
07:48 - we have to do and explain like quickly
07:50 - what is atomic design but why we're
07:52 - doing it like what we're gaining with
07:54 - this
07:55 - so we're doing this because we should
07:58 - design and build components and not
08:00 - pages as i said before
08:02 - and
08:02 - the reason why we should do that it's
08:05 - because today and not just today as in
08:07 - 2018 today i guess in the last i don't
08:09 - know 10 years probably on the web like
08:11 - we design and build a lot of
08:15 - everything we designed a build for a lot
08:16 - of devices and we designed the build for
08:18 - a lot of scenarios you know devices your
08:21 - phone
08:22 - your tablet your computer your
08:25 - fridge because fridge they can browse
08:27 - the internet i don't know why your cards
08:29 - if you're rich enough with tesla i don't
08:30 - know good for you
08:32 - and you know different scenarios
08:34 - different websites because we
08:36 - it might be a brand a product a
08:38 - different
08:39 - websites for your different like
08:40 - branding different products different
08:42 - apps because can be you know different
08:43 - devices different os and stuff like that
08:46 - so we have situation like there's all
08:49 - these things that we consider we have
08:50 - these like millions of devices
08:53 - and this picture is very old i'm pretty
08:55 - sure now it's like 10 times more than
08:56 - this as in like the amount of devices
08:58 - that every one of us like use
09:01 - so then we design and build a lot of
09:03 - pages because sometimes pages are
09:05 - different from different devices
09:07 - different use and then
09:09 - we want to avoid like confusion mistakes
09:13 - messy situation like we want to avoid
09:15 - something like
09:16 - this as in like these are buttons from
09:20 - same website and you know this doesn't
09:23 - make any sense like why they're all
09:24 - different there's no like consistency
09:26 - there's no like same color like i don't
09:28 - know padding spacing font like
09:31 - everything is different there's no
09:32 - branding probably they'll code it in a
09:34 - different way so it's very confusing
09:36 - we're like blowing the code you are
09:37 - rewriting things again this is not ideal
09:40 - for sure
09:41 - so
09:42 - then the next the next step is like the
09:45 - where so where we should implement this
09:48 - atomic design methodology and
09:50 - we should apply this methodology in our
09:53 - design as in like you know you have your
09:56 - photoshop illustrator sketch figma i
09:58 - don't know what to use for designing
09:59 - dreamweaver i don't know adobe xd
10:02 - whatever in the browser maybe you're
10:04 - designing the browser you have to apply
10:06 - this methodology as like you know just
10:08 - design small components just like design
10:10 - atoms and then design molecules like
10:13 - don't design pages like design like the
10:15 - small things and when you have all these
10:17 - more components like build pages out of
10:20 - these designs these more components that
10:22 - you have if you know if someone comes to
10:23 - you and asking oh can i see a full page
10:25 - of this design you just like combine all
10:28 - the all these components that you design
10:29 - and you can bend them together and the
10:31 - page is there it's quick and it's better
10:33 - like to kind of like manage and maintain
10:36 - and this goes also like for you know
10:38 - apply this methodology also in your
10:40 - development so when you like developing
10:42 - something like don't build like by hand
10:45 - your index.html page or your index.js
10:48 - page like build all the different
10:50 - components
10:51 - individually and each of them they will
10:53 - have their own style and their like
10:55 - functional id and then combine them
10:57 - together to build like the pages that
10:58 - you need and you know you can do that on
11:00 - the fly i don't know depends about your
11:01 - solution or
11:03 - you can build them like you know just
11:05 - need it but it would be so much easier
11:06 - think about like i don't know lego like
11:08 - you have small bricks and then you build
11:10 - the full thing together so you just have
11:12 - to in a way like build the small bricks
11:13 - first and it's so much easier and
11:16 - it's kind of like
11:18 - i don't know as i said like you avoid a
11:19 - lot of mistakes in the process and it's
11:21 - way more like tiring and tedious and
11:22 - stuff like that so the last of the five
11:26 - w's maybe the last it's the the when so
11:29 - when we should think and kind of like
11:32 - apply this methodology of atomic design
11:35 - and i would say immediately like as soon
11:37 - as possible all the time like
11:39 - thinking atomic design like every time
11:41 - you think that like you should break
11:42 - down things in small pieces and you
11:44 - should always think like oh this small
11:47 - let's say a small atom that would be
11:48 - like a simple button like this thing
11:51 - should be like consistent in throughout
11:53 - your design like if i don't know
11:54 - designer comes to you designers not
11:56 - designing thinking about this concept of
11:57 - dummy design comes to you and shows you
12:00 - like a page with two buttons that do the
12:03 - same thing but they look different then
12:05 - question that say like why this is
12:08 - different like this should be the same
12:09 - atom
12:10 - why this is not the same and if it's
12:12 - different doesn't need to be different
12:14 - is it like a variation of the same
12:16 - button the same atom or not so like try
12:18 - to simplify and unify your pieces of
12:21 - your designs in a very like small bits
12:23 - in atoms and just go there and like from
12:26 - there just like build up
12:28 - so what's next
12:31 - next is actually the last thing this
12:32 - time for real before i was not
12:34 - being honest so it's the how so as i
12:37 - said before you know the 5ws it's what's
12:39 - being used in journalism and
12:40 - investigation sometimes it's the 5ws and
12:43 - the h so the edge is how so we know the
12:46 - who the what the why the when the where
12:48 - but how we
12:50 - implement like this methodology of
12:53 - atomic design
12:54 - and we implemented like building style
12:56 - guides pattern library
12:59 - design systems whatever what you got
13:02 - like i'm pretty sure like the
13:04 - the other folks like they will talk
13:05 - after me they will talk about this like
13:07 - in more details and you know you can use
13:09 - whatever technology you want like
13:11 - building react in view in angular
13:14 - personally i like just to build in
13:16 - simple like html and css and javascript
13:19 - just because in my experience i've been
13:21 - working in companies like agencies but
13:24 - also like private companies where in
13:26 - agency there would be multiple projects
13:28 - and in product companies there will be
13:29 - multiple products they are not using
13:32 - kind of like the same
13:34 - coding like the same like programming
13:37 - languages not using the same frameworks
13:40 - so
13:40 - i find like for me it was easier and
13:43 - kind of like more time-saving to build
13:46 - like kind of like just simple html css
13:48 - and javascript and then with that you
13:49 - can just apply that code in every kind
13:52 - in any kind of like already built
13:54 - like framework or application and stuff
13:56 - like that obviously that's my preference
13:59 - and
14:00 - so that's why i'm talking about just
14:01 - like this generic concept and uh
14:04 - personally
14:06 - if i want to use a tool i use something
14:07 - called fractal it's very similar to
14:10 - pattern lab but lab as i said before was
14:12 - the tool um invented by brett frost
14:14 - fractal is being invented by a guy from
14:16 - clear left he left is a digital agency
14:19 - based in here in uk in brighton
14:21 - and at the moment fractal is not being
14:24 - actually maintained he's on version one
14:27 - by still like very functional and very
14:29 - flexible and i love it it's very simple
14:31 - to use and you can use it whatever you
14:33 - want and again like for me as i said
14:35 - before like just doing like simple html
14:37 - and javascript for me is like the
14:39 - concept of like an mvp i start with the
14:41 - simple stuff and then if after that you
14:43 - want to building react yeah just go on
14:45 - top on that like implement some react
14:47 - after that you want to do something even
14:49 - more cool there's some people
14:50 - experimenting with building like live
14:52 - style guides as in like when you design
14:54 - automatically when you say something
14:55 - scattering figma goes into you like like
14:58 - style guide and
15:00 - that's also amazing but i think that's
15:01 - like the next step and it's up to you
15:04 - one thing that i like is one last thing
15:05 - that i noticed while building like style
15:07 - guides and pattern libraries and
15:08 - implementing the atomic design
15:10 - methodology is like that
15:11 - sometimes you have as i said you know
15:13 - the smallest component is like an atom
15:15 - an atom could be a button could be a
15:17 - label stuff like that could be a header
15:19 - and sometimes you have like something
15:20 - that's
15:21 - below that level is i don't know your
15:23 - fonts your color palette
15:25 - your
15:26 - i don't know your
15:28 - your spacing like the stuff like that so
15:31 - how we should we should have this kind
15:33 - of like bits in our
15:35 - in our components and how do we call
15:38 - them because they're not atoms as in
15:39 - like they don't like your fonts it's not
15:42 - a component that lives in a page
15:44 - so and i call that
15:46 - particles i'm not sure if i invented
15:49 - that probably not but i think it's cool
15:51 - because it's before atoms and it works
15:54 - and
15:55 - you know
15:57 - thank you that's all

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone so this toolkit is the first one of of tonight and i guess all the talks will be about uh atomic design and i will go first and the title is the 5ws of atomic design so let's start this so hello everyone ciao i'm italian so hello ciao means i don't know if you never heard the word maybe never been in a restaurant they've been served by an italian weather or waiters and so you never heard the word that means hello so as i said my name is ricardo and also as already said i'm italian and you know classic hidden styles stereotypes pasta pizza whatever i used to i did like a similar talk like in my previous company as like an internal talk and i also used to have like the emoji of like a football but i removed that because you know you know in the last month there was like some games on tv friendlies i don't care then i happened so yeah so let's move on so that's why i am so what i do so i'm a lead from 10 developer at hackney how can a council everyone in this room lives in hackney borough few cool so i just joined actually two weeks ago and it's been like very very good so far it's a quite interesting job and it's quite interesting like uh council what we're doing it's very like unique we are trying to collaborate a lot with other like councils and also with central government and like companies that work with central governments we try to build like digital services that are kind of like user driven so we think about users first more than about technology and other stuff and we are trying to be like very modern in terms of like the tool that we use we have like a manifesto we have like an agile life cycle uh we are using like everything we're moving everything on the cloud on a roku in nws we use like test driven development we do programming it's very very cool and very very modern other councils like they don't try to like do this kind of modern stuff not because they're unable to but just because you know can be expensive and you need to add people and stuff like that and but it's very cool i'm quite quite excited to have joined this company and this is the council and by the way we are hiring like soon more from 10 developers so if any of you is looking for a job or you have a job but you want something better and you know after this talk and at the end or like in the pub come and have a chat with me and especially you know minorities underrepresented groups for me something's very important so you know feel free to come and have a chat with me so regarding like that's my role you know only from the developer but like what do i do like i call myself like you know juggling like a css architect and it's not a real like you know role but because it's i love css so much and i care about like writing semantic and accessible html and surprise i'm not actually js developer so i'm in a js meetup but i don't do js i can do js but i never wrote like any react or angular or view and you know you can still be a frontend developer and not be like a js developer and that's why like you know sometimes like i think i prefer to call myself a frontend designer that's something that actually does explain quite well what it is like it's you know it's the person in a way builds like a bridge between like design development and this kind of like role this name was invented by a guy called brett frost who's also like the inventor of atomic design so surprise and also scary moji this is my first ever public talk so you know brace yourself and uh you know thank you and you know if at some point like i panic and run away it's not your fault it's me so thank you in advance and yeah there's a little presentation so let's start and let's talk about atomic design as the title said i will talking about atomic design considering like the 5w of atomic design the 5w is something that usually gets used like in journalism investigation so how to like analyze a topic and stuff like that so the first it's the who so who invented atomic design and as i said was invented by this guy brett frost who also has a lovely dog this dog and so brett frost is a frontend developer he's an american guy and he's a very good developer he's a very nice guy i never met him but i know someone who met him told me he's a nice guy so i guess he's a nice guy and so he came up like few years ago out with this like concept of atomic design and this like methodology about atomic design he even like developed a tool that can be used for using the methodology of atomic design called pattern lab but we're not going to talk about that tonight and yeah also he he wrote a book about about a dummy design that probably you should all read it's uh digital and also it's physical copy if you want a physical copy it comes with a nice figure if you want a physical copy so this is the guy this is dog so the what so what is it is atomic design so we're gonna have like a very simple illustration that can explain everything and it's this one but obviously doesn't make any sense for you probably right now because i have to explain what it is so i will go back to this once i explained a bit more about the what and i'm pretty sure this will be more clear for all of you so let's start from the first one so the atoms so what is an atom so an anatom it's a small and independent component and what i mean with that is that we you know we have a design of a page or a product of an app and we break down the design into components and so what we end up doing is not like we design pages or we design screens we just design and build like components and if we do that instead of like doing pages or other kind of like big monolithic stuff what we do it's like we're able to avoid repetition and confusion and you know what this brings us at the end is just like we can design and build less stuff and quicker because you know it's less confusing it's more clear it's like smaller pieces and you know what you get it this kind of like very nice gif it's not gif gif and you know let's watch this again like you know it's looping so we can have a look what it is so this is like all atoms they combine all together in molecules and then a component like then a template and then a page so let's go back to this one again so we have atoms molecules organism templates and pages so if we go about this again so in atoms for example here we can see like three atoms you know like the label uh like you know the the the the form and the button and then that form all together you know it's a molecule this because it's like an independent component by itself and then it's part with other molecules that can be in this case like the header and then have and there will be like the full like i guess top bar we can call it and then the top bar it's the organism and then we combine organism together and with that we build templates and then once we have templates we can add like real data to those templates and we build pages and if you think about that like it's a quite simple concept in a way it just requires i guess breaking down at the beginning like what you have and thinking about like breaking down in this concept so this is what the what so what we're doing and what is atomic design so let's go next so the why why we're doing this like we know what we have to do and explain like quickly what is atomic design but why we're doing it like what we're gaining with this so we're doing this because we should design and build components and not pages as i said before and the reason why we should do that it's because today and not just today as in 2018 today i guess in the last i don't know 10 years probably on the web like we design and build a lot of everything we designed a build for a lot of devices and we designed the build for a lot of scenarios you know devices your phone your tablet your computer your fridge because fridge they can browse the internet i don't know why your cards if you're rich enough with tesla i don't know good for you and you know different scenarios different websites because we it might be a brand a product a different websites for your different like branding different products different apps because can be you know different devices different os and stuff like that so we have situation like there's all these things that we consider we have these like millions of devices and this picture is very old i'm pretty sure now it's like 10 times more than this as in like the amount of devices that every one of us like use so then we design and build a lot of pages because sometimes pages are different from different devices different use and then we want to avoid like confusion mistakes messy situation like we want to avoid something like this as in like these are buttons from same website and you know this doesn't make any sense like why they're all different there's no like consistency there's no like same color like i don't know padding spacing font like everything is different there's no branding probably they'll code it in a different way so it's very confusing we're like blowing the code you are rewriting things again this is not ideal for sure so then the next the next step is like the where so where we should implement this atomic design methodology and we should apply this methodology in our design as in like you know you have your photoshop illustrator sketch figma i don't know what to use for designing dreamweaver i don't know adobe xd whatever in the browser maybe you're designing the browser you have to apply this methodology as like you know just design small components just like design atoms and then design molecules like don't design pages like design like the small things and when you have all these more components like build pages out of these designs these more components that you have if you know if someone comes to you and asking oh can i see a full page of this design you just like combine all the all these components that you design and you can bend them together and the page is there it's quick and it's better like to kind of like manage and maintain and this goes also like for you know apply this methodology also in your development so when you like developing something like don't build like by hand your index.html page or your index.js page like build all the different components individually and each of them they will have their own style and their like functional id and then combine them together to build like the pages that you need and you know you can do that on the fly i don't know depends about your solution or you can build them like you know just need it but it would be so much easier think about like i don't know lego like you have small bricks and then you build the full thing together so you just have to in a way like build the small bricks first and it's so much easier and it's kind of like i don't know as i said like you avoid a lot of mistakes in the process and it's way more like tiring and tedious and stuff like that so the last of the five w's maybe the last it's the the when so when we should think and kind of like apply this methodology of atomic design and i would say immediately like as soon as possible all the time like thinking atomic design like every time you think that like you should break down things in small pieces and you should always think like oh this small let's say a small atom that would be like a simple button like this thing should be like consistent in throughout your design like if i don't know designer comes to you designers not designing thinking about this concept of dummy design comes to you and shows you like a page with two buttons that do the same thing but they look different then question that say like why this is different like this should be the same atom why this is not the same and if it's different doesn't need to be different is it like a variation of the same button the same atom or not so like try to simplify and unify your pieces of your designs in a very like small bits in atoms and just go there and like from there just like build up so what's next next is actually the last thing this time for real before i was not being honest so it's the how so as i said before you know the 5ws it's what's being used in journalism and investigation sometimes it's the 5ws and the h so the edge is how so we know the who the what the why the when the where but how we implement like this methodology of atomic design and we implemented like building style guides pattern library design systems whatever what you got like i'm pretty sure like the the other folks like they will talk after me they will talk about this like in more details and you know you can use whatever technology you want like building react in view in angular personally i like just to build in simple like html and css and javascript just because in my experience i've been working in companies like agencies but also like private companies where in agency there would be multiple projects and in product companies there will be multiple products they are not using kind of like the same coding like the same like programming languages not using the same frameworks so i find like for me it was easier and kind of like more timesaving to build like kind of like just simple html css and javascript and then with that you can just apply that code in every kind in any kind of like already built like framework or application and stuff like that obviously that's my preference and so that's why i'm talking about just like this generic concept and uh personally if i want to use a tool i use something called fractal it's very similar to pattern lab but lab as i said before was the tool um invented by brett frost fractal is being invented by a guy from clear left he left is a digital agency based in here in uk in brighton and at the moment fractal is not being actually maintained he's on version one by still like very functional and very flexible and i love it it's very simple to use and you can use it whatever you want and again like for me as i said before like just doing like simple html and javascript for me is like the concept of like an mvp i start with the simple stuff and then if after that you want to building react yeah just go on top on that like implement some react after that you want to do something even more cool there's some people experimenting with building like live style guides as in like when you design automatically when you say something scattering figma goes into you like like style guide and that's also amazing but i think that's like the next step and it's up to you one thing that i like is one last thing that i noticed while building like style guides and pattern libraries and implementing the atomic design methodology is like that sometimes you have as i said you know the smallest component is like an atom an atom could be a button could be a label stuff like that could be a header and sometimes you have like something that's below that level is i don't know your fonts your color palette your i don't know your your spacing like the stuff like that so how we should we should have this kind of like bits in our in our components and how do we call them because they're not atoms as in like they don't like your fonts it's not a component that lives in a page so and i call that particles i'm not sure if i invented that probably not but i think it's cool because it's before atoms and it works and you know thank you that's all
