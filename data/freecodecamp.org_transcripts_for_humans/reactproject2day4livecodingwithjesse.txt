00:05 - hey everybody is Jessie and today we're
00:10 - gonna switch over to using the newest
00:13 - version of material UI so this will be
00:18 - let's see we started with the the stable
00:22 - version then we switched to the alpha
00:25 - then we switched back to what we
00:28 - originally had and then a few days ago
00:32 - the beta version came out so now we're
00:35 - switching to that so I know we talked
00:38 - about switching yesterday and I didn't
00:43 - realize when we were talking about it
00:45 - that the beta version had already come
00:47 - out so I saw that on Twitter afterwards
00:49 - and I felt really stupid and then a few
00:53 - of you messaged me and told me about it
00:56 - so thanks for giving me the heads up on
00:58 - that I appreciate that let's see alright
01:06 - somebody in the in the live chats asking
01:08 - how do I get started with a series this
01:10 - is only the fourth stream in the series
01:12 - for this particular project so just go
01:17 - back to where it says I think starting
01:21 - my new react project if you want to see
01:25 - like the very beginning of the series
01:27 - you actually have to go to to my channel
01:30 - my personal channel the links in the
01:32 - description and if you if you check I
01:39 - can't remember what the name is I think
01:41 - it's the the first video is like
01:43 - building a website as fast as I can that
01:46 - might be the title so I did a few videos
01:49 - on my own channel before I got invited
01:51 - to livestream for this channel so that's
01:54 - where project one started but project
01:57 - two we're still in the beginning phases
02:00 - of that
02:07 - all right yeah and I am at work today so
02:10 - the video quality should be good
02:13 - sorry again about yesterday's quality
02:20 - I'm I'm in the middle of actually
02:23 - switching over so I'll show you how it's
02:26 - going so this is how it's going so far
02:33 - it's not too bad they were more there
02:36 - were more errors so I've gotten it down
02:39 - I've just been slowly working through
02:41 - error messages because it's definitely
02:44 - different
02:45 - so this switch once I switch it's not
02:49 - going to be that easy to go back so
02:52 - there's differences I guess this will be
02:55 - really good for anyone to watch if
02:57 - you're thinking about switching so let
03:01 - me go through some of the differences
03:02 - that I've noticed so far and I had to
03:04 - change let me bring up the code so I
03:16 - think this this is a good one where I
03:18 - had some differences all right so
03:24 - originally we were bringing in app bar
03:27 - and actually if you check out the code
03:30 - that's in the git repo right now it's
03:32 - the old code I haven't pushed any of the
03:34 - new stuff up yet because there's errors
03:36 - on I never really liked to push errors
03:38 - unless something comes up and I have to
03:41 - leave work and I just I need to push it
03:42 - so as soon as I get rid of the errors
03:45 - I'll push up the new code but for now
03:46 - it'll be alright because you can check
03:49 - on github what we did have and how we
03:52 - had to change it so I did leave some of
03:54 - the code in here seek at least see some
03:56 - of what we had down here and we did
03:59 - change some stuff up here but you have
04:02 - to check that out and github so they
04:06 - make this a bit bigger
04:08 - we had app bar we're bringing in app bar
04:11 - from material UI and all we had to do
04:14 - was put in a title and that's what
04:17 - show up at the top of our our app and
04:21 - you know then we had some other options
04:24 - for like clicking clicking the menu
04:28 - button and that was it it was pretty
04:33 - simple we've replaced this with this
04:37 - button app bar and this is a component
04:39 - that I've made but I basically just
04:42 - copied and pasted everything from the
04:45 - docks for the latest version of material
04:49 - UI so let me show you what I do so in
04:54 - order to get that same thing with I'm
04:56 - still not even sure this will work since
04:58 - I keep getting so many errors but in
05:00 - order to get that same thing it's a lot
05:02 - more complicated so I'm not necessarily
05:04 - saying that's a bad thing it seems like
05:06 - they'll be it'll be easier to customize
05:09 - things like this so I think it will end
05:11 - up being a good thing but for now it's
05:14 - just I'm gonna definitely have to change
05:17 - you know how we were doing things but
05:21 - basically we've got now instead of just
05:24 - a bar we have app bar toolbar typography
05:29 - button icon button menu icon so we're
05:33 - putting all of that together here and
05:36 - you can see some of the stuff is still
05:38 - similar I guess we have this is a little
05:46 - bit odd you know instead of being able
05:48 - to put the title we actually have to put
05:49 - it inside typography so I haven't played
05:53 - with it enough to know whether or not
05:54 - you absolutely have to have this but for
05:58 - now I'm just gonna kind of leave it
06:01 - there once I get it working then we can
06:02 - try to customize it and see what you
06:05 - know what happens there's a little bit
06:08 - so I've noticed for some things I've had
06:12 - to switch to this type of import so
06:15 - before for some of the things I could
06:18 - just import it like this like I'm doing
06:19 - with what say you know app bar toolbar
06:22 - so import app bar from material UI and
06:25 - slash app bar I was getting errors on
06:27 - some of that
06:28 - those and I had to switch it to look
06:32 - like this import and then inside my my
06:34 - curly brackets I'd have to put it listed
06:38 - so I just kind of keep going back and
06:40 - forth to the documentation and trying to
06:42 - figure out what the new way of doing it
06:44 - is so that's what I've been working on
06:49 - so far I had to change okay this is a
06:53 - good example so before I was able to
06:56 - bring in menu item just like this so I
06:59 - would so I would import menu item from
07:03 - material icons or material uimenuitem
07:05 - now I had to switch it and I have to
07:08 - import menu item from material you I'm
07:10 - menu so there's just little things like
07:13 - that that aren't really a big deal but
07:15 - it's a big enough deal to give you an
07:16 - error message so I'm sure it'd only take
07:21 - a few days to get used to how everything
07:23 - is especially since I wasn't really that
07:26 - used to the old way so right now I mean
07:30 - I'm just gonna work try to work through
07:32 - these error messages and let me bring
07:39 - pull that over there and bring this over
07:44 - so our error message that we're getting
07:46 - now and make this bigger Oh actually
07:50 - before we get into anything I do want to
07:52 - say thank you to Patrick and Sebastian
07:55 - for their pool requests so actually a
08:00 - lot of the stuff I just showed you
08:02 - probably seemed weird because those are
08:04 - all new things from pool requests so I'm
08:07 - sorry I totally forgot so a lot changed
08:09 - since yesterday let me take you through
08:12 - some of the changes just so that we're
08:15 - all on the same page so most of the
08:17 - changes are available in github right
08:20 - now so you can check them out as I'm
08:22 - going over them but right now in terms
08:26 - of how everything looks it all looked
08:29 - pretty much the same the changes were
08:32 - just how everything's laid out behind
08:36 - the scenes the only difference that you
08:38 - could see was Sebastian had
08:41 - the different background color to that
08:44 - active class so that it actually did
08:46 - show there was a visual representation
08:49 - of what page you were on when you open
08:51 - that that side drawer so this is what so
08:56 - this side nav component this was all
09:00 - Sebastian so he created the side nav
09:03 - component now of course as I said I've
09:05 - edited it to work with the newer
09:09 - material UI but the bulk of it is still
09:13 - the same
09:14 - I also edited the side nav to add this
09:18 - the sidebar item component so this is a
09:23 - component now so what I had done is so
09:25 - Patrick had submitted a pull request and
09:28 - it was the second pull request then
09:30 - Sebastian submitted pull request three
09:33 - so I think they were both working at the
09:35 - same time so Patrick had worked on some
09:39 - of the same stuff that Sebastian was so
09:42 - I kind of combined the two so I merged
09:45 - and Patrick to pull requests and I
09:48 - turned what he had you know he had
09:50 - basically had this component inside the
09:56 - main app.js file so it was just like
10:02 - okay I mean obviously I don't have it in
10:04 - here but it was just above here you know
10:09 - as a functional component and then he
10:14 - could you know call it you know down
10:17 - here this is all now changed a lot as
10:19 - well but basically I just took that I
10:22 - made it a component so that allowed me
10:26 - to use it this sidebar item inside the
10:33 - nav could side nav component that
10:35 - Sebastian had made so it worked out
10:39 - pretty well I had some trouble getting
10:44 - everything working but that was just
10:45 - entirely due to me messing up the prop
10:48 - names so for a second I thought I had
10:52 - some like really weird bug but it
10:54 - was just just using the wrong prop name
10:57 - so that happens let's see anything else
11:05 - okay on app dodge is a lot did change
11:09 - here as well so you Sebastian change it
11:13 - to use this switch so it's it's a lot
11:17 - more concise and you can see our app
11:24 - component now it's way shorter than it
11:27 - was so the top part where we're
11:29 - importing things actually you know we do
11:32 - have a lot of different things imported
11:35 - now Sebastian took all those can all
11:39 - those views and he imported them all so
11:44 - now they're actually working so you can
11:46 - see each one has like the bare-bones it
11:49 - needs to be a component which is awesome
11:51 - and so now this is all imported and so
11:58 - you can see what our routes will render
12:03 - each one of these views depending on
12:07 - what the URL is Sebastian also added a
12:11 - component in case it's it's some URL
12:15 - that's not here it's just just like a
12:18 - catch-all to tell users like hey that
12:22 - URL doesn't have anything so I think
12:25 - that's also Sebastian Sebastian did a
12:30 - lot of stuff in his pool request he
12:32 - added in the theme properly which I had
12:35 - to take a lot out of things so here's
12:37 - the theme right now because I was
12:39 - getting weird errors with the colors and
12:42 - I realized that I don't actually need to
12:44 - import the colors cuz I was just using
12:46 - the default colors anyway and the only
12:48 - color I had change was primary so I got
12:51 - rid of everything that didn't matter
12:52 - except this primary color that had
12:54 - changed and we can just add back in what
12:57 - we need as we go based on the new
12:59 - documentation and then that'll that'll
13:02 - help us get up and running a little bit
13:04 - faster right now because you know just
13:06 - one less there
13:07 - you less areas that we have to worry
13:09 - about but anyway thank you so much
13:11 - Patrick and Sebastian that helped a lot
13:16 - and made things a lot more clean and it
13:20 - took care of a lot of stuff some of
13:22 - which I had no idea how to do so it
13:24 - would have taken me a long time to
13:26 - figure it out so okay now that we're all
13:30 - caught up and everyone should have a
13:31 - decent idea of where we're at today
13:37 - we're gonna start fixing these errors so
13:42 - we're going to look at cannot Reaper you
13:44 - at bar of undefined in at barge s54 so
13:59 - that's not I don't like this error
14:05 - because at bar isn't even our component
14:12 - right at bar is at bar comes with with
14:19 - the theme so we're gonna have to look at
14:21 - the documentation then and see what the
14:24 - heck's going on with a bar so we have a
14:30 - bar it's just an aesthetic bringing a
14:33 - bar see that this is actually really
14:35 - weird because I copied and pasted this
14:39 - exactly from the documentation and that
14:41 - should be the only place that we're
14:43 - actually using a bar let's double check
14:47 - and make sure we didn't leave it in
14:48 - anywhere so inside I mean other than
14:59 - here which I can get rid of this now
15:07 - other than their I don't think we're
15:09 - using a bar anywhere let me check the
15:12 - live chat quickly I haven't even said hi
15:14 - to everybody yet
15:16 - also this is being broadcast
15:18 - simultaneously on YouTube and on
15:20 - Instagram so if you're watching on
15:22 - Instagram check out the free code camp
15:24 - YouTube channel and you can see the code
15:25 - that I'm working on and if you're
15:27 - watching on YouTube if you would like to
15:29 - see my face and some of my office while
15:32 - I'm doing this you can check me out on
15:34 - Instagram and the link to that is in the
15:37 - description for this video all right so
15:41 - let's see hey everybody
15:57 - Sharan is asking about links to my
16:00 - channel in the description okay it looks
16:06 - like you found it so awesome Joel says
16:16 - hi from Bolivia hey how's it going
16:18 - thanks for watching
16:39 - all right so getting some comments about
16:42 - I guess the new material you I wrote on
16:52 - says looked at Mervyn's here UI and I
16:54 - actually like how it bundle those
16:55 - multiple exports into one where it makes
16:57 - sense but the thing is you wouldn't
16:59 - immediately know without referring to
17:01 - the docs mm-hmm alright cool yes and the
17:08 - the editor is Adam to tell you the truth
17:10 - I'm pretty sure we had a few streams
17:14 - where no one asked about the code editor
17:15 - I was kind of disappointed maybe I'm
17:21 - mistaken maybe I have to go back and
17:23 - watch the streams but I'm pretty sure no
17:25 - one asks maybe yesterday or last week at
17:30 - some point I know there was at least one
17:31 - where I don't think anyone asked so
17:32 - broke the streak
17:58 - and then says hi campers any good
18:02 - resource to learn jQuery real quick
18:05 - I think the free code camp course goes
18:08 - through jQuery at first write the jQuery
18:12 - documentation is actually really easy to
18:14 - read so I would check that out
18:21 - as far as documentation goes some
18:23 - documentation is super difficult to read
18:26 - and but I think the jQuery Doc's are
18:29 - really really easy so I had some similar
18:35 - just joined an Instagram hey how's it
18:37 - going a couple people join in thanks for
18:40 - watching if you want to see the code
18:43 - check it out on free code camp youtube
18:49 - tone asks a fellow include redux I don't
18:53 - think I'm going to include Redux in this
18:55 - project I don't think it'll be needed
18:56 - but I'm there are plans for doing a
19:02 - really really big website in react and
19:05 - if that's the case I'm probably going to
19:07 - use some more advanced things for that
19:10 - so that projects coming so if just a
19:15 - little sneak peek the main website for
19:18 - the university needs redone it's like
19:20 - three years old at this point and the
19:24 - system it's built on is going extinct so
19:27 - we need to redo it and I'm like 90% sure
19:31 - it's gonna be redone with react and
19:34 - there's gonna be cool stuff with load
19:36 - balancing so we're gonna have lots of
19:39 - lots of servers with load balancing
19:42 - going on and lots of caching and things
19:44 - so because it needs to handle a lot of
19:46 - traffic so that's going to be fun to do
19:48 - so all these little react projects are
19:50 - building up to that I'm purposely
19:52 - testing out different things don't eat
19:54 - on that project so that's my plan so
19:57 - that's coming
20:05 - okay Umberto says hey Jessie are you
20:08 - able to comment out the place where you
20:10 - use app bar and see if the error goes
20:12 - away then debug from there I guess I
20:16 - could but really like I'm using app bar
20:20 - here you know and it's wrapping its
20:24 - wrapped there on all this stuff so I'm
20:26 - not sure I can't just comment that out
20:28 - without commenting all this stuff out
20:30 - and then that's basically the whole
20:33 - component what I could I guess like
20:43 - where am I using this set button hat bar
20:48 - I guess I could comment this out really
20:54 - quick and then I have to comment this
20:57 - out too so don't get in err
21:08 - so if you're new to react and you can't
21:11 - figure out how to do comments inside JSX
21:14 - this is how you do it it took me forever
21:17 - to figure this out I used to get errors
21:21 - because I tried to do comments and they
21:22 - wouldn't work so you have to use the
21:24 - curly brackets to drop into JavaScript
21:27 - and then you put your multi-line
21:29 - comments and that's how you have to
21:32 - comment it out it's a little bit more
21:35 - work alright so I'm gonna do that and
21:39 - just see what I get I don't even know
21:45 - where my there we go okay so I actually
21:55 - did get a different error let me show
21:56 - you what I've got going on over here
21:59 - so this is the the app so nav drawer is
22:08 - now undefined
22:33 - yeah and that's actually in this is
22:36 - another area that's that's within this
22:41 - material UI drawer component
22:53 - so I don't know what is going on
23:02 - let me read a few more comments here to
23:04 - see if anyone has any ideas for me hey
23:11 - Jordan Jordan says hi hey Jordan Phillip
23:18 - said Patrick saving Jesse's job one pull
23:20 - request at a time I like that I mean I'm
23:24 - pretty sure I still have a job but I
23:25 - really do appreciate all the pull
23:27 - request it does make me look better that
23:31 - I have these I give you all credit
23:33 - though even like in meetings all uh when
23:35 - we have our our department meetings I do
23:39 - bring up you know that you all have
23:42 - submitted pull requests most of the
23:46 - people in the meeting have no idea what
23:47 - I'm talking about
23:48 - I try to explain it but sometimes it's
23:52 - better just to say I've lots of people
23:53 - helping me
24:15 - XANA says she doesn't have Instagram oh
24:17 - uh I didn't have an Instagram until
24:22 - maybe two months ago and it's kind of
24:29 - fun I never thought it would it would
24:31 - really be I didn't think I'd be into it
24:33 - but it is kind of fun
24:43 - all right Sebastian says remove the
24:46 - prototype Moop remove the prop types oh
24:50 - okay
24:53 - is that what's causing my errors then
25:07 - actually
25:31 - oh really Oh unsaid my Instagram
25:33 - livestream keeps on buffering so I don't
25:36 - really know I I'm really new with
25:40 - everything on Instagram so I'm not I'm
25:42 - not even sure if I can change settings
25:44 - or anything it seems really basic you
25:46 - just hit a button to go live and there's
25:48 - not really any options
25:52 - alright so here's what I do want to say
25:59 - this is it possible is it possible that
26:05 - some stuff from the old version could
26:09 - have been left behind
26:10 - I do remember reading in the in the
26:15 - changelog something about I thought it
26:20 - was something about z-index being
26:22 - removed and that is actually part of
26:25 - what era I was getting
27:02 - all right bill says maybe delete yet
27:05 - then it sounds like a good idea I'm
27:07 - gonna go and I'm gonna delete material
27:11 - UI and then I'm gonna reinstall it and
27:15 - after I delete material UI I will
27:17 - manually check to make sure that it
27:20 - really is deleted so let's go and I mean
27:31 - this is where the shot this is really
27:33 - easy and if it fixes it that'll save a
27:35 - lot of time okay now let's check our
27:42 - node modules so we should have alright
27:51 - so there's no material UI we have the
27:54 - icons there but I'm gonna leave them
27:56 - because I've had no issues with the
27:58 - icons alright now I will
28:13 - I did the at next version and that did
28:16 - give me the the latest beta version is
28:19 - there some other way to do this that
28:21 - would get I mean I assume at this point
28:25 - it'll be fine it'll just give me the
28:27 - latest version so I did double-check in
28:30 - the node module to see what the version
28:32 - number was and I think it's beta v1 and
28:37 - it's like 0 0.2 or something like that
28:47 - Johnny asked if I'm using Ubuntu no not
28:51 - for my machine it's it's Mac I usually
28:53 - blew through all my servers 16 point o4
28:57 - yes uh ones using the Bluetooth so as
29:03 - Anna
29:04 - I'll join you said the console looks
29:07 - like Linux this is actually I term 2 for
29:12 - the console I mean it's all the same
29:14 - commands that you would use in Linux
29:17 - alright well hopefully that make a
29:21 - difference I'm gonna restart the server
29:24 - as well since that seems to help
29:26 - sometimes
29:33 - and I really wanted to start use using
29:38 - and rock like I had mentioned yesterday
29:41 - but is if I'm just getting errors right
29:44 - now there's really no point oh I'll
29:50 - start it if we get these fixed sorry if
29:57 - you're watching on Instagram I my phone
29:59 - just fell over and you're looking at the
30:01 - ceiling so I just noticed that hopefully
30:03 - it wasn't going on for a while let's see
30:11 - all right Sebastian says make sure you
30:13 - updated all the old version components
30:16 - to the beta ones
30:31 - all right let's see natural
30:45 - I'm gonna check out I guess is really
30:48 - not not much I can do except try to
30:55 - check out the docs for everything that
30:59 - I'm getting an error for and where I
31:04 - lost my dog oh hey there alright so I'll
31:11 - bring ease over and I'll leave this air
31:15 - up and so let's check out drawer
31:54 - okay it looks like there is some
31:55 - different stuff for the drawer sorry
32:03 - that was really small I didn't didn't
32:05 - realize that okay I'm gonna move this
32:07 - over to my other screen so I can compare
32:09 - it with the code that we're currently
32:12 - using for the drawer just to see if
32:16 - we're we're doing this the right way so
32:22 - I'm looking at the documentation for the
32:25 - newest version of material UI so I had
32:28 - you have to click the bar if you're
32:29 - gonna go to material - you i.com you
32:32 - have to click the bar at the top that
32:33 - says all ya material UI v1 is coming I
32:37 - like that that's fun so I'm just gonna
32:43 - check to see that I am importing what I
32:47 - need to import
33:03 - and see
33:28 - all right they definitely they have a
33:30 - different way of doing this this handle
33:36 - close I doubt that would be messing us
33:41 - up
33:48 - it's probably worth a shot
34:20 - and now it's saying like instead of
34:23 - saying this state let me bring this over
34:29 - so there's a lot more options going on
34:31 - here so you can open it from all these
34:34 - different places so this state open left
34:40 - then they have different ways to close
34:43 - it so maybe I ought to pull in a lot
34:48 - more what's going on here
34:52 - let me get check back in the live chat
35:08 - Rowen says at this point I would just
35:11 - try modifying other modules by hand and
35:13 - commenting out the offending lines
35:15 - yep sometimes I do things that make
35:17 - people kill themselves
35:22 - one says wouldn't it help to look for
35:24 - more info in the Aires call stack that's
35:29 - close yeah embarrass it says just
35:34 - remember to uncomment your button a part
35:36 - yeah maybe I should just uncomment that
35:38 - for now and then take these one at a
35:42 - time so we'll come back to the drawer
35:44 - thing let's handle this we'll handle
35:49 - them in order I have a feeling that once
35:54 - we figure out one or two of these then
35:56 - the rest won't be as big of a deal
36:01 - oops I forgot to uncomment this there we
36:06 - go okay now let's see what our air was
36:13 - and this one was giving us the air here
36:26 - okay so it is this z-index thing again
36:29 - so for both of the components the air
36:31 - we're getting has to do with this
36:34 - z-index themes the index at bar
36:50 - hmm
36:56 - actually let's check out let's check
37:04 - this out
37:17 - hmm
37:20 - I'm looking looking for things that were
37:25 - really new
37:34 - now as to
37:48 - all right it's worth the shot to just
37:49 - throw this in the Google search and see
38:04 - hello so I didn't really have much hope
38:07 - since this version just came out so let
38:15 - me go back to
38:24 - I wonder we so I did have something I
38:32 - mentioned earlier that I took a lot of
38:33 - stuff out of my theme and I did have
38:36 - some stuff in there I think about the
38:39 - index maybe it was about shadows I hope
38:42 - that that wasn't somehow required and
38:45 - now my themes overriding stuff and it
38:48 - has no there's nothing in there
39:24 - all right let's check out our theme
39:48 - hmm
39:51 - I have
40:34 - yeah let's check what it says about
40:38 - themes then says that seems to be the
40:42 - issue
41:32 - here we go
41:39 - seems he annexed a poor okay so in here
41:44 - in this thing we do have z-index at bar
41:48 - let's check out what we actually have
41:51 - and some triage styles theme jazz
41:54 - alright let's check out our theme JS
41:57 - file
42:29 - all right this looks different let's
42:34 - looks like we have
42:44 - the index touches
42:53 - okay it looks like it's here so so this
42:57 - should be getting imported into the
43:00 - themes well let's just copy this it's
43:08 - copy all of this and let's put it in our
43:12 - custom theme so let's see should be
43:24 - z-index
43:40 - all right not sure if that'll do
43:44 - anything
43:55 - heeey
44:04 - they see where my terminal went I moved
44:08 - it over
44:39 - all right cool hey we fix that error ha
44:43 - ha
44:44 - so hey guess what I have a better idea
44:51 - what if let's just copy everything in
44:55 - this theme Jas since it seems like it's
44:58 - legit and we'll paste it into the theme
45:01 - guess and our node module or better yet
45:05 - let's just paste it into our custom
45:07 - theme so we don't have to mess with our
45:08 - node modules so I mean a little bit
45:18 - repetitive here to have it all in there
45:21 - but instead of going through one by one
45:23 - it's think I think it makes a lot more
45:26 - sense to do it like this let me make
45:30 - sure where this starts okay
45:48 - all right
45:57 - stange it still Evers all right what is
46:04 - it now
46:08 - color theme get palette did did my
46:12 - restarting of the server actually do
46:13 - anything maybe it did
46:28 - okay all right so let's let's look
46:31 - specifically at what's going on here
46:33 - no that's not what we're a par 74 color
46:44 - theme palette you're conscious
46:56 - okay
47:01 - alright let me go back to the to the lab
47:04 - chat for a minute here
47:32 - let's see
47:42 - all right
47:46 - yeah so I'm not good thing everybody was
47:50 - still talking about z-index and I'm not
47:57 - I'm pretty sure that we've we've kind of
48:00 - with I don't want to say we fix the
48:03 - problem because really we just like
48:05 - worked around it but contrast Texas not
48:17 - hmm
48:20 - so the problem with everything is this
48:23 - theme file where's mine
48:33 - so this is really small let me make it
48:35 - bigger okay
49:53 - it really wasn't even a theme is there
50:54 - yeah
50:59 - sebastien s is that the old version
51:00 - theme now I think this these are the
51:03 - dogs now you're right it did switch over
51:05 - I thought I had the it must have
51:08 - switched over when I went to issues so
51:12 - good call on that Sebastian okay now we
51:16 - can actually see this
51:26 - okay palate
51:44 - this good Hallet
51:57 - there we go
51:59 - so I suppose whatever is they're saying
52:04 - it's not a function should be in this
52:06 - palette file all right which one were
52:14 - you looking for get contrast text yep
52:18 - this is it all right so for some reason
52:25 - it can't find that
52:32 - Why Why cannot find that let's see if we
52:39 - have a pallet J s file in our high
52:46 - modulus under Styles polishes
52:59 - get contrast text okay so we have it all
53:04 - right so we we obviously have the right
53:09 - function here
53:34 - okay it is bringing in pallet
53:43 - okay so I don't maybe I'm missing
53:47 - something I'm gonna go to a live chat
53:48 - and see but it seems to me like we just
53:50 - saw that this theme Dodge is is pulling
53:53 - in pilots which is requiring pallet and
54:02 - then when we looked in pallet we did
54:06 - have the correct function all right so
54:13 - let me scroll up a bit
54:25 - Frances asks can we fork your project
54:29 - and fix it for you yeah you can I don't
54:32 - really want to push things with errors
54:35 - up to github but I I might I might push
54:39 - this actually it won't let me my commit
54:41 - hook will probably not let me push this
54:43 - up
55:21 - all right let's see
55:29 - huh Joe honey says the next video should
55:32 - be named problem-solving with Jesse yeah
55:34 - honestly sometimes that's that's what
55:36 - happens so hey with someone else joined
55:39 - us in on the Instagram livestream so
55:44 - welcome if you want to check out the
55:46 - code that I'm working on go to free code
55:49 - camps YouTube channel and then you get
55:56 - to see what I'm seeing on my screen
56:15 - alright John Hanson said the Instagram
56:17 - live feed is great as it's not delayed
56:20 - sound to the YouTube live video cool
56:22 - alright that's cool
56:23 - I mean I'll I never realized that it was
56:25 - pretty cool
56:34 - Patrick says you're using the old theme
56:38 - way with the new beta way check out the
56:40 - docs for themes okay cool I will do that
56:46 - so let me see I think I have the docs up
56:52 - here still I thought I did did I move
56:57 - him yeah yeah I did I moved him to the
57:04 - other screen so I could see better so
57:12 - let's do the provider
57:26 - so it's full and so here's where I'm
57:30 - here's my FPS thing obviously I copied
57:35 - over pretty much everything let's see
58:08 - all right so maybe I am I'm thinking so
58:13 - I did update and where we get an app j/s
58:18 - I updated to thought I updated to the
58:23 - new way of pulling in a theme so we
58:26 - changed before this was different
58:29 - and so I updated that and also how we
58:40 - pull in the theme as well
59:11 - all right so maybe I'll pull this over
59:13 - so y'all can see what I'm looking at
59:14 - here so this is under the new
59:16 - documentation at the bottom of the
59:18 - themes page so maybe creating the theme
59:25 - is different as well
59:27 - so
59:44 - maybe I need to do something like this
59:52 - alright so let's try
60:06 - gets us to change the URL too
60:43 - oops
60:47 - put down the wrong spot with the
60:56 - Fierstein
61:10 - does that look right that does not look
61:12 - right let me see
61:37 - okay definitely get an air
61:59 - maybe I'm looking at the wrong
63:48 - John Henson in the live chat says great
63:51 - news I installed react on top of web
63:54 - hack pain in the works now using router
63:58 - as well for multiple pages links not
64:00 - trying to see if I can get sass to build
64:02 - separate files for each page that's
64:04 - awesome definitely let me know how sass
64:08 - works out for you
64:18 - synthetic today how did I put that in
64:21 - the wrong place probably I did
65:05 - yeah
65:13 - I'm still getting that air yeah John
65:19 - said the Instagram feed did die yeah so
65:21 - I guess Instagram has a limit of an hour
65:24 - on live streams so only the first hour
65:26 - of anything I do gets good streams
65:30 - imagine my stream was probably super
65:34 - boring for Instagram because it was a
65:37 - lot of me just looking at a screen I
65:39 - wasn't doing much talking so alright so
65:57 - I'm not sure
66:11 - I'm not exactly sure where to get an X
66:13 - from here no you think for a minute uh
66:18 - uh so I mean we had we made some
66:21 - progress and then we're stops
66:34 - okay let's see if we have a pallet
67:19 - what was where is our our github
67:25 - documentation for pallet
67:48 - I can't do this can i this isn't gonna
67:51 - work
67:52 - is there any way for me to put a
67:53 - function inside this object this I feel
67:58 - like this is like just objects 101 but
68:20 - we have figured I can't do that what if
68:29 - I get contrast ratio I hope I do like
68:34 - this
69:26 - okay
70:36 - okay so faster exists JavaScript has
70:40 - first-class functions of course you can
70:43 - put a function and an object or not like
70:45 - that just because you can doesn't mean
70:46 - the material UI knows how to use it yeah
70:58 - at this point I was just continuing on
71:01 - with our process of putting everything
71:05 - that we get an arrow and into our into
71:08 - our theme but it looks like this pulls a
71:10 - lot of other stuff so it's probably not
71:13 - a great idea because well we will
71:15 - literally end up having to put
71:16 - everything into there when the problems
71:25 - seems to be for some reason
71:37 - things aren't getting pulled into themed
71:40 - ijs properly
72:12 - actually hold on this this looks weird
72:18 - maybe I'm missing something I might be
72:24 - missing something one on in here but
72:27 - look in here it's saying palette is
72:30 - palette right but up here we're naming
72:38 - it underscore palette where else are we
72:40 - are we getting are we changing that
72:45 - somewhere okay here we go
72:53 - looks like we're defining palette here
73:22 - Rohan says I think it's the wrong way to
73:25 - go having to put everything in a custom
73:27 - theme file yeah I agree I think it was
73:30 - worth a shot if I could just get it to
73:31 - work with just the part that I put in
73:33 - but if I have to put in more than it's
73:35 - not it's going to be too much
73:54 - Tylar s in the lodge at what's your
73:57 - opinion on these new nano degree
73:58 - programs popping up and I'm going to
74:00 - answer that just to take a little break
74:02 - from this I'm I'm doing the react
74:07 - nanodegree program from Udacity right
74:10 - now in terms of the course quality and
74:14 - content I'm impressed with it so far
74:16 - I don't know firsthand whether a nano
74:20 - degree is helpful or getting a job
74:23 - excuse me he's yawning
74:27 - today is day two with no caffeine I
74:30 - think I'm gonna take a little break from
74:32 - it and see if it helps me sleep but I am
74:35 - you own anymore
74:36 - so anyway I don't know personally
74:39 - whether it helps getting a job of course
74:41 - you like I've read online that you know
74:44 - companies are starting to recognize them
74:48 - but I don't really know you know how
74:50 - many companies and so I'm not I'm not
74:54 - really sure if your main goal when
74:57 - taking a nano degree is to learn and you
75:00 - want to get feedback to do like the paid
75:02 - version and you know get a you know
75:08 - actually end up with a nano degree then
75:09 - I think it's good for that I just I kind
75:14 - of wonder like what people think when
75:16 - they see nano degree on a resume does
75:19 - that really mean anything or not I think
75:21 - at some point it might mean something
75:23 - into some companies it might mean
75:25 - something but I'm just not sure yet but
75:27 - I think it's you definitely learn a lot
75:38 - all right okay Patrick I see your your
75:42 - comment here you can't
75:43 - are you using create Mui theme which is
75:46 - how the dogs did let's see
76:06 - yeah so here's what I'm going up here
76:21 - Rowen says are we importing Mui theme
76:24 - provider yes I am importing that as well
76:29 - yeah that's the thing some stuff was
76:32 - working and even before I changed all
76:35 - this around which I couldn't even keep
76:37 - track of what I was doing I think I I
76:39 - think I've messed this up I should
76:42 - probably just undo everything since it
76:46 - was working but this was you know it
76:52 - fixed that z-index issue that we were
76:55 - having so obviously this was getting
76:58 - used somehow but I actually do think I
77:04 - should just undo all of the stuff I did
77:08 - in here I don't know they did it is
77:17 - fixing the z-index issue still right let
77:22 - me let me take out this stuff I did down
77:25 - here
77:47 - we got accidentally set a debug point
77:50 - didn't realize it okay yeah so that that
77:58 - that actually is taking care of that
78:00 - z-index issue it's going farther down in
78:04 - at bar Jaso the z-index thing was up
78:07 - here in line 54 now we've we've made it
78:10 - all the way down the line 74 and now is
78:12 - this pilot thing
78:59 - let me see I see I'm barrister I see
79:06 - what you're saying shouldn't that be
79:07 - from interior UI styles and UI theme
79:10 - provider let me see where I was having
79:12 - that I think I pulled this I think I
79:22 - pulled this right from the docks let me
79:24 - double-check
79:40 - yeah Patrick said I feel like this beta
79:43 - is an alpha yeah kind of regretting
79:48 - regretting the decision to do this the
79:51 - good thing is let me check my git log
79:55 - and see what I've actually done I don't
80:01 - know that I've actually committed any of
80:03 - this so we could just go back easily
80:11 - yeah so if this endeavor fails it won't
80:20 - be hard to go back to where we were at
80:22 - that's that's the beauty of get in
80:29 - version control in general so if you
80:32 - aren't using it this is a great reason
80:36 - to use git is if you if you mess up your
80:42 - app just pretty much beyond repair which
80:45 - is it's kind of what I think I've done
80:48 - just now
80:56 - then then it can help you can just go
80:59 - back mmm same thing
81:09 - oh actually we've got okay so I had gone
81:18 - in here and mess with some stuff
81:31 - actually okay so this makes at least
81:35 - this will help us narrow down so it's
81:37 - it's able successfully at least it was
81:40 - able to go into a theme palette
81:44 - background at bar but then when it tried
81:48 - to theme palette get contrast text it
81:53 - couldn't work so it it actually is
81:55 - importing so the issue then would
81:58 - probably be within palette dot Jas
82:39 - okay so this is where it is actually
82:42 - returning get contrast text
82:56 - and that is yeah that is the name of the
82:59 - function
83:28 - okay I said now I'm seeing what you all
83:31 - were saying about pushing into another
83:32 - granite branch first okay let's see
83:57 - so is that is there like a shortcut way
84:00 - for me to switch to another branch and
84:02 - commit these or do I need to commit them
84:04 - to master and then push to another
84:06 - branch and then just roll back the
84:08 - commits
84:51 - okay david says there is a shortcut way
84:56 - if anybody commits directly to branch
85:12 - alright let me check so like commit
85:18 - directly to to the UH to another branch
85:25 - okay cool it comes up as one of the
85:29 - options in the Google search
86:06 - all right making new parents check it
86:08 - out and the change will come with you
86:10 - and you changed and I had the chance to
86:11 - see wrench commit
86:19 - okay I had no idea that you could do
86:22 - this
86:34 - alright let me pull over I'm gonna do
86:37 - this so everybody can see it
86:41 - okay so this everybody knows what I'm
86:44 - doing I am on the master branch and I
86:47 - don't want to commit these changes to
86:49 - master branch
86:49 - I've decided according to the advice of
86:54 - you all that I should commit these on a
86:57 - different branch and then push it up to
86:58 - github and then that way everyone can
87:00 - see what's going on so that's what I'm
87:02 - attempting to do so I'm gonna get
87:05 - checkout Hey and then we're gonna say
87:20 - material you are beta
87:27 - okay cool
87:36 - awesome everything's right here grades
88:15 - I can't believe that made it through I
88:19 - thought for sure I had done something
88:21 - that was gonna cause an error that's
88:23 - awesome alright oops
88:42 - cool all right now it's on github cuo
88:46 - can see the mess that I've made
89:02 - yeah that's why I get
89:10 - all right
90:24 - okay so this should be working because
90:27 - it's undone everything but for some
90:33 - reason it's not
91:25 - there we go sir I didn't I didn't
91:29 - install the right packages so that's
91:32 - that was the problem
91:54 - all right so at least now I can show you
92:00 - show you this the the highlighting of
92:06 - the page you are on is working so I
92:11 - think this is what's yeah
92:32 - I think what I'll do for now maybe is
92:42 - give up on the idea of using the newest
92:47 - version so the whole point of me wanting
92:50 - to use the beta version instead of the
92:53 - normal one is for the coulomb class
92:56 - components and I figured that that would
93:00 - save me time in the long run by having
93:04 - all those extra components and it would
93:06 - be worth the set-up time and
93:08 - transferring it over I think now that
93:13 - that does that's not true anymore so the
93:17 - time I thought it would take to get this
93:19 - working was way less than what it's
93:22 - actually taking and then that's no
93:24 - longer a good decision time was I think
93:27 - it would be faster for me to just make
93:30 - my own column classes and use them I
93:36 - mean I could potentially even try to
93:39 - model them after what's in the beta if I
93:41 - want to but that's just too much also
93:47 - I'm a little worried that if I run into
93:51 - errors since it's so new there's not
93:55 - going to be a whole lot of other people
93:57 - talking about those errors all right one
94:04 - has to go see later one thanks for for
94:07 - joining us what Sun isn't that okay it's
94:10 - about 3:30 so yeah I think now's a good
94:14 - time for me to admit defeat for today
94:18 - and wrap things up so all in all today
94:23 - did did get a lot of stuff done behind
94:26 - the scenes in terms of getting the pull
94:29 - requests in and making some extra
94:32 - components and things so it wasn't you
94:37 - know in terms of trying to do the switch
94:39 - to the beta that that definitely was a
94:41 - failure but did I did get some stuff
94:45 - done on
94:46 - the site and can always come back since
94:48 - we've you know save those changes in
94:50 - another branch it's entirely possible to
94:52 - come back to that at some point but for
94:57 - right now I'm not sure that's the best
94:59 - idea so this is gonna be a very good
95:03 - lesson to me and maybe to someone else
95:05 - out there that it's probably better just
95:08 - to pick something and stick with it and
95:11 - not try to keep changing it because I've
95:14 - definitely wasted a lot of time I don't
95:17 - want to say wasted I mean learned some
95:19 - stuff along the way but it could have
95:22 - been using that time to actually build
95:23 - this out so don't like to I don't ever
95:30 - really like to back down from trying to
95:32 - figure something out but at some point
95:35 - there's just not enough time to figure
95:38 - some things out
95:46 - bill wrote react project to day ten
95:49 - design decided for real this time that
95:54 - actually does sound like something I
95:55 - would type if you've ever seen my commit
95:57 - messages if I try to commit something
96:01 - and I accidentally don't commit what I
96:03 - wanted to my next commit message is
96:06 - always do this thing for real this time
96:09 - so it is how I would say it okay so I'm
96:15 - gonna go back through the chat now and
96:17 - see if there's any questions that I
96:18 - missed I'm sure there probably is
96:20 - because I was so focused on this so if
96:27 - you have any questions put them in the
96:32 - live chat now if you can't stick around
96:34 - for the chat it Patricks if you can't
96:40 - stick around for the chat just direct
96:42 - message me on twitter or put it in the
96:45 - comments to this video and I'll get to
96:47 - him whenever I get a chance
96:49 - Patrick said dude commit amend yeah I
96:54 - actually did do an amend on a project I
96:58 - was working on my lunch break so I have
97:00 - done that before but usually honestly
97:04 - usually I don't even care enough to do
97:06 - an amend because it's just me working on
97:10 - these projects so um although now you
97:13 - all are working on them with me but like
97:15 - in the past it's always been just me
97:18 - working on these projects and no one
97:19 - ever looked at my gig commits so I got
97:23 - was lazy about it and I said I'll just
97:26 - do another commit it would be faster so
97:29 - I probably should start using amend more
97:34 - but
97:37 - all right so let me go through the chat
97:39 - here and if you got to leave now thank
97:46 - you so much for watching I'll be back
97:48 - tomorrow all right
98:15 - looking through right actually not
98:17 - really a lot of questions so far in the
98:20 - chat oh I see you all have made some
98:26 - comments on JSX
98:28 - comment tags being ugly I agree I mean
98:33 - it's not really that big of a deal I
98:34 - guess but I do wish there were a simpler
98:37 - way in a nicer looking way to do
98:40 - comments
99:14 - so Jan asks can you recommend me a good
99:18 - tool for debugging j/s that was that's a
99:25 - long time ago so I'm not sure if you're
99:26 - still around but I mean dev dev tools is
99:32 - pretty good chrome dev tools is good
99:35 - does anyone know of anything better than
99:37 - then chrome dev tools that's easy to use
99:41 - I mean I assume you're talking I guess
99:45 - about you know regular JavaScript I'm
99:49 - not sure how good dev tools is a
99:52 - debugging like node or I don't know if
99:55 - you're trying to do something with react
99:57 - native or something like that
99:59 - I'm sure maybe there's different
100:01 - debuggers for that but if just talk
100:02 - about like normal JavaScript that most
100:05 - people write
100:06 - I think dev tools is pretty good I
100:11 - haven't really used much of anything
100:13 - else though so maybe there's other
100:15 - things out there and not aware of
100:49 - nam says hi everyone I'm a new person
100:53 - I've gotten into programmer I like
100:56 - working on back-end or to be software
100:59 - engineer in general someone here could
101:01 - you suggest the programming language you
101:05 - like most I think this is not going to
101:11 - be a surprise to anyone I'm gonna say
101:13 - JavaScript so yeah it did
101:22 - I guess if your question is simply what
101:24 - do you like the most then I would say
101:26 - JavaScript although I did enjoy Python
101:31 - when I did some stuff in Python just
101:33 - because of like all the indentation and
101:36 - stuff it was really easy to do and you
101:39 - could actually program with Python on a
101:41 - phone it was easy with the phone
101:43 - keyboard normally programming on a phone
101:47 - keyboard is ridiculous because you know
101:50 - all the brackets and everything that you
101:52 - need take forever to get to someone
101:55 - should make an app that's a phone
101:57 - keyboard for programmers and you could
102:00 - have custom keyboards depending on the
102:02 - language that you're using that would be
102:05 - awesome I would like that app I mean I
102:06 - don't really plan on programming that
102:09 - much on my phone if ever but if they're
102:12 - a really good keyboard that made it easy
102:14 - I would definitely like that because I'm
102:18 - sure there's some keys that you could
102:20 - just do without because you don't use it
102:22 - that often and you could replace it with
102:25 - brackets something that you use for
102:29 - anyway or maybe an app that's like an
102:34 - editor a mobile editor so not only does
102:37 - it have the keyboard but it also has all
102:39 - the features that you would have been
102:41 - like a code editor the autocomplete and
102:44 - things like that
102:49 - anyway if anybody wants to work on that
102:53 - project if you open it up and make a
102:56 - repo on github all I'll try to
102:58 - contribute to it
103:32 - okay Noam says thanks for the suggestion
103:38 - not thanking me this was earlier
103:41 - thanking Rohan for the suggestion of
103:43 - Rowan actually suggesting Python as well
103:45 - this is actually most people using
103:47 - Python tend to machine learning or data
103:49 - science my favorite is creating apps
103:52 - actually so nam if you're interested in
103:54 - creating apps you could try to go with
103:57 - one of like the native app languages so
104:00 - for iOS I think it's it's Swift right
104:03 - and then for Android it's Java but now
104:07 - you can use Kotlin which I don't know
104:09 - anything about Kotlin but I'm pretty
104:11 - sure you can use it to make apps on
104:13 - Android so if you wanted something else
104:19 - to make apps with you could make apps
104:21 - with JavaScript using react native so I
104:26 - guess it depends on which what you want
104:29 - to do the good thing about doing it with
104:32 - JavaScript is that it would let you more
104:35 - easily make apps for iOS and Android if
104:40 - you just focus on on one or the other
104:43 - then it would probably be a little bit
104:45 - harder to switch that's my assumption I
104:47 - don't really know cuz I haven't done it
104:48 - but anyway that would be my advice
104:54 - either JavaScript with react native or
105:00 - one of the native languages for iOS or
105:03 - Android
105:27 - well I didn't see this so I I definitely
105:33 - didn't see this so sorry if you're doing
105:34 - here but it's free code camp said how
105:36 - much longer you'll be streaming so I'm
105:37 - assuming that was someone else logged in
105:40 - as free code camp while I'm streaming he
105:42 - said that I didn't even know you you
105:44 - could do that but if you're still
105:48 - watching I want to wrap this up by 4
105:52 - o'clock
106:09 - all right so I'm gonna skip through it
106:12 - looks like there's a lot of discussion
106:14 - about helping Blake with his I guess
106:20 - there's portfolio project so I'm gonna
106:22 - skip through a bunch of that how I bill
106:29 - said drinking some G fuel thanks Jesse
106:31 - for bringing this into my life cool I'm
106:33 - glad she liked the G fuel so ahead I had
106:38 - mentioned before that I I drink e fuel
106:41 - and so bill had asked me about it and I
106:44 - directed him to the the chief fuel site
106:46 - so yeah I liked it and I guess bill
106:50 - likes it so I need to get like some
106:53 - affiliate programs set up so I can get I
106:56 - can get you all a discount if you use my
106:59 - code or something like that I think I
107:03 - need a lot more people watching me
107:04 - before I would they would want me to be
107:07 - an affiliate
107:32 - okay almost to the bottom of the live
107:34 - chat
107:57 - Jordan has any good videos on git and
108:01 - Sarah said Udacity has some good visit
108:03 - yeah actually I really like the Udacity
108:06 - course on git
108:10 - that was really good I I'm pretty sure
108:14 - learn Codecademy that that's the YouTube
108:18 - channel learn code Academy has some
108:20 - videos on git
108:24 - there's videos on get on for free code
108:27 - camp so on this channel
108:31 - yeah so between those you can get a
108:33 - pretty good idea about how to use git
108:48 - okay in regard to the JavaScript
108:51 - debugging question from a few minutes
108:52 - ago jordan says Firebug works as well
108:57 - and David says Visual Studio code has
109:00 - built-in JavaScript debugging that can
109:02 - be used in the editor which is nice so
109:04 - that's cool I didn't didn't realize that
109:07 - so those are some other options John
109:12 - Hanson has a question is it better to
109:14 - jslint for es6 and JSX in the build or
109:19 - in the atom editor it's probably you
109:23 - could probably do both if you if you
109:25 - want to know was better probably
109:26 - probably both and then that way having
109:31 - it done in the build or on commit would
109:34 - enforce it for other people working on
109:36 - the project but then you would have
109:39 - immediate feedback of how it's supposed
109:41 - to look in your browser or in your
109:43 - editor if you had the editor plugin so I
109:48 - would say if you're only gonna do one I
109:50 - think doing it on on commit or on build
109:53 - is the best if you can only have one but
109:56 - if you can have both and that would be
109:58 - better
110:06 - services that Firefox development
110:08 - browser is pretty good
110:19 - now it looks like David gave Jordan
110:22 - pretty much the same answer in terms of
110:24 - both that are better to have in terms of
110:30 - linting es6 and Rohan said it as well so
110:36 - I sit a read down farther
110:59 - I'm good John said thanks for the answer
111:02 - you're welcome
111:02 - I have Sebastian asked if I fixed the
111:06 - issue with the theme no that definitely
111:13 - didn't fix it so there's a there is a
111:17 - branch now on github that has the mess
111:20 - that I made on it so if anybody really
111:22 - wants to check it out you can but
111:24 - otherwise I think I'm just gonna leave
111:26 - it alone for now and just continue
111:30 - developing with what we had before that
111:32 - actually works on the master branch so
111:35 - all right well I've gotten through
111:37 - everything in the live chat if I miss
111:39 - your question just send it to me on
111:40 - Twitter put it in the comments below
111:42 - thanks so much everyone for all the help
111:45 - really sorry I didn't we didn't actually
111:48 - accomplish anything so it's a lot better
111:51 - I think when we get something
111:52 - accomplished because like we can feel
111:55 - good about that but we did work through
111:58 - a lot of stuff even though it didn't end
112:00 - you know finally and you know us solving
112:03 - the big issues but anyway it was cool we
112:06 - got to dig into a lot of a lot a lot of
112:11 - the node modules and you know a lot of
112:14 - the code base for material UI the beta
112:18 - version so that was kind of cool to see
112:19 - how it all work so maybe it was useful a
112:21 - bit and got to do some stuff with get
112:24 - that I'd never done before so not bad
112:28 - and it was good hanging out with all of
112:31 - you and talking with all the years so I
112:33 - will be back tomorrow should be at the
112:35 - normal time 2 p.m. Eastern time and have
112:41 - a great day I'll see y'all tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody is Jessie and today we're gonna switch over to using the newest version of material UI so this will be let's see we started with the the stable version then we switched to the alpha then we switched back to what we originally had and then a few days ago the beta version came out so now we're switching to that so I know we talked about switching yesterday and I didn't realize when we were talking about it that the beta version had already come out so I saw that on Twitter afterwards and I felt really stupid and then a few of you messaged me and told me about it so thanks for giving me the heads up on that I appreciate that let's see alright somebody in the in the live chats asking how do I get started with a series this is only the fourth stream in the series for this particular project so just go back to where it says I think starting my new react project if you want to see like the very beginning of the series you actually have to go to to my channel my personal channel the links in the description and if you if you check I can't remember what the name is I think it's the the first video is like building a website as fast as I can that might be the title so I did a few videos on my own channel before I got invited to livestream for this channel so that's where project one started but project two we're still in the beginning phases of that all right yeah and I am at work today so the video quality should be good sorry again about yesterday's quality I'm I'm in the middle of actually switching over so I'll show you how it's going so this is how it's going so far it's not too bad they were more there were more errors so I've gotten it down I've just been slowly working through error messages because it's definitely different so this switch once I switch it's not going to be that easy to go back so there's differences I guess this will be really good for anyone to watch if you're thinking about switching so let me go through some of the differences that I've noticed so far and I had to change let me bring up the code so I think this this is a good one where I had some differences all right so originally we were bringing in app bar and actually if you check out the code that's in the git repo right now it's the old code I haven't pushed any of the new stuff up yet because there's errors on I never really liked to push errors unless something comes up and I have to leave work and I just I need to push it so as soon as I get rid of the errors I'll push up the new code but for now it'll be alright because you can check on github what we did have and how we had to change it so I did leave some of the code in here seek at least see some of what we had down here and we did change some stuff up here but you have to check that out and github so they make this a bit bigger we had app bar we're bringing in app bar from material UI and all we had to do was put in a title and that's what show up at the top of our our app and you know then we had some other options for like clicking clicking the menu button and that was it it was pretty simple we've replaced this with this button app bar and this is a component that I've made but I basically just copied and pasted everything from the docks for the latest version of material UI so let me show you what I do so in order to get that same thing with I'm still not even sure this will work since I keep getting so many errors but in order to get that same thing it's a lot more complicated so I'm not necessarily saying that's a bad thing it seems like they'll be it'll be easier to customize things like this so I think it will end up being a good thing but for now it's just I'm gonna definitely have to change you know how we were doing things but basically we've got now instead of just a bar we have app bar toolbar typography button icon button menu icon so we're putting all of that together here and you can see some of the stuff is still similar I guess we have this is a little bit odd you know instead of being able to put the title we actually have to put it inside typography so I haven't played with it enough to know whether or not you absolutely have to have this but for now I'm just gonna kind of leave it there once I get it working then we can try to customize it and see what you know what happens there's a little bit so I've noticed for some things I've had to switch to this type of import so before for some of the things I could just import it like this like I'm doing with what say you know app bar toolbar so import app bar from material UI and slash app bar I was getting errors on some of that those and I had to switch it to look like this import and then inside my my curly brackets I'd have to put it listed so I just kind of keep going back and forth to the documentation and trying to figure out what the new way of doing it is so that's what I've been working on so far I had to change okay this is a good example so before I was able to bring in menu item just like this so I would so I would import menu item from material icons or material uimenuitem now I had to switch it and I have to import menu item from material you I'm menu so there's just little things like that that aren't really a big deal but it's a big enough deal to give you an error message so I'm sure it'd only take a few days to get used to how everything is especially since I wasn't really that used to the old way so right now I mean I'm just gonna work try to work through these error messages and let me bring pull that over there and bring this over so our error message that we're getting now and make this bigger Oh actually before we get into anything I do want to say thank you to Patrick and Sebastian for their pool requests so actually a lot of the stuff I just showed you probably seemed weird because those are all new things from pool requests so I'm sorry I totally forgot so a lot changed since yesterday let me take you through some of the changes just so that we're all on the same page so most of the changes are available in github right now so you can check them out as I'm going over them but right now in terms of how everything looks it all looked pretty much the same the changes were just how everything's laid out behind the scenes the only difference that you could see was Sebastian had the different background color to that active class so that it actually did show there was a visual representation of what page you were on when you open that that side drawer so this is what so this side nav component this was all Sebastian so he created the side nav component now of course as I said I've edited it to work with the newer material UI but the bulk of it is still the same I also edited the side nav to add this the sidebar item component so this is a component now so what I had done is so Patrick had submitted a pull request and it was the second pull request then Sebastian submitted pull request three so I think they were both working at the same time so Patrick had worked on some of the same stuff that Sebastian was so I kind of combined the two so I merged and Patrick to pull requests and I turned what he had you know he had basically had this component inside the main app.js file so it was just like okay I mean obviously I don't have it in here but it was just above here you know as a functional component and then he could you know call it you know down here this is all now changed a lot as well but basically I just took that I made it a component so that allowed me to use it this sidebar item inside the nav could side nav component that Sebastian had made so it worked out pretty well I had some trouble getting everything working but that was just entirely due to me messing up the prop names so for a second I thought I had some like really weird bug but it was just just using the wrong prop name so that happens let's see anything else okay on app dodge is a lot did change here as well so you Sebastian change it to use this switch so it's it's a lot more concise and you can see our app component now it's way shorter than it was so the top part where we're importing things actually you know we do have a lot of different things imported now Sebastian took all those can all those views and he imported them all so now they're actually working so you can see each one has like the barebones it needs to be a component which is awesome and so now this is all imported and so you can see what our routes will render each one of these views depending on what the URL is Sebastian also added a component in case it's it's some URL that's not here it's just just like a catchall to tell users like hey that URL doesn't have anything so I think that's also Sebastian Sebastian did a lot of stuff in his pool request he added in the theme properly which I had to take a lot out of things so here's the theme right now because I was getting weird errors with the colors and I realized that I don't actually need to import the colors cuz I was just using the default colors anyway and the only color I had change was primary so I got rid of everything that didn't matter except this primary color that had changed and we can just add back in what we need as we go based on the new documentation and then that'll that'll help us get up and running a little bit faster right now because you know just one less there you less areas that we have to worry about but anyway thank you so much Patrick and Sebastian that helped a lot and made things a lot more clean and it took care of a lot of stuff some of which I had no idea how to do so it would have taken me a long time to figure it out so okay now that we're all caught up and everyone should have a decent idea of where we're at today we're gonna start fixing these errors so we're going to look at cannot Reaper you at bar of undefined in at barge s54 so that's not I don't like this error because at bar isn't even our component right at bar is at bar comes with with the theme so we're gonna have to look at the documentation then and see what the heck's going on with a bar so we have a bar it's just an aesthetic bringing a bar see that this is actually really weird because I copied and pasted this exactly from the documentation and that should be the only place that we're actually using a bar let's double check and make sure we didn't leave it in anywhere so inside I mean other than here which I can get rid of this now other than their I don't think we're using a bar anywhere let me check the live chat quickly I haven't even said hi to everybody yet also this is being broadcast simultaneously on YouTube and on Instagram so if you're watching on Instagram check out the free code camp YouTube channel and you can see the code that I'm working on and if you're watching on YouTube if you would like to see my face and some of my office while I'm doing this you can check me out on Instagram and the link to that is in the description for this video all right so let's see hey everybody Sharan is asking about links to my channel in the description okay it looks like you found it so awesome Joel says hi from Bolivia hey how's it going thanks for watching all right so getting some comments about I guess the new material you I wrote on says looked at Mervyn's here UI and I actually like how it bundle those multiple exports into one where it makes sense but the thing is you wouldn't immediately know without referring to the docs mmhmm alright cool yes and the the editor is Adam to tell you the truth I'm pretty sure we had a few streams where no one asked about the code editor I was kind of disappointed maybe I'm mistaken maybe I have to go back and watch the streams but I'm pretty sure no one asks maybe yesterday or last week at some point I know there was at least one where I don't think anyone asked so broke the streak and then says hi campers any good resource to learn jQuery real quick I think the free code camp course goes through jQuery at first write the jQuery documentation is actually really easy to read so I would check that out as far as documentation goes some documentation is super difficult to read and but I think the jQuery Doc's are really really easy so I had some similar just joined an Instagram hey how's it going a couple people join in thanks for watching if you want to see the code check it out on free code camp youtube tone asks a fellow include redux I don't think I'm going to include Redux in this project I don't think it'll be needed but I'm there are plans for doing a really really big website in react and if that's the case I'm probably going to use some more advanced things for that so that projects coming so if just a little sneak peek the main website for the university needs redone it's like three years old at this point and the system it's built on is going extinct so we need to redo it and I'm like 90% sure it's gonna be redone with react and there's gonna be cool stuff with load balancing so we're gonna have lots of lots of servers with load balancing going on and lots of caching and things so because it needs to handle a lot of traffic so that's going to be fun to do so all these little react projects are building up to that I'm purposely testing out different things don't eat on that project so that's my plan so that's coming okay Umberto says hey Jessie are you able to comment out the place where you use app bar and see if the error goes away then debug from there I guess I could but really like I'm using app bar here you know and it's wrapping its wrapped there on all this stuff so I'm not sure I can't just comment that out without commenting all this stuff out and then that's basically the whole component what I could I guess like where am I using this set button hat bar I guess I could comment this out really quick and then I have to comment this out too so don't get in err so if you're new to react and you can't figure out how to do comments inside JSX this is how you do it it took me forever to figure this out I used to get errors because I tried to do comments and they wouldn't work so you have to use the curly brackets to drop into JavaScript and then you put your multiline comments and that's how you have to comment it out it's a little bit more work alright so I'm gonna do that and just see what I get I don't even know where my there we go okay so I actually did get a different error let me show you what I've got going on over here so this is the the app so nav drawer is now undefined yeah and that's actually in this is another area that's that's within this material UI drawer component so I don't know what is going on let me read a few more comments here to see if anyone has any ideas for me hey Jordan Jordan says hi hey Jordan Phillip said Patrick saving Jesse's job one pull request at a time I like that I mean I'm pretty sure I still have a job but I really do appreciate all the pull request it does make me look better that I have these I give you all credit though even like in meetings all uh when we have our our department meetings I do bring up you know that you all have submitted pull requests most of the people in the meeting have no idea what I'm talking about I try to explain it but sometimes it's better just to say I've lots of people helping me XANA says she doesn't have Instagram oh uh I didn't have an Instagram until maybe two months ago and it's kind of fun I never thought it would it would really be I didn't think I'd be into it but it is kind of fun all right Sebastian says remove the prototype Moop remove the prop types oh okay is that what's causing my errors then actually oh really Oh unsaid my Instagram livestream keeps on buffering so I don't really know I I'm really new with everything on Instagram so I'm not I'm not even sure if I can change settings or anything it seems really basic you just hit a button to go live and there's not really any options alright so here's what I do want to say this is it possible is it possible that some stuff from the old version could have been left behind I do remember reading in the in the changelog something about I thought it was something about zindex being removed and that is actually part of what era I was getting all right bill says maybe delete yet then it sounds like a good idea I'm gonna go and I'm gonna delete material UI and then I'm gonna reinstall it and after I delete material UI I will manually check to make sure that it really is deleted so let's go and I mean this is where the shot this is really easy and if it fixes it that'll save a lot of time okay now let's check our node modules so we should have alright so there's no material UI we have the icons there but I'm gonna leave them because I've had no issues with the icons alright now I will I did the at next version and that did give me the the latest beta version is there some other way to do this that would get I mean I assume at this point it'll be fine it'll just give me the latest version so I did doublecheck in the node module to see what the version number was and I think it's beta v1 and it's like 0 0.2 or something like that Johnny asked if I'm using Ubuntu no not for my machine it's it's Mac I usually blew through all my servers 16 point o4 yes uh ones using the Bluetooth so as Anna I'll join you said the console looks like Linux this is actually I term 2 for the console I mean it's all the same commands that you would use in Linux alright well hopefully that make a difference I'm gonna restart the server as well since that seems to help sometimes and I really wanted to start use using and rock like I had mentioned yesterday but is if I'm just getting errors right now there's really no point oh I'll start it if we get these fixed sorry if you're watching on Instagram I my phone just fell over and you're looking at the ceiling so I just noticed that hopefully it wasn't going on for a while let's see all right Sebastian says make sure you updated all the old version components to the beta ones all right let's see natural I'm gonna check out I guess is really not not much I can do except try to check out the docs for everything that I'm getting an error for and where I lost my dog oh hey there alright so I'll bring ease over and I'll leave this air up and so let's check out drawer okay it looks like there is some different stuff for the drawer sorry that was really small I didn't didn't realize that okay I'm gonna move this over to my other screen so I can compare it with the code that we're currently using for the drawer just to see if we're we're doing this the right way so I'm looking at the documentation for the newest version of material UI so I had you have to click the bar if you're gonna go to material you i.com you have to click the bar at the top that says all ya material UI v1 is coming I like that that's fun so I'm just gonna check to see that I am importing what I need to import and see all right they definitely they have a different way of doing this this handle close I doubt that would be messing us up it's probably worth a shot and now it's saying like instead of saying this state let me bring this over so there's a lot more options going on here so you can open it from all these different places so this state open left then they have different ways to close it so maybe I ought to pull in a lot more what's going on here let me get check back in the live chat Rowen says at this point I would just try modifying other modules by hand and commenting out the offending lines yep sometimes I do things that make people kill themselves one says wouldn't it help to look for more info in the Aires call stack that's close yeah embarrass it says just remember to uncomment your button a part yeah maybe I should just uncomment that for now and then take these one at a time so we'll come back to the drawer thing let's handle this we'll handle them in order I have a feeling that once we figure out one or two of these then the rest won't be as big of a deal oops I forgot to uncomment this there we go okay now let's see what our air was and this one was giving us the air here okay so it is this zindex thing again so for both of the components the air we're getting has to do with this zindex themes the index at bar hmm actually let's check out let's check this out hmm I'm looking looking for things that were really new now as to all right it's worth the shot to just throw this in the Google search and see hello so I didn't really have much hope since this version just came out so let me go back to I wonder we so I did have something I mentioned earlier that I took a lot of stuff out of my theme and I did have some stuff in there I think about the index maybe it was about shadows I hope that that wasn't somehow required and now my themes overriding stuff and it has no there's nothing in there all right let's check out our theme hmm I have yeah let's check what it says about themes then says that seems to be the issue here we go seems he annexed a poor okay so in here in this thing we do have zindex at bar let's check out what we actually have and some triage styles theme jazz alright let's check out our theme JS file all right this looks different let's looks like we have the index touches okay it looks like it's here so so this should be getting imported into the themes well let's just copy this it's copy all of this and let's put it in our custom theme so let's see should be zindex all right not sure if that'll do anything heeey they see where my terminal went I moved it over all right cool hey we fix that error ha ha so hey guess what I have a better idea what if let's just copy everything in this theme Jas since it seems like it's legit and we'll paste it into the theme guess and our node module or better yet let's just paste it into our custom theme so we don't have to mess with our node modules so I mean a little bit repetitive here to have it all in there but instead of going through one by one it's think I think it makes a lot more sense to do it like this let me make sure where this starts okay all right stange it still Evers all right what is it now color theme get palette did did my restarting of the server actually do anything maybe it did okay all right so let's let's look specifically at what's going on here no that's not what we're a par 74 color theme palette you're conscious okay alright let me go back to the to the lab chat for a minute here let's see all right yeah so I'm not good thing everybody was still talking about zindex and I'm not I'm pretty sure that we've we've kind of with I don't want to say we fix the problem because really we just like worked around it but contrast Texas not hmm so the problem with everything is this theme file where's mine so this is really small let me make it bigger okay it really wasn't even a theme is there yeah sebastien s is that the old version theme now I think this these are the dogs now you're right it did switch over I thought I had the it must have switched over when I went to issues so good call on that Sebastian okay now we can actually see this okay palate this good Hallet there we go so I suppose whatever is they're saying it's not a function should be in this palette file all right which one were you looking for get contrast text yep this is it all right so for some reason it can't find that Why Why cannot find that let's see if we have a pallet J s file in our high modulus under Styles polishes get contrast text okay so we have it all right so we we obviously have the right function here okay it is bringing in pallet okay so I don't maybe I'm missing something I'm gonna go to a live chat and see but it seems to me like we just saw that this theme Dodge is is pulling in pilots which is requiring pallet and then when we looked in pallet we did have the correct function all right so let me scroll up a bit Frances asks can we fork your project and fix it for you yeah you can I don't really want to push things with errors up to github but I I might I might push this actually it won't let me my commit hook will probably not let me push this up all right let's see huh Joe honey says the next video should be named problemsolving with Jesse yeah honestly sometimes that's that's what happens so hey with someone else joined us in on the Instagram livestream so welcome if you want to check out the code that I'm working on go to free code camps YouTube channel and then you get to see what I'm seeing on my screen alright John Hanson said the Instagram live feed is great as it's not delayed sound to the YouTube live video cool alright that's cool I mean I'll I never realized that it was pretty cool Patrick says you're using the old theme way with the new beta way check out the docs for themes okay cool I will do that so let me see I think I have the docs up here still I thought I did did I move him yeah yeah I did I moved him to the other screen so I could see better so let's do the provider so it's full and so here's where I'm here's my FPS thing obviously I copied over pretty much everything let's see all right so maybe I am I'm thinking so I did update and where we get an app j/s I updated to thought I updated to the new way of pulling in a theme so we changed before this was different and so I updated that and also how we pull in the theme as well all right so maybe I'll pull this over so y'all can see what I'm looking at here so this is under the new documentation at the bottom of the themes page so maybe creating the theme is different as well so maybe I need to do something like this alright so let's try gets us to change the URL too oops put down the wrong spot with the Fierstein does that look right that does not look right let me see okay definitely get an air maybe I'm looking at the wrong John Henson in the live chat says great news I installed react on top of web hack pain in the works now using router as well for multiple pages links not trying to see if I can get sass to build separate files for each page that's awesome definitely let me know how sass works out for you synthetic today how did I put that in the wrong place probably I did yeah I'm still getting that air yeah John said the Instagram feed did die yeah so I guess Instagram has a limit of an hour on live streams so only the first hour of anything I do gets good streams imagine my stream was probably super boring for Instagram because it was a lot of me just looking at a screen I wasn't doing much talking so alright so I'm not sure I'm not exactly sure where to get an X from here no you think for a minute uh uh so I mean we had we made some progress and then we're stops okay let's see if we have a pallet what was where is our our github documentation for pallet I can't do this can i this isn't gonna work is there any way for me to put a function inside this object this I feel like this is like just objects 101 but we have figured I can't do that what if I get contrast ratio I hope I do like this okay okay so faster exists JavaScript has firstclass functions of course you can put a function and an object or not like that just because you can doesn't mean the material UI knows how to use it yeah at this point I was just continuing on with our process of putting everything that we get an arrow and into our into our theme but it looks like this pulls a lot of other stuff so it's probably not a great idea because well we will literally end up having to put everything into there when the problems seems to be for some reason things aren't getting pulled into themed ijs properly actually hold on this this looks weird maybe I'm missing something I might be missing something one on in here but look in here it's saying palette is palette right but up here we're naming it underscore palette where else are we are we getting are we changing that somewhere okay here we go looks like we're defining palette here Rohan says I think it's the wrong way to go having to put everything in a custom theme file yeah I agree I think it was worth a shot if I could just get it to work with just the part that I put in but if I have to put in more than it's not it's going to be too much Tylar s in the lodge at what's your opinion on these new nano degree programs popping up and I'm going to answer that just to take a little break from this I'm I'm doing the react nanodegree program from Udacity right now in terms of the course quality and content I'm impressed with it so far I don't know firsthand whether a nano degree is helpful or getting a job excuse me he's yawning today is day two with no caffeine I think I'm gonna take a little break from it and see if it helps me sleep but I am you own anymore so anyway I don't know personally whether it helps getting a job of course you like I've read online that you know companies are starting to recognize them but I don't really know you know how many companies and so I'm not I'm not really sure if your main goal when taking a nano degree is to learn and you want to get feedback to do like the paid version and you know get a you know actually end up with a nano degree then I think it's good for that I just I kind of wonder like what people think when they see nano degree on a resume does that really mean anything or not I think at some point it might mean something into some companies it might mean something but I'm just not sure yet but I think it's you definitely learn a lot all right okay Patrick I see your your comment here you can't are you using create Mui theme which is how the dogs did let's see yeah so here's what I'm going up here Rowen says are we importing Mui theme provider yes I am importing that as well yeah that's the thing some stuff was working and even before I changed all this around which I couldn't even keep track of what I was doing I think I I think I've messed this up I should probably just undo everything since it was working but this was you know it fixed that zindex issue that we were having so obviously this was getting used somehow but I actually do think I should just undo all of the stuff I did in here I don't know they did it is fixing the zindex issue still right let me let me take out this stuff I did down here we got accidentally set a debug point didn't realize it okay yeah so that that that actually is taking care of that zindex issue it's going farther down in at bar Jaso the zindex thing was up here in line 54 now we've we've made it all the way down the line 74 and now is this pilot thing let me see I see I'm barrister I see what you're saying shouldn't that be from interior UI styles and UI theme provider let me see where I was having that I think I pulled this I think I pulled this right from the docks let me doublecheck yeah Patrick said I feel like this beta is an alpha yeah kind of regretting regretting the decision to do this the good thing is let me check my git log and see what I've actually done I don't know that I've actually committed any of this so we could just go back easily yeah so if this endeavor fails it won't be hard to go back to where we were at that's that's the beauty of get in version control in general so if you aren't using it this is a great reason to use git is if you if you mess up your app just pretty much beyond repair which is it's kind of what I think I've done just now then then it can help you can just go back mmm same thing oh actually we've got okay so I had gone in here and mess with some stuff actually okay so this makes at least this will help us narrow down so it's it's able successfully at least it was able to go into a theme palette background at bar but then when it tried to theme palette get contrast text it couldn't work so it it actually is importing so the issue then would probably be within palette dot Jas okay so this is where it is actually returning get contrast text and that is yeah that is the name of the function okay I said now I'm seeing what you all were saying about pushing into another granite branch first okay let's see so is that is there like a shortcut way for me to switch to another branch and commit these or do I need to commit them to master and then push to another branch and then just roll back the commits okay david says there is a shortcut way if anybody commits directly to branch alright let me check so like commit directly to to the UH to another branch okay cool it comes up as one of the options in the Google search all right making new parents check it out and the change will come with you and you changed and I had the chance to see wrench commit okay I had no idea that you could do this alright let me pull over I'm gonna do this so everybody can see it okay so this everybody knows what I'm doing I am on the master branch and I don't want to commit these changes to master branch I've decided according to the advice of you all that I should commit these on a different branch and then push it up to github and then that way everyone can see what's going on so that's what I'm attempting to do so I'm gonna get checkout Hey and then we're gonna say material you are beta okay cool awesome everything's right here grades I can't believe that made it through I thought for sure I had done something that was gonna cause an error that's awesome alright oops cool all right now it's on github cuo can see the mess that I've made yeah that's why I get all right okay so this should be working because it's undone everything but for some reason it's not there we go sir I didn't I didn't install the right packages so that's that was the problem all right so at least now I can show you show you this the the highlighting of the page you are on is working so I think this is what's yeah I think what I'll do for now maybe is give up on the idea of using the newest version so the whole point of me wanting to use the beta version instead of the normal one is for the coulomb class components and I figured that that would save me time in the long run by having all those extra components and it would be worth the setup time and transferring it over I think now that that does that's not true anymore so the time I thought it would take to get this working was way less than what it's actually taking and then that's no longer a good decision time was I think it would be faster for me to just make my own column classes and use them I mean I could potentially even try to model them after what's in the beta if I want to but that's just too much also I'm a little worried that if I run into errors since it's so new there's not going to be a whole lot of other people talking about those errors all right one has to go see later one thanks for for joining us what Sun isn't that okay it's about 330 so yeah I think now's a good time for me to admit defeat for today and wrap things up so all in all today did did get a lot of stuff done behind the scenes in terms of getting the pull requests in and making some extra components and things so it wasn't you know in terms of trying to do the switch to the beta that that definitely was a failure but did I did get some stuff done on the site and can always come back since we've you know save those changes in another branch it's entirely possible to come back to that at some point but for right now I'm not sure that's the best idea so this is gonna be a very good lesson to me and maybe to someone else out there that it's probably better just to pick something and stick with it and not try to keep changing it because I've definitely wasted a lot of time I don't want to say wasted I mean learned some stuff along the way but it could have been using that time to actually build this out so don't like to I don't ever really like to back down from trying to figure something out but at some point there's just not enough time to figure some things out bill wrote react project to day ten design decided for real this time that actually does sound like something I would type if you've ever seen my commit messages if I try to commit something and I accidentally don't commit what I wanted to my next commit message is always do this thing for real this time so it is how I would say it okay so I'm gonna go back through the chat now and see if there's any questions that I missed I'm sure there probably is because I was so focused on this so if you have any questions put them in the live chat now if you can't stick around for the chat it Patricks if you can't stick around for the chat just direct message me on twitter or put it in the comments to this video and I'll get to him whenever I get a chance Patrick said dude commit amend yeah I actually did do an amend on a project I was working on my lunch break so I have done that before but usually honestly usually I don't even care enough to do an amend because it's just me working on these projects so um although now you all are working on them with me but like in the past it's always been just me working on these projects and no one ever looked at my gig commits so I got was lazy about it and I said I'll just do another commit it would be faster so I probably should start using amend more but all right so let me go through the chat here and if you got to leave now thank you so much for watching I'll be back tomorrow all right looking through right actually not really a lot of questions so far in the chat oh I see you all have made some comments on JSX comment tags being ugly I agree I mean it's not really that big of a deal I guess but I do wish there were a simpler way in a nicer looking way to do comments so Jan asks can you recommend me a good tool for debugging j/s that was that's a long time ago so I'm not sure if you're still around but I mean dev dev tools is pretty good chrome dev tools is good does anyone know of anything better than then chrome dev tools that's easy to use I mean I assume you're talking I guess about you know regular JavaScript I'm not sure how good dev tools is a debugging like node or I don't know if you're trying to do something with react native or something like that I'm sure maybe there's different debuggers for that but if just talk about like normal JavaScript that most people write I think dev tools is pretty good I haven't really used much of anything else though so maybe there's other things out there and not aware of nam says hi everyone I'm a new person I've gotten into programmer I like working on backend or to be software engineer in general someone here could you suggest the programming language you like most I think this is not going to be a surprise to anyone I'm gonna say JavaScript so yeah it did I guess if your question is simply what do you like the most then I would say JavaScript although I did enjoy Python when I did some stuff in Python just because of like all the indentation and stuff it was really easy to do and you could actually program with Python on a phone it was easy with the phone keyboard normally programming on a phone keyboard is ridiculous because you know all the brackets and everything that you need take forever to get to someone should make an app that's a phone keyboard for programmers and you could have custom keyboards depending on the language that you're using that would be awesome I would like that app I mean I don't really plan on programming that much on my phone if ever but if they're a really good keyboard that made it easy I would definitely like that because I'm sure there's some keys that you could just do without because you don't use it that often and you could replace it with brackets something that you use for anyway or maybe an app that's like an editor a mobile editor so not only does it have the keyboard but it also has all the features that you would have been like a code editor the autocomplete and things like that anyway if anybody wants to work on that project if you open it up and make a repo on github all I'll try to contribute to it okay Noam says thanks for the suggestion not thanking me this was earlier thanking Rohan for the suggestion of Rowan actually suggesting Python as well this is actually most people using Python tend to machine learning or data science my favorite is creating apps actually so nam if you're interested in creating apps you could try to go with one of like the native app languages so for iOS I think it's it's Swift right and then for Android it's Java but now you can use Kotlin which I don't know anything about Kotlin but I'm pretty sure you can use it to make apps on Android so if you wanted something else to make apps with you could make apps with JavaScript using react native so I guess it depends on which what you want to do the good thing about doing it with JavaScript is that it would let you more easily make apps for iOS and Android if you just focus on on one or the other then it would probably be a little bit harder to switch that's my assumption I don't really know cuz I haven't done it but anyway that would be my advice either JavaScript with react native or one of the native languages for iOS or Android well I didn't see this so I I definitely didn't see this so sorry if you're doing here but it's free code camp said how much longer you'll be streaming so I'm assuming that was someone else logged in as free code camp while I'm streaming he said that I didn't even know you you could do that but if you're still watching I want to wrap this up by 4 o'clock all right so I'm gonna skip through it looks like there's a lot of discussion about helping Blake with his I guess there's portfolio project so I'm gonna skip through a bunch of that how I bill said drinking some G fuel thanks Jesse for bringing this into my life cool I'm glad she liked the G fuel so ahead I had mentioned before that I I drink e fuel and so bill had asked me about it and I directed him to the the chief fuel site so yeah I liked it and I guess bill likes it so I need to get like some affiliate programs set up so I can get I can get you all a discount if you use my code or something like that I think I need a lot more people watching me before I would they would want me to be an affiliate okay almost to the bottom of the live chat Jordan has any good videos on git and Sarah said Udacity has some good visit yeah actually I really like the Udacity course on git that was really good I I'm pretty sure learn Codecademy that that's the YouTube channel learn code Academy has some videos on git there's videos on get on for free code camp so on this channel yeah so between those you can get a pretty good idea about how to use git okay in regard to the JavaScript debugging question from a few minutes ago jordan says Firebug works as well and David says Visual Studio code has builtin JavaScript debugging that can be used in the editor which is nice so that's cool I didn't didn't realize that so those are some other options John Hanson has a question is it better to jslint for es6 and JSX in the build or in the atom editor it's probably you could probably do both if you if you want to know was better probably probably both and then that way having it done in the build or on commit would enforce it for other people working on the project but then you would have immediate feedback of how it's supposed to look in your browser or in your editor if you had the editor plugin so I would say if you're only gonna do one I think doing it on on commit or on build is the best if you can only have one but if you can have both and that would be better services that Firefox development browser is pretty good now it looks like David gave Jordan pretty much the same answer in terms of both that are better to have in terms of linting es6 and Rohan said it as well so I sit a read down farther I'm good John said thanks for the answer you're welcome I have Sebastian asked if I fixed the issue with the theme no that definitely didn't fix it so there's a there is a branch now on github that has the mess that I made on it so if anybody really wants to check it out you can but otherwise I think I'm just gonna leave it alone for now and just continue developing with what we had before that actually works on the master branch so all right well I've gotten through everything in the live chat if I miss your question just send it to me on Twitter put it in the comments below thanks so much everyone for all the help really sorry I didn't we didn't actually accomplish anything so it's a lot better I think when we get something accomplished because like we can feel good about that but we did work through a lot of stuff even though it didn't end you know finally and you know us solving the big issues but anyway it was cool we got to dig into a lot of a lot a lot of the node modules and you know a lot of the code base for material UI the beta version so that was kind of cool to see how it all work so maybe it was useful a bit and got to do some stuff with get that I'd never done before so not bad and it was good hanging out with all of you and talking with all the years so I will be back tomorrow should be at the normal time 2 p.m. Eastern time and have a great day I'll see y'all tomorrow
