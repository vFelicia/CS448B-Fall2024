00:06 - hey everybody its Jessie and today we're
00:10 - gonna do some more beginner friendly
00:13 - stuff I guess so we're gonna work on
00:15 - styling so mainly be dealing with CSS
00:20 - with sass and possibly some of we'll be
00:26 - looking at the material UI documentation
00:29 - and trying to work with some of the
00:32 - options that already come with the
00:33 - components I'd rather work with the
00:35 - options than try to override it but we
00:37 - may have to just you know try to
00:39 - override some stuff with our own CSS if
00:43 - we have to do that that's okay too
00:46 - I want to catch catch everyone up to
00:49 - what I've been working on I guess the
00:57 - end of yesterday and for this morning so
01:03 - you can check out my Trello board and
01:05 - see kind of what's moved around there's
01:07 - a link in the description but mainly I
01:12 - have set up a server so I have a droplet
01:17 - on digitalocean I talked about going
01:21 - through the set up in a stream but I
01:25 - decided well for one I already did the
01:29 - exact same set up for a last project and
01:33 - I stream that so anybody who really
01:35 - wants to see that can go back to the
01:38 - last thing I stream the the other reason
01:44 - is simply because a lot of it is just
01:47 - following documentation and copy and
01:49 - pasting commands and that's much easier
01:52 - to do without making mistakes if I can
01:55 - focus and not have to worry about
01:57 - talking when I'm doing it and I was able
01:59 - to get though everything set up and in
02:04 - probably 40 minutes or less so it went
02:09 - it went really quickly
02:12 - you know I was able to focus so it's all
02:15 - set up it has its running ubuntu 16.04
02:20 - nginx is the reverse proxy node and it's
02:25 - set up with a SSL and I pointed that
02:30 - obviously I pointed a domain name to it
02:32 - and set up the SSL and so that's already
02:37 - the last step is simply to just bring in
02:40 - the repository I'm just going to use git
02:43 - for that so right before the stream
02:45 - started I was just trying to set up the
02:47 - SSH keys in my github account so that I
02:51 - could just bring the bring the
02:54 - repository right in so the flow of
02:56 - updating will be I push from my local
02:59 - machine to github and then I pull from
03:03 - github into the server and then rebuild
03:07 - everything and the updates will be live
03:10 - at that point all right so let me say
03:17 - hate everybody in the lab chat get a few
03:19 - few you in there
03:21 - Alex asks is there a playlist for these
03:24 - videos yes there is a playlist and it's
03:28 - called I don't know this code let me
03:33 - check I think it's like maybe Jesse
03:40 - builds a react app live something like
03:43 - that I can if some if somebody knows put
03:50 - in the live set otherwise I'm gonna look
03:52 - it up on my other screen I add videos
03:56 - every day to this playlist you think I'd
03:58 - remember what the name of it is alright
04:05 - flail is okay the playlist is called
04:09 - Jesse builds a react project live that's
04:11 - the playlist for just this project
04:13 - project too if you want to see all the
04:16 - videos including project one the
04:17 - playlist is just live coding with Jesse
04:20 - at some point I should probably split
04:22 - them out into two different playlists
04:24 - but for now that
04:26 - how they're divided up so we are on day
04:31 - 29 no one day 30 so there are 29 videos
04:36 - currently in the playlist this is number
04:37 - 30 we will be finishing this project up
04:42 - pretty soon assuming there's not a lot
04:45 - of changes whenever this gets reviewed
04:50 - ok so quickly I'm gonna go over the the
04:59 - changes that I've made and then we're
05:06 - gonna start into style some things
05:09 - there's a few things that are really
05:10 - obvious that need style because they
05:12 - just look a little bit weird and some
05:14 - other areas where it already looks ok
05:16 - we're just gonna make it look a little
05:17 - bit better I am gonna start my comodoro
05:22 - timer I'd like to get at probably like 2
05:25 - or 3 sessions and depending on how many
05:28 - questions we have and how many you know
05:32 - how many people are in the in the live
05:34 - chat so I'd like to get at least two
05:36 - sessions and we'll see how it goes if
05:40 - you're not familiar with the strain the
05:43 - way things go
05:44 - is this is just my everyday work that
05:47 - I'm doing so whatever I need to work on
05:49 - in my normal job as a front-end
05:52 - developer I work on and I share it all
05:56 - with you
05:56 - I organize my work normally with in
06:00 - Pomodoro sessions so we do 25-minute
06:03 - code sessions and then in between we
06:04 - take five-minute breaks and I answer
06:06 - questions in the lab chat at the end of
06:08 - the stream I answer all the questions
06:12 - that that you all put in the live chat I
06:14 - welcome any questions and also comments
06:17 - and advice in the live chat as well
06:21 - let's see I think that's my normal I
06:26 - need to write down like my normal
06:29 - explanation for the channels I don't
06:32 - forget and then I can just rattle it off
06:33 - at the beginning also I have a secondary
06:36 - stream on Instagram so if you're
06:39 - watching on
06:40 - Instagram you can see my my monitors and
06:44 - all the code at free code camp on their
06:47 - YouTube channel so check out that
06:49 - YouTube channel and this video is titled
06:55 - styling react components in this project
06:58 - to day 30 so check that out if you want
07:02 - to see the code otherwise you'll just be
07:03 - seeing my face which won't be that
07:04 - helpful if you'd like to know more about
07:08 - styling react components all right so
07:12 - let's let's get started just you know
07:15 - really quickly showing what I've done
07:16 - the mainly my work has been other than
07:19 - setting up the server my work has been
07:21 - on this service request form if you
07:25 - remember we had a branch that was the
07:27 - file type check branch and we were doing
07:31 - some work with form validation on that
07:33 - branch that's now been merged into
07:34 - master I got it to the point where I
07:36 - thought you know it was it was ready not
07:39 - perfect but functional and so that's
07:43 - merged now in the master so if you're
07:45 - checking out the repository the links in
07:48 - the description the master branch now
07:51 - has has everything in it there are no
07:53 - side branches that are being worked on
07:55 - currently so here's what I've done and
07:59 - you can see so this is what it it did
08:04 - look like with the check boxes so we had
08:06 - basically you know these icons when you
08:09 - clicked it it just came up with an alert
08:11 - basically just to say like hey it works
08:14 - when you click on this and we had the
08:15 - check boxes now I've redone the check
08:20 - boxes so that a few few improvements so
08:24 - this was a really big step done by
08:27 - Sebastian and I just kind of finished
08:29 - that up over here and that now depending
08:33 - on what data you pass into the component
08:35 - you could get an icon that icon could be
08:39 - whatever you want it doesn't have to be
08:41 - the information icon and then when you
08:44 - click on it a modal opens you can pass
08:47 - in a title and then you can pass in HTML
08:53 - style you know however you want and
08:55 - currently this is this is what we have
08:58 - so just you know regular unordered list
09:01 - I'll show you all the code for this also
09:06 - you know the check boxes work now we
09:09 - have a separate component that so we're
09:12 - passing you know the click event up to
09:17 - the parent component which is this whole
09:18 - page I'll show you how that works so
09:21 - what I ended up doing was I split if you
09:26 - remember our problem was trying to get
09:28 - the check box and the icon together and
09:34 - being able to click on it get different
09:37 - information so that was we were just
09:41 - trying to figure out the best way to do
09:42 - that I think at some point last week so
09:44 - this is what I came up with so now
09:47 - instead of doing all this in the service
09:49 - request form which is already getting
09:51 - quite large
09:53 - I just separated out into another
09:55 - component so this is called the icon
09:58 - check box component so here's what we're
10:02 - doing the only state that we're even
10:07 - tracking here is just for the modal
10:10 - we're leaving the state for the check
10:13 - box itself whether or not it's checked
10:15 - here in the parent component of service
10:18 - request j/s because we want all that
10:22 - data all that form data to stay in state
10:25 - here so we can send it you know we can
10:28 - read that we can send it off to our
10:31 - server j/s file and then handle all that
10:34 - form data from there so that's why I
10:36 - left it here otherwise normally I would
10:41 - handle you know component state I mean
10:44 - assuming I wasn't you know using some
10:47 - other state management technique but for
10:51 - something basic I will probably just
10:54 - handle state right here in the component
10:56 - like I'm doing here but it makes more
11:00 - sense in this case to do it the parent
11:02 - component and I'm not using Redux or
11:04 - anything like that for this so I usually
11:06 - get people
11:07 - are you using redox or why don't you use
11:09 - redox so this is a simple enough react
11:14 - project that I didn't really think it
11:16 - needed Redux I'm also not that great
11:18 - with Redux yet to even be confident and
11:22 - implementing it but I am trying to learn
11:25 - currently on on another project okay so
11:29 - pretty basic we just have a handle
11:32 - dialogue open handle dialogue close okay
11:34 - this is nothing different than what
11:35 - we're already doing in this component
11:36 - with our dialogue for when when you
11:41 - submit the form so we actually didn't
11:43 - have a handle dialog open because that
11:47 - was handled in the form submission
11:49 - function so we just added that in now
11:54 - down here we have our check box and this
11:58 - is our material UI check box but then
12:02 - depending on the value for icon
12:06 - I think it's passed and let me show you
12:08 - on on the right side where we pass this
12:10 - in you can see this is a very large
12:17 - component it's
12:23 - yeah down here down here there we go
12:31 - I'm think I'm gonna make this a bit
12:34 - bigger a bit wider here it'll be a lot
12:38 - easier to read okay so here we go here's
12:43 - our icon check box components and you
12:45 - see it's capable of taking in a lot of a
12:48 - lot of properties so we're passing in
12:54 - things for the check box and these are
12:56 - all just normal things that you pass in
12:59 - for the material you I component the
13:02 - same thing that we're doing right down
13:04 - here this these checkboxes are the old
13:07 - way that we were doing it okay so it's
13:11 - the same thing the only thing that's
13:12 - even you know slightly different here is
13:14 - and on check we pass the event up right
13:21 - to our handle check here and then it
13:25 - calls handle input change and passes
13:27 - that event on right you see otherwise
13:30 - right we all we had to do was on check
13:34 - call handle input change but now that
13:37 - we've put this into another component we
13:40 - have to pass that event I actually had I
13:45 - had a big I spent a lot of time trying
13:50 - to troubleshoot this because I couldn't
13:51 - get it to work and it turns out I was
13:53 - doing everything right except I was
13:57 - passing in label here instead of name so
14:02 - it was trying to update the information
14:04 - in state for a component that didn't
14:08 - even exist I'm sorry for a checkbox that
14:11 - didn't exist right because the labels
14:13 - uppercase but the name is lowercase so
14:16 - anyway that was pretty frustrating
14:20 - definitely would have saved like a half
14:22 - an hour of kind of back-and-forth
14:25 - troubleshooting if I would have just
14:28 - passed in the right prop so that happens
14:34 - sometimes
14:35 - so anyway the checkbox like I said other
14:39 - than this it operates exactly the same
14:42 - and here's the kind of the new portion
14:45 - so if this is true so we have C we have
14:51 - icon here so basically within our data I
14:56 - guess I should share the data because
14:57 - that might make a little bit more sense
14:58 - so here's our data for our checkboxes so
15:02 - we can pass in a lot more now than we
15:04 - were before see before we basically a
15:06 - name info you can either put an icon
15:10 - false like we're doing here or it'll
15:13 - check and if the icon data doesn't even
15:16 - exist it'll automatically pass in false
15:18 - so I filled this in before I put this
15:21 - check in for that so but it really
15:24 - doesn't matter I'll probably end up
15:26 - taking out the icon false just to keep
15:28 - things a little bit a little bit shorter
15:32 - in here but in this case for that first
15:36 - check box you can see we're passing in
15:38 - the name the info text I'm actually not
15:42 - using this now so I'll get rid of this
15:45 - this was Sebastian and put this in just
15:48 - kind of more as an example like hey
15:50 - here's where you put in your data so we
15:55 - do have icon true now here's where we
15:58 - have that everything for the modal so we
16:01 - get passing the title for the modal and
16:03 - then for dialogue text we put in our
16:05 - HTML and I have this inside a template
16:09 - literal that way I don't have to worry
16:11 - about using single or double quotes
16:13 - inside of here it's just it's kind of
16:17 - easy I think I'm only using a single
16:18 - quote yeah so you know right here but
16:24 - potentially I could be using them you
16:26 - know in more places so if you can use
16:31 - template literal definitely recommend
16:34 - that if you're gonna put a lot of
16:36 - content in there so you can see this is
16:39 - just you know regular HTML normally I
16:42 - wouldn't want to have like huge blocks
16:44 - of HTML in here but we're not really
16:47 - gonna do this often in fact this my
16:49 - be the only checkbox that even gets
16:51 - extra info so we'll see maybe once the
16:57 - people in my department see that this is
16:59 - possible they might want extra info for
17:01 - some other things as well but I don't
17:04 - think we'll have anything nearly this
17:05 - big otherwise our data file is gonna get
17:09 - huge okay so there's our data and you
17:14 - can see we're passing that in so here's
17:17 - the icon so we have this as an image and
17:21 - then our source is just gonna be our
17:25 - source from the source with the SVG is
17:29 - so let me go up to the top here's who
17:31 - we're bringing in that so we're
17:33 - importing info logo from image info dot
17:37 - SVG all right so we're pulling that in
17:39 - here and then we're passing it in props
17:41 - so we could pass in anything we wanted
17:44 - in terms of a logo really we could bring
17:49 - in a source for an image if we wanted to
17:51 - I guess I don't know how great that
17:55 - would look probably not that good since
17:57 - we're intending it to be a logo but and
18:03 - then we are also putting in an alt tag
18:06 - currently I think I just have hard-coded
18:09 - let me double check on that I do it just
18:15 - says info button really I think we just
18:19 - need an alt or else it'll react I'll
18:22 - complain either reactor I don't know if
18:25 - it's specific to create rec react app
18:27 - but I'm pretty sure that's what was
18:28 - happening before so I mean it's a good
18:31 - idea to have alt text anyway if I get a
18:36 - new situation where I have lots of
18:37 - different logos in here then I'd
18:40 - probably want to put it in our data file
18:42 - and pass incorrect
18:44 - alt text but right now the only thing
18:49 - we're gonna have our info button so that
18:50 - works all right and that's it to get the
18:55 - the logo and we have you know some
18:57 - positioning here but other than that we
19:01 - have our dialogue so this
19:03 - is our material UI dialog component and
19:07 - we're just passing in the title and then
19:09 - here this is how we can use the HTML so
19:15 - inside of this dialog component I have a
19:17 - span and we're dangerously setting the
19:20 - inner HTML you can't do that on the
19:22 - actual dialog component itself because
19:25 - this component ends up outputting you
19:28 - know several other divs inside of it so
19:32 - I've tried tried it it does not work so
19:36 - you need to put a span inside and then
19:39 - anything inside here is going to be put
19:41 - in the right place within that modal
19:44 - within that dialog so we just have a
19:46 - span here we're setting the dangerously
19:49 - setting the interests UML if we didn't
19:51 - do it like this then the user would
19:53 - actually see all the HTML tags when you
19:57 - do this though it's a good idea to only
19:58 - do this if you have complete control of
20:00 - the data you're not gonna have like
20:02 - users submitted data in there but as
20:06 - long as you have control your data this
20:07 - is fine even though it it seems
20:09 - dangerous it's it's completely fine if
20:12 - if you know for sure what's going to be
20:15 - coming through here okay and that's
20:19 - that's pretty much it that's all I've
20:21 - done yeah at least that's all I can
20:25 - remember that I've done since yesterday
20:28 - so I just need to apply that same thing
20:30 - to this side and we need to do a bit of
20:32 - styling so that we don't have this huge
20:34 - gap between checkboxes so we can come
20:39 - back to that styling but I'd like to
20:43 - work on the home page first all right
20:46 - because this is what this will people
20:48 - are gonna see right off the bat if
20:49 - there's any page I want to spend the
20:50 - most time on in terms of style it's
20:53 - definitely going to be the home page
20:55 - it's entirely possible that the majority
20:58 - of people won't see you know a lot of
21:01 - these other these other views but we
21:04 - know you know this looks really plain
21:06 - I'd like to put in I have some ideas for
21:10 - what I'd like to put in so let's just
21:11 - try them out and see if you all have any
21:14 - ideas for what
21:15 - make this look a bit less plain I mean
21:20 - I'm I'm really I like the clean look but
21:23 - this is almost sterile you know it's
21:25 - it's like beyond clean at this point so
21:28 - like to add a little bit in maybe a
21:31 - little bit of color possibly some icons
21:34 - we'll see I don't want to go crazy with
21:36 - the icons then it's it's just kind of
21:38 - hard you know you want to try to find
21:42 - different types of icons when you end up
21:44 - throwing things in there that don't even
21:46 - they don't then make sense so I'd rather
21:51 - not put an IKE I'd rather not just throw
21:53 - in icons just for something to look at
21:55 - if they don't mean really mean anything
21:59 - so first we're just going to try adding
22:02 - in some color and see how that looks
22:05 - like I said I wonder trying to get about
22:12 - the screen this is more like the screen
22:14 - size that's common here at the
22:16 - University so I'd like to try try to
22:21 - keep that in mind as we're styling this
22:25 - so my monitor is way bigger than the
22:30 - normal screen size of people that work
22:35 - here yeah I think that's about it off
22:39 - the double check the analytics and see
22:41 - what kind of screens we get mostly I do
22:45 - want to double check the live chat let's
22:49 - see
22:55 - okay I just want to remember to check in
22:58 - case you know occasionally I'm doing
23:00 - something really wrong and you all let
23:04 - me know a lot in the live chat so didn't
23:06 - want to go too long without at least
23:07 - taking a peek at it here's what I'm
23:12 - thinking I'd like to maybe put a border
23:17 - on the left of each of these titles and
23:23 - I'd like to mess around with some of the
23:26 - different colors that are available in
23:28 - the university's color palette and just
23:33 - see how it looks
23:35 - I'm not you know I kind of have an idea
23:39 - in my head of how it will look but you
23:41 - never know until you really you know get
23:44 - it on there and see not really sure how
23:49 - would it look to with the colors you
23:51 - know should we do more than one how many
23:55 - more should we alternate so let's just
23:58 - do it and see what it looks like
24:00 - so this
24:14 - maybe we'll put
24:19 - I think I'd like to add a class to this
24:29 - I guess to this span yeah we're gonna
24:32 - have to do it to this span
24:45 - let's see let's check out our components
24:47 - see how this is we may not be able to
24:49 - easily add a class but if we just select
24:53 - the first fan I think we should be fine
24:56 - so let's see we're using the component
24:59 - for a components generic car that's it
25:08 - yes we're using a generic card and card
25:13 - header so there's the title okay so it's
25:20 - in the card title okay I don't want to
25:28 - put it in this style here because like
25:32 - we saw here
25:34 - this applies I should make this a bit
25:37 - bigger it's easy for you to see see if
25:43 - you can see here that styling is applied
25:45 - - I believe that's applied to this div
25:55 - and if I try to put a border on this dev
25:58 - it's gonna be bigger than we want so I
26:02 - want to target that span yeah
26:08 - all right let's do that let's just try
26:11 - to do it in in CSS then unless I mean
26:20 - it's possible that there's a way to
26:22 - target that interior span with material
26:27 - UI but I'm guessing not just from what
26:29 - I've seen from the other components that
26:31 - we worked with so let's go leave our
26:35 - home dot s CSS file and let's actually
26:44 - bring out our home component and
27:20 - the card container all right let's see
27:25 - if this will allow us to to get that
27:31 - span there we go so we have
27:43 - okay
27:50 - all right that should work
27:58 - I guess I could have just used flex then
28:00 - like I did up here but if I'm using what
28:05 - I want to avoid is having these styles
28:08 - spill over into other places where I
28:11 - don't want them so that's why we added
28:12 - this here
28:22 - okay and I will say when you're doing
28:25 - styles for react there are so many ways
28:28 - right now to do it this is just one of
28:32 - those those ways there are a lot of
28:34 - different ways to do your CSS right in
28:38 - the component and then in this
28:41 - particular way we're using sass which
28:44 - certainly don't have to use so I don't I
28:48 - don't want to make it seem like this is
28:49 - the way to do it this is just one way to
28:51 - do it and in fact we did it very
28:53 - differently on the last project so if
28:56 - you want to see an alternative you could
28:58 - check that out but we just you know we
29:00 - happen to be doing it this way on this
29:02 - project I I have not made up my mind as
29:05 - to what way I like the best so I'm still
29:08 - kind of trying different things out and
29:10 - hopefully at some point I'll settle on
29:13 - on some consistent way of doing it but
29:16 - I'm not there yet okay and let's go with
29:26 - for now we can just target the span
29:29 - because the other span right now is a
29:35 - height of zero pixels so I mean we'll
29:40 - see in a second but it shouldn't it
29:42 - shouldn't do anything if we put a border
29:44 - on that so let's go the border left and
29:53 - solid let's try let's try two pixels we
29:59 - may have to go three but I want to see
30:01 - what - looks like first and then I don't
30:07 - what color I want to try first
30:09 - I'm gonna grab let's grab this color
30:17 - and I need to set up my sash right now
30:24 - is not set up it's not taking advantage
30:28 - of a lot of things that SAS can do and
30:31 - it should it should be just haven't
30:34 - really taken the time to get everything
30:36 - set up properly yet you know normally we
30:39 - would want to be importing all our
30:40 - variables into our SAS files so that we
30:44 - could use those variables so you know
30:46 - for sure our color variables your color
30:49 - palette we want to have them be all
30:51 - variables but you know probably some
30:53 - other things as well all right yeah
30:56 - that's terrible I don't like that okay
31:01 - here's what we need to do all right so
31:09 - this definitely needs to be more than
31:10 - two pixels I'm gonna go three pixels
31:13 - right now and yeah I don't like that
31:23 - all right let's try this out so let's
31:27 - decrease our line height
31:36 - we're gonna make our lion height the
31:38 - same as our font size now that brings
31:41 - this kind of shrinks it up a little bit
31:43 - too much but okay so that's in line so
31:50 - we're gonna have to use important we're
31:57 - gonna have to use important to override
31:59 - those inline Styles you do want to be
32:02 - careful when you use important because
32:06 - obviously it's it's going to be more
32:09 - difficult if you you're basically
32:12 - undoing the cascading nature of
32:16 - cascading style sheets when you use
32:18 - something like this so you don't use it
32:20 - all the time but in this case this is
32:23 - just so much easier than trying to dig
32:24 - into the components and figure out I
32:30 - just really don't want to edit the
32:32 - material UI components directly I'd
32:35 - rather try to do things on top of that
32:37 - and we want to add in some padding left
32:46 - of let's try four pixels we'll see how
32:50 - that looks okay all right yeah I like
32:53 - that
32:54 - [Music]
33:01 - and we won margin what a margin on the
33:12 - bottom and the top of let's go with
33:21 - eight pixels and then went zero on the
33:25 - sides okay yeah that gives us back to
33:30 - the same spacing that we had originally
33:32 - or at least pretty close to it now I
33:39 - think I'd like to have our text lined up
33:44 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go
33:49 - we'll go we'll keep our eight pixels on
33:51 - top we'll go zero on the right and then
33:54 - we'll do eight pixels on the bottom and
33:56 - then on the left I'm gonna go with
33:58 - negative let's see we're doing padding
34:02 - there four pixels let's go negative
34:05 - let's it's gonna probably gonna be too
34:08 - much we'll try it first just to start
34:09 - okay that's not bad it's pretty close
34:19 - yeah I think seven seven is better right
34:24 - that makes sense because we've added a 4
34:26 - pixel padding left and then we have a 3
34:28 - pixel border so 7 pixels puts us back
34:34 - where you were that way we have our text
34:36 - lined up I think that looks a bit nicer
34:40 - let me know what you think though okay
34:43 - so we have this did we put our padding
34:49 - in already I think I'm gonna copy both
34:51 - of these
34:55 - and we're gonna have to use did I add
35:00 - these I don't think we'll have to use
35:04 - important because I think I added these
35:06 - both in so let's see if it works I'm
35:11 - gonna save that yep all right so it did
35:14 - work so now we have a little bit of
35:19 - color I'm not I don't really know if I
35:25 - like it or not let's see my timer did go
35:29 - off a few minutes ago and I just wanted
35:31 - to finish that up so you have something
35:32 - to look at I'm gonna take a short break
35:34 - now and go to the live chat and see what
35:38 - you all think and also if there's any
35:40 - questions I'll try to answer as many as
35:42 - I can in this is five minutes
36:08 - okay so John John Hanson says I believe
36:15 - most react components work best passing
36:17 - down function rather than passing up is
36:21 - this true JavaScript and suffer from
36:23 - bubbling can this happen in react to yet
36:31 - I guess I think this question probably
36:36 - came when we were going over the icon
36:38 - checkbox and passing us up so basically
36:42 - yeah normally you do want to pass things
36:44 - down to from parent to child and react
36:47 - but sometimes you have to in certain
36:51 - situations like this one you you do have
36:55 - a child component and it needs to let
36:58 - the parent component know what's
37:00 - happening normally I've only had this
37:04 - situation happen where I have inputs
37:07 - that are in child components and I need
37:10 - to let the parent component know if
37:13 - something is changed with that input so
37:16 - there are probably other situations
37:19 - where you'd want to but I haven't dealt
37:21 - with them yeah yeah probably inputs are
37:29 - the the main thing so in that case I I
37:34 - think I haven't found any negative let's
37:38 - see side effects from from doing it like
37:40 - that not to say that they don't exist I
37:43 - just haven't encountered them yet
37:48 - [Music]
37:51 - pravin ask what is react learning curve
37:54 - I mean how much time will it take for
37:56 - basic JavaScript developer angularjs new
37:59 - developer to learn react jeaious and
38:02 - react native it's hard to say how much
38:07 - time really because that depends it
38:09 - depends on how much time you have to
38:11 - dedicate to it every day that I get to
38:14 - learning it and how quick of a learner
38:16 - you are and how much you already know so
38:20 - it's really it would be hard
38:21 - to say I can only speak for myself I
38:26 - started working with reacts I want to
38:32 - say it's been less than a year since
38:34 - I've been working with react so it took
38:37 - me it took me probably a few months
38:41 - before I before I actually launched a
38:44 - react site for a client before that you
38:48 - know I I just done some some things just
38:52 - to learn really I didn't have all day to
38:57 - dedicate to it I was working on other
38:59 - projects that weren't you know where I
39:02 - wasn't using react so I would I would
39:06 - say if you could dedicate let's say you
39:08 - could dedicate all your time to it you
39:11 - can get pretty good with reacting in a
39:13 - month or less you know I'm talking like
39:15 - full-time learning you know building
39:18 - things otherwise if you're working a
39:22 - full-time job you know you have those
39:23 - projects you know I'd say a couple of
39:26 - months but like I said it's really hard
39:28 - to say it's it's kind of an individual
39:30 - thing there's a lot of factors that
39:31 - would go into that some guy responds
39:38 - respond to that question learn
39:40 - JavaScript first at least the basics up
39:42 - to objects and go through x6 then start
39:46 - learning concepts of react mainly
39:48 - components yes I mean you're definitely
39:53 - going to need to know some JavaScript to
39:57 - be able to know react you don't need to
39:59 - be an expert in JavaScript oh certainly
40:01 - you'll your JavaScript skills will get
40:04 - better as you learn react as well so if
40:07 - you if you did want to jump into react
40:11 - it's it's probably fine you know if you
40:14 - have limited knowledge of JavaScript
40:16 - it'll just be harder to get through
40:18 - react but you know eventually your
40:20 - skills will they'll have to get better
40:22 - if you want to be good at react
40:28 - perviness
40:29 - is es6 necessary to learn react
40:33 - I don't necessary to know all of the
40:41 - Essex but es6 will help make things
40:46 - easier I mean even even just the
40:49 - syntactic sugar part of es6 will make
40:52 - things easier but yeah I would say it's
40:57 - not like there's that much to es6 or
40:59 - es2015 whatever I I read a comment to a
41:03 - blog post earlier where somebody was so
41:06 - mad that someone said es8 instead of es
41:10 - 2017 so I don't wanna make anybody mad
41:13 - officially I think it's we're going with
41:15 - the es 2015 16 17 but in any case yeah
41:22 - you can get started with react without
41:24 - great knowledge of es6 but it's your
41:28 - life will be easier if you learn it and
41:36 - then Praveen says can you suggest some
41:38 - links or references to learn and let's
41:45 - see some suggestions were Codecademy
41:49 - yeah I've done their react stuff that's
41:51 - good Udacity has a react course it's
41:55 - paid though so it depends on your budget
41:57 - for you know for learning materials for
42:02 - react if you want to stick with the free
42:04 - stuff code Academy is good and then I
42:07 - mean there's so many YouTube videos that
42:08 - could be helpful lets trying to think
42:14 - learn code Academy is a YouTube channel
42:17 - that has a lot of good videos and has
42:19 - some serious on react actually earlier
42:21 - today I was just watching a video on
42:22 - Redux on that channel I think will Stern
42:26 - is the guy that does all the videos on
42:28 - that channel so you can check that out
42:30 - the react tutorials on that channel are
42:33 - a little bit older so there might be
42:35 - some updates to the way things are done
42:37 - but the overall concepts are still the
42:40 - same and react so those would be just
42:43 - off the top of my head that's
42:47 - probably one of the best channels that
42:50 - I've personally watched for react stuff
42:54 - on YouTube and then certainly you know
42:57 - these streams you'll pick up a lot about
43:00 - react on these streams but these you
43:02 - know it's not really a tutorial so
43:07 - there'll be a lot of gaps like this is
43:10 - not a systematic way of learning react
43:12 - it's just you get to see what I happen
43:15 - to be doing at 2:00 p.m. every day
43:27 - okay
43:29 - all right my time I did go off so I'm
43:34 - not through the chat so I'm gonna have
43:36 - to come back to that so if I didn't get
43:38 - to your question yet don't worry I'll
43:39 - get to it in our next break or towards
43:43 - the end of the stream and if you can't
43:48 - stick around for the live stream to get
43:49 - the answer you can always check out the
43:51 - recording that's available on a free
43:53 - code camp YouTube channel later on and
43:58 - then you'll be able to hear the answer
44:03 - answer there let's see all right let's
44:09 - reset this do another 25-minute session
44:12 - okay I'm gonna scroll down to the bottom
44:13 - and see if anyone had any comments on
44:16 - the styles okay all right so John Hanson
44:25 - is not a fan of the border on the left
44:31 - okay I don't think I'm thinking anybody
44:35 - else so if anybody else has an opinion
44:36 - on this let me know like I said after I
44:39 - saw it I'm not I don't hate it but I'm
44:44 - not I'm not sure that this is exactly
44:46 - what what we need here I mean I think
44:54 - maybe it's better than nothing
45:02 - it's part of the thing that that is
45:07 - bothering me about this too is that we
45:09 - have this this one card this the title
45:15 - is going it down on the two lines
45:16 - there's not really anything we can do
45:18 - about that
45:28 - yes
45:36 - I mean we can try you know know what I
45:45 - would like to try I think I want this
45:52 - text this how can Markham help you text
45:55 - to be permanently closer to the top and
45:58 - then have these centered so basically
46:04 - right now
46:06 - this is vertically centered but the
46:09 - entire div is vertically centered
46:11 - including this so what what happens is
46:15 - all of this appears to not be centered
46:17 - it appears to be towards the bottom more
46:19 - so what I'd like to do is take this out
46:21 - of that div so this isn't taken into
46:23 - consideration for the centering and then
46:26 - have these come up a little bit I think
46:30 - depending on the screen size it's not
46:32 - going to be that big of a difference but
46:35 - I do think it'll help it will help out a
46:40 - blank space on the bottom is not as big
46:45 - of a deal as blank space on the top when
46:47 - there's blank space on the top it really
46:49 - I think feels like there's something
46:50 - missing but the bottom of the page is
46:54 - you know that's just the bottom right
46:56 - it's not as big of a deal at least I
46:59 - don't know at least in my mind that's
47:01 - that's how it seems to me so let's uh
47:08 - let's do that I want to do that for sure
47:10 - and then we can think more about what
47:12 - we're gonna do in terms of color in here
47:15 - John says how about a four pixel top
47:18 - border on each card with the same color
47:22 - okay so we could do yeah I guess I guess
47:30 - we could try that so we'll try that too
47:33 - let me get rid of this because I know
47:35 - for sure that I want to kind of mess
47:40 - with this vertical centering a bit and
47:42 - then we'll try that border on the top so
47:44 - John just just to be clear are we
47:48 - talking like
47:49 - border that stretches completely across
47:52 - the card I think that would look the
47:55 - best I'm assuming that's what we're
47:57 - talking about
48:07 - okay John also says don't take the
48:09 - heading out of the div just add padding
48:11 - to the bottom to Center it better all
48:17 - right let's see
48:20 - that's it we'll make this bigger just to
48:22 - kind of exaggerate the issue as well so
48:25 - we can see what's going on here I'm just
48:33 - I'm wondering would it look see it
48:37 - because in this case it's really obvious
48:39 - you know if we had this so that it was
48:41 - always up at the top you know there's a
48:43 - huge difference here
48:56 - I'm kind of wondering if maybe it was a
48:58 - mistake to vertically Center this maybe
49:07 - it would be better if this was just you
49:10 - know at the top I don't know let me know
49:17 - what you all think about that is
49:19 - originally we did not have this
49:20 - vertically centered and I said it's not
49:24 - as big of a deal on a smaller screen
49:27 - when you end up getting into larger
49:32 - sizes it's just there's just so much
49:34 - space up here I don't I don't know that
49:39 - that that looks right all right so let's
49:46 - we'll try a few things and see see what
49:50 - looks best
50:04 - okay so here's our
50:14 - actually let's just let's take this out
50:17 - and see what it would look like that'll
50:20 - be the easiest thing to check so here's
50:25 - what it looks like without being
50:26 - vertically centered
50:46 - okay I
50:51 - yeah I like I think this looks good and
50:55 - it looks like at least a few you agree
50:59 - much better okay great yeah I agree I
51:03 - think that does look a lot better I
51:05 - can't I can't remember what we were
51:10 - thinking originally with that vertical
51:11 - Center I mean it was cool when we did it
51:14 - at least it was a nice demonstration of
51:15 - how to do a vertical Center with with
51:18 - flexbox but yeah definitely definitely
51:24 - looks better okay we'll leave it like
51:26 - that now let's try out that that top
51:29 - border actually though I didn't think
51:33 - about this either but we could
51:35 - potentially do a a border on the side
51:38 - that takes up the entire height of the
51:42 - card so what do you think well I'll try
51:46 - them both we'll try a top border and
51:49 - then we'll also try the side border
51:51 - maybe I'll do it on on two different
51:54 - cards here so we can see it side by side
52:01 - okay
52:03 - maybe I can just do it right here in dev
52:05 - tools
52:14 - I'll get fry just copy copy this edit it
52:24 - a bit
52:39 - okay so here's our left our left border
52:48 - and let's do the same thing over here
52:53 - but we're gonna do top and we'll make
52:59 - this 4 as well okay
53:05 - all right so what do y'all think on the
53:08 - side on the top or I definitely don't
53:11 - think bottom would look good but we
53:13 - could we could try on the right as well
53:28 - okay Zachary asked if I'm feeling better
53:31 - I don't know I feel kind of the same so
53:36 - if you watch the last last show I was
53:40 - not feeling well so still about the same
53:43 - my throat hurts a little bit less than
53:46 - it did though so that's good but I
53:49 - started I'm a little bit congested so I
53:53 - don't know if I'm getting better it's
53:55 - just transitioning into something
53:57 - different but I'm still so just tired
54:01 - that's that's the worst thing is like I
54:03 - just I feel like I have no energy but
54:05 - I'm starting to get some of my focus
54:07 - back I feel like today the last like two
54:11 - weeks I just feel like my work has not
54:13 - been great I don't know if it's been
54:15 - evident in the streams or not but it
54:18 - just feels I don't know I feel like I'm
54:22 - not doing good work like I'm having
54:24 - trouble focusing on my work and so
54:28 - anyway today I finally like really made
54:32 - an effort to really try to focus and
54:34 - like work through the the tiredness and
54:36 - I think I did I think I did a decent job
54:39 - on that logo checkbox component and I
54:43 - worked through some some bugs and stuff
54:46 - and so hopefully this is the start of me
54:50 - getting back into it but just just tired
54:52 - and just lack of motivation that's
54:55 - what's bothering me the most anyway
54:58 - thanks for asking Zachary sorry for the
55:00 - big explanation I know you all may not
55:05 - have wanted that much information but it
55:07 - I wanted to give everybody a chance to
55:09 - weigh in on these anyway so it was a
55:11 - good point a good time to talk a bit all
55:18 - right so I'm gonna check out what
55:20 - everyone said okay so it looks like left
55:28 - left just listening to service
55:36 - okay so oh man so we did have a bunch of
55:41 - votes four on the left on the side now
55:43 - we have some for the top someone did say
55:47 - so Laura said make it at the left border
55:50 - when you mouse-over all right so we
56:00 - don't we don't really have consensus
56:02 - here here's what I'm gonna do I think it
56:08 - might be better if we saw what it would
56:10 - look like if all of them had had the
56:13 - border so we'll try I'll do all of them
56:17 - with the the top border I'll take a
56:21 - screenshot and we'll do all with the
56:23 - border on the side and then we can look
56:24 - at them side by side that might give us
56:26 - a better idea
56:27 - since we're we're kind of torn right now
56:31 - so let's take let's take this for now
56:35 - and okay so for now
56:47 - let's do this
56:51 - and instead let me check
57:08 - okay so try this one first oops and I'll
57:18 - get rid of this whoops I said it order
57:26 - laughs we were to that one okay so let
57:30 - me screenshot this loose
57:40 - let me make sure that worked I don't
57:46 - think it did
57:57 - and I can't remember I just do one of
58:00 - these then I can't remember how to do a
58:02 - just a regular screenshot on on a Mac
58:08 - this one is gonna copy it to my
58:09 - clipboard how do I do it alright
58:14 - somebody help me out on a Mac what's the
58:17 - shortcut to do a screenshot that will
58:20 - automatically save to my desktop
58:22 - I always just use the one where it's
58:27 - copy to clipboard that's the command
58:29 - ctrl shift 4 is it
58:40 - okay there we go now I now I heard the
58:44 - little click command
58:55 - all right now weird this safe - I think
59:00 - this is it all right great
59:07 - okay so now we'll change it
59:22 - oops
59:32 - okay
59:36 - so
59:39 - not exactly equivalent here okay what do
59:49 - you think top or side now that we can
59:52 - see them side by side also I'm not
59:55 - opposed to some sort of hover effect so
59:57 - I mean obviously we already have I don't
60:05 - want to overdo it right we already have
60:07 - a hover effect going on here so if we
60:10 - were add anything else having to do with
60:12 - this border it wouldn't it would need to
60:15 - be subtle so I'll give everybody maybe
60:25 - like 20 seconds more to let me know what
60:29 - your thing
61:01 - okay it looks like all right we we have
61:06 - we have a lot of votes for left now
61:10 - we definitely have one for top we have
61:17 - an undecided
61:30 - Patrick says we could change maybe
61:32 - change the border color on hover yeah I
61:36 - think that's definitely I definitely
61:44 - want to see how it looks
61:46 - I'm not sure try to picture in my head
61:50 - I'm not sure if it'll work or not but I
61:52 - think it's worth a try I think we're
62:01 - gonna go with the left then it seems
62:04 - like it's now that we've seen them side
62:06 - by side it seems like it's pretty almost
62:09 - unanimous oh my goodness I keep my my
62:17 - slack channel for work is just going
62:20 - crazy I keep hearing the the noise that
62:22 - I've got a new message so I don't think
62:25 - I keep glancing at it it's nothing that
62:27 - I need to respond to you right now but
62:29 - it's a little bit distracting all right
62:35 - so let's go with this I do want to check
62:41 - let's let's see about changing the color
62:44 - also yeah we'll see about changing the
62:49 - color and then we'll see you know is
62:51 - this enough to make the page not quite
62:56 - so plain you know not not so stark so
63:01 - I'm still thinking about it
63:15 - now that I see this I wonder if I should
63:17 - get rid of the border-radius
63:20 - on this side if that would look nicer I
63:24 - know cards normally you're supposed to
63:26 - have a two picture border-radius of
63:27 - material design but with this border on
63:30 - the side I don't know that I like it
63:34 - being slightly rounded I mean that maybe
63:40 - I'm worrying too much about that but
63:42 - let's try that I do let's try getting
63:44 - rid of the border radius on this side
63:47 - with the border and then also doing a
63:49 - change of color on hover
64:05 - where it is top left
64:17 - oops I'm going bottom
64:43 - shoot how does he area
64:57 - let's try I don't know if I have any of
65:00 - the other colors we'll put this color in
65:03 - for now just to see may want to go with
65:07 - a different color there are a few
65:09 - there's a dark blue and a light blue
65:11 - that's in the the cool color palette for
65:14 - the University which is generally what I
65:16 - like to use for websites we have a warm
65:18 - color palette that has some Reds in
65:20 - there but I just I'm not crazy about how
65:23 - it looks on a screen it's definitely
65:26 - better for print materials let's show
65:29 - this up
65:38 - they don't get the auto reload hmm
65:45 - I bet you that I have to do all right so
65:49 - that works but I think for this I'll
65:50 - probably have to do important so I'm not
65:56 - even gonna check I'm just gonna do it
65:58 - since we're just testing this out anyway
66:04 - there we go
66:07 - okay so hmm
66:11 - you see the difference well I guess
66:14 - that's on the top
66:24 - hmm
66:29 - okay so I guess two things one what do
66:33 - you think about the color the change of
66:36 - color and the second thing is what about
66:40 - the border-radius
66:41 - I mean is it even noticeable let's
66:52 - I'm gonna get rid of that here and just
66:55 - try it try to just do it on one and dev
67:02 - tools
67:08 - okay so now we can see I guess better
67:12 - the difference so the top one has no
67:15 - border radius for this side and then
67:19 - this bottom one it has the normal two
67:21 - pixel border radius I don't know I want
67:30 - to know what you all think for me now
67:32 - that I look at this it I don't think it
67:36 - looks right it almost seems like this is
67:39 - now not part of the card especially
67:42 - around the edges like it just looks I
67:49 - don't know it looks like it's just added
67:51 - or like this definitely looks like it's
67:53 - within the card here I don't know what
67:55 - do y'all think
67:57 - use the green did I use the green yeah
68:03 - okay this it's it's probably just some
68:07 - type of weird thing going on with my
68:10 - eyes when the transition from the yellow
68:12 - but that this looks blue to me when I
68:15 - hover over it like this obviously looks
68:18 - green but for some reason this board is
68:21 - looking blue
68:29 - all right so Johnson keep the border
68:32 - radius
68:51 - okay
69:08 - alright Johnson the border color needs
69:10 - to be a bit softer so I'm assuming you
69:13 - mean like this yellow and so it seems
69:24 - like we're going to so we're not going
69:29 - to change the border radius and okay
69:38 - and then we're probably gonna soften
69:40 - this color or we could try different
69:44 - colors I need to bring in the some of
69:47 - the other the colors from the like the
69:50 - blues and stuff and see if one of those
69:52 - looks look good here as well I mean
69:54 - normally this yellow ends up being like
69:56 - the accent color anyway but I have used
70:01 - some of the Blues before and especially
70:06 - the the dark blue is nice I've used it
70:11 - before and it's it's pretty nice
70:14 - occasionally to use it's just not it's
70:19 - not really recognizable as a color for
70:21 - our University even though it is in the
70:22 - color palette it's not it's not often
70:24 - used but that was the end of my Poe
70:26 - Maduro session so I'm gonna do another
70:28 - five minutes to go back to the live chat
70:30 - I'm going to scroll back up to where I
70:32 - left off on our last break and go
70:36 - through and and just answer some more
70:38 - questions
70:46 - so I'm scrolling all the way up to the
70:50 - way the timestamp is 227 p.m. for me
70:53 - it'll be different depending on your
70:55 - timezone but that's Eastern Time 227
70:58 - p.m.
71:13 - okay
71:18 - say god says by the way great work all
71:22 - at pre-code camp thank you I appreciate
71:25 - that and at least thanks for the little
71:29 - bit that I'm doing things you're saying
71:31 - that I know there's a lot of people a
71:34 - lot of people don't work for free code
71:36 - camp and a lot of people that you never
71:37 - even hear about or don't you know don't
71:39 - know about so definitely the just a ton
71:46 - of volunteers making it making it have
71:49 - everything the free code camp does the
71:51 - YouTube channel the website the the
71:54 - blogs the forum a lot of a lot of
71:57 - volunteers behind all that
72:05 - Oh pravin mentioned YouTube's new
72:09 - dark-themed yeah I think the dark thing
72:13 - for YouTube is really cool so I just I
72:14 - just wanted to read that comment out so
72:16 - if you haven't checked it out yet check
72:19 - out the settings on on YouTube and try
72:23 - the dark theme I think I like dark
72:27 - themes for pretty much everything so I
72:30 - was really excited when that came out
72:37 - Juno says greetings from Costa Rica
72:41 - welcome thanks for watching
72:48 - Kat bill says styled components is is
72:51 - quite nice library for creating
72:53 - beautiful react components yeah yeah
72:57 - definitely I think before you know I was
73:01 - saying there's lots of different ways to
73:03 - style react components that's definitely
73:04 - one of the ways that that I've seen and
73:10 - like I said I'd like to try more of them
73:13 - out before I decide which one I want to
73:16 - stick with mainly no beer says hi from
73:20 - Bangladesh hey welcome thanks for
73:22 - watching
73:32 - Daniel says hi Jessie and guys from
73:36 - Romania hey Daniel welcome no beer says
73:42 - hi I'm new here
73:43 - well welcome really glad that that
73:47 - you're watching thank you and thanks for
73:49 - for letting us know that you're here in
73:51 - the live chat feel free to contribute or
73:54 - ask any questions and try to try to give
73:58 - you the best answers that I can and
74:00 - there's a lot of the really
74:01 - knowledgeable people here in the live
74:03 - chat that can definitely give you some
74:05 - great answers some guy asks are you
74:12 - using bootstrap for mobile responsive no
74:16 - I'm not using bootstrap I'm using the
74:18 - tier of UI so I guess it's not exactly
74:25 - the same as bootstrap since material I
74:27 - comes with these pre-made react
74:28 - components but it's the same concept in
74:30 - the sense that there's a lot of styling
74:32 - things that are that are already there
74:35 - although now that I think about it in
74:37 - terms of the responsiveness right some
74:41 - of that we did borrow from a framework
74:43 - called materialized CSS so which which
74:47 - is very much like bootstrap so
74:50 - essentially materialized is a material
74:53 - design CSS framework that does all the
74:56 - same things that bootstrap does but just
74:59 - in the material design style so we did
75:02 - borrow the mainly we borrow their column
75:06 - class system to help you know with the
75:10 - different screen sizes and kind of
75:12 - stacking the columns and things and we
75:14 - borrowed a few other things so so that's
75:18 - that's how we're handling responsiveness
75:20 - right now
75:30 - all right timer just is up so last one
75:35 - sir key gaming says I started free code
75:38 - camp about five days ago and got to the
75:40 - tribute page but it seems like hardly
75:42 - any of the things I learned stuck would
75:44 - you say that's normal or is there other
75:46 - things I can do let's see Lara's
75:53 - response to that it's normal just jump
75:55 - back and look over things go search on
75:58 - the web if you can't do things you want
76:00 - to do asking the Gator channel if you're
76:02 - really stuck yeah yeah definitely
76:07 - sometimes things don't stick the only
76:09 - way to really have things stick in your
76:11 - head is repetition I found and I don't
76:14 - mean in the sense of like getting it
76:16 - flashcards and memorizing like commands
76:19 - but just actually building things like
76:21 - day in day out you know building things
76:24 - with whatever you're trying to learn a
76:27 - little bit every day is much better than
76:29 - you know like twelve hours one day and
76:32 - then nothing for two weeks right so if
76:34 - you were to spread that out and just do
76:36 - you know an hour or so every day you're
76:40 - definitely going to get more out of that
76:42 - it's going to stay fresh in your brain
76:43 - and you know you you will remember that
76:46 - so alright let's go let me check the
76:51 - time okay what do you I'm trying to
77:01 - decide whether we should do another
77:02 - session or whether I should go to
77:04 - questions now we're already at about an
77:07 - hour and 20 minutes for the video if I
77:11 - do another session it's definitely going
77:12 - to be a two-hour video for sure I will
77:16 - my throat is I can feel my my throat
77:20 - just getting more sore as this goes on
77:22 - when I keep talking man
77:31 - let me see how much we have left in the
77:35 - in the chat I'm only about halfway
77:37 - through right now all right front so I
77:46 - think I'm not gonna do another Promotora
77:48 - session we only got two in but I think
77:54 - at this point I'd rather I'd rather end
77:57 - now and save my voice so that I can do
77:59 - sessions for the next two days then try
78:02 - to overdo it and lose my voice so at
78:09 - least we got we got through the homepage
78:11 - which as I said I think the homepage is
78:13 - the most important to get styling right
78:15 - this is the first thing people are going
78:17 - to see and they're gonna make a judgment
78:18 - on the site based on this so I don't
78:24 - know I think this looks a lot better
78:25 - from what we had just an hour ago
78:30 - definitely got a lot of good advice from
78:31 - you all so thanks and I'm definitely
78:36 - gonna mess around with the colors a bit
78:37 - and see see what color combinations
78:41 - might work and then I you know tomorrow
78:44 - we can we can check it out and review
78:48 - you know which colors look the best but
78:52 - for now so I'm gonna stop the code
78:55 - portion and I'm gonna go to the question
78:57 - and answer session so if you just here
78:59 - for the code and you can't stick around
79:00 - for the question answer session thank
79:02 - you so much for watching and I'll be
79:04 - back tomorrow so you know come back if
79:06 - you can and otherwise if you can stick
79:10 - around you have a few more minutes and
79:12 - if you have a question please put that
79:15 - in the live chat now I'll do my best to
79:17 - answer it and any any type of question
79:20 - don't worry if you think it's like a new
79:22 - question or anything you know don't
79:24 - worry about that you know I definitely
79:26 - want to be as welcoming as possible to
79:28 - people who are new and help you out any
79:30 - way that I can if you don't really have
79:34 - a question I appreciate you sticking
79:36 - around and helping to answer questions
79:38 - and a live chat you know if you can if
79:40 - you have the time
79:42 - so I said I'm about halfway through the
79:46 - live chat now so I'm just gonna keep on
79:48 - going down and try to answer things once
79:49 - we get through all the questions and
79:51 - I'll I'll be finished with the stream so
79:55 - I'm thinking we'll see probably
79:58 - streaming for at least another ten
80:00 - minutes kind of based on how many how
80:03 - much is left in the live chat but we'll
80:08 - see sometimes I talk for a while so
80:11 - we'll see definitely want to keep this
80:13 - below two hours just cuz just because
80:18 - I'm pretty tight
80:26 - alright shine as what is better react or
80:32 - view in the future well I mean I don't
80:37 - really know about what's gonna happen
80:38 - with them in the future and I'll say I
80:43 - don't think I can answer that question
80:44 - properly because I haven't used view yet
80:48 - I certainly have seen you know people
80:52 - who are well respected in the industry I
80:57 - guess and they really like view and they
81:00 - use it so I've you know I'm assuming
81:02 - that there's some really good things
81:03 - about view but I don't really know
81:06 - enough to do a comparison about it but
81:09 - in terms of react the only thing going
81:14 - against react right now that I see is
81:16 - like a serious thing that could threaten
81:18 - how widely it's used is the whole
81:23 - license thing you know there's a there's
81:26 - a lot of people that are freaking out
81:27 - over the license and I don't really know
81:30 - how many people but based on what's
81:32 - going on on Twitter it seems like a lot
81:34 - of people are now I know Twitter is just
81:37 - a small a small portion of all the
81:40 - people in the world and all the
81:41 - developers so maybe it's not as big of a
81:44 - deal as it seems like on Twitter but
81:46 - other than that it seems like react is
81:49 - pretty strong this there's more and more
81:52 - people developing with react if you look
81:54 - at like the trends just in terms of like
81:57 - Google search trends and things or the
82:00 - number of jobs that are you asking for
82:03 - reactive elders it's it's going strong
82:06 - it's still on the on the trend upward so
82:10 - I'm not really worried about react going
82:13 - anywhere anytime soon also I think
82:15 - there's a lot of opportunity in terms of
82:17 - react native and being able to use react
82:21 - for VR stuff I think that's really cool
82:25 - and potentially like depending on how
82:27 - quickly VR grows react could grow right
82:31 - along with that I don't know you know
82:35 - there's just a lot of a lot of what-ifs
82:37 - there but
82:40 - I think you're probably either either
82:44 - way with react or review you got at
82:47 - least a few more years before you'd have
82:49 - to think about learning something
82:51 - different
83:08 - okay you know what I did notice this
83:11 - before but Oh Morris had mentioned when
83:15 - we were doing these boxes to expand the
83:17 - boxes and it would be better huh that's
83:23 - interesting okay so yeah potentially I
83:31 - mean obviously on a smaller screen right
83:33 - there the boxes are fine but on a large
83:35 - screen there is quite a lot of space you
83:44 - know maybe maybe I should think about
83:51 - expanding them maybe adding some sort of
83:56 - at a certain breakpoint you know just
83:59 - having a minimum height and width well
84:06 - maybe I'll have to mess with that a
84:07 - little bit and see see what works if
84:10 - that looks a little bit better than then
84:13 - all this blank space I'd say thanks for
84:19 - that suggestion Omar
84:48 - okay our reo says thing is mouse-over
84:53 - already add shadow effect so we're
84:56 - talking about the shadow yeah I I agree
85:00 - there we do already have that shadow
85:02 - effect which is why I'm still not a
85:04 - hundred percent sure even about the
85:06 - color change thing I'm not I'm not
85:09 - totally against it but I just wonder is
85:12 - it necessary since we already have the
85:15 - the shadow you know getting the shadow
85:21 - increasing on hover I'm just I'm not
85:25 - really a big fan of doing too much on
85:28 - hover so we'll have to yeah I'll have to
85:36 - think about it
85:37 - I mean one bonus is if I decide not to
85:39 - do the color change thing and then we
85:41 - don't that's one less color I have to
85:43 - worry about picking so it simplifies it
85:46 - a bit if we do that I mean in terms of
85:51 - code it's it's trivial to add that
85:54 - effect you know it's just one line but
86:00 - in terms of thinking about the best
86:03 - color combination for that that's what
86:05 - that's what takes a lot that's what all
86:07 - second guess
86:25 - okay now I see a lot of people help me
86:28 - out with the shortcut for screenshotting
86:32 - on a Mac so thanks everyone who who
86:34 - answered that sorry I just totally
86:36 - forgot that that's your cut that happens
86:41 - sometimes I guess
87:10 - okay scrolling through actually a lot of
87:13 - the stuff in the live chat was based on
87:19 - just kind of what we were doing here so
87:21 - that's why I'm skipping over a lot of it
87:23 - because we've already talked about it
87:28 - somebody put a hex code in I want to see
87:32 - what the hex code is so I'm just I'm
87:34 - gonna put it in here but it's just
87:43 - popping in the background to see what it
87:45 - is okay I like that green color I can't
87:50 - use it here because I'm really kind of
87:52 - limited to the official color palette
87:56 - for the University but that's a really
88:00 - nice color anyway thanks you that Pavel
88:08 - thanks for they sue putting that X color
88:11 - in I kind of really it's like a nice
88:14 - like chill color green anyway just
88:18 - wanted to check it out we're not we're
88:19 - not gonna use that but I do like it
88:35 - get get seen says talk about sanitizing
88:39 - user inputs once you style them with
88:41 - styled components
88:43 - I guess did we do I don't think we've
88:52 - done anything on a stream about
88:54 - sanitizing input so maybe there's not
88:59 - going to be a lot of streams left before
89:01 - this projects finished but maybe I'll
89:04 - think about talking about that more on
89:08 - an on an upcoming stream one thing we
89:12 - don't because we don't have a database
89:17 - for this I'm not I'm not super worried
89:21 - about sanitizing inputs in terms of like
89:24 - I don't have to worry about something
89:25 - like like sequel injection there's
89:28 - something like that so I mean where I
89:32 - don't want to just allow anything so but
89:38 - it's not there's no danger of something
89:41 - weird happening with the database but
89:43 - anyway that's if I can in the few
89:47 - streams that we'll have left for this
89:49 - project I'll definitely talk about
89:52 - sanitizing user inputs Gouffran says
90:00 - sometimes using material design looks
90:02 - too generic for me no offense yeah
90:05 - that's the I think that's that's kind of
90:13 - what's happening with material design I
90:15 - don't completely disagree so I still
90:16 - like material design and I'm still going
90:19 - to continue to use it there's I think
90:22 - there's a lot of good reasons to use
90:24 - material design one of the main ones
90:26 - being it's there's just really common
90:33 - patterns design patterns in material
90:36 - design that a lot of people are familiar
90:38 - with now because of how widely it's used
90:41 - and I think there's a real benefit to
90:44 - that so that a user coming to your site
90:47 - or to your app
90:48 - would immediately be familiar with how
90:51 - the navigation works what certain icons
90:53 - mean you know not everybody will but you
90:57 - have there's a good chance that a decent
90:59 - portion of your audience will already be
91:01 - familiar with that and that to me is a
91:05 - really big benefit so I agree that
91:07 - sometimes it just looks generic and and
91:10 - that really is it's because it's used so
91:12 - widely it's just not you see it
91:16 - everywhere now
91:18 - so I like how clean it can look I mean
91:21 - that's really nice but I mean I agree to
91:25 - some extent that it's not I wouldn't use
91:28 - it if I was trying to win a design
91:30 - contest or something like that you know
91:32 - if I was doing some project on the side
91:33 - where I could be as creative as I wanted
91:35 - to be I would not use it but if I'm
91:38 - designing something and use your
91:41 - experience in terms of just usability
91:43 - ease of use was the main focus and you
91:48 - know design aesthetics where we're still
91:50 - important but not the main focus then
91:52 - I'm definitely going to use material
91:54 - design so anyway that's just that's my
91:57 - opinion on it I'm certainly open to
92:02 - hearing more one way the other about it
92:05 - but but in a sense I mean I don't I
92:10 - don't use material design necessarily
92:13 - because of the the look of it itself
92:17 - there's definitely other benefits that
92:22 - that it brings to the table you know
92:26 - more so than just the look John said
92:30 - gargle with warm salt water one of the
92:32 - best things for a sore throat thanks for
92:35 - telling me I'll definitely have to do
92:36 - that
92:37 - I always forget I know that helps but
92:40 - for some reason I always forget to do it
92:42 - oh I'll have to remember to do that
92:48 - bobble says thanks for the stream oh
92:50 - you're welcome papa
92:51 - thanks for watching and joining in in
92:54 - the live chat Bob also says my first
92:56 - time but I would like to continue these
92:57 - sessions
93:00 - no beer says me too yeah so that's
93:06 - really awesome that it's your first time
93:08 - for both of you and I'm really glad that
93:10 - you want to you know continue on with
93:11 - the sessions so definitely if you if you
93:14 - can make it four lives for the live
93:16 - streams that's really awesome because
93:18 - then we get to interact you know in real
93:19 - time but if you can't you know you can
93:24 - always check out the recordings one of
93:27 - the benefits of watching the recordings
93:29 - too is that you can watch it at a faster
93:31 - speed and get through it more quickly I
93:34 - listen to I had heard some of you say
93:38 - that you had listened to it at kind of a
93:40 - faster speed and I tried it over the
93:44 - weekend listening to my one of my
93:47 - streams at two times speed and I
93:50 - actually liked it a lot better into time
93:52 - speed I think I sound like I know what
93:56 - I'm talking about a lot more just
93:58 - because I'm saying it all faster and it
94:00 - looks like I'm typing faster too
94:02 - so it definitely makes me look better at
94:04 - two times speed so if you can't catch
94:07 - the lies chain check that out
94:16 - Antonius Asiya follow you in and Twitter
94:20 - best regards awesome well you're
94:24 - probably not here since you he said see
94:26 - ya but anyway in case you are here you
94:29 - see they're recording I appreciate
94:32 - refreshing you watching and definitely I
94:36 - hope you can come back for some more
94:39 - livestream soon no beer says I agree
94:43 - this color is so soft and looks nice
94:46 - yeah isn't it isn't it I I like I don't
94:50 - know what it is about this color but I'm
94:52 - really liking this color anyway alright
94:56 - so I'm at the the end of the live chat
94:59 - and I still have my voice so that's good
95:03 - but I think I need to get a cup of tea
95:05 - or something now I have her my throat
95:09 - but thank you so much for joining in in
95:13 - the live chat I really appreciate you
95:15 - all were so helpful especially when I do
95:18 - things like this and try to add some
95:20 - design elements that kind of go a little
95:24 - bit beyond this the general material
95:26 - design specifications it's so nice to
95:28 - have all of you be able to take a look
95:31 - at it and let me know what you think it
95:36 - just it's really nice I really I
95:39 - appreciate all your input I really
95:41 - respect your opinions on on this and so
95:45 - this is really awesome when we get to
95:47 - collaborate on something like this I
95:49 - think the end result is just way better
95:51 - than it would ever be if it was just me
95:52 - doing it
95:54 - so anyways Blake and Michelle said thank
95:59 - you you're welcome thank you so much for
96:01 - watching and for for being in the live
96:03 - chat and all right so I'm gonna wrap
96:07 - things up now thanks again everyone and
96:11 - I'll be back I'll be back tomorrow
96:14 - probably at the same time and yeah have
96:20 - a great day
96:23 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jessie and today we're gonna do some more beginner friendly stuff I guess so we're gonna work on styling so mainly be dealing with CSS with sass and possibly some of we'll be looking at the material UI documentation and trying to work with some of the options that already come with the components I'd rather work with the options than try to override it but we may have to just you know try to override some stuff with our own CSS if we have to do that that's okay too I want to catch catch everyone up to what I've been working on I guess the end of yesterday and for this morning so you can check out my Trello board and see kind of what's moved around there's a link in the description but mainly I have set up a server so I have a droplet on digitalocean I talked about going through the set up in a stream but I decided well for one I already did the exact same set up for a last project and I stream that so anybody who really wants to see that can go back to the last thing I stream the the other reason is simply because a lot of it is just following documentation and copy and pasting commands and that's much easier to do without making mistakes if I can focus and not have to worry about talking when I'm doing it and I was able to get though everything set up and in probably 40 minutes or less so it went it went really quickly you know I was able to focus so it's all set up it has its running ubuntu 16.04 nginx is the reverse proxy node and it's set up with a SSL and I pointed that obviously I pointed a domain name to it and set up the SSL and so that's already the last step is simply to just bring in the repository I'm just going to use git for that so right before the stream started I was just trying to set up the SSH keys in my github account so that I could just bring the bring the repository right in so the flow of updating will be I push from my local machine to github and then I pull from github into the server and then rebuild everything and the updates will be live at that point all right so let me say hate everybody in the lab chat get a few few you in there Alex asks is there a playlist for these videos yes there is a playlist and it's called I don't know this code let me check I think it's like maybe Jesse builds a react app live something like that I can if some if somebody knows put in the live set otherwise I'm gonna look it up on my other screen I add videos every day to this playlist you think I'd remember what the name of it is alright flail is okay the playlist is called Jesse builds a react project live that's the playlist for just this project project too if you want to see all the videos including project one the playlist is just live coding with Jesse at some point I should probably split them out into two different playlists but for now that how they're divided up so we are on day 29 no one day 30 so there are 29 videos currently in the playlist this is number 30 we will be finishing this project up pretty soon assuming there's not a lot of changes whenever this gets reviewed ok so quickly I'm gonna go over the the changes that I've made and then we're gonna start into style some things there's a few things that are really obvious that need style because they just look a little bit weird and some other areas where it already looks ok we're just gonna make it look a little bit better I am gonna start my comodoro timer I'd like to get at probably like 2 or 3 sessions and depending on how many questions we have and how many you know how many people are in the in the live chat so I'd like to get at least two sessions and we'll see how it goes if you're not familiar with the strain the way things go is this is just my everyday work that I'm doing so whatever I need to work on in my normal job as a frontend developer I work on and I share it all with you I organize my work normally with in Pomodoro sessions so we do 25minute code sessions and then in between we take fiveminute breaks and I answer questions in the lab chat at the end of the stream I answer all the questions that that you all put in the live chat I welcome any questions and also comments and advice in the live chat as well let's see I think that's my normal I need to write down like my normal explanation for the channels I don't forget and then I can just rattle it off at the beginning also I have a secondary stream on Instagram so if you're watching on Instagram you can see my my monitors and all the code at free code camp on their YouTube channel so check out that YouTube channel and this video is titled styling react components in this project to day 30 so check that out if you want to see the code otherwise you'll just be seeing my face which won't be that helpful if you'd like to know more about styling react components all right so let's let's get started just you know really quickly showing what I've done the mainly my work has been other than setting up the server my work has been on this service request form if you remember we had a branch that was the file type check branch and we were doing some work with form validation on that branch that's now been merged into master I got it to the point where I thought you know it was it was ready not perfect but functional and so that's merged now in the master so if you're checking out the repository the links in the description the master branch now has has everything in it there are no side branches that are being worked on currently so here's what I've done and you can see so this is what it it did look like with the check boxes so we had basically you know these icons when you clicked it it just came up with an alert basically just to say like hey it works when you click on this and we had the check boxes now I've redone the check boxes so that a few few improvements so this was a really big step done by Sebastian and I just kind of finished that up over here and that now depending on what data you pass into the component you could get an icon that icon could be whatever you want it doesn't have to be the information icon and then when you click on it a modal opens you can pass in a title and then you can pass in HTML style you know however you want and currently this is this is what we have so just you know regular unordered list I'll show you all the code for this also you know the check boxes work now we have a separate component that so we're passing you know the click event up to the parent component which is this whole page I'll show you how that works so what I ended up doing was I split if you remember our problem was trying to get the check box and the icon together and being able to click on it get different information so that was we were just trying to figure out the best way to do that I think at some point last week so this is what I came up with so now instead of doing all this in the service request form which is already getting quite large I just separated out into another component so this is called the icon check box component so here's what we're doing the only state that we're even tracking here is just for the modal we're leaving the state for the check box itself whether or not it's checked here in the parent component of service request j/s because we want all that data all that form data to stay in state here so we can send it you know we can read that we can send it off to our server j/s file and then handle all that form data from there so that's why I left it here otherwise normally I would handle you know component state I mean assuming I wasn't you know using some other state management technique but for something basic I will probably just handle state right here in the component like I'm doing here but it makes more sense in this case to do it the parent component and I'm not using Redux or anything like that for this so I usually get people are you using redox or why don't you use redox so this is a simple enough react project that I didn't really think it needed Redux I'm also not that great with Redux yet to even be confident and implementing it but I am trying to learn currently on on another project okay so pretty basic we just have a handle dialogue open handle dialogue close okay this is nothing different than what we're already doing in this component with our dialogue for when when you submit the form so we actually didn't have a handle dialog open because that was handled in the form submission function so we just added that in now down here we have our check box and this is our material UI check box but then depending on the value for icon I think it's passed and let me show you on on the right side where we pass this in you can see this is a very large component it's yeah down here down here there we go I'm think I'm gonna make this a bit bigger a bit wider here it'll be a lot easier to read okay so here we go here's our icon check box components and you see it's capable of taking in a lot of a lot of properties so we're passing in things for the check box and these are all just normal things that you pass in for the material you I component the same thing that we're doing right down here this these checkboxes are the old way that we were doing it okay so it's the same thing the only thing that's even you know slightly different here is and on check we pass the event up right to our handle check here and then it calls handle input change and passes that event on right you see otherwise right we all we had to do was on check call handle input change but now that we've put this into another component we have to pass that event I actually had I had a big I spent a lot of time trying to troubleshoot this because I couldn't get it to work and it turns out I was doing everything right except I was passing in label here instead of name so it was trying to update the information in state for a component that didn't even exist I'm sorry for a checkbox that didn't exist right because the labels uppercase but the name is lowercase so anyway that was pretty frustrating definitely would have saved like a half an hour of kind of backandforth troubleshooting if I would have just passed in the right prop so that happens sometimes so anyway the checkbox like I said other than this it operates exactly the same and here's the kind of the new portion so if this is true so we have C we have icon here so basically within our data I guess I should share the data because that might make a little bit more sense so here's our data for our checkboxes so we can pass in a lot more now than we were before see before we basically a name info you can either put an icon false like we're doing here or it'll check and if the icon data doesn't even exist it'll automatically pass in false so I filled this in before I put this check in for that so but it really doesn't matter I'll probably end up taking out the icon false just to keep things a little bit a little bit shorter in here but in this case for that first check box you can see we're passing in the name the info text I'm actually not using this now so I'll get rid of this this was Sebastian and put this in just kind of more as an example like hey here's where you put in your data so we do have icon true now here's where we have that everything for the modal so we get passing the title for the modal and then for dialogue text we put in our HTML and I have this inside a template literal that way I don't have to worry about using single or double quotes inside of here it's just it's kind of easy I think I'm only using a single quote yeah so you know right here but potentially I could be using them you know in more places so if you can use template literal definitely recommend that if you're gonna put a lot of content in there so you can see this is just you know regular HTML normally I wouldn't want to have like huge blocks of HTML in here but we're not really gonna do this often in fact this my be the only checkbox that even gets extra info so we'll see maybe once the people in my department see that this is possible they might want extra info for some other things as well but I don't think we'll have anything nearly this big otherwise our data file is gonna get huge okay so there's our data and you can see we're passing that in so here's the icon so we have this as an image and then our source is just gonna be our source from the source with the SVG is so let me go up to the top here's who we're bringing in that so we're importing info logo from image info dot SVG all right so we're pulling that in here and then we're passing it in props so we could pass in anything we wanted in terms of a logo really we could bring in a source for an image if we wanted to I guess I don't know how great that would look probably not that good since we're intending it to be a logo but and then we are also putting in an alt tag currently I think I just have hardcoded let me double check on that I do it just says info button really I think we just need an alt or else it'll react I'll complain either reactor I don't know if it's specific to create rec react app but I'm pretty sure that's what was happening before so I mean it's a good idea to have alt text anyway if I get a new situation where I have lots of different logos in here then I'd probably want to put it in our data file and pass incorrect alt text but right now the only thing we're gonna have our info button so that works all right and that's it to get the the logo and we have you know some positioning here but other than that we have our dialogue so this is our material UI dialog component and we're just passing in the title and then here this is how we can use the HTML so inside of this dialog component I have a span and we're dangerously setting the inner HTML you can't do that on the actual dialog component itself because this component ends up outputting you know several other divs inside of it so I've tried tried it it does not work so you need to put a span inside and then anything inside here is going to be put in the right place within that modal within that dialog so we just have a span here we're setting the dangerously setting the interests UML if we didn't do it like this then the user would actually see all the HTML tags when you do this though it's a good idea to only do this if you have complete control of the data you're not gonna have like users submitted data in there but as long as you have control your data this is fine even though it it seems dangerous it's it's completely fine if if you know for sure what's going to be coming through here okay and that's that's pretty much it that's all I've done yeah at least that's all I can remember that I've done since yesterday so I just need to apply that same thing to this side and we need to do a bit of styling so that we don't have this huge gap between checkboxes so we can come back to that styling but I'd like to work on the home page first all right because this is what this will people are gonna see right off the bat if there's any page I want to spend the most time on in terms of style it's definitely going to be the home page it's entirely possible that the majority of people won't see you know a lot of these other these other views but we know you know this looks really plain I'd like to put in I have some ideas for what I'd like to put in so let's just try them out and see if you all have any ideas for what make this look a bit less plain I mean I'm I'm really I like the clean look but this is almost sterile you know it's it's like beyond clean at this point so like to add a little bit in maybe a little bit of color possibly some icons we'll see I don't want to go crazy with the icons then it's it's just kind of hard you know you want to try to find different types of icons when you end up throwing things in there that don't even they don't then make sense so I'd rather not put an IKE I'd rather not just throw in icons just for something to look at if they don't mean really mean anything so first we're just going to try adding in some color and see how that looks like I said I wonder trying to get about the screen this is more like the screen size that's common here at the University so I'd like to try try to keep that in mind as we're styling this so my monitor is way bigger than the normal screen size of people that work here yeah I think that's about it off the double check the analytics and see what kind of screens we get mostly I do want to double check the live chat let's see okay I just want to remember to check in case you know occasionally I'm doing something really wrong and you all let me know a lot in the live chat so didn't want to go too long without at least taking a peek at it here's what I'm thinking I'd like to maybe put a border on the left of each of these titles and I'd like to mess around with some of the different colors that are available in the university's color palette and just see how it looks I'm not you know I kind of have an idea in my head of how it will look but you never know until you really you know get it on there and see not really sure how would it look to with the colors you know should we do more than one how many more should we alternate so let's just do it and see what it looks like so this maybe we'll put I think I'd like to add a class to this I guess to this span yeah we're gonna have to do it to this span let's see let's check out our components see how this is we may not be able to easily add a class but if we just select the first fan I think we should be fine so let's see we're using the component for a components generic car that's it yes we're using a generic card and card header so there's the title okay so it's in the card title okay I don't want to put it in this style here because like we saw here this applies I should make this a bit bigger it's easy for you to see see if you can see here that styling is applied I believe that's applied to this div and if I try to put a border on this dev it's gonna be bigger than we want so I want to target that span yeah all right let's do that let's just try to do it in in CSS then unless I mean it's possible that there's a way to target that interior span with material UI but I'm guessing not just from what I've seen from the other components that we worked with so let's go leave our home dot s CSS file and let's actually bring out our home component and the card container all right let's see if this will allow us to to get that span there we go so we have okay all right that should work I guess I could have just used flex then like I did up here but if I'm using what I want to avoid is having these styles spill over into other places where I don't want them so that's why we added this here okay and I will say when you're doing styles for react there are so many ways right now to do it this is just one of those those ways there are a lot of different ways to do your CSS right in the component and then in this particular way we're using sass which certainly don't have to use so I don't I don't want to make it seem like this is the way to do it this is just one way to do it and in fact we did it very differently on the last project so if you want to see an alternative you could check that out but we just you know we happen to be doing it this way on this project I I have not made up my mind as to what way I like the best so I'm still kind of trying different things out and hopefully at some point I'll settle on on some consistent way of doing it but I'm not there yet okay and let's go with for now we can just target the span because the other span right now is a height of zero pixels so I mean we'll see in a second but it shouldn't it shouldn't do anything if we put a border on that so let's go the border left and solid let's try let's try two pixels we may have to go three but I want to see what looks like first and then I don't what color I want to try first I'm gonna grab let's grab this color and I need to set up my sash right now is not set up it's not taking advantage of a lot of things that SAS can do and it should it should be just haven't really taken the time to get everything set up properly yet you know normally we would want to be importing all our variables into our SAS files so that we could use those variables so you know for sure our color variables your color palette we want to have them be all variables but you know probably some other things as well all right yeah that's terrible I don't like that okay here's what we need to do all right so this definitely needs to be more than two pixels I'm gonna go three pixels right now and yeah I don't like that all right let's try this out so let's decrease our line height we're gonna make our lion height the same as our font size now that brings this kind of shrinks it up a little bit too much but okay so that's in line so we're gonna have to use important we're gonna have to use important to override those inline Styles you do want to be careful when you use important because obviously it's it's going to be more difficult if you you're basically undoing the cascading nature of cascading style sheets when you use something like this so you don't use it all the time but in this case this is just so much easier than trying to dig into the components and figure out I just really don't want to edit the material UI components directly I'd rather try to do things on top of that and we want to add in some padding left of let's try four pixels we'll see how that looks okay all right yeah I like that and we won margin what a margin on the bottom and the top of let's go with eight pixels and then went zero on the sides okay yeah that gives us back to the same spacing that we had originally or at least pretty close to it now I think I'd like to have our text lined up so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go we'll go we'll keep our eight pixels on top we'll go zero on the right and then we'll do eight pixels on the bottom and then on the left I'm gonna go with negative let's see we're doing padding there four pixels let's go negative let's it's gonna probably gonna be too much we'll try it first just to start okay that's not bad it's pretty close yeah I think seven seven is better right that makes sense because we've added a 4 pixel padding left and then we have a 3 pixel border so 7 pixels puts us back where you were that way we have our text lined up I think that looks a bit nicer let me know what you think though okay so we have this did we put our padding in already I think I'm gonna copy both of these and we're gonna have to use did I add these I don't think we'll have to use important because I think I added these both in so let's see if it works I'm gonna save that yep all right so it did work so now we have a little bit of color I'm not I don't really know if I like it or not let's see my timer did go off a few minutes ago and I just wanted to finish that up so you have something to look at I'm gonna take a short break now and go to the live chat and see what you all think and also if there's any questions I'll try to answer as many as I can in this is five minutes okay so John John Hanson says I believe most react components work best passing down function rather than passing up is this true JavaScript and suffer from bubbling can this happen in react to yet I guess I think this question probably came when we were going over the icon checkbox and passing us up so basically yeah normally you do want to pass things down to from parent to child and react but sometimes you have to in certain situations like this one you you do have a child component and it needs to let the parent component know what's happening normally I've only had this situation happen where I have inputs that are in child components and I need to let the parent component know if something is changed with that input so there are probably other situations where you'd want to but I haven't dealt with them yeah yeah probably inputs are the the main thing so in that case I I think I haven't found any negative let's see side effects from from doing it like that not to say that they don't exist I just haven't encountered them yet pravin ask what is react learning curve I mean how much time will it take for basic JavaScript developer angularjs new developer to learn react jeaious and react native it's hard to say how much time really because that depends it depends on how much time you have to dedicate to it every day that I get to learning it and how quick of a learner you are and how much you already know so it's really it would be hard to say I can only speak for myself I started working with reacts I want to say it's been less than a year since I've been working with react so it took me it took me probably a few months before I before I actually launched a react site for a client before that you know I I just done some some things just to learn really I didn't have all day to dedicate to it I was working on other projects that weren't you know where I wasn't using react so I would I would say if you could dedicate let's say you could dedicate all your time to it you can get pretty good with reacting in a month or less you know I'm talking like fulltime learning you know building things otherwise if you're working a fulltime job you know you have those projects you know I'd say a couple of months but like I said it's really hard to say it's it's kind of an individual thing there's a lot of factors that would go into that some guy responds respond to that question learn JavaScript first at least the basics up to objects and go through x6 then start learning concepts of react mainly components yes I mean you're definitely going to need to know some JavaScript to be able to know react you don't need to be an expert in JavaScript oh certainly you'll your JavaScript skills will get better as you learn react as well so if you if you did want to jump into react it's it's probably fine you know if you have limited knowledge of JavaScript it'll just be harder to get through react but you know eventually your skills will they'll have to get better if you want to be good at react perviness is es6 necessary to learn react I don't necessary to know all of the Essex but es6 will help make things easier I mean even even just the syntactic sugar part of es6 will make things easier but yeah I would say it's not like there's that much to es6 or es2015 whatever I I read a comment to a blog post earlier where somebody was so mad that someone said es8 instead of es 2017 so I don't wanna make anybody mad officially I think it's we're going with the es 2015 16 17 but in any case yeah you can get started with react without great knowledge of es6 but it's your life will be easier if you learn it and then Praveen says can you suggest some links or references to learn and let's see some suggestions were Codecademy yeah I've done their react stuff that's good Udacity has a react course it's paid though so it depends on your budget for you know for learning materials for react if you want to stick with the free stuff code Academy is good and then I mean there's so many YouTube videos that could be helpful lets trying to think learn code Academy is a YouTube channel that has a lot of good videos and has some serious on react actually earlier today I was just watching a video on Redux on that channel I think will Stern is the guy that does all the videos on that channel so you can check that out the react tutorials on that channel are a little bit older so there might be some updates to the way things are done but the overall concepts are still the same and react so those would be just off the top of my head that's probably one of the best channels that I've personally watched for react stuff on YouTube and then certainly you know these streams you'll pick up a lot about react on these streams but these you know it's not really a tutorial so there'll be a lot of gaps like this is not a systematic way of learning react it's just you get to see what I happen to be doing at 200 p.m. every day okay all right my time I did go off so I'm not through the chat so I'm gonna have to come back to that so if I didn't get to your question yet don't worry I'll get to it in our next break or towards the end of the stream and if you can't stick around for the live stream to get the answer you can always check out the recording that's available on a free code camp YouTube channel later on and then you'll be able to hear the answer answer there let's see all right let's reset this do another 25minute session okay I'm gonna scroll down to the bottom and see if anyone had any comments on the styles okay all right so John Hanson is not a fan of the border on the left okay I don't think I'm thinking anybody else so if anybody else has an opinion on this let me know like I said after I saw it I'm not I don't hate it but I'm not I'm not sure that this is exactly what what we need here I mean I think maybe it's better than nothing it's part of the thing that that is bothering me about this too is that we have this this one card this the title is going it down on the two lines there's not really anything we can do about that yes I mean we can try you know know what I would like to try I think I want this text this how can Markham help you text to be permanently closer to the top and then have these centered so basically right now this is vertically centered but the entire div is vertically centered including this so what what happens is all of this appears to not be centered it appears to be towards the bottom more so what I'd like to do is take this out of that div so this isn't taken into consideration for the centering and then have these come up a little bit I think depending on the screen size it's not going to be that big of a difference but I do think it'll help it will help out a blank space on the bottom is not as big of a deal as blank space on the top when there's blank space on the top it really I think feels like there's something missing but the bottom of the page is you know that's just the bottom right it's not as big of a deal at least I don't know at least in my mind that's that's how it seems to me so let's uh let's do that I want to do that for sure and then we can think more about what we're gonna do in terms of color in here John says how about a four pixel top border on each card with the same color okay so we could do yeah I guess I guess we could try that so we'll try that too let me get rid of this because I know for sure that I want to kind of mess with this vertical centering a bit and then we'll try that border on the top so John just just to be clear are we talking like border that stretches completely across the card I think that would look the best I'm assuming that's what we're talking about okay John also says don't take the heading out of the div just add padding to the bottom to Center it better all right let's see that's it we'll make this bigger just to kind of exaggerate the issue as well so we can see what's going on here I'm just I'm wondering would it look see it because in this case it's really obvious you know if we had this so that it was always up at the top you know there's a huge difference here I'm kind of wondering if maybe it was a mistake to vertically Center this maybe it would be better if this was just you know at the top I don't know let me know what you all think about that is originally we did not have this vertically centered and I said it's not as big of a deal on a smaller screen when you end up getting into larger sizes it's just there's just so much space up here I don't I don't know that that that looks right all right so let's we'll try a few things and see see what looks best okay so here's our actually let's just let's take this out and see what it would look like that'll be the easiest thing to check so here's what it looks like without being vertically centered okay I yeah I like I think this looks good and it looks like at least a few you agree much better okay great yeah I agree I think that does look a lot better I can't I can't remember what we were thinking originally with that vertical Center I mean it was cool when we did it at least it was a nice demonstration of how to do a vertical Center with with flexbox but yeah definitely definitely looks better okay we'll leave it like that now let's try out that that top border actually though I didn't think about this either but we could potentially do a a border on the side that takes up the entire height of the card so what do you think well I'll try them both we'll try a top border and then we'll also try the side border maybe I'll do it on on two different cards here so we can see it side by side okay maybe I can just do it right here in dev tools I'll get fry just copy copy this edit it a bit okay so here's our left our left border and let's do the same thing over here but we're gonna do top and we'll make this 4 as well okay all right so what do y'all think on the side on the top or I definitely don't think bottom would look good but we could we could try on the right as well okay Zachary asked if I'm feeling better I don't know I feel kind of the same so if you watch the last last show I was not feeling well so still about the same my throat hurts a little bit less than it did though so that's good but I started I'm a little bit congested so I don't know if I'm getting better it's just transitioning into something different but I'm still so just tired that's that's the worst thing is like I just I feel like I have no energy but I'm starting to get some of my focus back I feel like today the last like two weeks I just feel like my work has not been great I don't know if it's been evident in the streams or not but it just feels I don't know I feel like I'm not doing good work like I'm having trouble focusing on my work and so anyway today I finally like really made an effort to really try to focus and like work through the the tiredness and I think I did I think I did a decent job on that logo checkbox component and I worked through some some bugs and stuff and so hopefully this is the start of me getting back into it but just just tired and just lack of motivation that's what's bothering me the most anyway thanks for asking Zachary sorry for the big explanation I know you all may not have wanted that much information but it I wanted to give everybody a chance to weigh in on these anyway so it was a good point a good time to talk a bit all right so I'm gonna check out what everyone said okay so it looks like left left just listening to service okay so oh man so we did have a bunch of votes four on the left on the side now we have some for the top someone did say so Laura said make it at the left border when you mouseover all right so we don't we don't really have consensus here here's what I'm gonna do I think it might be better if we saw what it would look like if all of them had had the border so we'll try I'll do all of them with the the top border I'll take a screenshot and we'll do all with the border on the side and then we can look at them side by side that might give us a better idea since we're we're kind of torn right now so let's take let's take this for now and okay so for now let's do this and instead let me check okay so try this one first oops and I'll get rid of this whoops I said it order laughs we were to that one okay so let me screenshot this loose let me make sure that worked I don't think it did and I can't remember I just do one of these then I can't remember how to do a just a regular screenshot on on a Mac this one is gonna copy it to my clipboard how do I do it alright somebody help me out on a Mac what's the shortcut to do a screenshot that will automatically save to my desktop I always just use the one where it's copy to clipboard that's the command ctrl shift 4 is it okay there we go now I now I heard the little click command all right now weird this safe I think this is it all right great okay so now we'll change it oops okay so not exactly equivalent here okay what do you think top or side now that we can see them side by side also I'm not opposed to some sort of hover effect so I mean obviously we already have I don't want to overdo it right we already have a hover effect going on here so if we were add anything else having to do with this border it wouldn't it would need to be subtle so I'll give everybody maybe like 20 seconds more to let me know what your thing okay it looks like all right we we have we have a lot of votes for left now we definitely have one for top we have an undecided Patrick says we could change maybe change the border color on hover yeah I think that's definitely I definitely want to see how it looks I'm not sure try to picture in my head I'm not sure if it'll work or not but I think it's worth a try I think we're gonna go with the left then it seems like it's now that we've seen them side by side it seems like it's pretty almost unanimous oh my goodness I keep my my slack channel for work is just going crazy I keep hearing the the noise that I've got a new message so I don't think I keep glancing at it it's nothing that I need to respond to you right now but it's a little bit distracting all right so let's go with this I do want to check let's let's see about changing the color also yeah we'll see about changing the color and then we'll see you know is this enough to make the page not quite so plain you know not not so stark so I'm still thinking about it now that I see this I wonder if I should get rid of the borderradius on this side if that would look nicer I know cards normally you're supposed to have a two picture borderradius of material design but with this border on the side I don't know that I like it being slightly rounded I mean that maybe I'm worrying too much about that but let's try that I do let's try getting rid of the border radius on this side with the border and then also doing a change of color on hover where it is top left oops I'm going bottom shoot how does he area let's try I don't know if I have any of the other colors we'll put this color in for now just to see may want to go with a different color there are a few there's a dark blue and a light blue that's in the the cool color palette for the University which is generally what I like to use for websites we have a warm color palette that has some Reds in there but I just I'm not crazy about how it looks on a screen it's definitely better for print materials let's show this up they don't get the auto reload hmm I bet you that I have to do all right so that works but I think for this I'll probably have to do important so I'm not even gonna check I'm just gonna do it since we're just testing this out anyway there we go okay so hmm you see the difference well I guess that's on the top hmm okay so I guess two things one what do you think about the color the change of color and the second thing is what about the borderradius I mean is it even noticeable let's I'm gonna get rid of that here and just try it try to just do it on one and dev tools okay so now we can see I guess better the difference so the top one has no border radius for this side and then this bottom one it has the normal two pixel border radius I don't know I want to know what you all think for me now that I look at this it I don't think it looks right it almost seems like this is now not part of the card especially around the edges like it just looks I don't know it looks like it's just added or like this definitely looks like it's within the card here I don't know what do y'all think use the green did I use the green yeah okay this it's it's probably just some type of weird thing going on with my eyes when the transition from the yellow but that this looks blue to me when I hover over it like this obviously looks green but for some reason this board is looking blue all right so Johnson keep the border radius okay alright Johnson the border color needs to be a bit softer so I'm assuming you mean like this yellow and so it seems like we're going to so we're not going to change the border radius and okay and then we're probably gonna soften this color or we could try different colors I need to bring in the some of the other the colors from the like the blues and stuff and see if one of those looks look good here as well I mean normally this yellow ends up being like the accent color anyway but I have used some of the Blues before and especially the the dark blue is nice I've used it before and it's it's pretty nice occasionally to use it's just not it's not really recognizable as a color for our University even though it is in the color palette it's not it's not often used but that was the end of my Poe Maduro session so I'm gonna do another five minutes to go back to the live chat I'm going to scroll back up to where I left off on our last break and go through and and just answer some more questions so I'm scrolling all the way up to the way the timestamp is 227 p.m. for me it'll be different depending on your timezone but that's Eastern Time 227 p.m. okay say god says by the way great work all at precode camp thank you I appreciate that and at least thanks for the little bit that I'm doing things you're saying that I know there's a lot of people a lot of people don't work for free code camp and a lot of people that you never even hear about or don't you know don't know about so definitely the just a ton of volunteers making it making it have everything the free code camp does the YouTube channel the website the the blogs the forum a lot of a lot of volunteers behind all that Oh pravin mentioned YouTube's new darkthemed yeah I think the dark thing for YouTube is really cool so I just I just wanted to read that comment out so if you haven't checked it out yet check out the settings on on YouTube and try the dark theme I think I like dark themes for pretty much everything so I was really excited when that came out Juno says greetings from Costa Rica welcome thanks for watching Kat bill says styled components is is quite nice library for creating beautiful react components yeah yeah definitely I think before you know I was saying there's lots of different ways to style react components that's definitely one of the ways that that I've seen and like I said I'd like to try more of them out before I decide which one I want to stick with mainly no beer says hi from Bangladesh hey welcome thanks for watching Daniel says hi Jessie and guys from Romania hey Daniel welcome no beer says hi I'm new here well welcome really glad that that you're watching thank you and thanks for for letting us know that you're here in the live chat feel free to contribute or ask any questions and try to try to give you the best answers that I can and there's a lot of the really knowledgeable people here in the live chat that can definitely give you some great answers some guy asks are you using bootstrap for mobile responsive no I'm not using bootstrap I'm using the tier of UI so I guess it's not exactly the same as bootstrap since material I comes with these premade react components but it's the same concept in the sense that there's a lot of styling things that are that are already there although now that I think about it in terms of the responsiveness right some of that we did borrow from a framework called materialized CSS so which which is very much like bootstrap so essentially materialized is a material design CSS framework that does all the same things that bootstrap does but just in the material design style so we did borrow the mainly we borrow their column class system to help you know with the different screen sizes and kind of stacking the columns and things and we borrowed a few other things so so that's that's how we're handling responsiveness right now all right timer just is up so last one sir key gaming says I started free code camp about five days ago and got to the tribute page but it seems like hardly any of the things I learned stuck would you say that's normal or is there other things I can do let's see Lara's response to that it's normal just jump back and look over things go search on the web if you can't do things you want to do asking the Gator channel if you're really stuck yeah yeah definitely sometimes things don't stick the only way to really have things stick in your head is repetition I found and I don't mean in the sense of like getting it flashcards and memorizing like commands but just actually building things like day in day out you know building things with whatever you're trying to learn a little bit every day is much better than you know like twelve hours one day and then nothing for two weeks right so if you were to spread that out and just do you know an hour or so every day you're definitely going to get more out of that it's going to stay fresh in your brain and you know you you will remember that so alright let's go let me check the time okay what do you I'm trying to decide whether we should do another session or whether I should go to questions now we're already at about an hour and 20 minutes for the video if I do another session it's definitely going to be a twohour video for sure I will my throat is I can feel my my throat just getting more sore as this goes on when I keep talking man let me see how much we have left in the in the chat I'm only about halfway through right now all right front so I think I'm not gonna do another Promotora session we only got two in but I think at this point I'd rather I'd rather end now and save my voice so that I can do sessions for the next two days then try to overdo it and lose my voice so at least we got we got through the homepage which as I said I think the homepage is the most important to get styling right this is the first thing people are going to see and they're gonna make a judgment on the site based on this so I don't know I think this looks a lot better from what we had just an hour ago definitely got a lot of good advice from you all so thanks and I'm definitely gonna mess around with the colors a bit and see see what color combinations might work and then I you know tomorrow we can we can check it out and review you know which colors look the best but for now so I'm gonna stop the code portion and I'm gonna go to the question and answer session so if you just here for the code and you can't stick around for the question answer session thank you so much for watching and I'll be back tomorrow so you know come back if you can and otherwise if you can stick around you have a few more minutes and if you have a question please put that in the live chat now I'll do my best to answer it and any any type of question don't worry if you think it's like a new question or anything you know don't worry about that you know I definitely want to be as welcoming as possible to people who are new and help you out any way that I can if you don't really have a question I appreciate you sticking around and helping to answer questions and a live chat you know if you can if you have the time so I said I'm about halfway through the live chat now so I'm just gonna keep on going down and try to answer things once we get through all the questions and I'll I'll be finished with the stream so I'm thinking we'll see probably streaming for at least another ten minutes kind of based on how many how much is left in the live chat but we'll see sometimes I talk for a while so we'll see definitely want to keep this below two hours just cuz just because I'm pretty tight alright shine as what is better react or view in the future well I mean I don't really know about what's gonna happen with them in the future and I'll say I don't think I can answer that question properly because I haven't used view yet I certainly have seen you know people who are well respected in the industry I guess and they really like view and they use it so I've you know I'm assuming that there's some really good things about view but I don't really know enough to do a comparison about it but in terms of react the only thing going against react right now that I see is like a serious thing that could threaten how widely it's used is the whole license thing you know there's a there's a lot of people that are freaking out over the license and I don't really know how many people but based on what's going on on Twitter it seems like a lot of people are now I know Twitter is just a small a small portion of all the people in the world and all the developers so maybe it's not as big of a deal as it seems like on Twitter but other than that it seems like react is pretty strong this there's more and more people developing with react if you look at like the trends just in terms of like Google search trends and things or the number of jobs that are you asking for reactive elders it's it's going strong it's still on the on the trend upward so I'm not really worried about react going anywhere anytime soon also I think there's a lot of opportunity in terms of react native and being able to use react for VR stuff I think that's really cool and potentially like depending on how quickly VR grows react could grow right along with that I don't know you know there's just a lot of a lot of whatifs there but I think you're probably either either way with react or review you got at least a few more years before you'd have to think about learning something different okay you know what I did notice this before but Oh Morris had mentioned when we were doing these boxes to expand the boxes and it would be better huh that's interesting okay so yeah potentially I mean obviously on a smaller screen right there the boxes are fine but on a large screen there is quite a lot of space you know maybe maybe I should think about expanding them maybe adding some sort of at a certain breakpoint you know just having a minimum height and width well maybe I'll have to mess with that a little bit and see see what works if that looks a little bit better than then all this blank space I'd say thanks for that suggestion Omar okay our reo says thing is mouseover already add shadow effect so we're talking about the shadow yeah I I agree there we do already have that shadow effect which is why I'm still not a hundred percent sure even about the color change thing I'm not I'm not totally against it but I just wonder is it necessary since we already have the the shadow you know getting the shadow increasing on hover I'm just I'm not really a big fan of doing too much on hover so we'll have to yeah I'll have to think about it I mean one bonus is if I decide not to do the color change thing and then we don't that's one less color I have to worry about picking so it simplifies it a bit if we do that I mean in terms of code it's it's trivial to add that effect you know it's just one line but in terms of thinking about the best color combination for that that's what that's what takes a lot that's what all second guess okay now I see a lot of people help me out with the shortcut for screenshotting on a Mac so thanks everyone who who answered that sorry I just totally forgot that that's your cut that happens sometimes I guess okay scrolling through actually a lot of the stuff in the live chat was based on just kind of what we were doing here so that's why I'm skipping over a lot of it because we've already talked about it somebody put a hex code in I want to see what the hex code is so I'm just I'm gonna put it in here but it's just popping in the background to see what it is okay I like that green color I can't use it here because I'm really kind of limited to the official color palette for the University but that's a really nice color anyway thanks you that Pavel thanks for they sue putting that X color in I kind of really it's like a nice like chill color green anyway just wanted to check it out we're not we're not gonna use that but I do like it get get seen says talk about sanitizing user inputs once you style them with styled components I guess did we do I don't think we've done anything on a stream about sanitizing input so maybe there's not going to be a lot of streams left before this projects finished but maybe I'll think about talking about that more on an on an upcoming stream one thing we don't because we don't have a database for this I'm not I'm not super worried about sanitizing inputs in terms of like I don't have to worry about something like like sequel injection there's something like that so I mean where I don't want to just allow anything so but it's not there's no danger of something weird happening with the database but anyway that's if I can in the few streams that we'll have left for this project I'll definitely talk about sanitizing user inputs Gouffran says sometimes using material design looks too generic for me no offense yeah that's the I think that's that's kind of what's happening with material design I don't completely disagree so I still like material design and I'm still going to continue to use it there's I think there's a lot of good reasons to use material design one of the main ones being it's there's just really common patterns design patterns in material design that a lot of people are familiar with now because of how widely it's used and I think there's a real benefit to that so that a user coming to your site or to your app would immediately be familiar with how the navigation works what certain icons mean you know not everybody will but you have there's a good chance that a decent portion of your audience will already be familiar with that and that to me is a really big benefit so I agree that sometimes it just looks generic and and that really is it's because it's used so widely it's just not you see it everywhere now so I like how clean it can look I mean that's really nice but I mean I agree to some extent that it's not I wouldn't use it if I was trying to win a design contest or something like that you know if I was doing some project on the side where I could be as creative as I wanted to be I would not use it but if I'm designing something and use your experience in terms of just usability ease of use was the main focus and you know design aesthetics where we're still important but not the main focus then I'm definitely going to use material design so anyway that's just that's my opinion on it I'm certainly open to hearing more one way the other about it but but in a sense I mean I don't I don't use material design necessarily because of the the look of it itself there's definitely other benefits that that it brings to the table you know more so than just the look John said gargle with warm salt water one of the best things for a sore throat thanks for telling me I'll definitely have to do that I always forget I know that helps but for some reason I always forget to do it oh I'll have to remember to do that bobble says thanks for the stream oh you're welcome papa thanks for watching and joining in in the live chat Bob also says my first time but I would like to continue these sessions no beer says me too yeah so that's really awesome that it's your first time for both of you and I'm really glad that you want to you know continue on with the sessions so definitely if you if you can make it four lives for the live streams that's really awesome because then we get to interact you know in real time but if you can't you know you can always check out the recordings one of the benefits of watching the recordings too is that you can watch it at a faster speed and get through it more quickly I listen to I had heard some of you say that you had listened to it at kind of a faster speed and I tried it over the weekend listening to my one of my streams at two times speed and I actually liked it a lot better into time speed I think I sound like I know what I'm talking about a lot more just because I'm saying it all faster and it looks like I'm typing faster too so it definitely makes me look better at two times speed so if you can't catch the lies chain check that out Antonius Asiya follow you in and Twitter best regards awesome well you're probably not here since you he said see ya but anyway in case you are here you see they're recording I appreciate

something now I have her my throat but thank you so much for joining in in the live chat I really appreciate you all were so helpful especially when I do things like this and try to add some design elements that kind of go a little bit beyond this the general material design specifications it's so nice to have all of you be able to take a look at it and let me know what you think it just it's really nice I really I appreciate all your input I really respect your opinions on on this and so this is really awesome when we get to collaborate on something like this I think the end result is
