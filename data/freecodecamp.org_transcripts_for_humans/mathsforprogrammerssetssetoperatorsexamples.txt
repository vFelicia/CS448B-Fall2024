00:00 - in this video i will be using vent
00:02 - diagrams to give a graphical
00:03 - representation of the set operators we
00:06 - learned in the previous video
00:08 - so if you recall the definition of a
00:10 - union b you know that a union b equals
00:12 - the set containing elements x such that
00:15 - x is an element of a or x is an element
00:18 - of b
00:19 - so if we let this circle represent the
00:21 - set a and we let this circle represent
00:23 - the set b
00:24 - then
00:25 - that means that x can land anywhere
00:28 - in any of these circles which is why
00:30 - this right the entire region is shaded
00:32 - red we're saying that this red region
00:35 - represents all possible values of x
00:38 - and if we recall the definition of a of
00:40 - a intersection b
00:42 - that equals the set containing elements
00:44 - x such that x is an element of a
00:46 - and x is an element of b
00:48 - which is why the overlap
00:51 - where a and b overlap is is shaded red
00:53 - we're saying all possible values of x
00:56 - are this red region now the set
00:58 - difference of a and b equals the set
01:01 - containing elements x
01:02 - such that x is an element of a
01:05 - and x is also not an element of b which
01:08 - is why it's just this region here none
01:10 - of the
01:12 - elements are within
01:13 - b
01:14 - the set difference of b and a
01:17 - is
01:18 - the set containing elements x such that
01:21 - x is an element of b
01:23 - and x is not an element of a and finally
01:27 - the symmetric difference of a and b i
01:29 - defined as
01:30 - the union of a minus b and b minus a so
01:35 - we take
01:36 - this region in this region and we take
01:39 - the union of it which is why this is the
01:41 - resulting region there's no overlap
01:44 - between the two
01:45 - now this is a really good way to
01:47 - familiarize yourself with the concept of
01:50 - set operators however don't rely on it
01:53 - you should really focus on the
01:54 - definitions as it will help you out in
01:57 - the long term

in this video i will be using vent diagrams to give a graphical representation of the set operators we learned in the previous video so if you recall the definition of a union b you know that a union b equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a or x is an element of b so if we let this circle represent the set a and we let this circle represent the set b then that means that x can land anywhere in any of these circles which is why this right the entire region is shaded red we're saying that this red region represents all possible values of x and if we recall the definition of a of a intersection b that equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a and x is an element of b which is why the overlap where a and b overlap is is shaded red we're saying all possible values of x are this red region now the set difference of a and b equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a and x is also not an element of b which is why it's just this region here none of the elements are within b the set difference of b and a is the set containing elements x such that x is an element of b and x is not an element of a and finally the symmetric difference of a and b i defined as the union of a minus b and b minus a so we take this region in this region and we take the union of it which is why this is the resulting region there's no overlap between the two now this is a really good way to familiarize yourself with the concept of set operators however don't rely on it you should really focus on the definitions as it will help you out in the long term
