00:02 - okay we are at the audit tab of chrome
00:05 - developer tools the page i have pulled
00:07 - up is on codepen it's my zip line for
00:09 - the random quote generator uh this one's
00:12 - get get up dress up show up and never
00:14 - give up that's a quote that i really
00:15 - like um so the audit is really useful
00:18 - it basically takes a picture of your
00:20 - whole page when it runs and it walks you
00:22 - through step by step every way that it
00:25 - thinks you know using these algorithms
00:27 - it thinks that your code could be
00:28 - improved so let's see what happens let's
00:31 - um
00:32 - let's reload the page and audit on load
00:34 - let's see what happens
00:36 - oh okay
00:37 - so i like about this tab it is so
00:40 - detailed which for me i don't
00:41 - necessarily know all the complex things
00:44 - that it's been talking about so far but
00:46 - these i can understand so compressing
00:48 - the following resource with gzip could
00:50 - reduce their transfer size by about
00:51 - two-thirds so that is something that's
00:54 - network utilization that's probably on
00:55 - the codepen side
00:57 - so that's an awesome suggestion they
00:59 - give a specific thing that you could do
01:00 - to help and exactly how it would help
01:02 - just because it's on this audit page
01:04 - doesn't mean you have to do it but it's
01:06 - definitely something you should take
01:07 - into consideration
01:09 - let's look at web page performance
01:11 - remove unused css rules see that's
01:13 - probably me i probably have some unused
01:15 - css rules that are there
01:17 - inline block number one sixty percent is
01:19 - not used by the current page
01:21 - button append author so i'm gonna have
01:23 - to go back and look at that because if i
01:25 - delete that it would probably still run
01:27 - just as well and it would have less code
01:29 - to go through so it'd be faster and more
01:31 - efficient
01:32 - use normal css property names instead of
01:35 - vendor prefixed ones
01:38 - that is a css thing that is for
01:41 - codepen that one's not me but i take
01:42 - full responsibility for these other ones
01:44 - up here um what i want you to take away
01:46 - from this audit page is once you have
01:49 - something up and running just run the
01:50 - audit it will catch some things and that
01:53 - maybe you wouldn't have previously
01:54 - thought of and while you don't have to
01:55 - do them it might open your eyes to some
01:57 - things that you weren't aware of that
01:59 - could really improve the performance of
02:00 - your page
